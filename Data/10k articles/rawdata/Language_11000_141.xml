      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5244">[[Image:TV-line-count-world.svg|thumb|right|300px|SDTV resolution by nation; countries using 480i are in green.]]
'''480i''' is a shorthand name for the [[video]] mode used for [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]] [[analog television|analog]] or [[digital television|digital]] [[television]] in [[Caribbean]], [[Myanmar]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Philippines]], [[Laos]], [[Western Sahara]], and most of the [[Americas]] (with the exception of [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Uruguay]]). The ''480'' identifies a vertical resolution of 480 lines, and the ''i'' identifies it as an [[Interlacing|interlaced]] resolution. The [[field rate]], which is 60 [[Hz]] (or 59.94 Hz when used with NTSC color), is sometimes included when identifying the video mode, i.e. '''480i60'''; another notation, endorsed by both the [[International Telecommunication Union]] in [[BT.601]] and SMPTE in [[SMPTE 259M]], includes the [[frame rate]], as in '''480i/30'''. The other common standard, used in the other parts of the world, is [[576i]].

In analogue contexts, this resolution is often called "'''525 lines'''". It is mandated by [[CCIR System M|CCIR Systems M and J]], which are usually paired with '''[[NTSC]]''' color - which led to the "NTSC" name being often inaccurately used to refer to this video mode. Other color encodings have also been used with System M, notably [[PAL-M]] in [[Brazil]].

==Technical details==
For analog NTSC, there are a total of 525 scanning lines of which originally 483 lines were visible (241.5 visible lines + 21 lines of vertical blanking per field) and later 480 (240 complete lines per field). [For quad video recording systems, the math suggests 15 transverse head passes, each consisting of 16 lines of video, are required to complete one field.]  A full frame consists of two fields.  One field contains the odd-numbered lines and the other contains the even ones. By convention an NTSC video frame is considered to start with an even field followed by an odd field. The disparity of the line numbering compared to other systems is solved by defining the line numbering to start five equalizing pulses (or 2 and a half lines) earlier than on all other systems (including Systems A and E even though they had no equalizing pulses) on the first equalizing pulse following an active line or half line. This has the effect of placing a half line of video at the end of the even (first) field and the beginning of the odd (second field). Thus the line numbers correspond to the real lines of the video frame. On all other systems, the field was considered to start with the falling edge of the first field pulse which gave the confusing position that the odd field (first) had a half a line of video occupying the latter half of a whole line and ended with a whole line of video but half a scanning line (and vice versa for the even field). The NTSC convention solved this confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Report 308-2 of the XIIth Planiary of the CCIR - Characteristics of TV systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

For DV-NTSC only 480 lines are used. The [[digital television|digitally transmitted]] horizontal resolution is usually 720 samples (which includes 16 samples for the horizontal sync and horizontal blanking) or 704 visible [[pixel]]s with an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 4:3 (with vertically rectangular pixels) and therefore a display resolution of 640 × 480 ([[VGA]]); that is [[standard-definition television]] (SDTV) with a 4:3 aspect ratio (with square pixels).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpsoft2000.com/information/hdtv.htm |title=rpsoft 2000 software|work=rpsoft2000.com|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/terms/480i.cfm |title=480i|work=afterdawn.com|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6029_7-6300992-1.html?tag=txt Glossary - 480i]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/480i|title=480i|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[field rate]] (not the [[frame rate]]) is usually (60/1.001) = 59.94 [[Hertz]] for color [[Television|TV]] and can be rounded up to 60 Hz. There are several conventions for written shorthands for the combination of resolution and rate: '''480i60''', '''480i/30''' ([[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]/SMPTE always use frame rate to specify interlaced formats) and '''480/60i'''. 480i is usually used in countries that conventionally use NTSC (most of the Americas and [[Japan]]), because the 525 transmitted lines at 60 hertz of analogue NTSC contain 480 visible ones.

480i can be transported by all major [[digital television]] formats, [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]], [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] and [[ISDB]], and on [[DVD]].

'''Amahuaca''' is an indigenous American Panoan-family language spoken by several dozen people in the [[Amazon Basin]] in [[Perú]] but up to 130 and also in [[Brazil]] by 220 people. It is also known as Amawaka, Amaguaco, Ameuhaque, Ipitineri, and Sayaco. The most closely related languages are [[Cashinahua language|Cashinahua]] and [[Shipibo language|Shipibo]]. It is an official language. There are 20 monolinguals. 30% are literate and 50% are literate in Spanish. Amahuaca uses a Latin-based script. Schools are bilingual, but the language has a negative connotation. A dictionary has been developed along with grammar rules and bible portions.

'''Anatoly Naumovich Rybakov''' ({{lang-ru|Анато́лий Нау́мович Рыбако́в}}; {{OldStyleDate|14 January|1911|1 January}} &amp;ndash; 23 December 1998) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Russian writers|Russian writer]], the author of the anti-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] ''[[Children of the Arbat]] ''tetralogy, the novel ''Heavy Sand'', and many popular children books including ''Adventures of Krosh'', ''Dirk'' and ''Bronze Bird''. One of the last of his works was his memoir ''The Novel of Memoirs'' (Роман-Воспоминание) telling about all the different people (from [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]], to [[Bulat Okudzhava|Okudzhava]] and [[Vladimir Tendryakov|Tendryakov]]) he met during his long life. Writer [[Maria Rybakova]] is his granddaughter.

==Biography==

Rybakov was born in the city of Chernigov, [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Chernihiv]], [[Ukraine]]) in a [[Jew]]ish family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazines.russ.ru/druzhba/1999/3/rybak.html Interview with Rybakov] (in Russian) – an article in ''Druzhba Narodov'' literary magazine, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 he was arrested by the [[NKVD]] and exiled to [[Siberia]] for three years. After the end of his exile, he worked as a transport worker. During [[World War II]], he was a tank commander.

In 1948, he wrote the popular children's book ''Dirk'' (''Кортик''). In 1950, he published the novel ''Drivers'' (''Водители''), then in 1979, the novel ''[[Heavy Sand]]'' (''Тяжёлый Песок'') about the fate of a [[Jew]]ish family under [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation.

''Heavy Sand'' is an epic story of four generations of a Jewish family living in Communist Russia and its life in a [[ghetto]] during the Nazi occupation, culminating in their participation in a ghetto uprising. Though the story of the ghetto uprising is fictional, some details of it seem to be based on the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising|uprising in the Warsaw ghetto]]. It is believed that the novel is based on numerous stories collected by Rybakov from people who survived Nazi occupation of Ukraine. This story was dubbed the "first Russian Holocaust novel" by one of the Western newspapers of the time. The book became a television series in 2008.

His most popular novel, ''[[Children of the Arbat]]'', was written and distributed via [[samizdat]] in the 1960s, but was not published until 1987 despite having been officially announced for publication in 1966 and 1978 (in both cases publication was canceled at the very last moment by the Soviet government).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Neil Cornwell|title=Reference Guide to Russian Literature|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=uXxEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA703&amp;lpg=PA703&amp;dq=Children+of+the+Arbat+Rybakov&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zWcr-UI-qj&amp;sig=Ry1RQ2AQHKgF02BCaUPaikS_4sM&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi31LfxvLDRAhUBtxoKHdrVB2w4HhDoAQg1MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Children%20of%20the%20Arbat%20Rybakov&amp;f=false|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-26070-6|page=703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual publication of the novel and its sequels &amp;ndash; ''1935 and Other Years'' (''Тридцать пятый и другие годы'', 1989), ''Fear'' (''Страх'', 1990) and ''Dust &amp; Ashes'' (''Прах и пепел'', 1994) &amp;ndash; were considered a landmark of the nascent [[glasnost]], as the first in the trilogy was one of the earliest publications of previously forbidden anti-Stalin literature.

Rybakov was a laureate of the [[USSR]] and [[RSFSR]] state awards. He was awarded the [[Stalin Prize]] in 1948 and 1951. He received an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Tel Aviv University]].

Almost all his books have been made into movies. Rybakov’s books have been published in 52 countries, with overall distribution exceeding 20 million copies.

[[Marina Goldovskaya]], a Russian-born documentary filmmaker, forged a deep friendship with Rybakov after meeting him at the French Consulate in Moscow. Goldovskaya filmed Rybakov for over a decade; In 2006, seven years after his death, she released her film, a documentary titled ''[[Anatoliy Rybakov: The Russian Story]]'' (''Анатолий Рыбаков: Послесловие'').

She wrote the young adult novel ''[[The Hate U Give]]'' and is set to release her second novel, ''On the Come Up'' in 2019. Although fiction, the goal of Thomas' work is to shine a light on the issues that many African-Americans in the United States face and to shed more light on the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.

While Angie Thomas was a college student, she heard about the [[shooting of Oscar Grant]] in the news.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; This story, combined with the stories of Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Mike Brown, and Sandra Bland were major influences on her novel ''The Hate U Give.''&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Before ''The Hate U Give'', Thomas had been writing in the fantasy genre but worried that her stories would not matter.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; She spoke with one of her college professors, who suggested that her experiences were unique and that her writing could give voices to those in her world who had been silenced and whose stories had not been told.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In an [[NPR]] interview, Thomas cited [[Tupac Shakur]] as inspiration.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/02/26/517305270/the-hate-u-give-explores-racism-and-police-violence|title='The Hate U Give' Explores Racism And Police Violence|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that she felt a wide range of emotions when listening to his albums, and wanted to achieve a similar effect as a writer: "I want to make you think at times; I want to make you laugh at times; I want to make you cry at times - so he was an influence in that way."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The acronym from her book, ''The Hate U Give'', or THUG  was inspired by one of Tupac's tattoo which said THUG LIFE. Thug Life was also an acronym; this acronym stood for "The hate u give little infants fucks everyone." Thomas wanted to incorporate this in her title but she could not use the entire acronym because it was too long and inappropriate for a YA book so she settled for just ''The Hate U Give'', or THUG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://angiethomas.com|title=Angie Thomas|website=angiethomas.com|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas herself has cited experience with rap, her skills as a teen rapper having been the subject of an article in the magazine ''[[Right On!]]''.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2017/03/04/the-hate-u-give-angie-thomas-sensational-debut-novel-should-be-required-reading-for-clueless-white-people/|title="The Hate U Give": Angie Thomas’ sensational debut novel should be required reading for clu...|last=Keane|first=Erin|date=2017-03-04|website=Salon|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]],'' Thomas stated that she aims to "show truth and tear down stereotypes" in her writing and goes further to say that it is important for the white community to listen to the grievances of the Black Lives Matter Movement. After its publication, ''The Hate U Give'' was optioned for [[The Hate U Give (film)|a film adaptation]] by [[20th Century Fox|Fox 2000]], in which [[Amandla Stenberg]] is set to star as Starr.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

== ''The Hate U Give'' ==
''The Hate U Give'', originally finished as a short story, debuted at number one on the ''New York Times'' best-seller list for young adult hardcover books within the first week it was released.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ''The Hate U Give'' was written, as Angie Thomas says, to bring light to the rather controversial issue of police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In summary, this book tells the story of a girl named Starr Carter and how her life is impacted by the death of her friend, Khalil, who was an unarmed black teen shot at the hands of a police officer. ''The Hate U Give'' deals with the effect of police brutality on the communities of those around the victim.

In 2018, the [[Katy Independent School District]] in [[Katy, Texas]] removed the book from its shelves after complaints over profanity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2017/12/01/the-hate-give-book-banned-texas-school-district/8C2XDJ2rGSK2jjwyajmKJK/story.html|title=‘The Hate U Give’ YA book banned in Texas school district - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[South Carolina]] police union requested the book's removal from a school's summer reading list, because of what the union considered an "indoctrination of distrust of police".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Flood |first1=Alison |title=South Carolina police object to high-school reading list |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/03/south-carolina-police-object-to-high-school-reading-list |accessdate=3 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=3 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julien Auguste Pélage Brizeux''' (12 September 1803 &amp;ndash; 3 May 1858) was a French poet. He was said to belong to a family of [[Ireland|Irish]] origin, long settled in [[Brittany]]. He was educated for the law, but in 1827 he produced at the [[Théâtre Français]] a one-act verse comedy, ''Racine'', in collaboration with [[Philippe Busoni]].

His most important works are, first, ''Marie'' (1832, 1836, 1840), then, ''Les Bretons'' (1845, 1846). He also wrote in the [[Breton language]], notably ''Telenn-Arvor'' and ''Furnez Breiz''.

Brizeux was born at [[Lorient]] ([[Morbihan]].  Though he was brought up with the [[Cornouaille]] dialect of Breton,&lt;ref&gt;Goulven Peron, « Les amis paysans de Brizeux et de La Villemarqué », ''Le Lien'', n° 108, décembre 2008, p. 7-19.&lt;/ref&gt; in his Breton language verse he used the standardised Breton codified by [[Jean-François Le Gonidec]].  He became an ardent student of the [[philology]] and [[archaeology]] of Brittany, and had collected materials for a dictionary of Breton place-names.

A journey to [[Italy]] in company with [[Auguste Barbier]] made a great impression on him, and a second visit (1834) resulted in 1841 in the publication of a complete French translation of Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' in ''[[terza rima]]''. In his collection ''Primel el Nola'' (1852) he included poems written under Italian influence, entitled ''Les Ternaires'' (1841), but in the rustic idyll of ''Marie'' (1836) turned to Breton country life; in ''Les Bretons'' (1845) he found his inspiration in the folklore and legends of his native province. In ''La chasse du Prince Arthur'' he created a narrative around the short life of [[Arthur I, Duke of Brittany]], murdered by [[John of England|King John]] of England. His ''Histoires poétiques'' (1855) was crowned by the French Academy.

Following his death at [[Montpellier]] on 3 May 1858, his ''Œuvres complètes'' (2 vols., 1860) were edited with a notice of the author by [[Saint-René Taillandier]]. Another edition appeared in 1880-1884 (4 vols.). A long list of articles on his work may be consulted in an exhaustive monograph, ''Brizeux; sa vie et ses œuvres'' (1898), by the abbé C. Lecigne.

Known as "le prince des bardes bretons",&lt;ref&gt;D'après ''Les Noms qui ont fait l'histoire de Bretagne'', 1997. En Bretagne, au moins quatorze rues portent son nom.&lt;/ref&gt; he was credited as the founder of modern Breton literature by later Breton Celticists. [[Théodore Botrel]] created a monument to him in [[Pont-Aven]], which is ceremonially adorned each year at the ''Fête des Fleurs d’Ajonc''. His works in Breton, ''Telenn Arvor'' (1844), and his collection of proverbs, ''Furnez Breiz'' (1845), were republished by [[Roparz Hemon]] in the Breton language literary magazine ''[[Gwalarn]]'' in 1929.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5873">== Old translation ==

The Bible was first translated into [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] in the 17th century by [[Wojciech Bobowski]], a Polish convert to [[Islam]] also known as Ali Bey. The New Testament from his manuscript was printed in Paris in 1819, then revised and printed with the Old Testament in 1827. A new translation was published in Istanbul in 1878 and entitled ''Kitab-ı Mukaddes'' ("Holy Book"). Revised several times, this was the only Bible in the Arabic alphabet of Ottoman Turkish that stayed in print until the end of the Ottoman period. In addition, Armeno-Turkish and Graeco-Turkish Bibles were produced in the Turkish spoken by these Ottoman minority peoples and written in their very different alphabets.

== Modern translations ==
Following [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]]'s orthographic reforms in 1928, the Bible was rewritten in the Latin script-based new Turkish alphabet. This project was completed in 1941. However, as the Turkish authorities were determined to remove as many foreign words from Turkish as possible, the language consequently underwent a dramatic transformation. In just sixty years, the language went through the equivalent of three hundred years of changes, thus many foreign words found in the old Turkish Bible were no longer used. Because of this the [[United Bible Society]] and the [http://www.translation-trust.org/ Translation Trust] joined together to produce a translation suited to the new language. This work is a [[colloquial]] version. The translators included [[Ali Şimşek]], [[Behnan Konutgan]] and [[Mahmud Solgun]]. The translation consultants included the [[Rev. Dr. Manuel Jinbachian]] and [[Dr. Krijn van der Jagt]]. In 1989 the New Testament was published, one journalist saying the work "flows like music." The New Testament edition is called ''İNCİL: İncil'in Çağdaş Türkçe Çevirisi''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Turkish-Testament-Incilin-Cagdas-Cevirisi/dp/B007YGQ656&lt;/ref&gt; The complete Bible was dedicated on October 21, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblesociety.org/sr_27/sr27_16.htm UBS Special Report 27, Romania &amp; Turkey - November 2001 #16&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It has the title, ''KUTSAL KİTAP Yeni Çeviri / Eski ve Yeni Antlaşma (Tevrat, Zebur, İncil)''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Turkish-Brownish-Bonded-Leather-Antlasma/dp/B007YQ26QE/&lt;/ref&gt; 

A Turkish translation of the New Testament into simplified language was published in 2012, with the title, ''Halk Dilinde İncil: Sadeleştirilmiş İncil Tercümesi''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://halkdilinde.com/ Halk Dilinde İncil]&lt;/ref&gt; The publication was launched at a reception at the Prestige Elite Hotel in Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://haber.sat7turk.com/halk-dilinde-incil-tanitildi Halk Dilinde İncil Tanıtıldı]/&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher is called Yeni Yaşam Yayınları, which translates in English as New Life Publications.

In 2011, an organization published a Turkish translation of the Gospel of Matthew, which used a [[paraphrase]] methodology. This was part of a wider controversy that arose among several mission agencies during 2012 with regard to how to translate certain words and phrases at the heart of Christian belief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liturgy.co.nz/wycliffe-wades-into-wild-waters/8741 Wycliffe wades into wild waters]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Cosmades]] translated the New Testament into Turkish in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldmag.com/articles/19184 The battle for accurate Bible translation in Asia] Feb 25 2012 "Thomas Cosmades, a Turkish Christian who translated the New Testament into Turkish from the original Greek, mailed a letter to Frontiers at the end of 2007 after he saw a copy of the Turkish Matthew. (Several hundred were printed before the official publication in 2011). Cosmades died in 2010, at age 86, just after he published a new edition of his New Testament. In his letter he wrote that he was "highly disquieted" by the paraphrased Matthew and proceeded to analyze the debatable phrases in detail. "&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] released a translation of the Bible into Turkish, ''Kutsal Kitap Yeni Dünya Çevirisi'', in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jw.org/tr/yay%C4%B1nlar/kutsal-kitap/nwt/kitaplar/ &lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dispersal draft''' is a process in professional sports for assigning players to a new team when their current team ceases to exist or is merged with another team.  Since most [[Draft (sports)|sports draft]]s are held in [[North America]], this is where most dispersal drafts are conducted as well.

Since no [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional sports]] team has folded or merged since 1978, dispersal drafts are more commonly seen in emerging sports (such as [[soccer]] or women's [[basketball]] in the [[United States]]) or alternative leagues where initial support for a team failed to remain consistent and the team was unable to survive financially.

==Examples of dispersal drafts==
*The [[National Football League]] held a [[1950 AAFC Dispersal Draft|dispersal draft]] on June 2, 1950, to allocate players from the four remaining teams in the [[All-America Football Conference]] who would not be joining the NFL.
*The [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] had two dispersal drafts in the 1950&amp;ndash;51 season: In October 1950, a dispersal draft for the [[Chicago Stags]] franchise was conducted, and in January 1951, the [[Washington Capitols]] demise led to a second dispersal draft.
*The [[American Basketball Association]] in 1975 had two drafts within a month of each other in October and November 1975 as two teams folded during what turned out to be the final season of the ABA.
*On August 8, 1976, as part of the ABA-NBA merger agreement, a dispersal draft was conducted to assign teams for the players on the two ABA franchises which had folded.
*In June 1978, the NHL allowed the financially struggling Cleveland Barons and Minnesota North Stars to merge under the North Stars banner. The North Stars were allowed to keep some of the players from each team, and the remaining players went into the [[1978 NHL Dispersal Draft]]. 
*In 1991, the [[National Hockey League]] conducted a [[1991 NHL Dispersal Draft|dispersal draft]] in order to split a new team, the [[San Jose Sharks]], from the [[Minnesota North Stars]] as a compromise after the North Stars owners requested permission to move the financially struggling franchise to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], effectively undoing the 1978 merger.
*In 1996, the [[Canadian Football League]] conducted a dispersal draft which consisted of players from the rosters of the [[Birmingham Barracudas]], [[Memphis Mad Dogs]], [[San Antonio Texans]] and [[Shreveport Pirates]] in order to return the CFL to a nine-team format with all franchises based in Canadian cities. The CFL conducted another dispersal draft the following year, when the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] ceased operations; those players under contract by the team were dispersed amongst the eight remaining teams.
*In 1996 and 1997, the [[Australian Football League]] held an [[expansion draft|expansion and dispersal]] draft as part of the [[1996 AFL Draft|1996 National draft and the 1997 Pre-season draft]] as Port Adelaide would enter the AFL for the 1997 season, and the Brisbane Bears had taken over Fitzroy's playing operations after Fitzroy had folded at the end of Round 22. The Bears were allowed to recruit eight of the 19 Fitzroy players that nominated for the draft as part of the agreement to take the Lions nickname and Fitzroy's remaining AFL property, while three Fitzroy players were taken by Port Adelaide, and the remaining eight players were drafted by other teams. 
*In 2002, [[Major League Soccer]] held a [[2002 MLS Dispersal Draft|dispersal draft]] after shutting down the [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] and [[Miami Fusion]] teams.
*The [[WNBA]] has had five such drafts: For the 2003 season, after Miami and Portland folded; 2004 season, after Cleveland folded; the 2007 season, after Charlotte folded; the 2008 season, after Houston folded; and the 2010 season, after Sacramento folded.  In each draft, all remaining WNBA teams were allowed a draft pick in reverse order of their regular-season record for the preceding season.
*The [[Major Indoor Soccer League (2001 – 2008)|Major Indoor Soccer League]] shut down the [[San Diego Sockers (2001-2004)|San Diego Sockers]] and [[Monterrey Fury]] in December 2004 as a result of various issues, including unpaid debts and insolvency. Players in those teams were then distributed to the remaining teams in a dispersal draft, and the order of player selection was in reverse order of the winning percentage of the remaining teams (excluding games against San Diego and Monterrey and the playoffs) from the 2003-04 seasons and the 2004-2005 season up to that point.
*On April 9, 2006, the [[Ottawa Renegades]] had their team operations suspended by the [[Canadian Football League]]. On April 12, 2006, the former players still under contract and those that the Renegades had the rights to, were [[CFL Dispersal Draft|distributed]] amongst the remaining eight teams. [[Quarterback]] [[Kerry Joseph]] was selected #1 overall by the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] after they traded with the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] for the rights to the #1 pick.
*On January 5, 2007, the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]] conducted a one-round seven team dispersal draft after the SPHL terminated the Florida Seals franchise midway through the season; the seven players who were drafted went to their new teams, while the remaining players became free agents.
*The [[United Football League (2009&amp;ndash;)|United Football League]] conducted a dispersal draft prior to the [[2011 UFL season|2011 season]] to accommodate the shutdown of the [[Hartford Colonials]]. Five rounds were held among the UFL's four remaining teams, the twenty players who were drafted went to their new teams, and the remaining players became free agents.
*On September 6, 2013, the [[Arena Football League]] held a dispersal draft to distribute the players of the dormant [[Chicago Rush]] and [[Utah Blaze]] franchises. They referred to the dispersal draft as the "Offseason Assignment Process".
* On November 19, 2014, [[Major League Soccer]] held the [[2014 MLS Dispersal Draft]] to distribute the players of [[Chivas USA]].

[[File:Cabin dubbing.jpg|thumb|Dubbing studio]]
'''Dubbing''', '''mixing''' or '''re-recording''', is a [[post-production]] process used in [[filmmaking]] and [[video production]] in which additional or supplementary recordings are "mixed" with original production sound to create the finished soundtrack.

The process usually takes place on a dub stage. After sound editors edit and prepare all the necessary tracks – dialogue, automated dialogue replacement (ADR), effects, [[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley]], music – the dubbing mixers proceed to balance all of the elements and record the finished soundtrack. Dubbing is sometimes confused with ADR, also known as "additional dialogue replacement",&lt;ref name="plexoft.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plexoft.com/SBF/A03.html#AccidDR |title=SBF Glossary: AD to adzy |accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fia-actors.com/uploads/Equity%20PACTCinema2003.pdf |title=p. 48 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aes.org/par/a/#ADPCM |title=Pro Audio Reference A |accessdate=2017-12-17 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "automated dialogue recording" and "looping",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.routledge.com/cw/butler-9780415883283/s1/glossary/ |title=Glossary - Television |accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is ADR?|url=http://www.filmmaking.net/faq/answers/faq154.asp?catid=10 |publisher=filmmaking.net |accessdate=27 December 2013 |first=Benjamin |last=Craig |date=21 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the original [[actor]]s re-record and synchronize audio segments.

Outside the film industry, the term "dubbing" commonly refers to the replacement of the actor's voices with those of different performers speaking another language, which is called "revoicing" in the film industry.&lt;ref name="plexoft.com"/&gt;

==Origins==
In the past, dubbing was practiced primarily in [[Musical theatre|musicals]] when the actor had an unsatisfactory singing voice. Today, dubbing enables the screening of [[audiovisual]] material to a mass audience in countries where viewers do not speak the same language as the performers in the original production.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Films, [[video]]s, and sometimes [[video game]]s are often dubbed into the local [[language]] of a foreign market. In foreign distribution, dubbing is common in theatrically released films, [[television films]], [[television series]], [[cartoon]]s, and [[anime]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Methods==
&lt;!-- EDITOR NOTE: The article "Automated dialogue replacement" redirects to this subhead. If the subhead is changed, fix the redirect, too. --&gt;

===ADR/post-sync===
'''Automated Dialog Replacement''' ('''ADR''') is the process of re-recording dialogue by the original actor after the filming process to improve audio quality or reflect dialogue changes (also known as "looping" or a "looping session").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ADR: Hollywood Dialogue Recording Secrets |url=http://magazine.creativecow.net/article/adr-hollywood-dialogue-recording-secrets|work=Creative COW Magazine|publisher=Creative COW|accessdate=30 July 2012|author=Cowdog|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Dark Knight Without Heath Ledger: How will Warner Bros. sell a summer blockbuster marked by tragedy?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/hollywoodland/2008/01/the_dark_knight_without_heath_ledger.html |work=Slate |publisher=The Slate Group, LLC |accessdate=30 July 2012 |first=Kim |last=Masters |date=31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]] the process is simply known as "dubbing", while in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is also called "post-synchronisation" or "post-sync". The insertion of [[voice acting|voice actor]] performances for [[animation]], such as [[computer generated imagery]] or [[animated cartoon]]s, is often referred to as ADR although it generally does not replace existing dialogue.

The ADR process may be used to: 
:*remove extraneous sounds such as production equipment noise, traffic, wind, or other undesirable sounds from the environment;
:*change the original lines recorded on set to clarify context; 
:*improve [[diction]] or correct an [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]; 
:*improve [[Timing (comedy)|comedic timing]] or dramatic timing; 
:*correct technical issues with [[synchronization]]; 
:*use a studio-quality singing performance or provide a voice-double for actors who are poor vocalists;
:*add or remove content for legal purposes (such as removing an unauthorized trademarked name);
:*add or remove a product placement;
:*correct a misspoken line not caught during filming.
:*replace foul language for TV broadcasts of the movie.
In conventional film production, a [[production sound mixer]] records dialogue during filming. During post-production, a supervising [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]], or ADR supervisor, reviews all of the dialogue in the film and decides which lines must be re-recorded. ADR is recorded during an ADR session, which takes place in a specialized [[Recording studio|sound studio]]. The actor, usually the original actor from the set, views the scene with the original sound, then attempts to recreate the performance. Over the course of multiple [[take]]s, the actor performs the lines while watching the scene; the most suitable take becomes the final version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ADR |publisher=FilmSound.org |url=http://filmsound.org/terminology/adr.htm |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ADR process does not always take place in a post-production studio. The process may be recorded on location, with mobile equipment. ADR can also be recorded without showing the actor the image they must match, but by having them listen to the performance, since some actors believe that watching themselves act can degrade subsequent performances.

Sometimes, a different actor than the original actor on set is used during ADR. One famous example is the ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Darth Vader]] portrayed by [[David Prowse]]; in post-production, [[James Earl Jones]] dubbed the voice of Vader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title=Film: Lucas Returns with 'The Jedi' |date=25 May 1983 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9c00e3d71e38f936a15756c0a965948260 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include:
*[[Ray Park]], who acted as [[Darth Maul]] from ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'' had his voice dubbed over by [[Peter Serafinowicz]]
*Frenchmen [[Philippe Noiret]] and [[Jacques Perrin]], who were dubbed into Italian for ''[[Cinema Paradiso]]''
*Austrian bodybuilder [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], dubbed for ''[[Hercules in New York]]''
*Argentine boxer [[Carlos Monzón]], dubbed by a professional actor for the lead in the drama ''[[La Mary]]''
*[[Gert Frobe]], who played Auric Goldfinger in the James Bond film [[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]], dubbed by Michael Collins
*[[Andie MacDowell]]'s Jane, in ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'', who was dubbed by [[Glenn Close]]
*[[Tom Hardy]], who portrayed [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', re-dubbed half of his own lines for ease of viewer comprehension
*[[Harvey Keitel]] was dubbed by [[Roy Dotrice]] in post production for ''[[Saturn 3]]
*[[Dave Coulier]] dubbed replacement of swear words for [[Richard Pryor]] in multiple TV versions of his movies

===Rythmo band===
An alternative method to dubbing, called "rythmo band" (or "[[Lip sync|lip-sync]] band"), has historically been used in [[Canada]] and [[France]]. It provides a more precise guide for the actors, [[Film director|directors]], and technicians, and can be used to complement the traditional ADR method. The "band" is actually a clear 35&amp;nbsp;mm [[film leader]] on which the dialogue is hand-written in [[India ink]], together with numerous additional indications for the actor—including laughs, cries, length of syllables, mouth sounds, breaths, and mouth openings and closings. The rythmo band is projected in the studio and scrolls in perfect synchronization with the picture.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Studio time is used more efficiently, since with the aid of scrolling text, picture, and audio cues, actors can read more lines per hour than with ADR alone (only picture and audio). With ADR, actors can average 10–12 lines per hour, while rythmo band can facilitate the reading of 35-50 lines per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U of U Sound Final |url=http://quizlet.com/8640541/u-of-u-sound-final-flash-cards/ |work=Quizlet |publisher=Quizlet LLC |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Quizlet |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the preparation of a rythmo band is a time-consuming process involving a series of specialists organized in a production line. This has prevented the technique from being more widely adopted, but software emulations of rythmo band technology overcome the disadvantages of the traditional rythmo band process and significantly reduce the time needed to prepare a dubbing session.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Cloud-based dubbing===
With the advance of cloud technology, dubbing artists are now able to capture their lines using cloud software in any suitable recording environment and are no longer required to complete recordings in a physical studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/tech/a-game-changer-for-dubbing/5132588.article|title=A game changer for dubbing|last=|first=|date=|work=Broadcast|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Global use==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Dubbing is often used to [[language localization|localize]] a foreign movie. The new voice track is usually spoken by a [[voice artist]], or voice actor. In many countries, actors who regularly perform this duty remain little-known, with the exception of particular circles (such as anime [[fandom]]) or when their voices have become synonymous with roles or actors whose voices they usually dub. In the United States, many of these voice artists may employ pseudonyms or go uncredited due to [[Screen Actors Guild]] regulations or the desire to dissociate themselves from the role.

Especially in comedies and animated movies, famous local actors may be hired to perform the dubbing, as their names are intended to attract a local audience; the entire cast may be dubbed by a local cast of similar familiarity.

===Dub localization===
Dub localization, also often simply referred to as [[Language localization|localization]], is a form of a [[voice-over]].  It is the practice of [[voice-over translation]] altering a [[foreign language]] [[film]], [[art film]] or [[television series]] by [[voice actor]]s.

Dub localization is a hot button issue active in [[cinephilia]] amongst aficionados of foreign [[filmmaking]] and [[television program]]s, particularly [[anime]] fans as [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] are still a popular form of translation of animated series. While some localization is virtually inevitable in translation, the controversy surrounding how much localization is "too much" is often much-discussed in such communities, especially when the final dub product is significantly different from the original. Some frown on any extensive localization, while others expect it and, to a degree, appreciate it.

Some dub localizations are considered so extreme as to have produced a different show or film entirely.

===Europe===
[[File:Dubbing films in Europe.png|thumb|300px|{{legend|#0000FF|Dubbing only for children: Otherwise solely subtitles.}}
{{legend|#FF0000|General dubbing: Countries using exclusively a full-cast dubbing.}}
{{legend|#FFFF00|Voice-over: Countries using a couple or just one voice actor, whereas the original soundtrack persists. Movies and TV shows intended for children are generally dubbed, with a full-cast dubbing as well.}}
{{legend|#FF9900|Mixed areas: Countries using occasionally a full-cast dubbing, otherwise subtitles or voice-over.}}

{{legend|#7F3E98|Slovakia and Belarus: Countries with a separate official language that occasionally produce own dubbings, but generally using dubbing versions of other countries, since their languages are very similar to each other in pronunciation, and the audience is also able to understand it without any problems.}}]]

====Kids/Family films and programming====
In [[North-West Europe]] (the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], the Dutch-speaking part of [[Belgium]] and the [[Nordic countries]]), [[Portugal]] and [[Balkans|Balkan countries]], generally only movies and TV shows intended for children are dubbed, while TV shows and movies for older audiences are subtitled (although animated productions have a tradition of being dubbed). For movies in cinemas with clear target audiences (both below and above 10–11 years of age), both a dubbed and a subtitled version are usually available.

=====United Kingdom=====
In the [[United Kingdom]], the vast majority of foreign language films are subtitled, although mostly animated films and TV programmes are dubbed in English. These usually originate from [[North America]], as opposed to being dubbed locally. There have, however, been notable examples of films and TV programmes successfully dubbed in the UK, such as the Japanese ''[[Monkey (TV series)|Monkey]]'' and French ''[[The Magic Roundabout|Magic Roundabout]]'' series. When airing films on television, channels in the UK often choose subtitling over dubbing, even if a dubbing in English exists. It is also a fairly common practice for animation aimed at [[Preschool education|preschool]] children to be re-dubbed with British voice actors replacing the original voices, such as Spin Master Entertainment's [[PAW Patrol|Paw Patrol]] series, although this is not done with shows aimed at older audiences.

Some animated films and TV programmes are also dubbed into [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]].

=====Ireland=====
Ireland usually receives the same film versions as the UK. However some films have been dubbed into [[Irish language|Irish]] by [[TG4]], including the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bY4JK5PR4MAC&amp;lpg=PA275&amp;ots=D6dkX7Up-y&amp;dq=Harry%20Potter%20TG4&amp;pg=PA275#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''Writing and Translating for Children''], Elena Di Giovanni, Chiara Elefante, Roberta Pederzoli, Peter Lang, 2010, page 259&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Romania=====
&lt;!-- Please do not change this section to Hungarian, because graph QA11 of the Eurobarometer lists the number 62 next to RO (Romania). Hungary is HU.--&gt;
In [[Romania]], virtually all programmes intended for children are dubbed in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], including cartoons, live-action movies and TV series on [[Disney Channel Romania|Disney Channel]], [[Cartoon Network (Europe)|Cartoon Network]], [[Minimax tv|Minimax]], and [[Nickelodeon]], as well as those shown on general television networks, children-focused series (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[The New Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Planet's Funniest Animals]]'') or movies screened on children's television. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Romanian dubbing. However, those cinemas with more screening rooms usually also provide the original subtitled version. Such was the case for movies like ''[[Babe (movie)|Babe]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Cars (movie)|Cars]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''. Other foreign TV shows and movies are shown in the original language with Romanian subtitles. Subtitles are usually preferred in the Romanian market. According to "Special Eurobarometer 243" (graph QA11.8) of the [[European Commission]] (research carried out in November and December 2005), 62% of Romanians prefer to watch foreign films and programmes with subtitles (rather than dubbed), 22% prefer dubbing, and 16% declined to answer.&lt;ref name="eurobarometer"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 243] of the European Commission with the title "Europeans and their Languages", published in February 2006 with research carried out in November and December 2005. Barely 2% of Romanians consider watching original-language versions most effective into learning a new language (Table QA7b).&lt;/ref&gt; This is led by the assumption that watching movies in their original versions is very useful for learning foreign languages. However, according to the same Eurobarometer, virtually no Romanian found this method—watching movies in their original version—to be the most efficient way to learn foreign languages, compared to 53 percent who preferred language lessons at school.&lt;ref name="eurobarometer" /&gt;

In Romania, foreign language television programs and films are generally subtitled rather than dubbed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=csMetRFKXmgC&amp;lpg=PT61&amp;dq=romania%20dubbing%20tv&amp;pg=PT61#v=onepage&amp;q=romania%20dubbing%20tv&amp;f=true ''Dracula is Dead: How Romanians Survived Communism, Ended It, and Emerged Since 1989 as the New Italy''], Sheilah Kast, Jim Rosapepe, 2009, page 49&lt;/ref&gt; This includes programs in non-Western languages, such as [[Korean language|Korean]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aXutBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=romania+subtitles+television&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI-s2aysvOAhXrAMAKHXs4Ca4Q6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=romania%20subtitles%20television&amp;f=true ''The Global Impact of South Korean Popular Culture: Hallyu Unbound''], Valentina Marinescu, Lexington Books, 2014, page 91&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Serbia=====
[[Serbian language]] dubs are made mainly for [[Serbia]], but they broadcast in [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina]], too. Children's animated and some live-action movies and TV series are dubbed into Serbian, while live-action films and TV series for adults are always airing subtitled, because in this region people prefer subtitling for live-action formats. [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap opera ''[[Lale Devri]]'' started airing dubbed in 2011, on [[RTV Pink]], but because of bad recepcion, dub failed and rest of TV series was aired subtitled. ''[[Married... with Children]]'' was dubbed, too.

The dubbing of cartoon series in former [[Yugoslavia]] during the 1980s had a twist of its own: famous [[Serbia]]n actors, such as [[Nikola Simić (actor)|Nikola Simić]], [[Mića Tatić]], [[Nada Blam]] and others provided the voices for characters of [[Disney]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and other companies, frequently using region-specific phrases and sentences and, thus, adding a dose of local humor to the translation of the original lines. These phrases became immensely popular and are still being used for [[tongue-in-cheek]] comments in specific situations. These dubs are today considered cult dubs. The only dub made after 1980s and 1990s ones that's considered cult is ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' dub, made by [[B92]] in period 2002-2017, because of a great popularity and memorable translation with local humor phrases, such as 1980s dubs translation.

Some of the Serbian dubs are also broadcast in [[Republic of Macedonia]], while cult dubs made during [[Yugoslavia]], where aired all over the country (today [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Slovenia]], [[Republic of Macedonia]] and [[Serbia]]).

=====Croatia=====
In [[Croatia]], foreign films and TV series are always subtitled, while most children's programs and animated movies are dubbed into [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The practice of dubbing began in the 1980s in some animated shows and continued in 90's, 00's and forward in other shows and films, the latter ones being released in home media. Recently, more efforts have been made to introduce dubbing, but public reception has been poor in some exceptions. Regardless of language, Croatian audiences prefer subtitling to dubbing, however it is still popular in animated films. Some previously popular shows (such as ''[[Sailor Moon]]'') lost their appeal completely after the practice of dubbing began, and the dubbing was eventually removed from the programs, even though most animated shows shown on television and some on home media have been well received by people watching them with own dub. This situation is similar with theater movies, with only those intended for children being dubbed (such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and ''[[Shark Tale]]''), but nowadays are shown in dubbed versions. Also, there has been an effort to impose dubbing by [[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]], with ''[[La Fea Más Bella]]'' translated as ''Ružna ljepotica'' (literally, "The Ugly Beauty"), a Mexican telenovela, but it failed. Some of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubbing is also broadcast in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

=====Slovenia=====
In [[Slovenia]], all foreign films and television programs are subtitled with the exception of children's movies and TV shows (both animated or live-action). While dubbed versions are always shown in cinemas and later on TV channels, cinemas will sometimes play subtitled versions of children's movies as well.

=====Republic of Macedonia=====
[[Republic of Macedonia]] dubbed many cartoons in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], but they also air some [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs. Children's programs are airing dubbed (in Macedonian or Serbian), while every other program is subtitled (in Macedonian). They use [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs for [[Disney]] movies, because there's no [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] [[Disney]] dubs.

=====Bosnia and Herzegovina=====
[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] usually uses [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubs, but they've dubbed some cartoons in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] by themselves, for example ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]]''. Children's programs (both animated and live-action) are airing dubbed (in Serbian, Croatian or Bosnian), while every other program is subtitled (in Bosnian).

=====Belgium=====
In the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium ([[Flanders]]), movies and TV series are shown in their original language with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], with the exception of most movies made for a young audience. In the latter case, sometimes separate versions are recorded in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Flanders]] (for instance, several [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Walt Disney films]] and [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]]). These dubbed versions only differ from each other in their use of different voice actors and different pronunciation, while the text is almost the same.

In the French-speaking part of Belgium ([[Wallonia]]), the range of French-dubbed versions is approximately as wide as the [[German language|German]] range, where nearly all movies and TV series are dubbed.

=====Portugal=====
In [[Portugal]], dubbing was banned under a 1948 law as a way of protecting the domestic film industry and reduce the access to culture as most of the population was illiterate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |title=amor de perdição - especiais |date=21 January 2005 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050121055806/http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |archivedate=21 January 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1994, animated movies, as well as other TV series for children shown in Portugal, have imported [[Brazilian Portuguese]] dubs due to the lack of interest from Portuguese companies in the dubbing industry. This lack of interest was justified, since there were already quality dubbed copies of shows and movies in Portuguese made by [[Brazil]]ians. ''[[The Lion King]]'' was the first feature film to be dubbed in [[European Portuguese]] rather than strictly Brazilian Portuguese. Currently, all movies for children are dubbed in European Portuguese. Subtitles are preferred in Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://www.jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/polemica-dobragem-serie-einstein-gera-criticas-axn-118969|título=Polémica: dobragem da série ‘Einstein’ gera críticas ao AXN|acessodata=29 de março de 2017|data=3 de fevereiro de 2017|obra=O Jornal Económico|quote=Ao contrário de alguns mercados como o espanhol e brasileiro, o público português não se mostra recetivo a esta opção.|language=portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; used in every foreign-language [[Documentary film|documentary]], TV series and film. The exception to this preference is when children are the target audience.

While on TV, children's shows and movies are always dubbed, in cinemas, films with a clear juvenile target can be found in two versions, one dubbed (identified by the letters V.P. for ''versão portuguesa'' - "Portuguese version") and another subtitled version (V.O. for ''versão original'' - "original version"). This duality applies only to juvenile films. Others use subtitles only. While the quality of these dubs is recognized (some have already received international recognition and prizes), original versions with subtitles are usually preferred by the adults (''[[Bee Movie]]'', for example). Dubbing cartoons aimed at adults (such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' or ''[[South Park]]'') is less common. When ''The Simpsons Movie'' debuted in Portugal, most cinemas showed both versions (V.O. and V.P.), but in some small cities, cinemas decided to offer only the Portuguese version, a decision that led to public protest. Presently, [[live action]] series and movies are always shown in their original language format with Portuguese subtitles. Television programs for young children (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[Big Bad Beetleborgs]]'', etc.) are dubbed into European Portuguese. Some video games aimed at adults (such as [[God of War III]], [[Halo 3]], [[Assassin's Creed III]] and [[inFamous 2]]) are dubbed in European Portuguese, although there they provide an option to select the original language.

=====Netherlands=====
In the Netherlands, for the most part, Dutch versions are only made for children's and family films. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Dutch dubbing, but usually those cinemas with more screening rooms also provide the original subtitled version, such as movies like ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''.

=====Greece=====
In [[Greece]], most cartoon films have dubs. Usually when a movie has a Greek dub the dub is shown in cinemas but subtitled versions are shown as well. Foreign TV shows for adults are shown in their original versions with subtitles, most cartoons, for example, ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[The Jetsons]]'' were always dubbed, while ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'' are always subtitled and contain the original English dialogue, since they are mostly for adults rather than children, (even though the movie ''[[Space Jam]]'' was subtitled instead of being dubbed, since also this is suitable for children). Also some Japanese anime series are dubbed in Greek (such as Pokémon, Pichi Pichi Pitch, Sailor Moon etc.) The only television programs dubbed in Greek includes [[Mexico|Mexican]] TV series (like ''[[Rubí (2004 telenovela)|Rubí]]'' and ''[[La usurpadora]]'') and teen series (like ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody]]''). However, when [[Skai TV]] was re-launched in April 2006, the network opted for dubbing almost all foreign shows in Greek, unlike other Greek channels which had always broadcast most of the programs in their original language with subtitles.

=====Nordic countries=====
In the [[Nordic countries]], dubbing is used only in animated features and other films for younger audiences. Some cinemas in the major cities may also screen the original version, usually as the last showing of the day, or in a smaller auditorium in a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]].

In television programs with off-screen narration, the original audio is dubbed in their native language, while on-screen voices are usually subtitled.

The Nordic countries are often treated as a common market issuing [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases with original audio and user choosable subtitle options in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The covers often have text in all four languages as well, but are sometimes unique for each country. Some releases may include other European language audio and/or subtitles (i.e. German, Greek, Hungarian or Italian). Children's films typically have Nordic audio tracks in all four languages, as well as original audio in most cases.

In [[Finland]], the dubbed version from [[Sweden]] may also be available at certain cinemas for children of the 5% Swedish-speaking minority, but only in cities or towns with a significant percentage of Swedish speakers. Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually only have the original audio, except for children's films, which have both Finnish and Swedish language tracks, in addition to the original audio and subtitles in both languages.

In [[Iceland]], the dubbed version of film and TV is usually [[Danish language|Danish]] with some translated into [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[LazyTown]], an Icelandic TV show originally broadcast in English, was dubbed into Icelandic, amongst thirty-two other languages, and it remains the TV show to have been dubbed into the most languages.

In movie theaters, films for adult audiences have both Finnish and Swedish subtitles, the Finnish printed in basic font and the Swedish printed below the Finnish in a cursive font. In the early ages of television, foreign TV shows and movies were voiced by narrator in Finland. Later, subtitles became a practice on Finnish television. Dubbing of films other than children's films is unpopular in Finland, as in many other countries. A good example is ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''. While the original version was well-received, the Finnish-dubbed version received poor reviews, with some critics even calling it a disaster.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} On the other hand, many dubs of [[Disney]] animated features have been well-received, both critically and by the public.

=====Estonia=====
In [[Estonia]] in cinemas, only children's animated films are dubbed and live-action films are shown in the original language with subtitles at cinemas. Subtitles are usually presented in both Estonian and [[Russian language]]s. Cartoons and animated series voiced by dubbing or voiceover and live-action films and television series only with Estonian subtitles. Animated films are commonly shown in both the original language and dubbed into Estonian (or Russian in many cinemas). Most Estonian-language television channels use subtitles for foreign-language films and TV channels. However, Russian language channels tend to use dubbing more often, especially for Russian channels broadcast from [[Russia]] (as opposed to Russian channels broadcast from Estonia).

====General films and programming====
In the [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] language-speaking markets of [[Europe]], almost all foreign films and television shows are dubbed (the exception being the majority of theatrical releases of adult-audience movies in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]] and [[Turkey]] and high-profile videos in Russia). There are few opportunities to watch foreign movies in their original versions. In [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], even in the largest cities, there are few cinemas that screen original versions with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], or without any translation. However, digital [[pay-TV]] programming is often available in the original language, including the latest movies. Prior to the rise of DVDs, which in these countries are mostly issued with multi-language audio tracks, original-language films (those in languages other than the country's official language) were rare, whether in theaters, on TV, or on home video, and subtitled versions were considered a product for small [[niche market]]s such as intellectual or [[art film]]s.

=====Latvia and Lithuania=====
In [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], only children's movies get dubbed in the cinema, while many movies use voice-over. In recent years however, many cartoons have been dubbed into Latvian and Lithuanian for TV. But some other kids shows, like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', use the voice-over.

=====Albania=====
The first movie dubbed in [[Albanian language]] was ''[[The Great Warrior Skanderbeg]]'' in 1954 and since then, there have been thousands of popular titles dubbed in Albanian by different dubbing studios. All animated movies and children's programs are dubbed into Albanian language, many live-action movies as well. TV series nevertheless are usually not dubbed, they are subtitled except for a few [[Mexico|Mexican]], [[Brazil]]ian and [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap operas, like: ''[[Por ti (telenovela)|Por Ti]]'', ''[[Celebridade]]'', ''[[A Casa das Sete Mulheres]]'', ''[[Paramparça (TV series)|Paramparça]]'', etc. As for documentaries, Albania usually uses voice-over.

Voice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in Albanian language can be enlisted here.

=====France=====
In [[France]], movies and TV series are, except purely arthouse films, usually released in the dubbed French language version. The original language version of the film with French subtitles is released in designated theaters which show only subtitled versions or both versions are shown at different times or split screenings between both versions. However, dubbing is the norm and subtitling is only for niche audience and movies with subtitles are usually very small arthouse films with very limited commercial prospects for pay and free TV airings and also home entertainment (VOD, DVD,). Dubbing in the French Language is thus absolutely essential for any sale to be made.

Since the digitalization of even now the over-the -air television broadcaster, both versions are however offered to the customer simultaneously.
By default, foreign films and TV programmes shown on television are dubbed into French on a channel's main audio feed. However, with the advent of digital television, viewers can access the original language feed for some programmes, as well as matching subtitles. 
Most movies are released nationwide in dubbed version and subtitled versions where available with the exception of very limited often micro-budget arthouse productions that do stem come from the "hollywood movie production" machine which are exclusively arthouse films and not dubbed at the time of their theatrical release.
Theaters showing these kind of movies or also showing commercial films in the original language version with French subtitles are very rare outside of the big cities and most of them are located in [[Paris]] which has the most "cinephile" cinemas in France. Often these "niche" films are only released in [[Paris]] region.

A theater showing subtitled versions of original language movies are typically well known for this and will advertise this also on the poster advising moviegoers that the film is shown in an original language version (usually abbreviated VO [''version originale''] or VOST [''version originale sous-titrée'']), as opposed to VF [''version française''], the latter then becoming what is known and used also in the neighboring countries like Belgium or Switzerland, as the "FRENCH LANGUAGE VERSION" of the film.)

Because the alterations made to the original film are so profound, making it no longer viewable or understandable for audiences that speak the language the film was originally shot in, the final dubbed version is called the "French language version", as opposed to the use of subtitles which leave the film in its original state.
The choice to dub or not at the time of theatrical release is a decision made by the distributor releasing the film based upon their recoupment strategy for the film and their prognosis of the commercial prospects. Given the fact that a dub is needed for home entertainment and TV sales, only very small arthouse films are never dubbed.
Only a very small percentage (according to the official institute CNC in France only 16.4% of all ticket-sales where for movies watched in the original language version with subtitles) and this is counting Blockbusters and others shown in their original language version with subtitles and the small number of films that are never dubbed.

=====Italy=====
In [[Italy]], dubbing is systematic, with a tradition going back to the 1930s in [[Rome]], [[Milan]], [[Florence]] and [[Turin]]. In [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] fascist Italy, release of foreign languages movies was banned for political reasons. Rome is the principal base of the dubbing industry, where major productions such as movies, drama, documentaries and some cartoons are dubbed. However, dubbing in Milan is mostly of cartoons and some minor productions. Practically every foreign film (mostly American ones) of every genre, for children or adults, as well as TV shows, are dubbed into Italian. In big cities, original-version movies can also be seen in some theaters but it is not so common. Subtitles may be available on [[Late night television|late-night programs]] on mainstream TV channels, and on pay-TV all movies are available in the original language with Italian subtitles, many shows featuring their original [[soundtrack]]s.

Early in their careers, actors such as [[Alberto Sordi]] or [[Nino Manfredi]] worked extensively as dubbing actors. At one point, common practice in Italian cinema was to shoot scenes [[MOS (filmmaking)|MOS]] (motor only sync or motor only shot) and dub the dialogue in post-production. A notable example of this practice is ''[[The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly]]'', in which all actors had to dub in their own voices.

Video games are generally either dubbed into Italian (for instance [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]] saga, [[Halo (series)|Halo]] or [[Harry Potter (video games)|Harry Potter]] series etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Italian language.

A list of the voice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in Italian can be enlisted here.

=====Spain=====
In [[Spain]], practically all foreign television programs are shown dubbed in [[Spanish language|European Spanish]], as are most films. Some dubbing actors have achieved popularity for their voices, such as [[Constantino Romero]] (who dubs [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Darth Vader]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s [[The Terminator|Terminator]], among others) and [[Óscar Muñoz (filmmaking)|Óscar Muñoz]] (the official European Spanish dub-over voice artist for [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Hayden Christensen]]). Currently, with the spread of [[digital terrestrial television]], viewers can choose between the original and the dubbed soundtracks for most movies and television.

In some communities such as [[Catalonia]], some foreign programs are also dubbed into their own languages, different from European Spanish. Films from 
the Spanish-speaking America shown in these communities are shown in their original language, while strong regional accents (from the Spanish-speaking America or from Spain) may be subtitled in news and documentaries.

=====Germany, Austria and Switzerland=====
The [[German language|Germanophone]] dubbing market is the largest in Europe. Germany has the most foreign-movie-dubbing studios per capita and per given area in the world and according to the german newspaper [[Die Welt]] 52% of all voice actors currently work in the german dubbing industry. In Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], practically all films, shows, television series and foreign [[soap opera]]s are shown in dubbed versions created for the German market. However, in some of Switzerland's towns and cities (particularly along the language-borders), subtitled versions are common. Dubbing films is a traditional and common practice in German-speaking Europe, since subtitles are not accepted and used as much as in other European countries. According to a European study, Austria is the country with the highest rejection rate (more than 70 percent) of subtitles, followed by Italy, Spain and Germany.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
In German-speaking markets, [[PC game|computer]] and video games feature German text menus and are dubbed into the German language if speaking parts exist.

In recent years, Swiss and Austrian television stations have been showing increasing numbers of movies, series and TV-programmes in "dual sound," which means the viewer can choose between the original language (e.g. English) and the language of the channel (German, French or Italian, according to the location).

Although German-speaking [[voice actor]]s play only a secondary role, they are still notable for providing familiar voices to well-known actors. Famous foreign actors are known and recognized for their [[German language|German]] voice, and the German audience is used to them, so dubbing is also a matter of authenticity. However, in larger cities, there are theaters where movies can be seen in their original versions, as [[English language|English]] has become somewhat more popular among young educated viewers. On German [[mainstream]] television, films are never broadcast with subtitles, but pay-per-view programming is often available in the original language. Subtitled niche and [[art film]]s are sometimes aired on smaller networks.

German-dubbed versions sometimes diverge greatly from the original, especially in adding humorous elements to the original. In extreme cases, such as ''[[The Persuaders!]]'', the dubbed version was more successful than the English original. Often, translation adds [[sexually explicit]] gags the U.S. versions might not be allowed to use. For example, in ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]'', the translators changed ''"The [[Door hanger|Do Not Disturb sign]] will hang on the door tonight"'' to ''"The only hanging thing tonight will be the Do Not Disturb sign"''.

Some movies dubbed in Austria diverge from the German Standard version in addressing other people but only when the movies are dubbed into certain Austrian dialect versions. (Mr. and Mrs. are translated into Herr and Frau which is usually not translated in order to be in lip-sync).
Sometimes even English pronounced first names are translated and are pronounced into the correct German equivalent (English name "Bert" became Southern German pronounced name "Bertl" which is an abbreviation for any name either beginning or even ending with "bert", e.g. "Berthold" or "Albert".)

Some movies dubbed before [[German reunification|reunification]] exist in different versions for the [[East Germany|east]] and the [[West Germany|west]]. They use different translations, and often differ in the style of dubbing.

=====Czech Republic=====
In [[Czech Republic]], all foreign films, TV series, cartoons, and animated series are provided with Czech dubbing. All television channels (both free and paid) broadcast foreign films and series dubbed - with only very rare exceptions. In some foreign channels (in the past, for example, Hallmark Channel) broadcast in the Czech Republic, was broadcast sometimes Slovak dubbed versions (for example [[Living with the Dead (film)|Living with the Dead]]). According to the language laws for television broadcasting, there is no use of Slovak dubbing prohibited, because it is equivalent to the official language of that country. In Czech TV, for example, until 2002, the series of [[Dempsey and Makepeace]] was broadcast only in Slovak dubbing. Films in cinemas are usually provided only with subtitles, but some films like family films, films aimed at a young audience, and major film series (especially those in 3D) are also dubbed, and a subtitled version is available only in a few cinemas. It is also common for well-known foreign actors to be dubbed by one individual Czech voice actor; for instance [[Clint Eastwood]] has been dubbed by Ladislav Županič in 39 of 42 films distributed in the Czech Republic.

=====Slovakia=====
In [[Slovakia]], home media market, Czech dubbed versions are widely used, with only children's films and some few exceptions (for example [[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]) that have been dubbed for cinema being released with Slovak dubbing. Czech dubbing was also extensively used in the broadcast of Slovak television channels, but since 2008 Slovak language laws require any newer shows (understood as the first television broadcast in Slovakia) to be provided with Slovak localization (dubbing or subtitles); since then, television broadcasts of films, TV series and cartoons have been dubbed into Slovak.

=====Hungary=====
&lt;!-- Please do not change this section to Romanian because the sources in this section are directly related to Hungary.--&gt;
In [[Hungary]], dubbing is almost universally common. Almost every foreign movie or TV show released in Hungary is dubbed into Hungarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://matadornetwork.com/abroad/9-culture-shocks-americans-will-hungary/ |title=9 culture shocks Americans will have in Hungary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of dubbing dates back to the 1950s, when the country was still under communist rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.masterfilm.hu/services |title=Masterfilm :: Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most iconic Hungarian dubs was of the American cartoon ''[[The Flintstones]]'', with a local translation by [[József Romhányi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sherlockian-sherlock.com/the-dubbed-versions-of-sherlock-holmes.php |title=Dubbed versions Sherlock Holmes, dubbing, hungarian voices}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internetes Szinkron Adatbázis (ISzDB) is the largest Hungarian database for film dubs, with information for many live action and animated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iszdb.hu |title=ISzDb - Internetes Szinkron Adatbázis}}&lt;/ref&gt; On page 59 of the Eurobarometer, 84% of Hungarians said that they prefer dubbing over subtitles.&lt;ref name="eurobarometer" /&gt;

In the [[Socialism|socialist]] era, every film was dubbed with professional and mostly popular actors. Care was taken to make sure the same voice actor would lend his voice to the same original actor. In the early 1990s, as cinemas tried to keep up with showing newly released films, subtitling became dominant in the cinema. This, in turn, forced TV channels to make their own cheap versions of dubbed soundtracks for the movies they presented, resulting in a constant degrading of dubbing quality. Once this became customary, cinema distributors resumed the habit of dubbing for popular productions, presenting them in a below-average quality. However, every feature is presented with the original soundtrack in at least one cinema in large towns and cities.

However, in Hungary, most documentary films and series (for example, those on [[Discovery Channel]], [[National Geographic Channel]]) are made with [[Voice-over|voiceovers]]. Some old movies and series, or ones that provide non-translatable jokes and conversations (for example, the ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' television series), are shown only with subtitles.

There is a more recent problem arising from dubbing included on DVD releases. Many generations have grown up with an original (and, by current technological standards, outdated) soundtrack, which is either technologically (mono or bad quality stereo sound) or legally (expired soundtrack license) unsuitable for a DVD release. Many original features are released on DVD with a new soundtrack, which in some cases proves to be extremely unpopular, thus forcing DVD producers to include the original soundtrack. In some rare cases, the Hungarian soundtrack is left out altogether. This happens notably with Warner Home Video Hungary, which ignored the existence of Hungarian soundtracks completely, as they did not want to pay the licenses for the soundtracks to be included on their new DVD releases, which appear with improved picture quality, but very poor subtitling.

=====Poland=====
{{essay|section|date=October 2016}}
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
In [[Poland]], cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows. These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack. This method, called "juxtareading," is similar to the so-called [[Gavrilov translation]] in Russia, with one difference—all dialogues are voiced by one lector, preferably with a deep and neutral voice which does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background. To some extent, it resembles live translation. Certain highly qualified voice talents are traditionally assigned to particular kinds of production, such as action or drama. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.

It is claimed that, until around 1951, there were no revoiced foreign movies available in Poland. Instead, they were exclusively subtitled in Polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Das kulturelle Leben der Deutschen in Niederschlesien unter polnischer Verwaltung. 1947-1958|first=Bernhard|last=Grund|publisher=Bundesministerium für gesamtdeutsche Fragen|place=Bonn und Berlin|date=1967|series=Bonner Berichte aus Mittel- und Ostdeutschland|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars. In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were ''[[Dangerous Curves (1929 film)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1929), ''[[The Dance of Life]]'' (1929), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930). In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in [[Łódź]]. The first film dubbed that year was ''Russkiy Vopros'' (filmed 1948).

Polish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronization. Polish dialogues were not always audible and the cinema equipment of those time often made films sound less clear than they were. In the 1950s, Polish publicists discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.

The number of dubbed movies and the quality improved. Polish dubbing had a golden age between the 1960s and the 1980s. Approximately a third of foreign movies screened in cinemas were dubbed. The "Polish dubbing school" was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The person who initiated high-quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Forsyte Saga]]'', ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', ''[[I, Claudius]]'', ''[[I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)|I'll Take Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Peter the Great (TV series)|Peter the Great]]''.

In the 1980s, due to budget cuts, state-run TV saved on tapes by voicing films over live during transmission.

Overall, during 1948-1998, almost 1,000 films were dubbed in Polish. In the 1990s, dubbing films and TV series continued, although often also for one emission only.

In 1995, [[Canal+]] was launched in Poland. In its first years, it dubbed 30% of its schedule dubbing popular films and TV series, one of the best-known and popular dubbings was that of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', but this proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222233455/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119215016517556740 On Polish TV, Desperate Wives Sound Like Guys], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', October 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions. In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as [[Wizja Jeden]]. They mainly dubbed [[BBC]] productions such as ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''. Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001. In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series ''[[Frasier]]'', although that dubbing was very popular.

Currently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of ''Shrek'', which contained many references to local culture and Polish humour. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of [[DVD|DVD releases]], most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either voice over or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.

Since theatrical release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for cinema releases. Also in 2012, [[United International Pictures]] Polska dubbed ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', while Forum Film Polska – former distributor of Disney's films – decided to dub ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', along with its [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|two]] [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|sequels]]. However, when a dub is produced but the film's target audience is not exclusively children, both dubbed and subtitled versions are usually available in movie theaters. The dubbed versions are more commonly shown in morning and early afternoon hours, with the subtitled version dominating in the evening. Both can be available in parallel at similar hours in multiplexes.

=====Russia=====
[[Russia]]n television is generally dubbed, but in the cases using voice-over dub technique with only a couple of voice actors, with the original speech still audible underneath. In the [[Soviet Union]], most foreign movies to be officially released were dubbed. Voice-over dub was invented in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1980s when with the fall of the regime, many popular foreign movies, previously forbidden, or at least questionable under communist rule, started to flood in, in the form of low-quality home-copied videos. Being unofficial releases, they were dubbed in a very primitive way. For example, the translator spoke the text directly over the audio of a video being copied, using primitive equipment.

The quality of the resulting dub was very low, the translated phrases were off-sync, interfering with the original voices, background sounds leaked into the track, translation was inaccurate and, most importantly, all dub voices were made by a single person who usually lacked the intonation of the original, making comprehension of some scenes quite difficult. This method of translation exerted a strong influence on Russian pop culture. Voices of translators became recognizable for generations.

In modern Russia, the overdubbing technique is still used in many cases, although with vastly improved quality, and now with multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices. Video games are generally either dubbed into Russian (for instance ''The Legend of Spyro'' trilogy, ''Skylanders'' series, ''Assassin's Creed'' saga, ''Halo'' or ''Harry Potter'' series etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Russian language.

Releases of cinemas are almost always dubbed in the Russian language. On television series are shown as a dubbed translation and offscreen. Subtitles are not used at all.

=====Ukraine=====
In [[Ukraine]], since 2006 cinema releases are almost always dubbed into Ukrainian with the overdubbing technique and multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices with a small percent of art-house/documentaries shown in the original language with Ukrainian subtitles. For television, TV channels usually release movies and TV-shows with a Ukrainian voiceover, although certain high-profile films and TV shows are dubbed rather than voice-overe'ed.

In the past Russian-language films, TV series, cartoons, animated series and TV programs were usually not dubbed but were shown with the original audio with Ukrainian subtitles. However, this practise has been slowly abandoned since late 2010s: all children's films and cartoons regardless of the original language (including Russian) are always dubbed into Ukrainian; example of the first Russian cartoons dubbed into Ukrainian for the cinematic-release is [[The Snow Queen 2]] (2015), [[A Warrior's Tail]] (2015), Volki i Ovtsy: Be-e-e-zumnoe prevrashenie (2016), Ivan Tsarevich i Seryy Volk 3 (2016), Bremenskie razboyniki (2016), [[The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice|The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice (2017)]], [[Fantastic Journey to OZ]] (2017), Fixies: Top Secret (2017) etc.; the same trend is seen among Russian language feature films for adults, with the first such films dubbed into Ukrainian including [[Battle for Sevastopol|Battle for Sevastopol (2015)]], [[Hardcore Henry|Hardcore Henry (2016)]], [[The Duelist (2016 film)|The Duelist (2016)]].

===Americas===
====United States and English-speaking Canada====
In the United States and English-speaking Canada, [[live-action]] foreign films are usually shown in theaters with their original languages (with English subtitles). It is because live-action dubbed movies rarely did well in United States box office since 1980's. The 1982 United States theatrical release of Wolfgang Peterson’s ''[[Das Boot]]'' was the last major release to go out in both original and English-dubbed versions, and the film's original version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/1999/08/editorial-life-isnt-beautiful-anymore-its-dubbed-82123/|title=EDITORIAL: Life Isn’t Beautiful Anymore, it’s Dubbed|first=|last=Indiewire|date=23 August 1999|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20180805152511/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&amp;gwt=pay|title=Will Dubbing Fly in the U.S.? Read My Lips - The New York Times|date=5 August 2018|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Later on, English-dubbed versions of international hits like ''[[Un indien dans la ville]]'', ''[[Godzilla 2000]]'', ''[[Anatomy (film)|Anatomy]]'', ''[[Pinocchio (2002 film)|Pinocchio]]'' and ''[[High Tension]]'' flopped at United States box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1996/04/02/little-indian-big-mistake/be40c0e7-fbb7-42ba-aa35-8481c485f29a/?utm_term=.3e5fbdab6cf5&amp;noredirect=on|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180718041749/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1996/04/02/little-indian-big-mistake/be40c0e7-fbb7-42ba-aa35-8481c485f29a/?utm_term=.3e5fbdab6cf5&amp;noredirect=on|deadurl=yes|title=LITTLE INDIAN': BIG MISTAKE - The Washington Post|date=18 July 2018|archivedate=18 July 2018|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeguru.com/082100.htm|title=Weekend Box Office|first=Gitesh|last=Pandya|website=www.boxofficeguru.com|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/07/entertainment/et-horn7|title='Pinocchio' will try again, in Italian|first=John|last=Horn|date=7 February 2003|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2018|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2009/10/girl-with-dragon-tattoo-gets-u-s-release-239436/|title=Girl with Dragon Tattoo Gets U.S. Release|first=Anne|last=Thompson|date=11 October 2009|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When [[Miramax]] planned to release the English-dubbed versions of ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'' and ''[[Hero (movie)|Hero]]'' in the United States cinemas, their English-dubbed versions scored badly in test screenings in the United States, so Miramax finally released the films in United States cinemas with their original language.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Xu|first=Gary G.|title=Sinascape: Contemporary Chinese Cinema|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|year=2007|page=44|isbn=0742554503}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Still, English-dubbed movies have much better commercial potential in [[ancillary market]]; therefore, more distributors would release live-action foreign films in theaters with their original languages (with English subtitles), then release both original versions and English-dubbed versions in [[ancillary market]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ault, Susanne. "Magnolia speaks English, more", ''[[Video Business]]'', 28 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  

On the other hand, [[anime]] is almost always released in English-dubbed format, regardless of its content or target age group. The exceptions to this practice are either when an English dub has not been produced for the program (usually in the case of feature films) or when the program is being presented by a network that places importance on presenting it in its original format (as was the case when [[Turner Classic Movies]] aired several of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s works, which were presented both dubbed and subtitled). Most [[anime]] DVDs contain options for original Japanese, Japanese with subtitles, and English-dubbed, except for a handful of series that have been heavily edited or [[Americanized]]. In addition, Disney has a policy that makes its directors undergo stages to perfect alignment of certain lip movements so the movie looks believable.

In addition, a small number of British films have been re-dubbed when released in the United States, due to the usage of dialects which Americans are not familiar with (for example, ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'' and ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''). However, British children's shows (such as ''[[Bob the Builder]]'') are always re-dubbed with American voice actors in order to make the series more understandable for American children. Conversely, British programs shown in Canada are not re-dubbed.

====Spanish-speaking countries====
For Spanish-speaking countries, all foreign-language programs, films, cartoons and documentaries shown on free-to-air TV networks are dubbed into [[Standard Spanish]], while broadcasts on [[Cable television|cable]] and [[Satellite television|satellite]] pan-regional channels are either dubbed or subtitled. In theaters, children's movies and most blockbuster films are dubbed into Standard Spanish or [[Mexican Spanish]], and are sometimes further dubbed into regional dialects of Spanish where they are released.

====Mexico====
In [[Mexico]], by law, films shown in theaters must be shown in their original version. Films in languages other than Spanish are usually subtitled. Only educational documentaries and movies rated for children, as well as some movies that are expected to have a wide audience (for example, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' or ''[[Marvel's The Avengers|The Avengers]]'') may be dubbed, but this is not compulsory, and some animated films are shown in theaters in both dubbed and subtitled versions (for instance, some [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] productions). Nonetheless, a recent trend in several cinemas is to offer the dubbed versions only, with a stark decrease in the showing of the original ones.

Dubbing must be made in Mexico by Mexican nationals or foreigners residing in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |format=PDF |title=Ley Federal de Cinematografía |language=Spanish |trans-title=Federal Law of Filmmaking |publisher=Cámara de Diputados |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=22 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722125937/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, several programs that are shown on pay TV are dubbed in other countries like [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]] or [[Colombia]].

Most movies released on DVD feature [[Standard Spanish|neutral Spanish]] as a language option, and sometimes feature a specific dub for Mexican audiences (for example, ''Rio''). Foreign programs are dubbed on [[broadcast television systems|broadcast TV]], while on [[pay TV]] most shows and movies are subtitled. It must be noted, however, that in a similar way to cinemas, in the last few years many channels on pay TV have begun to broadcast programs and films only in their dubbed version.

Dubbing became very popular in the 1990s with the rise in popularity of anime in Mexico. Some voice actors have become celebrities and are always identified with specific characters, such as [[Mario Castañeda]] (who became popular by dubbing [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'') or [[Humberto Vélez]] (who dubbed [[Homer Simpson]] in the first 15 seasons of ''[[The Simpsons]]'').

The popularity of pay TV has allowed people to view several series in their original language rather than dubbed. Dubbing has been criticized for the use of TV or movie stars as voice actors (such as [[Ricky Martin]] on Disney's ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', or [[Eugenio Derbez]] on DreamWorks' ''Shrek''), or for the incorrect use of local popular culture that sometimes creates unintentional jokes or breaks the feeling of the original work (such as translating [[Sheldon Cooper]]'s "Bazinga!" to "¡Vacilón!").

Several video games have been dubbed into neutral Spanish, rather than European Spanish, in Mexico (such as the ''Gears of War'' series, ''Halo 3'', ''Infamous 2'' and others). [[Sony]] recently announced that more games (such as ''God of War: Ascension'') will be dubbed into neutral Spanish.

====Peru====
In [[Peru]], all foreign series, movies, and animated programming are shown dubbed in Latin American Spanish, with dubs imported from Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela on terrestrial and pay-television. All movies intended for kids are being offered as dub-only movies, while films aimed at older audiences are being offered dubbed and subtitled in Spanish. Pay-TV channels show both dubbed and subtitled version of every film they broadcast, being offered with a separate subtitle track and a second audio track in English. Peru doesn't produce their own dubs since dubbing studios never existed in that country. However, there is an increase of people preferring subtitle films and series rather than dubbed starting the late-2000s, as Peruvians viewers tend to get used to their original version.

====Brazil====
In [[Brazil]], foreign programs are invariably dubbed into [[Brazilian Portuguese]] on broadcast TV, with only a few exceptions. Films shown at cinemas are generally offered with both subtitled and dubbed versions, with dubbing frequently being the only choice for children's movies. Subtitling was primarily for adult audience movies until 2012. Since then, dubbed versions also became available for all ages. As a result, in recent years, more cinemas have opened in Brazil, attracting new audiences to the cinema who prefer dubbing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140319091221/http://ne10.uol.com.br/canal/cultura/noticia/2012/05/27/cresce-preferencia-por-filmes-dublados-nos-cinemas-brasileiros-344927.php Cresce preferência por filmes dublados nos cinemas brasileiros (in Portuguese)] Ne10, 27 May 2012. Retrieved 17 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 90's, with Saint Seiya, Dragon Ball and other anime shows becoming popular in Brazilian TV's, the voice actors and the dubbing career gained a higher space in Brazilian culture. Actors like [[Hermes Baroli]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Pegasus Seiya]], in ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' and actors like [[Ashton Kutcher]]), [[Marco Ribeiro]] (Brazilian dubber of many actors like [[Tom Hanks]], [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]], and [[Yusuke Urameshi]] from the anime ''[[Yu Yu Hakusho]]'') and [[Wendel Bezerra]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] in ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'') are recognized for their most notable roles.

Pay TV commonly offers both dubbed and subtitled movies, with statistics showing that dubbed versions are becoming predominant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oglobo.globo.com/revista-da-tv/dublagem-em-canais-de-tv-paga-provoca-polemica-3262532 Dublagem em canais de TV paga provoca polêmica (in Portuguese)] O Globo, 20 November 2011. Retrieved 17 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually feature Portuguese, Spanish, and the original audio along with subtitles in native languages. Most video games are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese rather than having European Portuguese dubs alone. Games such as ''[[Halo 3]]'', ''[[God of War: Ascension]]'', ''[[inFamous 2]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', ''[[Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and others are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese. This is because despite the dropping of the dubbing law in Portugal in 1994, most companies in that country use the Brazilian Portuguese because of traditional usage during the days of the dubbing rule, along with these dubbings being more marketable than European Portuguese.

A list that showcases Brazilian Portuguese voice artists that dub for actors and actresses are displayed here. However, there can also be different official dub artists for certain regions within Brazil.

Apparently, for unknown reasons (probably technical), the Brazilian Portuguese dub credits from some shows or cartoons from channels from Viacom or Turner/Time Warner, are shown on Latin America (on Spanish-dubbed series).

====French-speaking Canada====
In [[Quebec]], Canada, most films and TV programs in English are dubbed into [[Standard French]], occasionally with [[Quebec French]] idiosyncrasies. Occasionally, the dubbing of a series or a movie, such as ''The Simpsons'', is made using the more widely spoken ''[[joual]]'' variety of Quebec French. Dubbing has the advantage of making children's films and TV series more comprehensible to younger audiences. However, many [[bilingual]] Québécois prefer subtitling, since they would understand some or all of the original audio. In addition, all films are shown in English, as well in certain theaters (especially in major cities and English-speaking areas such as the [[West Island]]), and some theatres, such as the Scotiabank Cinema [[Montreal]], show only movies in English. Most American television series are only available in English on [[DVD]], or on English-language channels, but some of the more popular ones have French dubs shown on mainstream networks, and are released in French on DVD as well, sometimes separately from an English-only version.

Formerly, all French-language dubbed films in Quebec were imported from France and some still are. Such a practice was criticized by former politician [[Mario Dumont]] after he took his children to see the [[Standard French|Parisian French]] dub of ''Shrek the Third'', which Dumont found incomprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec-pressing-hollywood-to-justify-lack-of-movie-dubbing/article1352554/ Quebec pressing Hollywood to justify lack of movie dubbing], The Canadian Press, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 26 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; After his complaints and a proposed bill, ''[[Bee Movie]]'', the film from [[DreamWorks Animation]], was dubbed in Quebec, making it the studio's first animated film to have a Quebec French dub, as all DreamWorks Animation films had previously been dubbed in France. In terms of Disney, the first Disney animated movie to be dubbed in Quebec was ''Oliver and Company.'' The Disney Renaissance films were also dubbed in Quebec except for ''The Rescuers Down Under'', ''Beauty and the Beast'', and ''The Lion King''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Drôle d'abeille (v.o.a) Bee Movie |url=http://doublage.qc.ca/showMovie.php?id=1981 |work=Doublage.qc.ca |publisher=idgrafix |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Doublage.qc.ca |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, because Canadian viewers usually find Quebec French more comprehensible than other dialects of the language, some older film series that had the French-language versions of previous installments dubbed in France have had later ones dubbed in Quebec, often creating inconsistencies within the French version of the series' canon. [[Lucasfilm]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' series are examples. Both series had films released in the 1970s and 1980s, with no Québécois French dubbed versions; instead, the Parisian French versions, with altered character and object names and terms, were distributed in the province. However, later films in both series released 1999 and later were dubbed in Quebec, using different voice actors and "reversing" name changes made in France's dubbings due to the change in studio.

====China====
China has a long tradition of dubbing foreign films into [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], starting in the 1930s. While during the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] era Western motion pictures may have been imported and dubbed into Chinese, since 1950 [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet movies]], dubbed primarily in Shanghai, became the main import.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|1987|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the late 1970s, in addition to films, popular TV series from the United States, Japan, Brazil, and Mexico were also dubbed. The [[Shanghai]] Film Dubbing Studio has been the most well-known studio in the film dubbing industry in China. In order to generate high-quality products, they divide each film into short segments, each one lasting only a few minutes, and then work on the segments one-by-one. In addition to the correct meaning in translation, they make tremendous effort to match the lips of the actors to the dialogue. As a result, the dubbing in these films generally is not readily detected. The cast of dubbers is acknowledged at the end of a dubbed film. Several dubbing actors and actresses of the Shanghai Film Dubbing Studio have become well-known celebrities, such as Qiu Yuefeng, Bi Ke, Li Zi, and Liu Guangning. In recent years, however, especially in the larger cities on the east and south coasts, it has become increasingly common for movie theaters to show subtitled versions with the original soundtracks intact.

Motion pictures are also dubbed into the languages of some of China's [[Autonomous administrative divisions of China|autonomous regions]]. Notably, the Translation Department of the [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]] Movie Company (西藏自治区电影公司译制科)&lt;ref name=humes20131122&gt;[http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 Confucius the Movie: China Flop Dubbed at the State’s Expense for Tibetan Movie-goers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130085415/http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 |date=30 November 2013 }}, 22 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; has been dubbing movies into the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]] since the 1960s. In the early decades, it would dub 25 to 30 movies each year, the number rising to 60-75 by the early 2010s.&lt;ref name=humes20131122/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/china/Off_the_Wire/2013-02/24/content_28045511.htm China Focus: Dubbed movies spice up life for Tibetans], Xinhua News Agency, 24 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Motion pictures are dubbed for China's [[Mongols in China|Mongol-]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur-speaking]] markets as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

====Taiwan====
[[Taiwan]] dubs some foreign films and TV series in Mandarin Chinese. Until the mid-1990s, the major national [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial channels]] both dubbed and subtitled all foreign programs and films and, for some popular programs, the original voices were offered in [[second audio program]]. Gradually, however, both terrestrial and cable channels stopped dubbing for [[prime time]] U.S. shows and films, while subtitling continued.

In the 2000s, the dubbing practice has differed depending on the nature and origin of the program. Animations, children's shows and some educational programs on PTS are mostly dubbed. English live-action movies and shows are not dubbed in theaters or on television. Japanese TV dramas are no longer dubbed, while [[Korean language|Korean]] dramas, [[Hong Kong]] dramas and dramas from other Asian countries are still often dubbed. Korean variety shows are not dubbed. Japanese and Korean films on Asian movie channels are still dubbed. In theaters, most foreign films are not dubbed, while animated films and some films meant for children offer a dubbed version. Hong Kong live-action films have a long tradition of being dubbed into Mandarin, while more famous films offer a [[Cantonese]] version.

====Hong Kong====
In [[Hong Kong]], foreign television programmes, except for English-language and Mandarin television programmes, are dubbed in Cantonese. English-language and Mandarin programmes are generally shown in their original with subtitles. Foreign films, such as most live-action and animated films (such as anime and Disney), are usually dubbed in Cantonese. However most cinemas also offer subtitled versions of English-language films.

For the most part, foreign films and TV programmes, both live-action and animated, are generally dubbed in both Mandarin and Cantonese. For example, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film series, Elijah Wood's character [[Frodo Baggins]] was dubbed into Mandarin by [[Jiang Guangtao]] for China and Taiwan. For the Cantonese localization, there were actually two dubs for Hong Kong and [[Macau]]. The first Cantonese dub, he was voiced by Leung Wai Tak, with a second Cantonese dub released, he was voiced by Bosco Tang.

A list for Mandarin and Cantonese voice artists that dub for actors are shown here.

====Israel====
In [[Israel]], only children's movies and TV programming are dubbed in [[Hebrew]]. In programs aimed at teenagers and adults, dubbing is rarely considered for translation, not only because of its high costs, but also because the audience is mainly multi-lingual. Most viewers in Israel speak at least one European language in addition to Hebrew, and a large part of the audience also speaks [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Therefore, most viewers prefer to hear the original soundtrack, aided by Hebrew subtitles. Another problem is that dubbing does not allow for translation into two different languages simultaneously, as is often the case of Israeli television channels that use subtitles in Hebrew and another language (like [[Russian language|Russian]]) simultaneously.

====Japan====
In Japan, many television programs appear on Japanese television subtitled or dubbed if they are intended for children. When the American film ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' was released in Japan in 1931, subtitles became the mainstream method of translating TV programs and films in Japan. Later, around the 1950s, foreign television programs and films began to be shown dubbed in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] on television. The first ones to be dubbed into Japanese were [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|the 1940s Superman cartoons]] in 1955.

Due to the lack of video software for domestic television, video software was imported from abroad. When the television program was shown on television, it was mostly dubbed. There was a character limit for a small TV screen at a lower resolution, and this method was not suitable for the poor elderly and illiterate eye, as was audio dubbing. Presently, TV shows and movies (both those aimed at all ages and adults-only) are shown dubbed with the original language and Japanese subtitles, while providing the original language option when the same film is released on [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]].

Adult cartoons such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' are shown dubbed in Japanese on the [[WOWOW]] TV channel. ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut]]'' was dubbed in Japanese by different actors instead of the same Japanese dubbing-actors from the cartoon because it was handled by a different Japanese dubbing studio, and it was marketed for the [[Kansai region|Kansai]] market. In Japanese theaters, foreign-language movies, except those intended for children, are usually shown in their original version with Japanese subtitles. Foreign films usually contain multiple Japanese-dubbing versions, but with several different original Japanese-dubbing voice actors, depending upon which TV station they are aired. [[NHK]], [[Nippon TV]], [[Fuji TV]], [[TV Asahi]], and [[TBS (TV Channel)|TBS]] usually follow this practice, as do software releases on [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]. As for recent foreign films being released, there are now some film theaters in Japan that show both dubbed and subtitled editions.

On 22 June 2009, [[20th Century Fox]]'s Japanese division has opened up a [[Blu-Ray]] lineup known as "Emperor of Dubbing", dedicated at having multiple Japanese dubs of popular English-language films (mostly Hollywood films) as well as retaining the original scripts, releasing them altogether in special Blu-Ray releases. These also feature a new dub created exclusively for that release as a director's cut, or a new dub made with a better surround sound mix to match that of the original English mix (as most older Japanese dubbings were made on mono mixes to be aired on TV). Other companies have followed practice, like Universal Pictures's Japanese division [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan]] opening up "Reprint of Memories", along with [[:ja:ワーナー エンターテイメント ジャパン|Warner Bros Japan]] having "Power of Dubbing", which act in a similar way by re-packaging all the multiple Japanese dubs of popular films and putting them out as Special Blu-ray releases.

====South Korea====
In South Korea, anime that are imported from Japan are generally shown dubbed in Korean on television. However, some anime is censored, such as Japanese letters or content being edited for a suitable Korean audience. Western cartoons are dubbed in Korean as well, such as [[Nickelodeon]] cartoons like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Danny Phantom]]''. Several English-language (mostly American) live-action films are dubbed in [[Korean language|Korean]], but they are not shown in theaters. Instead they are only broadcast on South Korean television networks ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]], [[Educational Broadcasting System|EBS]]), while DVD import releases of these films are shown with Korean subtitles, such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. This may be due to the fact that the six American [[major film studio]]s may not own any rights to the Korean dubs of their live-action films that the Korean television networks have dubbed and aired. Even if they don't own the rights, Korean or non-Korean viewers can record from Korean-dubbed live-action films from television broadcasting onto DVDs with [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]].

Sometimes, video games are dubbed in Korean. Examples would be the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' series, the ''[[Jak &amp; Daxter (series)|Jak &amp; Daxter]]'' series, and the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series. For the ''Halo'' games, Lee Jeong Gu provides his Korean voice to the main protagonist [[Characters of Halo|Master Chief]] (replacing [[Steve Downes]]'s voice), while [[Kim So Hyeong (voice actor)|Kim So Hyeong]] voices [[Characters of Halo|Chieftain Tartarus]], one of the main antagonists (replacing [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]'s voice).

The following South Korean voice-over artists are usually identified with the following actors:

====Thailand====
In [[Thailand]], foreign television programs are dubbed in [[Thai Language|Thai]], but the original soundtrack is often simultaneously carried on a [[NICAM]] audio track on terrestrial broadcast, and alternate audio tracks on satellite broadcast. Previously, terrestrial stations simulcasted the original soundtrack on the radio.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=56punueI7G0C&amp;lpg=RA8-PA257&amp;ots=yqkUlk8nDY&amp;dq=TV%20stations%20%20broadcast%20the%20original%20soundtrack%20on%20the%20radio%20Thailand&amp;pg=RA8-PA257#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''The Right to Tell: The Role of Mass Media in Economic Development''], Roumeen Islam, World Bank Publications, 2002, page 257&lt;/ref&gt; On pay-TV, many channels carry foreign-language movies and television programs with subtitles. Movie theaters in [[Bangkok]] and some larger cities show both the subtitled version and the dubbed version of English-language movies. In big cities like Bangkok, Thai-language movies have English subtitles. &lt;!-- For English-language animated movies, Disney films like ''[[The Lion King]]'', ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' and ''[[Tangled]]'' are dubbed entirely in Thai.

Chonnai Sukawat has provided the Thai-dubbing voice for the heroine Rapunzel in the film ''Tangled''. In the Thai version of ''Harry Potter'', [[Hermione Granger]] was dubbed by Thai singer and actress Bismillah Nana. Many English-language movies are sold on [[VCD]]s in Thailand, with the original English language and Thai subtitles, while also available with the Thai-language-dubbed version, such as ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', the ''Harry Potter'' film series, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series. Thai [[Thai television soap opera|lakorns]] have English subtitles if broadcast on international television channels or are sold as DVD abroad. --&gt;

This list features a collection of Thai voice actors and actresses that have dubbed for these featured performers.

====Indonesia====
Unlike movie theaters in most Asian countries, those in Indonesia show foreign movies with subtitles. Then a few years or months later, those movies appear on TV either dubbed in Indonesian or subtitled. Kids shows are mostly dubbed, even though in cartoon series, songs aren't dubbed, but in big movies such as Disney movies, both speaking and singing voice were cast for the new Indonesian dub even though it took maybe a few months or even years for the movie to come out. Adult films was mostly subtitled, but sometimes they can be dubbed as well, because there aren't many Indonesian voices, mostly in dubbed movies, three character can have exactly the same voice.

Reality shows never dubbed in Indonesian, because it was not a planned-interaction such as in movies, so if they appear in TV, it will be appear with subtitles on it.

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, media practitioners generally have mixed practices regarding whether to dub television programes or films, even within the same kind of medium.
They have mixed only with the dub television files and for G and PG graph square boundary.

=====Free-to-air TV=====
The prevalence of media needing to be dubbed has resulted in a talent pool that is very capable of syncing voice to lip, especially for shows broadcast by the country's three largest networks. It is not uncommon in the Filipino dub industry to have most of the voices in a series dubbing by only a handful of voice talents. English-language programmes used to usually air in their original language in free-to-air television. However, since the late 1990s/early 2000s, more English-language programmes that air on major free-to-air networks (i.e. TV5, ABS-CBN, GMA) have been dubbed into Tagalog. Even Studio 23 (now ABS-CBN Sports and Action) which used to show all of its foreign programmes in English, had adopted dubbing for some of its foreign programmes. Children's programmes from cable networks [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Disney Channel]] shown on [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] or ABS-CBN, have long been dubbed into Tagalog or another Philippine regional language. Also [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|animated Disney films]] are often dubbed in Tagalog, except for the singing parts, which retains its original language (though in recent years, there has been an increase in number of Disney musicals having their songs also translated such as ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''). Dubbing is less common in smaller free-to-air networks such as [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]], [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]] and the former [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]] and the original language version is aired. Also popular in the Philippines are Chinese, Korean, and Mexican dramas, which are called ''Chinovelas'', ''Koreanovelas'', and ''Mexicanovelas'', respectively. All of these dramas have always been dubbed in Tagalog or another Philippine regional language, with its unique set of Filipino-speaking voice actors.

As of late 2018 only two [[Nickelodeon]] shows are aired in Filipino Dub on [[ABS-CBN]] after the Nick block was dissolved while [[GMA Network]] have lots of them. As for Kids on 5 block on [[The 5 Network]], most Disney shows will come to an end in late 2018 and the local version of DisneyLife will add to its own language (Filipino) due to Disney-Fox merger but DreamWorks shows will continue unchanged.

=====Pay TV=====
The original language version of TV programmes is also usually available on cable/satellite channels such as [[Fox Life]], [[Fox Asia|Fox]], and AXN. However, some channels where foreign films or TV series are dubbed into Tagalog have proliferated. [[Cinema One]], ABS-CBN's cable movie channel, shows some films from abroad dubbed into Tagalog. [[Nat Geo Wild]] airs most programs dubbed into Tagalog for Philippine audiences, being one of the few cable channels to do so. [[Tagalized Movie Channel]] &amp; [[Tag (TV channel)|Tag]] airs Hollywood and Asian movies dubbed in Tagalog. [[Fox Filipino]] airs some English, Latin, and Asian series dubbed in Tagalog such as ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', ''[[Devious Maids]]'', ''La Teniente'', ''Kdabra'', and some selected programs from [[Channel M (Southeast Asia)|Channel M]]. [[GMA News TV]] airs some English-language documentaries, movies, and reality series dubbed in Tagalog. The defunct channel [[Hero (TV channel)|HERO TV]], which focuses on anime and [[tokusatsu]] shows and now a web portal, dubs all its foreign programs into Tagalog. This is in contrast to Animax, where their anime programs dubbed in English.

=====Cinema=====
Foreign films especially English films shown in cinemas are almost always shown in their original language. Non-English films make use of English subtitles. Unlike other countries, children's films in English are not dubbed in cinemas.

A list of voice actors with their associates that they dub into Tagalog are listed here.

====India====
In [[India]], where "foreign films" are synonymous with "[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood films]]", dubbing is done mostly in three Indian languages, including [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. Dubbing of foreign languages is rarely done with the other major Indian languages, namely [[Malayalam]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]], due to the high literacy rate among the population who speak the languages. Despite this, some [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Malayalam]] dubs of children television programs can be seen on [[Sun TV Network|Sun TV]]'s channel. The finished works are released into the towns and lower tier settlements of the respective states (where English penetration is low), often with the English-language originals released in the metropolitan areas. In all other states, the English originals are released along with the dubbed versions, where often the dubbed version collections are more outstanding than the originals. ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' was also done in the [[Bhojpuri language]], a language popular in [[East India|eastern India]] in addition to Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. ''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]'', the most recent installment in the ''[[Die Hard (franchise)|Die Hard]]'' franchise, was the first ever Hollywood film to receive a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi language dub]] as well.

Most TV channels mention neither the Indian-language dubbing credits, nor its staff, at the end of the original ending credits, since changing the credits casting for the original actors or voice actors involves a huge budget for modifying, making it somewhat difficult to find information for the dubbed versions. The same situation is encountered for films. Sometimes foreign programs and films receive more than one dub, such as for example, [[Jumanji]], [[Dragonheart]] and [[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]] having two Hindi dubs. Information for the Hindi, Tamil and Telugu voice actors who have done the voices for specific actors and for their roles on foreign films and television programs are published in local Indian data magazines, for those that are involved in the dubbing industry in India. But on a few occasions, there are some foreign productions that do credit the dubbing cast, such as animated films like the ''[[Barbie (film series)|Barbie]]'' films, and some Disney films. [[Disney Channel]] original series released on DVD with their Hindi dubs show a list of the artists in the Hindi dub credits, after the original ending credits. Theatrical releases and VCD releases of foreign films do not credit the dubbing cast or staff. The DVD releases, however, do have credits for the dubbing staff, if they are released multilingual. As of recently, information for the dubbing staff of foreign productions have been expanding due to high demands of people wanting to know the knowledge of the voice actors behind characters in foreign works. Various big popular dubbing studios in India are featured such as [[Sound &amp; Vision India]], [[Main Frame Software Communications]], [[Visual Reality]], [[ZamZam Productions]], [[Treasure Tower International]], [[Blue Whale Entertainment]], [[Jai Hand Entertainment]], [[Sugar Mediaz]], [[Rudra Sound Solutionz]] and more.

====Pakistan====
In [[Pakistan]] "foreign films", and cartoons are not normally dubbed locally. Instead, foreign films, anime and cartoons, such as those shown on [[Nickelodeon Pakistan]] and [[Cartoon Network Pakistan]], are dubbed in [[Hindi]] in India, as Hindi and [[Urdu]], the national language of Pakistan, are [[mutually intelligible]].
However, soap operas from [[Turkey]] are now dubbed in Urdu and have gained increased popularity at the expense of Indian soap operas in Hindi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstpost.com/living/in-pakistan-indian-soap-operas-give-way-to-turkish-serials-1260549.html In Pakistan, Indian soap operas give way to Turkish serials], ''[[First Post (India)|First Post]]'', 1 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to protests from local producers that these are a threat to Pakistan's television industry, with local productions being moved out of peak viewing time or dropped altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/news/772593/is-tv-drama-industry-overreacting-to-turkish-soaps-blitz Is TV drama industry overreacting to Turkish soaps blitz?], ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', 20 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, politicians leaders have expressed concerns over their content, given Turkey's less conservative culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/the-geopolitics-of-soap-operas/ The Geopolitics of Soap Operas], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vietnam====
In [[Vietnam]], foreign-language films and programs are subtitled on television in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. They were not dubbed until 1985, but are briefly translated with a speaker before commercial breaks. ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' was considered to be the very first American Hollywood film to be entirely dubbed in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. Since then, children's films that came out afterwards have been released dubbed in theaters. [[HTV3]] has dubbed television programs for children, including ''[[Ben 10 (TV series)|Ben 10]]'', and ''[[Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide]]'', by using various voice actors to dub over the character roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBlXxqhKwU |title=Ben 10 Vietnamese Trailer (Trailer Ben 10 - HTV3) |publisher=YouTube |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WbgyJP5-TA |title=HTV3 - Cẩm Nang Của Ned - Trailer |publisher=YouTube |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sooner afterwards, more programs started to get dubbed. HTV3 also offers anime dubbed into Vietnamese. [[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]] got a Vietnamese dub in early 2014 on HTV3 starting with the Best Wishes series. But due to a controversy regarding Pokémon's cries being re-dubbed despite that all characters had their Japanese names, it was switched to [[VTV2]] in September 2015 when the XY series debut. [[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]] also recently has been dubbed for HTV3 in Early 2015.

====Singapore====
In multilingual [[Singapore]], dubbing is rare for western programmes. English-language programmes on the free-to-air terrestrial channels are usually subtitled in Chinese or Malay. Chinese, Malay and Tamil programmes (except for news bulletins), are usually have subtitles in English and the original language during the prime time hours . [[Dual sound]] programs, such as Korean and Japanese dramas, offer sound in the original languages with subtitles, Mandarin-dubbed and subtitled, or English-dubbed. The [[Speak Mandarin Campaign|deliberate policy to encourage Mandarin]] among citizens made it required by law for programs in other Chinese dialects ([[Min Nan|Hokkien]], Cantonese and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]) to be dubbed into Mandarin, with the exception of traditional [[opera]]s. Cantonese and Hokkien shows from Hong Kong and Taiwan, respectively, are available on VCD and DVD. In a recent development, news bulletins are subtitled.

[[File:Iranian Dubbing artists.jpg|thumb|A group of Iranian dubbing artists]]
In [[Iran]], foreign films and television programs are dubbed in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Dubbing began in 1946 with the advent of movies and cinemas in the country. Since then, foreign movies have always been dubbed for the cinema and TV. Using various voice actors and adding local hints and witticisms to the original contents, dubbing played a major role in attracting people to the cinemas and developing an interest in other cultures. The dubbing art in Iran reached its apex during the 1960s and 1970s with the inflow of American, European and Hindi movies.

The most famous musicals of the time, such as ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', were translated, adjusted and performed in Persian by the voice artists. Since the 1990s, for political reasons and under pressure from the state, the dubbing industry has declined, with movies dubbed only for the state TV channels. During recent years, DVDs with Persian subtitles have found a market among viewers for the same reason, but most people still prefer the Persian-speaking dubbed versions. Recently, privately operated companies started dubbing TV series by hiring famous dubbers.

A list of Persian voice actors that associate with their actor counterparts are listed here.

====Georgia====
In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], original soundtracks are kept in TV series and films, but with voice-over translation. There are exceptions, such as some children's cartoons.

====Azerbaijan====
In [[Azerbaijan]], dubbing is rare, as most Azerbaijani channels such as [[Günəş TV|ARB Günəş]] air [[voice-overs]] or Azerbaijan originals.

===Africa===
====The Maghreb====
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
In [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]], most foreign movies (especially Hollywood productions) are shown dubbed in French. These movies are usually imported directly from French film distributors. The choice of movies dubbed into French can be explained by the history of colonization of these countries by France and the widespread use of the French language (among the intellectual elite), in addition to the marginalization the two spoken languages, Berber and Darija. Another important factor is that local theaters and private media companies do not dub in local languages in order to avoid high costs, but also because of the lack of both expertise and demand.

Beginning in the 1980s, dubbed series and movies for children in [[Modern Standard Arabic]] became a popular choice among most TV channels, cinemas and VHS/DVD stores. However, dubbed films are still imported, and dubbing is performed in Arab countries with a strong tradition of dubbing and subtitling (mainly [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]]). The evolution of movies targeting the adult audience was different. After the satellite boom in the [[Arab world]] and the emergence of Pan-Arab channels, the use of subtitles, which was already popular in the [[Middle East]], was highly popular among local viewers in Algeria and Morocco.

In the Arab world (member states in [[North Africa]], [[Western Asia]] and others), only children's films and TV series were dubbed in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Many different anime titles are dubbed in the Arabic language, as well. Everything else is usually shown in its original language with Arabic subtitles. Recently, The Arabic dubbing industry has boomed, and channels such as [[MBC Max]], are now offering famous older action films aimed at an older audience dubbed in Arabic to be broadcast on television. Action movies such as ''[[Braveheart (film)|Braveheart]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy and ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'' have become some of the first foreign action titles to be dubbed in Arabic, rather than using subtitles, on the [[MBC Max]] channel. However, they can still be watched in their original language with subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waleg.com/archives/017759.html |title=Blockbuster Movies in Arabic on MBC |publisher=Waleg.com |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There's even a list that showcases Arabic voice actors that dub for certain performers that associate with them.

In [[Tunisia]], theaters usually show French-dubbed movies, but cinema attendance in the country for such movies is in continuous decline compared to Tunisian and Arab movies. This decline can be traced to the huge popularity of free-to-air [[Pan-Arabism|Pan-Arab]] movie channels offering primarily subtitled content, and the government's reduced efforts to limit piracy. Tunisia National Television (TNT), the public broadcaster of Tunisia, is not allowed to show any content in any language other than Arabic, which forces it to broadcast only dubbed content (this restriction was recently removed for commercials). During the 1970s and 1980s, TNT (known as ERTT at the time) started dubbing famous cartoons in Tunisian and Standard Arabic. This move was highly successful locally, but was not able to compete with mainstream dubbing companies (especially in the Middle East). In the private sector, television channels are not subject to the language rule and sometimes broadcast foreign content dubbed into French (excluding children content), although some of them, such as [[Hannibal TV]], started adopting subtitling in Arabic instead, which proved to be more popular than simply importing French-dubbed content.{{dubious|date=October 2017}}

====South Africa====
In [[South Africa]], many television programmes were dubbed in [[Afrikaans]], with the original soundtrack (usually in English, but sometimes [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or [[German language|German]]) "[[simulcast]]" in [[FM stereo#Stereo FM|FM stereo]] on [[Radio 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-NRDAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=was+simulcast++Radio+2000+afrikaans&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Radio+2000+afrikaans ''The voice, the vision: a sixty year history of the South African Broadcasting Corporation''], Malcolm Theunissen, Victor Nikitin, Melanie Pillay, Advent Graphics, 1996, page 120&lt;/ref&gt; These included US series such as ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''(Steve Austin: Die Man van Staal)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvsa.co.za/mastershowinfo.asp?mastershowid=2293 The Six Million Dollar Man], TVSA - The South African TV Authority&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Miami Vice]]'' ''(Misdaad in Miami)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shows Allow Blacks, Whites to Share Cultural Experiences : South African Viewers Get a Mixed TV Message From U.S. Programs |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-25/news/mn-7271_1_south-african |accessdate=14 August 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=25 May 1986|author=GLENN FRANKEL (from ''The Washington Post'')}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/1996-02-09-the-critics-thumbs-up/ The critics' thumbs-up], ''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]'', 9 February 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and the German detective series ''[[Derrick (TV series)|Derrick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=BfdyVOHALcLbO4nNgMgD&amp;id=7h1DAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=derrick+tv+series+afrikaans&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=derrick+|title=Mass Media, Towards the Millennium|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[boycott]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] actors' union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], which banned the sale of most British television programmes, the [[puppet]] series ''[[The Adventures of Rupert Bear]]'' was dubbed into [[South African English]], as the original voices had been recorded by Equity voice artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |last=Bevan |first=C |year=2008 |title=Putting up screens: A history of television in South Africa, 1929-1976, MHCS dissertation, University of Pretoria, Pretoria |accessdate=1 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215155949/http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This practice has declined as a result of the reduction of airtime for the language on [[SABC]] TV, and the increase of locally produced material in Afrikaans on other channels like [[KykNet]]. Similarly, many programmes, such as ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', were dubbed into [[Zulu language|Zulu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lelyveld |first=Joseph |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/magazine/22SAFR.html?&amp;pagewanted=all |title=South Africa: Dream and Reality |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=22 September 1985 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this has also declined as local drama production has increased. However, some animated films, such as ''[[Maya the Bee]]'', have been dubbed in both Afrikaans and Zulu by local artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/News/Maya-the-Bee-flick-dubbed-into-Afrikaans-and-Zulu-for-SA-audience-20150910 Maya the Bee flick dubbed into Afrikaans and Zulu for SA audience], [[News24|Channel24]], 18 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

====Uganda====
Uganda's [[Cinema of Uganda|own film industry]] is fairly small, and foreign movies are commonly watched. The English sound track is often accompanied by the [[Luganda]] translation and comments, provided by an Ugandan "video jockey" (VJ). VJ's interpreting and narration may be available in a recorded form or live.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2012/11/cinema-uganda |title=Coming to you live
|date=2 November 2012|journal=The Economist|first=M|last=H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceania===
In common with other English-speaking countries, there has traditionally been little dubbing in [[Australia]], with foreign-language television programmes and films being shown (usually on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]) with subtitles or English dubs produced in other countries. This has also been the case in [[New Zealand]], but the [[Maori Television Service]], launched in 2004, has dubbed animated films into [[Maori language|Maori]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10117134 Maori TV broadens horizons], ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', 26 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, some TV commercials from foreign countries are dubbed, even if the original commercial came from another English-speaking country.

==Alternatives==
===Subtitles===
{{Main|Subtitle (captioning)}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[Subtitle (captioning)|Subtitles]] can be used instead of dubbing, as different countries have different traditions regarding the choice between dubbing and subtitling. On [[DVD]]s with higher translation budgets, the option for both types will often be provided to account for individual preferences; [[Purism|purist]]s often demand subtitles. For small markets (small language area or films for a select audience), subtitling is more suitable, because it is cheaper. In the case of films for small children who cannot yet read, or do not read fast enough, dubbing is necessary.

In most [[English language|English-speaking]] countries, dubbing is comparatively rare. In [[Israel]], some programmes need to be comprehensible to speakers of both [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. This cannot be accomplished with dubbing, so subtitling is much more commonplace—sometimes even with subtitles in multiple languages, with the soundtrack remaining in the original language, usually English. The same applies to certain television shows in [[Finland]], where [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] are both official languages.

In the [[Netherlands]], [[Flanders]], [[Nordic countries]], [[Estonia]] and [[Portugal]], films and television programmes are shown in the original language (usually English) with subtitles, and only cartoons and children's movies and programs are dubbed, such as the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', and others. Cinemas usually show both a dubbed version and one with subtitles for this kind of movie, with the subtitled version shown later in the evening.

In Portugal, one terrestrial channel, [[TVI (Portugal)|TVI]], dubbed U.S. series like ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref name="DCpt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sKswU7k_I |title=Dawson's Creek PT |first= |last=Somnorte |date=6 December 2008 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; RTP also transmitted ''[[Friends]]'' in a dubbed version, but it was poorly received and later re-aired in a subtitled version. Cartoons, on the other hand, are usually dubbed, sometimes by well-known actors, even on TV. Animated movies are usually released to the cinemas in both subtitled and dubbed versions.

In [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]], terrestrial channels air films and TV series in a dubbed version, as demanded by law. However, those same series can be seen on cable channels at more accessible time-slots in their subtitled version, and usually before they are shown on open TV. In contrast, the series ''The Simpsons'' is aired in its Mexican-dubbed version both on terrestrial television and on the cable station Fox, which broadcasts the series for the area. Although the first season of the series appeared with subtitles, this was not continued for the following seasons.

===Dubbing and subtitling===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
In [[Bulgaria]], television series are dubbed, but most television channels use subtitles for action and drama movies. [[AXN]] uses subtitles for its series, but as of 2008 emphasizes dubbing. Only [[Diema]] channels dub all programs. Movies in theaters, with the exception of films for children, use dubbing and subtitles. Dubbing of television programs is usually done using voiceovers, but usually, voices professional actors, while trying to give each character a different voice by using appropriate intonations. Dubbing with synchronized voices is rarely used, mostly for animated films. ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' is a rare example of a feature film dubbed this way on [[BNT Channel 1]], though a subtitled version is currently shown on other channels.

[[Walt Disney Television]]'s animated series (such as ''[[DuckTales]]'', ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', and ''[[Timon &amp; Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon &amp; Pumbaa]]'') were only aired with synchronized Bulgarian voices on [[BNT Channel 1]] until 2005, but then the Disney shows were canceled. When airing of Disney series resumed on [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] and [[Jetix]] in 2008, voiceovers were used, but Disney animated-movie translations still use synchronized voices. Voiceover dubbing is not used in theatrical releases. The Bulgarian film industry law requires all children's films to be dubbed, not subtitled. [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] dubbed and aired the ''Pokémon'' anime with synchronized voices. Now, the show is airing on Disney Channel, also in a synchronized form.

[[Netflix]] provides both subtitles and dubbed audio with its foreign language shows, including Brazil’s dystopian “[[3%]]” and the German thriller "[[Dark (TV series)|Dark]]". Viewer testing indicates that its audience is more likely to finish watching a series if they select to view it with dubbed audio rather than translated subtitles. Netflix now streams its foreign language content with dubbed audio as default in an effort to increase viewer retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/netflix-success-secrets-1202721847/|title=Netflix’s Secrets to Success: Six Cell Towers, Dubbing and More|last=Roettgers|first=Janko|date=2018-03-08|work=Variety|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General use==
Dubbing is also used in applications and genres other than traditional film, including video games, television, and pornographic films.

===Video games===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Many [[video game]]s originally produced in [[North America]], [[Japan]], and [[PAL]] countries are dubbed into foreign languages for release in areas such as [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], especially for video games that place a heavy emphasis on dialogue. Because characters' mouth movements can be part of the game's code, [[lip sync]] is sometimes achieved by re-coding the mouth movements to match the dialogue in the new language. The [[Source engine]] automatically generates lip-sync data, making it easier for games to be localized.

To achieve synchronization when animations are intended only for the source language, localized content is mostly recorded using techniques borrowed from movie dubbing (such as rythmo band) or, when images are not available, localized dubbing is done using source audios as a reference. Sound-synch is a method where localized audios are recorded matching the length and internal pauses of the source content.&lt;!-- What does this last sentence mean? --&gt;

For the European version of a video game, the on-screen text of the game is available in various languages and, in many cases, the dialogue is dubbed into each respective language, as well.

The North American version of any game is always available in [[English language|English]], with translated text and dubbed dialogue, if necessary, in other languages, especially if the North American version of the game contains the same data as the European version. Several Japanese games, such as those in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'', and ''[[Soul (series)|Soul]]'' series, are released with both the original Japanese audio and the English dub included.

===Television===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Dubbing is occasionally used on [[network television]] broadcasts of films that contain dialogue that the network executives or [[Censorship|censors]] have decided to replace. This is usually done to remove [[profanity]]. In most cases, the original actor does not perform this duty, but an actor with a similar voice reads the changes. The results are sometimes seamless, but, in many cases, the voice of the replacement actor sounds nothing like the original performer, which becomes particularly noticeable when extensive dialogue must be replaced. Also, often easy to notice, is the sudden absence of background sounds in the movie during the dubbed dialogue. Among the films considered notorious for using substitute actors that sound very different from their theatrical counterparts are the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' and the ''[[Die Hard series|Die Hard]]'' film series, as shown on broadcasters such as [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]]. In the case of ''Smokey and the Bandit'', extensive dubbing was done for the first network airing on [[ABC Television]] in 1978, especially for [[Jackie Gleason]]'s character, [[Buford T. Justice]]. The dubbing of his phrase "sombitch" (son of a bitch) became "scum bum," which became a catchphrase of the time.

Dubbing is commonly used in [[science fiction television]], as well. Sound generated by effects equipment such as [[Animatronics|animatronic]] puppets or by actors' movements on elaborate multi-level plywood sets (for example, starship bridges or other command centers) will quite often make the original character dialogue unusable. ''[[Stargate]]'' and ''[[Farscape]]'' are two prime examples where ADR is used heavily to produce usable audio.

Since some anime series contain profanity, the studios recording the English dubs often re-record certain lines if a series or movie is going to be broadcast on [[Cartoon Network]], removing references to [[death]] and [[hell]] as well. Some companies will offer both an edited and an uncut version of the series on DVD, so that there is an edited script available in case the series is broadcast. Other companies also edit the full-length version of a series, meaning that even on the uncut DVD characters say things like "Blast!" and "Darn!" in place of the original dialogue's profanity. [[Bandai|Bandai Entertainment's]] English dub of ''[[G Gundam]]'' is infamous for this, among many other things, with such lines as "Bartender, more milk".

Dubbing has also been used for comedic purposes, replacing lines of dialogue to create comedies from footage that was originally another genre. Examples include the Australian shows ''[[The Late Show (1990s Australian TV series)#The Olden Days|The Olden Days]]'' and ''[[Bargearse]]'', re-dubbed from 1970s Australian drama and action series, respectively, the Irish show ''[[Soupy Norman]]'', re-dubbed from ''[[:pl:Pierwsza miłość|Pierwsza miłość]]'', a Polish soap opera, and ''[[Most Extreme Elimination Challenge]]'', a comedic dub of the Japanese show ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]''.

Dubbing into a foreign language does not always entail the deletion of the original language. In some countries, a performer may read the translated dialogue as a voice-over. This often occurs in [[Russia]] and [[Poland]], where "lektories" or "lektors" read the translated dialogue into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. In Poland, one announcer read all text. However, this is done almost exclusively for the television and home video markets, while theatrical releases are usually subtitled. Recently, however, the number of high-quality, fully dubbed films has increased, especially for children's movies. If a quality dubbed version exists for a film, it is shown in theaters. However, some films, such as ''[[Harry Potter]]'' or ''[[Star Wars]]'', are shown in both dubbed and subtitled versions, varying with the time of the show. Such films are also shown on TV (although some channels drop them and do standard one-narrator translation) and VHS/DVD. In other countries, like [[Vietnam]], the voice-over technique is also used for theatrical releases.&lt;!-- This section and the next one are redundant. This material has already been covered and should be merged above. --&gt;

In Russia, the reading of all lines by a single person is referred to as a [[Gavrilov translation]], and is generally found only in [[Copyright infringement|illegal copies]] of films and on [[cable television]]. Professional copies always include at least two actors of opposite gender translating the dialogue. Some titles in Poland have been dubbed this way, too, but this method lacks public appeal, so it is very rare now.

On special occasions, such as [[film festival]]s, live [[interpreting]] is often done by professionals.

===Pornography===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
As budgets for [[pornographic film]]s are often small, compared to films made by major studios, and there is an inherent need to film without interrupting filming, it is common for sex scenes to be over-dubbed. The audio for such over-dubbing is generally referred to as ''the Ms and Gs'', or ''the moans and groans.''

==Dubbing into dialects==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
In the case of languages with large communities (such as [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or [[French language|French]]), a single translation may sound foreign to native speakers in a given region. Therefore, a film may be translated into a dialect of a certain language. For example, the animated movie ''[[The Incredibles]]'' was translated to [[European Spanish]], [[Mexican Spanish]], [[Neutral Spanish]] (which used the Mexican voice cast), and [[Rioplatense Spanish]] (although people from [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]] noticed a strong ''[[porteño]]'' accent from most of the characters of the Rioplatense Spanish translation). In [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Spanish-speaking regions]], most media is dubbed twice: into Spanish (Spain) and Neutral Spanish (which is Mexican Spanish but avoids colloquialisms).

Another example is the French dialect dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which is entirely different in [[Quebec]] and [[France]], the humor being very different for each audience (see [[Non-English versions of The Simpsons|Non-English versions of ''The Simpsons'']]). Audiences in Quebec are generally critical of France's dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which they often do not find amusing. The French-language [[Télétoon (Canada)|Télétoon]] network once aired the Quebec dub for ''The Simpsons'', as well as Parisian French dubs of ''[[Futurama]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'', which were both similar to the Parisian dub for ''The Simpsons''. The two latter shows have since been taken off the network, while ''The Simpsons'' continues its run on Télétoon.

[[Quebec French]] dubbing of films is generally made in accent-free [[Standard French]] but may sound peculiar to audiences in France because of the persistence of some regionally-neutral expressions and because Quebec French performers pronounce Anglo-Saxon names with an American accent, unlike French performers. Occasionally, cost causes American [[direct-to-video]] films, such as the 1995 film ''When the Bullet Hits the Bone'', to be released in France with a Quebec French dubbing, sometimes resulting in what some members of French audiences perceive as unintentional humor.

[[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]] also use different versions of dubbed films and series. Because dubbing has never been very popular in [[Portugal]], for decades, children's films were distributed using the higher-quality Brazilian dub (unlike children's TV series, which are traditionally dubbed in European Portuguese). Only in the 1990s did dubbing begin to gain importance in Portugal. ''[[The Lion King]]'' became the first Disney feature film to be completely dubbed into [[European Portuguese]] and, subsequently, all major animation films gained European Portuguese versions. In recent [[DVD]] releases, most Brazilian-dubbed classics were released with new Portuguese dubs, eliminating the predominance of Brazilian Portuguese dubs in Portugal.

Similarly, in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking region of [[Flanders]], in [[Belgium]], cartoons are often dubbed locally by [[Flemish]] artists{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}, rather than using soundtracks produced in the [[Netherlands]].

The [[list of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking region]], which includes [[Germany]], [[Austria]], the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]] share a common German-dubbed version. Although there are some differences in German dialects, all films, shows and series are dubbed into a single [[Standard German]] version that avoids regional variations in the German-speaking audience. Most voice actors are primarily [[Germans]] and [[Austrians]] since there has been a long tradition of dubbing films. Switzerland, which has four official languages (German, French, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Romansh language|Romansh]]), generally uses dubbed versions made in each respective country (except for Romansh). Liechtenstein uses German-dubbed versions only.

Sometimes, films are also dubbed into several [[German dialects]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ([[Berlinerisch]], [[Colognian language|Kölsch]], [[Saxonian]], [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]] or [[Swiss German]]), which especially concerns animated films and Disney films. They are made for amusement and as an additional "special feature" to entice the audience into buying it. Popular animated films dubbed into German dialects include ''[[Asterix]]'' films (in addition to its Standard German version, every film has a particular dialect version), ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Shrek 2]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', (+ Austrian German){{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OBS_20090810_OBS0008 |title=Österreich-Version von Disney/Pixars "Oben" mit Otto Schenk und Karlheinz Böhm - BILD |language=de |publisher=ots.at |date=10 August 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (+ Austrian German).

Some live-action films or TV-series have an additional German dialect dubbing: ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanDialects|title=German Dialects / Useful Notes - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2017}} and its sequel, ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'' (German German, Austrian German, Swiss German); and ''[[Rehearsal for Murder]]'', ''[[Framed (TV series)|Framed]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776730&amp;threaded=1&amp;id=506508&amp;message=6643629 |title=Allgemeines " ORF-Synchronisationen - Wer weiß was? |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (+ Austrian German); ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[Serpico]]'', ''[[Rumpole]]'' (+ Austrian German), and ''[[The Thorn Birds]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776728&amp;threaded=1&amp;id=506269&amp;message=7100872 |title=Serien " 24 |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(only Austrian German dubbing).

Before [[German reunification]], [[East Germany]] also made its own particular German version. For example, ''[[Olsen-banden|Olsen Gang]]'' and the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] animated series ''[[The Mézga Family]]'' were dubbed in [[West Germany]] as well as East Germany.

Usually, there are two dubbings produced in dialects of [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]: [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Serbian for [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina]]; Croatian for [[Croatia]] and parts of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

==Criticism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
The many [[martial arts]] movies from [[Hong Kong]] that were imported under the unofficial banner [[Kung Fu Theater]] were notorious for seemingly careless dubbing that included poor lip sync and awkward dialogue. Since the results were frequently unintentionally hilarious, this has become one of the hallmarks that endear these films to part of the 1980s culture.

While the voice actors involved usually bear the brunt of criticisms towards poor dubbing, other factors may include inaccurate script translation and poor [[Audio mixing (television and film)|audio mixing]]. Dialogue typically contains speech patterns and sentence structure that are natural to the language but would appear awkward if translated literally. English dubs of Japanese animation, for example, must rewrite the dialogue so that it flows smoothly and follows the natural pattern of English speech. Voice actors in a dubbing capacity typically do not have the luxury of viewing the original film with the original voice actor and thus have little idea regarding how to perform the role. On some occasions, voice actors record their dialogue separately, which can lack the dynamics gained from performing as a group.

==Life and career==
From 1904 on,&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialhistory.org/bwsa/biografie/schurer Fedde Schurer in the ''Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland'']&lt;/ref&gt; Schurer grew up in the [[Friesland|Frisian]] fishing village of [[Lemmer]],&lt;ref&gt;Fedde Schurer, ''De Besleine Spegel'', Amsterdam (Moussault's Uitgeverij N.V.), 1969, pp. 18–30&lt;/ref&gt; and from a young age worked as a [[carpenter]].&lt;ref&gt;Fedde Schurer, ''De Besleine Spegel'', Amsterdam (Moussault's Uitgeverij N.V.), 1969, pp. 31–41&lt;/ref&gt; Through self-education in the evenings he studied to become a schoolteacher, and in 1919, he was appointed in that position to the local Christian elementary school in Lemmer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialhistory.org/bwsa/biografie/schurer Fedde Schurer in the ''Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland'']&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Willemke "Willy" de Vries, who was also a schoolteacher, and his colleague at this school, he had actually met when he was still a carpenter's apprentice, as she was the girl who delivered the newspaper at the carpenter's workshop everyday.&lt;ref&gt;Fedde Schurer, ''De Besleine Spegel'', Amsterdam (Moussault's Uitgeverij N.V.), 1969, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Schurer and Willy were married on 1 July 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialhistory.org/bwsa/biografie/schurer Fedde Schurer in the ''Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, his openly [[pacifism|pacifist]] stance caused Schurer to lose his job, after which he moved to [[Amsterdam]], where he was appointed to a state-run school.&lt;ref&gt;Fedde Schurer, ''De Besleine Spegel'', Amsterdam (Moussault's Uitgeverij N.V.), 1969, pp. 65–96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialhistory.org/bwsa/biografie/schurer Fedde Schurer in the ''Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland'']&lt;/ref&gt; He was a talented orator, and his pacifist and socialist views were seen as a danger to society at that time, which is why the [[Binnenlandse Veiligheidsdienst|BVD]], the Dutch secret service, started a file om him.&lt;ref&gt;Fedde Schurer, ''De Besleine Spegel'', Amsterdam (Moussault's Uitgeverij N.V.), 1969, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spanvis.nl/Fedde%20Schurer/FeddeSchurer.htm Short biography of Schurer] (below the headline ''Talentvol en gevaarlijk spreker'': "In a BVD file Schurer is seen as "Talented and dangerous orator, especially dangerous to young people.")&lt;/ref&gt; Schurer joined the [[Christian Democratic Union (Netherlands)|Christian-Democratic Union]] (CDU), a Christian-socialist splinter party, and in 1935–1936 he served as a member of the provincial assembly of [[North Holland]] for a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialhistory.org/bwsa/biografie/schurer Fedde Schurer in the ''Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland'']&lt;/ref&gt; In [[World War II]] he was involved with the [[Dutch resistance]] in Amsterdam, where his house was used as a temporary hiding place for people wanted by the [[Nazi]]s, before they could be smuggled out of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Fedde Schurer, ''De Besleine Spegel'', Amsterdam (Moussault's Uitgeverij N.V.), 1969, pp. 126–134&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Schurer returned to Friesland, where he lived in [[Heerenveen]], and worked as a journalist.&lt;ref&gt;Fedde Schurer, ''De Besleine Spegel'', Amsterdam (Moussault's Uitgeverij N.V.), 1969, pp. 148–152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialhistory.org/bwsa/biografie/schurer Fedde Schurer in the ''Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Boomsma, ''Kneppelfreed'', Franeker (Uitgeverij Van Wijnen), 1998, pp. 16–19&lt;/ref&gt; Like most people from Friesland, he was a native [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] speaker, and from a young age he had been an ardent supporter of his mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Fedde Schurer, ''De Besleine Spegel'', Amsterdam (Moussault's Uitgeverij N.V.), 1969, pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt; When in several court cases in Friesland in 1950 and 1951 the judge denied the defendants the right to speak Frisian,&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Boomsma, ''Kneppelfreed'', Franeker (Uitgeverij Van Wijnen), 1998, pp. 24–27, 33/34&lt;/ref&gt; Schurer wrote a sharply worded editorial rebuke in the ''Friese Koerier'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Fedde Schurer, ''De Besleine Spegel'', Amsterdam (Moussault's Uitgeverij N.V.), 1969, pp. 164–166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Boomsma, ''Kneppelfreed'', Franeker (Uitgeverij Van Wijnen), 1998, pp. 34–36&lt;/ref&gt; He was then charged with slandering the judge, and had to appear in court on Friday, 16 November 1951, in the provincial capital of [[Leeuwarden]], together with another journalist, Tsjebbe de Jong, who stood accused of the same offence.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Boomsma, ''Kneppelfreed'', Franeker (Uitgeverij Van Wijnen), 1998, pp. 37/38&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Zaailand square, in front of the Leeuwarden Palace of Justice, a large crowd gathered that day. There were some supporters of Schurer (among them renowned Frisian authors like [[Douwe Tamminga]], [[Anne Wadman]] and [[Eeltsje Boates Folkertsma]]), some Frisian nationalists, members of the Frisian-language [[news media|press]] (who weren't allowed in the court-room) and a group of students carrying plackards, but it happened to be market day that day, and a lot of the people there were simply market goers who came over to see what all the fuss was about.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Boomsma, ''Kneppelfreed'', Franeker (Uitgeverij Van Wijnen), 1998, pp. 44–47&lt;/ref&gt; Through inept crowd control by the police&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Boomsma, ''Kneppelfreed'', Franeker (Uitgeverij Van Wijnen), 1998, pp. 47–49&lt;/ref&gt; the situation got completely out of hand and turned into a riot known as ''Kneppelfreed'' ("Baton Friday", after the batons used by the police).&lt;ref&gt;Fedde Schurer, ''De Besleine Spegel'', Amsterdam (Moussault's Uitgeverij N.V.), 1969, pp. 168–170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Boomsma, ''Kneppelfreed'', Franeker (Uitgeverij Van Wijnen), 1998, pp. 49–53&lt;/ref&gt; Something like this was unheard of in sleepy Dutch post-war society, and the event triggered angry protest meetings throughout Friesland.&lt;ref&gt;Fedde Schurer, ''De Besleine Spegel'', Amsterdam (Moussault's Uitgeverij N.V.), 1969, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Boomsma, ''Kneppelfreed'', Franeker (Uitgeverij Van Wijnen), 1998, pp. 54–60 and 65–68&lt;/ref&gt; The story even made headlines in the foreign press,&lt;ref&gt;Fedde Schurer, ''De Besleine Spegel'', Amsterdam (Moussault's Uitgeverij N.V.), 1969, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; and questions were raised in the ''[[Tweede Kamer]]'', the Dutch lower house of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Boomsma, ''Kneppelfreed'', Franeker (Uitgeverij Van Wijnen), 1998, pp. 68–74&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure to resolve the situation, the national government in [[The Hague]] sent a committee consisting of three ministers to Friesland to confer with the Frisian leaders,&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Boomsma, ''Kneppelfreed'', Franeker (Uitgeverij Van Wijnen), 1998, pp. 76–78&lt;/ref&gt; which eventually led to changes in the national laws (in 1955 and 1956), making it possible for Frisians to speak their own language in the court of law and giving the Frisian language in the Province of Friesland the official status of ''tweede rijkstaal'' ("second national language").&lt;ref&gt;Fedde Schurer, ''De Besleine Spegel'', Amsterdam (Moussault's Uitgeverij N.V.), 1969, pp. 174–183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Boomsma, ''Kneppelfreed'', Franeker (Uitgeverij Van Wijnen), 1998, pp. 99–107&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kneppelfreed'' is considered one of the most important milestones in the emancipation of the West Frisian language.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Boomsma, ''Kneppelfreed'', Franeker (Uitgeverij Van Wijnen), 1998, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

As for Schurer, he lost his case, and after the appeal he had to pay a fine.&lt;ref&gt;Fedde Schurer, ''De Besleine Spegel'', Amsterdam (Moussault's Uitgeverij N.V.), 1969, pp. 163–168 and 171–173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Boomsma, ''Kneppelfreed'', Franeker (Uitgeverij Van Wijnen), 1998, pp. 39–44 and 82–92&lt;/ref&gt; He served from 1956 to 1963 as a member of the Dutch national parliament for the [[Partij van de Arbeid|Dutch Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialhistory.org/bwsa/biografie/schurer Fedde Schurer in the ''Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland'']&lt;/ref&gt; He also continued to win acclaim as a poet.&lt;ref&gt;Klaes Dykstra and Bouke Oldenhof, ''Lyts Hânboek fan de Fryske Literatuer'', Leeuwarden (Afûk), 1997, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although Schurer is known as both a writer and a poet, his body of [[prose]], consisting only of the short story collection ''Beam en Bast'' (1963) and his posthumously published autobiography ''De Besleine Spegel'' (1969), is diminutive when compared to his poetry [[Work of art|oeuvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaes Dykstra and Bouke Oldenhof, ''Lyts Hânboek fan de Fryske Literatuer'', Leeuwarden (Afûk), 1997, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Schurer also wrote two plays, ''Simson'' (1945, about the [[Bible|Biblical]] figure of [[Samson]]), and ''Bonifatius'' (1954, about [[Saint Boniface]]). Active also as a translator, he was responsible for the Frisian text of the ''[[Book of Esther]]'' in the New Frisian Bible Translation, while in 1931 he published a collection of poetry written by [[Heinrich Heine]], which hy had translated into Frisian.&lt;ref&gt;Klaes Dykstra and Bouke Oldenhof, ''Lyts Hânboek fan de Fryske Literatuer'', Leeuwarden (Afûk), 1997, p. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt; Fedde Schurer died in Heerenveen, in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/auteurs/auteur.php?id=schu021 Fedde Schurer in the ''Digitale Bibliotheek voor de Nederlandse Letteren'']&lt;/ref&gt; and was survived by his wife and their adopted son Andries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spanvis.nl/Fedde%20Schurer/FeddeSchurer.htm Biography of Fedde Schurer]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the first comprehensive biography on Schurer was published, titled ''Fedde Schurer (1898–1968): Biografie van een Friese Koerier'', written in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] by Johanneke Liemburg, the mayor of [[Littenseradiel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/news/2010/03/048_liemburg ''Fedde Schurer: Een Doorbraakfiguur'', bulletin of the University of Groningen, 16 March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[property law]], '''''fructus naturales''''' are the natural fruits of the land on which they arise, such as agricultural produce and wild game.  In many [[common law]] legal systems, ''fructus naturales'' are considered to be part of the [[real property]], and not separate chattels in relation to any legal conveyance of the property.

This term originates from the term [[Fructus (Roman law)|fructus naturales]] used in the [[Roman law]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3574">'''Hans Aarnes''' (6 May 1886 &amp;ndash; 25 October 1960) was a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[entrepreneur]], journalist, newspaper editor, magazine editor, [[publisher]] and proponent for the [[Nynorsk language]].

==Early and personal life==

A '''head writer''' is a person who oversees the team of writers on a television or radio series. The title is common in the [[soap opera]] genre, as well as with sketch comedies and talk shows that feature monologues and comedy skits. In prime time series this function is generally performed by an [[executive producer]], who may also be called the [[showrunner]], as in some of the long series that have been produced since the late 20th century in the United States.

==Overview==
The head writer conceives and outlines the long-term story of a scripted television or radio series.

In daytime television, the over-arcing story lines are broken out into daily episodes, which are individually outlined by particular writers, and fleshed out with dialogue by others.

In prime time series, individual staff or freelance writers briefed with any long-term story lines generally pitch their episode ideas to the head writer/executive producer. The writer develops their ideas into an outline and a script, which is subsequently edited and revised by the series' entire writing team during the production process.

Sometimes head writers also hold the role of [[story editor]], though at other times the roles are separate.

==Writing awards==
There are several awards for which a head writer can be eligible for. They include:
*[[Daytime Emmy Awards]]
*[[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]]
*[[Writers Guild Of America Award|WGA Award]]
*[[Gemini Award]]
*[[Satellite Awards]]
*[[Golden Globe Award]]
*[[British Academy Television Awards|BATA]]
*[[TCA Awards]]

==Membership==
Head writers may be members of the following groups: [[Writers Guild of America|WGA]], [[Writers Guild of Canada]], [[Authors Guild]], [[Dramatists Guild of America]], [[American Screenwriters Association]], [[Australian Writers' Guild]], and [[International Affiliation of Writers Guilds]].

The '''ISLRN''' or International Standard Language Resource Number is Persistent Unique Identifier for Language Resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W11-3310 Khalid Choukri, Jungyeul Park, Olivier Hamon, Victoria Arranz, Proposal for the International Standard Language Resource Number. Proceedings of Workshop on Language Resources, Technology and Services in the Sharing Paradigm, Chiang Mai, Thailand, November 12, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
On November 18, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elra.info/en/dissemination/elra-events/elra-nlp12-meeting/paris-declaration/ NLP12 Paris Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt; 12 major organisations (see list below) from the fields Language Resources and Technologies, [[Computational Linguistics]], and [[Digital Humanities]] held a cooperation meeting in Paris (France) and agreed to announce the establishment of the '''International Standard Language Resource Number''' (ISLRN), to be assigned to each Language Resource.

Among the 12 organisations, 4 institutions constitute the ISLRN Steering Committee ('''''ST''''')

* [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations|ADHO]]
* [[Association for Computational Linguistics|ACL]]
* [[AFNLP|Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing]] '''''ST'''''
* COCOSDA, International Committee for the Coordination &amp; Standardisation of Speech Databases and Assessment Techniques
* [[International Committee on Computational Linguistics|ICCL (COLING)]]
* European Data Forum
* [[European Language Resources Association|ELRA]] '''''ST'''''
* [http://www.eamt.org/iamt.php IAMT, International Association for Machine Translation]
* [[International Speech Communication Association|ISCA]]
* [[Linguistic Data Consortium|LDC]] '''''ST'''''
* [www.cocosda.org Oriental COCOSDA] '''''ST'''''
* [http://rma.nwu.ac.za/ RMA, Language Resource Management Agency]

== Size and Content ==
The Joint Research Centre(JRC),&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/language-technologies Joint Research Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; the [European Commission]'s in-house science   service, was the first organisation to adopt the ISLRN initiative and requested. 
2500 resources and tools have already been allocated an ISLRN. These resources include '''written data''' (Annotated corpus, Annotated text, List of misspelled word, Terminological database, Treebank, Wordnet, etc.) and '''speech corpora''' (Synthesised Speech, Transcripts and Audiovisual Recordings, Conversational Speech, Folk Sayings, etc.)

== Objectives ==
Providing Language Resources with unique names and identifiers using a standardized nomenclature ensures the '''identification''' of each Language Resources and streamlines the '''citation''' with proper references in activities within Human [[Language Technology]] as well as in documents and '''scientific publications'''. Such unique identifier also enhances the reproducibility,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2016/workshops/LREC2016Workshop-4REAL_Proceedings.pdf 4REAL Workshop on Research Results Reproducibility, and Resources Citation in Science and Technology of Language]&lt;/ref&gt; an essential feature of scientific work.

'''Izon''' (Ịzọn), also known as (Central–Western) Ijo, Ijaw, Izo and Uzo, is the dominant [[Ijaw language]], spoken by a majority of the [[Ijaw people]] of [[Nigeria]].

There are about thirty dialects, all [[mutually intelligible]], of which the most important are Gbanran, Ekpetiama and Kolokuma. Kolokuma is the language of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/18/language/ijc/|title=Izon|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, the ''Izon Fie'' instructional book and audio CDs were launched at a ceremony attended by officials of the government of [[Bayelsa State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General information/History ==
While there are approximately 1,700,000 speakers of all Ijo languages in Nigeria, it is believed that there are only a little over 1,000,000 Izon speakers. The language is currently classified as "at risk", with a 20% certainty based on the evidence available. Izon is recognized as having been present in the region several millennia before the 15th century when the Portuguese arrived at the Nigerian coast. At present, linguists approximate that the language became established in the Niger Delta region as many as seven to eight thousand years ago.

The Ijo people did not call the Niger Delta region home for all of history; in fact, it is known that there have been ancient movements from far-away places/from the edges of the Niger Delta. Because of this, Izon is closely related to a variety of other languages from surrounding areas, beyond the confines of Nigeria towards the sources of the Niger River near West Africa. Linguists have traced the pre-history of Izon far back and collectively refer to its roots as proto-ijo, the language from which all existing Ijo dialects came into existence.

== Preservation efforts ==
In recent efforts to prevent the Izon language from extinction, the Bayelsa State Government has taken great preservation measures. They have employed over thirty teachers to teach the Izon language in local schools within the state. The Commissioner for Culture and Ijaw National Affairs, Dr. Felix Tuodolo fears that because families are now teaching their children Pidgin-English, as opposed to Izon, that the language is now at critical risk for extinction. As a means of furthering the government's dedication to preserving the cultural language, a number of books have been written in Izon dialects to assist in this process

* The Izon language does not make singular-plural distinctions in verbs, as opposed to what is done in English. Therefore, regardless of whether or not the subject is singular or plural, the same form of the verb is used. Such a system is evident in the following examples:
{| class="wikitable"
!Izon sample sentence
!English translation
|-
|Kiri ma se ke '''u sei''' mini ye.
|'''He dances''' at all times.
|-
|Kiri ma se ke '''a sei''' mini ye.
|'''She dances''' at all times.
|-
|Kiri ma se ke '''wo sei''' mini ye.
|'''We dance''' at all times.
|-
|Kiri ma se ke '''oni sei''' mini ye.
|'''They dance''' at all times.
|}
In each of the four Izon sentences above, the same form of the verb "sei" (dance) is used, even when the plurality of the subject changes.
* Another interesting aspect of Izon Syntax is its Demonstrative Agreement. A variety of demonstratives are used in Izon to indicate the gender of the nouns that coincide with them. The demonstratives "bei" (this) and "u bei" (that) are used with singular-masculine nouns, for instance:
''bei ki.mi. bei'' (this man)                             ''bei owu bei'' (this masquerade)

''u bei ki.mi. bei'' (that man)                          ''u bei owu bei'' (that masquerade)

The demonstrative "ma" (this) and "u ma" (that) coincide with singular feminine nouns as follows:

''ma iyo. ro. arau. ma'' (this woman)             ''u ma iyo. ro. arau. ma'' (that woman)

''ma ere ma'' (this wife)                                 ''u ma ere ma'' (that wife)

In addition, "mi" (this) and "u mi" (that) are used with singular neuter nouns, for example:

''mi ololo mi'' (this bottle)                                 ''u mi  ololo mi'' (that bottle)

''mi bira mi'' (this hand)                                  ''u mi bira mi'' (that hand)

When there is a plural noun present, the demonstrative "ma" (these) and "u ma" (those) are used, regardless of the gender of the noun. This can be seen in the following:

''ma ere abu ma'' (these wives)                      ''u ma ere abu ma'' (those wives)

''ma azuru ma'' (these rooms)                        ''u ma azuru ma'' (those rooms)

''ma akimi ma'' (these men)                            ''u ma akimi ma'' (those men)

== Additional linguistic information ==
Izon can be considered distinct from many other related languages in the region, in the sense that it follows a SOV (subject object verb format, both in simple and complex sentences. Additionally, directional and locative phrases also precede the main verb. Tense marking takes the form of a suffix on the final verb. Location markers and other preposition-like articles are suffixed to the nouns that they relate to. Possessor typically precedes possessed and adjectives precede the nouns they modify.

'''Joan Helene Hambidge''' (born 11 September 1956 in [[Aliwal North]], South Africa) (the English surname notwithstanding), is an Afrikaans poet, [[literary theory|literary theorist]] and academic.  She is a prolific poet in Afrikaans, controversial as a public figure and critic and notorious for her ''out-of-the-closet'' style of writing.  Her theoretic contributions deal mainly with [[Roland Barthes]], [[deconstruction]], [[postmodernism]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[metaphysics]].

==Biography==
Hambidge studied at the [[University of Stellenbosch]] and the [[University of Pretoria]]. She was admitted to a doctorate under [[André Brink|André P. Brink]] at [[Rhodes University]] in 1985. A second doctorate followed ([[University of Cape Town]],2001).&lt;ref name=LitNet2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Scholtz |first1=Hettie |date=29 May 2008  |title=Joan Hambidge (1956) |url=http://www.litnet.co.za/cgi-bin/giga.cgi?cmd=cause_dir_news_item&amp;cause_id=1270&amp;news_id=46159&amp;cat_id=667 |journal=Litnet }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hambidge says she discovered her [[muse]] when she was young, it was while she was a lecturer at the [[University of the North]], [[Limpopo Province]], South Africa, that she started to blossom as a writer.

She was awarded the [[Eugene Marais|Eugène Marais Prize for literature]] for her second volume of poetry, ''Bitterlemoene'' ("Bitter Oranges"), in 1986.&lt;ref name=LitNet2008 /&gt; This prize is one of the most coveted literary prizes in South Africa.  She also won the [[Litera Prize]] as well as the [[Poetry Institute of Africa Prize]] for her poetry.&lt;ref name=LitNet2008 /&gt;

She is currently a professor at the School of Languages and Literature at the [[University of Cape Town]].

===Her major creative works===
Although she writes in [[Afrikaans]], Hambidge has translated some of her poetry into English. Other translations have been done by Jo Nel, fellow poet and close friend [[Johann de Lange]], and [[Charl Cilliers (writer)|Charl JF Cilliers]].  Her work has been published in the [[Netherlands]] and the UK as well as in the US. Having published 26 volumes of poetry up to 2016 she is the most prolific poet in Afrikaans.

Hambidge's interest in [[literary theory]] (especially [[psychoanalysis]] and [[metafiction]]) is reflected in her writing, especially in her fiction. She works with the difference between theory and practice in her novels, ''Judaskus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| language=af | title=Die Houtbeen van St Sergius: Opstelle oor Afrikaanse romans | author=Chris van der Merwe | publisher=African Sun Media, | year=2014 | url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=o3MRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Joan+Hambidge+++Barthes&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5wO6xtczbAhUIvxQKHfQoBNoQ6AEIWjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Joan%20Hambidge%20%20%20Barthes&amp;f=false | page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Judas kiss", 1998) and "Kladboek" (2008). She has also published two theoretical works: ''Postmodernisme'' (1995),&lt;ref name=LitNet2008 /&gt; about [[Roland Barthes]], [[deconstruction]] and [[post-modernism]], and "Psigoanalise en lees" ("Psychoanalysis and reading", 1991), on [[Jacques Lacan]] and reading.

===Other contributions===
Hambidge is a prolific traveller and writes a weekly column for a [[Cape Town]] daily, ''[[Die Burger]]''. She is a critic and columnist for the [[Afrikaans]] literary [[e-zine]] ''Litnet''.

==Literary style==
Hambidge is famous for her [[iconoclastic]] and [[wikt:irreverent|irreverent]] approach to literary traditions in [[Afrikaans]] and cultural [[role model|idol]]s and for her re-examination of previously [[taboo]] subjects.  She is also the first Afrikaans author to have dealt with lesbianism from an insider's point of view.  She imposes a [[humour|humorous]] and [[satire|satirical]] twist on most of the subjects she tackles.&lt;ref name=LitNet2008 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=fr | title=Des femmes écrivent l'Afrique: L'Afrique australe | author=Margaret J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3709">'''Julio Baghy''' (13 January 1891, [[Szeged]] &amp;ndash; 18 March 1967, [[Budapest]]; in Hungarian '''Baghy Gyula''') was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[actor]] and one of the leading authors of the [[Esperanto]] movement. He is the author of several famous [[novels]] but it is particularly in the field of [[poetry]] that he proved his mastery of Esperanto.

== Early life ==
Baghy was born into a theatrical family &amp;mdash; his father was an actor, and his mother a stage [[Prompter (theatre)|prompter]]. He began learning Esperanto in 1911. He started work as an actor and theatre manager, but the [[First World War]] intervened and took him out of his home country for six years.

He was captured and made a [[prisoner of war]] in [[Siberia]]. It was during this time that he began to work for the Esperanto movement, writing poetry and teaching the language to his fellow inmates.

== Literary works ==

=== Books ===
Baghy wrote two books on the subject of captivity in Siberia: ''Viktimoj'' (Victims, 1925), and ''Sur Sanga Tero'' (On Bloody Soil, 1933), republished together as a single volume in 1971. His satirical novel ''Hura!'' (Hooray!, 1930) was somewhat less of a success. Its sequel ''Insulo de Espero'' (Island of Hope) was lost during the war.

His most famous novel ''Printempo en Aŭtuno'' (Spring in Autumn) was written in 1931.

=== Poetry ===
It is however for his poetry that Baghy is best known. His first poems were written during his time of captivity in Siberia. Hitherto those poets such as [[Zamenhof]] who had written in Esperanto were limited by the still young language and apart from [[Antoni Grabowski]], no poet had managed to make a mark on the language.

Baghy's most significant collection of poems was his first: ''Preter la Vivo'' (Beyond Life, published in 1922). Among his more notable collection of poems are ''Pilgrimo'' (Pilgrim, 1926) and ''Vagabondo Kantas'' (The Vagabond Sings, 1933).

In 1966 he produced ''Ĉielarko'' (Rainbow), retelling in verse the [[Folklore|folk tale]]s from twelve different nations. His last collection of poems, ''Aŭtunaj folioj'' (Autumn leaves) was published posthumously in 1970.

== Esperanto movement ==
Returning to Hungary after the war, he became one of the principal teachers of the Esperanto movement, organising newsgroups and literary evenings. In addition to working in his native Hungary, he organised courses in countries such as Estonia, Latvia, the Netherlands and France.

He was one of the principal writers for the Esperanto literary review ''Literatura Mondo'' until 1933.

His works reflect a slogan of his: ''Amo kreas pacon, Paco konservas homecon, Homeco estas plej alta idealismo.'' (Love creates peace, Peace preserves humanity, Humanity is the highest ideal.)

Several of his works were granted awards by the [[Academy of Esperanto]] and a number of his novels have been translated into several languages.

{{Other uses}}
A '''kingmaker''' is a person or group that has great influence on a [[monarchy|royal]] or political succession, without themselves being a viable candidate.  Kingmakers may use political, monetary, religious, and military means to influence the succession. Originally, the term applied to the activities of [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]]—"Warwick the Kingmaker"—during the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455–1487) in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8568319.stm BBC News: "What is a 'kingmaker'?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In game theory==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
{{main article|Kingmaker scenario}}

In [[game theory]], a kingmaker is a player who lacks sufficient resources or position to win at a given game, but possesses enough remaining resources to decide which of the remaining viable players will eventually win.

==Contemporary usage==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
The term "kingmaker", though always unofficial, has tended to gain more importance in places of power struggle—e.g., politics, sports organizations etc. Consequently, bestowal of such a title is looked upon significantly and more often as a means of indirect gratification for individuals wanting to silently dictate the affairs of the organization. The term is also occasionally used in a pejorative sense during elections where a small number of independent political candidate(s) who hold a sizeable sway in the "vote bank" can most likely decide the course of an outcome.

As well as referring to an individual, the term can also be applied to institutions or think tanks whose opinions are held in great regard by the interested organization. The influence of the religious orders like the Roman Catholic Church in running the affairs of the state during medieval times (through the king) is a well-known example. Kingdoms and empires in the Indian sub-continent often relied on their religious heads. Besides religious orders, even countries can fit into this terminology when they can dictate the affairs of the other country (either directly or indirectly). In current political scenarios across the world the term can expand its scope to include powerful [[lobbying]] groups, whose role is often seen as a defining factor on major issues.

Citizens of [[West Africa]]'s constituent [[Monarchy|monarchies]] often use the word ''kingmaker'' to refer to the members of the electoral colleges that choose their sovereigns because they also usually officiate during the coronation rituals and rites of purification, the word in this particular case taking on a literal meaning i.e. a ''Maker'' of the king.

The term "kingmaker" is also used to describe situations in multi-player games where a player is either unable to win or has claimed an unassailable lead, but, in either case, plays a strong role in determining the outcome for other players.

==In fiction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
* The character [[Leon Fortunato]] from the ''[[Left Behind (series)|Left Behind]]'' series of novels is often described as a kingmaker.
* Marcus Jefferson Wall, the antagonist of much of the [[Matador series]] by Steve Perry is called the Kingmaker, and controls the President of the Galactic Federation
* The character [[Mayvar|Mayvar Kingmaker]] from the ''[[Saga of the Exiles]]'' series of novels tests the ability of aspirants before they can be proclaimed king of the [[Saga of Pliocene Exile#Tanu and Firvulag|Tanu]].
* Ser Criston Cole, a character from [[George R.&amp;nbsp;R. Martin]]’s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series, is commonly referred to as "the kingmaker".
* Minato Yoko, a character from [[Kamen Rider Gaim]], considers herself a kingmaker, wanting to see who has what it takes to take the Forbidden Fruit, a fruit of great power that can essentially make a person a king. Likewise, another character, Mitsuzane Kureshima, also has traits of a kingmaker, hanging around with and manipulating events so as to put the ruler in his favor.
* Harry Leong, the ultra-rich, secretive billionaire from ''[[Crazy Rich Asians]]'', is revealed to be one of the kingmakers in the government of Singapore.
* One of the villains in the NBC TV series ''[[The Blacklist (TV series)|The Blacklist]]'' went under the alias ''The Kingmaker''.

His poetry collection ''Meanwhile Take My Hand'' (Graywolf, 2007), translated into English by Elizabeth Macklin, was a finalist for the 2008 PEN Award for Poetry in Translation. His works have been published on several American publications such as ''[[The New Yorker]], [[Open City (magazine)|Open City]]'' or ''[[Little Star Journal|Little Star]]''.

==Early life==
Kirmen Uribe was born in Ondarroa (Basque Country), a small fishing town about one hour from Bilbao. Uribe's father (who died in 1999) was a [[Fishing trawler|trawler]]man and his mother was a homemaker. He studied Basque Philology at the University of the Basque Country–Gasteiz, and did his graduate studies in Comparative Literature in Trento, Italy. He won his first literary prize in 1995 while he was in jail for being conscientious objector and refusing to go to compulsory military service.

==Career==

===Poetry and multimedia===
The critic Jon Kortazar has said that the appearance of Kirmen Uribe's poetry collection ''Bitartean heldu eskutik'' (''Meanwhile Take My Hand''), published by Susa in 2001, was a "peaceful revolution" in the world of Basque literature. It received the Critics Prize for poetry written in Basque, and its first edition sold out within a month. The book has since been translated into Spanish (Visor, 2003), French (Castor Astral, 2006), English (Graywolf, 2007), Catalan (Proa, 2010) and Russian (Издательство Герника, 2010). The U.S.-born writer Elizabeth Macklin translated it into English directly from Basque, and this would be the first time a book translated directly from Basque was published by a commercial press in the United States of America. ''Meanwhile Take My Hand'' was a finalist for the 2008 PEN Award for Poetry in Translation, which recognizes the best book of poetry in translation published in the United States in the previous year.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Uribe has taken part in a number of onstage performances combining literature with other arts. In 2000, with musician Mikel Urdangarin and filmmaker Josu Eizagirre, he began work on ''Bar Puerto'', which united poetry, music, video and oral history onstage, to recount the life experiences of the residents of an old neighborhood that was torn down to build a highway in Uribe's home town. In the fall of 2003, in collaboration with musicians Urdangarin, Bingen Mendizabal and Rafa Rueda and artist Mikel Valverde, Uribe published the CD-book ''Zaharregia, txikiegia agian'' ("too old, too small, maybe"; published by Gaztelupeko Hotsak), which was the outcome of a half dozen readings-with-music the group had done in New York earlier that year; the question in its title refers to the Basque language, whether our language might not be too old and too small for our globalized times.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===''Bilbao-New York-Bilbao''===
In 2008 Uribe published his first novel, ''Bilbao–New York–Bilbao'' (Elkar). The book sparked great curiosity. It received the Critics' Prize and the Spanish Literature Prize for Narrative. In early 2010 it was brought out simultaneously in Spanish (Seix-Barral), Galician (Xerais) and Catalan (Edicions 62). The novel ''Bilbao–New York–Bilbao'' is set on a hypothetical flight that its narrator, one Kirmen Uribe, takes from Bilbao's Loiu Airport to New York's J.F.K. On the flight the writer contemplates his supposed novel-in-progress, which is about three generations of a family, his own, whose life is bound up with the sea. Bilbao–New York–Bilbao is a novel with no conventional plot to speak of. Its structure is that of a net, and the knots of the net are the stories of the three generations as they intersect with crosswise stories and reflections on the twentieth century as it was experienced in the Basque Country. Ollie Brock wrote about the novel in ''The Times Literary Supplement'' in August 2011: "Uribe has succeeded in realizing what is surely an ambition for many writers: a book that combines family, romances and literature, anchored deeply in a spoken culture but also in bookishness —and all without a single note of self-congratulation".

===''Mussche''===
His second novel, ''Mussche'' (Susa, 2013), translated into Spanish as ''Lo que mueve el mundo'' (Seix Barral) is a docu-fictional novel that tells the story of one the thousands of Basque children who left the port of Bilbao way to exile in May 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, after the bombing of Guernica. Carmen, a girl of eight years, was hosted in the home of a poet and translator (Robert Mussche) in Ghent, Belgium. The writer’s life changes with the arrival of the child and, gradually, the events lead to an unexpected ending. “A thrilling novel from the first line to the last. The vicissitudes of the young Belgian writer related to Basque war children, is a narrative tense, exemplary in its structure and that oozes authenticity” reviewed César Coca (El Correo).  The novel shows the cruelty and absurdity of war to some extent, and it is recognized as a great work on the subject of anti-war. The Japanese translation, by Kaneko Nami, was awarded as the best translation of 2015 in Japan.

===''The Hour of Waking Together''===
His last novel, ''Elkarrekin esnatzeko ordua'' (Susa, 2016), continues in the recovery of forgotten lives to make fiction. Tells the life of Karmele Urresti, a Basque nurse who exiles to Paris in 1937, where she becomes involved with the Basque Cultural Embassy. It is there she meets her future husband, the musician Txomin Letamendi. Together they travel Europe, but when they know that Paris has fallen to the Germans, they flee to Venezuela. In Venezuela History gets again in their lives. Txomin decides to join the Basque secret services (under the command of the American intelligence, the OSS and FBI) and so the family goes back to Europe, just in the middle of World War II. He spies the Nazis until he gets arrested in Barcelona, under a dictatorship he won’t survive. Karmele will have to risk everything and part, again and alone, to Venezuela.
JA Masoliver Ródenas wrote in La Vanguardia about the novel: «The direct and precise prose of Kirmen Uribe doesn’t have to fool us: it’s fruit of accuracy, not simplicity. His background is that of a cosmopolitan and sophisticated writer. (…) A writer of great and real talent.» The novel was simultaneously published in Basque (Susa), Spanish (Seix Barral) and Catalan (Edicions 62) and won 2016 Spanish Critic’s Award (Narrative in Basque) and 2016 Basque Readers Academy Award (Best Book of 2016).

===On the international scene===
He has participated in a number of international literary festivals including: New York’s PEN World Voices Festival, the Berlin International Poetry Festival, Tai Pei International Poetry Festival and Medellin International Poetry Festival. He has given lectures and led seminars at Stanford, Brown, New York University, University of Chicago, Ohio State, California Institute of the Arts, University of California-San Diego and the University of Foreign Studies of Tokyo, among others.

His poems have appeared in renowned periodicals and international anthologies. In May 2003 The New Yorker magazine published his poem "May." Since then his work has appeared in other U.S. journals as well. In 2006, the Berlin online magazine Lyrikline published a selection of ten of his poems in German translation; it was the first time that journal of international poetry had ever published work by a Basque writer. In 2008, the American literary critics Kevin Prufer and Wayne Millar included three of Uribe's poems in their New European Poets anthology. The Harvard Book Review has said of him, "Uribe's voice speaks across cultures…. His poems may be rooted [in the Basque Country], but they bloom outwards."{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 2017 he was selected for the International Writers Program (IWP) in Iowa City.

'''Kota''' is a language of the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language family]] with about 9000 native speakers in the [[Nilgiri hills]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] state, [[India]]. It is spoken mainly by the tribal [[Kota people (India)|Kota people]]. In the late 19th century, the native speaking population was about 1,100.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, Robert. 1875.  A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Or South-Indian Family of Languages. London: Trübner &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the population was only 930, out of an ethnic population of perhaps 1,400, despite the great increase in the population of the area.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;  The language is 'critically endangered' due to the greater social status of neighbouring languages.&lt;ref&gt;Prema, S. n.d. "Status of Dravidian Tribal Languages in Kerala" University of Kerala&lt;/ref&gt; The Kota language may have originated from [[Old Kannada]] and is closely related to [[Toda language|Toda]]. The Kota population is about 2500. The origin of the name Kota is derived from the Dravida root word 'Ko' meaning Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hellomyexpert.com/breekschatter/summer2012/2012/06/30/the-kotas-jamuna-raju-89/|title=The Kota Tribes of Nilgiris|last=Raju|first=Jamuna|date=30 June 2012|website=Breeks Chatter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yhXRDSgBuL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=kota&amp;f=false|title=History of Kannada Language|last=Narasimhacharya|first=R.|publisher=Asian Educational Services|year=1990|isbn=9788120605596|location=New Delhi, Madras|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of available epics in the [[Kannada language]]''' (also called ''[[purana]]'', in prose or poem), a South Indian [[Dravidian language]]. Based on his research, the Kannada scholar L.S. Sheshagiri Rao claims that starting with the earliest available epic ''Adipurana'' by Pampa (941 C.E), Kannada writers have created a rich and active epic tradition. S.S. Bhusanurematha's ''Bhavyamanava'' (1983) is the latest in that tradition.&lt;ref name="epic"&gt;Rao in Datta (1988), pp1180-1183, chapter-Epic(Kannada)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on medieval Kannada literary sources, the Indologist [[A. K. Warder|Anthony Warder]] claims there were Kannada versions of the ''Ramayana'' and ''Mahabharata'' prior to 941 C.E., and ''Kavya'' (or ''Mahakavya'', epic poems) such as ''Karnataka Kumarasambhava'' by [[Asaga]] (c. 850).&lt;ref name="warder"&gt;Warder (1988), p240, pp247-248&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Kannada scholar R. Narasimhacharya, ''Chandraprabhapurana'' by Sri Vijaya, (court poet of King [[Amoghavarsha I]]) dates to the early 9th century.&lt;ref name="adi1"/&gt;  This list is by no means exhaustive. In addition to the epics listed here, there are numerous epics written 'in part' (called ''khanda'' or ''mahatmaya'') starting with the part rendering of the ''Skanda-purana'' by Kumarapadmarasa in c. 1180.&lt;ref name="mahata"&gt;Parameshwaranand (2001), vol 4 (M-R), pp1059-1074, p1061&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rao,

{{cquote| 
Though it followed the Sanskrit tradition of the ''Mahakavya'' and drew its material from Sanskrit works, even in the earliest stages, the Kannada epic was neither derivative nor imitative. It has developed the [[Valmiki]] and the [[Vyasa]] traditions in its own distinctive ways, and has, in the [[Jainism|Jain]] and [[Lingayat|Virashaiva]] epics, presented new pictures of human greatness and destiny. In the pre-modern period, Kannada produced at least two works - ''Pampa Bharata'' and ''Kumaravyasa Bharata'' - which can rank among the epics of the world.&lt;ref name="rank"&gt;Rao in Datta (1988), p1183&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John William Colenso by Samuel Sidley.jpg|thumb|John William Colenso by Samuel Sidley, 1866. Oil on canvas. National Portrait Gallery, London.]]
'''Magema Magwaza Fuze''' (c. 1840–1922) was the author of ''Abantu Abamnyama Lapa Bavela Ngakona'' (''The Black People and Whence They Came''), the first book in the [[Zulu language]] published by a native speaker of the language.

Born in [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]], he was brought up from about 12 years of age by Bishop [[John William Colenso]] and converted to Christianity. Following his education at the mission, he trained as a printer and compositor on Colenso's press before starting his own printing business. He wrote for a number of Zulu newspapers and in 1896 travelled to the island of Saint Helena to be the secretary to [[Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo]], king of the Zulus, returning to Natal in 1898.

''Abantu Abamnyama'' was published in 1922 and in an English translation in 1979. It has been described as one of the principal sources of Zulu history.

== Early life ==
Magema Magwaza Fuze was born near present day [[Pietermaritzburg]] in Zululand around 1840 to Magwaza, son of Matomela, son of Thoko. The amaFuze were a sub-clan of the amaNgcobo. Nothing is known of his mother. His birth name was Manawami but he was given the nickname Skelemu, derived from the Afrikans word ''skelm'' for rascal or trickster. He told his parents that he would not be raised at home but would work for an important white man.&lt;ref name="oxf" /&gt;

Fuze was raised from the age of about 12 by John William Colenso, the first Bishop of Natal. His year of birth was estimated by Colenso on the basis that Fuze was about 12 years old when he first met him. Colenso converted him to Christianity and baptised him in 1859, giving him the Zulu name Magema. Colenso never gave his converts English or Biblical names. He was educated at the Ekukhanyeni ("place of enlightenment") mission station.&lt;ref name="oxf" /&gt;&lt;ref name=camp&gt;[http://campbell.ukzn.ac.za/?q=taxonomy/term/358 Fuze, Magema Magwaza Papers.] Campbell Collections, University of KwaZulu-Natal. Retrieved 2 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In the 1850s, Fuze trained as a printing compositor on Bishop Colenso's printing press. He was writing in Zulu from a young age and chose to write only in that language. His first piece was an essay describing the daily activities at Ekukhanyeni. Another early piece was an account of day to day dialogue in Zulu, ''Amazwi Abantu'' (''The People's Voices''). He first appeared in print in J. W. Colenso's, ''Three Native Accounts'' (1860) telling his experience of Colenso's visit to [[King Mpande]] in 1859.&lt;ref name=oxf /&gt;

He printed Bibles using the press at Ekukhanyeni during Colenso's trips to England and eventually set up his own printing business in Pietermaritzburg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jonathan A. |last=Draper |chapter=The Bishop and the Bricoleur: Bishop John William Colenso's ''Commentary on Romans'' and Magema Kamagwaza Fuze's ''The Black People and Whence they Came'' |title=The Bible in Africa: Transactions, Trajectories, and Trends |publisher=Brill |location=Gerald O.

He also wrote letters to and articles for newspapers such as ''[[Ilanga lase Natal]]'' and ''[[Ipepo Lo Hlanga]]''.&lt;ref name=oxf /&gt;

In 1896 he travelled to the island of [[Saint Helena]] to be the secretary to [[Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo]], king of the Zulus, who was in exile on the island after leading a rebellion.&lt;ref name=camp /&gt; While on the island he entered into a correspondence with [[Alice Werner]] of the [[School of Oriental Studies]].&lt;ref name=oxf /&gt; He returned to [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] with Dinuzulu on the [[SS Umbilo|SS ''Umbilo'']], early in 1898.&lt;ref name=camp /&gt;

Some time after 1900 Fuze wrote ''Abantu Abamnyama Lapa Bavela Ngakona'' at the request of the readers of his journalism, but it was not immediately published due to lack of money. It was published privately in 1922, making Fuze the first native Zulu-speaker to publish a book in the language.&lt;ref name=oxf /&gt;&lt;ref name=camp /&gt; It was reviewed by Alice Werner in the ''[[Journal of the African Society]]'', one of the few reviews given to it at the time, but not until 1931.&lt;ref&gt;"Some Native Writers in South Africa" by Alice Werner, ''Journal of the African Society'', Vol. 30, No. 118 (1931), pp. 27–39.&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in English in 1979 by the [[University of Natal Press]] in the [[Killie Campbell Africana Library]] as ''The Black People and Whence They Came: A Zulu View'' in a translation by [[Harry Camp Lugg]] edited by professor [[Anthony Trevor Cope|Trevor Cope]].&lt;ref name=camp /&gt;

[[Hlonipha Mokoena]] of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] describes the book as significant not just for its use of the Zulu language and its historical content which makes it one of the principal sources of Zulu history, but as an example of the work of one of the group of mission-educated converts to Christianity known in South Africa as the ''amakhowla'' (believers) who marked the transition from an [[oral tradition]] to a literate culture.&lt;ref name=oxf /&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
Fuze died in 1922.&lt;ref name="oxf"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA403 "Fuze, Magema"] by Hlonipha Mokoena in {{cite book|author=[[Emmanuel Kwaku Akyeampong]] &amp; [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] (Eds.)|title=Dictionary of African Biography|url=|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press.

'''''Milieu intérieur''''' or interior [[:wikt:milieu|milieu]], from the [[French language|French]], ''milieu intérieur'' (the internal environment), is a phrase coined by [[Claude Bernard]] to refer to the [[Extracellular fluid|extra-cellular fluid environment]], more particularly the [[interstitial fluid]], and its [[physiology|physiological]] capacity to ensure protective stability for the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] of [[multicellular organism]].

==Origin==

[[Claude Bernard]] used the phrase in several works from 1854 until his death in 1878. He most likely adopted it from the histologist [[Charles-Philippe Robin|Charles Robin]], who had employed the phrase "milieu de l’intérieur" as a synonym for the ancient [[Hippocrates|hippocratic]] idea of [[humors]]. Bernard was initially only concerned with the role of the blood but he later included that of the whole body in ensuring this internal stability.&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;Gross, C. G. (1998) [http://www.princeton.edu/~cggross/Neuroscientist_98_Bernard.pdf "Claude Bernard and the constancy of the internal environment"] Neuroscientist 4: 380–385 [http://nro.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/4/5/380].&lt;/ref&gt; He summed up his idea as follows:

{{quote|The fixity of the milieu supposes a perfection of the organism such that the external variations are at each instant compensated for and equilibrated.... All of the vital mechanisms, however varied they may be, have always one goal, to maintain the uniformity of the conditions of life in the internal environment.... The stability of the internal environment is the condition for the free and independent life.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, C. (1974) ''Lectures on the phenomena common to animals and plants.'' Trans Hoff HE, Guillemin R, Guillemin L, Springfield (IL): Charles C Thomas {{ISBN|978-0-398-02857-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bernard's work regarding the internal environment of regulation was supported by work in Germany at the same time. While Rudolf Virchow placed the focus on the cell, others, such as Carl von Rokitansky (1804–1878) continued to study humoral pathology particularly the matter of microcirculation. Von Rokitansky suggested that illness originated in damage to this vital microcirculation or internal system of communication. Hans Eppinger Jr. (1879–1946), a professor of internal medicine in Vienna, further
developed von Rokitansky's point of view and showed that every
cell requires a suitable environment which he called the [[ground substance]] for 
successful microcirculation. This work of German scientists was continued in the 20th century by Alfred Pischinger (1899–1982) who defined the connections between the ground substance or extracellular matrix and both the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems and saw therein a complex system of regulation for the body as a whole and for cellular functioning, which he termed the ground regulatory system (''das System der Grundregulation'').&lt;ref name=Pischinger&gt;{{cite book|last=Pischinger|first=Alfred|title=The Extracellular Matrix and Ground Regulation|year=2007|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley|isbn=1-55643-688-2|pages=Foreword by Hartmut Heine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reception==

Bernard’s idea was initially ignored in the 19th century. This happened in spite of Bernard being highly honored as the founder of modern physiology (he indeed received the first [[france|French]] state funeral for a scientist). Even the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica]] does not mention it. His ideas about milieu intérieur only became central to the understanding of physiology in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt; It was only with [[Joseph Barcroft]], [[Lawrence J. Henderson]], and particularly [[Walter Cannon]] and his idea of [[homeostasis]], that it received its present recognition and status.&lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cross | first1 = S. T. | last2 = Albury | first2 = W. R. | year = 1987 | title = Walter B. Cannon, L. J. Henderson, and the Organic Analogy | url = | journal = Osiris | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 165–192 [175] | doi = 10.1086/368665 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current 15th edition notes it as being Bernard's most important idea.

==Conceptual development==

Bernard created his concept to replace the ancient idea of [[Vitalism|life forces]] with that of a mechanistic process in which the body's physiology was regulated through multiple mechanical equilibrium adjustment feedbacks.&lt;ref name="Cross"/&gt; Walter Cannon's later notion of homeostasis (while also mechanistic) lacked this concern, and was even advocated in the context of such ancient notions as [[vis medicatrix naturae]].&lt;ref name="Cross"/&gt;

Cannon, in contrast to Bernard, saw the self-regulation of the body as a requirement for the evolutionary emergence and exercise of intelligence, and further placed the idea in a political context: "What corresponds in a nation to the internal environment of the body? The closest analogue appears to be the whole intricate system of production and distribution of merchandise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cannon | first1 = W. B | year = 1941 | title = The Body Physiologic and the Body Politic | journal = Science | volume = 93 | issue = | pages = 1–10 | jstor=1668231 | doi=10.1126/science.93.2401.1|bibcode = 1941Sci....93....1C }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested, as an analogy to the body's own ability to ensure internal stability, that society should preserve itself with a technocratic bureaucracy, "biocracy".&lt;ref name="Cross"/&gt;

The idea of milieu intérieur, it has been noted, led [[Norbert Wiener]] to the notion of [[cybernetics]] and [[negative feedback]] creating self-regulation in the [[nervous system]] and in nonliving machines, and that "today, cybernetics, a formalization of Bernard’s constancy hypothesis, is viewed as one of the critical antecedents of contemporary cognitive science".&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt;

=== Idea of internal communication ===

In addition to providing the basis for understanding the internal physiology in terms of the interdependence of the cellular and extracellular matrix or ground system, Bernard's fruitful concept of the milieu intérieur has also led to significant research regarding the system of communication that allows for the complex dynamics of homeostasis.

==== Work by Szent-Györgyi ====
Initial work was conducted by Albert Szent-Györgyi who concluded that organic communication could not be explained solely by the random collisions of molecules and studied energy fields as well as the connective tissue. He was aware of earlier work by Moglich and Schon (1938)&lt;ref name=Moglich&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moglich,|first=F.|author2=Schon, M.|title=Energy of vibration in crystals and molecular complexes|journal=Naturwissenschaften|year=1938|volume=26|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jordan (1938)&lt;ref name=Jordan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=P.|title=The physical structure of organic giant molecules|journal=Naturwissenschaften|year=1938|volume=26|pages=693–694|bibcode = 1938NW.....26..693J |doi = 10.1007/BF01606595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on non-electrolytic mechanisms of charge transfer in living systems. This was further explored and advanced by Szent-Györgyi in 1941 in a Koranyi Memorical Lecture in Budapest, published in both ''Science'' and ''Nature'', wherein he proposed that proteins are semi-conductors and capable of rapid transfer of free electrons within an organism. This idea was received with skepticism, but it is now generally accepted that most if not all parts of the extracellular matrix have semiconductor properties.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=F.|author2=Postow, E.|title=Semiconduction in proteins and lipids – its possible biological import|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=1969|volume=158|pages=161–190|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1969.tb56221.x|bibcode = 1969NYASA.158..161R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gutman 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutman, F.,|first=Lyons, L.E.|title=Organic Semiconductors|year=1981|publisher=Krieger|location=Malabar, FL|pages=Part A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Koranyi Lecture triggered a growing molecular-electronics industry, using biomolecular semiconductors in nanoelectronic circuits.

In 1988 Szent-Györgyi stated that "Molecules do not have to touch each other to interact. Energy can flow through... the electromagnetic field" which "along with water, forms the matrix of life." This water is related also to the surfaces of proteins, DNA and all living molecules in the matrix. This is a structured water that provides stability for metabolic functioning, and related to collagen as well, the major protein in the extracellular matrix&lt;ref name=Cameron&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cameron|first=I.L.|title=Verification of simple hydration/dehydration methods to characterize multiple water compartments on Tendon Type 1 Collagen|journal=Cell Biology International|year=2007|volume=31|issue=6|pages=531–539|doi=10.1016/j.cellbi.2006.11.020|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in DNA.&lt;ref name=Corongiu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corongiu|first=G.|author2=Clementi, E.|title=Simulations of the solvent structure for macromolecules.

==== Work in Germany ====

Work in Germany over the last half-century has also focused on the internal communication system, in particular as it relates to the ground system. This work has led to their characterization of the ground system or extracellular matrix interaction with the cellular system as a 'ground regulatory system', seeing therein the key to homeostasis, a body-wide communication and support system, vital to all functions.&lt;ref name=Pischinger /&gt;

In 1953 a German doctor and scientist, Reinhold Voll, discovered that points used in acupuncture had different electrical properties from the surrounding skin, namely a lower resistance. Voll further discovered that the measurement of the resistances at the points gave valuable indications as to the state of the internal organs. Further research was done by Dr. Alfred Pischinger, the originator of the concept of the 'system of ground regulation', as well as Drs. Helmut Schimmel, and Hartmut Heine, using Voll's method of electro-dermal screening. This further research revealed that the gene is not so much the controller but the repository of blueprints on how cells and higher systems should operate, and that the actual regulation of biological activities (see [[Epigenetic cellular biology]]) lies in a 'system of ground regulation'. This system is built on the ground substance, a complex connective tissue between all the cells, often also called the extra-cellular matrix. This ground substance is made up of 'amorphous' and 'structural' ground substance. The former is "a transparent, half-fluid gel produced and sustained by the fibroblast cells of the connective tissues" consisting of highly polymerized sugar-protein complexes.&lt;ref name=Frost&gt;{{cite book|last=Frost|first=Robert|title=Applied Kinesiology: A Training Manual and Reference Book of Basic Principles and Practices|year=2002|publisher=North Atlantic Books|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Applied_Kinesiology.html?id=Bl0BQvU6EfQC&amp;redir_esc=y}}{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground substance, according to German research, determines what enters and exits the cell and maintains homeostasis, which requires a rapid communication system to respond to complex signals(see also [[Bruce Lipton]]).

:This is made possible by the diversity of molecular structures of the sugar polymers of the ground substance, the ability to swiftly generate new such substances, and their high interconnectedness. This creates a redundance that makes possible the controlled oscillation of values above and below the dynamic homeostasis present in all living creatures. This is a kind of fast-responding, "short term memory" of the ground substance. Without this labile capacity, the system would quickly move to an energetic equilibrium, which would bring inactivity and death.&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt;

:For its biochemical survival, every organism requires the ability to rapidly construct, destroy and reconstruct the constituents of the ground substance.&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt;

Between the molecules that make up the ground substance there are minimal surfaces of potential energy. The charging and discharging of the materials of the ground substance cause 'biofield oscillations' (photon fields). The interference of these fields creates short lived (from 10–9 to up to 10–5 seconds) tunnels through the ground substance. 
:Through these tunnels, shaped like the hole through a donut, large chemicals may traverse from capillaries through the ground substance and into the functional cells of organs and back again. All metabolic processes depend upon this transport mechanism.&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt;

Major ordering energy structures in the body are created by the ground substance, such as collagen, which not only conducts energy but generates it, due to its piezoelectric properties.

:Like quartz crystal, collagen in the ground substance and the more stable connective tissues (fascia, tendons, bones, etc.). transforms mechanical energy (pressure, torsion, stretch) into electromagnetic energy, which then resonates through the ground substance (Athenstaedt, 1974). However, if the ground substance is chemically imbalanced, the energy resonating through the body loses coherence.&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt;

This is what occurs in the adaptation response described by [[Hans Selye]]. When the ground regulation is out of balance, the probability of chronic illness increases. Research by Heine indicates that unresolved emotional traumas release a neurotransmitter substance P which causes the collagen to take on a hexagonal structure that is more ordered than their usual structure, putting the ground substance out of balance, what he calls an "emotional scar"providing "an important scientific verification that diseases can have psychological causes."&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt; (see also [[Bruce Lipton]])

==== Work in the U.S. ====
While the initial work on identifying the importance of the ground regulatory system was done in Germany, more recent work examining the implications of inter and intra-cellular communication via the extra-cellular matrix has taken place in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Structural continuity between extracellular, cyst skeletal and nuclear components was discussed by Hay,&lt;ref name=Hay&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hay|first=E.D.|title=Extracellular Matrix|journal=Journal of Cell Biology|year=1981|volume=91|pages=205s–223s|doi=10.1083/jcb.91.3.205s|pmc=2112832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berezny et al.&lt;ref name=Berenzey&gt;{{cite book|last=Berezney|first=R.|title=Nuclear Matrix and DNA Replication in Maul, GG (ed.) The Nuclear Envelope and the Nuclear Matrix|year=1982|publisher=Alan R. Liss|location=New York|pages=183–197|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oschman.&lt;ref name="Oschman 1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oschman|first=J.L.|title=Structure and properties of ground substances|journal=American Zoologist|volume=24|pages=199–215|doi=10.1093/icb/24.1.199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, these elements have been referred to as ground substances, and because of their continuity, they act to form a complex, interlaced system that reaches into and contacts every part of the body. Even as early as 1851 it was recognized that the nerve and blood systems do not directly connect to the cell, but are mediated by and through an extracellular matrix.&lt;ref name="Oschman 2008b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oschman|first=J.L.|title=Mitochondria and cellular aging|journal=Preparation for Anti-Aging Medical Therapeutics|year=2008|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Recent research regarding the electrical charges of the various glycol-protein components of the extracellular matrix shows that because of the high density of negative charges on glycosaminoglycans (provided by sulfate and carboxylate groups of the uronic acid residues) the matrix is an extensive redox system capable of absorbing and donating electrons at any point.&lt;ref name=Levine&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=S.A.|author2=Kidd, M.P.|title=Antioxidant Adaptation: Its Role in Free Radical Pathology|journal=Biocurrent Division, San Leandro, CA|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; This electron transfer function reaches into the interiors of cells as the cytoplasmic matrix is also strongly negatively charged.&lt;ref name=Ling&gt;{{cite book|last=Ling|first=G.N.|title=A Physical Theory of the Living State: The Association-Induction Hypothesis|year=1962|publisher=Blaisdell|location=New York|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire extracellular and cellular matrix functions as a biophysical storage system or accumulator for electrical charge.
 
From thermodynamic, energetic and geometrical considerations, molecules of the ground substance are considered to form minimal physical and electrical surfaces, such that, based on the mathematics of minimal surfaces, minuscule changes can lead to significant changes in distant areas of the ground substance.&lt;ref name=Karcher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karcher|first=H.|author2=Polthier, K.|title=Die geometrie von Minimalfachen|journal=Spektrum der Wissenschaft|year=1990|volume=10|pages=96–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery is seen as having implications for many physiological and biochemical processes, including membrane transport, antigen–antibody interactions, protein synthesis, oxidation reactions, actin–myosin interactions, sol to gel transformations in polysaccharides.&lt;ref name=Andersson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersson|first=S.|title=Minimal surfaces and structures: from inorganic and metal crystals to cell membranes and biopolymers|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=1988|volume=88|pages=221–242|doi=10.1021/cr00083a011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pienta and Coffey (1991) published "Cellular harmonic information transfer through a tissue tensegrity-matrix system" combining the concepts of the living matrix, vibratory and resonant interactions, cellular and tissue continuity, piezoelectricity, solid-state biochemistry, coherence, and tensegrity – all creating a body-wide communication and regulatory system of living organisms.&lt;ref name=Pienta&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pienta|first=K.J.|author2=Coffey, D.S.|title=Cellular harmonic information transfer through a tissue tensegrity-matrix system|journal=Medical Hypotheses|year=1991|volume=34|pages=88–95|doi=10.1016/0306-9877(91)90072-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One description of the charge transfer process in the matrix is, "highly vectoral electron transport along biopolymer pathways".&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=T.J.|title=Electronic processes in biology|journal=Physics in Medicine and Biology|year=1982|volume=27|issue=3|pages=335–352|doi=10.1088/0031-9155/27/3/001|bibcode = 1982PMB....27..335L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mechanisms involve clouds of negative charge created around the proteoglycans in the matrix. There are also soluble and mobile charge transfer complexes in cells and tissues (e.g. Slifkin, 1971;&lt;ref name=Slifkin&gt;{{cite book|last=Slifkin|first=M.A.|title=Charge transfer Interactions of Biomolecules|year=1971|publisher=Academic Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutman, 1978;&lt;ref name=Gutman&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutman|first=V.|title=The Donor-Acceptor Approach to Molecular Interactions|year=1978|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mattay, 1994&lt;ref name=Mattay&gt;{{cite book|last=Mattay|first=J. (Ed.)|title=Electron Transfer|year=1994|publisher=I. Springer|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Rudolph A. Marcus of the California Institute of Technology found that when the driving force increases beyond a certain level, electron transfer will begin to slow down instead of speed up (Marcus, 1992)&lt;ref name=Marcus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marcus|first=R.A.|title=Electron transfer reactions in chemistry: theory and experiment|journal=Nobel Committee|date=8 December 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and he received a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1992 for this contribution to the theory of electron transfer reactions in chemical systems. The implication of the work is that a vectoral electron transport process may be greater the smaller the potential, as in living systems.

'''Moneybomb''' (alternatively '''money bomb''', '''money-bomb''', or '''fundraising bomb''') is a [[neologism]] coined in 2007 to describe a [[grassroots fundraising]] effort over a brief fixed time period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ron Paul, Gone But Not Forgotten, Could Teach The Media a Lesson |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/industries/media/article/ron-paul-gone-forgotten-teach-media-lesson_548653_15.html |author=Friedman, Jon |publisher=[[Fox Business]] |work=[[MarketWatch]] |date=2008-04-04 |accessdate=2008-04-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407192516/http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/industries/media/article/ron-paul-gone-forgotten-teach-media-lesson_548653_15.html |archivedate=April 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually to support a candidate for election by dramatically increasing, concentrating, and publicizing [[campaign finance|fundraising activity]] during a specific hour or day.

==Effectiveness==
[[Image:MoneybombFlag.jpg|thumb|Moneybomb advertising often makes use of inverted political messages,&lt;ref name=tnr/&gt; as in the case of ads for [[Ron Paul]] (pictured)]]
Political consultant [[Ed Rollins]] said of the moneybomb concept, "I'll tell you, I've been in politics for 40 years, and these days everything I've learned about politics is totally irrelevant because there's this uncontrollable thing like the Internet. Washington insiders don't know what to make of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2007/11/06/post_184.html|author=Vargas, Jose Antonio|publisher=The Washington Post|work=The Trail|title=Paul's Money-Bomb Throwers|date=2007-11-06|accessdate=2007-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 [[Federal Election Commission]] ruling, exempting most Internet activity from campaign finance rules, created the loophole for moneybombs, according to Paul Ryan, a lawyer at the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center: "It's difficult to imagine any threat of corruption posed by an activist sitting at home trying to talk people into making small donations directly to a candidate's campaign.... These small donors are a good thing for the system.... This is the classic example of the modern soapbox."&lt;ref name=pol1/&gt;

[[Sonia Arrison]] of ''TechNewsWorld'' considered the transparency in pledge and donation amounts to be an important [[open-source]] element of moneybomb success: "Those revelations stand in direct contrast to traditional campaigns, which tend to be silent and proprietary about who is donating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/Considering-an-Open-Future-60322.html|title=Considering an Open Future|author=Arrison, Sonia|date=2007-11-16|accessdate=2007-12-12|work=TechNewsWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campaign finance analyst Leslie Wayne regarded the [[YouTube]] and viral campaigning associated with moneybombs as an unexpected new trend in campaign finance. Wayne found the November 5 event a remarkable success because "the Paul campaign never even asked donors for the money. A grassroots group of Paul supporters, via the Internet, all decided to have a one-day online fund-raiser for Dr. Paul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessjournalism.org/pages/biz/2007/12/uncovering_new_trends_in_campa/|title=Uncovering New Trends in Campaign Finance|date=2007-12-19|accessdate=2007-12-19|author=Wayne, Leslie|work=Business Journalism|publisher=[[Donald W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6084">'''Musicality''' (''music[[wikt:-al|-al]][[wikt:-ity|-ity]]'') is "sensitivity to, knowledge of, or talent for [[music]]" or "the quality or state of being musical", and is used to refer to specific if vaguely defined qualities in pieces and/or genres of music, such as [[melody|melodiousness]]&lt;!--example given by Merriam-Webster--&gt; and [[harmony|harmoniousness]].&lt;ref name="M-W"&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/musicality Musicality]", ''Merriam-Webster.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions are somewhat hampered by the difficulty of [[definition of music|defining music]], but, colloquially, "music" is often contrasted with [[noise]] and [[randomness]]. A person considered musical has the ability to perceive and reproduce differences in [[aspects of music]] including pitch, rhythm, and harmony (see: [[ear training]]). Two types of musicality may be differentiated: to be able to perceive music (musical receptivity)&lt;!--"sensitivity/knowledge"--&gt; and to be able to reproduce music in addition to creating music (musical creativity)&lt;!--knowledge/talent--&gt;.&lt;ref name="M-W"/&gt;

==Music vs. musicality==
Many studies on the cognitive and [[Evolutionary musicology|biological origins of music]] are centered on the question of what defines music. Can birdsong, the song structure of [[humpback whale]]s, a Thai elephant orchestra, or the interlocking duets of [[Gibbon]]s be considered music?&lt;ref&gt;Wallin, N.J., Merker, B., &amp; Brown, S. (2000). ''The Origins of Music'', {{page needed|date=August 2014}}. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|9780262731430}}.{{verification-inline|date=August 2014|reason=No mention of "elephant". Quote needed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is now generally seen as a pitfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01210.x| title = Cognition and the Evolution of Music: Pitfalls and Prospects| journal = Topics in Cognitive Science| volume = 4| issue = 4| pages = 513| year = 2012| last1 = Honing | first1 = H. | last2 = Ploeger | first2 = A. }}&lt;!--Honing, H., &amp; Ploeger, A. (2012). "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01210.x/abstract Cognition and the Evolution of Music: Pitfalls and Prospects]", ''Topics in Cognitive Science'' (TopiCS).--&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In trying to answer this question, it is important to separate between the notions of "music" and "musicality". Musicality – in all its complexity – can be defined as a natural, spontaneously developing trait based on and constrained by our biological and cognitive system, and music – in all its variety – as a social and cultural construct based on musicality. Or simply put: without musicality, there is no music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06402.x| pmid = 22524344| title = Without it no music: Beat induction as a fundamental musical trait| journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences| volume = 1252| pages = 85–91| year = 2012| last1 = Honing | first1 = H. }}&lt;!--Honing, H. (2012). Without it no music: beat induction as a fundamental musical trait. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1252: The Neurosciences and Music IV — Learning and Memory, 85–91. http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06402.x--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Honing, H. (ed.) (2018). The Origins of Musicality. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is still a challenge to demarcate precisely what makes up this complex trait we call musicality. What are the cognitive and biological mechanisms that are essential to perceive, make, and appreciate music? Only when we have identified these fundamental mechanisms are we in a position to see how these might have evolved. In other words: the study of the evolution of music cognition is dependent on a characterization of the basic mechanisms that make up musicality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2014.0088| title = Without it no music: Cognition, biology and evolution of musicality| journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| volume = 370| issue = 1664| pages = 20140088| year = 2015| last1 = Honing | first1 = H.| last2 = Ten Cate | first2 = C.| last3 = Peretz | first3 = I.| last4 = Trehub | first4 = S.

=== Notes ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
*''Resources of a Musician'': a notable musician draws from several essential ressources: ''Musicality'', ''Material'' (voice, dexterity), ''Practice'', ''Education''
*''Relation to Dancing:'' Musicality is also related to dancing, since musicality is essential for becoming a good dancer.
*''Relation to Structure:'' Certain types of music have a regular inner structure, which a musical person is able to pick up intuitively. A viable musical structure is supportive for musicality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2218">'''Polymorphous perversity''' is a [[psychoanalytic]] concept proposing the ability to gain [[sexual gratification]] outside [[social norm|socially normative]] sexual behaviors. [[Sigmund Freud]] used this term to describe the sexual disposition from infancy to about age five.

==Freud's theory==

Freud theorized that some are born with unfocused pleasure / [[libido|libidinal]] drives, deriving pleasure from any part of the body. The objects and modes of pleasurable satisfaction are multifarious, directed at every object that might provide pleasure. Polymorphous perverse sexuality continues from infancy through about age five, progressing through three distinct developmental stages: the [[oral stage]], [[anal stage]], and [[Genital stage|genital / phallic stage]]. Only in subsequent developmental stages do children learn to constrain drives towards pleasure-satisfaction to socially accepted norms, culminating in adult [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] behavior focused on the genitals and reproduction or sublimations of the procreative drive.

Freud taught that during this stage of undifferentiated impulse for pleasure, [[incest]]uous and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] urges are normal. Lacking knowledge that certain modes of gratification are forbidden, the polymorphously perverse child seeks gratification wherever it occurs. In the earliest phase, the oral phase, the child forms a libidinal bond with the mother via the inherent pleasure gained from [[breastfeeding|suckling at the breast]].

For Freud, "perversion" is a non-judgmental term. He used it to designate behavior outside the socially acceptable norms of his era.

[[Image:Old Farmer's Almanac 1793 cover.jpg|frame|''[[The Old Farmer's Almanac]]'' is famous in the US for its (not necessarily accurate) long-range weather predictions.]]

A '''prediction''' ([[Latin]] ''præ-'', "before," and ''dicere'', "to say"), or '''[[forecasting|forecast]]''', is a statement about a future [[event (probability theory)|event]]&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Wisdom and foresight in Chinese thought: sensing the immediate future. Journal of Futures Studies. 22(3), pp. 35-50. https://doi.org/10.6531/JFS.2018.22(3).00A35&lt;/ref&gt;. A prediction is often, but not always, based upon experience or knowledge. There is no universal agreement about the exact difference between the two terms; different authors and disciplines ascribe different [[connotation]]s. (Contrast with [[estimation]].)

Although future events are necessarily [[uncertainty|uncertain]], so guaranteed accurate information about the future is in many cases impossible, prediction can be useful to assist in making [[planning|plans]] about possible developments; Howard H. Stevenson writes that prediction in business "...  is at least two things: Important and hard."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Howard, ed. ''Do lunch or be lunch''. Boston: [[Harvard Business School Press]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgement-based prediction==
In a non-statistical sense, the term "prediction" is often used to refer to an [[hypothesis|informed guess or opinion]]&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, A., 2014. Modes of orientation provided by futures studies: making sense of diversity and divergence. European Journal of Futures Research, 2(1), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;.

A prediction of this kind might be informed by a predicting person's [[abductive reasoning]], [[inductive reasoning]], [[deductive reasoning]], and [[empirical evidence|experience]]; and may be of useful — if the predicting person is a [[expert|knowledgeable person]] in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Nate (2012) The signal and the noise: Why so many predictions fail--but some don't. The Penguin Press, New York, 534 p. {{ISBN|978-1-59420-411-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Delphi method]] is a technique for eliciting such expert-judgement-based predictions in a controlled way.  This type of prediction might be perceived as consistent with statistical techniques in the sense that, at minimum, the "data" being used is the predicting expert's [[Cognition|cognitive experiences]] forming an [[intuition|intuitive]] [[Probability density function|"probability curve."]]

==Statistics==
In [[statistics]], prediction is a part of [[statistical inference]]. One particular approach to such inference is known as [[predictive inference]], but the prediction can be undertaken within any of the several approaches to statistical inference. Indeed, one possible description of statistics is that it provides a means of transferring knowledge about a sample of a population to the whole population, and to other related populations, which is not necessarily the same as prediction over time. When information is transferred across time, often to specific points in time, the process is known as [[forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, D. R. (2006). Principles of Statistical Inference, Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-68567-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2017|reason=Reference does not mention "forecasting" at all.}} Forecasting usually requires [[time series]] methods, while prediction is often performed on [[cross-sectional data]].

Statistical techniques used for prediction include [[regression analysis]] and its various sub-categories such as [[linear regression]], [[generalized linear model]]s ([[logistic regression]], [[Poisson regression]], [[Probit regression]]), etc. In case of forecasting, [[autoregressive moving average model]]s and [[vector autoregression]] models can be utilized. When these and/or related, generalized set of regression or [[machine learning]] methods are deployed in commercial usage, the field is known as [[predictive analytics]].&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Eric (2013). Predictive analysis: The power to predict who will click, buy, lie, or die. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken, NJ, 302 p. {{ISBN|978-1-118-35685-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many applications, such as time series analysis, it is possible to estimate the models that generate the observations. If models can be expressed as transfer functions or in terms of state-space parameters then smoothed, filtered and predicted data estimates can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Einicke, G.A.

These techniques rely on one-step-ahead predictors (which minimise the variance of the prediction error). When the generating models are nonlinear then stepwise linearizations may be applied within [[Extended Kalman Filter]] and smoother recursions. However, in nonlinear cases, optimum minimum-variance performance guarantees no longer apply.&lt;ref&gt;Julier, S.J., Uhlmann, J.K. (2004). Unscented filtering and nonlinear estimation.

To use regression analysis for prediction, data are collected on the variable that is to be predicted, called the [[dependent variable]] or response variable, and on one or more variables whose values are [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] to influence it, called [[independent variable]]s or explanatory variables. A [[Function (mathematics)#Real-valued functions|functional form]], often linear, is hypothesized for the postulated causal relationship, and the [[parameter]]s of the function are [[estimation|estimated]] from the data—that is, are chosen so as to optimize is some way the [[goodness of fit|fit]] of the function, thus parameterized, to the data. That is the estimation step. For the prediction step, explanatory variable values that are deemed relevant to future (or current but not yet observed) values of the dependent variable are input to the parameterized function to generate predictions for the dependent variable.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, John (2016) Applied regression analysis and generalized linear models.

==Prediction in science==

In science, a prediction is a rigorous, often quantitative, statement, forecasting what would happen under specific conditions; for example, if an apple fell from a tree it would be attracted towards the center of the earth by [[gravity]] with a specified and constant [[acceleration]]. The [[scientific method]] is built on testing statements that are [[logical consequence]]s of scientific theories. This is done through repeatable [[experiment]]s or observational studies.

A [[scientific theory]] which is contradicted by observations and evidence will be rejected. New theories that generate many new predictions can more easily be supported or [[falsifiability|falsified]] (see [[predictive power]]). Notions that make no ''testable'' predictions are usually &lt;!--only usually; string theory is considered science though no predictions can be tested--&gt;considered not to be part of science ([[protoscience]] or nescience) until testable predictions can be made.

[[Mathematical equation]]s and [[Mathematical model|models]], and [[computer model]]s, are frequently used to describe the past and future behaviour of a process within the boundaries of that model. In some cases the [[probability]] of an outcome, rather than a specific outcome, can be predicted, for example in much of [[quantum physics]].

In [[microprocessor]]s, [[Branch predictor|branch prediction]] permits avoidance of [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] emptying at [[Branch (computer science)|branch instructions]]. In [[engineering]], possible failure modes are predicted and avoided by correcting the mechanism causing the failure.

Accurate prediction and forecasting are very difficult in some areas, such as [[natural disasters]], [[pandemics]], [[demography]], [[population dynamics]] and [[meteorology]]. For example, it is possible to predict the occurrence of [[solar cycle]]s, but their exact timing and magnitude is much more difficult (see picture to right).

===Scientific hypothesis and prediction===
Established science makes useful predictions which are often extremely reliable and accurate; for example, [[eclipse]]s are routinely predicted.

New theories make predictions which allow them to be disproved by reality. For example, predicting the structure of crystals at the atomic level is a current research challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Woodley, S.M. |author2=Catlow, R. |year=2008 |title=Crystal structure prediction from first principles |journal=Nat Mater |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=937–946 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat2321}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the scientific consensus was that there existed an absolute [[frame of reference]], which was given the name ''[[luminiferous ether]]''. The existence of this absolute frame was deemed necessary for consistency with the established idea that the speed of light is constant. The famous [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] demonstrated that predictions deduced from this concept were not borne out in reality, thus disproving the theory of an absolute frame of reference. The [[special theory of relativity]] was proposed by Einstein as an explanation for the seeming inconsistency between the constancy of the speed of light and the non-existence of a special, preferred or absolute frame of reference.

[[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] could not easily be tested as it did not produce any effects observable on a terrestrial scale. However, the theory predicted that large masses such as [[star]]s would bend light, in contradiction to accepted theory; this was observed in a 1919 eclipse.

==Finance==
[[File:Prediction market - example GUI - 2.gif|thumb|right|220px|[[Prediction market]]]]
Mathematical models of [[stock market]] behaviour (and economic behaviour in general) are also unreliable in predicting future behaviour. Among other reasons, this is because economic events may span several years, and the world is changing over a similar time frame, thus invalidating the relevance of past observations to the present. Thus there are an extremely small number (of the order of 1) of relevant past data points from which to project the future. In addition, it is generally believed that stock market prices already take into account all the information available to predict the future, and subsequent movements must therefore be the result of unforeseen events. Consequently, it is extremely difficult for a [[stock investor]] to [[Foresight (psychology)|anticipate]] or predict a [[stock market boom]], or a [[stock market crash]]. In contrast to predicting the actual stock return, forecasting of broad economic trends tends to have better accuracy. Such analysis is provided by both non-profit groups as well as by for-profit private institutions, including brokerage housesand consulting companies.

Some correlation has been seen between actual stock market movements and prediction data from large groups in surveys and prediction games.

An [[actuary]] uses [[actuarial science]] to assess and predict future business [[risk]], such that the risk(s) can be [[Emergency management|mitigated]]. For example, in [[insurance]] an actuary would use a [[Actuarial table|life table]] (which incorporates the historical experience of mortality rates and sometimes an estimate of future trends) to project [[life expectancy]].

==Sports==

Predicting the outcome of sporting events is a business which has grown in popularity in recent years.  Handicappers predict the outcome of games using a variety of mathematical formulas, simulation models or [[Qualitative research|qualitative analysis]].  Early, well known sports bettors, such as [[Jimmy the Greek]], were believed to have access to information that gave them an edge.  Information ranged from personal issues, such as gambling or drinking to undisclosed injuries; anything that may affect the performance of a player on the field.

Recent times have changed the way sports are predicted.  Predictions now typically consist of two distinct approaches: Situational plays and statistical based models.  Situational plays are much more difficult to measure because they usually involve the motivation of a team.  Dan Gordon, noted handicapper, wrote “Without an emotional edge in a game in addition to value in a line, I won’t put my money on it”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Gordon, Dan

 | isbn = 978-1-5804-2174-4
 | url = http://cardozabooks.com/BEAT-THE-SPORTS-BOOKS.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These types of plays consist of: Betting on the home underdog, betting against Monday Night winners if they are a favorite next week, betting the underdog in “look ahead” games etc.  As situational plays become more widely known they become less useful because they will impact the way the line is set.

The widespread use of technology has brought with it more modern [[sports betting systems]].  These systems are typically algorithms and simulation models based on [[regression analysis]]. [[Jeff Sagarin]], a sports statistician, has brought attention to sports by having the results of his models published in USA Today.  He is currently paid as a consultant by the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for his advice on lineups and the use of his Winval system, which evaluates free agents. [[Advanced NFL Stats|Brian Burke]], a former [[Navy]] fighter pilot turned sports statistician, has published his results of using regression analysis to predict the outcome of NFL games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Burke, Brian
 | date = 2008

 | url = http://www.advancednflstats.com/2007/09/nfl-win-prediction-methodology.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Pomeroy]] is widely accepted as a leading authority on college basketball statistics.  His website includes his College Basketball Ratings, a tempo based statistics system.  Some statisticians have become very famous for having successful prediction systems.  Dare wrote “the effective odds for sports betting and horse racing are a direct result of human decisions and can therefore potentially exhibit consistent error”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Dare, William H

==Opinion polls==
[[File:2004 canadian election approval ratings June 2.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Approval rating]]s (percentages) for the 2004 Canadian federal election]]

In [[politics]] it is common to attempt to predict the outcome of [[elections]] via [[political forecasting]] techniques (or assess the popularity of [[politicians]]) through the use of [[opinion polls]]. [[Prediction games]] have been used by many corporations and governments to learn about the most likely outcome of future events.

==Supernatural prediction==
{{Main|Prophecy}}

Predictions have often been made, from antiquity until the present, by using [[paranormal]] or [[supernatural]] means such as [[prophecy]] or by observing [[omen]]s. Methods including [[water divining]], [[astrology]], [[numerology]], [[fortune telling]], [[Oneiromancy|interpretation of dreams]], and many other forms of [[divination]], have been used for millennia to attempt to predict the future. These means of prediction have not been proven by scientific experiments.

In literature, vision and prophecy are literary devices used to present a possible timeline of future events.  They can be distinguished by vision referring to what an individual sees happen. The [[New Testament]] book of [[Revelation|Revelation (Bible)]] thus uses vision as a literary device in this regard. It is also prophecy or prophetic literature when it is related by an individual in a [[sermon]] or other public forum.

[[Divination]] is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic standardized process or ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Peek, P.M. ''African Divination Systems: Ways of Knowing.'' page 2. Indiana University Press. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an integral part of witchcraft and has been used in various forms for thousands of years. Diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a [[querent]] should proceed by reading signs, events, or [[omen]]s, or through alleged contact with a [[supernatural]] agency, most often describe as an angel or a god though viewed by Christians and Jews as a fallen angel or demon.&lt;ref name="merriamw"&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/divination ''Definition of divination'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prediction in fiction==
Fiction (especially fantasy, [[future history|forecasting]] and science fiction) often features instances of prediction achieved by unconventional means.
* In fantasy literature, predictions are often obtained through [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[prophecy]], sometimes referring back to old traditions. For example, in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', many of the characters possess an awareness of events extending into the future, sometimes as prophecies, sometimes as more-or-less vague 'feelings'. The character [[Galadriel]], in addition, employs a water "mirror" to show images, sometimes of possible future events.
* In some of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s stories, mutant humans called ''precogs'' can foresee the future (ranging from days to years). In the story called ''The Golden Man'', an exceptional mutant can predict the future to an indefinite range (presumably up to his death), and thus becomes completely non-human, an animal that follows the predicted paths automatically. Precogs also play an essential role in another of Dick's stories, ''[[The Minority Report]]'', which was turned into a [[Minority Report (film)|film]] by [[Steven Spielberg]] in 2002.
* In the ''[[Foundation series|Foundation]]'' series by [[Isaac Asimov]], a mathematician finds out that historical events (up to some detail) can be theoretically modelled using equations, and then spends years trying to put the theory in practice. The new science of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]] founded upon his success can simulate history and extrapolate the present into the future.
* In [[Frank Herbert]]'s sequels to 1965's ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', his characters are dealing with the repercussions of being able to see the possible futures and select amongst them. Herbert sees this as a trap of stagnation, and his characters follow a so-called "[[Golden Path (Dune)|Golden Path]]" out of the trap.
* In [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', the humanoid inhabitants of planet Gethen have mastered the art of prophecy and routinely produce data on past, present or future events on request. In this story, this was a minor plot device.

'''Reciprocal pronouns''' are a type of [[pronoun]] which can be used to refer to a [[noun phrase]] mentioned earlier in a sentence. The reciprocal pronouns found in English are ''one another'' and ''each other'', and they form the category of [[anaphor]]s along with [[reflexive pronoun]]s (''myself'', ''yourselves'', etc.).

==Theoretical and background information==

Within the theory of [[generative grammar]], and within phrase-structure grammar, [[Binding (linguistics)|binding theory]] explains how anaphors share a relationship with their referents.

Binding Principle A of this theory states:
#X binds Y if and only if X [[c-command]]s Y, and X and Y are coindexed, 
#Anaphors must be locally bound within the binding domain of the clause containing the DP [[determiner phrase]].

In binding theory, the category of anaphor includes both reflexives and reciprocals, which is a problem, since they are distributed differently.

The differences in the distribution of reflexives and reciprocals are illustrated below using [[X-bar theory]] tree diagrams.

==Reflexive versus reciprocal==

Reflexive pronouns are used similarly to reciprocal pronouns in the sense that they typically refer back to the subject of the sentence.

(1) ''John and Mary like '''themselves'''.''
(2) ''John and Mary like '''each other'''.''

The main difference between reflexives, as in example (1), and reciprocal pronouns, as in example (2), is that reflexives are used when the subject acts upon itself. Reciprocals are used when members of a group perform the same action relative to one another. Reciprocal pronouns exist in many languages. They are associated with plural noun phrases and indicate a reciprocal relationship between the members of the plural noun phrase. This means that some member (x) of the plural subject is acting on another member (y) of the subject, and that member (y) is also acting on (x), and that both x and y are members of the group denoted by the antecedent subject.

Below are examples of reciprocal pronouns and how their relationship to their antecedents contrasts to cases of reflexive pronoun relationships, and regular transitive relationships, and how they behave in relation to direct object pronouns in the same situation.  Let R denote a Relation, and let the variables (for example, (x, y) ) stand for the arguments introduced by R.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Logical form !! Example !! Pronominal form !! Referential dependency !! Scenario (set of girls, Anne and Betty)
|-
| R(x, y) || ''The girls saw '''her'''.'' || (regular) pronoun || x≠y (x and y are distinct) || A saw someone female, B saw someone female.
|-
| R(x, x) || ''The girls saw '''themselves''' (in the mirror).'' || reflexive pronoun || x=y (x and y are not distinct) || A saw A in the mirror and B saw B in the mirror.

|-
| R(x, y) AND (y, x) || ''The girls saw '''each other''' in the mirror.'' || reciprocal pronoun || R(x,y) AND R(y,x) || A saw B in the mirror and B saw A in the mirror.
|}

Therefore, we can look at a reciprocal relationship using this notation, using the verb ''see'' as the relation: 
see(Anne, Betty) and see(Betty, Anne).

==Distribution==

Although both reciprocal and reflexive pronouns are both classified as anaphors, there are some distributional differences between them.  For example, reciprocal pronouns can appear in the subject position of noun phrases, whereas reflexives cannot.

 (3) a. ''John and Mary like '''each other's''' parents.'' 
     b. *''John likes '''himself's''' parents.''
 (4) a. ''All of the students would know if '''each other''' had the answers.''
     b. *''The student would know if '''himself''' had the answer.''

In example (4b) with the reflexive anaphor, the embedded clause's [[complementizer]] phrase (CP) beginning with the word "if", cannot introduce a subject noun phrase.

Although in many cases, either a reflexive or a reciprocal pronoun could appear in the same structural position, in some cases, the asymmetry occurs when a reciprocal may be bound to its antecedent, but a reflexive may not.

The following examples from Lebeaux (1983) show that in some sentences, either type of anaphor could be used:

 (5) a. ''John and Mary like '''themselves'''.''
     b. ''John and Mary like '''each other'''.''

Both the reflexive pronoun in (5a) and the reciprocal pronoun in (5b) can be locally bound (its [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] is in the same clause, the clause is the [[binding domain]]), which would follow binding theory's binding principle A: that an anaphor must be bound in its binding domain).  
A case in which we can see the differences in the distribution of reflexive and reciprocal pronouns is in the subject position of embedded clauses: reflexives cannot occur in this position (6a), but reciprocals can (6b).
 
 (6) a. *''John thinks that '''himself''' will win.''
     b.  ''John and Mary think that '''each other''' will win.''

[[File:Syntax tree with reciprocal pronoun.png|thumb|Syntax tree with reciprocal pronoun]]

As we can see in the X-bar theory tree diagram of (6b), the reciprocal pronoun is in the subject position of the embedded clause, which is introduced by complementizer "that".  It is not possible for a reflexive pronoun to occur in this position as shown by the ungrammaticality of (6a).

In this case, the reciprocal pronoun is not necessarily the ideal construction, but the reflexive is not a possible grammatical sentence. This suggests that while reflexives require a proper binder, reciprocals may appear in positions that are not governed this way, and can even be in a different clause than the antecedent.

The differences can be summarized as follows:
 
*Reciprocals are subject to binding theory;
*Reflexives are subject to binding theory, ''and'' must be properly governed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lebeaux|first=D|title=A Distributional Difference between Reciprocals and Reflexives|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|year=1983|jstor=4178359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology of reciprocals==

===Different language examples===

====English====

Examining the semantic relations of reciprocity, we see further differences within reciprocal relationships, such as those between each-the-other and each other relations. In general, if it is possible to divide a set into subsets such that within each subset an each-the-other relationship holds, then the whole set of events can be described by an each other sentence.
''Each other'' constructions characterize an entire set of individuals (as indicated by the plural antecedent), but allow for some vagueness in their interpretation. In contrast, ''each...the other'' constructions characterize each member of a set.  Therefore, we can see that ''each other'' doesn't force a strict distributional interpretation. If we separate ''each'' and ''other'', we can get different interpretations.

:(7) a. ''The men are hugging '''each other'''.''
::   b. '''''Each''' of the men is hugging the '''others'''.''

In (7a) every member of the set ''the men'' must be in some reciprocal relationship of hugging at some unspecified point during the time frame of the hugging event. In (7b), we infer that each of the men hugged every other man in the group of men who participated in the hugging event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fiengo|author2=Lasnik|last-author-amp=yes|title=The Logical Structure of Reciprocal Sentences in English.|journal=Foundations of Language|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In examining the scope of reciprocal pronouns, we can see that in English, the antecedent must be plural and must receive at least a (weakly) distributed interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|title=Reciprocal Scope.|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|year=1991|volume=22|issue=1|pages=159–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In viewing "each other" as one pronoun, "each" is not assigned scope as a [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]], thus allowing for a weaker distribution.  The distributivity of the above example #2 is not enforced down to the level of all individuals, as opposed to #1, in which "each" as a separate entity and a quantifier enforces strict distributivity.

Reciprocal pronouns and reciprocal constructions is not restricted to English.  Below are some examples from other languages.

====Chichewa====

In English, the reciprocal ''each other'' is a noun phrase that takes an argument position of a syntactic [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], whereas in Chichewa, the reciprocal is an intransitive verbal affix ''-an''. However, the meaning of the reciprocal is the same in both languages. The reciprocals ''each other'' and ''-an'' both require a group antecedent. The English example in (7a) is interpreted relative to members of the group denoted by the reciprocal antecedent ''the boys''.  The same holds of the Chichewa example in (7b): the Chichewa reciprocal likewise requires a group antecedent.

:(8) a. ''The boys are hitting '''each other'''.''
::b. ''Mbidzi zi-ku-meny-'''an'''-a.''
:::    zebras SM-Tns/Asp-hit-'''RECIP'''-FV
:::     'The zebras are hitting '''each other'''.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalrymple, McHombo, Peters|first=M., S.A., S.|title=Semantic similarities and syntactic contrasts between Chichewa and English reciprocals|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|year=1994|volume=25|issue=1|pages=145–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dutch====

The reciprocal pronouns in Dutch are ''elkaar'' and ''mekaar''. While ''elkaar'' is a single [[morpheme]] that is equivalent to the English reciprocal pronoun ''each other'', ''mekaar'' is equivalent to the English reciprocal pronoun ''one another''. The difference between the two Dutch reciprocal pronouns is in terms of their use and frequency of use. ''Mekaar'' is used less often, mainly in colloquial speech and in children's speech. Similar to English, Dutch ''elkaar'' requires the antecedent to be in the same clause:

:(9) ''Jan en Marijke slaan '''elkaar.'''''
::   Jan and Marijke hit   '''RECIP'''
::  'Jan and Marijke hit '''each other'''.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philip|first=W|title=Adult and Child Understanding of Simple Reciprocal Sentences|journal=Language|year=2000|doi=10.2307/417391 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koster&amp;Reuland|first=J&amp;J|title=Long Distance Anaphora|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Different forms of reciprocal pronouns===

====Free reciprocal pronouns====

'''''Person-marked free pronouns'''''

These have a similar pattern to personal pronouns, as they are morphemes independent from the verb (and not [[clitic]]s, or inflection markers). They possess person [[Feature (linguistics)|features]] : the reciprocal pronoun surfaces differently when its antecedent is first-, second- or third-person. These are common in the [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] language [[Hausa language|Hausa]]:

:(10) ''mun tsall`ak¯e '''j¯unan'''-m `u''
::   1pl.aux jumped '''RECIP'''-1pl
:::  'We jumped over '''one another'''. '
:::  (Evans 2008: 58 (26))
'''''Person-unmarked free pronouns'''''

Person-unmarked free pronouns occur in languages that do not have distinct forms for all persons. This is commonly found in German.  Unlike person-marked pronouns, person-unmarked free pronouns cannot occur in contexts where the pronoun is modifying the noun (i.e. each other's parents), and in contexts where there is a non-subject antecedent (i.e. introduced them to one another).

:(11) ''Die beiden Angeklagten beschuldigten '''sich'''  gegenseitig ('''einander''') und ihre Nachbarn.''
::   the both defendants accused       '''RECIP''' mutually and their neighbours.
:: 'The two defendants accused '''each other''' as well as their neighbours.'
::    (Evans 2008: 59 (28))

====Bound reciprocal pronouns====

'''''Bound pronominal reciprocal affixes'''''

Reciprocal pronouns can be affixed to either the verb, or to the auxiliary base, as in Warlpiri:

:(12) ''Ngarrka-jarra-rlu ka-pala-'''nyanu''' paka-rni.''
::     man-du-erg ipfv-3du.sbj-'''ref''' strike-npst
::     'The (two) men are striking '''each other.''' '
::      (Evans 2008: 60 (30))

'''''Reciprocal pronominal clitics'''''

Reciprocal pronominal clitics are commonly found in the Romance languages.  These are seen in French and Spanish as ''se'' and Italian ''si''. In finite clauses, they are preverbal in French, Italian, and Spanish. In nonfinite clauses and infinitive constructions, the clitic follows the verb in Spanish and Italian, but not in French.

In the Australian language Wanyi, reciprocal pronominal clitics differentiate between person and number, and can attach to other elements, not restricted to attaching to just the verb.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
S L Bhyrappa was born at Santeshivara, a village in the [[Channarayapatna]] taluk of [[Hassan district]], about 162&amp;nbsp;km from [[Bangalore]]. He lost his mother and brothers to [[Bubonic plague]] early in childhood and took on odd jobs to pay for his education. During his childhood he was influenced by the writer [[Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar]].

Bhyrappa completed his primary education in [[Channarayanapatana|Channarayapatna taluk]] before moving to [[Mysore]] where he completed the rest of his education. His autobiography, ''Bhitti'' (Wall) records a break in his high school education. Bhyrappa impulsively quit school, following his cousin's advice and wandered for a year with him. His sojourn led him to [[Mumbai]], where he worked as a [[Rail transport|railway porter]]. In [[Mumbai]] he met a group of [[sadhu]]s and joined them to seek spiritual solace. He wandered with them for a few months before returning to [[Mysore]] to resume his education.

=== Career ===

S L Bhyrappa was a Lecturer of Philosophy at Sri Kadasiddheshwar College, [[Hubli]]; [[Sardar Patel University]] in [[Gujarat]]; [[National Council of Educational Research and Training|NCERT]], [[Delhi]]; and the Regional College of Education, [[Mysore]] from which he retired in 1991. Bhyrappa has two sons, and lives with his wife in Mysore.

Bhyrappa is widely read in English, Kannada and Sanskrit, and educated in Indian and western philosophy. He can quote{{weasel|date=April 2018}} authors ranging from William James to [[V.S. Naipaul]].

== Works ==
Starting with ''Bheemakaya'', first published in 1958, Bhyrappa has authored twenty four novels in a career spanning more than five decades. ''Vamshavruksha'', ''Tabbaliyu Neenade Magane'', ''Matadana'' and ''Nayi Neralu'' were made into films that received critical acclaim.  ''Vamshavruksha'' has received the [[Kannada Sahitya Parishat|Kannada Sahitya Academy]] Award in 1966 and ''Daatu'' (Crossing Over) received both the [[Kannada Sahitya Parishat|Kannada]] and the [[Sahitya Akademi|Kendra Sahitya Academy]] awards in 1975.&lt;ref name="academy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahitya-akademi.org/sahitya-akademi/awa10307.htm#kannada|title=Sahitya Akademi Awards 1955–2005|work=Online Webpage of Sahitya Academy|publisher=Sahitya Academy of India|accessdate=23 June 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211010650/http://www.sahitya-akademi.org/sahitya-akademi/awa10307.htm#kannada|archivedate=11 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Parva'', the most critically acclaimed of all his novels narrates the social structure, values and mortality in the epic of [[Mahabharata]] very effectively. Bhyrappa reconstructs the Mahabharatha from sociological and anthropological angle, through metaphors in this novel.&lt;ref name="parva"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/02/10/stories/2007021002030200.htm|title= Bhyrappa to receive Deraje Award|work=Online Webpage of The Hindu|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=10 July 2007|location=Chennai, India|date=10 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity==
Many of Bhyrappa's novels have been translated into other Indian languages and English.&lt;ref name="translate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaclub.com/shop/AuthorSelect.asp?Author=S+L+Bhyrappa|title=S L Bhyrappa|work=Online Webpage of India book club|publisher=The India Club|accessdate=23 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhyrappa has been one of the best selling authors in Kannada for past twenty five years, and translations of his books have been best sellers for the past eight years in the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and in the past five years in [[Hindi language|Hindi]].&lt;ref name="top"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysoredasara.com/html/personalities.htm|title=Personalities of Mysore|work=Online Webpage of Dasara Committee|publisher=Mysore city corporation|accessdate=22 June 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826131814/http://www.mysoredasara.com/html/personalities.htm|archivedate=26 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of his novels have been reprinted several times. His recently printed novel [[Aavarana]] was sold out even before its release. The novel went on to create a record in Indian literary circles with ten reprints within five months of its release.&lt;ref name="reprint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Jun112007/state200706116783.asp|title=Bhyrappas work speaks volumes; goes for 10th edition|work=Online Webpage of Deccan Herald|publisher=Deccan Herald|accessdate=23 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070613124830/http://deccanherald.com/Content/Jun112007/state200706116783.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His latest novel ''[[Yaana (novel)|Yaana]]'' ("journey"), was released on August 2014. All his novels are published by Saahitya Bhandaara in [[Hubli]], Karnataka.

== Controversies ==
Bhyrappa was the center of controversies because of his themes and positions on sensitive issues.&lt;ref name="debate"/&gt; Some of Bhyrappa's prominent novels (such as ''Vamshavruksha, Tabbaliyu Neenaade Magane, Parva,'' and ''Saartha'') have strong roots in ancient Indian philosophical tradition, thus inviting severe criticism from the [[Kannada literature#Modern Kannada (hosagannaDa)|Navya]] writers and from others. Bhyrappa supported [[N. R. Narayana Murthy]] when the latter was criticized by the media and the public regarding the controversy over playing an instrumental version of the national anthem at an important occasion. He also backed N. R. Narayana Murthy regarding [[Kaveri River Water Dispute|Kaveri issue]] saying riots and protests are not going to solve the issue.&lt;ref name="nrn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/Archives/apr122007/state216162007412.asp|title= I stand by NRN: Bhyrappa|work=Online Webpage of Deccan Herald|publisher=Deccan Herald|accessdate=22 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122230/http://www.deccanherald.com/Archives/apr122007/state216162007412.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhyrappa had a debate with [[Girish Karnad]] in the publication [[Vijaya Karnataka]] regarding the religious tolerance of 18th century Mysore ruler [[Tippu Sultan]]. In Bhyrappa's novel [[Aavarana]], he accuses Tippu Sultan of being a religious fanatic who could not stand Hindus in his court. Bhyrappa had substantiated the argument based on several historic sources written in India during Tippu Sultan's rule. One of the issues Bhyrappa raised was the usage of Persian word ''bin'' (which is used to refer to a person as a "son of") in Government of Karnataka records even during modern times. This practice started during Tippu Sultan's rule, which according to Bhyrappa was one of the several methods used to enforce Islamic rule on Hindus. The book discusses other methods used by Tippu Sultan to convert Hindus to Islam. Bhyrappa backs his claims with historical references. This was criticized by Girish Karnad, who portrays Tippu Sultan as a secular ruler in his plays. Bhyrappa accused Karnad of giving an inaccurate account of Tippu Sultan in his plays.

[[U.R. Ananthamurthy]] was a prominent critic of Bhyrappa's novels. Bhyrappa has documented his debate with Ananthamurthy in ''Bhitti'', as well as in a few essays in his book ''Naaneke Bareyuttene''. Bhyrappa's more recent novel ''Avarana'' brings out historical information about what Islamic rule did to ancient Indian social and cultural life. This has stirred a major controversy. There have been accusations leveled at Bhyrappa of being a Hindu fundamentalist who wants to divide society on the basis of history, an allegation which Bhyrappa anticipates and tries to refute by referring to notable sources.&lt;ref name="avarana"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/06/08/stories/2007060852190300.htm|title=  Masks of untruth|work=Online Webpage of The Hindu|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=22 June 2007|location=Chennai, India|date=8 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ananthamurthy criticized Bhyrappa and his works, calling ''[[Aavarana]]'' "dangerous". Ananthamurthy accused Bhyrappa of being more of a debater than a story teller (Quote:"doesn't know what Hindu religion stands for" and "does not know how to write novels").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/May282007/state200705274057.asp Bhyrappa a debater, not a story-teller, says URA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203203451/http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/May282007/state200705274057.asp |date=3 December 2007 }} Deccan Herald – 28 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However Bhyrappa claims that the novel was result of his search for truth and there was no ulterior motive behind the novel. He urges critics to study the reference books mentioned in the novel before arriving at any conclusion about it.&lt;ref name="critic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/06/05/stories/2007060507210300.htm|title=   Bhyrappa hits out at critics|work=Online Webpage of The Hindu|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=22 June 2007|location=Chennai, India|date=5 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stochastic screening''' or '''FM screening''' is a [[halftone]] process based on [[Pseudorandomness|pseudo-random]] distribution of halftone dots, using [[frequency modulation]] (FM) to change the density of dots according to the gray level desired.  Traditional [[amplitude modulation]] halftone screening is based on a geometric and fixed spacing of dots, which vary in size depending on the tone color represented (for example, from 10 to 200 [[micrometre]]s).  The stochastic screening or FM screening instead uses a fixed size of dots (for example, about 25 micrometres) and a distribution density that varies depending on the color’s tone.

The technique of stochastic screening, which has existed since the seventies,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} has had a revival in recent times thanks to increased use of [[Computer to plate|computer-to-plate]] (CTP) techniques. In previous techniques, [[computer to film]], during the exposure there could be a drastic variation in the quality of the plate. It was a very delicate and difficult procedure that was not much used. Today, with CTP during the creation of the plate you just need to check a few parameters on the density and tonal correction curve. When you make a plate with stochastic screening you must use a tone correction curve, this curve allows one to align the tone reproduction of an FM screen to that of an industry standard.
Given the same final presswork tone value, an FM screen utilizes more halftone dots than an AM/XM screen. The result is that more light is filtered by the ink and less light simply reflects off the surface of the substrate. The result is that FM screens exhibit a greater color gamut than conventional AM/XM halftone screen frequencies.
The creation of a plate with stochastic screening is done the same way as is done with an AM/XM screen. A tone reproduction compensation curve is typically applied to align the stochastic screening to conventional AM/FM tone reproductions targets (e.g. ISO 12647-2).

==Advantages==
* The screening of four colors is no longer made with four different angles as with the traditional screen therefore it eliminates screening moiré.
* FM screening does not create rosette patterns.
* Halftone dot sizes can be as fine as 10 micrometres, which gives the product a quality comparable to that of photographic prints.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
* The effects of misregistration are not completely eliminated, but the effect is certainly less apparent than in the traditional screening, this feature is very favorable for printing on rotary machines where the misregistration is very common due to effects such as web growth.
* The use of FM screening allowed [[Archant]], a UK regional publisher, to switch to fonts with "tiny holes"; such an "eco-font" permitted a reduction in ink without turning fine text grainy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2011/news/new-eco-font-developed-by-newspaper-publisher/ | title= New ‘eco-font’ developed by publisher | author=Helen Lambourne | date= May 6, 2011 | publisher= HoldtheFrontPage.co.uk| location= Derby |accessdate=2011-05-10| quote=We have always printed black solid text using 100pc black ink but ...we intend to reduce all text to a 90pc screen. This does not affect quality in any way but it does save on ink. Archant is the only newspaper company in this country capable of undertaking this because of its FM screen technology. Traditional newspaper AM screen technology would have resulted in fine text becoming grainy....Photographs will be unaffected and it will also have the added benefit of less black ink rub off.  The process involves punching tiny holes, which are invisible without a magnifying glass, into the font.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
The small dots used in FM screening require special care and cleanliness, especially when plates are made from films.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32158">[[Image:Salem Church Relocation.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Hydraulically powered dollies move a historic 19th-century brick church in [[Salem, Massachusetts]].]]

A '''structure relocation''' is the process of moving a [[structure]] from one location to another. There are two main ways for a structure to be moved: disassembling and then reassembling it at the required destination, or transporting it whole. For the latter, the building is first [[House raising|raised]] and then may be pushed on temporary rails or dollies if the distance is short. Otherwise, wheels, such as [[flatbed truck]]s, are used. These moves can be complicated and require the removal of protruding parts of the building, such as the [[chimney]], as well as obstacles along the journey, such as [[overhead cable]]s and trees.

Reasons for moving a building range from commercial reasons such as scenery, to preserving an important or historic building. Moves may also be made simply at the whim of the owner, or to separate a building from the plot of land on which it stands.

==Equipment==
Elevating a whole structure is typically done by attaching a temporary steel framework under the structure to support the structure. A network of hydraulic jacks is placed under the framework and controlled by a unified jacking system, elevates the structure off the foundation. An older, low-technology method is to use building jacks called screw jacks or jackscrews which are manually turned.

With both types of jacking systems described here wood beams called cribs, cribbing or box cribs are stacked into piles to support both the structure and the jacks as the structure is lifted in increments. Once the structure is at a sufficient height, a flat bed truck or hydraulic dollies are placed under the steel framework to support moves to the final destination. After the move the structure is lowered reversing the steps just applied.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Reasons for moving a structure==
There are several reasons why a structure may be moved. For example, a redevelopment, such as [[urban renewal|urban regeneration]], could cause a relocation. Additionally, it has been purchased and the buyer wishes to move it, for reasons such as the scenery from the building. The owner might also sell the land that the building is on, but keep the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mammothmovers.com/why_relocate|title=Why Relocate?|accessdate=2008-03-24|publisher=Mammoth Movers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason for the relocation of a building is to preserve it for historic interest. An example of such preservation is the [[Lin An Tai Historical House and Museum|Lin An Tai Historical House]] in [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]. Such a move could be made because a building is in danger at its present location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesis.lib.cycu.edu.tw/ETD-db/ETD-search/view_etd?URN=etd-0919106-184612|title=ETD Database|accessdate=2008-03-24|date=2003-10-21|publisher=Digital Library and Archives |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416154940/http://thesis.lib.cycu.edu.tw/ETD-db/ETD-search/view_etd?URN=etd-0919106-184612 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the island of [[Chiloe]], in [[Chile]], there is a tradition of moving houses if the original site is haunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qi.com/infocloud/haunted-houses |title=Haunted Houses |publisher=Quite Interesting Limited |at="Moving House" section |accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house is placed on tree trunk rollers and dragged to the new location by oxen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/8475642.stm |title=In pictures: House moving in Chile |date=2010-02-01 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable moves==

===Whole moves===
[[London]]'s [[Marble Arch]] (1847) was originally the entrance to the newly-rebuilt [[Buckingham Palace]]. Following the expansion of Buckingham Palace, it was moved to a location near [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], with work being completed in 1851.&lt;ref name=past&gt;{{PastScape|mnumber=1492760|mname= Marble Arch |accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]]. 28 February 2005. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4303919.stm Marooned Marble Arch may be moved]". Accessed 27 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to save a single tree, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], the first President of the [[Republic of Turkey]], moved his summer house, the [[Yalova Atatürk Mansion]], four meters to the east in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yuruyenkosk.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the Compania Telefónica de Mexico (Telephone Company of Mexico) building located in the city of Guadalajara was moved 11.8 meters without any interruption of telephone operations. Building weights 1,700 metric tons. Project started on May and ended on November, 1950. The building movement itself took 5 days. Head of the project was Jorge Matute Remus,&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Jorge Matute Remus]]&lt;/ref&gt; construction engineer and headmaster of the Universidad De Guadalajara at the time.

The Cudecom Building in Bogotá, Colombia (Weight 7,000 Metric Tons, Distance Moved: 95 Feet); was moved in October 1974 using Steel Rollers. The 8 story building was moved westward to build an avenue. The move of the Cudecom Building was in the Guinness Book of World Records for 30 years. This structure was the heaviest building ever moved successfully until the Fu Gang Building in China was moved in 2004.

The [[Gem Theatre (Detroit)|Gem Theatre]] and [[Century Theatre (Detroit)|Century Theatre]], both housed within the same building in [[Detroit]], were moved five blocks on wheels to its new location at 333 Madison Avenue on 16 October 1997, because of the development of the [[Comerica Park]] area when it became home of the [[Detroit Tigers]]. At a distance of {{convert|563|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} it is the furthest known relocation of a sizable building setting a world record by [http://experthousemovers-texas.com Expert House Movers, LLC].&lt;ref&gt;[[Guinness World Records]]. "[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=50127 Farthest Building Relocation]". Accessed 27 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Structure relocation was common in the 1980s in [[Romania]] because of [[Nicolae Ceausescu|Ceausescu's]] building projects. Many buildings, including churches and older apartment blocks used to be relocated using hydraulics. One of the most notable feats achieved was on 27 May 1987, when a whole apartment block weighing 7600 Tonnes was split in half and completely relocated, with people left inside, with no damage whatsoever. As of this day the building still stands, and it was one of the most challenging relocations in the whole world.

As part of the [[Minnesota Shubert Performing Arts and Education Center]] development the Shubert Theatre was moved between 9 February 1999 and 21 February 1999. The 2,638 [[tonne]] (2,596 [[short ton]]) building was moved three [[city block]]s and is the heaviest recorded building move done on wheels.&lt;ref&gt;Guinness World Records. "[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=53297 Heaviest Building Moved On Wheels]". Accessed 27 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 850 tonne [[Belle Tout lighthouse]] was built in 1831 near the edge of the cliff on the next headland west from [[Beachy Head]], [[East Sussex]], [[England]]. It was moved more than {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=off}} further inland in 1999 due to cliff [[erosion]]. It was pushed by four [[hydraulics|hydraulic jacks]] along four steel and concrete beams to a new site that was designed specifically to allow for possible future relocations.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News. 19 March 1999. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/specials/set99/298123.stm Lighthouse megamove complete]". Accessed 27 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the {{convert|208|ft|m|adj=on}} tall, 2540-tonne [[Cape Hatteras Lighthouse]] was moved {{convert|2900|ft|m}} to protect it from being undermined by [[beach erosion]]. When the [[North Carolina]] [[lighthouse]] was built in 1870, it was over {{convert|1500|ft|m}} from the [[Atlantic Ocean|sea]], but by 1935 the beach had eroded and the waves were only {{convert|100|ft|m}} away. Starting in 1930, many efforts to halt the erosion were attempted, including adding over a million cubic yards of loose sand, massive [[sandbag]]s, and steel and concrete walls. After nearly 70 years it became apparent that fighting the erosion was a never-ending battle, and the decision was made to move the lighthouse away from the sea.

The formerly [[Heritage conservation in Hong Kong|Grade-I Listed]] [[Murray House]] in [[Hong Kong]] (built 1844) was dismantled in 1982 to make way for the [[Bank of China Tower (Hong Kong)|Bank of China Tower]]. It was rebuilt brick-by-brick at [[Stanley, Hong Kong|Stanley]] in 2000. The relocation process, nonetheless, was said to have failed to meet 'the international standard of preservation'. Certain architectural features, such as the chimneys and stone columns were lost and was replaced with features taken from other contemporary buildings. Much of the structure, furthermore, was reconstructed to be held up by an added steel-and-concrete core that which was not representative of how it once existed. The Grade-I listed status has thus since been withdrawn. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/construction_archive/major_reference_pdf.aspx?id=265 Heritage Preservation: Hong Kong and Overseas Experiences], p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3,200-year-old [[Statue of Ramesses II (Mit Rahina)|Statue of Ramesses II]] in [[Cairo]] was moved on 25 August 2006 from [[Ramses Square]] to a new [[museum]] site. The [[statue]] was slowly being damaged by [[pollution]] and was in an area where it was difficult for people to visit. The move of the statue, which measures {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=off}} high and weighs around 83 tonnes (91 short tons) was broadcast live on Egyptian television. Transported whole on the back of two trucks, the statue had previously been cut into eight pieces when it was moved from its excavation site in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News. 25 August 2006. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/5282414.stm Giant Ramses statue gets new home]". Accessed 27 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, [[Hamilton Grange National Memorial]], the 1802 home of [[Alexander Hamilton]] in [[New York City]], was relocated from a cramped lot on Convent Avenue to a more spacious setting facing West 141st Street in nearby [[St. Nicholas Park]], where it is currently undergoing a complete [[Building restoration|restoration]]. It is actually the second time the 298-ton mansion has been moved. In 1889, it was relocated from its original site on West 143rd Street to a church's property two blocks away.

The Nathaniel Lieb House (1969), by architect [[Robert Venturi]], was moved by barge from [[Long Beach Island, New Jersey]] to [[Glen Cove, New York]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Tammy La Gorce and A. G. Sulzberger, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/14/nyregion/14lieb.html?_r=0 "To save a Venturi house, it is moved,"] ''The New York Times'', March 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, due to construction works on Fuzuli Street the House of famous Baku millionaire, Isa bey Hajinski, in [[Baku]] ([[Azerbaijan]]), which was built in 1908, was moved 10 m to protect it as historical and architectural monument. The weight of this building is 18,000 tonnes. It was the heaviest building in the world ever moved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anspress.com/index.php?a=2&amp;lng=ru&amp;nid=197094 Впервые в Азербайджане передвинут здание]&lt;/ref&gt;

The William Walker House, built circa 1904, was relocated 500 feet when the new owner, [[Thomas Tull]], decided to preserve the home instead of demolishing it. The move took place in August 2016. The house was designed by architects [[Longfellow, Alden &amp; Harlow]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]. 19 January 2016.

===Reassembly moves===
The [[Warder Mansion]], the only surviving Washington, D.C. building by architect [[H. H. Richardson]], was saved from demolition in 1923 by [[George Oakley Totten, Jr.]] Totten bought the exterior stone &amp;ndash; except the main doorway, which reportedly went to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] &amp;ndash; and much of the interior woodwork, and transported it, piece by piece, in his [[Model T Ford]]. He reassembled the building about 1.5 miles north of its original site, and converted it into an apartment house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newcolumbiaheights.blogspot.com/2011/06/warder-mansion-house-that-was-moved.html The Warder Mansion] from NewColumbiaHeights.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, Thomas C. Williams Jr. bought a 15th-century [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] [[manor house]], [[Agecroft Hall]], which stood by the [[River Irwell]] in [[Pendlebury]], [[England]]. The hall was disassembled, crated and transported to [[Richmond, Virginia]], where it was reassembled as the centrepiece of a Tudor estate on the banks of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agecrofthall.com/ Agecroft Hall: A Tudor estate originally built in 15th-century England, now a Richmond Virginia museum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The 16th-century [[Priory Park, Warwick|Warwick Priory]] in [[Warwick, England]] was bought by [[Alexander W. Weddell|Alexander and Virginia Weddell]] in 1926, and relocated in the same manner. Architect [[Henry G. Morse]] oversaw both moves. He designed additions to the reassembled priory, inspired by [[Sulgrave Manor]] and [[Wormleighton Manor]]. The expanded building was renamed [[Virginia House]], and stands next door to Agecroft Hall.

Newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] purchased and attempted to relocate two [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] [[monastery|monasteries]] during his travels in [[Spain]], but neither was completed during his lifetime. The first was built about 1141, and found abandoned by Hearst in 1925. He purchased the ruin and attempted to ship it to his home in [[California]], [[San Simeon]]. The crates, however, were detained by customs officials in [[New York City]], and due to his deteriorating finances during the [[Great Depression]], Hearst was unable to complete the shipment. The stones were purchased in 1951 and reassembled in [[Florida]] as a tourist attraction. In 1964, the building was purchased by a local [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] diocese and restored to its original purpose as the [[St. Bernard de Clairvaux Episcopal Church (North Miami Beach)|Church of St. Bernard de Clairvaux]].&lt;ref&gt;South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

[[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst]]'s second attempt at relocating a monastery was in 1931, when he found the closed Santa Maria de Ovila Monastery, built around 1200. He purchased the structure, disassembled it and successfully shipped it to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], but was unable to rebuild the monastery. Hearst eventually gave the stones to the city of San Francisco, where they sat for decades in [[Golden Gate Park]]. Eventually some of the stones were acquired by the [[Abbey of New Clairvaux]] in Vina, California, where they are currently being reconstructed;&lt;ref&gt;National Trust for Historic Preservation.

[[Abu Simbel]] is an [[archaeological site]] comprising two massive rock [[temple]]s completed in 1244 [[BCE]], on the western bank of the [[Nile River|Nile]] in southern [[Egypt]]. Construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]] would have submerged the temples beneath the waters of [[Lake Nasser]]. In 1959, an international donation campaign began to save the monuments of [[Nubia]]: the southernmost relics of this ancient human civilisation. The salvage of the Abu Simbel temples began in 1964, and cost US $80 million. Between 1964 and 1968, the entire site was cut into large blocks, dismantled and reassembled in a new location &amp;ndash; 65&amp;nbsp;m higher and 200&amp;nbsp;m back from the river, in what many consider one of the greatest feats of archaeological engineering. Today, thousands of tourists visit the temples daily. Guarded convoys of buses and cars depart twice a day from [[Aswan]], the nearest city. Many visitors also arrive by plane, at an airfield that was specially constructed for the temple complex.

On 18 April 1968, [[John Rennie (engineer)|John Rennie]]'s [[London Bridge (Lake Havasu City)|London Bridge]] (which had replaced the original bridge in 1831) was sold to the [[United States|American]] entrepreneur [[Robert P. McCulloch]] of [[McCulloch Oil]] for the sum of [[United States dollar|$]]2,460,000. The bridge was reconstructed at [[Lake Havasu City, Arizona]], and opened on 10 October 1971. Not all of the bridge was transported to America, as some was kept behind in lieu of tax duties. The version of London Bridge that was rebuilt at Lake Havasu consists of a concrete frame with stones from the old (but not the original) London Bridge used as cladding. It spans a [[canal]] that leads from Lake Havasu to Thomson Bay, and forms the centrepiece of a [[theme park]] in English style, complete with [[Tudor Revival architecture|mock-Tudor]] [[shopping mall]]. The bridge has become one of [[Arizona]]'s biggest tourist attractions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.outwestnewspaper.com/london.html Retrieved on 2008-03-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum collections==
&lt;!-- should be prosified, will do soon --&gt;
Several [[museum]]s, particularly [[open-air museums]], move historic buildings into their surroundings, with some dedicated to showing what life was like in previous centuries called [[living history]].

Museums that have transported and reconstructed old buildings and structures include:
* [[Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings]], [[Bromsgrove]], [[Worcestershire]], England; centered on a collection of buildings which had to be relocated from their original sites and restored, along with a fully functioning [[windmill]], a 1940s [[Prefabricated housing|prefab]], and the UK national collection of [[telephone kiosk]]s.
* [[Beamish Museum]], [[Stanley, County Durham]], England; shows what life was like in a typical northern town in the early 20th century.
* [[Black Country Living Museum]], [[Dudley]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], England; forty-two separate displays, including houses, shops and public buildings rebuilt to create a single early 20th century street.
* [[The Cloisters]], [[New York City]], a branch of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] dedicated to the art and architecture of the European [[Middle Ages]].
* [[Greenfield Village]] ([[The Henry Ford|The Henry Ford Museum]]), [[Dearborn, Michigan]], which contains many historically significant buildings from around the United States, as well as a 17th-century farm from [[Cotswold (district)|Cotswold]], England.

==Relocation of towers==
In the past, it was not uncommon that as well free-standing as guyed radio towers were dismantled and rebuilt at another site. In some cases they were rebuilt just a few metres away from their original site, but in others far away from their original site. In first case these towers were nearly all part of a directional antenna system for long- and medium-wave for which the regulations of directional patterns were changed and the best way to fulfill it, was to build either a new tower or to dismantle one tower and to rebuild it on the new site. It was also done that a tower was dismantled and then used for the upper parts of a new radio tower. This was done for example with the masts at [[Sender Donebach]] in 1982 and with the wooden tower of [[Transmitter Ismaning]] in 1934.
After World War II some radio towers in former East Germany were dismantled by Soviet occupants and rebuilt in former Soviet Union, the most famous example herefore is [[Goliath transmitter]].
It is also common that electricity pylons are dismantled and rebuilt at a new site.
Also small observation towers built of steel were sometimes dismantled for renovation and afterwards rebuilt.

The tallest structure ever relocated is [[BREN Tower]]. In 1959 a 280-metre-tall radio mast was relocated at Felsberg-Berus without dismantling.{{Citation needed|reason=the link provided goes nowhere (http://www.dxradio-ffm.de/web//TafelEuropa1.jpg)|date=April 2014}}

==Financing building relocation==
Although smaller projects are usually paid for in cash, larger projects such as the relocation of a house to a new site are typically financed by banks. Finance is often a major problem faced by project managers as the house needs to be paid for prior to leaving its current site, but the lender for the project cannot take security over the house until it is complete and on the new site. This creates a short-term cashflow problem that unhinges many projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1907">'''Taps''' (commonly mistaken as tips), the game, is a game where an object, such as a ball, is caught and thrown in one jump from one [[Player (game)|player]] to another.

Tapping is a term used in a variety of ways in a number of [[game]]s.  Although the exact meaning varies, it generally either refers to either the physical action of actually [[touch]]ing something, or to the "using up" of the [[resources]] of some element of the game.

== Collectible card games==
In [[collectible card games]] such as ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' to tap a card means to use it so that it cannot be used again in that player's turn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wizards.com/magic/rules/MagicRulebook_10E_EN.pdf ''Magic: the Gathering'' basic rulebook]&lt;/ref&gt; The visual indication of the tapped status is represented by turning the card 90 degrees to the right.

On cards since ''[[Revised (Magic: The Gathering)|Revised edition]]'' (1994), tapping has been represented by a symbol, though this is not unique to the game of Magic: The Gathering. {{US patent|5662332}} was filed by [[Wizards of the Coast]] to patent the mechanics of some aspects of collectible card games, including tapping.

Mechanics similar to tapping are used in many collectible card games, often involving the same 90 degree card rotation.  For example, this act is referred to as ''[[Set (gaming)|setting]]'' in ''[[Ophidian 2350]]'', while it is known as ''committing'' in the ''[[Universal Fighting System]]''.  In the medieval-Japan-themed ''[[Legend of the Five Rings]]'', the mechanism is called "bowing".  A few games, such as the ''[[City of Heroes Collectible Card Game]]'', use several different rotational increments (90, 180, and 270 degrees), each denoting a different card status.

Ja‘far al-Sulamī al-Armanāzī al-Ṣūrī''' ({{lang|ar|أم علي تقية بنت أبى الفرج غيث بن على بن عبد السلام بن محمد بن جافر السلامية الأرمنازية السورية}}), also known as '''Sitt al-Ni‘m''' ({{lang|ar|ست النعم}}) (born Damascus 505/1111, died, probably in Egypt, 579/1183-4), was a poet and scholar, the most prominent female student of [[Abū Ṭāhir al-Silafī]], the leading educator in Egypt in his day. 'Several sources acknowledge her as woman of talent and wit, who composed ''[[Qasida|qaṣīdas]]'' and short poems.'&lt;ref&gt;Delia Cortese, 'Transmitting sunnī learning in Fāṭimid Egypt: the female voices', in ''26th Congress of the Union Européenne des Arabisants et Islamisants (UEAI 26), 12-16 Sep 2012, Basel, Switzerland'', accessed from http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/13680/ (p. 14).&lt;/ref&gt;

Taqiyya's husband was Fāḍil b. Ḥamdūn al-Ṣūrī (born Damascus 490/1097, died Alexandria 568/1172), himself a noted scholar; with him she had the son [[Abu’l-Ḥasan ‘Alī b. Fāḍil b. Ḥamdūn al-Ṣūrī]] (b. Ṣūr, d. 603/1206), who also became a noted scholar.

Among the few poems of Taqiyya's that survive is an epigram on wine the she sent to [[Al-Muzaffar Umar]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is nothing good in wine, though a paradisial perk&lt;br&gt;
It ferments the sane, bonkers his mind and instils in him a falling fear.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When al-Muzaffar responded that Taqiyya was speaking from experience, she composed a poem on war, to show that experience was not required to compose poetry on a theme.&lt;ref&gt;''Classical Poems by Arab Women: A Bilingual Anthology'', ed. and trans. by Abdullah al-Udhari (London: Saqi Books, 1999), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ta’Oi''' (Ta’Oih, Ta Oi) is a [[Katuic languages|Katuic]] [[dialect chain]] of [[Salavan Province|Salavan]] and [[Sekong Province|Sekong]] provinces in [[Laos]], and in [[Thừa Thiên–Huế Province|Thừa Thiên-Huế]] province in [[Vietnam]] (Sidwell 2005:12).

==Varieties==
Sidwell (2005) lists the following varieties of Ta’Oi, which is a name applied to speakers of various related dialects.

*'''Ta’Oi proper'''
*'''Ong/Ir/Talan'''
*'''Chatong''' is spoken about 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Sekong. It has been recorded only by [[Theraphan Luangthongkum|Theraphan L-Thongkum]].
*'''Kriang''' (Ngkriang, Ngeq) is spoken by up to 4,000 people living in villages between Tatheng and Sekong, such as Ban Chakamngai.
*'''Kataang''' (Katang) is a dialect that has been documented by Michel Ferlus, [[Gerard Diffloth]], and other linguists. It is not to be confused with the [[Bru language|Bru]] dialect of Katang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mon-Khmer Classification (draft) |url=http://sealang.net/sala/mk-class.htm |access-date=24 June 2018 |publisher=SEAlang |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest reference to the Blue Jackal can be found in ''[[Panchatantra]]'', a collection of stories which depict animals in human situations (see [[anthropomorphism]], [[Talking animals in fiction]]). In each of the stories every animal has a [[Personality psychology|"personality"]] and each story ends in a moral.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==The story==
The story of the Blue Jackal known through [[Oral tradition|oral transmission]] doesn't vary much from one part of [[India]] to another.  Although the creature is known variously as ''Chandru'', ''Neelaakanth'' or ''Neela Gidhar'' (literally, ''Blue Jackal'').

! The Story of the Blue Jackal is one of a story in panchatantra
|-
| One evening when it was dark, a hungry [[golden jackal|jackal]] went in search of food in a large village close to his home in the [[jungle]].  The local [[dog]]s didn't like Jackals and chased him away so that they could make their owners proud by killing a beastly jackal.  The jackal ran as fast as he could, and not looking where he was going fell into a bucket of indigo [[dye]] outside the home of the cloth dyer.  The dogs ran further and the jackal climbed out of the bucket, wet but unharmed.

The jackal continued into the jungle and saw the [[Asiatic lion|lion]], King of the Jungle. The Lion asked him who he was and the jackal seeing that he had now turned blue declared himself as ''Chandru'' - protector of all the animals in the jungle.  ''Chandru'' told the lion that he would only continue to protect the jungle if all the animals would give him food and shelter.

Soon ''Chandru'' was sought for advice from animals from other jungles and animals sat at his feet and brought him the best of food.  But as happens every year in [[India]], the [[Monsoon]] came, and slowly but surely, the blue dye had run off ''Chandru's'' coat and he was just a mangy jackal again.  The animals realised this and chased the jackal far into the jungle, where he was never seen again.&lt;ref name="panchatantra.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060505220539/http://www.bolokids.com/2006/0049.htm The Blue Jackal : A Panchtantra Story by Swapna Dutta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  &lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030210213402/http://www.indiaoz.com.au/hinduism/kids_corner/panchatantra/panchatantra4.shtml A - Z Hinduism - Panchatantra Stories&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Blue Jackal|url=https://www.tell-a-tale.com/panchatantra-the-blue-jackal/|website=Tell-A-Tale|publisher=Tell-A-Tale|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMX was originally developed and maintained by OSCAR (Open Standards for Container/Content Allowing Re-use), a special interest group of [[Localization Industry Standards Association|LISA]] (Localization Industry Standards Association), and first released in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://xml.coverpages.org/tmxSpec971212.html | title=TMX Format Specifications Version 1.0 | date=25 November 1997 | publisher=Open Standards for Container/Content Allowing Re-use (OSCAR) | accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current version of the specification is 1.4b&lt;ref name="spec"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gala-global.org/oscarStandards/tmx/tmx14b.html | title=TMX 1.4b Specification | last1=Savourel | first1=Yves | last2=Lommel | first2=Arle | date=26 April 2005 | publisher=The Localisation Industry Standards Association (LISA) | accessdate=25 June 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130112210434/http://www.gala-global.org/oscarStandards/tmx/tmx14b.html | archivedate=12 January 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows for the recreation of the original source and target documents from the TMX data. A working draft of TMX 2.0 was released for public comment in March 2007 but no work on the new version has been done since. In March 2011 LISA was declared insolvent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gala-global.org/lisa-oscar-standards | title=LISA OSCAR Standards | publisher=Globalization and Localization Association (GALA) | accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result its standards were moved under a [[Creative Commons]] license and the standards specification relocated.&lt;ref name="spec"/&gt;

TMX forms part of the [[Open Architecture]] for XML Authoring and Localization ([[OAXAL]]) reference architecture.

'''Tuvan''' (Tuvan: {{lang|tyv|тыва дыл}}, ''tıwa dıl''; [[Help:IPA|[tʰɯˈʋa tɯl]]]), also known as '''Tuvinian''', '''Tyvan''' or '''Tuvin''', is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] spoken in the Republic of [[Tuva]] in south-central [[Siberia]] in [[Russia]]. The language has borrowed a great number of roots from the [[Mongolian language]], [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan]]  and more recently from the [[Russian language]]. There are small diaspora groups of [[Tuvan people]] that speak distinct dialects of Tuvan in the [[People's Republic of China]] and in [[Mongolia]].
&lt;!--==Geographic distribution==--&gt;

== History ==
While this history focuses on mostly the people of Tuva, many linguists argue that language is inevitably intertwined with the socio-historical situation of a language itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vanishing Voices|last=Nettle, Romaine|first=Daniel, Suzanne|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest record of Tuvan is from the early 19th century by ''Wūlǐyǎsūtái zhìè'' (烏里雅蘇台志略), [[Julius Klaproth|Klaproth]] 1823, [[Matthias Castrén|Castrén]] 1857, [[Katanov]] and [[Vasily Radlov|Radlov]] ''etc ''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.dl.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2261/43632/1/ioc159007.pdf]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} Todoriki 2011: 234–230.&lt;/ref&gt; The name Tuva goes back as early as the publication of the Secret History of the Mongols. The Tuva (as they refer to themselves) have also been referred to as Soyons, Soyots or Uriankhais historically.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Tuvan people have been ruled by China, Russia, and Mongolia for thousands of years. Their most recent time of independence was from 1921-1944, when they were considered the Tuvan’s Peoples Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="Let me hear your khoomei ringing out; Tuva's cultural history."|journal=The Economist|volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sources say there has been extreme tension between the Soviet Union/Russian Federation government and leaders in the Tuvan nation since 1944, when Tuva lost its independence to the USSR. In 1990, violence broke out between Tuvans and the USSR government.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title="Support for Separatism in Ethnic Republics of the Russian Federation"|journal=Europe-Asia Studies|volume=60 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study completed by social scientists Louk Hagendoorn, Edwin Poppe, and Anca Minescu in 2008, the Tuvan people wanted to be as independent as possible from the Russian federation, following the collapse of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They especially emphasized their want for independence in terms of their language and culture. The study demonstrates that the reason behind this was partially based on prejudice. The many minority ethnic and linguistic groups in Russia compete for economic resources and hold closely on to their individual identities, by emphasizing the importance of language and culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since 2000, the Russian federation has been trying to reduce separatist tendencies of ethnic minorities in Russia, but the tendencies persist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Classification ==
Tuvan (also spelled Tyvan) is linguistically classified as a Northeastern or Siberian Turkic language, closely related to several other Siberian Turkic languages including [[Khakas language|Khakas]] and [[Altai language]]s. Its closest relative is the moribund [[Tofa language|Tofa]].

Tuvan, as spoken in Tuva, is principally divided into four dialect groups; Western, Central, Northeastern, Southeastern.
* Central: forms the basis of the literary language and includes Ovyur and Bii-Khem subdialects. The geographical centrality of this dialect meant it was similar to the language spoken by most Tuvans, whether or not exactly the same.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Harrison, K. David. (2001). "Topics in the Phonology and Morphology of Tuvan." Doctoral Dissertation, Yale University. (OCLC catalog #51541112).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Western: can be found spoken near the upper course of the Khemchik River. It is influenced by the [[Altai language]].
* Northeastern, also known as the Todzhi dialect, is spoken near the upper course of the Bii-Khem River. The speakers of this dialect utilize nasalization. It contains a large vocabulary related to hunting and reindeer breeding not found in the other dialects.
* Southeastern: shows the most influence from the [[Mongolian language]].

Other dialects include those spoken by the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]], the [[Tsengel people)|Tsengel]] and the [[Dukha]] bands of Tuvans, but currently these uncommon dialects are not comprehensively documented. Different dialects of the language exist across the geographic region in which Tuvan is spoken. Dr. David K. Harrison, who completed his dissertation on the Tuvan language in 2001, argues that the divergence of these dialects relates to the nomadic nature of the Tuvan nation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One subset is the Jungar-Tuvan language, originating in the Altay mountains in the Western region of Mongolia. There is no accurate number of Jungar-Tuvan speakers because most currently reside in China, and the Chinese include Tuvan speakers as Mongolians in their census.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mawkanuli|first=Talant|date=1 July 2010|title=The Jungar Tuvas: Language and national identity in the PRC|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02634930120104654|journal=Central Asian Survey|volume=20|issue=4|doi=10.1080/02634930120104654|pmid=|access-date=18 September 2016|via=Academic Search Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The distinction between initial bilabial and alveolar stops is based on [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] for most speakers and voicing for others.
#{{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/ts/}} are found in some Russian [[loanword]]s.

=== Vowels ===
[[Vowel]]s in Tuvan exist in three varieties: short, long and short with low [[pitch (psychophysics)|pitch]]. Tuvan long vowels have a duration that is at least (and often more than) twice as long as that of short vowels. Contrastive low pitch may occur on short vowels, and when it does, it causes them to increase in duration by at least a half. When using low pitch, Tuvan-speakers employ a pitch that is at the very low end of their modal voice pitch. For some speakers, it is even lower and using what is phonetically known as [[creaky voice]]. When a vowel in a monosyllabic word has low pitch, speakers apply low pitch only to the first half of that vowel (e.g. {{IPA|[àt]}} 'horse'). That is followed by a noticeable pitch rise, as the speaker returns to modal pitch in the second half of the vowel.

The acoustic impression is similar to that of a rising tone like the rising [[pitch contour]] of the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] second tone, but the Tuvan pitch begins much lower. However, Tuvan is considered a [[pitch accent]] language with contrastive low pitch instead of a [[tonal language]]. When the low pitch vowel occurs in a multisyllabic word, there is no rising [[pitch contour]] or lengthening effect: {{IPA|[àdɯ]}} 'his/her/its horse'. Such low pitch vowels were previously referred to in the literature as either [[kargyraa]] or [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] vowels. Phonetic studies have demonstrated that the defining characteristic of such vowels is low pitch. See Harrison 2001 for a phonetic and acoustic study of Tuvan low pitch vowels.

In her PhD thesis, "Long Vowels in Mongolic Loanwords in Tuvan", Baiarma Khabtagaeva states that the history of long vowels is ambiguous. While the long vowels may originate from Mongolic languages, they could also be of Tuvan origin. In  most Mongolic languages, the quality of the long vowel changes depending on the quality of the second vowel in the conjunction. The only exception to this rule is if the conjunction is labial. The ancient Tuvan languages, in contrast, depended upon the first vowel rather than the second to determine the long vowels.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title="Long Vowels in Mongolic Loanwords in Tuvan"|journal=Turkic Languages|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khabtagaeva divided the transformation of these loanwords into two periods: the early layer and the late layer. The words in the early layer are words in which the Mongolic preserved the conjunction, the VCV conjunction was preserved but the long vowel still developed when it entered the Tuvan language, or the stress is on the last syllable and a long vowel in the loanword replaced a short vowel in the original word. The Late Layer includes loanwords in which the long vowel does not change when the word entered Tuvan.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Vowels may also be [[nasal vowel|nasalized]] in the environment of nasal consonants, but nasalization is non-contrastive. Most Tuvan vowels in word-initial syllables have a low pitch and do not contrast significantly with short and long vowels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Vowel harmony ====
Vowel harmony in Tuvan is exhibited in its phonology, [[subject-object-verb]] word order, [[head-final syntax]] and heavy use of multiverb constructions.&lt;ref&gt;Voinov, Vitaly. (2013). "Politeness Devices in the Tuvan Language." Doctoral Dissertation, University of Texas, Arlington.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuvan has two systems of vowel harmony that strictly govern the distribution of vowels within words and suffixes. Backness harmony, or what is sometimes called 'palatal' harmony, requires all vowels within a word to be either back or front. Rounding harmony, or what is sometimes called 'labial' harmony, requires a vowel to be rounded if it is a high vowel and appears in a syllable immediately following a rounded vowel. Low rounded vowels {{IPA|[ø] [o]}} are restricted to the first syllable of a word, and a vowel in a non-initial syllable may be rounded only if it meets the conditions of rounding harmony (it must both be a high vowel {{IPA|[y] [u]}} and be preceded by a rounded vowel). See Harrison 2001 for a detailed description of Tuvan vowel harmony systems.

== Grammar ==
=== Morphology ===
Tuvan builds morphologically complex words by adding suffixes. For example, {{IPA|[teʋe]}} is 'camel', {{IPA|[teʋe-ler]}} (hyphens indicate morpheme boundaries) is 'camels', {{IPA|[teʋe-ler-im]}} is 'my camels', {{IPA|[teʋe-ler-im-den]}} is 'from my camels'.

Tuvan marks [[noun]]s with six [[declension|cases]]: genitive, accusative, dative, ablative, locative, and allative. Each case suffix has a rich variety of uses and meanings, only the most basic uses and meanings are shown here.

{|class="wikitable"
|Teve||{{IPA|[teʋe]}}||[[Nominative case]]||'camel' (no suffix)
|-
|Teve + /-NIŋ/||{{IPA|[teʋeniŋ]}}||[[Genitive case]]||'of the camel' (the [ŋ] phonetic symbol is pronounced as English 'ng' in 'sing')
|-
|Teve + /-NI/||{{IPA|[teveni]}}||[[Accusative case]]||'the camel' (definite meaning, direct object of verb, as in "I saw THE camel.")
|-
|Teve + /-KA/||{{IPA|[teʋeɡe]}}||[[Dative case]]||'for the camel' or 'at the camel' (in the past tense)
|-
|Teve + /-DAn/||{{IPA|[teʋeden]}}||[[Ablative case]]||'from the camel' or 'than a/the camel' (as in "taller than a/the camel")
|-
|Teve + /-DA/||{{IPA|[teʋede]}}||[[Locative case]]||'at the camel' or 'in the camel' (also used to show possession in some contexts)
|-
|Teve + /-Je/||{{IPA|[teʋeʒe]}}||[[Allative case]]||'to(wards) the camel' (the phonetic symbol {{IPA|[ʒ]}} is pronounced as the 's' in English 'pleasure')
|-
|Teve + /-DIvA/||{{IPA|[teʋediʋe]}}||[[Allative case]]||'to(wards) the camel' (this is an obsolete or dialectical version of this case)
|}

[[Verb]]s in Tuvan take a number of endings to mark [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]].  [[Auxiliary verb]]s are also used to modify the verb. For a detailed scholarly study of auxiliary verbs in Tuvan and related languages, see Anderson 2004.

=== Syntax ===
Tuvan employs [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] word order. For example, {{IPA|[teʋe siɡen tʃipken]}} (camel hay eat-PAST) "The camel ate the hay."

== Vocabulary ==
Tuvan vocabulary is largely Turkic in origin but marked by a large number of Mongolian [[loanword]]s.  The language has also borrowed several Mongolian suffixes.  In addition, there exist [[Ket language|Ketic]] and [[Samoyed languages|Samoyedic]] substrata. A Tuvan talking dictionary is produced by the [[Living Tongues Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tuvan Talking Dictionary|url = http://tuvan.swarthmore.edu/|website = tuvan.swarthmore.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Writing system ==
The current Tuvan alphabet is a modified version of the [[Russian alphabet]], with three additional letters: ң (Latin "ng" or [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] {{IPA|[ŋ]}}), Өө (Latin "ö", {{IPA|[ø]}}), Үү (Latin "ü", IPA {{IPA|[y]}}). The sequence of the alphabet follows Russian exactly, with ң located after Russian Н, Ө after О, and Ү after У.

А Б В Г Д Е Ё Ж З И Й К Л М Н Ң О Ө П Р С Т У Ү Ф Х Ц Ч Ш Щ Ъ Ы Ь Э Ю Я

а б в г д е ё ж з и й к л м н ң о ө п р с т у ү ф х ц ч ш щ ъ ы ь э ю я

The letters Е and Э are used in a special way.  Э is used for the short {{IPA|/e/}} sound at the beginning of words while Е is used for the same sound in the middle and at the end of words.  Е is used at the beginning of words, mostly of Russian origin, to reflect the standard Russian pronunciation of that letter, {{IPA|/je/}}. Additionally, ЭЭ is used in the middle and at the end of words for the long {{IPA|/e/}} sound.

The letter ъ is used to indicate pitch accent, as in эът ''èt'' 'eat'.

=== Historic scripts ===
==== Mongol script ====
In the past, Tuvans used Mongolian as their written language.

[[Mongolian script]] was later developed by [[Nikolaus Poppe]] to suit the Tuvan language. This is the first known written form of the Tuvan language.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Otgonbayar Chuluunbaatar: ''Einführung in die mongolischen Schriften.'' Buske Verlag, Hamburg 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-87548-500-4}}, S. 70. "Daher wurde der Sprachforscher Nikolaus Poppe von der tuwinischen Regierung mit der Entwicklung eines für die eigene Sprache geeigneten Alphabets beauftragt. "&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tuvan Latin ====
[[File:Coat of arms of Tuvan People's Republic (1933-1939).jpg|thumbnail|Example of Latin-based alphabet on the Tuvan People's Republic coat of arms. It says "PYGY TELEGEJNIꞐ PROLETARLARЬ POLGAŞ TARLATKAN ARATTARЬ KATTЬƵЬꞐAR".]]
The Latin-based alphabet for Tuvan was devised in 1930 by a Tuvan Buddhist monk, Mongush [[Lopsang-Chinmit]] (a.k.a. Lubsan Zhigmed).  A few books and newspapers, including primers intended to teach adults to read, were printed using this writing system. Lopsang-Chinmit was later executed in Stalinist purges on 31 December 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Mänchen-Helfen|first =Otto|title =Journey to Tuva|publisher =Ethnographics Press University of Southern California|year =1992 |location = Los Angeles|pages =133n |isbn = 1-878986-04-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 1943, this Latin-based alphabet was replaced by a Cyrillic-based one, which is still in use to the present day. In the post-Soviet era, Tuvan and other scholars have taken a renewed interest in the history of Tuvan letters.

=== Transliteration ===
There is no official transliteration standard for transforming the Cyrillic-based Tuvan alphabet into Latin.  Common schemes in use by various media sources rely upon international standards for transliterating other Cyrillic languages such as Russian while scholars of Turkology generally rely upon common Turkic-styled spelling.

Zabana is considered a developing language (EGIDS 5) which means that the language is in vigorous use, with literature in a standardized form being used by some though this is not yet widespread or sustainable.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/kji|title=Zabana|newspaper=Ethnologue|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most spoken languages on Santa Isabel Island, competing with [[Cheke Holo language|Cheke Holo]]. There is a 30% to 60% literacy rate in Zabana as a first language and a 25% to 50% literacy rate in Zabana as a second language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  {{Infobox language

Zabana only contains open syllables, since there are no [[Consonant cluster|consonant clusters]] and geminate vowels in the language. It is important to note that [[Stress (linguistics)|vocal stress]] on a single phoneme does not exist in Zabana, instead certain syllables called penultimate syllables (the final syllable of a word that ends in a vowel) are stressed. When compared to the neighboring languages, it is also important to note that Zabana has fewer phonemes than its neighbors, in particular [[Kokota language|Kokota]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Sentence Structure ==
Zabana is a mainly a VSO (Verb, Subject, Object) language.

=== Declarative ===
Declarative sentences are denoted by a drop in intonation at the end of the sentence and the basic sentence structure or word ordering of a declarative sentence is shown below.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;
Example:Ghe manevaka ianimu neke
"but whiteman there stay"
Predicate, subject, direct object, oblique object&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Interrogative ===
There are four basic types of question sentences in Zabana: polar questions (yes/no), content questions, alternative questions, dubitative questions (rhetorical).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Polar Question: Denoted by a rise in intonation at the end of a sentence&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Content Questions: Denoted by the use of one of the four interrogative words and by a fall in intonation at the end of the question&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Alternative Questions: In Zabana they are usually request or open ended questions&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Honorific Language ===
There is a chiefly language form of Zabana which is used when addressing clan chiefs.

|suli gitau
|-
|Eye
|hiba
|nahali
|-
|Sleep
|epu
|megho
|-
|Fall
|riufu
|neukete
|}

=== Complex Sentences ===
Complex sentences in Zabana are formed when a conjoined clause is used in a sentence, by using one of the three different connectors: "nia", "ga", and "ba" which are "and", "or", and "but" respectively. The exception of this rule is the connecting particle "ghe" which is used to denote a conditional sentence or question and "nia" must be used to connect the pronoun and the proper noun together. "Ghe" can also be used in a complex sentence to link together two different proper nouns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Conditional Sentence ===
In Zabana there are two different types of conditional sentences: simple and counterfactual sentences. Both sentences use the particle "la" to denote that they are conditional sentences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Simple Conditional: Denoted by the use of the particle "to" along with the particle "la", simple conditional sentences state a hypothetical situation in Zabana.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;
Example: To nanarela ghatu e kotoro hofi ini
"If it rains today, the roof will leak."

* Counterfactual: States a situation where the condition is no fulfilled.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Example: Geke meha la ia vaka norao gela to lao ara kia
"If the boat had come yesterday, I would have gone to Kia."
