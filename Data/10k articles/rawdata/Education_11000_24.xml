'''The Academic Bill of Rights''' ('''ABOR''') is a document created and distributed by [[Students for Academic Freedom]] (SAF), a public advocacy group spun off from the [[David Horowitz Freedom Center|Center for the Study of Popular Culture]], a think tank founded by the conservative writer [[David Horowitz]]. The document was created as a foundational part of SAF's mission, to "end the political abuse of the university and to restore integrity to the academic mission as a disinterested pursuit of knowledge."

The Bill focuses on eight broad-based principles that call for an academic environment where decisions are made irrespective of one's personal political or religious beliefs. The Bill (and its drafting organization) have come under sharp attack, however, for using broad-based egalitarian principles and a self-identified "bipartisan" framework to promote what critics identify as an ideological agenda.

==The Bill's Eight Principles==
#All faculty shall be hired, fired, promoted and granted tenure  on the basis of their competence and appropriate knowledge  in the field of their expertise and, in the humanities, the social  sciences, and the arts, with a view toward fostering a plurality  of methodologies and perspectives. No faculty shall be hired  or fired or denied promotion or tenure on the basis of his  or her political or religious beliefs.
#No faculty member will be excluded from tenure, search and hiring  committees on the basis of their political or religious  beliefs.
#Students will  be graded solely on the basis of their reasoned answers and  appropriate knowledge of the subjects and disciplines they study, not on  the basis of their political or religious beliefs.
#Curricula and reading lists in the humanities and social sciences should  reflect the uncertainty and unsettled character of all human knowledge in these areas by providing students with dissenting sources  and viewpoints where appropriate. While teachers are and should  be free to pursue their own findings and perspectives in presenting  their views, they should consider and make their students aware  of other viewpoints. Academic disciplines should welcome a diversity  of approaches to unsettled questions.
#Exposing students to the spectrum of significant scholarly viewpoints  on the subjects examined in their courses is a major responsibility  of faculty. Faculty will not use their courses for the purpose  of political, ideological, religious or anti-religious indoctrination.
#Selection of speakers, allocation of funds for speakers  programs and other student activities will observe the principles  of academic freedom and promote intellectual pluralism.
#An environment conducive to the civil exchange of ideas being  an essential component of a free university, the obstruction  of invited campus speakers, destruction of campus literature or  other effort to obstruct this exchange will not be tolerated.
#Knowledge advances when individual scholars are left free to  reach their own conclusions about which methods, facts,  and theories have been validated by research. Academic institutions and professional  societies formed to advance knowledge within an area of research, maintain the integrity of the research process, and organize  the professional lives of related researchers serve as indispensable venues within which scholars circulate research findings and  debate their interpretation. To perform these functions  adequately, academic institutions and professional societies should maintain a posture  of organizational neutrality with respect to the substantive disagreements that divide researchers on questions within, or outside, their  fields of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentsforacademicfreedom.org/abor.html "Academic Bill of Rights"]. Students For Academic Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
A number of organizations representing a variety of political viewpoints have expressed pointed critique of both the ABOR's aims and its content.

One of the first organizations to come out in opposition to the bill was the [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP). While agreeing with the underlying principles of freedom, equality, and pluralism in the university community, the association said that the bill "infringes academic freedom in the very act of purporting to protect it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aaup.org/report/academic-bill-rights|title= Reports &amp; Publications: Academic Bill of Rights|publisher= AAUP| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;| date=December 2003|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individual academics regard the ABOR, along with the [[Santorum Amendment]], as a threat to [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bemidjistate.edu/dsiems/ID/teach.html Intelligent Design: Teach the Controversy?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910141925/http://www.bemidjistate.edu/dsiems/ID/teach.html |date=2006-09-10 }} Dann P. Siems, Assistant Professor Biology &amp; Integrative Studies, [[Bemidji State University]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have suggested that the ABOR may allow students to claim discrimination when tested on [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/bachmann_and_horowitz_and_the_academic_bill_of_rights/ Pharyngula::Bachmann and Horowitz and the "Academic Bill of Rights"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209194250/http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/bachmann_and_horowitz_and_the_academic_bill_of_rights/ |date=December 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moderate, libertarian, and conservative critics of the ABOR have asserted that it would open the door to a right wing version of the campus [[speech code]].  An article by [[David T. Beito]], [[Ralph E. Luker]] and [[KC Johnson]] in the ''Perspectives'' magazine of the [[American Historical Association]] warned that the ABOR "could snuff out all controversial discussion in the classroom. A campus governed by the ABOR would present professors with an impossible dilemma: either play it safe or risk administrative censure by saying something that might offend an overly sensitive student."
&lt;ref&gt;David T. Beito, K.C. Johnson, and Ralph E. Luker [http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2006/0603/0603vie2.cfm "The AHA's Double Standard on Academic Freedom"] ''Perspectives'', March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Library Association]] also opposed the ABOR, with members approving a resolution stating that the Bill "would impose extra-academic standards on academic institutions, directly interfering in course content, the classroom, the research process, and hiring and tenure decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=ifresolutions&amp;Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=164148|title=  Resolution in Support of Academic Freedom| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | date= January 25, 2006|website= American Library Association official site|publisher=American Library Association|accessdate = June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other groups have also opposed the ABOR, including the [[American Federation of Teachers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aft.org/about/resolution_detail.cfm?articleid=1399|title= Opposition to the So-called Academic Bill of Rights and Support for the Campaign for Free Exchange on Campus|author=&lt;!--Council resolution--&gt;|date= 2006| website= American Federation of Teachers official website| publisher= American Federation of Teachers| accessdate= June 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Coalition Against Censorship]] (NCAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ncac.org/resource/academic-bill-of-rights-a-wolf-in-sheeps-clothing/| title="Academic Bill Of Rights" – A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website= National Coalition Against Censorship official website|publisher= National Coalition Against Censorship|accessdate= June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Some left-leaning groups, including [[Refuse and Resist]],{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} and the [[AFL-CIO]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aflcio.org/About/Exec-Council/EC-Statements/Opposition-to-the-Misnamed-Academic-Bill-of-Rights|title= Opposition to the Misnamed "Academic Bill of Rights"|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= February 27, 2006|website=AFL-CIO official website |publisher= AFL-CIO|accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  expressed concern and criticism of the Bill, particularly warning against the regulatory oversight that the bill would place upon academic institutions, if passed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33146">The '''Acid Rain Program''' is a market-based initiative taken by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] in an effort to reduce overall atmospheric levels of [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxides]], which cause [[acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/ |title=Acid Rain |accessdate=2008-11-20 |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081118105620/http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/| archivedate= 18 November 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is an implementation of [[emissions trading]] that primarily targets [[fossil fuel power plant|coal-burning power plants]], allowing them to buy and sell emission permits (called "allowances") according to individual needs and costs. In 2011, the trading program that existed since 1995 was supplemented by four separate trading programs under the [[Cross-State Air Pollution Rule]] (CSAPR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/crossstaterule/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711010737/http://www.epa.gov/crossstaterule/ |archivedate=2011-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 21, 2012, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] issued its Opinion and Order in the appeal of the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) for two independent legal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=D.C.

A 2017 [[National Bureau of Economic Research|NBER]] paper found that the "Acid Rain Program caused lasting improvements in ambient air quality," reducing reduced mortality risk by 5% over 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barreca|first=Alan I.|last2=Neidell|first2=Matthew|last3=Sanders|first3=Nicholas J.|date=June 2017|title=Long-Run Pollution Exposure and Adult Mortality: Evidence from the Acid Rain Program|work=NBER Working Paper No. 23524 |doi=10.3386/w23524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Title IV of the [[Clean Air Act (1990)|1990 Clean Air Act]] established the allowance market system known today as the Acid Rain Program. Initially targeting only sulfur dioxide, Title IV set a decreasing cap on total SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions for each of the following several years, aiming to reduce overall emissions to 50% of 1980 levels. The program did not begin immediately, but was implemented in two stages: Phase I (starting January 1, 1995) and Phase II (starting January 1, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/acidrain.html "Reducing Acid Rain"], [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 set as its primary goal the reduction of annual SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 10 million tons below 1980 levels of about 18.9 million tons. To achieve these reductions by 2000, when a nationwide sulfur dioxide emissions cap of 8.95 million tons per year began, the law required a two phase tightening of operating restrictions placed on fossil fuel fired (e.g., coal, oil, natural gas) power plants. The operation and pricing of a market for emissions allowances would not be viable in the absence of an effective regulatory cap on the total number of allowances available.

===Scope of Phase I requirements===

In Phase I, half the total reductions were required by January 1, 1995, largely by requiring 110 electric power generating plants (261 units in 21 states) to cut sulfur dioxide emission rates to 2.5 [[pound (mass)|lbs]]/[[British thermal unit|million British thermal units (mmBtu)]]. Each of these generating units was identified by name and location, and a quantity of emissions allowances was specified in the statute in tons of allowable SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions per year.&lt;ref&gt;42 ''U.S. Code'' 7651c.&lt;/ref&gt;

For comparison, new generating units built since 1978 were required to limit sulfur dioxide to a "lowest achievable emissions rate" of about 0.6&amp;nbsp;lbs/mmBtu. Coal with 1.25% sulfur and 10,000 Btu/lb produces sulfur dioxide emissions of 2.5&amp;nbsp;lbs/mmBtu, with lower emissions produced by either lower sulfur content or higher Btu content.&lt;ref name="impact"&gt;U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. (1993). ''Impact of Acid Rain Controls on Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement: Programs and Workload''. Washington, D.C.: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an incentive for reducing emissions, for each ton of sulfur dioxide reduced below the applicable emissions limit, owners of a generating unit received an emissions allowance they could use at another unit, keep for future use, or sell. This legitimized a market for sulfur dioxide emissions allowances, administered by the [[Chicago Board of Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Jeffrey, and Rose Gutfeld. (1992). "CBOT Selected to Run Auction for Polluters," ''Wall Street Journal'', September 25, 1992, p. C1.&lt;/ref&gt; Units that installed [[flue-gas desulfurization]] equipment (e.g., [[scrubber]]s) or other "qualifying Phase I technology" which reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 90%, qualified for a two-year extension of the 1995 deadline, provided they owned allowances to cover their total actual emissions for each year of the extension period.

===Scope of Phase II requirements===

In Phase II, all fossil-fired units over 75 MWe were required to limit emissions of sulfur dioxide to 1.2&amp;nbsp;lbs/mmBtu by January 1, 2000. Thereafter, they were required to obtain an emissions allowance for each ton of sulfur dioxide emitted, subject to a mandatory fine of  $2,000.00 for each ton emitted in excess of allowances held. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) distributes allowances equivalent to 8.95 million tons each year (the emissions cap), based on calculations of historical Btu usage for each unit, and may allocate various small "bonus reserves" of allowances.

===Nitrogen oxide reduction===

The 1990 Amendments also required reductions in nitrogen oxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions at Phase I units.  The key factors in NO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; formation are flame temperature and oxygen levels present for combustion.&lt;ref&gt;Bretz, Elizabeth A. (1991). "New Boiler Designs for Utility Service," ''Electrical World'', May, pp. 44–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Installation of low-NO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; burner retrofits are the most common means of compliance, generally reducing emissions from uncontrolled levels by up to 50%.&lt;ref name="Bretz, Elizabeth A. 1991 pp. 51-59"&gt;Bretz, Elizabeth A. (1991). "Equipment Options for Meeting the New Clean-Air Laws,"  ''Electrical World'', October, pp. 51–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Many utilities complied with requirements by installing stack-gas scrubbers and low-NO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; burners at the same time. Low-NO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; burner technology was readily available, and considerably less expensive than installation of scrubbers,&lt;ref&gt;Smock, Robert. (1991). "Utilities Struggle with Acid Rain Control Compliance Decisions," ''Power Engineering''. August, pp. 17–22.&lt;/ref&gt; so control of NO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; was considered less demanding by most electric utilities.

==Compliance strategies==

The market based SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allowance trading component of the Acid Rain Program was intended to allow utilities to adopt the most cost effective strategy to reduce SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Every Acid Rain Program operating permit outlines specific requirements and compliance options chosen by each source. Affected utilities also were required to install systems that continuously monitor emissions of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, and other related pollutants in order to track progress, ensure compliance, and provide credibility to the trading component of the program. Monitoring data is transmitted to EPA daily via telecommunications systems.

Strategies for compliance with air quality controls have been major components of electric utility planning and operations since the mid-1970s, affecting choice of fuels, technologies and locations for construction of new generating capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Michael S. (1980). ''Regional Interconnections, The Western Systems Coordinating Council, Regional Reliability, Economy and Efficiency''. In N. Wengert and R.M. Lawrence, ''Regional Factors in Siting and Planning Energy Facilities in the Eleven Western States. A Report to the Western Interstate Energy Board''. Fort Collins, CO: Colorado State University Experiment Station.&lt;/ref&gt; Utility strategies for compliance with new sulfur dioxide standards included a mix of options with varying financial costs:&lt;ref&gt;Bretz, Elizabeth A. (1991). "New Boiler Designs for Utility Service," ''Electrical World'', May, pp. 44-49; Bretz, Elizabeth A. (1991). "Equipment Options for Meeting the New Clean-Air Laws,"  ''Electrical World'', October, pp. 51-59; Habiger, Kenneth, and Ronald Ott (1989). "Fluidized-Bed Combustion:  Retrofit, New Plant Option," ''Electrical World'', May, pp. 62-64; Platt, J.B. (1991). "Scrub Versus Trade:  Enemies or Allies?"  Presented to the EPRI-EPA-DOE Sulfur Dioxide Control Symposium, Washington, DC, December 3; U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration. (1991a). Annual Outlook for U.S. Electric Power 1991. Washington, DC:  USGPO.&lt;/ref&gt;

* several existing and new stack-gas scrubbing and clean coal technologies;
* switching to all, or blending high-sulfur coal with, low-sulfur coal;
* switching to all natural gas, or [[cofiring]] coal and natural gas;
* "trimming," or reducing annual hours of plant utilization;
* retiring old units;
* repowering existing units with new coal or non-coal boilers;
* purchasing or transferring emissions allowances from other units;
* increasing demand-side management and conservation; or
* bulk power purchases from other utilities or non-utility generators from units using coal or other fuels.

Some coal cleaning may occur in combination with other actions such as scrubbing, or blending coals with varying sulfur content, but utilities generally prefer that coal suppliers bear the costs of cleaning operations. Some observers estimated 20% - 30% of the sulfur can be removed through coal cleaning or blending, and 50%–70% taken out with emissions control equipment.&lt;ref name="Bretz, Elizabeth A. 1991 pp. 51-59"/&gt;

For Phase II compliance the options were numerous, but for Phase I they were constrained by the time available to implement a decision. Because it takes 3–5 years to design and build a scrubber at an existing coal-fired unit, and longer to repower or build a new facility (e.g., 6–11 years for coal, 10–14 years for nuclear units),&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Michael S., and Norman Wengert. (1980). ''Environmental, Legal and Political Constraints on Power Plant Siting in the Southwestern United States. A Report to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory''. Fort Collins, CO:  Colorado State University Experiment Station.&lt;/ref&gt; electric utility decision options for Phase I plants were limited to scrubbing, switching fuels, purchasing or transferring emissions allowances to allow continued use of high-sulfur coal, retiring units, or trimming unit utilization and substituting capacity from another source.

Delays in allocating "early scrub" bonus credits and scheduling of the first auction of emissions allowances in March 1993&lt;ref&gt;''Coal Outlook'', February 4, 1991, p. 3; November 2, 1992, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; effectively removed these incentives from actual compliance decision making of most electric utilities. Because of the time it takes to build air pollution control equipment, financial and contractual commitments to scrubbers had to be made by summer 1992 if plant modifications were to be operational in time to meet new standards in 1995. Thus, decisions had to be made before price and allocation of emissions allowances were known. Consequently, most scrubber projects to meet the 1995 deadline were well under way by fall of 1992.

===Windfalls===

Of the 261 units at 110 plant locations affected by Phase I emission limitations, five were oil-fired, five coal-fired units were retired, and one coal-fired unit was placed on cold standby status prior to passage of the legislation in 1990. The 6 inactive coal-fired units were statutory recipients of a total of 36,020 tons of Phase I sulfur dioxide emissions allowances.

This marketable windfall was estimated by the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) in 1991 to be worth $665 to $736 per ton,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration. (1991). ''Annual Outlook for U.S. Electric Power 1991''. Washington, DC:  USGPO.&lt;/ref&gt; totaling $23.9 to $26.5 million. However, actual purchases of emissions allowances in 1992 were reported at a lower price than expected of $300 per ton.&lt;ref&gt;''Coal Voice'', Nov/Dec, 1992, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Allowances auctioned in March 1993 sold for $122 to $450 per ton,&lt;ref&gt;58 ''Federal Register'' 27563-27567, May 10, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; reducing the windfall from these allowances to $4.4 to $16.2 million. In the interim, owners of one unit retired in 1985, the 119 MWe Des Moines Energy Center, received $93 million in DOE funding for a Clean Coal Technology project to repower with a coal-fired 70 MWe pressurized fluidized-bed combustion unit,&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt; bringing it back into production in 1996.

===Location of generating units===

Excluding those 11 units, 250 active coal-fired units at 105 plants in 21 states were subject to Phase I sulfur dioxide emissions reductions in 1995. States having the greatest number of generating units affected by the Phase I requirements were:  Ohio (40), Indiana (37), Pennsylvania (21), Georgia (19), Tennessee (19), Kentucky (17), Illinois (17), Missouri (16) and West Virginia (14). Together, Phase I units represented 20% of the 1,250 operable coal-fired generating units in the U.S. in 1990.

These 250 units had a summer peak generating capability of 79,162 MWe in 1990, with a mean of 317 MWe/unit. This capacity represented about 27% of installed summer coal-fired capability, and about 11.5% of total U.S. installed summer generating capability in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Calculated from U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration. (1991). ''Annual Outlook for U.S. Electric Power 1991''. Washington, DC:  USGPO.&lt;/ref&gt; About 207 million tons, almost 90% of the coal purchased by Phase I plants in 1990, produced sulfur dioxide emissions exceeding the 1995 emissions rate of 2.5&amp;nbsp;lbs/mm Btu using no pollution control equipment.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;

===Age matters===

Age of the 250 Phase I coal units ranged from 17 to 46 years when the standards took effect, with a mean of 34 years. In 1995, 111 active Phase I units (23%) were 35 years of age or older, and only 8 (6%) were less than 20 years old. The average age of 35 coal-fired units retired during 1988-1991 was 44.6 years, with a range of 14–74 years.&lt;ref&gt;Calculated from U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration. (1991). ''Annual Outlook for U.S. Electric Power 1991''. Washington, DC:  USGPO; U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration. 1992. ''Inventory of Power Plants in the United States, 1991''. Washington, DC: USGPO.&lt;/ref&gt; These units ranged in size from 1-107 MWe summer capability. Several had been on standby (e.g., available for use during regularly scheduled outages of other units for maintenance) for many years prior to retirement. About half (often the older units) were designed to "cofire" with natural gas or fuel oil, and could be operated using these fuels instead of coal if desired.

Both the number and average age of coal-fired units retired increased substantially from 1988 to 1991, indicating utilities were removing very old units from available status that they no longer expected to use,  thereby avoiding maintenance costs necessary to keep them on standby. For comparison, the 6 Phase I coal units retired before 1990 ranged in age from 21–35 years when taken out of service, with a mean of 31 years.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;

Age of these units was significant for several reasons. All of the Phase I units were either built or under construction when the Clean Air Act of 1977 was enacted, and all but eight were built or under construction when the 1970 Act was enacted. Consequently, these units were built when labor costs were significantly less than in the 1990s, and they avoided major investments in pollution control equipment. In the 1990s, these units were often among the least expensive of any operated by their respective owners, in terms of cost per megawatt-hour of energy produced. Compared to other plants on a utility company system, these units provided incentives for their owners to maximize operating time, minimize downtime for repairs or retrofit, and minimize further capital investments in them.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;

Because capital in such plants is typically amortized over 20–30 years, investments in most of them were fully recovered by 1995. Justifying large additional capital investments in plants which may have a remaining useful life of 10 years or less, absent reconstruction of boilers, is often difficult. Further, because large coal-fired generating units tend to reach peak operating and combustion efficiencies during the first three years of operation, declining incrementally thereafter throughout their lifetimes, these old plants were among the dirtiest sources of air pollution in the electric utility industry.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt; They were able to operate for many years without substantially reducing emissions, when other plants were required to install "best available" air pollution control equipment pursuant to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977.

===Uncertainties===

Substantial uncertainties confronted electric utilities when planning compliance strategies. These included the future price and availability of fuels; the value of emissions allowances and operation of markets for them; the manner in which state [[public utilities commission]]s and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] would allocate the costs of scrubbing or switching fuels and the value of emissions allowances; accounting guidelines, revisions to interstate bulk power sales contracts, and possible intervention by the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] in interstate transfers of emissions allowances by multi-state [[holding company|holding companies]]. Changes in the competitiveness of various generating and pollution control technologies; a myriad of new rule making actions required by the Clean Air Act; and the possibility of new legislation limiting emissions of carbon dioxide, imposing a tax on carbon emissions, or on Btu usage were also of great concern.&lt;ref&gt;Platt, J.B. (1991). "Scrub Versus Trade:  Enemies or Allies?"  Presented to the EPRI-EPA-DOE Sulfur Dioxide Control Symposium, Washington, DC, December 3; Kinsman, John D., James E. Evans and Julie H. Clendenin. (1992). "Electric Utility Strategies for Controlling SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under Title IV (Acid Deposition Control) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments."  Paper presented at the 85th Annual Meeting of the Air and Waste Management Association, Kansas City, MO, June 21–26.&lt;/ref&gt; A final rule easing some uncertainty on continuous emissions monitoring, permit requirements, and operation of the emissions allowance system was not issued until January 1993,&lt;ref&gt;58 ''Federal Register'' 3590-3766, January 11, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; well after compliance strategies had to be developed and major investment decisions made.

In this context, utility executives were required to make investment decisions committing millions of dollars over extended periods. As summarized by one utility manager:  "Major decisions must be made without adequate information or even the ability to obtain adequate information."&lt;ref&gt;Platt, J.B. (1991). "Scrub Versus Trade:  Enemies or Allies?"  Presented to the EPRI-EPA-DOE Sulfur Dioxide Control Symposium, Washington, DC, December 3.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after a protracted struggle involving the [[Public Utilities Commission of Ohio|Ohio Public Utilities Commission]], the Ohio Office of Consumer's Counsel, industrial customers, the Ohio [[Sierra Club]], and the [[United Mine Workers]] at [[American Electric Power|American Electric Power Company]]'s affiliate Meigs high-sulfur coal mines,  construction of scrubbers by AEP at its two-unit, 2,600 MWe [[Gavin Power Plant|Gavin plant]] in Ohio were expected to cost about $835 million, reducing sulfur dioxide emissions there by 95%.&lt;ref&gt;''Coal Voice'', November/December 1992, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1993, AEP was still unsure whether it would be allowed by the Ohio Public Utilities Commission to transfer emissions credits from the Gavin scrub to Phase I units in other states.&lt;ref&gt;''Coal Outlook'', February 1, 1993, Supp. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, substantial financial commitments had to be made on the basis of best judgments by utility planners and construction begun in the absence of definitive information or final regulatory approvals.

===Innovations in coal supply contracts===

The risks associated with such uncertainty stimulated innovation in contracts for purchase of coal by electric utilities. In a buyer's market, utilities renegotiated old contracts and signed new ones with a variety of provisions designed to manage risks and increase flexibility for future decisions. For example, [[FirstEnergy#Ohio Edison|Ohio Edison]] signed "high/low" contracts at the end of 1991 with three coal suppliers. Under these agreements, the utility could elect to shift purchases from high-sulfur to low-sulfur coal produced by the same supplier. The supplier retained the option of continuing to ship high-sulfur coal in lieu of low-sulfur coal if it provided sufficient emissions allowances so this coal could be burned without penalty. In this event, the supplier paid for the allowances, and the utility paid the contract price for lower sulfur coal.&lt;ref&gt;''Coal Outlook'', December 9, 1991, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional innovative contract terms under consideration would link price premiums and penalties paid for coal with different levels of sulfur content to changes in the market price of sulfur dioxide emissions allowances; trade emissions allowances to coal suppliers as partial payment for low-sulfur coal; or establish larger variances in quantity and prices for different qualities of coal in a single contract.&lt;ref&gt;''Coal Outlook'', January 13, 1992, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; AMAX Energy purchased an undisclosed number of emissions allowances from [[Long Island Lighting Company]], which it said it would offer in packages with its coal and natural gas contracts.&lt;ref&gt;''Coal Outlook'', March 29, 1993, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, coal suppliers began participating along with electric utilities as buyers and sellers of marketable sulfur dioxide emissions allowances.

==Market prices==

The U.S. Department of Energy in 1991 estimated the installed retrofit cost per ton of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pollution control equipment (scrubbers) on existing units would be in the $665– $736/ton range.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy. 1991. ''Annual Outlook for U.S. Electric Power 1991''.  Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; However, 2005 was the first year the price of an SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allowance reached this level. In December 2005, a few trades were registered at slightly over $1,600/ton.&lt;ref&gt;Butraw, Dallas, and Sarah Jo Szambelan. 2009. ''U.S. Emissions Trading Markets for SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''. Washington, DC: Resources for the Future, 10.  http://www.rff.org/documents/RFF-DP-09-40.pdf (accessed September 11, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; At those rates, it was less expensive to install scrubbers and reduce air pollution than to purchase SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions allowances and continue polluting. Subsequently, the market price of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allowances decreased to around $88/ton in August 2009.

==Participation by citizen groups==

Citizens and groups can purchase sulfur dioxide emissions allowances alongside electric utilities and other producers of air pollution in annual auctions conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and on the Chicago Board of Trade.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. EPA, Buying Allowances, http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/trading/buying.html#1&lt;/ref&gt; Each year the U.S. EPA auctions off to the highest bidder about 250,000 pollution allowances that enable their owners to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide.

No national environmental group has ever bid in the annual EPA Auction, but a small number of local groups have participated for many years, apparently on the theory that reducing the supply of allowances may someday drive up the price of acquiring them. For example, one of the oldest of these groups is the [[Acid Rain Retirement Fund]] (A.R.R.F.), a non-profit, all-volunteer, community educational group. A.R.R.F. has raised money and bid alongside polluters since 1995 for as many allowances as their funds can buy. But instead of using or trading them, A.R.R.F. retires them permanently, taking allowances off the market and keeping sulfur dioxide out of the air.&lt;ref&gt;Acid Rain Retirement Fund, http://www.AcidRainRetirementFund.org/arrf.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131152111/http://www.acidrainretirementfund.org/arrf.htm |date=2012-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with allowances purchased in prior years, A.R.R.F. in 2013 owns the right to emit 2,826,000 pounds (1,413 tons) of sulfur dioxide per year, plus whatever amount it did not emit under allowances purchased in previous years. Because it did not exercise its right to emit any pollution during 1996–2013, "banking" its emissions allowances for the future, A.R.R.F. holds the legal right to emit a total of 4,644,000 pounds—or 2,322 tons—of sulfur dioxide in 2013. That amount will increase by another 100 tons in 2018, when allowances A.R.R.F. purchased in the 7-year advance auction of 2011 are eligible for use.&lt;ref name="ARRF Homepage"&gt;Acid Rain Retirement Fund, http://www.AcidRainRetirementFund.org/anew.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829171905/http://acidrainretirementfund.org/anew.htm |date=2013-08-29 }}, press release, April 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examination of EPA Auction results 1993–2013 indicates groups or individuals like A.R.R.F. who purchased emissions allowances for purposes other than releasing air pollution now own the right to emit 3,188 tons per year.&lt;ref name="ARRF Homepage"/&gt;  Although most have purchased only one or a few tons, this adds up to considerably more than the 760 tons/year allocated by law to the Miami Fort #5 coal-fired generating unit in Ohio.&lt;ref name="42 U.S. Code 7651c"&gt;42 U.S. Code 7651c.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since many purchases were made in earlier years, and unused allowances have accumulated, these groups own the right to emit 23,012 tons of sulfur dioxide in 2013.  That's more than the annual allocation of allowances to 168 of the 250 dirtiest generating units in the United States (some are allowed to emit almost 95,000 tons/year).&lt;ref name="42 U.S. Code 7651c"/&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
Overall, the Program's [[Emissions trading|cap and trade program]] has been hailed as successful by the EPA, industry, economists and certain environmental groups such as the [[Environmental Defense Fund]], while skeptical environmentalists have argued that reduction in emissions occurred due to broad trends unconnected to the program.&lt;ref&gt;Easton TA, editor. (2006). ''Taking Sides: Clashing Views on Controversial Environmental Issues'' (11th edition), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA has used what is called the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) to estimate the effect of the Acid Rain Program (ARP). The output from the model says that annual emissions of sulfur dioxide were reduced by 8 million tons (from 17.3 to 9.3), nitrogen oxides by 2.7 million tons (from 7.6 to 5), and mercury by 10 tons (from 52 to 42). However, it is difficult to estimate the emissions which would have occurred without the ARP. For example, the EPA updated its analysis to reflect the effect of low-sulfur coal becoming more economical due to reduced transportation, leading the EPA to reduce its estimate of the impact of ARP by sulfur dioxide emissions by one million tons.&lt;ref&gt;LG Chestnut, DM Mills. (2005). [http://www.appstate.edu/~whiteheadjc/eco3620/pdf/JEMacidrainprogram.pdf A fresh look at the benefits and costs of the US acid rain program]. ''Journal of Environmental Management''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions have dropped 40%, and according to the [[Pacific Research Institute]], acid rain levels have dropped 65% since 1976.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/03/MNMMTJUS1.DTL&amp;hw=Cap+trade+Acid+Rain&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 'Cap-and-trade' model eyed for cutting greenhouse gases], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], December 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2facts.com/RecordUrl.asp?article=/icof/search/i0702840.asp Facts On File News Services Databases]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although it reduced emissions by 40%, the US Acid Rain Program has not reduced SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions as much as the conventional regulation applied in the [[European Union]] (EU), which reduced SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by more than 70%.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/archives/cafe/activities/pdf/case_study1.pdf Comparison of the EU and US approaches towards Acification].&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the effectiveness of the emissions trading element as a mechanism has been criticised, since the EPA also used regulations to achieve the reductions, as all areas of the country "had to meet national, health-based, air quality standards that are separate from the Acid Rain Program’s requirements".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/progsregs/arp/docs/clearingtheair.pdf Clearing the Air: The Facts about Capping and Trading Emissions].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, total SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions were 8.9 million tons, achieving the program's long-term goal ahead of the 2010 statutory deadline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progress/arp07.html Acid Rain Program 2007 Progress Report], [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions dropped even lower—to 7.6 million tons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progress/ARP_1_graphics/SO2-Emissions-from-Acid-Rain-Program-Sources.gif]&lt;/ref&gt; which was considerably lower than of command-and-control regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Carlson|title=Sulfur Dioxide Control by Electric Utilities: What Are the Gains from Trade?|journal=The Journal of Political Economy|date=April 2000|volume=108|issue=6|url=http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-DP-98-44-REV.pdf|accessdate=26 Oct 2014|doi=10.1086/317681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA estimates that by 2010, the overall costs of complying with the program for businesses and consumers will be $1 billion to $2 billion a year, only one fourth of what was originally predicted.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"/&gt;

A general issue with cap and trade programs has been overallocation, whereby the cap is high enough that sources of emissions do not need to reduce their emissions. ARP had "early overallocation" during Phase I, and this allowed emission sources to "bank" their allowances for future years. In Phase II, emission sources drew down their banked allowances. In 2006, emissions were again below the cap, leading to further banking.&lt;ref&gt;McAllister LK. (2009).

'''Applied engineering''' is the field concerned with the application of management, design, and technical skills for the design and integration of systems, the execution of new [[product design]]s, the improvement of manufacturing processes, and the management and direction of physical and/or technical functions of a firm or organization. Applied-engineering degreed programs typically include instruction in basic engineering principles, [[project management]], industrial processes, production and operations management, systems integration and control, quality control, and statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://atmae.site-ym.com/?page=AboutATMAE ATMAE Venn Diagram]&lt;/ref&gt;

On completion of an applied engineering program, students will demonstrate the following management competencies that clearly distinguish them from traditional engineering graduates:

• Use appropriate statistical techniques in variable and attribute [[control chart]]s and in sampling tables for continuous improvement.

• Evaluate and/or implement total quality systems in industry.

• Perform [[production scheduling]], develop and monitor an [[inventory control]] system, utilize appropriate [[production planning]] techniques, and identify and exhibit key factors in project management.

• Exhibit knowledge of federal and state safety legislation and identify the role of management in an [[industrial safety]] program.

• Recognize, evaluate and control varied industrial [[health and safety]] hazards.

• Demonstrate knowledge of traditional management functions and practices, including applications and limitations of various management schemes.

• Solve problems in typical industrial organizations, work effectively in teams, and demonstrate knowledge of the managed area of an industrial enterprise.

• Apply business, marketing and economic principles to solve problems.

• Identify responsibility of supervision and management within various industries.

• Demonstrate communication skills, safe and efficient individual and group work habits, leadership within groups and an attitude of cooperation and tolerance.

Applied engineering students specialize with a technical area of study and blend hands-on process experience with theory. Examples of these technical specialties include: [[automation]]/[[robotics]], aviation, computer aided drafting &amp; design, electro-mechanical, [[electronics]], construction, graphic communications, manufacturing, [[nanofabrication]].

Applied engineers are employed in a large and wide-array of industries including: manufacturing, construction, transportation, healthcare, printing/publishing and distribution. They are responsible for implementing a design or process improvement. Although a degree in applied engineering is not considered a traditional [[design engineering]] degree (those eligible to sit for the Professional Engineering Examination), it is quite common for employers to hire applied engineering and technology graduates with the term "engineer" in their job titles. Examples of the use of Applied Engineering titles include: applications engineers, control engineers, manufacturing engineers, process engineers, product engineers, safety engineers, and sales engineers.

Graduates of applied engineering programs are frequently found in management positions due to their coursework, training and experience in [[Mathematics]], economics, statistics, [[financial accounting]], [[operations management]], [[quality management]], industrial safety, and supervision. Common management-related titles may also include: engineering managers, team leaders, plant managers, project managers, supervisors, technical managers.

Applied engineers are prepared to take an engineering design and see it through implementation and execution. They wear many hats in industry, commanding the necessary resources and personnel to contribute to an organization's bottom line.

== Accreditation and certification ==

The [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering]] (ATMAE), accredits selected collegiate programs in applied engineering. An instructor or graduate of an applied engineering program may choose to become a certified technology manager (CTM) by sitting for a rigorous exam administered by ATMAE covering [[production planning and control]], safety, quality, and management/supervision.

ATMAE program accreditation is recognized by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA) for accrediting Applied Engineering programs. CHEA recognizes ATMAE in the US for accrediting associate, baccalaureate, and master's degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology, and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in the United States.(2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf ATMAE Scope of Recognition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231001220/http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf |date=31 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC)''' is an organization comprising universities located in North America that offer graduate programs in the field of art [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]]. Each association member's primary mission is to provide education and training in conservation through the awarding of an accredited degree. Since 1974, the conservation graduate programs have held an annual meeting at one of the member programs in order to give current students the opportunity to present current research to their peers.

==History==
[[File:Corning Museum of Glass.jpg|thumb|left|The Corning Museum of Glass, site of the first conference held by the North American graduate programs in conservation]]The first conference of North American graduate programs in the conservation of art and other cultural property was held in 1974 at the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] in response to a flood that damaged the museum's artifact and library collection on June 23, 1972. While only three percent of the museum's glass collection sustained damage, over half of the museum's library holdings were lost or severely devastated.&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC book"&gt;{{cite book|author=Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC)|title=North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property, Histories &amp; Alumni|date=2000|publisher=ANAGPIC|location=Buffalo, NY|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/anagpic/histalum_full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This five-day conference entitled, "Conservation Seminar on Glass and Library Materials," was organized by Dr. [[Robert H. Brill]], the Corning Museum's research scientist. For the first time, this conference brought together students, faculty, conservators, curators, and other museum specialists for several days of lectures and discussions on the field of conservation. Five American programs and a contingent from the Canadian Conservation Institute were in attendance; [[State University of New York at Oneonta|Cooperstown Graduate Program]], [[Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library|Winterthur]]/[[University of Delaware]], [[Intermuseum Conservation Association]], [[New York University]], [[Canadian Conservation Institute]], and the [[Fogg Art Museum]]. Since the Corning Museum conference, annual meetings have become an integral part of ANAGPIC as a way to provide insight into the quality of the education provided by each program represented. Notable conservation professionals also present lectures during the conferences that address a specific area of interest in conservation, such as "Extreme Conservation" at the 2014 ANAGPIC conference. These lectures provide students with powerful insight on important issues for their future careers.&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC book"/&gt;

The Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC) was founded in May, 1984 by the following organizations: Buffalo State College, State University of New York, Art Conservation Department; Harvard University Art Museums, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies; New York University, Conservation Center, Institute of Fine Arts; Queen’s University, Art Conservation Program; Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation; The University of Texas at Austin, School of Information, Kilgarlin Center for Preservation of the Cultural Record.&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws"&gt;{{cite web|author=Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC)|title=ANAGPIC Bylaws|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/anagpic/bylaws.htm|publisher=Conservation OnLine (CoOL)|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

The general purpose of the Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC) is to “help serve the need of the conservation field for well-trained professional conservators by aiding its member training programs to attain their educational objectives.”&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws"/&gt;

In order for organizations to be eligible for membership, they must have provided conservation training for at least three consecutive years, and they must award a diploma, degree, or certificate formally acknowledged by their parent academic association. Within that parent institution, the member organization must be a distinct program, whose primary mission is conservation education and training. The program's curriculum must have substantial components of problem-solving in conservation and conservation science, and should conform to the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice. The student to faculty ratio must also be no greater than ten students per faculty member, and these faculty members must have professional qualifications to teach conservation at a graduate level. This can be demonstrated through substantial professional recognition through the [[International Institute for Conservation]] of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC), the [[American Institute for Conservation]] of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), or the Canadian Association of Professional Conservators (CAPC).&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws"/&gt;

At least one meeting of the ANAGPIC is held annually, normally concurrent with the annual Conference of the Conservation Training Programs, at present held in late spring. Typically, each institution is represented by two student presenters. Other meetings can be called as necessary if agreed to by at least two-thirds of the membership. Each member organization is normally represented by the training program director/chairperson.&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws"/&gt;

===Buffalo State College, SUNY, Art Conservation Department===
[[File:Rockwell hall.JPG|thumb|right|Rockwell Hall at Buffalo State College, where graduate courses in art conservation are held.]] Buffalo State College's Art Conservation Department was founded in 1970 as the Cooperstown Graduate Program in the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, affiliated with the State University of New York College at Oneonta and with the New York State Historical Association in Cooperstown. In 1983, the program transferred to Buffalo State College, and then relocated to its campus in 1987. Since its founding, Buffalo State offers a master of arts degree and certificate of advanced study in art conservation upon the completion of a three-year graduate program which trains conservators of fine art and material cultural heritage. This program accepts only 10 students per academic year. [[Buffalo State College|Buffalo State]] is the largest four-year college of arts and sciences in the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History - Art Conservation - Buffalo State |url=http://artconservation.buffalostate.edu/history |publisher=Buffalo State College |accessdate=21 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430053003/http://artconservation.buffalostate.edu/history |archivedate=30 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buffalo State's campus also hosts the [[Burchfield Penney Art Center]] and located across the street from the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]].

===Harvard University Art Museums, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies===

&lt;big&gt;'''Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;

The Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies provides analysis and treatments for the [[Harvard Art Museums]]’ collection, consisting of more than 250,000 objects in all media, ranging in date from [[classic antiquity|antiquity]] to the present. The Department of Technical Studies became the first institution in the United States to use scientific methods to study artists’ materials and techniques when it was founded in 1928 by Edward W. Forbes, director of Harvard University’s [[Fogg Museum]]. In 1994, the center was renamed the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies in honor of Philip A. and Lynn Straus, who were longtime benefactors of the Harvard Art Museums. In 1972, with the support from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the Straus Center began their Advanced-Level Training Program which provides formal hands-on training in the conservation of works on paper, paintings, and objects and sculpture, as well as in conservation science. They offer three 10-month fellowships each year in which fellows can refine their practical and analytical skills through the examination and treatment of works of art from the Harvard Art Museums' collections. Fellows also have the chance to publish their original research.&lt;ref name=Straus&gt;{{cite web|title=Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies|url=http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/study-research/straus|publisher=Harvard Art Museums|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York University, Conservation Center, Institute of Fine Arts===

The Conservation Center of the [[Institute of Fine Arts]] at [[New York University]] (NYU) was founded in 1960 with support from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. Since that time, the program has called for equal measures of art historical study, scientific training, and practical conservation experience. The goal was to produce a professional who would approach each object as an individual entity. The solution to an object's condition issues would be determined through research and study, unlike the tradesman restorer’s approach, which applied standard treatments to objects and problems.&lt;ref name="NYU History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Center|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/conservation/history.htm|publisher=Institute of Fine Arts, New York University|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other conservation graduate programs, NYU awards a four-year, dual-degree graduate program where students earn both their Master’s in art history and Advanced Certificate in conservation. The Conservation Center is also the oldest degree-granting conservation program in North America.

&lt;big&gt;'''Program Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''Art History, M.A. with Advanced Certificate in Conservation'''

*''First Year'' - Students gain an understanding of materials and technology, with a heavy emphasis on direct observation. No treatment is carried out during the first year, apart from simple treatment methodologies carried out in ''Principles of Conservation''. Students must also successfully pass a language translation exam within their first year of study, in the language of their choosing - French, German or Italian.
*''Second Year'' - Students complete core classes and begin training in their specialized area of study at the Conservation Center, as well as museums and private laboratories in NYC. Students also have the ability to pursue independent research projects in areas of particular interest to them.
*''Third Year'' - Students continue upper-level conservation treatment coursework in their area of concentration and complete any remaining requirements for the MA degree in art history, including the completion of the Master’s Thesis.
*''Fourth Year'' - Students complete a nine-month internship in their area of specialization at an established conservation institution. Students can complete this internship in the United States or abroad.

==History and Founding Principles==

AIB began as a management consulting firm before transitioning to offer higher education in Australia and around the world. Formerly known as the Gibaran Learning Group, the Australian Institute of Business amalgamated its institutes, including the Gibaran Graduate School of Business, the Australian Institute of Business Administration, the Tourism Institute of Australia, and the Entrepreneurship Institute Australia, into one educational organisation in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in-business.com.au/magazine/issue-61/Gibaran+rebrand+to+AIB+states+practical+principle/3171 InBusiness - Gibaran to re-brand to AIB]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222050436/http://www.in-business.com.au/magazine/issue-61/Gibaran%2Brebrand%2Bto%2BAIB%2Bstates%2Bpractical%2Bprinciple/3171 |date=February 22, 2014 }}, In Business Issue No. 61 - October/November 2011, Retrieved April 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programmes==

===Master of Business Administration (MBA)===
The Agile MBA is Australia’s largest and most progressive MBA, which has been specifically designed with the career-driven working adult in mind. Studying one subject at a time allows students to delve deep into the subject theory and apply the learnings in the workplace. This provides immediate benefit to the student and their employer from the time they start studying.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aib.edu.au/study/agile-mba/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Master of Management (MMgt)===
The Master of Management (MMgt) programme at AIB offers a degree, primarily suited to working managers, that combines Master’s-level coursework with an in-depth research project. MMgt students often undertake their research project in a subject area related to their current industry or work projects. The programme can be completed in 18 months, but may take up to three years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aib.edu.au/study-in-adelaide/master-of-management.html Master of Management - Australian Institute of Business] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626024859/http://aib.edu.au/study-in-adelaide/master-of-management.html# |date=2014-06-26 }}, Retrieved May 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctor of Business Administration (DBA)===
The Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) is a research degree designed for experienced managers. It offers an opportunity to take business and management knowledge and understanding to a higher level and, importantly, to relate it closely to the workplace needs. Like the PhD, the DBA offers a doctoral qualification but, in this case, one that is more directly linked to the world of work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aib.edu.au/study-in-adelaide/dba.html Doctor of Business Administration - Australian Institute of Business] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626063526/http://www.aib.edu.au/study-in-adelaide/dba.html# |date=2014-06-26 }}, Retrieved May 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctor of Philosophy in Management (PhD)===
The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) is the traditional doctoral qualification that is associated with a wide range of subjects in universities across the world. It offers an opportunity for research to be undertaken in depth and for the outcome to be assessed as a contribution to knowledge. Although it has a theoretical dimension, the research programme at AIB can also enable managers to explore specialist areas of practical application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aib.edu.au/study-in-adelaide/phd.html PhD (Doctor of Philosophy)- Australian Institute of Business] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626042452/http://aib.edu.au/study-in-adelaide/phd.html# |date=2014-06-26 }}, Retrieved May 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Brooklyn Waldorf School moved into its new home at the [https://brooklynwaldorf.org/about/ Claver Castle]. The School uses a tiered financial aid [[Tuition payments|tuition]] model to help achieve diversity of students.

The Brooklyn Waldorf School is a “developing status” member of the [http://awsna.org/ Association of Waldorf Schools of North America] (AWSNA).&lt;ref name=awsna&gt;[http://www.members.awsna.org/Public/SchoolListPage.aspx AWSNA Member School List]. Accessed 2008-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13197">The '''Standardized Testing and Reporting''' ('''STAR''') Program measures performance of students undergoing primary and secondary [[education in California]]. It was replaced in late 2013-early 2014 with the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP), also known as the Measurement of Academic Performance and Progress (MAPP).

==Components==
The 2012 STAR Program included four components:&lt;ref name=about2012&gt;{{cite web|title=About STAR: Program Background - 2012 STAR Test Results|publisher=[[California Department of Education]]|accessdate=30 April 2014|url=http://star.cde.ca.gov/star2012/aboutSTAR_programbg.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* California Standards Tests (CSTs)
* California Modified Assessment (CMA)
* California Alternate Performance Assessment (CAPA)
* Standards-based Tests in Spanish (STS)

The CSTs show how well students are doing in relation to the state content standards.&lt;ref name=travis&gt;{{cite web|title=CAT-6 and CST|publisher=[[Travis Unified School District]]|accessdate=30 April 2014|url=http://content.travisusd.k12.ca.us/cm/Accountability/CST%20and%20CAT-6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMA is an alternate assessment of the California content standards based on modified achievement standards for children with an individualized education program (IEP) who meet the eligibility criteria adopted by the State Board of Education.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt; Spanish-speaking English learners who are receiving instruction in Spanish are required to take the STS, as are Spanish-speaking English learners who had been enrolled in school in the United States less than 12 months when testing began; school districts have the option of administering the STS to Spanish-speaking English learners who had been enrolled in school in the United States 12 months or more who were not receiving instruction in Spanish.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt; The CAPA is an individually administered assessment for students with significant cognitive disabilities whose disabilities preclude them from taking the CSTs and CAT/6 Survey even with modifications.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt;

==Operation==
Each spring, California students in grades 2 through 11 must take a series of tests that comprise the state's STAR program. These must be completed 10 days before or after 85% of a school's year has passed.
The California Standards Tests (CSTs) are designed to match the state's academic content standards for each grade. Grades 2 through 8 tests cover mathematics and English/language arts (which includes writing in grades 4 and 7). Grades 9 through 11 cover English/language arts, mathematics, and science. History-social science tests are added for grades 8, 10 and 11 as well as science for grades 5 and 8. Except for writing, all questions are [[multiple-choice]].

==Related tests==
The California Achievement Test, Sixth Edition (CAT/6), shows how well students are doing compared to students nationally in reading, language, spelling, and mathematics in grades 3 and 7 only.&lt;ref name=travis/&gt;

California's school accountability system was originally based solely on scores from the [[TerraNova (test)|CAT/6]]. Through the [[Academic Performance Index]] (API), the scores drove the allocation of millions of dollars in intervention and award programs, depending on the health of the state’s budget. (The state has not funded award or intervention programs based on 2002 or 2003 test scores.)

APIs now include results primarily from the California Standards Tests plus CAT/6. Results from the California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE), taken by 10th graders in the 2001-02 school year, are part of high school APIs. English/language arts scores count for 10% and math for 5%.

The [[Golden State Exams]] provide an opportunity for graduating students to earn a distinction of merit on their high school diploma. To save testing time, these examinations will be combined with the high school California Standards Tests.

==History==
===Background===
The STAR Program is the cornerstone of the California Public Schools Accountability Act of 1999 (PSAA). The primary objective of the PSAA is to help schools improve the academic achievement of all students.

For three decades{{when|date=May 2014}} California students took the same statewide test, called [[California Assessment Program|CAP]] (California Assessment Program). Many districts required additional tests, such as CTBS (California Test of Basic Skills).{{when|date=May 2014}} In 1990, CAP was replaced by CLAS (California Learning Assessment System), which was discontinued in 1994 because of controversy over portions of the test. Each school district continued to use their own tests known as the High School Competency Exams which had been established as a high school graduation requirement pursuant to California law in 1978. Although not statewide tests, the High School Competency Exams had to conform to state prescribed rules of content and reporting.  These tests filled school accountability requirements until the STAR (Standardized Testing and Reporting) program began in 1998. In this program almost all students in grades 2 through 11 take the California Standards Test that reflect the state's academic content standards plus a nationally normed, standardized test every year. Each school must report individual students' scores to their parents, and group results are released in mid-August.

===Development===
The legislature reauthorized the STAR Program during 2002, and the SBE selected the California Achievement Tests, Sixth Edition Survey (CAT/6 Survey) to replace the Stanford 9 as the national norm-referenced test for the STAR Program beginning with the spring 2003 test administration.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt; The SBE also authorized the development of the California Alternate Performance Assessment (CAPA), an individually administered assessment for students with significant cognitive disabilities whose disabilities preclude them from taking the CSTs and CAT/6 Survey even with modifications.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt; The CAPA assesses the California ELA, mathematics, and science content standards that were identified as appropriate for students with significant cognitive disabilities.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt; The CAPA was first administered during spring 2003.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt;

In August 2004, the Governor signed legislation reauthorizing the STAR Program through 2011.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt; The reauthorized program reduced the CAT/6 Survey to grades three and seven.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt;

During 2005, the SBE designated the Aprenda: La prueba de logros en español, Tercera edición (Aprenda 3) to replace the SABE/2 as the designated primary language test (DPLT) for the STAR Program.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt; The Standards-based Tests in Spanish (STS) were developed to replace the DPLT and are required for the same population of students who took the DPLT.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt; Those tests were first administered in the spring of 2007 to students in grades two through four, and beginning in 2009, the STS was available for students in grades two through eleven.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt; Students taking the STS are also required to take the CSTs and/or the California Modified Assessment (CMA).&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt;

In April 2007, the U.S. Department of Education enacted regulations for an alternate assessment based on modified achievement standards, and in response to the federal regulations the CDE has developed the California Modified Assessment (CMA), an alternate assessment of the California content standards based on modified achievement standards for children with an individualized education program (IEP) who meet the eligibility criteria adopted by the State Board of Education.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt; The CMA includes assessments for ELA, mathematics, and science.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt; Eligible students may take either the CST or the CMA in a subject area; for example, a student in grade five may take the CST for ELA and take the CMA for mathematics and science.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt; The CMA was first administered in the spring of 2008 to students in grades three through five.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt; Beginning in 2011, the CMA was available to students in grades three through eleven.&lt;ref name=about2012/&gt;

===Replacement with CAASPP===
In March 2013 it was announced that the STAR testing system was set to expire in July 2014, and California would replace STAR tests with more in-depth exams in two years in 2015.&lt;ref name=SJMercuryNews1&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrington|first=Theresa|title=California to replace STAR tests with more in-depth exams in two years|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/education/ci_22335495/tested-like-never-before-california-replace-star-tests|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California STAR testing system set to expire July 2014, new education standards and testing expected|url=http://www.turnto23.com/news/local-news/california-star-testing-system-set-to-expire-july-2014-new-education-standards-and-testing-expected|work=23ABC News|publisher=Scripps Media, Inc.|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new exams would follow the new [[Common Core State Standards]] and have requirements for in-depth essays and projects that students will complete on computers.&lt;ref name=SJMercuryNews1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mills|first=David|title=New Testing Unveiled for California Schools Would Reduce STAR Testing|url=http://culvercity.patch.com/articles/new-testing-unveiled-for-california-schools-would-reduce-star-testing-6c2e1802|work=Culver City Patch|publisher=Patch|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AB 484, introduced on September 4, 2013 in the state Legislature, would end the use of STAR tests in math and English for the school year already under way – a year earlier than planned, and introduce the Measurement of Academic Performance and Progress (MAPP) tests, a new test aligned to the National Governors Association and College Board's Common Core Initiative.&lt;ref name="mercury news fed funding" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gutierrez|first=Melody|title=Bill would cancel STAR testing in math, English this year in California's schools|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2013/09/05/5708622/bill-would-cancel-star-testing.html|accessdate=30 September 2013|newspaper=Sacramento Bee|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mosbacher|first=Jack|title=Common Core: California can't afford to forgo test data|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-common-core-testing-blowback-20130920,0,6177608.story|accessdate=30 September 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AB-484 Pupil assessments: Measurement of Academic Performance and Progress (MAPP)|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB484|work=California Legislative Information|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill ended up being overwhelmingly endorsed by the Senate and was expected to pass the assembly.&lt;ref name="mercury news fed funding"&gt;{{cite news|last=Noguchi|first=Sharon|title=California schools could lose federal funding over STAR test suspension|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/central-coast/ci_24065137/california-schools-could-lose-federal-funding-over-star|accessdate=30 September 2013|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed on September 11, 2013 and signed by the Governor on October 02, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Legislature Approves AB 484|date=September 11, 2013|publisher=California Department of Education|url=http://www.cde.ca.gov/nr/ne/yr13/yr13rel89.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MAPP was renamed as the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) in emergency regulations effective on February 3, 2014 because "a private company has informed the CDE that it believes the name MAPP may confuse members of the public with evaluation services that they offer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SBAC E-mail Update Issue 72|date=January 13, 2014|publisher=California Department of Education|url=http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/sa/sbac-update72.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=regs/&gt; The regulations are in [[California Code of Regulations]] (CCR) Title 5, Division 1, Chapter 2, Subchapter 3.75 (5 CCR § 850 ''et seq.'').&lt;ref name=regs&gt;{{cite web|title=CAASPP Regulations|publisher=California Department of Education|url=http://www.cde.ca.gov/re/lr/rr/caaspp.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[California Regulatory Notice Register]] 2014, [http://www.oal.ca.gov/res/docs/pdf/notice/05z-2014.pdf No. 5-Z] (January 31, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Caribbean Examinations Council''' ('''CXC&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;''') is an [[examination board]] in the Caribbean. It was established in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/CXC--history--book-to-raise-awareness-of-the-institution_18061716|title = CXC 'history' book to raise awareness of the institution - News|website = Jamaica Observer|access-date = 2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; under Agreement by the Participating Governments in the [[CARICOM]]. To conduct such examinations as it may think appropriate and award certificates and diplomas on the results of any such examinations so conducted. The Council is empowered to regulate the conduct of any such examinations and prescribe the qualification requirements of candidates and the fees payable by them. It is now an examining body that provides educational certifications in 16 English speaking [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Caribbean Countries and Territories and has replaced the [[General Certificate of Education]] (GCE) examinations used by [[England]] and some other members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cxc.org/about/about-cxc/|title = About CXC {{!}} Caribbean Examinations Council|website = Caribbean Examinations Council|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CXC is an institution of the [[Caribbean Community]] ([[Caricom]]), it was recognised as an Associate Institution of the Community in the 1973 treaty that created the Caribbean Community. Members of the Council are drawn from the 16 territories and the region's two universities, the [[University of Guyana]] and the [[University of the West Indies]].

== Structure of the Council ==
It currently consists of the following members:

*The [[Vice Chancellor]] of the University of the West Indies;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.caribbeannewsnow.com/topstory-Caribbean-Examinations-Council-meets-in-Belize-28648.html|title = Caribbean Examinations Council meets in Belize {{!}} Caribbean News Now|website = www.caribbeannewsnow.com|access-date = 2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The Vice Chancellor of the University of Guyana; 
*Three representatives of the University of the West Indies appointed by the Vice Chancellor of the University of the West Indies, regard being given to the geographic dispersion of the campuses; 
*One representative of the University of Guyana appointed by the Vice Chancellor of the University of Guyana; 
*Two representatives appointed by each of the Participating Governments of [[Barbados]], [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and one representative appointed by each of the other Participating Governments; 
*One representative of the teaching profession appointed by each National Committee from among its members. 
 
The Participating Territories are: [[Anguilla]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Barbados]], [[Belize]], [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]], [[Montserrat]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Turks and Caicos Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/cxc.jsp?menu=community |title=Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) |website=www.caricom.org |access-date=2016-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313203305/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/cxc.jsp?menu=community |archivedate=2016-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Council hold office for a period of three years. The Chairman (who is eligible for re-election) and Deputy Chairman are elected from among the members of Council to hold office for three years or for the unexpired term of their appointments as members of the Council. The Council organises its business on a triennial basis, using the calendar year as its operative year.

The Registrar is the [[Chief Executive of the Council]] and the Council may delegate to him any of its duties relating to the holding of examinations and the appointments of staff members other than himself or the [[Pro-Registrar]].

== Examinations ==
The Caribbean Examinations Council offers three levels of examinations and certifications:
*the Caribbean Primary Exit Association (CPEA)
*the Caribbean Secondary Education Certification (CSEC)
*the Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations (CAPE)

The CXC Associate Degree Programme was unveiled in 2005, it is a tertiary qualification based on the CAPE certification.

*Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) examinations are usually taken by students after five years of [[secondary school]], and mark the end of standard secondary education. The CSEC examinations are equivalent to the [[O-Level|Ordinary Level (O-Levels)]] examinations and are targeted towards students sixteen and older. The CSEC examinations are often called the CXC examinations as they were the only examinations offered by the CXC from 1979 until 1998.
*Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations (CAPE) examinations are taken by students who have completed their secondary education and wish to continue their studies. Students who wish to sit for the CAPE usually possess CSEC or an equivalent certification. The CAPE is equivalent to the [[Advanced Level (UK)|British Advanced Levels (A-levels)]], they are both voluntary qualifications that are intended for university entrance. Since it was introduced in 1998, the number of subjects offered at CAPE has increased.

While it may vary by territory, the CSECs are generally viewed as an employment qualification certifying the holder as a secondary school graduate. While the CAPE is considered a suitable qualification for entry into tertiary education.

The island territories of [[Saint Maarten]] and [[Saba]] - both part of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] - also conduct exams administered by the Council. In 1993, the Caribbean Examinations Council Act was commenced to secure the integrity of examinations conducted by the council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://jamaicalawonline.com/revised-laws/statutes/67-CARIBBEAN%2520EXAMINATIONS%2520COUNCIL%2520ACT.html|title = CARIBBEAN EXAMINATIONS COUNCIL ACT|website = jamaicalawonline.com|access-date = 2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://moj.gov.jm/laws/caribbean-examinations-council-act|title = Caribbean Examinations Council Act {{!}} Ministry of Justice - Government of Jamaica|website = moj.gov.jm|access-date = 2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2932">The '''Davidson Institute of Science Education''' is a public [[nonprofit organization]] aimed at promoting and nurturing the scientific, mathematical and technological education in [[Israel]]. Serving as the educational arm of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], the Davidson Institute develops, evaluates and provides a wide variety of educational programs for teaching and learning science and mathematics at all ages and levels. It is located on campus of the Weizmann Institute in [[Rehovot]].

==History==
The Davidson Institute for Science Education was established by [[Haim Harari]] (who has been the Institute's [[Chairman of the Board]] ever since) in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/davidson-institute-science-education Davidson Institute of Science Education - About the Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; following a large endowment gift from [[Bill Davidson (businessman)|William (Bill) Davidson]]  and contributions from other donors. 
[[Science education]] activities started at the Weizmann Institute in the early [[1960’s]]. Over the decades, these activities led to the creation of an academic department of Science Teaching at the Weizmann Institute and, in parallel, to an ever expanding array of educational field activities aimed at schools, teachers, students and the general public. The success and proliferation of these programs eventually required the establishment of a separate, non-profit entity with dedicated to such activities, with a strong scientific linkage to the Weizmann Institute.

==Activities==
Davidson Institute's formal programs target different target groups such as outstanding gifted students, entire school classes and their teachers, [[at-risk students|youth at risk]], underachieving youth, math and science teachers, young talented students from abroad and the general public of all ages. Extracurricular activities include afternoon science clubs, science Olympiads and competitions, public science lectures, national and international science camps, annual events, and the [[Clore Garden of Science]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israel.org/MFA/Israel%20beyond%20the%20conflict/The%20Clore%20Garden%20of%20Science%20-%20A%20Worlds%20First The Clore Garden of Science – A Worlds First&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; outdoor museum. Providing science education programs for all ages gives the Davidson Institute a holistic perspective of [[Life Long Learning]] and a special understanding of the needs of the various segments of Israeli society.
Activities are conducted in Hebrew, English, Arabic, and Spanish.
Weizmann Institute's researchers and graduate students are actively involved in all Davidson Institute's programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8764">'''Doctorandus''' ({{IPA-nl|dɔktoːˈrɑndɵs}}; {{Lang-la|he who should become a [[Doctorate|doctor]]}}), abbreviated '''drs.''', is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[List of academic ranks|academic title]] according to the pre-[[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]]–[[Master's degree|Master]] system. The female form is 'doctoranda' (abbreviated '''dra.''', though this abbreviation is no longer used). The title is acquired by passing the ''doctoraalexamen'', the [[Final examination|exam]] which usually concludes university study. Some students will continue to do research under the supervision of a [[professor]], which eventually allows them to obtain the title of [[Doctorate|doctor]].

In Dutch, the words ''doctoraal'' and ''doctoraat'' have different meanings, the first referring to the doctorandus, the second word referring to the doctorate phase or title. The word 'doctorandus' is based on the traditional principle that this degree is a prerequisite and intermediate step for obtaining a doctorate title. However, in the twentieth century the doctorandi have become considered to be graduates and when they can choose a scientific career, the do usually as a paid ''[[promovendus]]'' and not as research students. An exception are medical students, where the doctoral exam is an intermediate step after which the students have to follow internships, in order to obtain the full medical degree of physician (''arts'' in Dutch).

== Netherlands ==
According to Dutch legislation, the Dutch doctorandus degree is equivalent to the [[Master of Arts|MA]] or [[MSc]] degree in English-speaking countries, with the difference that the coursework and comprehensive exams for a doctorate are included in the academic study. After being graduated to "drs.", the candidate can start with PhD-level research and writing the dissertation without any further exams.

The abbreviation is '''drs.''' This means that Dutch graduates who received the doctorandus title may sign like '''drs. A. Jansen'''. After the [[Bologna process]], the title doctorandus has been replaced by the degrees MA and MSc, and those who receive such Dutch degrees may choose: they may use MA/MSc behind their name, or continue to use drs., mr. or ir., reflecting the field in which they graduated. According to Art. 7.20 of the Dutch law on higher education and scientific research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005682/Hoofdstuk7597869/Titel1/Paragraaf4/Artikel720/geldigheidsdatum_25-08-2011 Art. 7.20 WHW]&lt;/ref&gt; a graduate of a master's degree granted through scientific education (i.e. by a Dutch research university) may sign as ir. (ir. stems from the dutch 'ingenieur' (engineer)) for those who graduated in an academic study of agriculture, natural environment or technical field, mr. (mr. stems from the dutch 'meester' (master) at law) for those who graduated in law and drs. by those who graduated in other fields. According to Art. 7.19a&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005682/Hoofdstuk7597869/Titel1/Paragraaf4/Artikel719a/geldigheidsdatum_25-08-2011 Art. 7.19a WHW]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dutch customs the degrees granted to such graduates are MSc for engineers, MA or MSc for doctoranduses and established by ministerial regulation for jurists (actually LLM). This means that two situations can be discerned:

# Those who received their doctorandus title before the Bologna process have the option of signing like '''A. Jansen, M''', since the old doctorandus title (from before the Bologna process) is similar to a [[Master's degree]], and the shortcut M may officially be used in order to render such title as an international title.&lt;ref name=nvao&gt;[http://www.nvao.net/titulatuur_nl Titulatuur Nederland] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930061733/http://www.nvao.net/titulatuur_nl |date=September 30, 2011 }} Dutch-Flemish Accreditation Organization &amp;mdash; this source denies that one may bear a [[Bologna Process|Bologna-style]] bachelor's or master's degree instead of the old titles.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minocw.nl/bachelor/355/Titels.html Opleidingen en titels] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210184259/http://www.minocw.nl/bachelor/355/Titels.html |date=February 10, 2009 }} Dutch Department of Education, Culture and Science. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/hoger-onderwijs/titulatuur Titulatuur] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304133509/http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/hoger-onderwijs/titulatuur |date=March 4, 2012 }} website of the government of the Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=royal2002&gt;[http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/hoger-onderwijs/vraag-en-antwoord/welke-titel-mag-ik-voeren-als-ik-ben-afgestudeerd-of-gepromoveerd.html Vraag en antwoord.

# Those who received their master's degree from Dutch research universities after the Bologna process in other fields than agriculture, natural environment, technical field and law may also bear the title doctorandus and alternatively have the option of signing like '''A. Jansen, MA''' or '''A. Jansen, MSc''',&lt;ref&gt;Art. 7.19a, section 2, subsections f and g of the Dutch Law on higher education and scientific research.&lt;/ref&gt; but only as specified on their diploma. In this case, either a MA or a MSc is granted, which entitles one to bear the title doctorandus. This means that people who have graduated soon after 1 September 2002 have no (separate) bachelor's degree, but only a master's degree, which is their first degree.

== Belgium ==
In [[Belgium]] the title drs is only used for graduates working on a [[PhD]], which will then eventually change their title from Drs. to Dr. The title Lic (which stems from 'licentiaat') is used for those who have finished a masters' degree, but it is rarely used.

== Indonesia ==
The degree was also used in [[Indonesia]] until 1994 (because of Indonesia being a former colony of the Netherlands), where it was given to all bachelors except law, agriculture, natural environment, and engineering. The title ir. for academic engineers is still used in Indonesia by those who obtained their degree before 1994.

== Other ==
In Sweden and Estonia the term is used in the form: "doktorand", with the same etymology:  ''he who should become a [[Doctorate|doctor]]'' (but dropping the gender qualifier) to refer to a student reading for his or her doctorate. However, it is not a formal title and is never written abbreviated. Similarly, in Romania it is "doctorand", abbreviated "drd."

'''Ernst Rudolph Georg Eckert''' (September 13, 1904 – July 8, 2004) was a [[scientist]] who advanced the film cooling technique for aeronautical engines. He earned his Diplom Ingenieur and doctorate in 1927 and 1931, respectively, and [[Habilitation|habilitated]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Pfender E (2007) ''Ernst R. G. Eckert', in "Memorial Tributes: National Academy of Engineering", Vol. 11, 108-113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''NOTE''': Dr. Eckert was reportedly involved with the development of the [[V-1 flying bomb]] and the [[V-2]] rocket,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} but the film cooling for the throat of the V-2 rocket motor was developed by other persons at [[Peenemünde]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Eckert worked as a rocket and jet engine scientist at the Aeronautical Research Institute in [[Braunschweig]], [[Germany]], then via [[Operation Paperclip]], began jet propulsion research in 1945 at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]].   In 1951, Eckert joined the [[University of Minnesota]] in the department of [[mechanical engineering]]. Eckert published more than 550 scientific papers and books. The [[Eckert number]] in [[fluid dynamics]] was named after him.

Dr. Eckert's son-in-law Horst Henning Winter is a professor of chemical engineering at [[UMass]]. Dr. Winter specializes in rheology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17927">[[File:Alfred de Falloux Disderi BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|Alfred de Falloux, ca.1860]]
The '''Falloux Laws''' were voted in during the [[French Second Republic]] and promulgated on 15 March 1850 and in 1851, following the presidential election of [[Napoleon III of France|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]] in December 1848 and the [[French legislative election, 1849|May 1849 legislative elections]] that gave a  majority to the conservative [[Parti de l'Ordre]]. Named for the [[Minister of Education (France)|Minister of Education]] [[Alfred de Falloux]], they mainly aimed at promoting [[Catholicism in France|Catholic]] teaching. The Falloux Law of 15 March 1850 also extended the requirements of the [[Guizot Law]] of 1833, which had mandated a [[Single-sex education|boys' school]] in each [[Communes of France|commune]] of more than 500 inhabitants, to require a girls' school in those communes. The 1851 law created a mixed system, in which some [[primary education]] establishments were public and controlled by the state and others were under the supervision of [[Congregation (Catholic)|Catholic congregations]]. 

The new law opened an era of cooperation between Church and state that lasted until the [[Jules Ferry laws|Ferry laws]] ended this in the early 1880s. The Falloux laws provided universal primary schooling in France and expanded opportunities for secondary schooling. In practice, the curricula in Catholic and state schools were similar. Catholic schools were especially useful in schooling for girls, which had long been neglected.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Harrigan, "Church, State, and Education in France From the Falloux to the Ferry Laws: A Reassessment," ''Canadian Journal of History,'' (2001) 36#1 pp 51-83&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main features ==

The main objectives of the Falloux Laws was to replace the [[French Revolution|revolutionary]] and [[First French Empire|imperial]] system, which had placed the whole of the [[Education in France|education system]] under the supervision of the [[University of France|University]] and of state-trained teachers, who were accused of spreading [[Republicanism|Republicans]] and [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] ideas, by a system giving responsibility for education back to the clergy. This aim was largely achieved: the Falloux Law created a mixed system, public (and mostly secular) on one hand, and private and [[Roman Catholicism in France|Catholic]] on the other.

This law allowed the clergy and members of ecclesiastical orders, male and female, to teach without any further qualifications. This exemption was extended even to priests who taught in secondary schools, where a university degree was demanded from lay teachers. The primary schools were put under the management of the [[curé]]s. 

The Falloux Law created one academy for each [[Departments in France|department]], decentralising the University and thus strengthening the notables' local influence. It reorganised the Superior Council of Education and academic councils, specifically by giving a large number of places to representatives of various religions, above all of Roman Catholicism. Eight University members had seats at the Superior Council of Public Instruction, alongside seven religious representatives (including four Catholics), three [[Council of State (France)|state counsellors]], three members of the Institute, and three members representing "free" (i.e. private) teaching establishments. Similarly, bishops were included in the academic councils.

Primary and secondary education were divided between state establishments, and private establishments, headed by non-profit organisations or religious congregations. Supervision of schools was the joint responsibility of the mayor and the priest.

== Historical and political background ==
[[File:Alfred de Falloux.jpg|thumb|[[Alfred de Falloux]].]]
The Falloux Law was promulgated in a context in which French Catholics were worried about the increasing role of the state in education since the [[French Revolution|Revolution of 1789]] and the reorganisation of the [[University of France|imperial University]]. They thought that the imperial education system, inherited from the [[French First Empire|First Empire]]'s reforms, excessively diffused [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], [[Republicanism|republican]] and [[socialism in France|socialist]] ideas.&lt;ref name="Albertini"&gt;Pierre Albertini, ''L'École en France.'', p. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they wanted the education system to return to its basis during the [[Ancien Régime]]. 

The [[Bourbon Restoration]] had in part satisfied these wants, by tolerating teaching by religious congregations, although it still theoretically remained prohibited, and had also granted more weight to [[bishop]]s in the education system, enabling schooling programs to give more attention to Catholicism.

However, the [[July Monarchy]] was much less friendly to this [[reactionary]] trend. Although the [[Guizot Law]] of 1833 partially satisfied Catholics by authorising private teaching in primary education, it kept secondary and higher education under the University's supervision. Guizot also generalised the ''écoles normales primaires'', which were responsible for the training of teachers. First created by the [[National Convention]] in 1794, these schools, related to the ''[[écoles normales supérieures]]'', were organised on the basis of the 1808 decree organising the University of France, and were accused by conservatives of promoting Republicanism, Socialism and anti-clericalism.

== First debates during 1848-1849 ==
 
After the [[1848 Revolution in France|1848 Revolution]], [[Lazare Hippolyte Carnot]] was named Minister of Public Instruction and prepared a draft reform. He named the Republican [[Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire]] president of the parliamentary commission which would write the draft.&lt;ref name=Buisson&gt;[[James Guillaume]], [http://www.inrp.fr/edition-electronique/lodel/dictionnaire-ferdinand-buisson/document.php?id=2715 Falloux entry] in the ''Nouveau dictionnaire de pédagogie'' (dir. [[Ferdinand Buisson]]), 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter would have made education mandatory for children of both sexes, as well as a three years of training for teachers, subsided by the state. Although it favoured public schools, it still allowed private teaching establishments.&lt;ref&gt;Inès Murat, ''La IIe République'', Paris, Fayard, 1987, p.198-200&lt;/ref&gt; Carnot's draft was however set aside after his resignation on 5 July 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Inès Murat, ''La IIe République'', Paris, Fayard, 1987, p.290&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, parliamentary debates were resumed. The newly elected President [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoléon Bonaparte]] replaced Carnot with [[Alfred de Falloux]] as Minister of Public Instruction in December 1848, the latter remaining in [[Odilon Barrot]]'s government until May 1849. The [[decree]] of 11 December 1848 made the upcoming law on education an [[organic law]], which should thus be reserved to the Constituent Assembly's initiative.&lt;ref name=Buisson/&gt;

A [[Legitimists|Legitimist]] (i.e. a conservative Royalist), Falloux officially withdrew Carnot's draft bill on 4 January 1849 and dissolved the Scientific and Literary Study Commission named by Carnot. Falloux clearly aimed at restoring Roman Catholicism to the forefront of French schooling and society, describing his program in his ''Memoirs'': "God in education. The Pope at the head of the Church. The Church at the head of civilisation." 

Having dissolved Carnot's commission, Falloux created two new ministerial commissions, dedicated to preparing the draft laws for primary and secondary education, which quickly merged. Both were composed by a majority of conservative Catholics. Presided by the Minister Falloux himself, it had as vice-president [[Adolphe Thiers]],&lt;ref name=Buisson/&gt; and included Catholics such as the [[archbishop of Paris]] [[Marie-Dominique-Auguste Sibour|Mgr Sibour]], the abbot [[Félix Dupanloup|Dupanloup]] (who later became [[bishop of Orléans]]), etc. Surprisingly, Thiers, formerly a critic of the Church's involvement in education, was one of those who most supported Catholics' influence in the education system, being ready to hand over to the clergy the whole of the primary education establishments, whilst bishop Dupanloup and others strong Catholics calmed his excessive claims.&lt;ref name=Buisson/&gt;

Upset by this measure, in part because the December 1848 decree had given the initiative for the legislative process, concerning organic laws, to the Assembly, the latter nominated a new parliamentary Commission to re-establish its prerogatives following a proposition by the moderate Republican [[Pascal Duprat]].&lt;ref name=Buisson/&gt; This parallel Commission was presided by the Minister of Public Instruction [[Achille Tenaille de Vaulabelle|de Vaulabelle]] and had as secretary the Republican [[Jules Simon]].&lt;ref name=Buisson/&gt;

Parliamentary debates focused on Article 9 of the [[French Constitution of 1848|new Constitution]] concerning education.&lt;ref name=1848constitution&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/la-constitution/les-constitutions-de-la-france/constitution-de-1848-iie-republique.5106.html |title=Constitution de 1848, IIe République |website=[[Constitutional Council (France)]]|language=French |trans-title=Constitution of 1848, 2nd Republic|access-date=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic deputy [[Charles de Montalembert]] then described the University's monopoly in the education system as "intellectual communism" and claimed the system was "inferior to that of the Ancien Régime".&lt;ref&gt;''Les constitutions de la France'' présentées par [[Jacques Godechot]], p. 259-260.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 9 proclaimed that "education is free" ("''L'enseignement est [[Gratis versus libre|libre]]''")" while adding that this "freedom of education" was determined by legislation and exercised "under state supervision."&lt;ref name=1848constitution /&gt; While authorising private establishments, this article thus ensured that education in general was placed under the watch of the state. The extent of the latter would be determined by forthcoming laws.

On 5 February 1849, Jules Simon presented to the Assembly the draft law, composed of 23 articles.&lt;ref name=Buisson/&gt; However, Odilon Barrot's government claimed that the Constituent Assembly's mandate was coming to an end, and that further proposed laws would have to be examined by the succeeding National Assembly. Pressed for time, the Constituent Assembly thus decided to examine the most pressing laws. Deputy [[Nérée Boubée|Boubée]], a scientist and University lecturer, proposed that the draft education law be one of those scrutinised, but his motion was rejected by 458 votes against 307.&lt;ref name=Buisson/&gt;

== New debates following the May 1849 elections ==

Discussion of the new law would thus have to wait the [[French legislative election, 1849|May 1849 legislative election]]. But these ones gave an absolute majority to the conservative [[Parti de l'Ordre]], mainly composed of Catholic monarchists, whether [[Orleanism|Orleanists]] or Legitimists, such as Falloux who was elected deputy.&lt;ref name=Buisson/&gt;

Despite having been dissolved, the Commission presided by [[Barthélémy Saint-Hilaire]] and named by Carnot submitted its draft and report to the Assembly on 10 April 1849.&lt;ref name=Buisson/&gt; This work was ignored during further discussions.&lt;ref name=Buisson/&gt; On 18 June 1849, Falloux submitted to the Assembly the draft bill elaborated by the ministerial commission which he had himself named. Falloux thus resumed his plans: "Instruction has remained too much isolated from education; education has remained too much isolated from religion." &lt;ref name=Buisson/&gt; 

The Assembly hereby named another parliamentary commission, where Catholics had again the upper-hand. It included Salomon (from the [[Meuse]]), the Protestant theologian [[Athanase Laurent Charles Coquerel|Coquerel]], Baze, the theologian [[Armand de Melun]] (who had been a collaborator of late [[Denys Affre]], former archbishop of Paris), [[de l'Espinay]], Sauvaire-Barthélemy (a grandnephew of the [[François-Marie, marquis de Barthélemy|marquis de Barthélémy]]), Dufougeray, [[Barthélémy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Charles de Montalembert|de Montalembert]], [[Eugène Rouher|Rouher]], [[Adolphe Thiers|Thiers]], Beugnot, Fresneau, Janvier, [[Pierre Louis Parisis|Parisis]] (bishop of [[Langres]]).&lt;ref name=Buisson/&gt; The Commission chose Thiers as president and Beugnot as "''rapporteur''" (in charge of presenting the draft bill to the Assembly). Falloux also managed to bypass the [[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'Etat]]'s examination of the law, the latter being composed of several Republicans.&lt;ref name=Buisson/&gt;

In September 1849, Falloux fell sick, and was replaced in October as Minister of Public Instruction by [[Félix Esquirou de Parieu]].&lt;ref name=Buisson/&gt;  On 11 January 1850, a minor law (named Parieu Law) was passed, simplifying procedures of suspension and revocation of teachers. The draft was discussed again starting on 14 January 1850. During these debates, [[Victor Hugo]], although member of the Parti de l'Ordre, criticised the renewed influence of the clergy. The law was finally adopted on 15 March 1850, by 399 votes against 237.&lt;ref&gt;I. Murat, ''La Deuxième République'', ''op.cit.'' p. 423-424.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reforms of the Third Republic and latter posterity ==

The [[Third French Republic|Third Republic]] abrogated or reformed most dispositions of the Falloux Laws. The 27 February 1880 law reduced the clergy's representation in educational councils. The [[Ferry Laws]] established mandatory, free and [[Laïcité|laic]] education. The [[Goblet Law]] abrogated the first and second section of the Falloux Law. In 1904, among increasing voices to repeal entirely the Falloux Law, the Minister [[Emile Combes]] prohibited religious congregations from teaching, including in private schools. 

However, Catholics responded by creating "lay private schools", where religious education was maintained, although teaching was done by lay people, and not clergy.

The [[Vichy Regime]] allowed again religious congregations to teach and strongly subsided private Catholic schools. Although these subsidies were interrupted following the [[Liberation of France|Liberation]], the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF) did not repeal the teaching authorisation given to congregations. The [[Debré Law]] of 1959 went further, by having private schools' teachers paid by the state.

Although the Falloux Laws have formally been repealed since the promulgation of the Education Code in 2000, several of their dispositions have been retained in the Code, and form the main legislative framework for private schools.

== La loi Falloux après 1850 ==
=== Réformes administratives ===

Peu après le [[coup d'État du 2 décembre 1851]], un décret met fin à l'élection des membres des conseils de l'instruction, à l'exception des conseillers généraux dans les conseils académiques. Tous les autres membres sont nommés par le chef de l'État. 

La loi du 14 juin 1854 met fin au système d'une académie dans chaque département. La carte des académies est réorganisée avec 16 académies seulement. Dans chaque académie, la loi installe un [[Inspecteur d'académie]] et un [[Conseil départemental de l'éducation nationale|Conseil départemental de l'instruction publique]]. Le reste des dispositions de la loi Falloux est maintenu, y compris la compétence des conseils consultatifs. 

=== Le « retour en grâce » de l'école privée ===

[[File:Autocollant du PS pour la manifestation du 24 janvier 1994... Munhoven.JPG|240px|thumb|right|autocollant édité par la PS lors des manifestations de janvier 1994]]
==La loi Falloux aujourd'hui==

La loi Falloux est aujourd'hui formellement abrogée, toutefois, certains de ces articles ont été repris dans le [[Code de l'éducation]]. Il s'agit surtout des articles concernant l'enseignement privé, qui fixent ainsi : 
*les conditions d'ouverture des établissements privés d'enseignement ; 
*le contrôle exercé sur ces établissements ; 
*la discipline des maîtres de l'enseignement privé ; 
*la compétence contentieuse des conseils d'académie ; 
*les limites au financement des établissements privés par les [[administration territoriale|collectivités territoriales]]. 

Toutefois, les dispositions sur le contrôle administratif et sur la discipline des maîtres ne sont que partiellement applicables à l'enseignement dit « sous contrat » et ne concernent guère que l'enseignement dit « hors contrat ». --&gt;

'''Gamar Hajiaga qizi Almaszadeh''' ({{lang-az| Qəmər Hacıağa qızı Almaszadə}}) (10 March 1915, [[Baku]] – 7 April 2006, [[Baku]]) was an [[Azerbaijan]]i ballerina and ballet instructor. She's considered the first ballerina of the [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai103_folder/103_articles/103_almaszade.html My Life as Azerbaijan's First Ballerina]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gamar Almaszadeh (nicknamed Tamara) was born in [[Baku]] to a family of a shoemaker and a midwife, Hajiaga and Maryam Almaszadeh. She became interested in [[ballet]] at a very young age, when she saw her friend perform ballet moves. Persuaded by her friend she signed up for ballet lessons at a private studio (later reorganized into the Baku School of Choreography). Gamar's mother approved of her daughter's new interest but her father Hajiaga Almaszadeh, a conservative [[Muslim]], had to be misled into believing that Gamar was attending gym in order to have him pay for her lessons. The secret was soon revealed and, as expected, Gamar's father did not come around to her choice. However he was reported to have secretly assisted at his daughter's performances later, when she became a renowned ballerina.&lt;ref name="azerbintl"&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai103_folder/103_articles/103_almaszade.html Center Stage: My Life as Azerbaijan's First Ballerina] by Gamar Almaszadeh. ''Azerbaijan International''. #10.3. Autumn 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

After graduating from the choreographic school in 1930, Gamar Almaszadeh began working at the [[Azerbaijan State Opera and Ballet Theatre]]. To meet her father's expectations, she also enrolled in a teachers' college. In 1932, she left for [[Moscow]] to continue her ballet education but soon returned to Baku after being chosen to perform a secondary role in [[Reinhold Glière]]'s opera ''Shakh-Senem''.&lt;ref name="azerbintl"/&gt; In 1933, she was admitted to a professional ballet school in [[St. Petersburg]], where she had Maria Romanova-Ulanova (mother of the world-famous ballerina [[Galina Ulanova]]) as an instructor.&lt;ref&gt;{{az icon}} [http://www.musigi-dunya.az/Magazine3/articles/30/30.html The Founder of Ballet in Azerbaijan] by K.Shahverdiyev. ''Musigi-dunya.az''. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, she finished her studies and once again returned to Baku. In 1937, she founded the [[Azerbaijan State Folk Song and Dance Ensemble]] affiliated with the [[Azerbaijan State Philharmonic Society]]. Guided by composer [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]], she organized research expeditions to various parts of Azerbaijan to film and document folk dance performances and to enrich the repertoire of her ensemble as well as to propagate them on the big scene.&lt;ref name="azerbintl"/&gt; In 1939, she taught her first choreography class and in 1940, made her first biggest performance in the lead role of [[Afrasiyab Badalbeyli]]'s ''Giz Galasi'' ("The Maiden Tower").&lt;ref name="azerbintl"/&gt; She later became head of the School of Choreography (one of her students was prominent Azerbaijani ballerina [[Leyla Vakilova]]). During her career, she toured [[France]], [[India]], and [[Nepal]]. In 1970, she was invited to [[Baghdad]] by [[Iraq]]'s Ministry of Culture to promote Iraqi folk dance culture and founded the Iraq Folk Dance Ensemble.&lt;ref name="azerbintl"/&gt; She retired from ballet in the 1950s, but remained an instructor at the School of Choreography until the late 1990s.

She married Afrasiyab Badalbeyli in 1931, however the marriage did not last very long.&lt;ref name="gubek"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.baku.ru/blg-list.php?id=6278&amp;usp_id=73942&amp;cmm_id=0 Azerbaijan's First Ballerina] by Nonna de Gubek. ''Baku Pages''. 1 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
*Gamar Almaszadeh's younger sister Adila Almaszadeh also took ballet lessons and went off to St. Petersburg to study professional ballet. However the asperity of the northern climate affected Adila's health (as she was extremely sensitive to climate change) leading to her death of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="gubek"/&gt;
*In the 1930s, a religious fanatic attempted to assassinate Gamar Almaszadeh on her way out of the theatre, but the bullet hit the spike heel of her shoe leaving Gamar unharmed.&lt;ref name="gubek"/&gt;

'''GEOSET''' (Global Educational Outreach for Science Engineering and Technology) is a nonprofit educational initiative founded by the Nobel Laureate [[Sir Harold Kroto]] in 2006 to provide a “free resource of educational material”. Students record presentations detailing their work or interests on a subject matter. The presentations can also form part of course assessment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/videos/31302/the-revolutionary-impact-of-the-gooyouwiki-world-gyww-on-education-and-student-success-lecture-discussion-2010/laureate-kroto   (Time 36:39), http://www.journaloffloridastudies.org/files/JFSms1-1-10_PDF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The main GEOSET website is a database gateway that links all the contributing institutions and the local site and contains presentations produced at the [[Florida State University]] GEOSET Studios. Some of the students who have recorded presentations have been successful in obtaining job offers when showing the video to perspective employers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tallahasseemagazine.com/January-February-2010/Just-Call-Him-Harry/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Harold Kroto 1c389 8471.sweden.jpg|left|thumb|220px|GEOSET founder Sir Harold Kroto.]]

The inspiration for GEOSET was based on the ability of [[Google]], [[YouTube]] and [[Wikipedia]] to enable people across the world to access a repository of educational material. Harold Kroto called this revolution the "Goo-You-Wiki World".&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/videos/31302/the-revolutionary-impact-of-the-gooyouwiki-world-gyww-on-education-and-student-success-lecture-discussion-2010/laureate-kroto)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Participating organizations and institutions are encouraged to record presentations and create a local site to host them. The [[URL]]s from the presentations and representative images are then added to a GEOSET database site. The videos produced make up a series of concepts which teachers are encouraged to use.&lt;ref&gt;(http://archive.tallahassee.com/article/20091001/FSVIEW/90930025/Kroto-talks-science-ed-NPR )&lt;/ref&gt; There are many participating institutions including the [[University of Sussex]],&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.sussex.ac.uk/geoset)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheffield University]]&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.geokri.org/)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Toyo University]].&lt;ref&gt;(http://bionano.toyo.ac.jp/GEOSET-index.html)&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative has also been demonstrated in the [[Middle East]] with the aim of strengthening the resources for science research &lt;ref&gt;(https://www.fsu.edu/news/2005/05/25/petra.conference/)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.ameinfo.com/blog/education-&amp;-childcare/middle-east-science-fund/professor-kroto-visits-just-yarmouk-and-jordan-universities-to-introduce-geoset-initiative-in-jordan/)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.meed.com/sectors/economy/education/professor-kroto-visits-just-yarmouk-and-jordan-universities-to-introduce-geoset-initiative-in-jordan/3011446.article)&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.ebeijing.gov.cn/feature_2/Nobel_Prize_Forum_2007/VIP_Guests_2007/t919198.htm)&lt;/ref&gt; with Anhui University of Technology (AHUT) being one of the first to join the GEOSET initiative.&lt;ref&gt;(http://en.ahut.edu.cn/info/1001/1118.htm)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
[[File:Geoset recording.png|left|thumb|440px|A dual screen recording of a student giving a presentation.]]

Capture station technology provided by Mediasite is used to record presentations at Florida State University &lt;ref&gt;(http://www.sonicfoundry.com/impact-award/florida-state-university-geoset)&lt;/ref&gt; with other [[rich media]] formats such as [[Adobe Presenter]]&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.legacy.geoset.fsu.edu/swa/quiz1/index.htm)&lt;/ref&gt; and Camtasia Studios.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.legacy.geoset.fsu.edu/presentations/harry_vignettes_Don_Marquis/harry_vignettes_Don_Marquis.html)&lt;/ref&gt; However international partner organizations have used a variety of recording options.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.geokri.org/)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Florida State University GEOSET facility opened a centralized recording studio in the Paul Dirac Science Library.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.fsunews.com/article/20130917/FSVIEW/130917012/Dirac-Science-Library-reopens-after-renovations-future-upgrades-planned)&lt;/ref&gt; The studio is primarily student run with Dr. Steve Acquah and Sir Harold Kroto directing.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.worldofwebcast.com/blog/2014-06)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.asianscientist.com/features/nobel-laureate-sir-harold-kroto-buckyball-discovery-science-education-and-creativity-2012/)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/internacionales/la-iniciativa-geoset-fomenta-ensenanza-y-divulgacion-cientifica-en-a-latina/20140202/nota/2068866.aspx)&lt;/ref&gt; GEOSET is also expanding into South America with a joint technology collaboration with the [[Universitat Politècnica de València]], demonstrating [[Polimedia]] instructional technology to government representatives and universities including [[Uruguay]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.lasprovincias.es/agencias/20140202/comunitatvalenciana/comunitat/geoset-fomentan-ensenanza-divulgacion-cientifica_201402021207.html)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==

In May 2008 GEOSET received a finalist award for the [[Sonic Foundry]] Rich Media Impact Awards in the category of Global Reach.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.sonicfoundry.com/press-release/sonic-foundry-names-finalists-fourth-annual-rich-media-impact-awards)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 GEOSET won the Rich Media Impact Award in the category of Global Reach.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.sonicfoundry.com/press-release/sonic-foundry-announces-winners-fifth-annual-rich-media-impact-awards)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, GEOSET received $100,000 from [[Microsoft]] Research for science education.&lt;ref&gt;(http://artsandsciences.fsu.edu/In-the-News/Microsoft-gives-100K-to-FSU-for-science-education)&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014 GEOSET Studios won the Enterprise Video Award in the category of Educational Scholarship &lt;ref&gt;(http://www.sonicfoundry.com/press-release/sonic-foundry-announces-winners-10th-annual-enterprise-video-awards)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Gebert was born in [[Des Moines, Iowa]] in 1941 to Gordon and Violette Gebert. His father was a salesman for a trailer company, and sold truck and bus fleets for [[Ford Motor Co]] in Iowa. In 1948, Gebert, age 7 years, moved with his family to [[Van Nuys, California]]. In the 1949 Gebert was cast in the movie ''[[Holiday Affair]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brophy Champion|first1=Allison|title=Timmy from "Holiday Affair" coming to Culpeper|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/starexponent/news/timmy-from-holiday-affair-coming-to-culpeper/article_cb4b54c2-863d-11e4-8246-9351eacd735d.html|publisher=Culperer Star Exponent|date=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Gebert performed in minor roles in 15 episodes of various television series, such as ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' (1 episode, 1959),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Episode 30.

In young adulthood, Gebert enrolled at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], transferred to [[University of Southern California]], and eventually earned a bachelor's degree in architecture at age 25 from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s Department of Architecture in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gebert|first1=Gordon Alan|title=Thesis: A continuing education conference center for Massachusetts Institute of Technology|date=1966|url=https://www.worldcat.org|publisher=Dissertation: Massachusetts Institute of Technology|format=Thesis/dissertation, Manuscript|oclc=24917374}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a master's degree from [[Princeton University]] in 1968.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13032">'''Indonesia Corruption Watch''' (ICW) is an Indonesian-based and led [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) whose primary mission is to monitor and report to the public incidents of corruption in [[Indonesia]]. ICW is also heavily engaged in the prevention and deterrence of corruption through education, cultural change, prosecutions and system reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rachman|first1=Anita|title=In Indonesia, Acceptance of Corruption Starts Young|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indonesiarealtime/2014/05/29/in-indonesia-acceptance-of-corruption-starts-young/|accessdate=10 August 2015|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was formed in [[Jakarta]] on June 21, 1998 to prevent corruption in post-Suharto governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia Corruption Watch: Allard Prize Finalist|url=http://www.allardprize.org/indonesia-corruption-watch-allard-prize-finalist|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|publisher=Peter A.

ICW's work and influence in Indonesia as a major NGO in its field has been recognized and extensively reported on since 1998 by Indonesian and major international news media. The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] considers ICW to be "the leading NGO" focused on fighting corruption in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNODC database Indonesia Corruption Watch (ICW)|url=https://www.unodc.org/ngo/showSingleDetailed.do?req_org_uid=16645|website=UNODC|publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Bank]] cites multiple ICW studies in various World Bank published reports and on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fighting Corruption in Decentralized Indonesia 2007|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTJUSFORPOOR/Resources/FightingCorruptioninDecentralizedIndonesia.pdf|website=WorldBank.org|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Combating Corruption in Indonesia |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTINDONESIA/Resources/Publication/03-Publication/Combating+Corruption+in+Indonesia-Oct15.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050121162752/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTINDONESIA/Resources/Publication/03-Publication/Combating+Corruption+in+Indonesia-Oct15.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 January 2005 |website=WorldBank.org |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=9 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ICW's work and reports have also been cited in hundreds of academic works, books and journals about governmental and societal corruption.

Other recent indications of ICW's notability and influence include a request by the Jakarta Governor Basuki "Ahok" Tjahaja Prnama that ICW monitor the performance of government units under his administration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ahok setting up anti corruption system|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/11/02/ahok-setting-anti-corruption-system.html|accessdate=9 August 2015|issue=2 November 2013|publisher=Jakarta Post|date=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ahok Requests ICW to Monitor Jakarta Officials|url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2014/08/12/057598977/Ahok-Requests-ICW-to-Monitor-Jakarta-Officials|accessdate=9 August 2015|publisher=Tempo International Media TBK|date=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arrests and reported harassment of ICW staff and activists by Indonesian police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Graft activists face questioning  over libel|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/07/27/graft-activists-face-questioning-over-libel.html|accessdate=9 August 2015|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police told to stop harassment  of activists|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/07/28/police-told-stop-harassment-activists.html|accessdate=9 August 2015|publisher=Jakarta Post|date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 2, 2015, Indonesian President Joko Widodo appointed former Indonesia Corruption Watch head [[Teten Masduki]] as his new chief of staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Activist in the Hot Seat|url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2015/09/09/080698916/Activist-in-the-Hot-Seat|accessdate=15 September 2015|agency=Tempo|publisher=Tempo.co|date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indonesian Culture of Corruption ==

Indonesia has a serious problem with widespread corruption, which has been described as 'rampant' and impacting people from birth until death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gunawan|first1=T.

== History and Role ==

ICW was created on June 21, 1998, a few weeks after the resignation of President [[Suharto]], by social activist [[Teten Masduki]], lawyer [[Todung Mulya Lubis]], economist [[Faisal Basri]] and other persons in the midst of a reform movement aimed at ensuring that any post-Suharto government would be democratic and free of corruption.

After the fall of Suharto it soon became apparent that the subsequent introduction of a decentralized mode of government with increased regional autonomy produced more corruption, and made its detection and control more difficult. Corruption in Indonesia was no longer organized and centralized, but became fragmented as new regional power centres and leaders emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fighting Corruption in Decentralized Indonesia 2007|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTJUSFORPOOR/Resources/FightingCorruptioninDecentralizedIndonesia.pdf|website=WorldBank.org|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ICW|url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=id&amp;u=http://antikorupsi.info/id/icw&amp;usg=ALkJrhjtIiJ6o4VFG-qWIDslEREiRtrROw|website=Indonesia Corruption Watch, Google translated to English|publisher=Indonesia Corruption Watch|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this emerging situation ICW focused on bringing cases of corruption to the public and law enforcement agencies, monitoring campaign and political finance spending in national and local elections and pushing for anti-corruption laws such as the [[Freedom of Information Act]], the [[Whistleblower Protection Act]], Anti-corruption Act and Election Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia Corruption Watch: Allard Prize Finalist|url=http://www.allardprize.org/indonesia-corruption-watch-allard-prize-finalist|website=Allard Prize for International Integrity|publisher=Peter A.

Allard School of Law|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common News Media Naming Error ==

ICW's actual name in English is 'Indonesia Corruption Watch', as displayed in the organization's website and ICW's published reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official ICW website homepage|url=http://antikorupsi.info|website=Indonesia Corruption Watch|publisher=Indonesia Corruption Watch|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archive searches of many major news organizations show that ICW's name is often reported in error as 'Indonesian Corruption Watch'. This inconsistent use of two names (one of them wrong) by the news media presents challenges to journalists and others researching ICW because two separate searches of each database are required to retrieve all news stories and available information. For instance, as of August 9, 2015 separate searches of the New York Times online archives are necessary to return 11 news stories under 'Indonesia Corruption Watch'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New York Times archive search Indonesia Corruption Watch|url=https://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/?action=click&amp;contentCollection&amp;region=TopBar&amp;WT.nav=searchWidget&amp;module=SearchSubmit&amp;pgtype=Homepage#/"indonesia%20corruption%20watch"|accessdate=9 August 2015|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an additional 8 news stories under 'Indonesian Corruption Watch',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New York Times - archive search 'Indonesian Corruption Watch'|url=https://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/?action=click&amp;contentCollection&amp;region=TopBar&amp;WT.nav=searchWidget&amp;module=SearchSubmit&amp;pgtype=Homepage#/%22indonesian+corruption+watch%22/|accessdate=9 August 2015|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Indonesia Corruption Watch (ICW) the intended subject of each news story reference. Other major news organizations' archives exhibit the same error in various proportions.

This frequently occurring naming error is also evident in government and academic publications. For instance, in the World Bank 2003 report Combating Corruption in Indonesia, both the correct and incorrect versions of ICW's official name are published in the same document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Combating Corruption In Indonesia |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTINDONESIA/Resources/Publication/03-Publication/Combating+Corruption+in+Indonesia-Oct15.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050121162752/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTINDONESIA/Resources/Publication/03-Publication/Combating+Corruption+in+Indonesia-Oct15.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 January 2005 |website=World Bank |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=9 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Dance Teachers Association''' ('''IDTA''') is a leading dance teaching and examination board based in [[Brighton]], [[England]].  Operating internationally, the IDTA is one of the largest dance teaching organisations in the world and currently has over 7,000 members in 55 countries. The IDTA is a recognised awarding organisation, recognised by the national qualifications regulators in England and Wales, [[Ofqual]] and the [[Council for Dance Education and Training]], and is also affiliated to the [[British Dance Council]], the [[Central Council of Physical Recreation]] and the Theatre Dance Council International.  The IDTA also works in partnership with the [[Royal Academy of Dance]]. It publishes their magazine for members Dance International
four times a year.

==History==
The International Dance Teachers Association was formed in 1967 as the result of a merger between the ''Dance Teachers' Association'' (DTA), and the ''International Dancing Masters Association'' (IDMA). Both these organisations were themselves formed from the merging of older dance teaching associations, with the earliest being established in 1903. The IDTA subsequently celebrated its centenary in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, Lyndon 1997. ''The story of British popular dance''. International Publications (IDTA), Brighton.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest predecessor of today's IDTA was the ''Manchester and Salford Association of Teachers of Dancing'', founded in 1903.  This later became known as the ''Empire Society'', (ESTD), in 1938.  In 1920, another group of teachers in Birmingham formed the ''Midland Association of Teachers of Dancing'' (MATD), which eventually merged with the Empire Society in 1961 to form the ''Dance Teachers' Association''.

In the early post-[[World War I]] years, a number of other small dance organisations were formed: the ''English Dancing Masters Association'' (EDMA), the ''Premier Association of Teachers of Dancing'' (PATD), the ''Universal Association of Dane Teachers'' (UADT), and the ''Yorkshire Association of Dancing Masters'' (YADM). These four organisations merged in 1930 to form the ''International Dancing Masters' Association''.

The final merger of these organisations in 1967, saw the creation of today's ''International Dance Teachers' Association''.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, p32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The IDTA exists primarily as a dance training and examination board.

For students, the IDTA provides training opportunities with qualified dance teachers worldwide, both in private and mainstream dance education.  Training is available in a wide range of dance disciplines, with examinations leading to a range of awards and certificates for successful candidates, including vocational examinations for students who wish to pursue a career in professional dance.  Examinations and awards are available for a variety of ages and abilities.

The IDTA also awards dance teaching qualifications and has a certification programme for dance students and professionals who wish to gain a recognised dance teaching qualification.  There are three levels of qualification that certify teachers to enter candidates for IDTA examinations, they are ''Associate'', ''Licentiate'' and ''Fellowship''.  Fellowship is the highest level of qualification within the IDTA and teachers who have reached this level may apply to become examiners of the IDTA.

Beyond dance training and examinations, the IDTA is also one of the World's foremost organisations in the field of competitive dancing, and in this role organises numerous competitions, dance festivals and championships both in the UK and internationally, and is influential in the regulation and adjudication of such competitions. In the UK in particular, the IDTA organises the competitions for the much sought after titles of ''[[Miss Dance of Great Britain]]'' and ''[[Dance Master UK]]'', and also the ''IDTA Theatre Dance Championships''. Entrants for these prestigious competitions compete in heats at dance festivals nationwide throughout the year, for a place in the annual National finals in Blackpool.

IDTA issues the quarterly  ''Dance International Magazine'', which is distributed free of charge to all fully paid-up members of the organisation and includes important news for the period ahead. This includes information about any changes to the IDTA examination system, dates of meetings and seminars, general dance news and other vital information that teachers need.

==Dance styles==

The IDTA is divided into two distinct branches, the [[Theatre Dance|Theatre Branch]] and the [[Ballroom Dance|Ballroom Branch]].  Each of these two sectors covers a range of dance styles, each with an elected faculty committee that oversee the standards and development of the discipline.  The IDTA offers the following dance subjects:

===Theatre faculties===
* [[Classical Ballet]]
* [[Freestyle dance|Freestyle]]
* [[Acro dance|Gymnastic Dance]]
* [[Modern Jazz]]
* [[Musical Theatre]]
* [[Rhythmic Gymnastics]]
* [[Tap dance|Tap]]
* [[Stage dance|Theatrecraft]]

===Ballroom faculties===
* [[Ballroom]] - Foxtrot, Quickstep, Slow Waltz, Tango, Viennese Waltz
* Freestyle
* [[Latin]] - Argentine Tango, Bachata, Cha Cha Cha, Jive, Mambo, Merengue, Paso Doble, Rumba, Salsa, Samba
* [[Sequence dance]] - Saunter, Two Step, [[tango (ballroom)|Tango]], [[Swing (dance)]], [[Gavotte]], [[old time]] waltz, [[blues]]

==Teaching qualifications==

===Theatre branch===
People who wish to become dance teachers with the theatre branch of the IDTA can undertake a teacher training programme with an authorised member of the organisation.  Candidates can undertake teacher training in one of the core theatre dance subjects of Ballet, Tap, Modern Jazz or Theatrecraft.  To become recognised as a qualified teacher member of the IDTA, the candidate must achieve '''Associate''' status in at least one of these core subjects, which subsequently authorises them to teach the complete IDTA syllabus in all theatre dance subjects.

There are five levels of certification for candidates undertaking teacher training:
*'''Pre-Associate 1''': Denotes a student teacher who is not permitted to teach without supervision.  Has studied part of the graded syllabus for the relevant subject
*'''Pre-Associate 2''': Denotes a student teacher who is not permitted to teach without supervision.  Has completed study of the graded syllabus for the relevant subject
The following three levels are different levels of qualified teachers and all are authorised to teach the IDTA syllabus and enter candidates for examinations:
*'''Associate (AIDTA)''': A qualified teacher who has completed detailed study in the teaching of the Intermediate syllabus for the relevant subject
*'''Licentiate (LIDTA)''': A qualified teacher who has completed detailed study in the teaching of the Advanced 1 syllabus for the relevant subject
*'''Fellowship (FIDTA)''': A qualified teacher who has completed detailed study in the teaching of the Advanced 2 syllabus for the relevant subject

A teacher who has achieved Fellowship status in all four core subjects of the theatre branch, can apply to become an examiner for the branch.  Candidates who are successful in the selection process to become an examiner, then visit dance schools as a representative of the organisation, assessing pupils' dancing and providing feedback on how they can improve.  They also provide feedback to the teachers, to ensure that standards are being maintained and that the syllabus is being correctly taught.  Examiners can also vote for and be nominated for election to one of the theatre branch's technical committees, which oversee the development of the syllabus in each discipline.  This is one of the most senior roles in the organisation.

==Associations==

From 1 October 2006, the IDTA began a new association with the London-based [[Royal Academy of Dance]].  A press release issued to members of each organisation stated that "the two organisations would embark on a process of working together for the future of dance and to the mutual benefit of their members in both teacher education and training and examinations".

As a result of this association, registered teachers of the IDTA theatre dance branch are admitted as teacher members of the RAD and vice versa, teachers of the RAD are admitted to membership of the theatre branch of the IDTA.  Whilst the new association is not a merger, it is intended that it will develop co-operation between the two organisations and mutual recognition of the training and qualifications that they both provide.  It is also expected that in the future, both the IDTA and RAD will begin to work together, providing new training and development opportunities for members and students of both organisations.

'''James Simester''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 沈雅各; [[Foochow Romanized]]: ''Sīng Ngā-gáuk''; [[Pinyin]]: ''Shěn Yǎgè''; February 18, 1871 - October 19, 1905) was an American [[Methodist]] missionary and educator to Foochow, China.

==Life==
Born on February 18, 1871 in [[Huntington, Staffordshire]], [[England]], James Simester was converted at age fourteen and called to preach when sixteen. He received [[A.B.]] from [[Baldwin University]] in 1893, and [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] in 1901, [[D.D.]] in 1904, and [[Bachelor of Divinity|B.D.]] from [[Drew Theological Seminary]] in 1896.&lt;ref name="drew"&gt;Alumni record of Drew Theological Seminary, 1867-1905&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered the Newark Conference in 1896, and had several appointments (1890 in [[Strongsville, Ohio]], 1891 and 1892 in [[Litchfield, Ohio]] and [[Whippany, New Jersey]]) before transferring to the [[Foochow]] Conference in China in 1896. He married Winifred Smack (1875 - 1952) in [[Madison, New Jersey]] on August 6, 1896,&lt;ref name="smack"&gt;The Smack family letters&lt;/ref&gt; and the couple arrived in Foochow on September 27, 1896.&lt;ref name="drew"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bashford"&gt;[[James Whitford Bashford|Bashford, James Whitford]] (1906): ''China and Methodism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Baldwin School of Theology]] from 1904 to 1905. He also worked as the editor of the Educational Department of the Methodist Forum from 1902 to 1903, and the editor of Sunday-school Literature, Foochow Conference, from 1899 to 1903.&lt;ref name="drew"/&gt;

James Simester died of [[Dengue fever]] on October 19, 1905 in Foochow.&lt;ref name="smack"/&gt; His widow and four children went back to America and resided at [[Delaware, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="drew"/&gt; His daughter, Edith Winifred Simester, returned to Foochow and worked here as a missionary in the 1930s and 40s.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{cite web | title = Guide to the Edith Winifred Simester Papers, 1930-1952 | url = http://nwda-db.wsulibs.wsu.edu/findaid/ark:/80444/xv18821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calarco is a member of [[ACTRA]] and the [[Actors' Equity Association]]. His most recent works include ''[[A Dark Truth]]'', ''The Riverbank'' (also known as ''Tracing Iris'') and ''One Wish''. ''One Wish'' won the [[Mexico City International Film Festival]]'s Golden Palm Award and the [[Canada International Film Festival]]'s Award of Excellence.&lt;ref name="northbaynipissing"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.northbaynipissing.com/2012/03/one-wish-receives-acclaim-at-west-coast-film-festiva/ |title=One Wish receives acclaim at west coast film festival |publisher=Northbaynipissing.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Calarco established North Star Talent Agency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sootoday.com/content/arts/details.asp?c=29797 |title=New talent agency represents northern actors |publisher=Sootoday.com |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; with producer [[Brigitte Kingsley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baytoday.ca/content/news/details.asp?c=34963 |title=City sees first talent agency open |publisher=Baytoday.ca |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; to better represent actors from northern Ontario.

''[[North Bay Nugget]]'' was released in September 2013: "Calarco can now add the Northern Flicks Award — ''top honours'' in [[CTV Television Network]] Best in Shorts competition — to his list of awards from a film that put the spotlight on [[dementia]] and [[Alzheimer's]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nugget.ca/2013/09/25/film-strangers-earns-honour|title=Strangers earns honour|work=North Bay Nugget}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Knut Almlöf''' (9 February 1829 [[Stockholm]] – 3 January 1899, Almnäs, Gripsholm), was a Swedish stage actor.  He was an elite actors of the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] and belonged to the most famed stage actors of his time in Sweden. 

==Life==
Knut Almlöf was the son of the actors [[Nils Almlöf]] and Brita Catharina Cederberg. 

He had an early enthusiasm to become an actor. His father, one of his country's most famous actors, did not want him to become an actor, and sent him to be educated to a priest in Uppsala.  His mother died when he was nine, and the year after, his father remarried the celebrated [[Charlotta Almlöf|Charlotta Ficker]] of the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]]. She encouraged Knut in his interest for the theatre, and after his graduation in 1848, they convinced his father about his preference. 

In 1851, he joined the troupe of [[Pierre Deland]], where he married his colleague [[Betty Deland]]. He was employed at the theatre ''[[Mindre teatern]]'' in Stockholm in 1861, and in the Royal Dramatic Theatre in 1863.  

He was regarded to have a natural way of acting and was referred to as a genius in comedy. 

In 1874–77, he was joint principal of ''[[Dramatens elevskola]]'' with his wife.  He took the death of his wife 1882 very hard and retired from the theatre, but continued to act as a guest artist until 1897.

{{Linguistics}}

'''Language education''' refers to the process and practice of acquiring a second or foreign language. It is primarily a branch of [[applied linguistics]], however can be considered an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field.&lt;ref&gt;Spolsky, B., &amp; Hult, F.M. (Eds.). (2008). ''Handbook of educational linguistics.'' Malden, MA: Blackwell. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M., (Ed.). (2010). ''Directions and prospects for educational linguistics.''  New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; There are four main learning categories for language education: communicative competencies, proficiencies, [[cross-cultural communication|cross-cultural experiences]], and multiple literacies.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, J. K. (2007). Foreign Language Education: Whose Definition?. ''The Modern Language Journal'', ''91''(2), 266–268. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] 00267902&lt;/ref&gt;

== Need ==
Increasing [[globalization]] has created a great need for people in the workforce who can communicate in multiple languages. Common languages are used in areas such as trade, tourism, international relations, technology, media, and science. Many countries such as [[Korea]] (Kim Yeong-seo, 2009), [[Japan]] (Kubota, 1998) and [[China]] (Kirkpatrick &amp; Zhichang, 2002) frame education policies to teach at least one foreign language at the primary and secondary school levels. However, some countries such as [[India]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Pakistan]], and the [[Philippines]] use a second official language in their governments. According to [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] (2010), China has recently been putting enormous importance on foreign language learning, especially [[the English language]].

==History==

===Ancient to medieval period===
The need to learn foreign languages is as old as human history itself. In the Ancient Near East, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] was the language of diplomacy, as in the [[Amarna letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scoville |first1=Priscila |title=Amarna Letters |url=https://www.ancient.eu/Amarna_Letters/ |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many centuries, [[Latin]] was the dominant language of education, commerce, religion, and government in much of Europe, but it was displaced for many purposes by French, Italian, and English by the end of the 16th century. [[John Amos Comenius]] was one of many people who tried to reverse this trend. He wrote a complete course for learning Latin, covering the entire school curriculum, culminating in his ''Opera Didactica Omnia'', 1657.

In this work, Comenius also outlined his theory of [[language acquisition]]. He is one of the first theorists to write systematically about how languages are learned and about methods for teaching languages. He held that language acquisition must be allied with sensation and experience. Teaching must be oral. The schoolroom should have models of things, or else pictures of them. He published the world's first illustrated children's book, ''[[Orbis sensualium pictus]]''. The study of Latin gradually diminished from the study of a living language to a mere subject in the school curriculum. This decline demanded a new justification for its study. It was then claimed that the study of Latin developed intellectual ability, and the study of Latin grammar became an end in and of itself.

"Grammar schools" from the 16th to 18th centuries focused on teaching the grammatical aspects of Classical Latin. Advanced students continued grammar study with the addition of rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book |title=Approaches and Methods in Language Teaching |last=Richards|first=Jack C. |author2=Theodore S. Rodgers |year=2001|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge UK |ISBN=0-521-00843-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
The study of modern languages did not become part of the curriculum of European schools until the 18th century. Based on the purely academic study of Latin, students of modern languages did much of the same exercises, studying grammatical rules and translating abstract sentences. Oral work was minimal, and students were instead required to memorize grammatical rules and apply these to decode written texts in the target language. This tradition-inspired method became known as the [[grammar translation|grammar-translation method]].&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

===19th and 20th centuries===
{{globalize/US|date=November 2010}}
[[File:Sweet Henry.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Henry Sweet]] was a key figure in establishing the [[applied linguistics]] tradition in language teaching]]
Innovation in foreign language teaching began in the 19th century and became very rapid in the 20th century. It led to a number of different and sometimes conflicting methods, each claiming to be a major improvement over the previous or contemporary methods. The earliest applied linguists included Jean Manes ca, [[Heinrich Gottfried Ollendorff]] (1803–1865), [[Henry Sweet]] (1845–1912), [[Otto Jespersen]] (1860–1943), and [[Harold E. Palmer|Harold Palmer]] (1877–1949). They worked on setting language teaching principles and approaches based on linguistic and psychological theories, but they left many of the specific practical details for others to devise.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

The history of foreign-language education in the 20th century and the methods of teaching (such as those related below) might appear to be a history of failure. Very few students in U.S. universities who have a foreign language as a major attain "minimum professional proficiency". Even the "reading knowledge" required for a PhD degree is comparable only to what second-year language students read, and only very few researchers who are native English speakers can read and assess information written in languages other than English. Even a number of famous linguists are monolingual.&lt;ref name="Diller"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Language Teaching Controversy |last=Diller |first=Karl Conrad |year=1978 |publisher=Newbury House |location=Rowley, Massachusetts |isbn=0-912066-22-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, anecdotal evidence for successful second or foreign language learning is easy to find, leading to a discrepancy between these cases and the failure of most language programs. This tends to make the research of [[second language acquisition]] emotionally charged. Older methods and approaches such as the [[grammar translation method]] and the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]] are dismissed and even ridiculed, as newer methods and approaches are invented and promoted as the only and complete solution to the problem of the high failure rates of foreign language students.

Most books on language teaching list the various methods that have been used in the past, often ending with the author's new method. These new methods are usually presented as coming only from the author's mind, as the authors generally give no credence to what was done before and do not explain how it relates to the new method. For example, descriptive linguists{{Who|date=December 2009}} seem to claim unhesitatingly that there were no scientifically based language teaching methods before their work (which led to the [[audio-lingual method]] developed for the U.S. Army in World War II). However, there is significant evidence to the contrary. It is also often inferred or even stated that older methods were completely ineffective or have died out completely, though in reality even the oldest methods are still in use (e.g. the [[Maximilian Berlitz|Berlitz]] version of the direct method). Proponents of new methods have been so sure that their ideas are so new and so correct that they could not conceive that the older ones have enough validity to cause controversy. This was in turn caused by emphasis on new scientific advances, which has tended to blind researchers to precedents in older work.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;5)

There have been two major branches in the field of language learning, the empirical and theoretical, and these have almost completely separate histories, with each gaining ground over the other at one time or another. Examples of researchers on the empiricist side are Jesperson, Palmer, and [[Leonard Bloomfield]], who promote mimicry and memorization with pattern drills. These methods follow from the basic empiricist position that language acquisition results from habits formed by conditioning and drilling. In its most extreme form, language learning is seen as much the same as any other learning in any other species, human language being essentially the same as communication behaviors seen in other species.

On the theoretical side are, for example, Francois Gouin, M.D. Berlitz, and [[Emile B. De Sauzé]], whose rationalist theories of language acquisition dovetail with linguistic work done by [[Noam Chomsky]] and others. These have led to a wider variety of teaching methods, ranging from the grammar-translation method and Gouin's "series method" to the direct methods of Berlitz and De Sauzé. With these methods, students generate original and meaningful sentences to gain a functional knowledge of the rules of grammar. This follows from the rationalist position that man is born to think and that language use is a uniquely human trait impossible in other species. Given that human languages share many common traits, the idea is that humans share a [[universal grammar]] which is built into our brain structure. This allows us to create sentences that we have never heard before but that can still be immediately understood by anyone who understands the specific language being spoken. The rivalry between the two camps is intense, with little communication or cooperation between them.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

=== 21st century ===
Over time, language education has developed in schools and has become a part of the education curriculum around the world. In some countries, such as the United States, language education (also referred to as World Languages) has become a core subject along with main subjects such as English, Maths and Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.actfl.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/21stCenturySkillsMap/p21_worldlanguagesmap.pdf|title=American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages|website=www.actfl.org|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, such as Australia, it is so common nowadays for a foreign language to be taught in schools that the subject of language education is referred to [[Languages Other Than English|LOTE]] or Language Other Than English. In the majority of English-speaking education centers, French, Spanish and German are the most popular languages to study and learn. English As A Second Language is also available for students whose first language is not English and they are unable to speak it to the required standard.

==Teaching foreign language in classrooms==
{{main article|Methods of teaching foreign languages}}

[[File:Spanish class.jpg|thumb|right|[[High school]] [[Spanish language|Spanish]] taught as a second [[language]] to a class of native [[English speakers]] at an [[United States|American]] [[private school]] in [[Massachusetts]].]]
Language education may take place as a general school subject or in a specialized '''[[language school]]'''. There are many methods of teaching languages. Some have fallen into relative obscurity and others are widely used; still others have a small following, but offer useful insights.

While sometimes confused, the terms "approach", "method" and "technique" are hierarchical concepts.

An '''approach''' is a set of assumptions about the nature of language and language learning, but does not involve procedure or provide any details about how such assumptions should be implemented into the classroom setting. Such can be related to [[second language acquisition theory]].

There are three principal "approaches":
# The structural view treats language as a system of structurally related elements to code meaning (e.g. grammar).
# The functional view sees language as a vehicle to express or accomplish a certain function, such as requesting something.
# The interactive view sees language as a vehicle for the creation and maintenance of social relations, focusing on patterns of moves, acts, negotiation and interaction found in conversational exchanges. This approach has been fairly dominant since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

A '''method''' is a plan for presenting the language material to be learned, and should be based upon a selected approach. In order for an approach to be translated into a method, an instructional system must be designed considering the objectives of the teaching/learning, how the content is to be selected and organized, the types of tasks to be performed, the roles of students, and the roles of teachers.
# Examples of structural methods are [[grammar translation]] and the [[audio-lingual method]].
# Examples of functional methods include the oral approach / situational language teaching.
# Examples of interactive methods include the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]], the series method, [[communicative language teaching]], [[language immersion]], the [[Silent Way]], [[Suggestopedia]], the [[Natural Approach]], [[Tandem language learning|Tandem Language Learning]], [[Total Physical Response]], [[Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling]] and [[Dogme language teaching]].

A '''technique''' (or strategy) is a very specific, concrete stratagem or trick designed to accomplish an immediate objective. Such are derived from the controlling method, and less directly, from the approach.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

==Online and self-study courses==
Hundreds of languages are available for self-study, from scores of publishers, for a range of costs, using a variety of methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews of Language Self-Study Courses: Comparison, Problems, Ratings|url=http://Lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course itself acts as a teacher and has to choose a methodology, just as classroom teachers do.

===Audio recordings and books===
Audio '''recordings''' use native speakers, and one strength is helping learners improve their accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Accents|url=http://lastly.weebly.com/2/category/accent/1.html|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recordings have pauses for the learner to speak. Others are continuous so the learner speaks along with the recorded voice, similar to learning a song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shadowing Step by Step|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=130bOvRpt24|work=ForeignLanguageExpertise.com|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio recordings for self-study use many of the methods used in classroom teaching, and have been produced on records, tapes, CDs, DVDs and websites.

Most audio recordings teach words in the target language by using explanations in the learner's own language. An alternative is to use sound effects to show meaning of words in the target language.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Hear-Say'', by Donald Rivera, Penton Overseas Inc., {{ISBN|1-56015-677-5}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-350-0}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-353-5}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-349-7}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-351-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aaa.Lang1234.com | title=Lessons for Beginners in English, mp3 | date=15 August 2013 | accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only language in such recordings is the target language, and they are comprehensible regardless of the learner's native language.

Language '''books''' have been published for centuries, teaching vocabulary and grammar. The simplest books are phrasebooks to give useful short phrases for travelers, cooks, receptionists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hhh.Lang1234.com | title=Workers and Guests Have Different Language Needs in a Hotel | date=20 April 2013 | accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or others who need specific vocabulary. More complete books include more vocabulary, grammar, exercises, translation, and writing practice.

Also, various other "language learning tools" have been entering the market in recent years.

===Internet and software===
'''Software''' can interact with learners in ways that books and audio cannot:

# Some software records the learner, analyzes the pronunciation, and gives feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scoring Your Pronunciation|url=http://lastly.weebly.com/3/post/2012/08/pronunciation.html|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Software can present additional exercises in areas where a particular learner has difficulty, until the concepts are mastered.
# Software can pronounce words in the target language and show their meaning by using pictures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Language Guide|url=http://Languageguide.org|publisher=Language Guide|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of oral explanations. The only language in such software is the target language. It is comprehensible regardless of the learner's native language.

'''Websites''' provide various services geared toward language education. Some sites are designed specifically for learning languages:

# Some software runs on the web itself, with the advantage of avoiding downloads, and the disadvantage of requiring an internet connection.
# Some publishers use the web to distribute audio, texts and software, for use offline. For example, various travel guides, for example Lonely Planet, offer software supporting language education.
# Some websites offer learning activities such as quizzes or puzzles to practice language concepts.
# [[Language exchange]] sites connect users with complementary language skills, such as a native Spanish speaker who wants to learn English with a native English speaker who wants to learn Spanish. Language exchange websites essentially treat ''knowledge of a language'' as a commodity, and provide a marketlike environment for the commodity to be exchanged. Users typically contact each other via chat, [[Voice over IP|VoIP]], or email. Language exchanges have also been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at [[language school]]s. Language exchanges tend to benefit oral proficiency, fluency, colloquial vocabulary acquisition, and vernacular usage, rather than formal grammar or writing skills. Across Australasia, 'Language Perfect' - an online vocabulary learning site- is frequently used as it enables teachers to monitor students' progress as students gain a "point" for every new word remembered. There is an annual international Language Perfect contest held in May.

Many other websites are helpful for learning languages, even though they are designed, maintained and marketed for other purposes:

# All countries have websites in their own languages, which learners elsewhere can use as primary material for study: news, fiction, videos, songs, etc. In a study conducted by the [[Center for Applied Linguistics]], it was noted that the use of technology and media has begun to play a heavy role in facilitating language learning in the classroom. With the help of the internet, students are readily exposed to foreign media (music videos, television shows, films) and as a result, teachers are taking heed of the internet's influence and are searching for ways to combine this exposure into their classroom teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Can Learn From Foreign Language Teaching In Other Countries|url=http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/0106pufahl.html|publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Translation sites let learners find the meaning of foreign text or create foreign translations of text from their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://translate.google.com/ | title=Google Translate | accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bing.com/translator | title=Bing Translator | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Speech synthesis]] or text to speech (TTS) sites and software let learners hear pronunciation of arbitrary written text, with pronunciation similar to a native speaker.
# Course development and [[learning management system]]s such as [[Moodle]] are used by teachers, including language teachers.
# [[Web conferencing]] tools can bring remote learners together; e.g. [[Elluminate Live]].
# Players of computer games can practice a target language when interacting in [[massively multiplayer online game]]s and [[virtual worlds]]. In 2005, the virtual world [[Second Life]] started to be used for foreign language tuition, sometimes with entire businesses being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Xavier |last=Dorveaux |title=Study and teach in Second Life |url=http://www.its-teachers.com/destinations/second_life/second_life03.asp |work=iT's Magazines |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate= 15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Xavier |last=Dorveaux |title=Apprendre une langue dans un monde virtuel |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0,36-935560,0.html |work=Le Monde |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate= 15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Spain’s language and cultural institute [[Instituto Cervantes]] has an "island" on Second Life.
Some Internet content is free, often from government and nonprofit sites such as [[Bbc Online#Knowledge and Learning|BBC Online]], Book2, [[Foreign Service Institute]], with no or minimal ads. Some are ad-supported, such as newspapers and YouTube. Some require a payment.

==Learning strategies==
[[Language learning strategies]] have attracted increasing focus as a way of understanding the process of language acquisition.

===Listening as a way of learning===
Clearly listening is used to learn, but not all language learners employ it consciously. Listening to understand is one level of listening but focused listening&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/improving-listening-skills/ focused listening]&lt;/ref&gt; is not something that most learners employ as a strategy.

===Reading as a way to learn===
Many people read to understand but the strategy of reading text to learn grammar and discourse styles can also be employed.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/learning-grammar/ strategy of reading]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning vocabulary===

Translation and rote memorization have been the two strategies that have been employed traditionally. There are other strategies that also can be used such as guessing, based on looking for contextual clues, spaced repetition with a use of various apps, games and tools (e.g. [http://www.duolingo.com DuoLingo], [http://www.LingoMonkey.com LingoMonkey] and [http://www.vocabularystickers.com Vocabulary Stickers]). Knowledge about how the brain works can be utilized in creating strategies for how to remember words.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/how-to-remember-vocabulary/ How to remember vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code switching===
{{Main article|Code-switching}}
Code switching, that is, changing between languages at some point in a sentence or [[utterance]], is a commonly used communication strategy among language learners and bilinguals. While traditional methods of formal instruction often discourage code switching, students, especially those placed in a language immersion situation, often use it. If viewed as a [[study skills|learning strategy]], wherein the student uses the target language as much as possible but reverts to their native language for any element of an utterance that they are unable to produce in the target language (as, e.g., in [[Wolfgang Butzkamm]]'s concept of enlightened monolingualism), then it has the advantages that it encourages fluency development and motivation and a sense of accomplishment by enabling the student to discuss topics of interest to him or her early in the learning process—before requisite vocabulary has been memorized. It is particularly effective for students whose native language is English, due to the high probability of a simple English word or short phrase being understood by the conversational partner.&lt;ref&gt;Butzkamm, Wolfgang (1998). "Code-Switching in a Bilingual History Lesson: The Mother Tongue as a Conversational Lubricant". ''International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism'' 1:2, pp. 81–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching strategies==

===Blended learning===
{{Main article|Blended learning}}
Blended learning combines face-to-face teaching with [[distance education]], frequently electronic, either computer-based or web-based. It has been a major growth point in the ELT (English Language Teaching) industry over the last ten years. {{when|date=May 2016}}

Some people, though, use the phrase 'Blended Learning' to refer to learning taking place while the focus is on other activities. For example, playing a card game that requires calling for cards may allow blended learning of numbers (1 to 10).

===Skill teaching===
When talking about language skills, the four basic ones are: listening, speaking, reading and writing. However, other, more socially based skills have been identified more recently such as summarizing, describing, narrating etc. In addition, more general learning skills such as study skills and knowing how one learns have been applied to language classrooms.&lt;ref name="Holden"&gt;{{cite book |title=English language teaching |last=Holden |first=Susan |author2=Mickey Rodgers  |year=1998 |publisher=DELTI |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-6820-12-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s, the four basic skills were generally taught in isolation in a very rigid order, such as listening before speaking. However, since then, it has been recognized that we generally use more than one skill at a time, leading to more integrated exercises.&lt;ref name="Holden"/&gt; Speaking is a skill that often is underrepresented in the traditional classroom. This is due to the fact that it is considered harder to teach and test. There are numerous texts on teaching and testing writing but relatively few on speaking.

More recent textbooks stress the importance of students working with other students in pairs and groups, sometimes the entire class. Pair and group work give opportunities for more students to participate more actively. However, supervision of pairs and groups is important to make sure everyone participates as equally as possible. Such activities also provide opportunities for peer teaching, where weaker learners can find support from stronger classmates.&lt;ref name="Holden"/&gt;

===Sandwich technique===
{{main article|Sandwich technique}}
In [[second language acquisition|foreign language teaching]], the '''sandwich technique''' is the oral insertion of an [[idiom|idiomatic translation]] in the [[mother tongue]] between an unknown phrase in the [[second language|learned language]] and its repetition, in order to convey meaning as rapidly and completely as possible. The mother tongue equivalent can be given almost as an aside, with a slight break in the flow of speech to mark it as an intruder.

When modeling a dialogue sentence for students to repeat, the teacher not only gives an oral mother tongue equivalent for unknown words or phrases, but repeats the foreign language phrase before students imitate it: L2 =&gt; L1 =&gt; L2. For example, a [[German language|German]] teacher of [[English language|English]] might engage in the following exchange with the students:

: Teacher: "Let me try - lass mich versuchen - let me try."
: Students: "Let me try."

===Mother tongue mirroring===
{{main article|Mother tongue mirroring}}
Mother tongue mirroring is the adaptation of the time-honoured technique of [[literal translation]] or word-for word translation for pedagogical purposes. The aim is to make foreign constructions salient and transparent to learners and, in many cases, spare them the technical jargon of grammatical analysis. It differs from [[literal translation]] and [[interlinear text]] as used in the past since it takes the progress learners have made into account and only focuses upon a specific structure at a time. As a didactic device, it can only be used to the extent that it remains intelligible to the learner, unless it is combined with a normal idiomatic translation. This technique is seldom referred to or used these days.

===Back-chaining===
{{main article|Back-chaining}}
Back-chaining is a technique used in teaching oral language skills, especially with [[polysyllabic]] or difficult words.&lt;ref name="ue"&gt;"Backchaining." ''Glossary.''

For example, to teach the name ‘[[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]' a teacher will pronounce the last syllable: ''-sky,'' and have the student repeat it. Then the teacher will repeat it with ''-sorg-'' attached before: ''-sorg-sky,'' and all that remains is the first syllable: ''Mus-sorg-sky.''

==By region==
{{main article|Language education by region}}

Practices in language education may vary by region however the underlying understandings which drive it are fundamentally similar. Rote repetition, drilling, memorisation and grammar conjugating are used the world over. Sometimes there are different preferences [[Methods of teaching foreign languages|teaching methods]] by region. [[Language immersion]] is popular in some European countries, but is not used very much in the [[United States]], in [[Asia]] or in [[Australia]].

The languages being learned differ; in the [[United States]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the most popular language to be learned, whereas the most popular languages to be learned in [[Australia]] are [[Italian language|Italian]] and Mandarin Chinese.

==Language study holidays==
{{See also|Language school}}
An increasing number of people are now combining [[tourism|holiday]]s with language study in the native country. This enables the student to experience the target culture by meeting local people. Such a holiday often combines formal lessons, cultural excursions, leisure activities, and a [[homestay]], perhaps with time to travel in the country afterwards. Language study holidays are popular across Europe (Malta &amp; UK being the most popular because almost everyone speaks English as a first language) and Asia due to the ease of transportation and variety of nearby countries. These holidays have become increasingly more popular in Central and South America in such countries as Guatemala, Ecuador and [[ACUPARI|Peru]]. As a consequence of this increasing popularity, several international language education agencies have flourished in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelweek.ca/news/travel-agents-missing-profitable-language-travel-holidays-sprachcaffe/ |title=Travel agents missing out on profitable language travel holidays – Sprachcaffe |publisher=TravelWeek|date= |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;


With the increasing prevalence of international business transactions, it is now important to have multiple languages at one's disposal. This is also evident in businesses outsourcing their departments to Eastern Europe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Minority language education==

===Minority language education policy===
The principal policy arguments in favor of promoting minority language education are the need for multilingual workforces, intellectual and cultural benefits and greater inclusion in global information society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/community |title=Community Languages in Higher Education: Towards realising the potential |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=Sachdev |first=I |author2=McPake, J  |year=2008 |pages=76 |publisher=Routes into Languages }}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to education in a minority language is also seen as a human right as granted by the [[European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]], the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] and the [[UN Human Rights Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2004/minority_education/edminlang |title=The right to education and minority language |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=de Varennes |first=Fernand |year=2004 |publisher=EUMAP: EU Monitoring and Advocacy Program Online Journal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404121819/http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2004/minority_education/edminlang |archivedate=4 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M.

''Language Policy, 3''(2), 181-201.&lt;/ref&gt; Bilingual Education has been implemented in many countries including the United States, in order to promote both the use and appreciation of the minority language, as well as the majority language concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cal.org/resources/Digest/ed379915.html |title=Two-Way Bilingual Education Programs in Practice: A National and Local Perspective |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=National Center for Research on Cultural Diversity and Second Language Learning |date=July 1999 |publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314215044/http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/ed379915.html |archivedate=14 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials and e-learning for minority language education===
Suitable resources for teaching and learning minority languages can be difficult to find and access, which has led to calls for the increased development of materials for minority language teaching. The internet offers opportunities to access a wider range of texts, audios and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/community |title=Community Languages in Higher Education: Towards realising the potential |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=Sachdev |first=I |author2=McPake, J  |year=2008 |pages=61–62 |publisher=Routes into Languages }}&lt;/ref&gt; Language [[learning 2.0]] (the use of web 2.0 tools for language education)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.plymouth.ac.uk/e-learning/conference_proceedings_2009.pdf |title=Language learning 2.0 in action: web .0 tools to enhance language learning |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=Diouri |first=Mourad |year=2009 |publisher=4th Plymouth e-Learning Conference 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122165045/http://www2.plymouth.ac.uk/e-learning/conference_proceedings_2009.pdf |archivedate=22 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; offers opportunities for material development for lesser-taught languages and to bring together geographically dispersed teachers and learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/5011 |title=New Roles for Technology in Language Maintenance and Revitalization |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=Ikeda |first=A.

'''Lucy Katherine Partington''' (4 March 1952 – some time between 28 December 1973 and 2 January 1974; aged 21) was a [[British people|British]] murder victim. She was born in [[St Albans]], the third child of Roger and Margaret (Bardwell) Partington. On the night of 27 December 1973, during her final year of reading [[English Literature]] at [[Exeter University]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/04/if-you-sit-very-still-marian-partington-review&lt;/ref&gt; she was abducted by serial killers [[Fred West|Fred]] and [[Rosemary West]]. Her precise date of death is unknown. However, at twenty-five past midnight on 3 January 1974, Fred West admitted himself into the casualty unit at Gloucester Royal hospital with a serious laceration of his right-hand that required several stitches, leading to speculation that she could have been kept alive and tortured for several days in the cellar of the Wests' home in Cromwell Street before finally being murdered.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/may/11/features11.g2&lt;/ref&gt; Her remains were discovered there on 6 March 1994 alongside the knife Fred West used to dismember them. 

On 16 February 1995, Partington's remains were reburied in Exeter, Devon.

Partington’s sister, [[Marian Partington]], wrote about the impact of Lucy’s life, disappearance, and death in her memoir, ''If You Sit Very Still'', in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-2146816/Lucy--victim-darkness-source-light.html&lt;/ref&gt; The book builds on ''Salvaging the Sacred'', an essay written by Marian and published in ''[[The Guardian]] Weekend'' in May 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Marian Partington, Salvaging the Sacred: Lucy, My Sister, originally published in The Guardian Weekend, 18 May 1996 and reissued by Quaker Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The essay inspired a play by Bryony Lavery and a feature film by Juliet McKoen, both entitled ''Frozen''.

Partington was the cousin of novelist [[Martin Amis]]. He dedicated his novel ''[[The Information (novel)|The Information]]'' to her and writes about her life and death in his memoir ''[[Experience (book)|Experience]]''.

The '''National Socialist Teachers League''' ([[German language|German]]: {{lang|de|'''Nationalsozialistische Lehrerbund'''}}, '''NSLB'''), was established on 21 April 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pine |first=L. |title=Education in Nazi Germany |location=Oxford |publisher=Berg |year=2010 |pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its original name was the Organization of National Socialist Educators.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Zentner]] and [[Friedemann Bedürftig]] ''[[The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich]]'' New York: Macmillan 1991 p.435&lt;/ref&gt; Its founder and first leader was former schoolteacher and [[Bayreuth]] [[Gauleiter]] [[Hans Schemm]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Zentner]] and [[Friedemann Bedürftig]] ''[[The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich]]'' New York: Macmillan 1991 p.834&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was based in Bayreuth at the [[House of German Education]]. On October 27, 1938 the NSLB opened its own [[Realschule]] for teacher training in Bayreuth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Zentner]] and [[Friedemann Bedürftig]] ''[[The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich]]'' New York: Macmillan 1991 pp.435-6&lt;/ref&gt;

After Schemm's death in 1935, the new leader, or ''Reichswalter'', was [[Fritz Wächtler]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Zentner]] and [[Friedemann Bedürftig]] ''[[The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich]]'' New York: Macmillan 1991 pp.435-6&lt;/ref&gt;

This organization saw itself as "the common effort of all persons who saw themselves as teachers or wanted to be seen as educators, independently from background or education and from the type of educational institution". Its goal was to make the [[Nazism|National Socialist]] worldview and foundation of all education and especially of schooling. In order to achieve this it sought to have an effect on the political viewpoint of educators, insisting on the further development of their spirit along Nationalsocialist lines. Organized mountain excursions in places called {{lang|de|Reichsaustauschlager}} (Exchange Camps of the Reich) were perceived as helping in this purpose.

The organization was dissolved in 1943 by the financial administration of the NSDAP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/Lexikon/Nationalsozialistischer_Lehrerbund_(NSLB),_1929-1943#Bedeutungsverlust_und_Aufl.C3.B6sung Bedeutungsverlust und Auflösung]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4530">'''Nikolay Nikolayevich Konstantinov'''  ({{lang-ru|Николай Николаевич Константинов}}; born 2 January 1932) is a leading [[USSR|Soviet]] and [[Russia]]n [[mathematical education|mathematical educator]] and organizer of numerous [[mathematics competitions]] for [[high school student]]s.  He is best known as the creator and chief organizer of the [[Tournament of the Towns]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amt.edu.au/imtot.html International Mathematics Tournament of Towns]&lt;/ref&gt;  For his work he was awarded the [[Paul Erdős]] award in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amt.edu.au/wfnmcaw.html David Hilbert and Paul Erdös Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Konstantinov was born and grew up in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]].  He graduated from the [[MSU Faculty of Physics|Physics Department]] of the [[Lomonosov Moscow State University|Moscow State University]] in 1954, and later received a [[Ph.D.]] in [[physics]].

In the 1950s he started  a [[math circle]] in Moscow University and since the 1960s in a number of Moscow high schools.  He continued working with schools developing special classes with mathematics concentration and individual approach to learning.  His students went on to win mathematics competitions on all levels and dozens of them became well known mathematicians.

In 1978, Konstantinov started the [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]] tournament, a multi-subject science competition.  This tournament is continued every year since then.  In 1980, he started the international [[Tournament of the Towns]] which is now organized in over 150 towns in 25 countries.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.amt.canberra.edu.au/mc19912.html Birth of the Tournament of the Towns]", an article by N.N. Konstantinov, J.B. Tabov and P.J.

In 1990 Konstantinov was one of the founders of [[Independent University of Moscow]], one of the leading institutions of higher learning in mathematics in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://shkolazhizni.ru/archive/0/n-15786/ Why Konstantinov is a legend]" (in [[Russian language|Russian]]), an article in ''Shkola Zhizni'' magazine, 25 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even now, in his late 80's, Konstantinov continues working in Moscow High School 179 and is an editor of [[Kvant magazine]], a popular Russian science publication.

'''The Nordic Centre in India (NCI)''' is a consortium of leading universities and research institutions in [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]. It was established in 2001 with the objective to facilitate cooperation in research and higher education between the Nordic countries and [[India]]. Through academic exchange NCI seeks to strengthen Indo-Nordic ties and understanding.
{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== History ==

The possibility to establish a Nordic centre in India was discussed already in 1995 during a meeting of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090928011328/http://www.svf.uib.no/sfu/nasa/ Nordic Association of South Asian Studies] (NASA), an organization established in 1990 to promote exchanges between researchers and students in South Asia Studies. As a result of this and following discussions, the Nordic Centre in India (NCI) was founded in April 2001 at the inaugural General Assembly in Copenhagen as a consortium of leading universities and research institutions in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. The main objective of the consortium, which initially consisted of eight member universities and research institutions in the Nordic countries, was to strengthen and enhance Indian and South Asian studies in the Nordic countries and to support activities in India and with Indian counterparts.

The first years of NCI were devoted to the recruitment of new members of the consortium, to setting up the offices in India and in the Nordic region, identifying collaboration partners in India and tailoring shorter training programs and summer courses in India for students from the member universities. In 2004, NCI was approved by the [[Indian government]] and could set up a liaison office in India. A formal decision on the approval was taken by the Minister for Human Resources Development and publicly announced during an official visit to India by the Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister in October 2004.

== Organisation ==
The organizational structure of the Nordic Centre in India consists of the General Assembly, the Board, and the Director. The General Assembly includes representatives from all the Nordic member universities and handles all matters of principle and of strategic importance for the NCI. The Board consists of one elected Chairperson and five members and their deputies from each Nordic country and ensures that NCI operates in accordance with its aims and regulations. The Director is appointed for a fixed period of time and is responsible for the daily activities. The Nordic secretariat and office of NCI circulates between the member universities and is currently located at the [http://www.umu.se/english/education/ Umeå University, Sweden].

'''Positive handling''' is a term used in [[United Kingdom|British]] primary and [[Special education|special-needs education]] for [[physical restraint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reid|first1=Ken|last2=Morgan|first2=Nicola S.|title=Tackling Behaviour in Your Primary School: A Practical Handbook for Teachers|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415670234|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neEGycAflMYC&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=%22positive%20handling%22&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q=%22positive%20handling%22&amp;f=false|quote=In fact restraint is often referred to by professionals as "positive handling"}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "risk-reduced physical interventions that form part of the [[Holism|holistic]] response"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hayden|first1=Carol|title=Children in Trouble: The Role of Families, Schools and Communities|date=2007|isbn=9780230207998|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m5gcBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=%22positive%20handling%22&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage&amp;q=%22positive%20handling%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been in use since at least 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Jacqui|title=Hansard: Written answers|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/vo000725/text/00725w19.htm|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=25 July 2000|quote=To improve the education for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties in particular, this year we have:... consulted on additional guidance on promoting positive handling strategies for pupils with severe behavioural difficulties.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive handling refers to a graduated approach that moves towards the control of extreme [[Behavior|behaviour]] by adopting the least intrusive intervention for the shortest period of time to achieve the aim. It is one of the most efficient method of training on how to control a disruptive pupil whilst protecting them, and remaining compliant with legislation.

The objective of prevention and intervention techniques is to prevent [[school violence]] from occurring. Support for staff is the key to handling student aggression in schools.

To support it, the staff requires [[training]], which is also a legal obligation of teaching institutions.The avoidance of any physical intervention is a first priority. The principle involves the graduated use of [[de-escalation]] approaches before resorting to physical intervention as the last resort, if any other approaches have failed or are likely to fail.

Using excessive force is abusive and unlawful, but the danger lies in the term “Minimum Force”. Unintentionally, we can enter a situation known as “[[Unintended consequences|The law of unintended consequence]]”.

Positive Handling is a statutory and mandatory training, in accordance to Section 2 and 3 of the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974|Health and Safety as Work Act 1974]].

It represents a significant investment and undertaking for all staff. Increasingly, staff and managers have expressed the need to acknowledge existing understanding and experience due to raising violence in schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5082">The '''pupil premium''' is a grant given by the government to schools in [[England]] to decrease the attainment gap for the most disadvantaged children, whether by income or by family upheaval. For each pupil who is eligible for [[free school meal]]s, their school receives £1,320 (if a primary school) or £935 (if a secondary school).&lt;ref name="govuk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pupil-premium-conditions-of-grant-2016-to-2017/pupil-premium-2016-to-2017-conditions-of-grant#rates-for-eligible-pupils|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools receive an extra premium of £1,900 for pupils:
*in local authority care
*adopted from care (and the parent self-declares)
*were in care in the last year, which ceased by virtue of a special guardianship order (and the guardian self-declares),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.schoolcircular.co.uk/lib/attachments/Appendix_1_Background_Information_Children_Looked_After_Weds_4_Feb_2015.pdf Background: Children Looked After] School Circular. Accessed 2015-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; residence order or [[Child Arrangement Order]].

Service children also receive an allocation of £300, if a parent is serving in the armed forces or is in receipt of a service pension.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pupil-premium-conditions-of-grant-2016-to-2017/pupil-premium-2016-to-2017-conditions-of-grant#rates-for-eligible-pupils&lt;/ref&gt;

The pupil premium was introduced in 2011 by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative—Liberal Democrat coalition government]] at £488 per pupil. It increased to £600 per pupil in 2012–13 and eligibility was extended to pupils who have been eligible for free school meals at any point in the last six years (known as the 'Ever 6' Free School Meals measure).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413222/The_Pupil_Premium.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audit ==

Schools in receipt of the pupil premium grant are required to account for its use and report this on their websites,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-maintained-schools-must-publish-online#pupil-premium&lt;/ref&gt; and with specific reference to how it is used to help disadvantaged pupils, as part of the [[OFSTED]] inspection framework.&lt;ref name="govuk" /&gt; Ofsted will recommend that a school should conduct an independent pupil premium review if, as a result of a section 5 inspection, it has identified specific issues regarding the provision for disadvantaged pupils.&lt;ref name="govuk_review"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/pupil-premium-reviews|title=Pupil premium reviews|publisher=Gov.uk|date=25 March 2014|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==

The [[Department for Education]] published an evaluation of the introduction of the pupil premium by the [[University of Manchester]] and [[Newcastle University]] in 2013 which reviewed how schools were identifying and targeting disadvantaged pupils for support.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/243919/DFE-RR282.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The think tank [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] published an analysis in January 2015.  They claim that, since 2011, for free school meals-eligible pupils, whose number has grown significantly, the attainment gap has widened, whereas it has narrowed for those in local authority care. It noted the number of free school meal-eligible pupils who achieved 5 GCSEs (including English and Mathematics) at grades A*-C was 33.7%, compared to 60.7% for non-eligible students (as at the first-round Summer 2014 results); with lower relative attainment by 27 percent of such students.  It added the gap widened by 0.3% since 2013.&lt;ref name="tes"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.tes.co.uk/b/news/2015/02/04/pupil-premium-39-has-failed-to-close-attainment-gap-39-research-reveals.aspx|title=Pupil premium 'has failed to close attainment gap', thinktank claims|first=Stephen|last=Exley|work=Times Educational Supplement|date=4 February 2015|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This follows a similar widening in its previous report. However it noted in the same period overall attainment has increased significantly.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jan/28/pupil-premium-gcse-attainment-gap|title=Pupil premium struggling to close GCSE attainment gap |first=Nicholas|last=Watt|date=28 January 2014|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Department for Education]] has disputed Demos' analysis, its spokesman stating: "It is nonsense to say that the attainment gap is widening. The 2014 results – when analysed with our more informative and accurate measure – show the gap has narrowed by almost 4 per cent since 2012, the year after the pupil premium was introduced."&lt;ref name="tes" /&gt; The [[Sutton Trust]] reviewed the impact of the introduction of the pupil premium in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.suttontrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Pupil-Premium-Summit-Report-FINAL-EDIT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rasammah Bhupalan''' (born 1 May 1927), also known as '''Rasammah Naomi Navarednam''' or '''Mrs F.R. Bhupalan''', is a Malaysian freedom fighter and social activist.

She has championed causes such as the anti-drug abuse movement, women's rights, education and social justice causes.

==Pre-Independence==
Rasammah was one of the earliest women involved in the fight for [[Malaysia]]n (then [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]]) independence. She joined the [[Rani of Jhansi Regiment]], the women's wing of the [[Indian National Army]], to fight the British.&lt;ref&gt;Looking East to Look West: Lee Kuan Yew's Mission India By Sunanda K. Datta-Ray, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; She served in [[Burma]] during [[World War II]].

==Women's Rights==
As founder president of the Women Teacher's Union, she fought for [[equal pay for women]] teachers and tried to bring disparate teachers' unions under an umbrella.

The former school principal was the first Asian representative of the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession for two successive terms. She was also very active in the National Council of Women's Organisation (NCWO) and Pemadam.

==Recognition==
Bhupalan was a teacher in the Methodist Boys School Kuala Lumpur (MBSSKL) from 1959 to 1964 and was the principal of Methodist Girls School Kuala Lumpur (MGSKL) for 14 years from 1969 until she retired in 1982. On 11 November 2007, Mrs.Bhupalan was among the few veteran teachers who were honored at MBSSKL's 110th Anniversary Celebration Dinner. The dinner was specially organized to honour all the former and current teachers of the school.

On 21 November 2006, a book entitled ''Footprints on The Sands of Time, Rasammah Bhupalan: A Life of Purpose'' authored by Associate Professor Dr Aruna Gopinath was launched by Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Datuk Dr [[Rais Yatim]].
 
The biography, published with the support of the National Archives, the ministry and NCWO, is about the life of Rasammah seen in a historical context.

'''School refusal''' is the refusal to attend school due to emotional [[distress (medicine)|distress]]. School refusal differs from [[truancy]] in that children with school refusal feel anxiety or fear towards school, whereas truant children generally have no feelings of fear towards school, often feeling angry or bored with it instead.  Children's Hospital Boston provides a chart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site1562/mainpageS1562P0.html |title=School Refusal approach at CHB |publisher=Childrenshospital.org |accessdate=2012-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing the difference between school refusal and truancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Children’s Hospital Boston|title=School Refusal|url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site1562/mainpageS1562P0.html|accessdate=2012-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''school refusal'' was coined to reflect that children have problems attending school for a variety of different reasons and these reasons might not be the expression of a true phobia{{Definition needed|date=January 2018}}, such as separation or social anxiety.&lt;ref name=Wimmer&gt;{{cite web|author=Wimmer, M.|title=School refusal: Information for educators|publisher=National Association of School Psychologists|url=http://www.nasponline.org/families/schoolrefusal.pdf|accessdate=2012-10-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211071449/http://www.nasponline.org/families/schoolrefusal.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of school refusal include the child saying they feel sick often or waking up with a headache, stomachache, or sore throat.  If the child stays home from school, these symptoms might go away but come back the next morning before school.  Additionally, children with school refusal may have crying spells or throw temper tantrums.&lt;ref name=AAFP /&gt;

Warning signs of school refusal include frequent complaints about attending school, frequent tardiness or unexcused absences, absences on significant days (tests, speeches, physical education class), frequent requests to call or go home, excessive worrying about a parent when in school, frequent requests to go to the nurse’s office because of physical complaints, and crying about wanting to go home.&lt;ref name=Wimmer /&gt;

If a parent wishes to keep their child in school, they must correct the problem quickly; the longer a child stays out of school, the harder it will be to return.&lt;ref name=AAFP /&gt; However, it may be hard to accomplish as when forced they are prone to [[temper tantrums]], crying spells, [[psychosomatic]] or [[panic]] symptoms and threats of self-harm. These problems quickly fade if the child is allowed to stay home.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Although school refusal is not a clinical disorder according to the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', Fourth Edition, it can be associated with several psychiatric disorders, including [[Separation Anxiety Disorder]], [[Social Phobia]], and [[Conduct Disorder]].&lt;ref name=Setzer /&gt; Therefore it is critical that youths who are school refusing receive a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Anxiety Disorders of America|title=School Refusal|url=http://www.adaa.org/living-with-anxiety/children/school-refusal|accessdate=2012-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Whereas some cases of school refusal can be resolved by gradual re-introduction to the school environment, some others may need to be treated with some form of [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]] or [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behaviour therapy]]. Some families have sought [[alternative education]] for school refusers which has also proved to be effective. In extreme cases, some form of medication is sometimes prescribed but none of these have stood out prominently as solutions to the problem.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

A medical condition often mistaken for school refusal is [[delayed sleep phase syndrome]] (DSPS). DSPS is a [[circadian rhythm sleep disorder]] which is characterized by a chronic delayed sleep cycle.

The attempt to control by means of threats or pressure, the behavior of the student, is also still in danger as external (extrinsic) motivation to undermine intrinsic motivation and a sense of self-control, self-worth and self-responsibility. Some social scientists and evaluators view the condition as a pseudophobia.&lt;ref&gt;Trueman, David. "What are the characteristics of school phobic children?." Psychological Reports 54.1 (1984): 191-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Factors that can cause reluctance to attend school can be divided into four categories. These categories have been developed based on studies in the United States under the leadership of Professor Christopher Kearney. Some students may be affected by several factors at once.

* The child might want to be free{{Explanation needed|date=January 2018}}.
* The child possibly wants to avoid school-related issues and situations that cause them to experience unpleasant feelings, such as anxiety, depression, or psychosomatic symptoms. The reluctance to attend school is one symptom that can indicate the presence of a larger issue, such as anxiety disorder, depression, learning disability, sleep disorder, separation anxiety or panic disorder.
* The child may want to avoid tests, presentations, group work, specific lessons, or interaction with other children.  The child should be assessed for learning disabilities if academic performance is average or low.
* The child may want attention from significant people outside of school, such as parents or older acquaintances.
* The child possibly wants to do something more enjoyable outside of school, like practice hobbies, play computer games, watch movies, play with friends such as riding bikes, etc., or learn [[autodidacticism|autodidactictally]].&lt;ref name = Kearney&gt;Kearney, Christopher A. (2001). School refusal behavior in youth: A functional approach to assessment and treatment. (pp. 3–24). xiii, 265 pp. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association; US.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors can be:
* Anxiety about [[academic achievement]] and [[Test anxiety|being tested]] can arise on the basis of inflated claims by teachers and/or parents, but also unrealistic ambitions of the upset child themselves.
* School refusal may arise as a response to [[bullying]] or [[Social rejection|peer rejection]].
* [[Shyness]] or a [[social phobia]] can contribute to school refusal.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
* The child might worry about parents or siblings, for instance, a parent with substance abuse, or a parent who physically abuses other family members.&lt;ref name = Kearney/&gt;
* Some students may refuse to go to school due to anxiety or fears of emergency drills, such as [[fire drill|fire]], [[lockdown drill|lockdown]], and [[Tornado drill|tornado]] drills.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Diagnosis==
Certain children who are particularly attached to their mother or other family figure due to [[separation anxiety disorder|separation anxiety]] and/or [[attachment theory]] often suffer the onset early, in pre-school, [[Day care|crèche]] or before school starts.

School phobia is diagnosed primarily through questionnaires and interviews with doctors. Other methods like observation have not proven to be as useful. This is partly because (school) anxiety is an internal phenomenon.  An example of a modern multidimensional questionnaire is the "Differential Power Anxiety Inventory 'approach, with twelve scales to diagnose four different areas: anxiety-inducing conditions, manifestations, coping strategies and stabilization forms."

==Epidemiology==
Approximately 1 to 5% of school-aged children have school refusal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fremont, W. P.|year=2003|title=School refusal in children and adolescents|publisher=American Family Physician, 68(8), 1555–1561|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2003/1015/p1555.html#afp20031015p1555-t1|accessdate=2012-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is most common in 5- and 6-year olds and in 10- and 11-year olds,&lt;ref name=AAFP /&gt;  it occurs more frequently during major changes in a child’s life, such as entrance to kindergarten, changing from elementary to middle school, or changing from middle to high school.&lt;ref name=Wimmer /&gt;  The problem may start following vacations, [[school holidays]], [[summer vacation]], or brief illness, after the child has been home for some time, and usually ends prior to vacations, [[school holidays]], or [[summer vacation]], before the child will be out of school for some time.   School refusal can also occur after a stressful event, such as moving to a new house, or the death of a pet or relative.&lt;ref name=AAFP&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Academy of Family Physicians|year=2003|title=Information from your family doctor: What to do when your child refuses to go to school|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2003/1015/p1563.html|accessdate=2012-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate is similar within both genders,&lt;ref name=AAFP /&gt; and although it is significantly more prevalent in some urban areas, there are no known socioeconomic differences.&lt;ref name=Setzer&gt;{{cite web|author=Setzer, N., &amp; Salzhauer, A|year=2001|title=Understanding school refusal|publisher=New York University Child Study Center|url=http://www.aboutourkids.org/articles/understanding_school_refusal|accessdate=2012-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Student activism''' is work by students to cause political, environmental, economic, or social change. Although often focused on schools, curriculum, and educational funding, student groups have influenced greater political events.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2005) [http://www.commonaction.org/SocialChangeGuide.pdf ''Guide to Social Change Led By and With Young People''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929122915/http://www.commonaction.org/SocialChangeGuide.pdf |date=2011-09-29 }} Olympia, WA: CommonAction.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern student activist movements vary widely in subject, size, and success, with all kinds of students in all kinds of educational settings participating, including public and private school students; elementary, middle, senior, undergraduate, and graduate students; and all races, socio-economic backgrounds, and political perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2006)[http://www.commonaction.org/publications.htm ''Washington Youth Voice Handbook''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231034446/http://www.commonaction.org/publications.htm |date=2006-12-31 }} Olympia, WA: CommonAction.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[student protests]] focus on the internal affairs of a specific institution; others focus on broader issues such as a war or [[dictatorship]]. Likewise, some student protests focus on an institution's impact on the world, such as a [[disinvestment]] campaign, while others may focus on a regional or national policy's impact on the institution, such as a campaign against government education policy.  Although student activism is commonly associated with [[left-wing]] politics, right-wing student movements are not uncommon; for example, large student movements fought on both sides of the [[apartheid]] struggle in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Student Resistance: A History of the Unruly Subject|page=261|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1135206457|isbn=1135206457|first=Mark Edelman|last=Boren|year=2013|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student activism at the university level is nearly as old as the [[university]] itself. Students in Paris and Bologna staged collective actions as early as the 13th century, chiefly over [[town and gown]] issues.{{sfn|Boren|2013|pp=9-10}} Student protests over broader political issues also have a long pedigree.  In [[Joseon Dynasty]] Korea, 150 [[Sungkyunkwan]] students staged an unprecedented remonstration against the king in 1519 over the [[Korean literati purges|Kimyo purge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|language=Korean|title=기묘사화 : 핏빛 조선 4대 사화 세 번째 [Gimyosahwa: pitbit joseon 4dae sahwa se beonjjae / The Kimyo purge: third of bloody Joseon's four great literati purges]|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=8994125124|author=한국인물사연구원 |isbn=8994125124|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

===Argentina===
[[File:Reforma Universitaria.jpg|thumb|Students raise the flag of Argentina at the [[National University of Córdoba|University of Córdoba]], 1918.]]
In [[Argentina]], as elsewhere in [[Latin America]], the tradition of student activism dates back to at least the 19th century, but it was not until after 1900 that it became a major political force.{{sfn|Boren|2013|p=68}} in 1918 student activism triggered a general modernization of the universities especially tending towards democratization, called the [[University Revolution]] (Spanish: ''revolución universitaria'').{{sfn|Boren|2013|p=71}} The events started in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and were accompanied by similar uprisings across Latin America.{{sfn|Boren|2013|p=68}}

===Australia===
&lt;!-- [[File:Student Protest. University of Melbourne.jpg|thumb|Students Protesting against Education Cuts. [[University of Melbourne]], Parkville Campus]] --&gt;
Australian Students have a long history of being active in political debates. This is particularly true in the newer universities that have been established in suburban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flindersstudents.com/news/content/view/37/35/|title=Book review: It Can't Happen Here|publisher=FlindersStudents|accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of the 20th century, the major campus organizing group across Australia was the [[Australian Union of Students]], which was founded in 1937 as the Union of Australian University Students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Radical Students: The Old Left at Sydney University

===Bangladesh===
{{Main|Student politics of Bangladesh}}

Student politics of Bangladesh is reactive, confrontational and violent. Student organizations act as the armament of the political parties they are part of.  Over the years, political clashes and factional feuds in the educational institutes killed many, seriously hampering the academic atmosphere. To check those hitches, universities have no options but go to lengthy and unexpected closures. Therefore, classes are not completed on time and there are session jams.

The student wings of ruling parties dominate the campuses and residential halls through crime and violence to enjoy various unauthorized facilities. They control the residential halls to manage seats in favor of their party members and loyal pupils. They eat and buy for free from the restaurants and shops nearby. They extort and grab tenders to earn illicit money. They take money from the freshmen candidates and put pressure on teachers to get an acceptance for them. They take money from the job seekers and put pressures on university administrations to appoint them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Canada===
[[File:Protest-Montreal-22-May-2012.jpg|thumb|Students protest against [[Bill 78 (Quebec, 2012)|Bill 78]] in Montreal, 2012.]]
In [[Canada]], [[New Left]] student organizations from the late 1950s and 1960s became mainly two: SUPA ([[Student Union for Peace Action]]) and CYC (Company of Young Canadians). SUPA grew out of the CUCND (Combined Universities Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) in December 1964, at a University of Saskatchewan conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sixties in Canada: A Turbulent and Creative Decade|page=59 https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1551643316|isbn=1551643316
|first=M. Athena |last=Palaeologu|year=2009|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; While CUCND had focused on protest marches, SUPA sought to change Canadian society as a whole.{{sfn|Palaeologu|2009|p=59}} The scope expanded to grass-roots politics in disadvantaged communities and 'consciousness raising' to radicalize and raise awareness of the 'generation gap' experienced by Canadian youth. SUPA was a decentralized organization, rooted in local university campuses. SUPA however disintegrated in late 1967 over debates concerning the role of working class and 'Old Left'.{{sfn|Palaeologu|2009|p=96}} Members moved to the CYC or became active leaders in CUS (Canadian Union of Students), leading the CUS to assume the mantle of New Left student agitation.

In 1968, SDU (Students for a Democratic University) was formed at McGill and Simon Fraser Universities. SFU SDU, originally former SUPA members and New Democratic Youth, absorbed members from the campus Liberal Club and Young Socialists. SDU was prominent in an Administration occupation in 1968, and a student strike in 1969.{{sfn|Palaeologu|2009|pp=228-220}} After the failure of the student strike, SDU broke up. Some members joined the IWW and Yippies (Youth International Party). Other members helped form the Vancouver Liberation Front in 1970. The [[FLQ]] (Quebec Liberation Front) was considered a terrorist organization, causing the use of the [[War Measures Act]] after 95 bombings in the [[October Crisis]]. This was the only peacetime use of the War Measures Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canada's Rights Revolution: Social Movements and Social Change, 1937-82

|first=Dominique |last=Clement|year=2009|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, PIRGs ([[Public Interest Research Groups]]) have been created as a result of Student Union referendums across Canada in individual provinces. Like their American counterparts, Canadian PIRGs are student directed, run, and funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gzZXiLubV9QC&amp;pg=PA326|title=The Ralph Nader Reader|last=Nader|first=Ralph|year=2000|isbn=9781583220573|page=326|chapter=Introduction to ''More Action for a Change''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most operate on a [[consensus decision making]] model. Despite efforts at collaboration, Canadian PIRGs are independent of each other.

[[Anti-Bullying Day]] (a.k.a.

In 2012, the [[2012 Quebec student protests|Quebec Student Movement]] arose due to an increase of tuition of 75%; that took students out of class and into the streets because that increase did not allow students to comfortably extend their education, because of fear of debt or not having money at all. Following elections that year, premier [[Jean Charest]] promised to repeal anti-assembly laws and cancel the tuition hike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|magazine=The Nation|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/170068/did-quebecs-election-end-student-movement|title=Did Quebec's Election End the Student Movement? |first=Zachary|last=Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La educación no se vende.jpg|thumb|Chilean students demonstrate for greater public involvement in education.]]
From 2011 to 2013, Chile was rocked by a series of [[student voice|student-led]] nationwide protests across [[Chile]], demanding a new framework for [[education in Chile|education in the country]], including more direct state participation in secondary education and an end to the existence of profit in higher education. Currently in Chile, only 45% of high school students study in traditional public schools and most universities are also private. No new public universities have been built since the end of the [[Chilean transition to democracy]] in 1990, even though the number of university students has swelled. Beyond the specific demands regarding education, the protests reflected a "deep discontent" among some parts of society with Chile's [[List of countries by income inequality|high level of inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Long|first=Gideon|title=Chile student protests point to deep discontent|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-14487555|accessdate=August 14, 2011|newspaper=BBC News |date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests have included massive non-violent marches, but also a considerable amount of violence on the part of a side of protestors as well as riot police.

The first clear government response to the protests was a proposal for a new education fund&lt;ref name=GANE&gt;[http://www.gob.cl/destacados/2011/07/05/cadena-nacional-de-radio-y-television-presidente-pinera-anuncio-gran-acuerdo-nacional-por-la-educaci.htm Cadena Nacional de Radio y Televisión: Presidente Piñera anunció Gran Acuerdo Nacional por la Educación] Government of Chile.

===China===
[[File:Beijing students protesting the Treaty of Versailles (May 4, 1919).jpg|thumb|Students from the [[Peking University]] protesting on Tiananmen Square in 1919]]

Since the defeat of the [[Qing Dynasty]] during the [[First Opium War|First]] (1839–1842) and [[Second Opium War]]s (1856–1860), student activism has played a significant role in the modern Chinese history.&lt;ref name=zhang&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Fueled mostly by [[Chinese nationalism]], Chinese student activism strongly believes that young people are responsible for China's future.&lt;ref name=zhang/&gt; This strong nationalistic belief has been able to manifest in several forms such as [[Democracy]], [[anti-Americanism]] and [[Communism]].&lt;ref name=zhang/&gt;

One of the most important acts of student activism in Chinese history is the 1919 [[May Fourth Movement]] that saw over 3,000 students of [[Peking University]] and other schools gathered together in front of [[Tiananmen]] and holding a demonstration. It is regarded as an essential step of the democratic revolution in China, and it had also give birth to Chinese Communism. Anti-Americanism movements led by the students during the [[Chinese Civil War]] were also instrumental in discrediting the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] government and bring the Communist victory in China.&lt;ref name=zhang/&gt; In 1989, the democracy movement led by the students at the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] ended in a brutal government crackdown which would later be called a massacre.

=== Democratic Republic of the Congo ===
Student activism played an important, yet understudied, role in Congo’s crisis of decolonisation. Throughout the 1960s, students denounced the unfinished decolonisation of higher education and the unrealised promises of national independence.  The two issues crossed in the demonstration of June 4th, 1969. Student activism continues and women such as Aline Mukovi Neema&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHiMz4DqPTQ|title=Wajenzi - Interview with Aline Mukovi Neema|last=|first=|date=25 June 2015|website=Youtube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, winner of 100 Women BBC award, continue to campaign for political change in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

===Eastern Europe and the post-Soviet Union states===
[[File:Mjaft! Protest3.jpg|thumb|MJAFT! protest in Albania]]
During communist rule, students in [[Eastern Europe]] were the force behind several of the best-known instances of protest. The chain of events leading to the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] was started by peaceful student demonstrations in the streets of [[Budapest]], later attracting workers and other Hungarians. In [[Czechoslovakia]], one of the most known faces of the protests following the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-led invasion that ended the [[Prague Spring]] was [[Jan Palach]], a student who committed [[suicide]] by setting fire to himself on January 16, 1969. The act triggered a major protest against the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/czechs-remember-prague-spring-protestors-suicide-burning/a-3950695|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=2009-01-16|title=Czechs Remember Prague Spring Protestor's Suicide Burning|accessdate=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student-dominated youth movements have also played a central role in the "[[color revolutions]]" seen in post-communist societies in recent years. The first example of this was the [[Serbia]]n [[Otpor!]] ("Resistance!" in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]), formed in October 1998 as a response to repressive university and media laws that were introduced that year. In the presidential campaign in September 2000, the organisation engineered the "Gotov je" ("He's finished") campaign that galvanized Serbian discontent with [[Slobodan Milošević]], ultimately resulting in his defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Join the Club: How Peer Pressure Can Transform the World

|first=Tina |last=Rosenberg|year=2011 |pages=270–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otpor has inspired other youth movements in [[Eastern Europe]], such as [[Kmara]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], which played an important role in the [[Rose Revolution]], and [[Pora]] in [[Ukraine]], which was key in organising the demonstrations that led to the [[Orange Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Color Revolutions|page=69

Similar movements include [[KelKel]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Zubr (political organization)|Zubr]] in [[Belarus]] and [[MJAFT!]] in [[Albania]].

Opponents of the "color revolutions" have accused the [[Soros Foundation]]s and/or the [[United States]] government of supporting and even planning the revolutions in order to serve western interests.{{sfn|Mitchell|2012|pp=81-86}} Supporters of the revolutions have argued that these allegations are greatly exaggerated, and that the revolutions were positive events, morally justified, whether or not Western support had an influence on the events.

===France===
[[File:University of Lyon Law School with graffiti June 1968.jpg|thumb|Occupation of the [[University of Lyon]] Law School, 1968]]
In [[France]], student activists have been influential in shaping public debate. In [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] the [[University of Paris]] at [[Nanterre]] was closed due to problems between the students and the administration.{{sfn|Boren|2013|p=149-150}} In protest of the closure and the expulsion of Nanterre students, students of the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]] began their own demonstration.{{sfn|Boren|2013|p=151}} The situation escalated into a nationwide [[insurrection]].

The events in Paris were followed by student protests throughout the world. The [[German student movement]] participated in major demonstrations against proposed [[German Emergency Acts|emergency legislation]]. In many countries, the student protests caused authorities to respond with violence. In [[Spain]], student demonstrations against [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] dictatorship led to clashes with police. A student demonstration in [[Mexico City]] ended in a storm of bullets on the night of October 2, 1968, an event known as the [[Tlatelolco massacre]]. Even in [[Pakistan]], students took to the streets to protest changes in education policy, and on November 7 two college students died after police opened fire on a demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxist.com/pakistans-other-story-6.htm|title= Pakistan’s Other Story: 6.

===Germany===

[[File:Wartburg-Studentenzug-1817.jpg|thumb|Procession of students at Wartburg Festival]]
In 1815 in [[Jena]] ([[Germany]]) the [[Burschenschaft|"Urburschenschaft"]] was founded. That was a [[Studentenverbindung]] that was concentrated on national and democratic ideas.
In 1817, inspired by liberal and patriotic ideas of a united Germany, student organisations gathered for the [[Wartburg festival]] at [[Wartburg Castle]], at [[Eisenach]] in [[Thuringia]], on the occasion of which reactionary books were burnt.

In 1819 the student [[Karl Ludwig Sand]] murdered the writer [[August Friedrich Ferdinand von Kotzebue|August von Kotzebue]], who had scoffed at liberal student organisations.

In May 1832 the [[Hambacher Fest]] was celebrated at [[Hambach Castle]] near [[Neustadt an der Weinstraße]] with about 30 000 participants, amongst them many students. Together with the [[Frankfurter Wachensturm]] in 1833 planned to free students held in prison at Frankfurt and [[Georg Büchner]]'s revolutionary [[pamphlet]] ''Der Hessische Landbote'' that were events that led to [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|the revolutions in the German states in 1848]].

In the 1960s, the worldwide upswing in student and youth radicalism manifested itself through the [[German student movement]] and organisations such as the [[German Socialist Student Union]]. The movement in Germany shared many concerns of similar groups elsewhere, such as the democratisation of society and opposing the [[Vietnam War]], but also stressed more nationally specific issues such as coming to terms with the legacy of the [[Nazi]] regime and opposing the [[German Emergency Acts]].

In 1928, the Youth Pledge ([[Sumpah Pemuda]]) helped to during Rouhani’s first term in office (2013–2017)give voice to [[anti-colonial]] sentiments.

During the political turmoil of the 1960s, right-wing student groups staged demonstrations calling for then-President [[Sukarno]] to eliminate alleged [[Communist]]s from his government, and later demanding that he resign.{{sfn|Boren|2013|pp=127-128}}  Sukarno did step down in 1967, and was replaced by Army general [[Suharto]].{{sfn|Boren|2013|p=128}}

In [[Iran]], students have been at the forefront of protests both against the pre-1979 secular monarchy and, in recent years, against the theocratic [[islamic republic]]. Both religious and more moderate students played a major part in [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]'s opposition network against the [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]].{{sfn|Boren|2013|p=198-199}} In January 1978 the army dispersed demonstrating students and religious leaders, killing several students and sparking a series of widespread protests that ultimately led to the [[Iranian Revolution]] the following year. On November 4, 1979, militant Iranian students calling themselves the Muslim Students Following the Line of the Imam seized the [[United States of America|U.S.]] embassy in [[Tehran]] holding 52 embassy employees hostage for a 444 days (see [[Iran hostage crisis]]).

Recent years have seen several incidents when liberal students have clashed with the Iranian government, most notably the [[Iran student riots, July 1999|Iranian student riots of July 1999]]. Several people were killed in a week of violent confrontations that started with a police raid on a university dormitory, a response to demonstrations by a group of students of [[Tehran University]] against the closure of a reformist newspaper. [[Akbar Mohammadi (student)|Akbar Mohammadi]] was given a [[capital punishment|death sentence]], later reduced to 15 years in prison, for his role in the protests.

At the end of 2002, students held mass demonstrations protesting the death sentence of reformist lecturer [[Hashem Aghajari]] for alleged blasphemy. In June 2003, several thousand students took to the streets of Tehran in anti-government protests sparked by government plans to privatise some universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2980102.stm|title= Iranians protest against clerics|publisher=[[BBC]]|date= 2003-06-11|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese student movement began during the [[Taishō Democracy]], and grew in activity after World War II. They were mostly carried out by activist students. One such event was the Anpo opposition movement, which occurred in 1960, in opposition to the [[Anpo]] treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japan's New Left Movements: Legacies for Civil Society |page=30

===Malaysia===
Since the amendment of Section 15 of the Universities and University Colleges Act 1971 (UUCA) in 1975, students were barred from being members of, and expressing support or opposition to, any political parties or "any organization, body or group of persons which the Minister, after consultation with the Board, has specified in writing to the Vice-Chancellor to be unsuitable to the interests and well-being of the students or the University." However, in October 2011, the Court of Appeal ruled that the relevant provision in Section 15 UUCA was unconstitutional due to Article 10 of the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Federal Constitution]] pertaining to [[freedom of expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/international/malaysia-rules-against-ban-on-student-politics/475393|title=Malaysia Rules Against Ban on Student Politics|date=31 October 2011|work=Jakarta Globe|accessdate=25 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308220621/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/international/malaysia-rules-against-ban-on-student-politics/475393|archivedate=8 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the act prohibiting students from expressing "support, sympathy or opposition" to any political party was enacted in 1971, Malaysian students have repeatedly demanded that the ban on political involvement be rescinded. The majority of students are not interested in politics because they are afraid that the universities will take action against them. The UUCA (also known by its Malaysian acronym AUKU) not however been entirely successful in eliminating student activism and political engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islam, Politics and Youth in Malaysia|page=98

In Kuala Lumpur on 14 April 2012, student activists camped out at Independence Square and marched against a government loan program that they said charged students high interest rates and left them with debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Green Left Weekly|title=Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur Occupy camp ambushed by thugs|date=2012-04-19|first=Temme|last=Lee|url=https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/50731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest student movement in Malaysia is the Solidariti Mahasiswa Malaysia (SMM; Student Solidarity of Malaysia). This is a coalition group that represents numerous student organizations.{{sfn|Mueller|2014|p=98}} Currently, SMM is actively campaigning against the UUCA and a free education at primary, secondary and tertiary level.

===México===
[[File:MarchaYoSoy132.jpg|thumb|A Yo Soy 132 march, 2012]]
During the [[protests of 1968]], [[México|Mexican]] government killed an estimated 30 to 300 students and civilian protesters. This killing is known as in the [[Tlatelolco massacre]]. killing of an estimated 30 to 300 students and civilians by military and police on October 2, 1968, in the [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]] in the [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]] section of [[Mexico City]]. The events are considered part of the Mexican [[Dirty War (Mexico)|Dirty War]], when the government used its forces to suppress political opposition. The massacre occurred 10 days before the opening of the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in Mexico City.{{sfn|Boren|2013|pp=170-171}}
 
More recent student movements include [[Yo Soy 132]] in 2012. Yo Soy 132 was a [[social movement]] composed for the most part of Mexican university students from private and public universities, residents of Mexico, claiming supporters from about 50 cities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=315804|title=#YoSoy132 presume contar con 52 asambleas internacionales|date=1 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It began as opposition to the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) candidate [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] and the Mexican media's allegedly biased coverage of the 2012 general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/101333/youth-protest-former-mexican-ruling-partys-rise |title=Youth protest former Mexican ruling party's rise |work=[[Buenos Aires Herald]] |publisher=Editorial Amfin S.A. |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Yo Soy 132, Spanish for "I Am 132", originated in an expression of solidarity with the original 131 protest's initiators.

===Philippines===
Student activism in the Philippines started by the time of Marcos regime in the late 1960s or early 1970s during the so-called First Quarter Storm of Martial Law. Until today, student activism continues for various causes such as for free education, corruption within the government, and extrajudicial killings. Some groups that lead these protests are the League of Filipino Students (LFS), National Union of Students of the Philippines (NUSP), Anakpawis, and Kabataan Party-List.

Student political activism has existed in U.K since the 1880s with the formation of the [[student representative council]]s, precursors of union organisations designed to present students interests. These later evolved into unions, many of which became part of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] formed in 1921. However, the NUS was designed to be specifically outside of "political and religious interests", reducing its importance as a centre for student activism. During the 1930s students began to become more politically involved with the formation of many socialist societies at universities, ranging from social democratic to Marxist–Leninist and Trotskyite, even leading to [[Brian Simon]], a communist, becoming head of the NUS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Measuring the Mind: Education and Psychology in England c.1860-c.1990|page=296

|first=Adrian |last=Wooldridge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was not until the 1960s that student activism became important in British universities. Here, like many other countries, the Vietnam war and issues of racism became a focus for many other local frustrations, such as fees and student representation. In 1962, the first student protest against the Vietnam War was held, with [[CND]]. However, student activism did not begin on a large scale until the mid-1960s. In 1965, a student protest of 250 students was held outside [[Edinburgh]]'s American embassy and the beginning of protests against the Vietnam war in [[Embassy of the United States in London|Grovesnor square]]. It also saw the first major teach-in in Britain in 1965, where students debated the [[Vietnam War]] and alternative non-violent means of protest at the [[London School of Economics]], sponsored by the [[Oxford Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3TJ2TKBq-sC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;|page=98|title=Britain, America, and the Vietnam War|first= Sylvia|last= Ellis|isbn=9780275973810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 the [[Radical Student Alliance]] and [[Vietnam Solidarity Campaign]] were formed, both of which became centres for the protest movement. However, the first student sit-in was held at the London School of Economics in 1967 by their Student's Union over the suspension of two students. Its success and a national student rally of 100,000 held in the same year is usually considered to mark the start of the movement. Up until the mid-1970s student activities were held including a protest of up to 80,000 strong in [[Grosvenor Square]], anti-racist protests and occupations in Newcastle, the breaking down of riot control gates and forced closure of the London School of Economics, and [[Jack Straw]] becoming the head of the NUS for the RSA.  However, many protests were over more local issues, such as student representation in college governance,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P. H. J. (2007)[http://www.patricksmith.org.uk/ ''Student revolution in 1960s Britain: Myth or reality?''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114030518/http://www.patricksmith.org.uk/ |date=2009-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; better accommodation, lower fees or even canteen prices.

Student protests erupted again in 2010 during the [[Premiership of David Cameron]] over the issue of [[Tuition fees (UK)|tuition fees]], higher education funding cuts and withdrawal of the Education Maintenance Allowance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11877034 | work=BBC News | title=Student tuition fee protest ends with 153 arrests | date=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Vietnamdem.jpg|thumb|A US demonstration against the [[Vietnam War]], 1967]]
In the [[United States]], student activism is often understood as a form of [[youth activism]] that can be oriented toward change in the [[Education in the United States|American educational system]], civil rights, law enforcement, nuclear weapons, to a wide range of issues. Student activism in the United States dates to the beginning of public education, if not before. Some of the first well documented, directed activism occurred on the campuses of black institutions like Fisk and Howard in the 1920s. At Fisk, student's concerns surrounding disciplinary rules designed to undermine black identity coalesced into demands for the resignation of President [[Fayette Avery McKenzie]]. Spurred by alum [[W.E.B. Du Bois]]' 1924 commencement speech, the students ignored the 10p.m. curfew to protest, and staged subsequent walkouts. After a committee formed to investigate the protests ruled unfavorably on Mckenzie's abilities and handling of the unrest, he resigned on April 16, 1925. Events at Fisk had wide repercussions, as black students elsewhere began to question the repressive status quo of the postwar black university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Negro on Campus: Black College Rebellions of the 1920s|pages=29–69|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=069104628X|isbn=069104628X|first=Raymond|last=Wolters|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next wave of activism was spurred by Depression-era realities of the 1930s. The [[American Youth Congress]] was a student-led organization in Washington, DC, which lobbied the US Congress against war and racial discrimination and for youth programs. It was heavily supported by First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].{{sfn|Boren|2013|p=96}}

The [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] era of the 1960s and early 1970s saw several waves of student activists gaining increasing political prominence in American society. Students formed social movements that moved them from resistance to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Flacks, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; An early important national student group was the Student's Peace Union, established in 1959.{{sfn|Boren|2013|p=114}} Another highlight of this period was [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) launched in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], was a student-led organization that focused on schools as a social agent that simultaneously oppresses and potentially uplifts society. SDS eventually spun off the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]]. Another successful group was [[Ann Arbor]] Youth Liberation, which featured students calling for an end to state-led education. Also notable were the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] and the [[Atlanta Student Movement]], predominantly African American groups that fought against racism and for integration of public schools across the US. The [[Free Speech Movement]] in 1964-65 at UC Berkeley used mass civil disobedience to overturn restrictions on on-campus political activities.

The [[Third World Liberation Front Strikes of 1968|longest student strike]] in American history started on November 6, 1968, and lasted until March 21, 1969, at San Francisco State College to raise awareness of third-world student access to higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacesfsu1967.com/aboutus|title=Philippine American Collegiate Endeavor|accessdate=21 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World_Liberation_Front_strikes_of_1968|title=Third World Liberation Front strikes of 1968|accessdate=21 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}

The [[Student Strike of 1970|largest student strike]] in American history took place in May and June 1970, in response to the [[Kent State shootings]] and the American [[Cambodian Campaign|invasion of Cambodia]]. Over four million students participated in this action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The '60s Experience: Hard Lessons about Modern America|page=164|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1566390141|isbn=1566390141|first=Edward P.|last=Morgan |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American society saw an increase in student activism again in the 1990s. The popular education reform movement has led to a resurgence of [[populism|populist]] student activism against standardized testing and teaching,&lt;ref&gt;HoSang, D. (2003). [http://www.fcyo.org/Papers_no2_v4.qxd.pdf ''Youth and Community Organizing Today''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917174626/http://www.fcyo.org/Papers_no2_v4.qxd.pdf |date=2009-09-17 }} New York: Funders Collaborative on Youth Organizing.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more complex issues including military/industrial/prison complex and the influence of the military and corporations in education&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, M. (2004) [https://web.archive.org/web/20040211183443/http://www.arc.org/Pages/pubs/youthrising.html ''Youth Rising''].&lt;/ref&gt; There is also increased emphasis on ensuring that changes that are made are sustainable, by pushing for better education funding and policy or leadership changes that engage students as decision-makers in schools. Notably, universities participated in the [[Disinvestment from South Africa]] movement; [[University of California, Berkeley]], after student activism became the first institution to disinvest completely from companies implicated in and profiting from [[apartheid]].

Major contemporary campaigns include work for funding of [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], against increased tuitions at colleges or the use of [[sweatshop|sweatshop labor]] in manufacturing school apparel (e.g. United Students Against Sweatshops), for increased student voice throughout education planning, delivery, and policy-making (e.g. The [[Roosevelt Institution]]), and to raise national and local awareness of the humanitarian consequences of the [[Darfur Conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Hamilton (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Darfur-Public-Struggle-Genocide/dp/B005GNKK9M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319947948&amp;sr=8-1 ''Fighting for Darfur: Public Action and the Struggle to Stop Genocide'', Palgrave Macmillan (2011)].&lt;/ref&gt; There is also increasing activism around the issue of global warming. Antiwar activism has also increased leading to the creation of the [[Campus Antiwar Network]] and the refounding of [[Students for a Democratic Society (2006 organization)|SDS]] in 2006.

Following the national growth of the [[Black Lives Matter]] Movement, and more intensely since the 2016 election of U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], student activism has been on the rise. [[Alt-right|Alt-Right]] [[Breitbart News|Breitbart]] senior editor [[Milo Yiannopoulos]]' tour [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] sparked protest at [[University of California, Davis]], where he was scheduled to speak alongside "Pharma Bro" [[Martin Shkreli]] and [[University of California, Berkeley]], all shutting his talks down before they started through large-scale protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/01/14/protests-derail-uc-davis-event-with-breitbarts-milo-yiannopoulos-pharma-bro-martin-shkreli/|title=Protests derail UC Davis event with Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos, ‘Pharma Bro’ Martin Shkreli|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018 after the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]], many students began to organise rallies and protests against [[gun violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/19/587089773/teens-lie-in-at-white-house-to-protest-for-stronger-gun-control|title=Teens 'Lie In' at White House to Push for Stronger Gun Control|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=February 19, 2018|date=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[2018 United States gun violence protests|huge series of protests]] including the [[March for our lives]] followed, drawing millions of protesters and notably attacking the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] as well as [[Gun laws in the United States|US gun laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= http://www.newsweek.com/march-our-lives-how-many-2-million-90-voting-district-860841|title=More than 2 million joined March for Our Lives protests in 90 percent of U.S. voting districts|date=March 26, 2018|work=Newsweek|access-date=March 26, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of student activists such as [[Emma González]] who helped lead the protests quickly garnered media attention for their action.&lt;ref name="CNNMar24-2018"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/24/us/march-for-our-lives-emma-gonzalez/index.html |last=Andone |first=Dakin |title=Emma Gonzalez stood on stage for 6 minutes - the length of the Parkland gunman's shooting spree|date=March 24, 2018 |work=[[CNN]] |accessdate=March 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plane Table surveying 2014-08-17 12-56.jpg|thumb|Students in survey camp doing "[[Plane table]] survey" during July 2014 in Haridwar, India]]
'''Survey Camp''' is an army tradition that was discontinued in the later part of twentieth century but was reinstated in 2002 across the universities of the world with a whole new structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://engineering.tamu.edu/civil/academics/survey-camp Survey camp] on the Texas A&amp;M University website&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[civil engineering]] training course for two weeks usually after completion  four semesters of [[bachelor of technology]]&lt;ref name='toro'&gt;[http://www.civil.engineering.utoronto.ca/programs/courses/cme358h1.htm Civil engineering department of University of Toronto]&lt;/ref&gt; that consists of 8 days working in the field and 6 days of map preparation in the [[computer lab]]. Experts say that survey camp provides necessary foundation for [[civil engineer]]s. Each day in the course there are at least 8 hours of working in the field. Students are divided into groups and they get out with practising [[surveying|surveyors]] and use their equipment out in the field. A camp incharge teacher appoints group leaders for each group; the leaders are responsible for all the works of his particular group and the equipment. In the computer lab, students learn [[Application software|applications]] such as [[AutoCAD]] and Carlson Survey. The students use these programs to take data collected from the field to develop [[topographic maps]] of the particular area. The basic aim of the survey camp is to know various works carried out in the industrial field by [[surveying]], which includes determining the [[topography]] of particular area with the help of survey work, map study and reconnaissance work. The methods used for surveying are [[traverse (surveying)|traversing]], [[levelling]] and [[contouring]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://knswmc.com Survey camp at Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary Park], Gurgaon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Surveying, Volume 1 by C. L. Kochher&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
The instruments used include:
* Auto Level
* [[Total station]]
* [[Theodolite]] (transit)
* [[Compass]] (prismatic and surveyor)
* [[Ranging rod]]s
* [[Tape (surveying)|Measuring Tape]]
* Levelling Staff
* [[Plane table]] and all its accessories (in case drawing is prepared with hand)
* Tripod stand (for [[optical instruments]])&lt;ref name='pun'&gt;[http://www.civilsimplified.com Surveying] by B. C. Punmia and Ashok Kumar Jain&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practicals==
The survey practicals generally performed in Survey camp are listed below:
#Simple levelling
#Fly levelling
#Trignometric levelling
#To determine and draw RL's of longitudinal and cross section of road.
#Measuring horizontal angles by Ordinary, [[Repetition method|Repetition]] and Reiteration methods
#Compass traversing
#Gale traverse
#Topographic map preparation

==Procedure==
The working rule used in survey camp is quite simple, all the groups of students are allotted different stations for survey work. For first couple of days, the students carry out traversing work to determine length of different sides of traverse and included angles between them. Coordinates of each side are also determined by formulas, '''Latitude= L×&lt;math&gt; \cos \theta\!&lt;/math&gt;''' and '''Departure= L×&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta\ &lt;/math&gt;''', where '''L''' is the length of the side and &lt;math&gt; \theta\ &lt;/math&gt; is the angle which the side makes with North or South directions (the instruments used in traversing include Total Station or Theodolite with stand, Compass with stand, ranging rods and measuring tape). Then in next step [[Reduced Level|RL]] (reduced level) of each station is determined with reference to permanent [[surveying|benchmark]] (the instruments used to determine reduced level include Auto Level with stand and Levelling Staff). Then RL of different points keeping specified spacing between them with reference to each station is determined. The points having same RL are joined to form [[contour lines]] and thus a topographic map of an area is prepared using AutoCAD or with the help of plane table survey.&lt;ref name='pun'/&gt;

==Results==
In Survey camp, students obtain extensive hands-on experience in the use of [[land surveying]] instruments and in the essentials of survey practice. Measurements of distances and angles, calculation and correction of errors are introduced. Concepts of higher order surveys and [[satellite navigation]] are reviewed and illustrated. Thus students learn surveying practically, this gives them confidence to work (with good precision and accuracy) in Industrial fields in the future.&lt;ref name="toro" /&gt;

The '''Symphony of Science''' is a music project created by [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]-based [[electronic musician]] John D. Boswell. The project seeks to "spread scientific knowledge and philosophy through musical remixes."  Boswell uses  [[pitch correction|pitch-corrected]] audio and video samples from television programs featuring popular scientists and educators. The audio and video clips are mixed into [[mashup (digital)|digital mashup]]s and scored with Boswell's original compositions. Two of Boswell's music videos, "A Glorious Dawn" and "We are All Connected", feature appearances from [[Carl Sagan]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[Bill Nye]], and [[Stephen Hawking]]. The audio and video is sampled from popular science television shows including ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'', ''[[The Universe (TV series)|The Universe]]'', ''[[The Eyes of Nye]]'', ''[[The Elegant Universe]]'', and ''[[Stephen Hawking's Universe]]''.

[[Unruly Media]], a video tracking service, first charted "A Glorious Dawn" on September 21, 2009. A month later, the video had received more than a million views and was ranked in the music category on [[YouTube]] as one of the top rated videos of all time.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  On November 9, 2009, [[Third Man Records]] released a [[7-inch]] single of "A Glorious Dawn" for the 75th anniversary of the birth of Carl Sagan.

==John D. Boswell==
Composer John Boswell had been experimenting with sampling and remixing for some time before creating his first YouTube videos. Boswell had worked with [[Auto-Tune]] in the past and thought people might be interested in hearing American astronomer Carl Sagan sing.  He first saw ''Cosmos'' in 2004 and soon after bought the set of DVDs. Boswell looked through these episodes for "profound quotes" that lacked music in the background.  Once he found these quotes, Boswell Auto-Tuned Sagan's voice and picked from the best ones.  After completing what became "A Glorious Dawn", Boswell posted the video on YouTube in September 2009 and to his surprise, the video went viral within a week.&lt;ref name="GWC"&gt;{{cite podcast |url =http://www.galacticawatercooler.com/2009/10/24/gwc-podcast-191/ |title = GWC Podcast #191 |website=Galactic Watercooler |date = 2009-10-24 |accessdate = October 25, 2009}} Interview with John Boswell.

John Boswell attended [[Gonzaga Preparatory School]]&lt;ref name="Sowa" /&gt; and graduated from college with a degree in economics. Soon after, Boswell started Colorpulse, an [[electronica]] music project, and began to focus on production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.symphonyofscience.com/about.html |title=About |last=Boswell |first=John |work=The Symphony of Science - Spreading scientific knowledge and philosophy through music |accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He released an album in 2010, titled ''Escaping the Tangle'', which included some of these productions. Boswell lives in [[Bellingham, Washington]].&lt;ref name="Sowa" /&gt;  His current music project, Symphony of Science, "aims to spread scientific knowledge and philosophy through musical remixes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/melodysheep |title=Melodysheep |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to "deliver scientific knowledge and philosophy in musical form".&lt;ref name="sos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.symphonyofscience.com |title=Spreading scientific knowledge and philosophy through music |publisher=The Symphony of Science |date= |accessdate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his first few videos, Boswell began seeking permission to use the clips he uses in his project.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In addition to Symphony of Science, Boswell is also working on a project called ''Remixes for the Soul'', which he works on, in addition to Symphony of Science, under the moniker of melodysheep.

The fourth video in the series is 4 minutes in length and was released on January 6, 2010. "The Unbroken Thread" is themed around [[biology]] and [[evolution]] rather than the cosmos, and features Carl Sagan, [[David Attenborough]], and [[Jane Goodall]].

The video uses clips from ''Cosmos'', several David Attenborough documentaries (''[[Charles Darwin and the Tree of Life]]'', ''[[The Life of Mammals]]'', ''[[The Living Planet]]'', and ''BBC Life''), ''XVIVO Scientific Animations'', ''IMAX Cosmic Voyage'', Jane Goodall's TED Talk, and a [[Guinness]] commercial.

The title comes from Sagan's ''Cosmos'', and features in the refrain:
:The secrets of evolution
:Are time and death
:There's an unbroken thread that stretches
:From those first cells to us&lt;ref name="sos" /&gt;

==Reviews==
Musician [[Carrie Brownstein]] found the idea behind Symphony of Science "quite beautiful and amazing in both its sincerity and aims". She also enjoyed the "hip-hop stylings" of the camera angle on Bill Nye while he is moving his hands around and expressing himself on "We Are All Connected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monitormix/2009/10/the_symphony_of_science.html |title=The Symphony Of Science |last=Brownstein |first=Carrie |authorlink=Carrie Brownstein |date=2009-10-20 |work= |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |accessdate=2009-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Nick Sagan]], son of Carl Sagan, was impressed with "A Glorious Dawn", giving it a favorable review and stamp of approval. Sagan writes, "John Boswell over at Colorpulse Music is a mad genius, sampling both ''Cosmos'' and Stephen Hawking's ''Universe'' series into three minutes and thirty-four seconds of pure, concentrated awesomeness... Love it, love it, love it. Dad would have loved it, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nicksagan.blogs.com/nick_sagan_online/2009/09/a-glorious-dawn.html |title=A Glorious Dawn |last=Sagan |first=Nick |authorlink=Nick Sagan |date=2009-09-25 |work= |publisher=Nick Sagan Online |accessdate=2009-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columnist Franklin Harris argues that Boswell's videos show that science can arouse the minds of artists just as much as religion and mythology have in the past. Harris calls the videos "art for the Information Age, inspired by science".&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Gap between art, science no longer so wide |last=Harris |first=Franklin |newspaper=[[The Decatur Daily]] |date=2009-10-22 |url=http://www.timesdaily.com/article/20091022/ARTICLES/910225006/1006 |publisher=Tennessee Valley Printing Company }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;
