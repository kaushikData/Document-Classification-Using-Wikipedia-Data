The '''affinity diagram''' is a business tool used to organize ideas and data. It is one of the [[Seven Management and Planning Tools]]. People have been grouping data into groups based on natural relationships for thousands of years; however, the term affinity diagram was devised by [[Jiro Kawakita]] in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;Improving Performance Through Statistical Thinking By Galen C. Britz&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes referred to as the '''KJ Method'''.

The tool is commonly used within [[project management]] and allows large numbers of ideas stemming from [[brainstorming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/affinity-diagram-kawakita-jiro-or-kj-method Affinity Diagram - Kawakita Jiro or KJ Method], Retrieved June 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; to be sorted into groups, based on their natural relationships, for review and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leanyourcompany.com/methods/Using-Affinity-Diagrams.asp Using Affinity Diagrams to make sense from brainstorming]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also frequently used in [[contextual inquiry]] as a way to organize notes and insights from field interviews. It can also be used for organizing other freeform comments, such as open-ended survey responses, support call logs, or other qualitative data.

==Process==
The affinity diagram organizes ideas with following steps:
# Record each idea on cards or notes.
# Look for ideas that seem to be related.
# Sort cards into groups until all cards have been used.

Once the cards have been sorted into groups the team may sort large clusters into subgroups for easier management and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Value: Its Measurement, Design and Management  By M. Larry Shillito&lt;/ref&gt;  Once completed, the affinity diagram may be used to create a [[Ishikawa diagram|cause and effect diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tin.nhs.uk/index.asp?pgid=1129 NHS Improvement network]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, the best results tend to be achieved when the activity is completed by a cross-functional team, including key stakeholders. The process requires becoming deeply immersed in the data, which has benefits beyond the tangible deliverables.

== Career ==
As the Executive Chairman of DMCC, Bin Sulayem has played a key role in establishing and positioning DMCC as a major commodities trade hub in the region. Under his leadership, DMCC has introduced a number of value-added products and services; including the establishment of the Dubai Diamond Exchange (DDE),&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/diamond/dubai-diamond-exchange/ |title=Dubai Diamond Exchange |website=dmcc.ae |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526225927/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/diamond/dubai-diamond-exchange/ |archivedate=May 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the only diamond exchange in the Arab World affiliated to the [[World Federation of Diamond Bourses]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfdb.com/ |title=World Federation of Diamond Bourses |website=wfdb.com |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2011-08-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718034839/http://wfdb.com/| archivedate= 18 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubai Tea Trading Centre (DTTC)&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/tea/dubai-tea-trading-centre/ |title=Dubai Tea Trading Centre |publisher=dmcc.ae |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711154915/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/tea/dubai-tea-trading-centre/ |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which offers a range of value-added facilities to the global tea trade and has contributed to the UAE becoming the world's largest re-exporter of tea;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulfmanagers.com/news-3749-it-s-my-cup-of-tea.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131009070548/http://www.gulfmanagers.com/news-3749-it-s-my-cup-of-tea.html |archivedate=2013-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; DMCC Tradeflow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/tradeflow/ |title=Tradeflow |website=dmcc.ae |accessdate=2012-10-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920054612/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/tradeflow/ |archivedate=2012-09-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a central registry of ownership for commodities stored in Dubai stimulating commodity trade by offering enforceable collateral based trade finance solutions; as well as other services, such as gold refineries, gold and diamond vaults; as well as the UAE gold bullion coins&lt;ref name="www.uaegoldbullioncoins.ae"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uaegoldbullioncoins.ae|title=UAE Gold Bullion Coins - DMCC |website=www.uaegoldbullioncoins.ae}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Visions of Dubai&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/gold/visions-of-dubai/ |title=Visions of Dubai |website=dmcc.ae |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224011445/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/gold/visions-of-dubai/ |archivedate=2011-12-24 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; gold souvenir coins.

Bin Sulayem joined DMCC in 2001 as a director, prior to the official launch of the entity in 2002, and his responsibilities included overseeing the organisation’s operations. In addition to his responsibilities as Executive Chairman Bin Sulayem also serves as the Director of Human Resources, Director of Dubai Shariah Asset Management (DSAM) and Dubai Commodity Asset Management (DCAM).&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/financialservices/asset-management/ |title=Asset management |website=dmcc.ae |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001065400/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/financialservices/asset-management/ |archivedate=October  1, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also played a leading role in reviving Dubai’s traditional pearling industry by launching the Dubai Pearl Exchange&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/pearl/dubai-pearl-exchange/ |title=Dubai Pearl Exchange |website=dmcc.ae |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327190753/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/pearl/dubai-pearl-exchange/ |archivedate=March 27, 2012 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 and conceptualizing the design of Almas Tower, the tallest commercial building in the Middle East, home to Dubai Diamond Exchange, one of the largest vaults in the UAE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/gold/dmcc-gold-vault/ |title=DMCC gold vault |website=dmcc.ae |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327190805/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/gold/dmcc-gold-vault/ |archivedate=March 27, 2012 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and DMCC headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ameinfo.com/dmccs-ahmed-bin-sulayem-announces-plans-347465 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707193032/http://www.ameinfo.com/dmccs-ahmed-bin-sulayem-announces-plans-347465 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-07 |title=DMCC's Ahmed Bin Sulayem announces plans to build world's tallest commercial tower |website=www.ameinfo.com |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, DMCC hosted the World Federation of Diamond Bourse's annual Presidents' meeting, an initiative spearheaded by Bin Sulayem. This event was the first of its kind to be held in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/diamond/news/news-details/222/ |title=Former South African President Mbeki: UAE has successfully developed into one of the major players in the diamond industry |website=dmcc.ae |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929062226/http://www.dmcc.ae/jltauthority/diamond/news/news-details/222/ |archivedate=September 29, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, on August 15, 2011, Bin Sulayem unveiled the prototype of the UAE's first gold bullion coin. The coin recognises the visionary leadership of [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan|His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], President of the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai. Designed by DMCC, the “Khalifa” coin features a portrait of His Highness [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan|Sheikh Khalifa]] on one side, and on the other, [[Burj Khalifa]], the world’s tallest tower.

Following the announcement of its first gold UAE bullion coin in August 2011, on 2 December 2011, DMCC released the first design impressions of the second UAE bullion coin as part of DMCC’s celebration of the 40th anniversary of the UAE and in recognition of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai.
Titled “Palm Jumeirah”, the gold coin features a portrait of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum on one side, and on the other, an image of the iconic Palm Jumeirah. The coin is the second in a series and follows the “Burj Khalifa” coin which was successfully launched last August, and paid tribute to His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE.&lt;ref name="www.uaegoldbullioncoins.ae"/&gt;

In June 2012, Bin Sulayem received UN accreditation to represent Western Asia on behalf of [[CIBJO]], the international jewellery confederation of national trade organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zawya.com/story/United_Nations_accreditation_for_Ahmed_bin_Sulayem-ZAWYA20120714060044/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130210004407/http://www.zawya.com/story/United_Nations_accreditation_for_Ahmed_bin_Sulayem-ZAWYA20120714060044/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-10 |title=United Nations accreditation for Ahmed bin Sulayem |website=www.zawya.com |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIBJO has been a consultative member of ECOSOC, the United Nations Economic and Social Council, since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diamonds.net/News/NewsItem.aspx?ArticleID=40588&amp;ArticleTitle=CIBJO+President+Addresses+ECOSOC+in+NY|title=CIBJO President Addresses ECOSOC in NY|website= www.diamonds.net |date=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ECOSOC is one of the largest agencies operating under the United Nations umbrella, and is a coalition involving government, civil society and the business community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Jewellery Confederation|url=http://www.cibjo.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=235&amp;Itemid=46|website=www.cibjo.org|accessdate=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, he received the [[Crowe Horwath]] Award for 'Government Personality of the Year.&lt;ref name="mubasher"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.mubasher.info/DFM/news/2347757/Bin-Sulayem-receives-Horwath-Mak-Award-for-Government-Personality-of-the-Year|title=Bin Sulayem receives Horwath Mak Award for Government Personality of the Year|date=June 13, 2013 |website=english.mubasher.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was presented to Bin Sulayem for his role in the expansion of the global commodities sector; his commitment towards establishing Dubai as the global gateway to trade; [[Dubai Multi Commodities Centre|DMCC’s]] contribution to Dubai’s economy through the over 7,400 companies operating from its free zone; his efforts in developing Dubai’s Islamic Finance sector through pioneering products and services; and his social and philanthropic work focused on society, culture and heritage.

Also in June 2013, Bin Sulayem became recognised as a prominent fan of the [[LA Lakers]] due to the full page advertisement he took out in the [[LA Times]] paying tribute to [[Kobe Bryant]]. The ad thanked [[Kobe Bryant]] for his contributions to the [[LA Lakers]] and wished him a speedy recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lakersnation.com/fan-takes-out-full-page-l-a-times-ad-thanking-kobe-bryant/2013/06/09/|title=Fan Takes Out Full-Page L.A.

'''Aircraft recycling''' is the [[recycling industry]] of [[aircraft]].

==Market==

Each year, 400 to 450 aircraft are scrapped and disassembled globally, for a $2 billion market for aircraft parts, and 12,500 aircraft will reach their end-of-life in the 20 years after 2009.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=ATEMoct2009/&gt;--&gt;
Of those, around one third are parted out and disassembled by members of the [[Aircraft Fleet Recycling Association|AFRA]].&lt;ref name=ATEMoct2009&gt;{{cite article |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722040613/https://afraassociation.org/NewsDocs/09_OctNov_ATE_M.pdf |title= Aircraft recycling best practice and the role of AFRA |magazine= Aircraft Technology Engineering &amp; Maintenance |date= October 2009 |pages= 30-37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The AFRA is an international non-profit association aiming to promote environmental [[best practice]]s, regulatory excellence and sustainable developments in the fields of aircraft disassembly, as well as the salvaging and recycling aircraft parts and materials.

Retirements peaked at more than 700 in 2013 and declined to about 500 in 2016 while strong demand and relatively low fuel prices keep older airliners flying, the in-service aircraft older than 15 years grew by more than 1,600 between 2013 and 2017.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight5mar2018/&gt;--&gt;
As part prices were high in early 2018, some young, 15–20 years old A319 and A320s are being parted out.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight5mar2018/&gt;--&gt;
Decommissions should rise to 750 annually, 3,900 from 2018 through 2022, while manufacturers plan to ramp up deliveries to 2,200 aircraft in 2020.&lt;ref name=Flight5mar2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-aircraft-retirement-wave-poses-challenges-446179/ |title= Aircraft retirement wave poses challenges for recyclers |date= 5 March 2018 |author= Michael Gubisch |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage statistics ==

Lessor [[Avolon]] count 2,100 aircraft are in storage in 2017 with 1,000 which shouldn't fly again: half are parked for more than three years and the other half is older than 25 years.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=MRO6nov2017/&gt;--&gt;
A parked airplane may return to service if it's younger than 15 and aircraft parked over three years have a 50% chance of flying again, dropping to 20% for aircraft stored over five years.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=MRO6nov2017/&gt;--&gt;
With owners accepting their assets value, this 2,100 should remain constant as the global jet transport fleet doubles to 51,800 over the next 20 years with 43,000 new deliveries and 16,000 retirements projected through 2037.&lt;ref name=MRO6nov2017&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mro-network.com/fleet/old-birds |title= Old Birds |at= Smarter end-of-life strategies will cut into storage figures, Avolon says. |author= Lee Ann Shay |date= Nov 6, 2017 |work= Aviation Week Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
[[File:IL-86 RA-86095 Scissor cockpit. (3121102935).jpg|thumb|[[Ilyushin Il-86]] cut at [[Sheremetyevo Airport]]]]

Airliners are typically operated for 20 to 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = Aircraft Recycling |url = http://www.aviationpros.com/article/10874310/aircraft-recycling |date = 28 February 2013 |author= Charles Chandler |work= AviationPros |publisher= [[Cygnus Business Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Corrosion]], [[metal fatigue]], and low availability of new spare parts are problems encountered in greater frequency the older a machine becomes.
Eventually, these factors, alongside improvements in fuel-efficiency and reduction in maintenance cost of newer machines, reduce the economical viability of the operation of older airliners. 
Consequently, they may be stored, or scrapped and recycled.

&lt;!-- storage --&gt;
Vast expanses of arid desert are ideal for storage because hangars are not needed to maintain the aircraft at low humidity. Upon arrival, aircraft are washed to remove corroding salt, drained of fuel and lubricated with a light viscous oil. Explosive devices from the [[evacuation slide]]s are removed, air ducts sealed, and an easily removable protective coat of paint may be applied.&lt;ref name=BBC18sep2014&gt;{{Cite news |title = The secrets of the desert aircraft 'boneyards' |url= http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140918-secrets-of-the-aircraft-boneyards |publisher= BBC |author= Stephen Dowling| date = 18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some airliners are kept in working order as reserves, and a few are involved in fire-fighting and aerospace training schemes or in safety tests.&lt;ref name=BaselNov2006&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161018043030/http://www.grida.no/files/publications/vital-waste2/VWG2_p3to46.pdf |title= Vital Waste Graphics 2 |date= November 2006 |publisher= The Basel Convention Secretariat |author= Claudia Heberlein |page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most are used as source of spare parts and scrapped.
The scrapping process takes six weeks and begins with the removal of the explosive escape equipment and toxic de-icing fluid.
Some components are unbolted and salvaged, including the engines and instruments, while the fuel is drained away.&lt;ref name=AvWeek1Feb2006&gt;{{Cite news |title= Recycling Aircraft |date= 1 Feb 2006 |work= Aviation Week |author= Bill Burchell |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120223114843/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=om&amp;id=news%2Fom206pam.xml &lt;!-- subscription required: http://aviationweek.com/awin/pamela-project--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seats are worth from $450 to $5,000 and the [[landing gear]] can be sold for millions of dollars, although all parts need a Certificate of Airworthiness to be re-used. Cables, batteries and other [[electronic waste]] are fed into the conventional recycling chains.
The remaining shell is cut into pieces and broken down by an [[industrial shredder]] so that the aluminium can be melted down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Where Old Airplanes Go to Die |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/28/business/28iht-wbscrap.html |newspaper= The New York Times |date= March 28, 2009 |issn= 0362-4331 |author= Caroline Brothers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= How To Recycle An Airplane |url= http://jalopnik.com/5569874/how-to-recycle-an-airplane/ |author= Matt Hardigree |date= 22 June 2010 |website = [[Jalopnik]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= How do you recycle a jumbo jet? |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8542482.stm |publisher= BBC |date= 10 March 2010 |author= Mario Cacciottolo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scrap metal is ground up, mechanically sorted by density and magnetism, then sold to the trade.
A future challenge for disposal is the construction of aircraft which use composite materials, such as aluminium/fibreglass [[GLARE]] in the [[Airbus A380]].&lt;ref name=BaselNov2006/&gt;
There are also concerns about contamination with alloys and the dumping of non-recyclable materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://users.ox.ac.uk/~pgrant/Airplane%20scrapping%20and%20recycling.pdf |title= Aircraft Scrapping and Recycling |date= 28 Nov 2007 |publisher= Boeing Commercial Airplanes |work= Airplane Environmental Performance |author= Bill Carberry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:N951AR McDonnell Douglas MD-11F Skylease Cargo (8754546592).jpg|thumb|[[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] part out]]

An airliner can be dismantled in 1,500-2,000 parts (1,000 or so [[Line-replaceable unit|LRU]]s) in 30–60 days including engines, landing gear, auxiliary power units and components but it can be parked a year or two to maximise the part harvesting.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight5mar2018/&gt;--&gt;
A metal aircraft can be recycled up to 85-90% by mass with a 95% goal, and 85-90% could be maintained for composite airframes as the industry adapts with a carbonfibre market growing 12-14% a year towards 100,000t in 2019 of which 50% could be satisfied with recycled material.&lt;ref name=Flight5mar2018/&gt;

== Places ==

The [[Davis–Monthan Air Force Base]] in Arizona is home to 4,400 retired aircraft, chiefly military, and the [[Mojave Air and Space Port]] stores over 1000 civilian planes.&lt;ref name=BBC18sep2014/&gt;
Purpose-built recycling platforms may be used, such as those of Bartin Aero Recycling at [[Châteauroux-Centre "Marcel Dassault" Airport|Châteauroux-Déols airport]] in France, Air Salvage International at [[Cotswold Airport]], UK, and the Evergreen Aircenter, in Marana, US. [[Airbus]] has set up a centre in [[Tarbes–Lourdes–Pyrénées Airport|Tarbes Airport]] in France to research the decommission and recycling of older aircraft as part of the [[PAMELA Project]].&lt;ref name=AvWeek1Feb2006/&gt;

==Achievements==
In 2005, ''[[Al Riyadh (newspaper)|Al Riyadh]]'' reported that Al Bayan Holding Group's Chairman [[Abdul Rahman Al Hammad|Dr. Abdul Rahman Al Hammad]] signed a commercial advertising deal with Minister [[Iyad bin Amin Madani]] of [[Ministry of Culture and Information (Saudi Arabia)|Minister of Culture and Information]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alriyadh.com/76316|title=«البيان» تحتكر إعلانات التلفزيون السعودي بـ 228 مليون ريال|work=جريدة الرياض|access-date=2018-10-01|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2012, ''[[Al Riyadh (newspaper)|Al-Riyadh]]'' reported that the administration of [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah Al Saud]] officially granted Al Bayan Holding Group to organize the annual [[Jenadriyah|Al Jenadriyah]] festival in [[Riyadh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alriyadh.com/712144|title=خادم الحرمين يكرم «مجموعة البيان القابضة» لرعايتها مهرجان الجنادرية|work=جريدة الرياض|access-date=2018-09-18|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2013, ''[[Al Jazirah (newspaper)|Al Jazirah]]'' reported that the then Governor of [[Riyadh]], [[Khalid bin Bandar Al Saud|Prince Khalid bin Bandar bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]], awarded Dr. Al Hammad for the excellent work done by DNGO Contracting Company, one of the entitites of Al Bayan Holding Group for implementing the project of strengthening of water resources in Riyadh&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al-jazirah.com/2013/20130430/ln1.htm|title=بمناسبة تكريم سمو أمير الرياض لمجموعة البيان القابضة|website=www.al-jazirah.com|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
=== Al Hammad as Vice Chairman of Saudi Cooperative Societies Council===
In 2015, ''[[Saudi Gazette]]'' reported that [[Abdul Rahman Al Hammad|Dr. Al Hammad]] was appointed as the new Vice Chairman of [[Cooperative Societies Council|Saudi Cooperative Societies Council]] on 22 November 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/article/145172|title=Al-Hammad urges creation of more Saudi cooperative societies|date=2015-12-24|work=Saudigazette|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Saud Bin Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud|Prince Saud bin Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud]]. However, the incumbency of Dr. Al Hammad's position is disputed after the 2017 crisis when [[Malaysia|Malaysia's]] [[RAM Holdings Berhad|RAM]] suspended Al Bayan Holding Group's ratings.

===Major Contracts===
In 2014, [[Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts]] signed a deal with Al Bayan Holding Group's Dar Al Bayan Real Estate firm in order to launch a hotel in [[Jubail]], [[Saudi Arabia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4051491.html|title=Hilton Worldwide Signs First Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts Property In Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia|last=Net|first=Hospitality|website=Hospitality Net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==2017 Crisis==
In March 2017, [[Malaysia|Malaysia's]] ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'' reported that [[Malaysia|Malaysian]] [[RAM Holdings Berhad|RAM Rating Services]] of RAM Holdings Berhad, [[Kuala Lumpur]] suspended the rating of the RM1bil Sukuk Wakalah (2013/2023) issued by Al Bayan Holding Company following the group’s failure to meet certain obligations under RAM’s rating mandate. This resulted the escalation of Al Bayan's financial crisis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2017/03/07/ram-ratings-suspends-rating-of-al-bayan-rm1b-sukuk/|title=RAM Ratings suspends rating of Al Bayan's RM1b Sukuk - Business News {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
{{quote|“We were unable to contact Al Bayan and seek a satisfactory resolution of outstanding matters.”

 ― RAM}}

After the suspension of RAM ratings, it was reported that many firms started to withdrew their contracts and agreements with Al Bayan Holding Group, indicating that there is a financial crisis undergoing in Al Bayan.

===2017 Anti-Corruption Drive===
It was reported that the [[Government of Saudi Arabia|Saudi government]] arrested co-owners of Al Bayan Holding Group in November 2017, including [[Abdul Rahman Al Hammad|Dr. Abdul Rahman Al Hammad]], following [[Muhammad bin Salman|Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman's]] launch of [[2017 Saudi Arabian purge|2017 Anti-Corruption Drive]]. However, these suspicions and allegations didn't appeared in the local press of [[Saudi Arabia]].

===Social Media Outrage===
In December 2017, an Egyptian expatriate calling himself as an employee of Al Bayan Holding Group uploaded a video on YouTube where he explained about his mental harassment in the firm via the four co-owners. He also requested the arrest of co-owners and clearance of his dues through intervention of [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman Al Saud]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Medhat Bogee|title=استغاثة العاملين بشركة مجموعة البيان القابضة بالرياض|date=2017-11-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFPMCereqxI&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;The same person uploaded a video in late December 2017 or early January 2018 where he records a footage through his mobile phone in which he shows a group of stranded employees of DNGO Contracting Company and Nahdaat Al Emaar, the two subsidiaries of Al Bayan Holding Group without their dues and salaries calling for justice&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Medhat Bogee|title=تكملة للاستغاثة للعاملين بشركة مجموعة البيان القابضة دونجو ونهضة الاعمار للمقاولات|date=2017-11-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTP92l44gsI&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In early January 2017, an person informing himself as an engineer assigned at Al Bayan Holding Group recorded a footage via his mobile phone and later uploaded it on [[YouTube]]. In the video, he had shown that employees holding banners are on strike against the firm as some of them didn't receive their dues and salaries from the past 13 months&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Engr.Sherief.Ahmed|title=اعتصام موظفين مجموعة البيان القابضة بادارة الشركة بالعليا والشركة تطلب الشرطة للموظفين|date=2018-01-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=cCq1BJq1THg&amp;app=desktop|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Economic systems sidebar|By coordination}}
'''Autarky''' is the [[quality (philosophy)|quality]] of being [[Self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]]; the term is usually applied to political states or their [[economic system]]s. Autarky exists whenever an entity can survive or continue its activities without external assistance or [[international trade]]. If a self-sufficient [[economy]] also ''refuses'' all trade with the outside world then it is called a '''closed economy'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/c.html#ClosedEconomy|Deardorff's Glossary of International Economics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212072813/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/c.html |date=2007-12-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "closed economy" is also used technically as an abstraction to allow consideration of a single economy without taking foreign trade into account – i.e. as the antonym of [[open economy]]. Autarky in the political sense is not necessarily an economic phenomenon; for example, a [[military]] autarky would be a state that could defend itself without help from another country, or could manufacture all of its weapons without any imports from the outside world.

Autarky as an ideal or method has been embraced by a wide range of [[political ideologies]] and [[Civil rights movements|movements]], especially [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] creeds like [[African socialism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], [[council communism]], [[syndicalism]] (especially [[anarcho-syndicalism]]) and [[Left-wing populism|leftist populism]]. It has also been used in temporary, limited ways by [[Conservatism|conservative]], [[Centrism|centrist]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements, such as the [[American System (economic plan)|American system]], the [[Meiji Restoration#Centralization|Meiji Restoration]], [[social corporatism]], [[Juche]], and [[traditionalist conservatism]]. [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] movements occasionally [[Strasserism|claimed]] to strive for autarky in platform or propaganda, but in practice crushed existing movements towards self-sufficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42462895|title=Italian fascism : its origins &amp; development|orig-year=1938|author=De Grand, Alexander J.|year=2000|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803266227|edition= 3rd|location=Lincoln|oclc=42462895}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained extensive capital connections in efforts to ready for expansionist war and genocide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45896166|title=IBM and the Holocaust : the strategic alliance between Nazi Germany and America's most powerful corporation|last=Edwin.|first=Black,|date=2001|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0609607995|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=45896166}}&lt;/ref&gt; while allying with traditional business elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58452991|title=The anatomy of fascism|last=O.|first=Paxton, Robert|date=2005|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=1400033918|edition= 1st Vintage books|location=New York|oclc=58452991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autarky may be a policy of a state or other entity when it seeks to be self-sufficient as a whole, but also can be limited to a narrow field such as possession of a key raw material. For example, many countries have a policy of autarky with respect to foodstuffs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aic.ucdavis.edu/research1/BerlinSumner.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140120232431/http://aic.ucdavis.edu/research1/BerlinSumner.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and water for national security reasons. By contrast, autarky may be a result of economic isolation or external circumstances in which a state or other entity reverts to localized production when it lacks currency or excess production to trade with the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Computer Simulations of International Trade and Conflict | journal=Economic Interdependence and International Conflict: New Perspectives on an Enduring Debate | editor1=Mansfield, Edward D.|editor2=Pollins, Brian M.  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L53fR-TusZAC | page=333| isbn=0472022938 | date=2009-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Socialism in Provence, 1871–1914 | author=Judt, Tony | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeygBwAAQBAJ | page=263| isbn=9780814743553 | date=2011-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The word ''autarky'' is from the {{lang-el|αὐτάρκεια}}, which means "self-sufficiency" (derived from αὐτο-, "self," and ἀρκέω, "to suffice"). The term is sometimes confused with [[autocracy]] (Greek: αὐτoκρατία "government by single absolute ruler")  or [[autarchy]] (Greek: αὐταρχία – the idea of rejecting government and ruling oneself and no other).

== History ==

===Ancient and medieval===
Early state societies that can be regarded as autarkic include [[nomadic pastoralism]] and [[palace economy]], though over time these tend towards becoming less self-sufficient and more interconnected. The late [[Bronze Age]], for example, saw formerly self-sufficient palace economies rely more heavily on trade, which may have been a contributing factor to the eventual [[Late Bronze Age collapse|Bronze Age Collapse]] when multiple crises hit those systems at once.

[[Medieval commune]]s combined an attempt at overall economic self-sufficiency through the use of common lands and resources with mutual defense pacts against the depredations of the local nobility. Many of these communes later became trading powers such as the [[Hanseatic League]]. In some cases, communal village economies maintained their own debt system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/426794447|title=Debt : the first 5,000 years|last=David.|first=Graeber,|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|isbn=1612191290|location=Brooklyn, N.Y.|oclc=426794447}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a self-sufficient economy and to avoid reliance on possibly hostile aristocratic or business interests.

===19th and early 20th centuries===
Autarkic ambitions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3650099|title=The Populist moment : a short history of the agrarian revolt in America|last=Lawrence.|first=Goodwyn|isbn=0195024176|location=New York|oclc=3650099}}&lt;/ref&gt; can also be seen in the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist]] backlash to the exploitations of free trade in the late 19th-century and in many early [[Utopian socialism|Utopian Socialist]] movements. [[Benefit society|Mutual aid societies]] like the [[National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]] and [[Sovereigns of Industry]] attempted to set up self-sufficient economies (with varying degrees of success) in an effort to be less dependent on what they saw as an exploitative economic system and to generate more power to push for reforms.

Early socialist movements used these autarkic efforts to build their base with institutions like the [[Bourse du Travail|Bourse de travail]], socialist canteens and food assistance. These played a major role in securing workers' loyalty and building those parties into increasingly powerful institutions (especially in Europe) throughout the late 19th and early 20th-centuries. Through these cooperatives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/731911132 |title= The Guns of August: The proud tower |last= Tuchman |first= Barbara W. |year=2012 |publisher= Library of America |others= MacMillan, Margaret |isbn= 159853145X |location= New York, NY |pages=1046 |oclc= 731911132}}&lt;/ref&gt; "workers bought Socialist bread and Socialist shoes, drank Socialist beer, arranged for Socialist vacations and obtained a Socialist education."

Local and regional farming autarkies in many areas of [[Africa]] and [[Southeast Asia]] were displaced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37392803|title=Seeing like a state : how certain schemes to improve the human condition have failed|last=C.|first=Scott, James|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300070160|location=New Haven|oclc=37392803}}&lt;/ref&gt; by European colonial administrations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who sought to push smallholder villages into larger plantations that, while less productive, they could more easily control.

Communist movements embraced or dismissed autarky as a goal at different times. Some socialist communities like [[Charles Fourier]]'s [[Phalanstère|phalansteres]] strove for self-sufficiency. The early [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] strove for a self-sufficient economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40510540|title=Red victory : a history of the Russian Civil War|last=Bruce.|first=Lincoln, W.|year=1999|publisher=Da Capo|isbn=0306809095|edition= 1st Da Capo Press|location=New York|oclc=40510540}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[War communism|War Communism]], but later pursued international trade vigorously under the [[New Economic Policy]]. However, while the Soviet government during the latter period encouraged some international trade, it also permitted and even encouraged&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30841557|title=The making of the Soviet system : essays in the social history of interwar Russia|last=1921-2010.|first=Lewin, Moshe,|date=1994|publisher=New Press|isbn=1565841255|location=New York|oclc=30841557}}&lt;/ref&gt; local autarkies in many peasant villages.

Right-wing totalitarian governments that have claimed to strive for autarky have often pursued a very different policy in fact, just as some claimed to be in favor of socialism while killing socialists. In 1921 Italian [[Italian Fascism|Fascists]] attacked existing left-wing autarkic projects at the behest of large landowners, destroying roughly 119 labor chambers, 107 cooperatives and 83 peasant offices that year alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42462895|title=Italian fascism : its origins &amp; development|last=De Grand|first= Alexander J.|year=2000|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803266227|edition= 3rd|location=Lincoln|pages=31–33|oclc=42462895}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazi Germany]] under economics minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]] claimed to strive for self-sufficiency but pursued major international trade, albeit under a different system, to escape the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The regime would continue to conduct trade, including with countries like the United States, including connections with major companies like [[IBM and the Holocaust|IBM]] and [[Fanta|Coca-Cola]].

===After World War II===
Economic self-sufficiency was pursued as a goal by some members of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], such as [[India]] under [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NAYAR|first=BALDEV RAJ|date=1997|title=Nationalist Planning for Autarky and State Hegemony : Development Strategy Under Nehru|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24010467|journal=Indian Economic Review|volume=32|issue=1|pages=13–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tanzania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malima|first=Kighoma A.|date=1979|title=PLANNING FOR SELF-RELIANCE TANZANIA'S THIRD FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24498250|journal=Africa Development / Afrique et Développement|volume=4|issue=1|pages=37–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the ideology of [[Ujamaa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1024254210|title=State Ideology and Language in Tanzania : Second and Revised Edition.|last=Jan.|first=Blommaert,|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780748668267|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford|oclc=1024254210}}&lt;/ref&gt; and swadeshi. hat was partly an effort to escape the economic domination of both the United States and the Soviet Union while modernizing the countries' infrastructure.

Small-scale autarkies were sometimes used by the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]], such as in the case of the [[Montgomery bus boycott|Montgomery Bus Boycott]], where boycotters set up their own self-sufficient system of cheap or free transit to allow black residents to get to work and avoid using the then-segregated public systems in a successful effort to bring political pressure.

After World War II, [[Autonomism|Autonomist efforts]] in Europe embraced autarkic projects in an effort to craft anti-authoritarian left-wing spaces, especially influencing the [[social center]] and [[squatting|squatters]]' rights movements. Such efforts remain a common feature of Autonomist and anarchist movements on the continent today. The Micropolis social centre in Greece, for example, has gyms, restaurants, bars, meeting space and free distribution of food and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/984595655|title=Antifa : the anti-fascist handbook|last=activist),|first=Bray, Mark (Political|isbn=1612197035|location=Brooklyn, NY|oclc=984595655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1970, the [[Black Panther Party]] moved away from communist internationalism towards "intercommunalism," a term coined&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libcom.org/library/huey-newton-introduces-revolutionary-intercommunalism-boston-college-november-18-1970|title=Huey Newton introduces Revolutionary Intercommunalism, Boston College, November 18 1970|website=libcom.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Huey P. Newton]], "to retain a grasp on the local when the rest of radical thought seemed to be moving global." Intercommunalism drew&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thenewinquiry.com/the-havoc-of-less/|title=The Havoc of Less|date=2017-09-15|work=The New Inquiry|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206132434/https://thenewinquiry.com/the-havoc-of-less/|archivedate=2018-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from left-wing autarkic projects like free medical clinics and breakfast programs, "explicitly articulated as attempts to fill a void left by the failure of the federal government to provide resources as basic as food to black communities."

Autarkic efforts to counter forcible privatization of public resources and maintain local self-sufficiency also formed a key part of [[alter-globalization]] efforts. The [[Cochabamba Water War]] had Bolivians successfully oppose the privatization of their water system to keep the resource in public hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56194844|title=Cochabamba!: Water War in Bolivia|last=Oscar.|first=Olivera,|date=2004|publisher=South End Press|others=Lewis, Tom, |isbn=9780896087026|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=56194844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
Today, national economic autarkies are relatively rare. A commonly-cited example is [[North Korea]], based on the government ideology of [[Juche]] ([[self-sufficiency]]), which is concerned with maintaining its domestic localized economy in the face of its isolation. However, even North Korea has extensive trade with [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Syria]], [[Iran]], [[Vietnam]], and many countries in Europe and Africa. North Korea had to import food during a widespread [[North Korean famine|famine in the 1990s]].

A better modern example at a societal level is the autonomous region of [[Rojava]], the autonomous northern region of [[Syria]]. Cut off from international trade, facing multiple enemies, and striving for a society based on democratic confederalism and the ideals of [[Murray Bookchin]], Rojava's government and constitution emphasize economic self-sufficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A small key can open a large door: the Rojava revolution|editor=Strangers In A Tangled Wilderness|isbn=193866017X|location=United States|oclc=900796070}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by neighborhood and village councils, with property and business belonging to those who live in or use it towards that goal.

An example of an contemporary effort at localized autarky, incorporating the concept's history from [[black nationalism]], Ujamaa and [[African-American socialism]] and the civil rights movement, is Cooperation Jackson,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cooperationjackson.org/|title=Welcome|website=Cooperation Jackson|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a movement aimed at creating a self-sufficient black working class economy in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. The movement has aimed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/976416348|title=Jackson rising : the struggle for economic recovery and black self-determination in Jackson, Mississippi|others=Nangwaya, Ajamu,, Cooperation Jackson,|isbn=9780995347458|location=Montreal, Quebec|oclc=976416348}}&lt;/ref&gt; to secure land and build self-sufficient cooperatives and workplaces "to democratically transform the political economy of the city" and push back against gentrification. Cooperation Jackson also saw a gain in electoral political power when its involvement proved pivotal to the 2013 mayoral election of [[Chokwe Lumumba]] and the 2017 election of his son, [[Chokwe Antar Lumumba]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22147">In [[pharmacology]], '''bioavailability''' ('''''BA or F''''' ) is a subcategory of absorption and is the fraction of an administered [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] of unchanged drug that reaches the [[systemic circulation]], one of the principal [[pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] properties of [[medication|drugs]]. By definition, when a medication is administered [[intravenous]]ly, its bioavailability is 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=J. P.|title=The Textbook of Pharmaceutical Medicine|edition=6th|location=New Jersey|publisher=BMJ Books|ISBN=978-1-4051-8035-1}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when a medication is administered via other [[route of administration|routes]] (such as orally), its bioavailability generally{{cref|TH}} decreases (due to incomplete absorption and [[first-pass metabolism]]) or may vary from patient to patient. Bioavailability is one of the essential tools in pharmacokinetics, as bioavailability must be considered when calculating dosages for non-intravenous routes of administration.

For [[dietary supplements]], herbs and other nutrients in which the route of administration is nearly always oral, bioavailability generally designates simply the quantity or fraction of the ingested dose that is absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert P. |last1=Heaney |title=Factors Influencing the Measurement of Bioavailability, Taking Calcium as a Model |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |pmid=11285351 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11285351 |year=2001 |volume=131 |issue=4 |pages=1344S–8S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioavailability is defined slightly differently for drugs as opposed to [[dietary supplements]] primarily due to the method of administration and [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulations.

== Definitions ==

=== In pharmacology ===

In pharmacology, bioavailability is a measurement of the rate and extent to which a drug reaches at the site of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shargel|first1=L.|last2=Yu|first2=A. B.|date=1999|title=Applied Biopharmaceutics &amp; Pharmacokinetics|edition=4th|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|ISBN=0-8385-0278-4}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is denoted by the letter ''f'' (or, if expressed in percent, by ''F'').

=== In nutritional sciences ===

In nutritional sciences, which covers the intake of nutrients and non-drug dietary ingredients, the concept of bioavailability lacks the well-defined standards associated with the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmacological definition cannot apply to these substances because utilization and absorption is a function of the nutritional status and physiological state of the subject,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11285351 |year=2001 |last1=Heaney |first1=Robert P. |title=Factors Influencing the Measurement of Bioavailability, Taking Calcium as a Model |volume=131 |issue=4 Suppl. |pages=1344–1348S |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11285351}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in even greater differences from individual to individual (inter-individual variation). Therefore, bioavailability for dietary supplements can be defined as the proportion of the administered substance capable of being absorbed and available for use or storage.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11285352 |year=2001 |last1=Srinivasan |first1=V. Srini |title=Bioavailability of Nutrients: A Practical Approach to In Vitro Demonstration of the Availability of Nutrients in Multivitamin-Mineral Combination Products |volume=131 |issue=4 Suppl. |pages=1349–1350S |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |url=https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/131/4/1349S/4686865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both pharmacology and nutrition sciences, bioavailability is measured by calculating the [[area under curve]] (AUC) of the drug concentration time profile.

=== In environmental sciences or science===

Bioavailability is the measure by which various substances in the environment may enter into living organisms.  It is commonly a limiting factor in the production of crops (due to solubility limitation or adsorption of plant nutrients to soil colloids) and in the removal of toxic substances from the food chain by microorganisms (due to sorption to or partitioning of otherwise degradable substances into inaccessible phases in the environment). A noteworthy example for agriculture is plant phosphorus deficiency induced by precipitation with iron and aluminum phosphates at low soil pH and precipitation with calcium phosphates at high soil pH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1013351617532 |year=2001 |last1=Hinsinger |first1=Philippe |title=Bioavailability of soil inorganic P in the rhizosphere as affected by root-induced chemical changes: a review |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=237 |issue=2 |pages=173–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic materials in soil, such as lead from paint may be rendered unavailable to animals ingesting contaminated soil by supplying phosphorus fertilizers in excess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es00046a007 |title=In situ lead immobilization by apatite |year=1993 |last1=Ma |first1=Qi-Ying |last2=Traina |first2=Samuel J. |last3=Logan |first3=Terry J. |last4=Ryan |first4=James A. |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=1803–1810}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organic pollutants such as solvents or pesticides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sims|first=G.K. |first2=M. |last2=Radosevich |first3=X.-T. |last3=He |first4=S.

== Absolute bioavailability ==
[[File:AUC IVPO.svg|thumb|Absolute bioavailability is a ratio of areas under the curves. IV, intravenous; PO, oral route. C is plasma concentration (arbitrary units)]]

Absolute bioavailability compares the bioavailability of the active drug in systemic circulation following non-[[intravenous]] [[route of administration|administration]] (i.e., after [[per os|oral]], ocular, rectal, [[transdermal]], [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]], or [[sublingual]] administration), with the bioavailability of the same drug following intravenous administration. It is the fraction of the drug absorbed through non-intravenous administration compared with the corresponding intravenous administration of the same drug. The comparison must be dose normalized (e.g., account for different doses or varying weights of the subjects); consequently, the amount absorbed is corrected by dividing the corresponding dose administered.

In pharmacology, in order to determine absolute bioavailability of a drug, a [[pharmacokinetic]] study must be done to obtain a ''plasma drug concentration vs time'' plot for the drug after both intravenous (iv) and extravascular (non-intravenous, i.e., oral) administration. The absolute bioavailability is the dose-corrected area under curve (''AUC'') non-intravenous divided by ''AUC'' intravenous. The formula for calculating the absolute bioavailability, ''F'', of a drug administered orally (po) is given below (where ''D'' is dose administered).

: &lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm{abs} = 100 \cdot \frac{AUC_\mathrm{po} \cdot D_\mathrm{iv}}{AUC_\mathrm{iv} \cdot D_\mathrm{po}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, a drug given by the intravenous route will have an absolute bioavailability of 100% (''f'' = 1), whereas drugs given by other routes usually have an absolute bioavailability of ''less'' than one.
If we compare the two different dosage forms having same active ingredients and compare the two drug bioavailability is called comparative bioavailability.

Although knowing the true extent of systemic absorption (referred to as absolute bioavailability) is clearly useful, in practice it is not determined as frequently as one may think. The reason for this is that its assessment requires an ''intravenous reference''; that is, a route of administration that guarantees all of the administered drug reaches systemic circulation. Such studies come at considerable cost, not least of which is the necessity to conduct preclinical toxicity tests to ensure adequate safety, as well as potential problems due to solubility limitations. These limitations may be overcome, however, by administering a very low dose (typically a few micrograms) of an [[Isotopic labeling|isotopically labelled drug]] concomitantly with a therapeutic non-isotopically labelled oral dose (the isotopically-labelled intravenous dose is sufficiently low so as not to perturb the systemic drug concentrations achieved from the non-labelled oral dose). The intravenous and oral concentrations can then be deconvoluted by virtue of their different isotopic constitution, and can thus be used to determine the oral and intravenous pharmacokinetics from the same dose administration. This technique eliminates pharmacokinetic issues with non-equivalent clearance as well as enabling the intravenous dose to be administered with a minimum of toxicology and formulation. The technique was first applied using stable-isotopes such as &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and mass-spectrometry to distinguish the isotopes by mass difference. More recently, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C labelled drugs are administered intravenously and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) used to measure the isotopically labelled drug along with mass spectrometry for the unlabelled drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1517/17425255.2.3.419 |title=The use of isotopes in the determination of absolute bioavailability of drugs in humans |year=2006 |last1=Lappin |first1=Graham |last2=Rowland |first2=Malcolm |last3=Garner |first3=R. Colin |journal=Expert Opinion on Drug Metabolism &amp; Toxicology |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=419–427 |pmid=16863443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no regulatory requirement to define the intravenous pharmacokinetics or absolute bioavailability however regulatory authorities do sometimes ask for absolute bioavailability information of the extravascular route in cases in which the bioavailability is apparently low or variable and there is a proven relationship between the [[pharmacodynamics]] and the pharmacokinetics at therapeutic doses. In all such cases, to conduct an absolute bioavailability study requires that the drug be given intravenously.&lt;ref name="Graham Lappin 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1517/17425255.4.8.1021 |title=Biomedical accelerator mass spectrometry: Recent applications in metabolism and pharmacokinetics |year=2008 |last1=Lappin |first1=Graham |last2=Stevens |first2=Lloyd |journal=Expert Opinion on Drug Metabolism &amp; Toxicology |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=1021–1033 |pmid=18680438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intravenous administration of a developmental drug can provide valuable information on the fundamental pharmacokinetic parameters of [[volume of distribution]] (''V'') and [[Clearance (medicine)|clearance]] (''CL'').&lt;ref name="Graham Lappin 2008" /&gt;

== Relative bioavailability and bioequivalence ==

In pharmacology, relative bioavailability measures the bioavailability (estimated as the ''AUC'') of a formulation (A) of a certain drug when compared with another formulation (B) of the same drug, usually an established standard, or through administration via a different route. When the standard consists of intravenously administered drug, this is known as absolute bioavailability (see [[#Absolute bioavailability|above]]).

: &lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm{rel} = 100 \cdot \frac{AUC_\mathrm{A} \cdot D_\mathrm{B}}{AUC_\mathrm{B} \cdot D_\mathrm{A}}&lt;/math&gt;

Relative bioavailability is one of the measures used to assess [[bioequivalence]] (''BE'') between two drug products. For FDA approval, a generic manufacturer must demonstrate that the 90% [[confidence interval]] for the ratio of the mean responses (usually of ''AUC'' and the maximum concentration, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of its product to that of the "brand name drug"{{cref|OB}} is within the limits of 80% to 125%. Where ''AUC'' refers to the concentration of the drug in the blood over time ''t'' = 0 to ''t'' = ∞, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the maximum concentration of the drug in the blood. When ''T''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is given, it refers to the time it takes for a drug to reach ''C''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.

While the mechanisms by which a formulation affects bioavailability and bioequivalence have been extensively studied in drugs, formulation factors that influence bioavailability and bioequivalence in nutritional supplements are largely unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11285360 |year=2001 |last1=Hoag |first1=Stephen W. |last2=Hussain |first2=Ajaz S. |title=The Impact of Formulation on Bioavailability: Summary of Workshop Discussion |volume=131 |issue=4 Suppl. |pages=1389–1391S |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11285360}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in nutritional sciences, relative bioavailability or bioequivalence is the most common measure of bioavailability, comparing the bioavailability of one formulation of the same dietary ingredient to another.

== Factors influencing bioavailability ==

The absolute bioavailability of a drug, when administered by an extravascular route, is usually less than one (i.e., ''F''&lt; 100%). Various physiological factors reduce the availability of drugs prior to their entry into the systemic circulation. Whether a drug is taken with or without food will also affect absorption, other drugs taken concurrently may alter absorption and first-pass metabolism, intestinal motility alters the dissolution of the drug and may affect the degree of chemical degradation of the drug by intestinal microflora. Disease states affecting liver metabolism or gastrointestinal function will also have an effect.

Other factors may include, but are not limited to:
* Physical properties of the drug ([[Hydrophobe|hydrophobicity]], [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]], [[solubility]])
* The drug formulation (immediate release, excipients used, manufacturing methods, [[Time release technology|modified release]] – delayed release, extended release, sustained release, etc.)
* Whether the formulation is administered in a fed or [[fasting|fasted]] state
* Gastric emptying rate
* [[Circadian]] differences
* Interactions with other drugs/foods:
** Interactions with other drugs (e.g., [[antacid]]s, alcohol, nicotine)
** Interactions with other foods (e.g., [[grapefruit juice]], [[pomello]], [[cranberry juice]], [[brassica]] vegetables)
* Transporters: Substrate of [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] transporters (e.g. [[P-glycoprotein]])
* Health of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]]
* [[Enzyme]] induction/inhibition by other drugs/foods:
** Enzyme induction (increased rate of metabolism), e.g., [[Phenytoin]] induces [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2C19]], and [[CYP3A4]]
** [[Enzyme inhibitor|Enzyme inhibition]] (decreased rate of metabolism), e.g., grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A → higher nifedipine concentrations
* Individual variation in metabolic differences
** Age: In general, drugs are metabolized more slowly in fetal, neonatal, and geriatric populations
** [[Phenotype#Phenotypic variation|Phenotypic differences]], [[enterohepatic circulation]], diet, gender
* Disease state
** E.g., [[hepatic]] insufficiency, poor [[renal]] function

Each of these factors may vary from patient to patient (inter-individual variation), and indeed in the same patient over time (intra-individual variation). In [[clinical trial]]s, inter-individual variation is a critical measurement used to assess the bioavailability differences from patient to patient in order to ensure predictable dosing.

== Bioavailability of drugs versus dietary supplements ==

In comparison to drugs, there are significant differences in dietary supplements that impact the evaluation of their bioavailability. These differences include the following: the fact that nutritional supplements provide benefits that are variable and often qualitative in nature; the measurement of nutrient absorption lacks the precision; nutritional supplements are consumed for prevention and well-being; nutritional supplements do not exhibit characteristic [[dose-response relationship|dose-response curves]]; and dosing intervals of nutritional supplements, therefore, are not critical in contrast to drug therapy.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan" /&gt;

In addition, the lack of defined methodology and regulations surrounding the consumption of dietary supplements hinders the application of bioavailability measures in comparison to drugs. In clinical trials with dietary supplements, bioavailability primarily focuses on statistical descriptions of mean or average AUC differences between treatment groups, while often failing to compare or discuss their standard deviations or inter-individual variation. This failure leaves open the question of whether or not an individual in a group is likely to experience the benefits described by the mean-difference comparisons. Further, even if this issue were discussed, it would be difficult to communicate meaning of these inter-subject variances to consumers and/or their physicians.

== Nutritional science: reliable and universal bioavailability ==

One way to resolve this problem is to define "reliable bioavailability" as positive bioavailability results (an absorption meeting a predefined criterion) that include 84% of the trial subjects and "universal bioavailability" as those that include 98% of the trial subjects. This reliable-universal framework would improve communications with physicians and consumers such that, if it were included on products labels for example, make educated choices as to the benefits of a formulation for them directly. In addition, the reliable-universal framework is similar to the construction of confidence intervals, which statisticians have long offered as one potential solution for dealing with small samples, violations of statistical assumptions or large standard deviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kagan |first1=Daniel |last2=Madhavi |first2=Doddabele |last3=Bank |first3=Ginny |last4=Lachlan |first4=Kenneth |title='Universal' and 'Reliable' Bioavailability Claims: Criteria That May Increase Physician Confidence in Nutritional Supplements |journal=Natural Medicine Journal |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |year=2010 |url=http://naturalmedicinejournal.net/pdf/NMJ_JAN10_NaPh.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''blank cheque''' (US: '''blank check''') or '''carte blanche''', in the literal sense, is a [[cheque]] that has no monetary [[Value (mathematics)|value]] written in, but is already signed. In the figurative sense, it is used to describe a situation in which an agreement has been made that is open-ended or vague, and therefore subject to abuse, or in which a party is willing to consider any expense in the pursuance of their goals.

== Literal meaning ==
Cheque writers are advised to specify the amount of the cheque before signing it. A blank cheque can be extremely expensive for the drawer who writes the cheque, because whoever obtains the cheque could write in any amount of money, and might be able to cash it (if the [[Transaction account|current account]] (US: checking account) contains sufficient funds, and depending on the laws in the specific country). Under [[Law of the United States|American law]], a blank cheque is an example of an "{{visible anchor|incomplete instrument}}" as defined in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]]'s Article 3, Section 115 (a).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§ 3-115. INCOMPLETE INSTRUMENT|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/3-115|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=26 November 2016|language=en|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing an amount in a blank cheque, without the authority of the signer, is an "alteration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§ 3-407. ALTERATION.|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/3-407|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=26 November 2016|language=en|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is legally equivalent to changing the numbers on a completed (non-blank) cheque.

In [[finance]], a "blank cheque company" refers to a company in development that has no specific business plan, such as a special purpose acquisition company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blank Check Company|url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/blankcheck.htm|website=www.sec.gov|publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route==
Broadway begins at [[Main Street (Los Angeles)|Main Street]] just north of the [[Interstate 405 (California)|San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405)]]. From there it runs {{convert|10|mi|km}} north from [[South Los Angeles]] to [[Downtown Los Angeles|Downtown]], connecting [[Carson, California|Carson]], [[Rosewood, Los Angeles County|Rosewood]], and  [[Athens, California|Athens]].

After entering Downtown, it passes through Broadway's historic [[commercial district]] and [[Broadway Theater and Commercial District|theatre district]], then enters the [[Civic Center, Los Angeles|Los Angeles Civic Center]] and passes through [[Grand Park]].

After crossing the [[Hollywood Freeway|Hollywood Freeway (US 101)]] and [[Cesar Chavez Avenue]], signs along the street change to read "North Broadway" as it enters [[Chinatown (Los Angeles)|Chinatown]] and then passes through the Dragon Gate and Central Plaza. It then curves northeast, passing through the old railyards north of Downtown Los Angeles. After crossing the [[Interstate 5 in California|Golden State Freeway (Interstate 5)]] it heads due east to its terminus at Mission Road in [[Lincoln Heights, Los Angeles|Lincoln Heights]].

==History==
Broadway is one of the oldest streets in the city, it was laid out as part of the 1849 plan of Los Angeles made by Lieutenant [[Edward Ord]] and named Fort Street. Fort Street began at the south side of [[Fort Moore|Fort Moore Hill]] (a block north of [[Temple Street (Los Angeles)|Temple Street]]) at Sand Street (later California Street).

In 1890, the name of Fort Street, from [[1st Street (Los Angeles)|1st Street]] to [[Los Angeles streets, 1-10#|10th Street]], was changed to Broadway. The rest of Fort Street, from California Street to 1st Street, was changed to North Broadway.&lt;ref name=lat-1889sep06&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/163467011.html |title=City In Brief. |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 6, 1889 |page=8 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |subscription=yes}} [http://search.proquest.com/docview/163467011/ Alternate Link] via [[ProQuest]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lat-1890feb18&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/163516086.html |title=No Title |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 18, 1890 |page=4 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |subscription=yes}} [http://search.proquest.com/docview/163516086/ Alternate Link] via [[ProQuest]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposal for opening Broadway through to Buena Vista Street (now North Broadway), and extending the street south into what was then part of [[Main Street (Los Angeles)|Main Street]], below Tenth Street, in order to give a continuous, wide thoroughfare from the southern [[city limits]] to the [[East Los Angeles (region)|Eastside]], was made as early as February 1891.&lt;ref name=lat-1891feb26&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/163524656.html |title=Sou', Sou'west. |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 26, 1891 |page=4 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |subscription=yes}} [http://search.proquest.com/docview/163524656/ Alternate Link] via [[ProQuest]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Broadway Tunnel (Los Angeles)|Broadway Tunnel]] under Fort Moore Hill was opened in 1901, extending North Broadway to Buena Vista Street at Bellevue Avenue (later [[Sunset Boulevard]], now [[Cesar Chavez Avenue]]).  A section of Broadway in South Los Angeles was originally named Moneta Avenue until 1923.&lt;ref name=lat-1922dec10&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/161208643.html |title=Realtors Want New Boulevard: Ask Supervisors for Route Connecting Moneta Avenue With Harbor |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 10, 1922 |page=V9 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |subscription=yes}} [http://search.proquest.com/docview/161208643/ Alternate Link] via [[ProQuest]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, construction on a bridge across the [[Los Angeles River]] was begun to connect Buena Vista Street to Downey Avenue, which ran from the river to Mission Road. The names of Buena Vista and Downey were then changed to North Broadway,&lt;ref name=lat-1909nov30&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/159317712.html |title=A Literary Fog. |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 30, 1909 |page=II4 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |subscription=yes}} [http://search.proquest.com/docview/159317712/ Alternate Link] via [[ProQuest]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lat-1911jan22&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/159604470.html |title=The Lancer |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 22, 1911 |page=II5 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |subscription=yes}} [http://search.proquest.com/docview/159604470/ Alternate Link] via [[ProQuest]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lah-1908september19&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH19080919.2.127.5 |title=Downey And Buena Vista Will Be North Broadway |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Herald]] |date=September 19, 1908 |volume=35 |number=353 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |via=[[California Digital Newspaper Collection]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not without significant objections from affected residents and landowners.&lt;ref name=lah-1905january14&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH19050114.2.110 |title=Object to Changing Name |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Herald]] |date=January 14, 1905 |volume=32 |number=105 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |via=[[California Digital Newspaper Collection]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lah-1905may27&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH19050527.2.94 |title=Buena Vista Street Will Continue Name: Will Not Be Changed to North Broadway |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Herald]] |date=May 27, 1905 |volume=32 |number=238 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |via=[[California Digital Newspaper Collection]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lah-1908october25&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH19081025.2.32 |title=Object to Merger Of Downey Avenue |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Herald]] |date=October 25, 1908 |volume=36 |number=24 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |via=[[California Digital Newspaper Collection]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lah-1910april19&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH19100419.2.144.6 |title=East Side Residents, Prefer Downey Avenue |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Herald]] |date=April 19, 1910 |volume=37 |number=200 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |via=[[California Digital Newspaper Collection]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bridge, which continued to be referred to as the Buena Vista Street Bridge for a good while, was opened to traffic in late September 1911.&lt;ref name=lat-1911sep24&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/159704885.html |title=Majestic; Great Viaduct About Ready; Cars Run Over the Buena Vista Structure; Concrete Bridge Across Los Angeles River Weighs Nearly Forty Thousand Tons, Cost Two Hundred and Seventy-five Thousand Dollars&amp;mdash;Without a Peer in West. |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 24, 1911 |page=II1 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |subscription=yes}} [http://search.proquest.com/docview/159704885/ Alternate Link] via [[ProQuest]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial and theater district===
For more than 50 years, Broadway from [[1st Street (Los Angeles)|1st Street]] to [[Olympic Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Olympic Boulevard]] was the main commercial street of Los Angeles, and one of its premier theater and [[movie palace]] districts as well. It contains a vast number of historic buildings and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Before [[World War II]], Broadway was considered by many to be the center of the city, where residents went to ornate [[movie palace]]s and live theaters, and shopped at major [[department store]]s and shops. Some historically significant buildings include the [[Bradbury Building]], [[United Artists Theater]], and the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Examiner]]'' building designed by [[Julia Morgan]].

[[File:Los Angeles Tower Theatre clocktower.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Clock tower]] of the [[Tower Theatre (Los Angeles)|Tower Theatre]]]]
Some of the [[movie theater]]s on the street fell into disuse and disrepair, some were replaced with parking lots, but many have been repurposed and/or restored. The department stores closed in the 1970s and 1980s, but Broadway has been the premier shopping destination for [[working class]] [[Latino]]s for decades.&lt;ref name="latimesJan282008"&gt;{{cite news |last1=DiMassa |first1=Cara |last2=Bloomekatz |first2=Ari B. |last-author-amp=yes |title=L.A. plans Broadway face-lift |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |pages=B1, B8 |date=January 28, 2008 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-broadway28jan28,1,1421189.story}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Downtown's real estate revitalization, using the City's [[adaptive reuse]] ordinance that makes it easier for developers to convert outmoded and/or vacant office and commercial buildings into residential buildings, has reached the Broadway Historic District. It includes the transformation of the United Artists Theater office tower into the [[Ace Hotel Los Angeles]], and restoration of its movie palace.

The [[Bringing Back Broadway]] commission is working on further reviving the landmark Los Angeles boulevard in the historic district. Led by [[Los Angeles City Council|City Councilman]] [[Jose Huizar]], the commission has recommended widening sidewalks, eliminating traffic lanes, constructing new parking structures, and bringing back [[streetcar]] service reminiscent of the street's past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bringingbackbroadway.com |title=Bringing Back Broadway |publisher=City of Los Angeles |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt; |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pedestrian-friendly project finished up in December 2014 that widened the sidewalks and replaced the parking lane with planters, chairs and round cafe tables with bright-red umbrellas. The Great Streets Initiative seeks to bolster the street-level health of the city by making several dozen boulevards more hospitable to pedestrians, cyclists and small businesses. Mayor [[Eric Garcetti]] said the effort represents ''"a shift from the way that our neighborhoods have been planned in Los Angeles,"'' with a new focus on ''"walkability and transit."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hawthorne |first=Christopher |date=December 6, 2014 |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-latino-immigration-architecture-20141206-story.html |title='Latino Urbanism' influences a Los Angeles in flux |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cities in Motion 2''''' is a 2013 [[business simulation game]] that was developed by [[Colossal Order (video game developer)|Colossal Order]] and published by [[Paradox Interactive]] and is the sequel to the popular mass transit simulation game ''[[Cities in Motion]]''.&lt;ref name="CiM2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.paradoxplaza.com/games/cities-in-motion-2 | title = Cities in Motion 2 | author = Paradox Interactive | date = 14 August 2012 | accessdate = 23 March 2013 | publisher = paradoxplaza.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with its predecessor, the goal of the game is to create efficient public transport systems in different major cities of the world. In this edition, there are several new features that the developers introduced based on community feedback about the previous game, including day/night cycles, rush hours and the ability to create timetables. The additions also include dynamic cities where players' decisions have a notable impact on city growth, and the inclusion of [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and competitive multi-player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.paradoxplaza.com/press/2012/8/paradox-interactive-unveils-cities-in-motion-2 | title        = Paradox Interactive Unveils Cities in Motion 2 | author = Paradox Interactive | date = 14 August 2012 | accessdate = 16 August 2012 | publisher = paradoxplaza.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{original research|date=May 2014}}
'''Continuous-flow manufacturing''', or '''Repetitive-Flow Manufacturing''', is an approach to [[discrete manufacturing]] that contrasts with [[batch production]].  It is associated with a [[Just In Time (business)|just-in-time]] and [[kanban]] production approach, and calls for an ongoing examination and improvement efforts which ultimately requires integration of all elements of the production system. The goal is an optimally balanced production line with little waste, the lowest possible cost, on-time and defect-free production.

This strategy is typically applied in [[discrete manufacturing]] as an attempt to handle production volumes comprising discrete units of product in a flow which is more naturally found in [[process manufacturing]].  The basic fact is that in most cases, discrete units of a solid product cannot be handled in the same way as continuous quantities of liquid, gas or powder.

[[Discrete manufacturing]] is more likely to be performed in batches of product units that are routed from process to process in the factory.  Each process may add value to the batch during a run-time or work-time. There is usually some time spent waiting for the process during a queue-time or wait-time.  The larger the batch, the longer each unit has to wait for the rest of the batch to be completed, before it can go forward to the next process.  This queue-time is waste, [[Muda (Japanese term)]], and represents time lost that is not value-added in the eyes of the customer.  This waste is one of the most important elements targeted for reduction and elimination in [[lean manufacturing]].

Reducing the batch size in [[discrete manufacturing]] is therefore a desirable goal: it improves the speed of response to the customer, whilst improving the ratio of value-added to non value-added work.  However, it should be balanced against the finite capacity of resources at the value-adding processes.  Capacity is consumed by [[changeover]] whenever a process is required to perform work on a different part or product model than the preceding one.  Time consumed in [[changeover]] is also considered waste, and it reduces the amount of resource capacity that is available to perform value-adding work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 =
Leone | first1 = Gerard | last2 = Rahn | first2 = Richard D | year = 2003 | title = Fundamentals of Flow Manufacturing | location = Boulder, Colo | publisher = Flow Pub | isbn = 0-9713031-8-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing batch sizes can also increase handling time, risk and complexity in planning and controlling production.

The paradigm aim is to achieve [[single-piece flow]] where a single discrete unit of product flows from process to process.  In effect, the batch quantity is one.  If there is no change in part or product model, then this objective needs to be balanced against the additional handling time, and the work-centres that perform the process will typically have to be arranged in close proximity to one another in a flow-line.  This is often a characteristic of Repetitive-flow manufacturing and most manual assembly work is performed this way in the modern factory.

If there is a change in part or product model, then the process engineer should also consider to balance the [[changeover]] time with run-time.  If the [[changeover]] time is long, as it might be on a machine, batch size reduction is typically preceded with setup reduction techniques such as [[Single-Minute Exchange of Die]].

One methodology for Repetitive-flow manufacturing is [[Demand Flow Technology]] which combines the principles of Repetitive-flow and demand-driven manufacturing.  The [[production planning and control]] is linked to a pull signal that is triggered from a customer order or consumption of finished goods stock.  A pull signal can also link a process to the down-stream, and synchronize the flow to the demand of the customer.

'''Dorothy Stokes Bostwick Smith Campbell''' (March 26, 1899 – February 16, 2001) was an American heiress and an [[art]]ist and [[author]] who became one of the first women in the [[United States]] to hold a [[helicopter]] pilot's license.

==Biography==
She was born in [[Manhattan]], the daughter of Lillian Stokes and her husband, [[Albert Carlton Bostwick]]. Her grandfather was [[Jabez A. Bostwick]], a railroad owner and wealthy co-founder of the [[Standard Oil|Standard Oil Company]].

A painter and sculptor, Dorothy Bostwick was first married at Christ Church in [[Gilbertsville, New York]] on March 7, 1922 to W. T. Sampson Smith.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1922/07/04/archives/miss-bostwick-wed-to-sampson-smith-daughter-of-mrs-fitch-gilbert-jr.html MISS BOSTWICK WED TO SAMPSON SMITH; Daughter of Mrs. Fitch Gilbert Jr - Article Preview - The New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's grandfather was the late Rear Admiral [[William T. Sampson]]. 

She was a skilled sailor and also an aviation buff in particular with the [[autogyro]], a precursor to the modern helicopter. Her second husband (m. 1950) [[Joseph Campbell (accountant)|Joseph Campbell]] was vice-president and treasurer of [[Columbia University]]. In 1954 he was appointed by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to [[Comptroller General of the United States]].

Dorothy Bostwick wrote and illustrated "''Passing Thoughts''," a collection of her own [[poetry]] and [[drawings]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4846">An '''equality impact assessment''' ('''EqIA''') is a process designed to ensure that a policy, project or scheme does not discriminate against any disadvantaged or vulnerable people.&lt;ref name=EHRC&gt;{{cite book|title=Equality impact assessment quick-start guide: A step-by-step guide to integrating equality impact assessment into policymaking and review|date=March 2010|publisher=[[Equality and Human Rights Commission]]|isbn=978 1 84206 269 2|page=3|url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/documents/PSD/equality_impact_assessment_guidance_quick-start_guide.pdf|accessdate=26 February 2016|format=PDF document|chapter=Ready: What is an equality impact assessment?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

The EqIA process aims to prevent discrimination against people who are categorised as being disadvantaged or vulnerable within society.&lt;ref name=EHRC /&gt; These categories are called equality target groups (ETGs) and are currently designated by the [[Greater London Authority]] as: 
*women; 
*black, Asian and ethnic-minority people; 
*young people and children;
*older people; 
*disabled people; 
*Lesbian people, gay people, bisexual people and transsexual people; and 
*people from different faith groups.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Previous EqIAs have included other categories of people such as people on low incomes{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} and [[gypsies]] and [[Irish Travellers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Planning policy for traveller sites: Equality impact assessment|publisher=Communities and Local Government|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11422/2116900.pdf|accessdate=26 February 2016|format=PDF document}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the UK, EqIAs are still popular as a means of ensuring that the public-sector equality duty is met.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} However, on 19 November 2012, prime minister [[David Cameron]] announced that EqIAs would no longer be undertaken for government decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20389297 BBC News].

{{Expert needed|economics|date=November 2008}}
In [[economics]] the '''generalized-Ozaki cost''' is a general description of [[cost]] described by Shuichi Nakamura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shinichiro Nakamura |title=A Nonhomothetic Generalized Leontief Cost Function Based on Pooled Data |journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics |volume=72 |issue=4 |year=1990 |pages=649–656 |doi=10.2307/2109605 |jstor=2109605 |publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For output ''y'', at date ''t'' and a vector of ''m'' input prices ''p'', the generalized-Ozaki cost, ''c'', is

: &lt;math&gt;c(p,y,t) = \sum_i b_{ii} \left( y^{b_{yi}}e^{b_{ti}t} p_i + \sum_{j\,:\,j\neq i} b_{ij} \sqrt{p_ip_j} y^{b_y} e^{b_tt}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Discussion==

In [[econometrics]] it is often desirable to have a model of the [[cost]] of [[Manufacturing|production]] of a given output with given inputs&amp;mdash;or in common terms, what it will cost to produce some number of goods at prevailing prices, or given prevailing prices and a budget, how much can be made.  Generally there are two parts to a cost function, the [[fixed costs|fixed]] and [[variable costs]] involved in production.

The [[marginal cost]] is the change in the cost of production for a single unit. Most cost functions then take the price of the inputs and adjust for different factors of production, typically, technology, economies of scale, and elasticities of inputs.

Traditional cost functions include [[Cobb–Douglas]] and the [[constant elasticity of substitution]] models. These are still used because for a wide variety of activities, effects such as varying ability to substitute materials does not change. For example, for people running a bake sale, the ability to substitute one kind of chocolate chip for another will not vary over the number of cookies they can bake. However, as economies of scale and changes in substitution become important models that handle these effects become more useful, such as the [[transcendental log cost function]].

The traditional forms are economically [[Homothetic transformation|homothetic]]. This means they can be expressed as a function, and that function can be broken into an outer part and an inner part. The inner part will appear once as a term in the outer part, and the inner part will be [[monotonically increasing]], or to say it another way, it never goes down. However, empirically in the areas of trade and production, homoethetic and monolithic functional models do not accurately predict results. One example is in the gravity equation for trade, or how much will two countries trade with each other based on GDP and distance. This led researchers to explore non-homothetic models of production, to fit with a [[cross-sectional data|cross section]] analysis of producer behavior, for example, when producers would begin to minimize costs by switching inputs, or investing in increased production.

Burgess grew up in London, England. He was educated at [[Colet Court]], [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul's School]] and then began a degree at [[Stanford University]] before dropping out to work on his business full-time. He currently lives in London.

==Early Businesses==
At 15 years old, Burgess ran his own [[eBay]] shop, becoming a powerseller and turning over £36,000 a year.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He also ran a [[videography]] company with a friend while at school, which served five schools.

==[[Gojimo]]==

In March 2013, Burgess dropped out of his undergraduate degree at [[Stanford University]] to pursue his revision apps business full-time. Later that year, he raised over $1&amp;nbsp;million in seed capital from [[Index Ventures]] and JamJar Investments (the founders of [[Innocent Drinks]]) and launched the app at [[BETT]] 2014. [[Gojimo]] is now the UK's most successful exam preparation app and is expanding around the world. The content spans mainly across the secondary school [[public exams]] syllabus in the UK and United States such as [[GCSE]] [[A Level]] and the [[SAT]].&lt;ref&gt;http://gojimo.co/exams.&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2015 the app has been installed over 500,000 times.

Burgess has grown the company from a team of two to fourteen.

==Early political career==
At the time the [[Urban Council]] elections, the only direct elections in the colony at the time, were dominated by [[Brook Bernacchi]]'s [[Reform Club of Hong Kong]], Cheong-Leen founded the [[Hong Kong Civic Association]] in 1954 with [[Roger Lobo]] and [[A. de O. Sales]], as well as Rev. [[Brigant Cassian]] and Dr. [[Woo Pak-foo]].&lt;ref name="Faure"/&gt; Cheong-Leen was the founding secretary-general of the association and was in the first meeting at a bar on the mezzanine floor of Jimmy's Kitchen in [[Theatre Lane]], [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]].&lt;ref name="HCL"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hilton Cheong-leen|date=28 July 2003|first=Hilton|last=Cheong-leen|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/423095/hilton-cheong-leen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 34 years of service, Cheong-Leen stepped down as the second longest-serving elected officeholder in Hong Kong history, behind [[Brook Bernacchi]]'s 41 years, after he decided not to seek for re-election of the Urban Council in 1991.&lt;ref name="retire"&gt;{{cite news|title=本港有史以來任期最長民選議員張有興放棄參選市局話別卅四載議員生涯|newspaper=Wah Kiu Yat Po|page=5|date=20 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lyon Gardiner Tyler Sr.''' (August 24, 1853 – February 12, 1935) was an American [[educator]], genealogist, and [[historian]].  He was the son of [[John Tyler]], 10th [[President of the United States]].  He was [[List of presidents of the College of William &amp; Mary|17th president]] of the [[College of William and Mary]], an advocate of historical research and preservation, and a prominent critic of US President [[Abraham Lincoln]].  Two of his own children are still alive, making President Tyler by far the oldest President to have living grandchildren.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
[[File:Lyon Gardiner Tylor.jpg|thumb|left|Lyon Gardiner Tyler as a young man]]

Tyler was the fourth son of President [[John Tyler]] and First Lady [[Julia Gardiner Tyler]], born at [[Sherwood Forest Plantation]]. When he was eight, his father died, and this coupled with the beginning of the [[American Civil War]] prompted the family to move north to [[Staten Island]], where his mother's family was from. He returned to Virginia in 1869 to earn both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in law from the [[University of Virginia]], graduating in 1875.  While at the University he was a member of [[Kappa Sigma]] and Jefferson Literary Society, and was recognized for his contributions to the school's literary magazine.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaVirginia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Virginia]] |title=Lyon Gardiner Tyler (1853–1935) |url= http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Tyler_Lyon_Gardiner_1853-1935 |isbn= |accessdate=2016-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduation, Tyler spent a year teaching philosophy and literature at the College of William and Mary, but as the school was struggling financially it ceased being able to pay his salary, whereupon he resigned and moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he spent several years as principal of a private school.  In 1882 he returned to Virginia to practice law in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. With the support of his mother, who lived there at the time, he began work on ''The Letters and Times of the Tylers'', a three-volume study of the careers of his father and paternal grandfather, [[John Tyler Sr.]].  This would be published between 1884 and 1896.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaVirginia"/&gt;

During his life in Richmond, Tyler became a prominent advocate for public education reform.  He helped to revive the [[Virginia Mechanics Institute]], on whose board he served and at which institution he taught.  In 1887 he was elected to the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], which gave him the opportunity to lobby for money for the College of William and Mary; he procured $10,000 to restore the school, which had lain dormant for seven years due to lack of funding and the ravages of war. This advocacy allowed the College to reopen in 1888; Tyler was named its president.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaVirginia"/&gt;

===At William and Mary===
From 1888 to 1919, Tyler served as the [[List of presidents of the College of William &amp; Mary|17th president]] of the [[College of William and Mary]] (W&amp;M); he is widely credited for restoring the college's financial condition following the deterioration which took place in the wake of the [[American Civil War]]. During his tenure he held the chairmanship of the history department, and with six other professors formed the body known as the "[[Seven Society (College of William &amp; Mary)#Tyler and The Seven Wise Men|Seven Wise Men]]". He also was responsible for the creation of the ''[[William and Mary Quarterly]]'' journal. An advocate of women's suffrage, he oversaw the College when it became the first in the Commonwealth of Virginia to admit women, in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scdbwiki.swem.wm.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Lyon_Gardiner_Tyler_(1853-1935)|title=Lyon Gardiner Tyler (1853–1935) – Special Collections Wiki|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was while at the College that Tyler became interested in the [[history of Virginia]]; he would eventually conduct research throughout the state, and campaigned for the preservation of local records.  In 1896 he managed to persuade the [[Virginia General Assembly]] to appropriate $5,000 for the copying of 17th-century court records, an action which set a precedent for the expenditure of public monies to preserve state records.  Such preservation became his mission in later years, and he traveled extensively throughout the Commonwealth to find material. In 1915 he was elected to the State Library Board, serving until his death; he was a member of the [[Virginia Historical Society]] for fifty-two years, spending forty-seven of those on its executive committee and thirty-two as a vice president. He was a prolific author, and his work spurred recognition of the significance of both [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] to American history.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaVirginia"/&gt; He also spent much of his career attempting to rehabilitate his father's political reputation.&lt;ref name="Crapol2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward P. Crapol|title=John Tyler, the Accidental President|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlbqCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17|date=18 January 2012|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-8272-6|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement and death===
Tyler resigned his presidency of William and Mary in June 1919;&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaVirginia"/&gt; during his tenure the College had increased its enrollment to over 200 pupils. The number of faculty had grown to fourteen, and twelve buildings were either renovated or constructed. The school also became a public institution, an effort which he spearheaded himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/as/history/about/index.php|title=William &amp; Mary-&amp;nbsp;The Lyon Gardiner Tyler Department of History|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired to his farm, Lion's Den, in Charles City County.  He remained active in his profession, as a writer, speaker, and researcher, until dying of pneumonia on February 12, 1935&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaVirginia"/&gt; in Richmond,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Dr. Lyon Tyler, 82, Dead in Richmond. Former Head of William and Mary |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0D16FC3859107A93C1A81789D85F418385F9 |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he is buried in [[Hollywood Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia)|Hollywood Cemetery]].

===Criticism of Abraham Lincoln===
Tyler received a deal of notoriety during his career for his criticism of [[Abraham Lincoln]], which he expressed on numerous occasions. The first of these came in 1917 when in response to an editorial in the ''[[New York Times]]'' suggesting that Southern slaveholders were akin to the German aristocrats then causing trouble in Europe, Tyler posited that it was Lincoln who more closely resembled the Prussian nobility with his flouting of the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] during the Civil War.  Eleven years later the issue arose again when the Virginia House of Delegates chose to adjourn in honor of [[Lincoln's Birthday|Lincoln's birthday]]; Tyler contended that Lincoln was no hero and did not merit the honor.  When [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] fired back that Tyler's father, compared to the later president, was a dwarf both in stature and in accomplishments, Tyler retorted with a pamphlet claiming that it was Lincoln who was the dwarf. He would go on in retirement to continue the crusade against Lincoln, publishing many articles in his own journal, ''Tyler's Quarterly and Genealogical Magazine'', that were highly critical of the sixteenth president.&lt;ref name="Lincolnwasadwarf"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0024.104/--lincoln-the-dwarf-lyon-gardiner-tylers-war-on-the-mythical?rgn=main;view=fulltext|title=Lincoln the Dwarf: Lyon Gardiner Tyler's War on the Mythical Lincoln|first=Monroe,|last=Dan|date=1 January 2003|publisher=|volume=24|issue=1|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
Tyler was married twice. His first wife was Anne Baker Tucker of [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]], with whom he had three children: John Tyler; Elizabeth Gilmer Tyler; and Julia Gardiner Tyler Wilson, one of the founders of [[Kappa Delta]].&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaVirginia"/&gt;

Following Anne's death in 1921, he married the former Sue Ruffin, 35 years his junior,&lt;ref name="Lincolnwasadwarf"/&gt; with whom he had a further three children: Lyon Gardiner Tyler, Jr. (born 1924);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franklinlionsclub.com/Tyler.html Lyon Gardiner Tyler, Jr.] from Franklin Lions Club&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison Ruffin Tyler (born 1928); and Henry Tyler, who died in infancy.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} {{As of|2018|09}}, both surviving sons from Sue are still alive, making their grandfather the earliest former President of the United States with living grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/29842/president-john-tylers-grandsons-are-still-alive|title=President John Tyler's Grandsons Are Still Alive|publisher=Mental Floss|author=John English|date=February 15, 2016|accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late August 2018, Lyon, Jr. participated in a reunion of presidential descendants hosted by the White House Historical Association, and signed, along with other descendants, a drawer from a copy of the Resolute Desk.&lt;ref name="20180831WP"&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCarthy |first1=Ellen |title=‘No one talks about that.

[[File:Tulsa Oklahoma Sister Cities Sign crop.jpg|thumb|right|sign for South Main Street, [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]]]
'''Main Street''' is a generic phrase used to denote a primary retail street of a [[village]], [[town]] or small city in many parts of the world. It is usually a focal point for [[Retailing#Shops and Stores|shop]]s and retailers in the [[central business district]], and is most often used in reference to retailing and socializing.

The term is commonly used in Ireland, Scotland, the United States, Canada, and less often in Australia and New Zealand.  In most of the United Kingdom the common description is [[High Street]] though "[[Fore Street]]" or "Front Street" is commonplace in some regions.  In [[Jamaica]] the term is Front Street.

In many places, the [[street name]] for such a street is actually "Main Street", though even where it isn't the term "Main street" is still used to describe the main thoroughfare of the central business district.  The [[U.S. Highway 66 Association|"Main Street of America"]] branding was used to promote [[U.S. Route 66]] in its heyday.

==American cultural usage==
[[File:Bastrop Texas1.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Main Street; [[Bastrop, Texas]], featuring the small shops and old-fashioned architecture typical of rural towns]]
In the general sense, the term "Main Street" refers to a place of traditional values.  Social realists from 1870 to 1930 used the name as a symbol of stifling conformity.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Ann Alexander, "Midwest Main Street in Literature: Symbol of Conformity," ''Rocky Mountain Social Science Journal'' (1968) 5#2 pp 1-12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sherwood Anderson]], for example, wrote ''[[Winesburg, Ohio]]: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small Town Life'' in 1919.  The best-selling 1920 novel ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'' was a critique of small town life, by the American writer [[Sinclair Lewis]]. The locale was "Gopher Prairie," presented as an 'ideal type' of the Midwestern town, and the heroine, Carol Kennicott, was a more urbane, 'ideal-typical' Progressive.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Jürgen Grabbe, "The Ideal Type of the Small Town: 'Main Street' in a Social Science Context," ''Amerikastudien'' (1987) 32#2 pp 181-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

In North American media of later decades, "Main Street" represents the interests of everyday people and [[small business]] owners, in contrast with "[[Wall Street]]" (in the United States) or "[[Bay Street]]" (in Canada), symbolizing the interests of large national corporations.  Thus, in the 1949 movie adaptation of [[On the Town (film)|''On The Town'']], the song "When You Walk Down Main Street With Me" refers to small-town values and social life. [[Main Street Republicans]], for example, see themselves as supporting those values as against urbane or "Wall Street" tendencies.

"Main Street" is part of the [[iconography]] of American life. For example,  the [[Army and Air Force Exchange Service]], the outfit that operates the PX and BX stores on military bases, chose the name "Main Street USA" for its food courts.

''Main Street'' was a popular term during the economic crises in 2008 and 2009: [[Proposed bailout of U.S. financial system (2008)|the proposed bailout of U.S. financial system]], the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 US presidential campaign]], and [[United States presidential election debates, 2008|debates]]. One widely reviewed book was ''Bailout: An Inside Account of How Washington Abandoned Main Street While Rescuing Wall Street'' (2012) by [[Neil Barofsky]].

In small towns across the United States, Main Street is not only the major road running through town but the site of all street life, a place where townspeople hang out and watch the annual parades go by. A slang term popularized in the early 20th century, "main drag", is also used to refer to a town's main street.

===Walt Disney===

Two [[Walt Disney Company]] [[theme park]]s, [[Disneyland]] in Anaheim, California, and the [[Magic Kingdom]] in the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] near Orlando, Florida, both have "[[Main Street, U.S.A.]]" sections immediately at their front. These areas, which are designed to look like the main street of a small town, house gift shops, restaurants and various services, along with park offices on the second floors. While the architecture of these "streets" appears to be turn-of-the-20th-century, in fact these are decorative false-fronts on [[Industrial Style|industrial-style]] buildings. Main Street, U.S.A. is also present at [[Disneyland Paris]] and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]]. At [[Tokyo Disneyland]] the area is named "World Bazaar," but has the same look as Main Street, albeit housed under a decorative glass roof for protection from Japan's unpredictable weather.

Disney's design copied visual elements of small-town America seen in films by [[Frank Capra]] and others, in a deliberate attempt to capture the iconic symbolism of small-town America. Disney wanted to embed the values and memories associated with life in small towns into an entertainment experience for tourists.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Neuman, "Disneyland's Main Street, USA, and its Sources in Hollywood, USA," ''Journal of American Culture'' (2008) 31#1 pp 83-97, online&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preservation and Main Street===
[[National Trust for Historic Preservation#National Trust Main Street Center|Main Street Inc.]] is the name of a community revitalization program begun by the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] in the late 1970s. The core of the Main Street philosophy is the preservation of the historic built environment by engaging in [[historic preservation]]. Main Street focuses on a holistic approach to revitalization based on the 4-point approach of design, promotion, economic restructuring, and organization. Originally targeted at small, traditional downtowns, the program has expanded to include towns of various sizes, including neighborhood districts in several large urban centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainstreet.org/|title=Home Page|date=2009-04-09|work=Main Street|publisher=National Main Street Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many communities, a merchants' association or [[business improvement district]] serves a promotional role on behalf of the merchants of a downtown Main Street. Individual city governments also may engage in revitalisation or historic preservation efforts to support a downtown core, either to make a community appear more attractive for [[tourism]] or to stem a flow of commerce out of the city into [[suburb]]s with [[shopping mall]]s and cookie-cutter [[big box store]]s.

In the [[United States of America|United States]] federal funds are allocated specifically for restoration of historic properties on the former [[U.S. Route 66]], the main street of many roadside towns; this funding is administered by the US [[National Park Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/route66/listofsites66.html|title=Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary: Route 66|publisher=US [[National Park Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International use and equivalents ==

* Many small Canadian cities and towns have a thoroughfare named Main Street (or, in French, ''Rue principale''); in other cases, the main street of the community has a name particular to that community. The phrase "a town where the main street is still called Main Street" is occasionally used as being synonymous with small-town values.
** In [[Ottawa]], main streets of various individual [[village]]s which had been annexed to the larger urban municipality bear names like "Manotick Main" or "Osgoode Main" to distinguish them from Smyth Road (which becomes "Main Street" in one small area southeast of downtown Ottawa) and from each other. The actual main street of centretown Ottawa is [[Bank Street (Ottawa)|Bank Street]].
** In [[Toronto]], Main Street is a mostly residential avenue in the [[East York]] district.&lt;ref name=ShapingToronto/&gt;&lt;ref name=RailsAcross/&gt;&lt;ref name=MikeFileyTheWayWeWere2008/&gt; At one time it was the main street of the hamlet of [[East Toronto]], which was annexed by the city of Toronto in 1908. It has kept its historic name, and evidence of its commercial origins can be seen in the stores at the corner of Main and Gerrard Streets. Toronto's main street is considered to be [[Yonge Street]], which divides the city's latitudinal streets into east-west.
** [[Saint Laurent Boulevard]], which divides [[Montreal]] between east and west, is unofficially known as "the Main." 
** Main Street in [[Vancouver]] is a neighbourhood shopping street, near the dividing line between east and west side of town. However, the city's main city centre shopping street is Robson Street.
* In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], smaller urban centres often have a main street. In some towns this street is officially designated Main Street or High Street; rarer variants include Main Road, Commercial Road, and Commerce Street. Often, though, the street is given a name peculiar to the town. For many small towns, the main street forms part of the principal road into, or through, the town. Large centres often have a [[central business district]] in which no one street is a clear focus for commercial activity, though for historical or cultural reasons there is often one street regarded as the city's "main street". Examples include [[Melbourne]]'s [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]], [[Sydney]]'s [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]], [[Adelaide]]'s King William Street, [[Auckland]]'s Queen Street, and [[Christchurch]]'s [[Colombo Street]].
* In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] most towns have a "main street", and this is usually the term given colloquially (for example, in offering road directions), though the primary thoroughfare of cities are often named after an historical figure, e.g. [[O'Connell Street]]. A more recent phenomenon in the media and with younger people is the misapplication of the term "high street" to describe typical or average street level fashion&amp;mdash;likely due to advertising by various British retail multiples which began operating in Ireland during the "Celtic Tiger" years.
* In [[England]], the terms "Market Street" or "Market Place" are often used to designate the heart of a town or city,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} as is the more common High Street (particularly in newer urban developments, or towns or cities which were not original market towns). [[High Street]] is often the name of a fairly busy street with small shops on either side, often in towns and villages.
* In [[Germany]], the [[Hauptstraße (allgemein)|Hauptstraße]] (literally "Main Street") is a highly trafficked street. Hauptstraßen even have formal recognition in road construction guidelines, which specify the width of lanes, for example. The term chiefly refers to motorized traffic, whereas "Einkaufsstraße" (shopping street) or "Fußgängerzone" (pedestrian district) refer to retail in the sense of Engl. "Main Street".
* In [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]], almost all towns and cities have their own main street, a street called ''Storgatan''/''Storgaten'' (literally, "The big street"). They are typically surrounded by stores and restaurants, and increasingly since the late-20th century open for [[pedestrian]]s only. Likewise, in both [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] this type of street is called ''gågata''/''gågate'' (literally, "walkingstreet").
* In most [[Comune|Italian municipalities]], the highway or another major route is called ''Via [[Rome|Roma]]''. This was done at the behest of [[Benito Mussolini]], who gave the order in 1939 to commemorate the [[March on Rome]].
* ''[[Jalan Besar]]'' (roughly translated from [[Malay language|Malay]] as "Main Road") is a common street name used in [[Malaysia]] (and to a more limited extent, [[Singapore]]) when referring to main streets of older urban centres in the country. Such main streets were originally constructed during British colonisation of territories in present-day Malaysia and Singapore, and were named in English as "Main Street" or "Main Road", depending on the size and nature of the urban centre, and often are laid out as parts of major thoroughfares between larger towns and cities.
** The independence of states that would form Malaysia and the introduction of the [[Malay language]] as the country's national language in 1967 led to extensive renaming of certain Main Streets or Main Roads to "''Jalan Besar''" in Malaysia the following decades. Large cities (such as [[List of capitals in Malaysia|state capitals]]) tend to forgo the use of "Main Street" or "Main Road" altogether as commercial or transport activity may be concentrated along more than one street.
* In [[South Africa]], Main Road is the term used for the same concept as Main Street in the U.S. and High Street in the UK.
* In [[Rural Khmer house|Cambodia]], the Main Road is between the Rice fields and settlements.
* In [[Industrial engineering|Industrial Engineering]], "Main Street" is often used to describe a conveyor which transports the fundamental materials for producing objects to the automated construction site where the intended object will be assembled.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1724">[[Image:Mdfa logo.jpg|right]]The '''Men's Dress Furnishings Association''' was a trade association based in [[New York, New York]] which promoted men's fashion accessories with a primary focus on [[dress shirt]]s and [[necktie]]s.  The group also educated consumers at high schools and colleges.

Founded in 1947 as the Men's Tie Foundation, they changed their name to the Neckwear Association of America in 1978. In 2003, due to a decline in its membership as a result of manufacturers closing, consolidating, or losing business to overseas competition, the Association added dress shirt manufacturers to boost their membership and became the Men's Dress Furnishings Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2008/06/brief-history-necktie-through-ages|title=Brief history of the necktie through the ages|last=STEELE|first=VALERIE|date=June 11, 2008|work=Wall Street Journal|pages=A1|accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group announced in 2008 that it was shutting down after 60 years.   Membership in the group had declined from a high of 120 manufacturers in the 1980s to 25 in 2008.  Increased competition from manufacturers outside the United States as well as the declining number of men wearing ties was cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121253690573743197?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Tie Association, a Fashion Victim, Calls It Quits as Trends Change|last=SMITH|first=RAY A.|date=June 4, 2008|work=Wall Street Journal|pages=A1|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

opened their Pryor / MidAmerica clinic at MidAmerica Industrial Park on January 19, 2009. Independently owned, UCGC was founded in 2002 by Dr. Stephen R. Kovacs, D.O., F.A.B.H.P. and Dr. S.Addison Beeson, D.O., F.A.B.E.P. The {{convert|4400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility includes a reception area, doctor's office, eight exam / treatment rooms, EMR (Electronic Medical Records), in-house x-ray, orthopedics and lab services. The clinic will treat employees from MidAmerica industries and area businesses that require occupational health services such as: in-depth diagnostic and treatment for most occupational injuries; drug testing; employee physicals; and, sports physicals. Additionally, UCGC offers “walk-in treatment” with no appointment necessary for the general public from throughout Mayes County. 

'''Tulsa Life Flight''', [http://www.tulsalifeflight.com/] a helicopter ambulance service formerly based solely at Saint Francis Hospital in Tulsa, will open a second base of operations at MidAmerica Industrial Park’s airport.  Tulsa Life Flight was established in 1979. It was the thirteenth helicopter air ambulance to be established in the US and the first in Oklahoma. To date, Tulsa Life Flight has completed more than 42,200 accident free flights which is a record held only by a few programs in the world. The aircraft are owned and operated by Air Methods Corporation, the largest air ambulance corporation in the world. The firm contracts with Saint Francis Hospital to provide aircraft, pilots and mechanics. 

The MidAmerica Industrial park is also home to a branch of [[Oklahoma State University–Okmulgee|OSU Institute of Technology]], which has some of the classes that OSU Institute of Technology provides. The [[MidAmerica Industrial Park Airport]] is also located in the park.

MidAmerica publishes a quarterly newsletter called MidPoint to share "news, views and other information" about the park and the industries that we serve. A complimentary subscription is available to individuals who are involved in site selection decision making for their respective companies.

==New leadership==
In November 2012, Oklahoma Governor [[Mary Fallin]] appointed David Stewart as the chief administrative officer of the Oklahoma Ordnance Works Authority (OOWA). He succeeded Sanders Mitchell, who had headed the authority for 35 years before retiring. Stewart was formerly president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Cherokee Nation Businesses LLC and the wholly owned parent/holding company of the Cherokee Nation, which is charged with the economic development and business diversification across the Cherokee Nation's business entities.&lt;ref&gt;McNutt, Michael.

He was promoted to the position of general manager for OOWA in 1990, following the death of the original chief administrative office, board member and founder of the Mid-America Industrial Park, Gene R. Redden, who served in this capacity from its inception in 1961 until his death in 1990. {{efn|Redden had come to OOWA in 1947 as its first general manager.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4807">In [[quality management]], a '''nonconformity''' (sometimes referred to as a '''defect''') is a deviation from a [[Specification (technical standard)|specification]], a [[Technical standard|standard]], or an [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]. Nonconformities can be classified in seriousness multiple ways, though a typical classification scheme may have three to four levels, including critical, serious, major, and minor.&lt;ref name="HoyleISO09"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWNWdBisJcoC&amp;pg=PA691 |chapter=36. Corrective Action |title=ISO 9000 Quality Systems Handbook: Using the Standards as a Framework for Business Improvement |author=Hoyle, D. |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |pages=687–704 |isbn=9781856176842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BergerTheCert07"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bYsth3j8eQC&amp;pg=PA188 |chapter=Chapter 22 B.

While some situations allow "nonconformity" and "defect" to be used synonymously, some industries distinguish between the two; a nonconformity represents a failure to meet an intended state and specification, while a defect represents a failure to meet fitness for use/normal usage requirements.&lt;ref name="BergerTheCert07" /&gt; This can be seen in the international software engineering standard ISO/IEC 25010 (formerly [[ISO/IEC 9126]]), which defines a nonconformity as the nonfulfillment of a requirement and a [[Product defect|defect]] as the nonfulfillment of intended usage requirements.&lt;ref name="ISO25010"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/35733.html |title=ISO/IEC 25010:2011 Systems and software engineering -- Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) -- System and software quality models |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |date=March 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifying nonconformity==
When ensuring [[Quality (business)|quality]] of a product or a service, classification of a nonconformity is important, as it provides an opportunity to better reduce nonconformity.&lt;ref name="HoyleISO09" /&gt; Many quality management practices will do this using a relatively simple three- or four-level classification system.&lt;ref name="BergerTheCert07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MitraFundamentals16" /&gt;For example, U.S. federal agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have used a simple three-tier system for quality requirements of government-acquired supplies and services: minor, major, and critical nonconformance.&lt;ref name="GSAFAR05"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/current/far/pdf/FAR.pdf |format=PDF |title=Federal Acquisition Regulation |volume=1 |publisher=General Services Administration |page=46.103 |date=March 2005 |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some industries may develop their own, custom ranking systems. An example from the [[automotive industry]] uses a 10-point system for finer granularity, where, for example, a one represents "none" (no effect), a six "moderate" (vehicle or item operable, but comfort or convenience items inoperable), and a 10 "hazardous without warning" (when a potential failure mode affects safe vehicle operation without warning).&lt;ref name="HoyleISO09" /&gt; Regardless of size, these classification schemes exist to help drive discovery and correction of nonconformities (and defects).&lt;ref name="HoyleISO09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MitraFundamentals16" /&gt;

==Sources of nonconformity==
The causes of nonconformities aren't unlimited and therefore determinable. Common causes for deficiencies to arise include&lt;ref name="HoyleISO09" /&gt;:

* poor communication (or miscommunication)
* poor documentation (or lack of documentation)
* poor or limited training of personnel
* poor motivation of personnel
* poor quality materials (or lack of appropriate materials)
* poor quality tools and equipment (or lack of appropriate tools and equipment)
* poor or dysfunctional operating environment

The plant-based vaccine production method works by isolating a specific antigen protein, one that triggers a human immune response from the targeted virus. A gene from the protein is transferred to bacteria, which are then used to “infect” plant cells. The plants then start producing the exact protein that will be used for vaccinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/02/darpa-funded-researchers-tobacco-vs-viral-terror/ | work=Wired | first=Katie | last=Drummond | title=Darpa-funded Researchers: Tobacco vs. Viral Terror | date=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses of plant-expressed vaccines including the successful creation of edible bananas that protect against the [[Norwalk virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/02/darpa-funded-researchers-tobacco-vs-viral-terror/#ixzz0vqkU1NqL | work=Wired | first=Katie | last=Drummond | title=Darpa-funded Researchers: Tobacco vs. Viral Terror | date=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raschig rings''' are pieces of tube, approximately equal in length and diameter, used in large numbers as a [[packed bed]] within columns for [[distillation column|distillation]]s and other [[chemical engineering]] processes. They are usually ceramic or metal and provide a large surface area within the volume of the column for interaction between liquid and gas vapours. Raschig rings are named after their inventor, the German chemist [[Friedrich Raschig]].&lt;ref name=Sella&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andrea Sella | year = 2008 | work = Chemistry World | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = 83 | title = Raschig's Rings | url = http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2008/September/RaschigsRings.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Product description: Ceramic Raschig Ring|url=http://www.chemicalpackings.com/product/ceramic-raschig-ring.html|website=LianChuang|date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
They form what is now known as random packing, and enabled Raschig to perform distillations of much greater efficiency than his competitors using [[fractional distillation]] columns with trays.&lt;ref name=Sella/&gt; 

In a distillation column, the [[reflux]] or condensed vapour runs down the column, covering the surfaces of the rings, while vapour from the [[reboiler]] goes up the column.  As the vapour and liquid pass each other countercurrently in a small space, they tend towards equilibrium. Thus, less volatile material tends to go downwards, and more volatile material upwards.  

They are also used for devices where gas and liquid are put in contact for purposes of gas absorption, stripping or chemical reaction, and as a support for [[biofilm]]s in biological reactors.

Raschig rings made from [[borosilicate glass]] are sometimes employed in the handling of nuclear materials, where they are used inside vessels and tanks containing solutions of fissile material, for example solutions of enriched [[uranyl nitrate]], acting as neutron absorbers and preventing a potential [[criticality accident]].&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/Miscellaneous/raschigrings.htm Oak Ridge Associated Universities] Raschig Rings for Criticality Control (1980s)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==
Given the success of the simply-shaped Raschig ring, there have been many other forms developed in an attempt to either improve upon it, or to avoid patents for particular designs.

=== Pall ring ===
The Pall ring attempts to increase the useful aspects of packing, by giving an increased number of edges to disrupt flow, whilst also reducing the volume taken up by the ring packing medium itself. Rather than using a solid-walled tube, the Pall ring resembles an open basket structure of thin bars. These form both a tube and also a radial structure of cross bars.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web

  |website=Raschig-Jaeger Technologies
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pall rings may be injection moulded of plastics, moulded of ceramics or press-formed from metal sheet.

=== Super ring ===
The Raschig 'Super Ring' represents a further development of the same concepts behind the Pall ring. It optimises the production of turbulent film-type flows and prevents the formation of drops.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web

  |website=Raschig-Jaeger Technologies
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'rings' no longer resemble rings but are pressed from metal sheet in the form of wave shapes of narrow strips. Super rings appeared in 1995 and have been developed through several improved generations since.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Research Triangle Park''' ('''RTP''') is the largest [[Science park|research park]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="AboutRTP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rtp.org/|title=The Research Triangle Park |publisher=Rtp.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medcitynews.com/2010/08/minneapolis-to-host-annual-conference-of-university-research-parks/ |title=Minneapolis to host annual conference of university research parks |publisher=MedCity News |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2013-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ocga/testimony/Research_Parks_and_Job_Creation.asp |title=Research Parks and Job Creation: Innovation Through Cooperation |publisher=.nationalacademies.org |date=2009-12-09 |accessdate=2013-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is named for the three hub cities of [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], and [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], or more properly for the three major research universities in those three cities ([[NC State University]], [[Duke University]], and the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] respectively).  The [[Research Triangle]] region of [[North Carolina]] received its name as an extension of the name of the park.  Besides the three anchor cities, the park is also bounded by the communities of [[Morrisville, North Carolina|Morrisville]] and [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]]. Approximately one fourth of the park's territory lies in [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]], but the majority of its land is in [[Durham County, North Carolina|Durham County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waywelivednc.com/maps/historical/rtp.pdf|title=Research Triangle Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Scott Levitan was named the organization's new President and CEO, making him the 9th leader since the foundation was established.

== History ==
Following World War II, North Carolina's economy could no longer depend upon their traditional industries of agriculture, textiles, and furniture; their market share was in decline and jobs were leaving. Academics at N.C. State and Duke came up with the idea of creating the park so that the universities could do research together, leverage the area's strengths, and keep graduates in state.&lt;ref name="Our State Magazine"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ourstate.com/research-triangle-park/|title=The Man and Plan Behind Research Triangle Park – Our State Magazine|date=2014-08-25|work=Our State Magazine|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1951 and located in North Carolina, Research Triangle Park was created to increase innovation in the area. It is bordered by Duke University, North Carolina State University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. At first, the park struggled to recruit innovators, but in 1965, Research Triangle Park saw its largest surge of growth, thanks to heavy recruiting by the state's government and Archibald (Archie) Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Link|first=Albert N.|last2=Scott|first2=John T.|date=2003|title=The Growth of Research Triangle Park|jstor=40229257|journal=Small Business Economics|volume=20|issue=2|pages=167–175|doi=10.2307/40229257}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their article "The Growth of Research Triangle Park," Link and Scott posit that entrepreneurial culture and, especially, leadership contributed the most to its success as a cluster. Archie Davis promoted a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship by locating the park near universities, actively recruiting organizations (like the American Academy of Arts and Sciences), and used his vision to raise funding for the park.

Davis strongly believed that profits could not be the only driver for creating the park - the betterment of the community should be the key goal. "The love of this state … was the motivation for the Research Triangle idea," he said. "Research Triangle is a manifestation of what North Carolina is all about." Research Triangle Park remains a nonprofit.&lt;ref name="Our State Magazine"/&gt;

==Local government==
The park is an [[unincorporated area]], and state law prohibits municipalities from annexing areas within the park.&lt;ref&gt;"Could RDU do more for Durham?", Raleigh News &amp; Observer, 13-Sept-2009, p.13A&lt;/ref&gt; Some local government functions are served by the Durham-Wake Counties Research and Production Service District, a special tax district created in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.durham-nc.com/resources/pdf/tourmap_drive.pdf|title=Self-Driving Tour of Research Triangle Park|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401085734/http://www.durham-nc.com/resources/pdf/tourmap_drive.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://godoggo.org/files/maps/rtp.pdf|title=The Research Triangle Park Jogging &amp; Pedestrian Trails}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is conterminous with the park, wherein the property tax rate is limited to 10 cents per $100 valuation.&lt;ref name="thertpblog.org"&gt;{{cite web |author=Choose RTP Park Life About RTP Contact Us Blog |url=http://thertpblog.org/2012/07/31/master-plan-update-legislative-changes-approved/ |title=Master Plan Update: Legislative Changes Approved |publisher=The RTP Blog |date=2012-07-31 |accessdate=2013-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819041459/http://thertpblog.org/2012/07/31/master-plan-update-legislative-changes-approved/ |archivedate=2012-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The park has special zoning as a Research Applications District in the Wake County portion, and a Scientific Research Park in the Durham County portion.

==Master Plan, Redevelopment, and Park Center==
On October 1, 2015, former President and CEO of the Research Triangle Foundation, Bob Geolas, announced RTP's plans for a $50 million redevelopment involving the formation of "Park Center." $20 million will be allocated from Durham County, $10 million from the Durham-Wake Counties Research and Production Service District, and $20 million as a result of land purchases and site work provided by the Research Triangle Foundation of North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RTP Reveals Park Center Plan - The Research Triangle Park|url = https://www.rtp.org/rtp-reveals-park-center-plan/|website = The Research Triangle Park|access-date = 2016-01-29|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park Center is to be over 300,000 square feet of public space at the heart of the Research Triangle Park. This public area will include retail outlets, food and beverage venues, and entertainment space. Geolas states that "We want to make all of this as local as possible. I would like to have as few chains, no chains if we could. I'd love for it all to be local. Local coffee, local food, local produce, local products."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Park Center Redevelopment|url = https://www.rtp.org/about-us/park-center/|website = The Research Triangle Park|access-date = 2016-01-29|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redevelopment plans also include exploring partnerships with regional transit groups. The hope of the Research Triangle Foundation is to broaden public transportation to and from the area. According to Geolas, "We are currently having discussions about bringing the Regional Transit Center over to Park Center so that we can connect with all of our transit links." A public commuter rail is also in talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RTP Announces $50M for Park Center Development|url = https://vimeo.com/141200953|website = Vimeo|access-date = 2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsidiaries of The Research Triangle Park Foundation ==
The Research Triangle Park Foundation operates three buildings within RTP. These three buildings are The Frontier, The Lab, and The Archie K. Davis Conference Center. The Frontier is a collaboration space that was first opened in January 2015. Since its inception, over 20,000 visitors have come through The Frontier's doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtp.org/about-us/the-frontier/|title=The Frontier|website=The Research Triangle Park|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lab is a full-service lab and office space that houses multiple [[Research and development|Research and Development]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtp.org/about-us/thelab/|title=The Lab - The Research Triangle Park|website=The Research Triangle Park|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archie K.

The AKD Conference Center is also home to the Research Triangle Park Foundation main offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtp.org/events/reserve-conference-room/|title=About The AKD Conference Center - The Research Triangle Park|website=The Research Triangle Park|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salmon Oliver Levinson''' (1865 – 1941) was a practicing attorney who specialized in industrial organizations and corporate law.  He was active in the [[Peace_movement#United_States|peace movement]] in the nineteen-twenties and was responsible for drafting the [[Kellogg–Briand Pact]], signed in 1928.  Levinson noted: "We should have, not as now, laws of war, but laws against war; just as there are no laws of murder or of poisoning, but laws against them.” The treaty was the first international agreement to make war illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Menand|first1=Louis|title=What Happens When War Is Outlawed|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/18/what-happens-when-war-is-outlawed|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=25 October 2017|date=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=i3&gt;[[#Internationalists|Hathaway &amp; Shapiro]], p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty commits the parties to "condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies, and renounce it, as an instrument of national policy" and agree that all disputes should be settled peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/kbpact.asp | title = Kellogg-Briand Pact 1928 | publisher = [[Yale University]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Lowther Jackson Jr.''' (February 3, 1825 – March 26, 1890) was an American politician and jurist who served as [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia]] prior to the [[American Civil War]], and later served as a general in the [[Confederate States Army]].

==Early life==

===Paternal ancestry===
William L. Jackson was a cousin of [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson]] through their great-grandparents, John Jackson (1715 or 1719 – 1801) and Elizabeth Cummins (also known as Elizabeth Comings and Elizabeth Needles) (1723–1828). John Jackson was a Protestant (Ulster-Scottish) from [[Coleraine]], [[County Londonderry]], Ireland. While living in London, England, he was convicted of the capital crime of larceny for stealing £170; the judge at the [[Old Bailey]] sentenced him to seven years of [[Indentured servitude in the Americas|indentured servitude in America]]. Elizabeth, a strong, blonde woman over {{convert|6|ft|cm}} tall, born in London, England was also convicted of larceny in an unrelated case for stealing 19 pieces of silver, jewelry, and fine lace, and received a similar sentence. They both were transported on the prison ship ''Litchfield'', which departed London in May 1749 with 150 convicts. John and Elizabeth met on board and were in love by the time the ship arrived at [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. Although they were sent to different locations in Maryland for their indentures, the couple married in July 1755.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 1997, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The family migrated west across the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] to settle near [[Moorefield, West Virginia|Moorefield, Virginia]] (now [[West Virginia]]) in 1758. In 1770, they moved farther west to the [[Tygart Valley River|Tygart Valley]]. They began to acquire large parcels of virgin farming land near the present-day town of [[Buckhannon, West Virginia|Buckhannon]], including 3,000 acres (12&amp;nbsp;km²) in Elizabeth's name. John and his two teenage sons, were early recruits for the [[American Revolutionary War]], fighting in the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] on October 7, 1780; John finished the war as [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] and served as a [[lieutenant]] of the [[Virginia militia]] after 1787. While the men were in the Army, Elizabeth converted their home to a haven, "Jackson's Fort," for refugees from Indian attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 1997, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

John and Elizabeth had eight children. Their eldest son, [[George Jackson (Virginia politician)|George Jackson]] (1757–1831), was a colonel in the [[Virginia militia]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] from Virginia. George and his wife, Elizabeth Brake (1757–1812), daughter of Jacob and Mary E. (née Cooper) Brake, had three children; their youngest was William's father, William Lowther Jackson Sr. (1798–1836), who also served in the Virginia militia.

===Childhood and prewar career===
Jackson was born on February 3, 1825 in [[Clarksburg, West Virginia|Clarksburg, Virginia]] (now West Virginia). Studying law he was admitted to the Bar of Virginia in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wickline|first1=John|title=The Other Gen. Jackson: William Lowther 'Mudwall' Jackson|url=http://www.connect-clarksburg.com/connect.cfm?func=view&amp;section=Famous-People&amp;item=The-Other-Gen-Jackson-William-Lowther-Mudwall-Jackson-2849|website=Connect-Clarksburg|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Sarah Elizabeth Creel on December 19, 1849, and together they had two or three children. Jackson was a big man, standing about six feet tall and weighing about 200 pounds. He had a shock of dark red hair and piercing blue eyes like those of his famous cousin, Thomas Jackson. William Jackson was not known as an eloquent speaker, but he was known as a forceful one.&lt;ref name=Rantigns&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wittenberg|first1=Eric J.|title=Brig. Gen. William L. "Mudwall" Jackson|url=http://civilwarcavalry.com/?p=2962|website=Rantings of a Civil War Historian|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later became the [[Commonwealth's Attorney]] for [[Harrison County, West Virginia|Harrison County]]. Entering politics he was elected into the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] two times, also serving as Second Auditor of the State and as superintendent of the state library fund. Jackson was the third [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia]] from 1857 until 1860 and afterwards was made a  circuit judge in the 19th district.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 2004, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War==
[[File:William L. Jackson.jpg|thumb|left|Jackson during the civil war.]]
When the civil war erupted Jackson, a proponent of slavery, resigned from his position as judge and enlisted in the [[Confederate States Army]] as a Private. Recommended to General [[Robert E. Lee]] he quickly was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel of the [[31st Virginia Infantry|31st Virginia Infantry Regiment]]. Assigned to the command of Gen. [[Robert S. Garnett]] he participated in the [[Western Virginia Campaign]] and the battles of [[Battle of Rich Mountain|Rich Mountain]] and [[Battle of Cheat Mountain|Cheat Mountain]]. In July 1861 he was promoted to rank of Colonel. In early 1862 he became a Volunteer [[Aide-de-camp]] to his cousin, Maj. Gen. [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]]; and participated in his campaigns during the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Webb|first1=Kerry|title=Jackson, William Lowther "Mudwall"|url=http://grapevine.com.au/~kwebb/cong_j.html|website=Confederate Generals - J|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eicher&gt;Eicher, 2001, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

William's younger brother George, who was a graduate of [[West Point]] (Class of 1856) and served in the U.S. Army, became a colonel in the Confederate Army, too.

In February 1863 William Jackson was authorized to organize a mounted regiment for service behind the enemy lines and he raised the [[19th Virginia Cavalry]]. His regiment immediately joined the [[Jones-Imboden Raid]], first under command of [[Albert G. Jenkins]], then under [[John D. Imboden]]. Jackson stayed in western Virginia, being assigned to command a cavalry brigade. He fought at the [[Battle of Bulltown|Bulltown]] and confronted [[George Crook]]'s Union Army on its return into West Virginia following Crook's victory at the [[Battle of Cloyd's Mountain]]. In 1864 he joined Lt. Gen. [[Jubal Early]] in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|Valley Campaigns]] from May to October. He received his promotion to brigadier general on December 19, 1864.&lt;ref name="Eicher"/&gt;

On April 15, 1865, six days after Gen. Lee surrendered the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Court House]], he disbanded his brigade. Refusing to surrender, he headed westwards, finally getting a parole in [[Brownsville, Texas]], on July 26, 1865.&lt;ref name="Rantigns"/&gt;

==Later life==
Temporarily emigrating to Mexico, he returned to what was now [[Western Virginia]] just to learn that former Confederate officers were barred from practicing law in the state. He then moved to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where he was allowed to resume his practice of law. Jackson became a circuit judge again and kept this position for his remaining life. He died on March 26, 1890 of [[Bright's disease]] in Louisville; and was interred there on [[Cave Hill Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="Rantigns"/&gt;

==Nickname controversy==
William L. Jackson is one of three Confederate generals associated with the nickname "Mudwall", a reference to the "Stonewall" nickname given to his cousin Thomas. While William Jackson has been known as such for a long time, it was found by noted historian Garry W. Gallagher that the nickname was originally given to fellow Confederate General [[Alfred E. Jackson]] from Tennessee (no family relation). It seems the two were mixed up in the [[Southern Historical Society Papers]] in 1906 and the error was involuntarily repeated afterwards. Sometimes the name is even attributed to another (likewise not related) Confederate Brigadier, [[John K. Jackson]]. It is also possible that at times the name was attributed to several of the Jacksons simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You Know of " Old Stonewall " Meet " Old Mudwall " Jackson|url=http://civilwartalk.com/threads/you-know-of-old-stonewall-meet-old-mudwall-jackson.74415/|website=Civil War Talk|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walden, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3907">'''Work Improvement in Small Enterprises (WISE)''' is a practical programme developed by the [[International Labour Organization]] for improvement of [[occupational health and safety]] conditions - in particular small and medium-sized enterprises ([[Small and medium enterprises|SME]]s).  It is a highly pragmatic approach that focus on simple low-cost interventions which improve both [[labor productivity]] and work conditions at the same time.  A complete training package with an action manual and a trainers' manual is available from the ILO.

The programme has found particular use in developing economies.

The programme was originally launched as a [[PIACT]] activity in 1976.

'''Yury Valentinovich Kovalchuk''' ({{lang-ru|Юрий Валентинович Ковальчук}}, born 25 July 1951) is a Russian [[billionaire]] businessman and financier who is "reputed to be [[Vladimir Putin]]'s personal banker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rfe.rferl.org/newsline/2008/03/1-RUS/rus-070308.asp|title=Russians make leap forward on global billionaires' list|publisher=[[Radio Liberty]]|date=7 March 2008|accessdate=10 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The May 2008 issue of Russian ''[[Forbes]]'' listed him for the first time in its ''Golden Hundred'' of Russia's richest, calling him and another new entrant to the ''List'', [[Gennady Timchenko]], "good acquaintances of Vladimir Putin."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/sphereNews/idUSL234792120080423?sp=true&amp;view=sphere Kremlin-linked tycoon eyes Russia media firm-report] [[Reuters|reuters.com]] 23 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine placed him at number 53 on the Russians-only list, with an estimated fortune of $1.9 billion.

From 1987 to 1991 he was the first deputy director of [[Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute]]. Since 2004 he has been chair of [[Rossiya Bank]] and its largest shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2005/03/01/88331 Anna Shcherbakova.

Since the early 1990s Kovalchuk has owned a [[dacha]] in Solovyovka in the [[Priozersky District]] of the [[Leningrad Oblast|Leningrad region]], located on the eastern shore of the Komsomolskoye lake on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] near St. Petersburg. His neighbours there are [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Vladimir Yakunin]], [[Andrei Aleksandrovich Fursenko|Andrei Fursenko]], [[Sergey Fursenko]], [[Viktor Myachin]], [[Vladimir Smirnov (businessman)|Vladimir Smirnov]] and [[Nikolay Shamalov]]. Together they instituted the co-operative society [[Ozero]] (the Lake) which united their properties on 10 November 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/how-the-1980s-explains-vladimir-putin/273135/#  How the 1980s Explains Vladimir Putin.

His elder brother [[Mikhail Kovalchuk]] is the scientific secretary of the Council for Science and High Technologies attached to the president of the [[Russian Federation]].

In 2015 Yury Kovalchuk's National Media Group (NMG) and US Discovery channel joined forces to form Media Alliance  of which NMG owns 80% &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/billionaire-kovalchuks-national-media-group-to-buy-russian-distributor-of-cnn-51323|title=Billionaire Kovalchuk's National Media Group to Buy Russian Distributor of CNN|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Later that year, Kovalchuk acquired the rights to Ted Turner’s Russian assets including the Russian version of CNN, Cartoon Network and Boomerang. The reason for the sale was based on the Russian media ownership law that limits ownership of Russian media by foreigners. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eurasianbusinessbriefing.com/billionaire-kovalchuk/|title=‘Putin’s personal banker’ Kovalchuk to buy CNN Russia as Turner moves out|date=2015-12-24|work=Eurasian Business Briefing - Information for Investors|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Kovalchuk purchased the century-old Novy Svet vineyard in the Crimean Peninsula for $26.4 million in one of the first privatization deals in the region since the annexation of the region by Russia. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/putin-ally-targeted-by-us-sanctions-buys-winery-in-crimea-60001|title=Putin Ally Targeted by U.S. Sanctions Buys Winery in Crimea|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanctions==
Kovalchuk was one of several individuals sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department on 20 March 2014 in response to the [[2014 Crimean crisis]].
