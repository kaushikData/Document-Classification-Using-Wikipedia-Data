In the [[19th century]], the philosophies of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] began to have a dramatic effect, the landmark works of philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] influencing new generations of thinkers. In the late 18th century a movement known as [[Romanticism]] began; it validated strong emotion as an authentic not of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as trepidation, horror and terror and awe. Key ideas that sparked changes in philosophy were the fast progress of science; [[evolution]], as postulated by [[Lucilio Vanini|Vanini]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo|Lord Monboddo]], [[Erasmus Darwin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], and [[Charles Darwin]]; and what might now be called [[Emergence|emergent]] order, such as the [[free market]] of [[Adam Smith]] within nation states. Pressures for [[egalitarianism]], and more rapid change culminated in a period of revolution and turbulence that would see philosophy change as well.

== Brief historical outline ==
With the tumultuous years of 1789–1815, European culture was transformed by revolution, war and disruption. By ending many of the social and cultural props of the previous century, the stage was set for dramatic economic and political change. European philosophy reflected on, participated in, and drove, many of these changes.

=== Influences from the late Enlightenment ===
The last third of the 18th century produced a host of ideas and works which would both systematize previous philosophy, and present a deep challenge to the basis of how philosophy had been systematized. [[Immanuel Kant]] is a name that most would mention as being among the most important of influences, as is [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. While both of these philosophers were products of the 18th century and its assumptions, they pressed at the boundaries. In trying to explain the nature of the state and government, Rousseau would challenge the basis of government with his declaration that "Man is born free, but is everywhere in chains". Kant, while attempting to preserve axiomic skepticism, was forced to argue that we do not see true reality, nor do we speak of it. All we know of reality is appearances. Since all we can see of reality is appearances, which are subject to certain necessary and subjective forms of perceptions, Kant postulates the idea of an unknowable (while at the same time limiting our use of science and the principle of causality to the appearances). Hegel's distinction between the unknowable and the circumstantially unknown can be seen as the beginnings of Hegel's rational system of the universe.

Yet another philosopher of the late Enlightenment that was influential in the 19th century was [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827), whose formulation of [[nomological determinism]] is famous up to this day.

== Philosophical schools and tendencies ==
This is a partial list of schools of 19th-century philosophy (also known as [[late modern philosophy]]).

===German idealism===
{{main|German idealism}}
{{also|Post-Hegelianism|Neo-Kantianism}}
One of the first philosophers to attempt to grapple with Kant's philosophy was [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], whose development of Kantian metaphysics became a source of inspiration for the [[Romanticism|Romantics]]. In ''[[Wissenschaftslehre (Fichte)|Wissenschaftslehre]]'', Fichte argues that the self posits itself and is a self-producing and changing process.

[[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], a student of Fichte, continued to develop many of the same ideas and was also assimilated by the Romantics as something of an official philosopher for their movement. But it was another of Fichte's students, and former roommate of Schelling, who would rise to become the most prominent of the post-Kantian idealists: [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. His work revealed the increasing importance of historical thinking in German thought.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], rejecting Hegel and also materialism, called for a return to Kantian transcendentalism, at the same time adopting [[atheism]] and [[determinism]], amongst others. His secular thought became more popular in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, which coincided with the advents of [[Darwinism]], [[positivism]], [[Marxism]] and [[David Strauss|philological analysis of the Bible]]. 

In the second half of the 19th century, an even more orthodox return to Kantian thought was espoused by a number of [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantian]] philosophers based in two main locations: the Marburg School and the Baden School. This trend of thought survived into the beginning of the next century, influencing 20th century philosophical movements such as Neopositivism and Phenomenology.

One of the most famous opponents of idealism in the first half of the German 19th century was [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], who advocated [[materialism]] and [[atheism]].

===Utilitarianism===
{{main|Utilitarianism}}
In early 19th century [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] promoted the idea that actions are right as they maximize happiness, and happiness alone.

===Marxism===
{{main|Marxism}}
Developed by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in the mid-to-late-19th Century, Marxism is a sociopolitical and economic view based on the philosophy of [[dialectical materialism]], which opposes [[idealism]] in favour of the [[materialism|materialist]] viewpoint. Marx analysed [[Marx's theory of history|history]] itself as the progression of [[dialectic]]s in the form of [[class struggle]]. From this it is argued that "the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles." According to Marx, this began with the phase of [[primitive communism]] ([[hunter-gatherer]] society), after which the [[Neolithic Revolution]] gave way to [[slavery|slave societies]], progressing into the [[feudal society]], and then into his present era of the [[Industrial Revolution]], after which he held that the next step was for the [[proletariat]] to overthrow the owners of industry and establish a [[socialist]] society, which would further develop into a [[communist]] society, in which class distinctions, money, and the state would have withered from existence entirely.

Marxism had a profound influence on the history of the 20th Century.

===Existentialism===
{{main|Existentialism|Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche}}
[[Existentialism]] as a philosophical movement is properly a [[20th-century philosophy|20th-century]] movement, but its major antecedents, [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote long before the rise of existentialism. In the 1840s, academic philosophy in Europe, following Hegel, was almost completely divorced from the concerns of individual human life, in favour of pursuing abstract metaphysical systems. Kierkegaard sought to reintroduce to philosophy, in the spirit of [[Socrates]]: subjectivity, commitment, faith, and passion, all of which are a part of the [[human condition]].

Like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche saw the moral values of 19th-century Europe disintegrating into [[nihilism]] (Kierkegaard called it the ''levelling'' process). Nietzsche attempted to undermine traditional moral values by exposing its foundations. To that end, he distinguished between [[master-slave morality|master and slave moralities]], and claimed that man must turn from the meekness and humility of Europe's slave-morality.

Both philosophers are precursors to existentialism, among other ideas, for their importance on the "great man" against the age. Kierkegaard wrote of 19th-century Europe, "Each age has its own characteristic depravity. Ours is perhaps not pleasure or indulgence or sensuality, but rather a dissolute pantheistic contempt for the individual man."

===Positivism===
{{main|Positivism}}
[[Auguste Comte]], the self-professed founder of modern [[sociology]], put forward the view that the rigorous ordering of confirmable observations alone ought to constitute the realm of human knowledge. He had hoped to order the sciences in increasing degrees of complexity from mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and a new discipline called "sociology", which is the study of the "dynamics and statics of society".&lt;ref&gt;Comte, Auguste. ''Course on Positive Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pragmatism===
{{main|Pragmatism}}
The [[American philosophy|American philosophers]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]] developed the pragmatist philosophy in the late 19th century.

===British idealism===
The twilight years of the 19th century in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] saw the rise of [[British idealism]], a revival of interest in the works of Kant and Hegel.

===Transcendentalism===
{{main|Transcendentalism}}
Transcendentalism was rooted in [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] and [[German idealism]], led by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. The main belief was in an ideal spiritual state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical and is only realized through the individual's intuition, rather than through the doctrines of established religions.

===Social Darwinism===
{{main|Social Darwinism}}
"Social Darwinism" refers to theories that apply the [[evolutionary]] concept of [[natural selection]] to [[human society]].

"'''Aegukga'''" ({{Lang-ko|애국가/愛國歌}}, {{Literal translation|"Love Country Song"}}), often translated as "'''The Patriotic Song'''", is the [[national anthem]] of [[South Korea]]. It was adopted in 1948, the year the country was founded. Its music was composed in the 1930s and its lyrics date back to the 1890s. The lyrics of "Aegukga" were originally set to the music of the Scottish song "[[Auld Lang Syne]]" before [[Ahn Eak-tai]] composed a unique melody specifically for it in 1935. Before the founding of South Korea, the song's lyrics, set to the music of "Auld Lang Syne", was sung, as well as during [[Korea under Japanese rule]] by dissidents. The version set to the melody composed by Ahn Eak-tai was adopted as the national anthem of the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea|Korean exile government]], which existed during Korea's occupation by Japan from the early 1910s to the mid-1940s. 

"Aegukga" has four verses, but on most occasions only the first one is sung when performed publicly at events such as baseball games and soccer matches.

==Etymology==
The ''[[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]'' defines "Aegukga" as "the song to wake up the mind to love the country". "Aegukga" in itself is differentiated from a national anthem. While a national anthem or ''gukga'' is an official symbol of the state, ''aegukga'' refers to any song, official or unofficial, that contains patriotic fervor towards its country, such as [[Hungary]]'s "[[Szózat]]" or the U.S. "The Stars and Stripes Forever". However, the nationally designated "Aegukga" plays the role of symbolizing the country.&lt;ref name="Encykorea Aegukga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0035201|title=애국가|publisher=[[Academy of Korean Studies]]|accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doopedia Aegukga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&amp;MAS_IDX=101013000851180|title=애국가[愛國歌]|publisher=Doosan Coroporation|accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general shorthand, the term ''aegukga'' refers to the [[national anthem]] of [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="Naver Definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krdic.naver.com/detail.nhn?docid=25456600|title=애국-가愛國歌|publisher=NAVER Corp.|accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there are still more than ten other extant "Aegukgas" in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="Encykorea Aegukga" /&gt;

[[File:Aegukga, 1942.oga|thumb|"Aegukga" sung in the early 1940s]]
[[File:National anthem of South Korea performed in October 2011 at the White House.oga|thumb|The South Korean national anthem performed by a U.S. military band in 2011, during an official South Korean state visit to the U.S.]]
===Origins===
In the 1890s, the previously established [[Joseon]] dynasty began to contact other countries for the first time, including the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. The meeting with foreign countries gave rise to patriotism, which then created several "Aegugkas". For instance, works in 1896 includes "Aeguka" created by [[Na Pil-gun]], [[Han Myung-one]], and [[Lee Yong-mu]].&lt;ref name="Encykorea Aegukga" /&gt; On November 21, 1896, scholars from the [[Pai Chai University|Pai Chai school]] sang a version of "Aegukga" in the independence door ceremony. However, this song differs from the song sung by the [[Military Academy]] in 1898 and from the songs sung on the birthday of the former emperor.&lt;ref name="Encykorea Aegukga" /&gt;

However, a book from the [[Korean Empire]] in 1900 has a record of a national anthem. It was called the "[[Korean Empire Aegukga]]", or literally the "Anthem of the Greater Korean Empire". The anthem is commonly believed to be written by [[Franz Eckert]].&lt;ref name="Encykorea Aegukga" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Han Music"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1950562&amp;cid=659&amp;categoryId=1345|title=대한제국애국가|publisher=NAVER Corp.|accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people contend that records documenting Franz Eckert's actions show that it was physically impossible for him to write the anthem. It is guessed that the song sung by the Paejae school was the Scottish song "[[Auld Lang Syne]]" and that the song sung by the Military Academy is a version of the British song "[[God Save the Queen]]".&lt;ref name="Encykorea Aegukga" /&gt;

The song attributed to Eckert was established by the military in 1902. A version of Eckert's song with different lyrics began to be officially implemented in the schools in 1904. All the schools were forced to sing the version of the song. The policy is thought of as a by-product of the [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905]] and the [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1907]].&lt;ref name="Encykorea Aegukga" /&gt;

There are many theories concerning the writer of the currently official lyrics of "Aegukga". It is most commonly believed that the lyrics were written for the cornerstone-laying ceremony of the [[Independence Gate]] in Seoul in 1896 by [[Yun Chi-ho]], a Korean politician.&lt;ref name="Encykorea Aegukga" /&gt;&lt;ref name="National Anthem Korea"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nationalanthems.me/south-korea-aegukga/ | title=South Korea – Aegukga | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=2011-11-17 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424213957/http://www.nationalanthems.me/south-korea-aegukga/ | archive-date=2012-04-24 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Kim Gu]] during the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea|Korean government-in-exile]] era, said to his comrades: "In the [[March 1st Movement]], we had the [[Taegeukgi]] and the Aegukga. Why should who wrote it be an issue?" He wrote: "The lyrics and the anthem's spirit are more important than the nature of the lyricist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo-press.optian.co.kr/td_d_slug_26/|title=대학토론 배틀 – 좋은 투자의 조건 -|first=|last=팽귄기자|website=demo-press.optian.co.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories name the lyricist as [[An Chang-ho]], [[Choi Byung-hun]], [[Kim In-sik]], [[Min Yeong-hwan]], or some combination of the aforementioned writers. The "Committee to search for the composer of 'Aegukga'" was established in 1955 by the government on the request of the United States, but the committee concluded that there was not enough evidence to name a lyricist.&lt;ref name="Doubt Aegukga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1846035&amp;cid=476&amp;categoryId=476|title=안익태가 애국가를 처음 만들었다?|publisher=NAVER Corp.|accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, "Aegukga" was sung to the tune of the Scottish folk song "[[Auld Lang Syne]]", introduced to Korea by [[Western Hemisphere|western]] [[Missionary|missionaries]]. The [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea|Provisional Korean Government]] (1919&amp;ndash;1945) in [[Shanghai]], [[Republic of China (1912&amp;ndash;49)|China]] adopted it as their national anthem. At a ceremony celebrating the founding of South Korea on 15 August 1948, the Scottish tune was finally replaced by the Finale of "[[The Symphonic Fantasy Korea|Korea Fantasia]]", which [[Ahn Eak-tai]] had composed in 1935. The new "Aegukga" was later adopted by the [[Presidential Decree]] of 1948 by the then South Korean President [[Syngman Rhee]] (or Lee Seungman).

===Copyright===
Since the composer [[Ahn Eak-tai]] died in 1965, the [[copyright]] for the music was to not expire until at least 2036. Two South Korean professional football clubs were sued by a copyright holders' group for playing this song in December 2003.&lt;ref name="Aegukga Sue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/section-005000000/2003/12/005000000200312121918302.html|title=애국가 틀때도 저작권료 내야돼?|publisher=The Hankyoreh|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on March 16, 2005, the composer's widow—Lolita Ahn—and her family relinquished all rights to "Aegukga" to the South Korean government.&lt;ref name="Aegukga Current"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news1.kr/articles/1325060|title=애국가 작곡가 안익태 48주기 추모식|publisher=News1 Korea|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Aegukga" has since become a [[public domain]] song.&lt;ref name="Aegukga Archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/RepublicOfKorea-NationalAnthem|title=Republic of Korea - National Anthem|publisher=Internet Archive|accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Criticism===
The South Korean national anthem's lyrics have been criticized by some as being too focused on racial nationalism instead of civic republicanism,&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"/&gt; thus festering patriotism towards a "Korean race" rather than the South Korean state itself,&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"/&gt; possibly endangering South Korea's national security in the face of a North Korean military threat by festering sympathy for the North Korean regime.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/North+Korea's+state-loyalty+advantage.-a0274114570|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180520092751/https://www.thefreelibrary.com/North+Korea's+state-loyalty+advantage.-a0274114570|deadurl=yes|last=Myers|first=Brian Reynolds|authorlink=Brian Reynolds Myers|title=North Korea's state-loyalty advantage.|quote=The national anthem conveys no republican ideals at all, referring only to the ancient race and homeland.|work=Free Online Library|date=22 September 2011|archivedate=20 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alberta Culture and Tourism''' is a ministry of the [[Executive Council of Alberta|Executive Council]] of [[Alberta]]. It was created on September 15, 2014, and is responsible for Alberta's cultural industries, tourism, the arts, heritage and nonprofit/voluntary sector as well as sport and recreation.

== Administrative history ==
The culture, tourism, and recreation functions of Alberta's government have on several occasions in past been overseen by separate ministers. They have also been, more than once, sections within the portfolio of the same minister. They have also each been joined to still other government departments at various points.

A separate tourism ministry goes back at least to 1968 when [[Allen R. Patrick]] was named Minister of Industry and Tourism.  From 1971 to 1975, tourism as an issue was assigned to a minister without a portfolio, and there was no separate tourism department.  In 1979 Tourism and Small Business became a separate ministry, renamed simply "Tourism" in 1985.  In the major restructuring of 1992, Tourism was reunited with Economic Development; Parks and Recreation was added as well.  This situation was mostly static for the next two decades.  The ministry was known as '''Alberta Tourism, Parks, and Recreation''' (TPR) from 2006 to 2014.

Culture and recreation were (along with youth issues) together under the purview of the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Recreation from 1971 to 1975, after which recreation moved to '''Alberta Recreation, Parks and Wildlife''', which was its own ministry from 1975 to 1992, before being merged into Tourism during the major restructuring of that year.

The Cultural Affairs Department was founded in 1975 by Order in Council 518/1975, under the authority of the ''Public Service Administrative Transfers Act''.  The minister responsible for this was known as the Minister Responsible for Culture (1975–1980), Minister of Culture (1980–1987), and Minister of Culture and Multiculturalism (1987–1992).&lt;ref name="admin history"&gt;http://culture.alberta.ca/paa/archives/research/adminhistory.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Agencies which reported to the minister included the [[Alberta Cultural Heritage Foundation]] (1978–1987), [[Alberta Multiculturalism Commission]] (1987–1992), [[Alberta Art Foundation]] (1972–1991), [[Alberta Foundation for the Performing Arts]] (1978–1991), [[Alberta Foundation for the Literary Arts]] (1984–1991), [[Alberta Foundation for the Arts]] (1991–1992), [[Alberta Library Board]] (1948–1992), and [[Alberta Advisory Council on the Status of Women]] (1986–1987).  During this time the minister was responsible for implementing the following legislation: [[Alberta Academy Act]], [[Alberta Art Foundation Act]], [[Alberta Emblems Act]], [[Alberta Foundation for the Arts Act]], [[Alberta Heritage Day Act]], [[Alberta Historical Resources Act]], [[Alberta Order of Excellence Act]], [[Alberta Women's Bureau Act]], [[Amusements Act (Alberta)|''Amusements Act'' (Part 3)]], [[Cultural Development Act]], [[Cultural Foundations Act]], [[Department of Culture Act]], [[Department of Culture and Multiculturalism Act]], [[Foreign Cultural Property Immunity Act]], [[Glenbow-Alberta Institute Act]], [[Government House Act]], [[Libraries Act]], and [[Registered Music Teachers' Association Act]].&lt;ref name="admin history"/&gt;

During the 1992 restructuring the former Department of Culture and Multiculturalism and former Department of Tourism, Parks, and Recreation were dissolved and replaced by the Ministry of Community Development.  This contained all of the current components of the ministry (along with parks).  From 2006 to 2008 this ministry was renamed '''Alberta Tourism, Parks, Recreation and Culture'''.  On March 12, 2008 culture was broken out in a new ministry called '''Alberta Culture and Community Spirit''' (it was renamed simply '''Alberta Culture''' on May 8, 2012).

In 2014, Culture was reunited with Tourism (including recreation), but this time without Alberta Parks, which moved to the Ministry of Environment and Parks.

==Ministry structure==
{{asof|2015}} the ministry includes Travel Alberta, the [[tourism]] [[marketing agency]] of the ministry,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tpr.alberta.ca/about/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; the Alberta Sport, Recreation, Parks and Wildlife Foundation, also known as Alberta Sport Connection, as a [[non-profit]] [[Crown corporations of Canada|Crown corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.albertasport.ca/about-us/.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Alberta Foundation for the Arts]], [[Alberta Historical Resources Foundation]], and [[Government House Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culture.alberta.ca/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tourism regions of Travel Alberta ==
Travel Alberta divided the province into five tourism regions:&lt;ref&gt;http://travelalberta.com/Places%20to%20Go/Regions.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
*Canadian Badlands

==Plot==
Following the events of [[Alien vs. Predator (film)|the previous film]], a [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] ship leaves Earth carrying [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]] facehuggers, and the body of Scar, the Predator that defeated the Alien Queen. A chestburster with traits of both species erupts from Scar's body. It quickly matures into an adult [[Predalien]] and starts killing the Predators on board (in the extended cut, this happens on a scout ship that has been detached from the mother ship). A Predator's weapon punctures the hull and the ship crashes in the forest outside of [[Gunnison, Colorado]], killing all but one of the Predators, who's severely injured.

The Predalien and several facehuggers escape, implanting embryos into a nearby father and son who are out hunting in the forest, as well as several homeless people that live in the sewers. The injured Predator sends a distress signal before being killed by the Predalien. On the Predator homeworld, a skilled veteran Predator, Wolf, receives the signal and takes it upon himself to travel to Earth to hunt and kill the Aliens. He arrives at the crashed Predator ship, uses a blue acid-like liquid to dissolve and erase evidence of the Aliens' presence, and triggers an explosion to further destroy the vessel.

Meanwhile, ex-convict Dallas Howard has just returned to Gunnison after serving time in prison. He is greeted by Sheriff Eddie Morales and reunites with his younger brother Ricky. Ricky has a romantic interest in his classmate Jesse, but is constantly harassed by her boyfriend Dale and his two friends. Kelly O'Brien has also just returned to Gunnison after serving in the military, and reunites with her husband Tim and daughter Molly. Darcy Benson, the wife of the murdered father, begins her search for her missing husband and son. Meanwhile, local waitress Carrie Adams discovers she is pregnant, but her police officer husband, Ray, is killed by Wolf after witnessing him dissolving the bodies of Darcy's husband and son while he was searching for them in the forest.

Wolf tracks several [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Aliens]] in the sewer and defeats many of them, and as the battle reaches the surface, several of them disperse into the town. Wolf pursues some to the power plant, where [[collateral damage]] from his plasma caster weapon causes a citywide [[power outage]]. Ricky and Jesse meet at the high school swimming pool, but are interrupted by Dale and his cohorts just as the power goes out and an Alien enters the pool, killing Dale's friends. Another Alien invades the O'Brien home, killing Tim while Kelly escapes with Molly. After the fry cook at the local diner where Carrie works is attacked by the Aliens, Carrie is also attacked after hearing the cook's screams and is impregnated by the Predalien with bellybusters. Darcy discovers her body in horror but Sheriff Morales arrives and brings her with him.

Kelly, Molly, Ricky, Jesse, Dale, Dallas, and Sheriff Morales gather at a sporting goods store to collect weapons. Troops from the [[Colorado Army National Guard]] arrive, but are quickly killed by the Aliens. Wolf briefly captures Dallas inside the store to use as bait to lure the Aliens, but Dallas escapes. Several Aliens arrive and Wolf handily defeats them. Dale is killed by an Alien during the battle and one of Wolf's shoulder plasma casters is damaged. He removes his remaining one and modifies it into a hand-held blaster.

As the survivors attempt to escape Gunnison, they make radio contact with Colonel Stevens and are told that an air evacuation is being staged at the center of town. Dallas and Kelly are skeptical, as going to the center of town would cause them to become surrounded by the Aliens, and they along with Ricky, Jesse, Molly and a few others, go for the helicopter at the hospital to get out of town while Sheriff Morales and Darcy head to the evacuation zone. However, the hospital has been invaded and overrun by the Aliens and the Predalien, who has impregnated some pregnant women to breed more Aliens. Wolf soon arrives at the hospital where he dispatches more Aliens and during the battle, the Predator accidentally impales Jesse with one of his [[Shuriken]] weapons; distraught, Ricky rushes Wolf with his rifle fire only to be injured by the Predalien. The Predator is attacked by an Alien, and both tumble down an elevator shaft. Dallas takes possession of Wolf's plasma blaster.

Dallas, Ricky, Kelly and Molly reach the roof and fight off several Aliens before escaping in the helicopter, while Wolf, having survived the fall, battles the Predalien on the roof in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. Wolf and the Predalien mortally wound each other just as a [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|military jet]] arrives. Rather than a rescue airlift, it executes a [[Tactical nuclear weapon|tactical nuclear]] strike that levels the entire city, instantly killing Sheriff Morales, Darcy, and everyone else gathered at ground zero. The shock wave causes the fleeing helicopter to crash in a clearing, where the survivors are rescued by the military. Wolf's plasma blaster is confiscated, and Colonel Stevens presents it to Ms. Yutani. Yutani tells him that the world is not yet ready for this kind of advanced technology.

==Production==
Inspired by ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', brothers Colin and Greg Strause moved to Los Angeles to break into the film business. After an unsuccessful attempt to find employment at [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]], the brothers worked on [[The X-Files (film)|''The X-Files'' film]] in 1998 and founded their own special effects company, [[Hydraulx]]. The company produced special effects for films such as ''[[Volcano (1997 film)|Volcano]]'', ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Poseidon (2006 film)|Poseidon]]'' and ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' and the brothers began a career directing commercials and music videos. Colin believes Hydraulx secured a strong relationship with [[20th Century Fox]], which owns the ''Alien'' and ''Predator'' franchises.&lt;ref name="AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back"&gt;{{cite web|title=AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back Page 1|author=Mclean, Thomas|publisher=''Vfxworld''|date=December 21, 2007|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&amp;format=rss&amp;id=3501|accessdate=February 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brothers unsuccessfully pitched an idea for the first ''Alien vs. Predator'' film and Fox almost bought a film titled ''Wolfenstein'' suggested by the brothers, "When the script came up for this movie, they thought we'd be perfect for it because it's an ambitious movie for the budget that they had and they knew that having our visual effects background was going to be a huge thing."&lt;ref name="AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back"/&gt; The brothers were hired to direct the sequel to ''Alien vs. Predator'' in late spring 2006 and had limited time to start filming in the fall.&lt;ref name="AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back"/&gt; The film's original title was ''Alien vs. Predator: Survival of the Fittest'', but was later dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/91651-alien-vs-predator-2-update|title=Alien vs. Predator 2 Update|publisher=SuperheroHype|date=July 31, 2006|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colin estimates Hydraulx produced 460 of the 500 visual effects shots including the nuclear explosion which was created using [[Maya (software)|Maya]] fluids and BA Volume Shader. The interior of the Predator ship was created using CGI, as the brothers felt it would be more cost effective than building a set.&lt;ref name="AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back 2"/&gt; The visual effects team peaked at 110 people for several months and averaged 70, almost all of the entire Hydraulx staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back Page 3|author=Mclean, Thomas|publisher=''Vfxworld''|date=December 21, 2007|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&amp;id=3501&amp;page=3|accessdate=February 21, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080306040032/http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&amp;id=3501&amp;page=3| archivedate= 6 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using their knowledge in visual effects and making use of principal photography, the brothers tried to film as much as they could on camera without resorting to CGI, Colin said "other than the exterior spaceship shots, there are no pure CG shots." CGI was used for the Alien tails and inner jaws, whereas they required puppeteers and wire removal on previous films. The main visual effects of the film included set design, a nuclear explosion, the Predator's ship crashing and the Predator cloak, about which Colin stated "We wanted to make sure it didn't look too digital." &lt;ref name="AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back 2"/&gt;

As a side-note, in the DVD commentary the brothers explained that they want actor [[Adam Baldwin]] to reprise his role as Garber in ''[[Predator 2]]'', but unable to do so, instead using Robert Joy as a new character. Additionally, while the previous installment attracted casual moviegoers as well as fans of the franchises, the film catered exclusively to ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' fans with many references to the previous films appearing in the film.

===Music===
{{Main|Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (soundtrack)}}
Composer [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]], was hired to the score for the film. The film's main theme track is a clash of two main themes, one consisting of the Predator type theme (bongos and basses) and the second of the Aliens (high pitched violins, violas and flutes). The directors Colin and Greg Strause wanted to take a new direction from [[Harald Kloser]]'s ''Alien vs. Predator'' score and wanted Tyler to use some reference to the three films' original score pieces, such as the horrific violas and percussion from [[James Horner]]'s ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' and the primitive tribal percussion from [[Alan Silvestri]]'s ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' and ''Predator 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmzene.net/read.php?u=interju_brian_tyler_english_2.html|title=Rambo vs. Predator|date=January 30, 2008|accessdate=August 23, 2009|work=Filmzene.net|author=Hubai, Gergely}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyler also referenced composer [[John Frizzell (composer)|John Frizzel]]'s ''[[Alien: Resurrection]]'' into the score, in the tracks of "Down to Earth" and "Taking Sides".

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 11% based on reviews from 70 critics. The website's consensus states: "The increased gore and violence over the first ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' can't excuse ''Requiem''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s disorienting editing, excessively murky lighting, and lack of new ideas."&lt;ref name="tomatoes"&gt;{{cite web | title = Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (AVP 2) | url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avp2/ | publisher = [[Fandango Media]] | website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 29 out of 100, based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref name="metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|website=[[Metacritic]]|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/avprequiem |access-date=February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade of "C" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title=CinemaScore|work= [[CinemaScore]] |access-date= November 6, 2018 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Hewitt of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' called it an "early but strong contender for worst movie of 2008".&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20170610044713/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/aliens-vs-predator-requiem/review/ &lt;/ref&gt; Stina Chyn of ''[[Film Threat]]'' felt the camerawork "is a smidge too shaky and the lighting/color design too dark for me to relish the Predator-on-Alien butt-kicking".&lt;ref&gt;http://filmthreat.com/uncategorized/alien-vs-predator-requiem/ &lt;/ref&gt; Josh Rosenblatt of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' dismissed the film stating it was "An orgy of mindless violence, a random collection of bloody bodies, alien misanthropy and slobbering carnage designed to bore straight into the pleasure centers of 13-year-old boys and leave the rest of us wondering when the movies got so damn loud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/2007-12-28/573326/ |title=Josh Rosenblatt — Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem|publisher=''[[The Austin Chronicle]]''|access-date= November 6, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk Honeycutt of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' contributor called it a "dull actioner that looks like a bad video game".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/aliens-predator-requiem-159329 &lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Nashawaty of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt it was a "B movie that truly earns its B," and gave it a grading of "B" on an A to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;https://ew.com/article/2008/01/09/aliens-vs-predator-requiem/ &lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' contributor Joe Leydon said it "Provides enough cheap thrills and modest suspense to shake a few shekels from genre fans before really blasting off as homevid product".&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2007/film/reviews/aliens-vs-predator-requiem-1200553818/ &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/aliens-vs-predator-requiem-1200553818/ &lt;/ref&gt;  Ryan Stewart of ''Cinematical'' said he "can't recommend it as a good movie on its own merits, stocked as it is with cardboard cutout characters and a barely coherent plot, but it's miles more interesting than the last ''Alien vs. Predator'' film."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20071229081846/http://www.cinematical.com/2007/12/28/review-aliens-vs-predator-requiem/ &lt;/ref&gt; 

There was the occasional positive review; Neil Genzlinger of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated "It may not be classic sci-fi like the original ''Alien'', which it has in its DNA, but it's a perfectly respectable next step in the series."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/26/movies/26alie.html &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Accolades===
''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' was nominated for two Golden Raspberry awards in the fields of Worst Excuse for a Horror Movie and Worst Prequel or Sequel. The awards went to ''[[I Know Who Killed Me]]'' and ''[[Daddy Day Camp]]'', respectively.

'''Anti-clerical art''' is a genre of art portraying clergy, especially [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] clergy, in unflattering contexts.  It was especially popular in France during the second half of the 19th century, at a time that the anti-clerical message suited the prevailing political mood.  Typical paintings show [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] in their bright red robes engaging in unseemly activities within their lavish private quarters.

Nineteenth and early twentieth century artists known for their anti-clerical art include [[Francesco Brunery]], [[Georges Croegaert]], [[Charles Édouard Delort]], [[Jehan Georges Vibert]], [[Jules Benoit-Levy]] and [[Eduardo Zamacois y Zabala]].  [[Masami Teraoka]] is among the contemporary painters producing anti-clerical art.

The hoard was unearthed in the nineteenth century at the Hill of St Louis in Carthage, which at the time of its deposition was the largest city of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsulare]].&lt;ref name=bowl/&gt;  Most of the treasure was purchased by Sir [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]], a senior curator at the British Museum, who bequeathed it to the museum upon his death in 1897. However, a small part of the treasure can be found in the [[Louvre]], including one of the silver covered bowls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=9434 Louvre Collection], Louvre Collection, retrieved April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and attribution==
[[Image:Carthage (2).JPG|thumb|A bowl with low relief scenes of shepherds]]
Dating to the second half of the fourth century AD, the Carthage Treasure comprises 31 different objects, primarily luxury silver tableware and jewellery that must have belonged to a wealthy Roman family who for some reason decided to [[hoard|bury it for safe-keeping]]. This may have been because of the religious feud around the year 400 but it is more likely that the treasure was hidden from the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals, led by [[Gaiseric]], invaded Africa Proconsulare from Spain in 429 and in 439 the city [[Battle of Carthage (439)|became]] capital of the [[Vandal Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=caygill&gt;{{cite book|last=Caygill|first=Marjorie|title=The British Museum A&amp;ndash;Z Companion|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1135968942|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1135968942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inscribed in the centre of one of the dishes around the [[tondo (art)|tondo]] is D D ICRESCONI CLARENT, which is associated with the Cresconii, a powerful Roman North African family in Carthage&lt;ref name=bowl&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/b/bowl_from_the_carthage_treasur.aspx Bowl from the Carthage Treasure], Highlights, British Museum, retrieved 3 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; who are well known from deeds and records of office-holders at this time.

==Description of the treasure==

The treasure includes a pair of flat dishes (one of which identifies the family), two bowls with chased and hammered pastoral scenes in relief around the edge,&lt;ref name=bowl /&gt; four hemispherical [[bowl]]s with high tapering feet (two of which still have their covers), a shallow bowl with handle and [[frog]] engraved in the centre, twelve silver spoons, and a mixed collection of [[jewellery]]: a finger ring, a cameo, a pair of ear rings, several [[Engraved gem|intaglios]] and two necklaces, one made of gold, the other with precious stones.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; The jewelled necklace consists of twelve polygonal emeralds, thirteen sapphires, matched by twenty five pearls all joined by gold links.&lt;ref name=arc&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofearly00britiala/catalogueofearly00britiala_djvu.txt ''Catalogue of early Christian antiquities and objects from the Christian East in the Department of British and mediaeval antiquities and ethnography of the British museum''], [[Ormonde Maddock Dalton|O. M. Dalton]], 1901&lt;/ref&gt;

The family would have owned two collections of silver: One known as ''argentum potorium'' that was the drinking set and another for eating called the ''argentum escarium''. Amongst this find were several silver hemispherical lidded bowls that measure 12&amp;nbsp;cm high and 12&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. The vessels' elegant design includes a tall base that complements the knop of the bowl's lid. The bowls also incorporate subtle [[facet]]s on the lids' curved surfaces.&lt;ref name=coveredbowl /&gt; Similar bowls have been found at the Roman site of [[Viminacium]] near the modern town of [[Kostolac]] in Serbia.&lt;ref name=coveredbowl&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/silver-bowl-from-the-carthage-treasure/dwGIZejwDjWdNQ Silver bowl from the Carthage Treasure], British Museum, retrieved 10 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Click''''' is a 2010 Hindi [[horror film]] directed by [[Sangeeth Sivan]].  The film is a remake of 2004 [[Thai cinema|Thai]] horror film [[Shutter (2004 film)|Shutter]].&lt;ref name=clicky/&gt;

==Plot==
Avi is an ace photographer who is in a live-in relationship with Sonia, a model. One night while returning from a party, the couple accidentally knocks down a young girl with their speeding car. As Sonia was driving the car, to avoid further complications, Avi insists on them fleeing from the accident scene. But trouble starts for the couple soon after. While strange white marks begin to appear in Avi's photos, Sonia starts having spooky experiences. Avi also develops a severe neck pain and even though he does not appear to be overweight, a scale reveals that he weighs 120 kilograms. Avi, too, starts having experiences similar to Sonia's.
The couple is petrified when all of Avi's best friends commit suicide in a similar manner. It then comes to light that the spirit haunting them all has a connection to Avi's college life. Meanwhile, Sonia finds out that Avi was friends with a girl named Aarti during his college days. As Avi and Sonia are still being haunted by Aarti they go and visit her, but realize that Aarti is dead, having apparently committed suicide by using a knife. Aarti's mother believes that she is still alive, thinking that she is merely ill and will recover.
On the way home Aarti continues to haunt Avi and Sonia, and again during the night at the hotel she also haunts him as Avi is sleeping, ending up with him being thrown off the fire escape.

Later Avi is in the hospital and Sonia tells him that Aarti will be cremated, and they visit her funeral before returning to their home town. Sonia finds some photos of Aarti, where she is crawling to get something. As she follows the pattern indicated by Aarti, Sonia discovers that Avi's best friends (who later committed suicide) are raping Aarti.
When Sonia talks to Avi about this dark secret, he tells her that he only wanted Aarti to understand his feelings, but that when his best friends tried to talk to her, Aarti hurt Avi's friend Tarun, who became angry and with his friends raped her. Avi claims that when he entered the room he was shocked at the scene and tried to help her, but that Tarun then said that Avi had asked them to rape her as a way of avoiding jail, and accused Avi of planning to do this to her and having one of Avi's friends taking the pictures.
Avi then tells Sonia that the reason he kept the photos was to remind him that he failed to protect Aarti and say he is the guilty one. But Sonia leaves him and wishes him that Aarti may forgive him. Later on Avi attempts to kill himself in the same way his best friends did, but as a Polaroid camera clicks towards him, he sees Aarti sitting on his shoulders. Avi is suddenly thrown through the window, and ends up in hospital, where it is revealed that the reason why she was sitting on his shoulders was that Aarti had still loved Avi.
As Sonia makes another photograph of Avi, she speaks to Aarti, asserting that one day she will let go as the reflection in the mirror shows Aarti still leaning on Avi's back.

A '''collegium''' is a [[France|French]] form of schooling that is both a [[secondary school]] and a [[college]].

==Information==
They are uncommon today. Most collegiums in the United States were built by [[Roman Catholic]] [[religious institute]]s. One example is the [[College of the Immaculate Conception (New Orleans)|College of the Immaculate Conception]] in [[New Orleans]], established by the [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits) in 1847.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In most instances, the effect is a rather negative one as it has disrupted many Africans’ traditional norms and practices. For instance, many West African communities rely on [[Traditional African medicine|traditional healers]] and [[witch doctors]], who use herbal remedies, massage, chant, and witchcraft to cure just about any ailment.&lt;ref name="afro.who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/4216-ebola-virus-disease-west-africa-3-july-2014.html|title=Ebola virus disease, West Africa – update 3 July 2014|publisher=WHO|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wesleymc.com/util/documents/TraditionsThatMayImpactEbolaTransmission.pdf |title=West African Cultural Norms/Traditions That May Impact Ebola Transmission |publisher=HCA |accessdate=9 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109123732/http://wesleymc.com/util/documents/TraditionsThatMayImpactEbolaTransmission.pdf |archivedate=January 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, it is difficult for West Africans to adapt to foreign medical practices. Specifically, West African resistance to Western medicine is prominent in the region, which calls for severe distrust of Western and modern medical personnel and practices.{{small|(see [[Cultural effects of the Ebola crisis#Ebola conspiracies|Ebola conspiracies]] below.)}}&lt;ref name=Gassel&gt;{{cite web |url= http://publichealth.tufts.edu/About-Us/Public-Health-Rounds-Newsletter/How-Cultural-Norms-and-Practices-Impact-Ebola-OutbreakPage |title=How Cultural Norms and Practices Impact Ebola Outbreak |author= Sammi Gassel&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Tufts University |publisher=Tufts University |access-date=July 2, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, some African cultures have a traditional [[solidarity]] of standing by the sick, which is contrary to the safe care of an Ebola patient.&lt;ref name="afro.who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; This tradition is known as "standing by the ill" in order to show one's respect and honor to the patient. According to the Wesley Medical Center, these sorts of traditional norms can be dangerous to those not infected with the virus as it increases their chances of coming in contract with their family member's bodily fluids.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; In [[Liberia]], Ebola has wiped out entire families, leaving perhaps one survivor to recount stories of how they simply could not be hands off while their loved ones were sick in bed, because of their culture of touch, hold, hug and kiss.&lt;ref name="nyt20141005"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/world/africa/ebolas-cultural-casualty-hugs-in-hands-on-liberia.html|title=Ebola’s Cultural Casualty: Hugs in Hands-On Liberia|publisher=The New York Times|first=Helene|last=Cooper|date=4 October 2014|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some communities traditionally use [[folklore]] and mythical literature, which is often passed on verbally from one generation to the next to explain the interrelationships of all things that exist. However the folklore and songs are not only of traditional or ancient historical origins, but are often about current events that have affected the community. Additionally, folklore and music will often take opposing sides of any story. Thus early in the Ebola epidemic, the song "White Ebola" was released by a [[diaspora]] based group and centers on the general distrust of "outsiders" who may be intentionally infecting people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu/students/curriculum/m11/background.php|title=A brief background and history of African literatures|publisher=Exploring Africa|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="culanth592"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culanth.org/fieldsights/592-beats-rhymes-and-ebola|title=Beats, Rhymes and Ebola|publisher=Boima Tucker|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This initial misinformation increased the general distrust in foreigners, and the idea that Ebola was not in Africa before their arrival led to attacks on many health workers as well as blockages of aid convoys blocked from checking remote areas. A burial team, which was sent in to collect the bodies of suspected Ebola victims from [[West Point, Monrovia|West Point]] in Liberia, was blocked by several hundred residents chanting: "No Ebola in West Point." Health ministries and workers started an aggressive Ebola information campaign on all media formats to properly inform the residents and allow aid workers safe access to the high risk areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/health-workers-battle-trust-issues-attacks-in-ebola-outbreak/|title=Health workers battle trust issues, attacks in Ebola outbreak|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-armed-men-attack-liberia-ebola-clinic-freeing-patients/|title=Report: Armed men attack Liberia Ebola clinic, freeing patients|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Guinea]], riots broke out after medics disinfected a market in [[Nzerekore]]. Locals rumored that the medics were actually spreading the disease. In nearby [[Massacre at Womey|Womey]], 8 people distributing information about Ebola were killed by the villagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29256443|title=Ebola outbreak: Guinea health team killed|publisher=BBC News|date=19 September 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== West African cultural traditions and norms==
[[File:Response volunteers in Nigeria.jpg|thumb|right|Volunteers distribute health information in Nigeria.]]
The Ebola epidemic of 2014 has forced West Africans to face numerous difficulties on daily basis regarding their traditional norms and practices. In essence, their traditions have been severely disrupted due to the [[Ebola virus]]. For instance, Africans have had the tendency to remain close to their sick family members to nurse them during illness for centuries. Unfortunately for the African community, many have been encouraged to keep their distance from their infected family members as potential contact could be fatal. In addition, it is part of their culture to touch the deceased at funerals and for the sister of the deceased’s father to bathe, clean, and dress the corpse in a favorite outfit. When there is not an aunt to perform this task, a female elder in their community is then held responsible. Not only is it customary to wash and touch the deceased, but also to kiss those that have passed.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Specifically, funerals are considered to be major cultural events for families and friends to gather around to celebrate the deceased. The funeral performances, which involve wailing and dancing, is done out of care and respect for the dead. Funerals in Africa often last for several days, depending on the status of the person who died. In other words, the more important the person who died was while they were alive, the longer the mourning will last. More importantly, there is a common bowl used for ritual hand-washing towards the end of the ceremony, including a final kiss or touch on the face, which is to be bestowed on the dead. This is commonly referred to as a "love touch."  The [[Wesley Medical Center]] has confirmed that prohibiting African families from performing such rites is a disgrace as it insults the deceased, putting the remaining family in danger. Specifically, it is believed that the dead person’s spirit, also known as "tibo," will cause harm and bring illness to the family as a result of an improper burial.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt;

===Resistance to Western medicine===
Resistance to Western medicine is considered to be a significant barrier to battling the Ebola virus.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt; The Wesley Medical Center claims that the interference with African burial rituals caused by Western medical practices has prohibited them from properly honoring their loved ones.  They believe that this may have been a reason for heightened distrust in medical professionals, and that the mistrust enhances each time family members of infected persons are prohibited from participating in the funeral or seeing the dead body in person.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; Due to the mistrust Ebola-stricken communities in Liberia reportedly hid family members with Ebola from health care providers and held secret burials.&lt;ref name=Ravi&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sociocultural Dimensions of the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in Liberia|url = http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/bsp.2014.1002|journal = Biosecurity and Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, Practice, and Science|date = 2014-10-23|issn = 1538-7135|pages = 301–305|volume = 12|issue = 6|doi = 10.1089/bsp.2014.1002|first = Sanjana J.|last = Ravi|first2 = Eric M.|last2 = Gauldin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sierra Leone health workers made more progress because health measures were implemented according to WHO guidance, which advises health workers to heed the traditions of the threatened communities when attending to the dead. Therefore, funerals were held in agreement with the wishes of the families, but also gave health workers an opportunity to disinfect the bodies.&lt;ref name=Ravi/&gt; In many of the Ebola infected areas in Africa, Western medicine is also believed either to be ineffective or to be the actual origin of the virus. In other words, there is a belief among the African community that Western doctors are intentionally killing their patients with their treatments. A conspiracy theory also says that the medical professionals are planning to harvest the organs of those dying from Ebola.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt;

Resistance to Western medicine exists also because of the look of the hazmat suits, which are worn by healthcare workers to protect themselves from becoming infected with the Ebola virus.  The protective equipment is said to frighten many West Africans and also believed to be hostile and intimidating to the African families.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt; Lastly, the interference in the family’s care for the patient diminishes the honor of the patient as well as hindering the family’s duty to provide comfort and care.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; Regardless of the existing resistance towards Western medicine, handling the bodies of the deceased poses a high risk of contagion as Ebola is contracted through physical contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids. This is mainly because preparation for burial includes touching, washing, and kissing as is mentioned above. Those that are preparing for the funeral can become easily infected as they can easily become exposed to the infected person’s blood, vomit, diarrhea, and other bodily fluids as these are the main symptoms of the virus.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt;

===Traditional medical practices===
Apart from the fact that traditional African healers have been using ritual and herbal remedies for many centuries, the African people also trust these treatments and find the costs more affordable. Traditional procedures include the following:  magic, biomedical methods, fasting, dieting, herbal therapies, bathing, massage, as well as surgery. Surgical procedures often involve cutting a patient’s skin with unsterilized knives.   Sometimes, traditional healers apply blood to the skin to rid them of their sickness.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; Despite the severe distrust of Africans in modern medicine, the Ebola virus has been said to spread rampantly across West Africa due to a shortage of healthcare workers and limited medical resources and facilities. The unsanitary conditions in the overall African region have also made it easier for Ebola to spread.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt;

== Personal account of a West African student==

Alakey Osei, a student and bank-teller from [[Freetown, Sierra Leone]], described the Sierra Leonean capital as a ghost-town, as a result of the increasing death toll in the [[West Africa]]n region caused by the [[Ebola epidemic]].  Osei states that "everyone is scared to be out of their houses. No one is going to church or mosque, no one is going to work, the kids are not going to school, [and] people are not even going to the market place".  The fact that the city of Freetown has been completely abandoned is foreign to the student, because the nation is and has always been heavily reliant on physical contact and very close interaction. Osei has indicated that following the no touching rule that the medical personnel have been promoting is extremely difficult for her. Osei continues by saying that she does not even know how her people are surviving.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In her interview, Osei provides some insight about her childhood. She moved to US in 2008 when she was thirteen years old. She experienced extensive bullying for her obliviousness to [[American culture]] and simply for being the "uncivilized" African.  For example, others had asked her if she was getting accustomed to wearing shoes since people do not wear shoes in Africa. She was also called names, such as monkey and pre-historic. As a result of this cruelty, she began to believe that American culture was very cold. She also noticed that Americans were "protective of their property", space, and time. She concluded that American society is "extremely individualistic". This truly made her miss living in Africa, "... where every woman is your mother and every man is your father, ... where you are never alone, because everyone is family and family is all around you".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

As of October 2014, the Ebola virus had not reached her home-town back in Sierra Leone; however, she said that her family still living in the country claimed that Freetown did not "feel like the same place" anymore. Her aunt had told her that people were not sharing food anymore nor spending time at each other's houses as they used to because of the fear of becoming infected. Osei finds it heart-breaking that people in Sierra Leone have turned to isolation as a way to stay Ebola-free. Osei now says that "Freetown has become Fear-town", and that "Ebola has turned us into prisoners in our own country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hilltopviewsonline.com/viewpoints/article_ccf50fda-4f0a-11e4-858f-001a4bcf6878.html |title=Student from Sierra Leone tells of cultural impact of Ebola |author=Rosemond Crown&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 8, 2014 |website=Hilltop Views |publisher=Hilltop Views |access-date=July 2, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bushmeat==
The Ebola virus, for which the primary host is suspected to be [[Megabat|fruit bats]], has been linked to [[bushmeat]], which is commonly consumed in areas of West Africa that use it as a protein source. Although primates and other species may be intermediates, evidence suggests people primarily get the virus from bats. Hunters usually shoot, net, scavenge or catapult their prey, and butcher the bats without gloves, getting bites or scratches and coming in contact with their blood.&lt;ref name=camghana&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/understanding-the-bushmeat-market-why-do-people-risk-infection-from-bat-meat|title=Understanding the bushmeat market: why do people risk infection from bat meat?|work=Research News|publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_18Oct2014"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Hogenboom | first1 = Melissa | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/health-29604204 | publisher = BBC News | title = Ebola: Is bushmeat behind the outbreak? | date = October 18, 2014 | accessdate = October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the suspected [[index case]] for the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|Ebola outbreak in West Africa]] is a two-year-old child in [[Guéckédou Prefecture|Guéckédou]] in south-eastern Guinea, who was the child of a family that hunted two species of fruit bat,&lt;ref name="BBC_18Oct2014"/&gt; ''[[Hammer-headed bat|Hypsignathus monstrosus]]'' and ''[[Franquet's epauletted fruit bat|Epomops franqueti]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/voice-field/struggling-contain-ebola-epidemic-west-africa | publisher = MSF USA | title = Struggling to Contain the Ebola Epidemic in West Africa | date = July 8, 2014 | accessdate = October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers suggested the case was caused by [[Zoonosis|zoonotic transmission]] though the child playing with an [[Microbat|insectivorous bat]] from a colony of [[Angolan free-tailed bat]]s near the village.&lt;ref name=EMBOMM123014&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Almudena Marí Saéz |author2=Sabrina Weiss |author3=Kathrin Nowak |author4=Vincent Lapeyre |author5=Fee Zimmermann |author6=Ariane Düx |author7=Hjalmar S Kühl |author8=Moussa Kaba |author9=Sebastien Regnaut |author10=Kevin Merkel |author11=Andreas Sachse |author12=Ulla Thiesen |author13=Lili Villányi |author14=Christophe Boesch |author15=Piotr W Dabrowski |author16=Aleksandar Radonić |author17=Andreas Nitsche |author18=Siv Aina J Leendertz |author19=Stefan Petterson |author20=Stephan Becker |author21=Verena Krähling |author22=Emmanuel Couacy‐Hymann |author23=Chantal Akoua‐Koffi |author24=Natalie Weber |author25=Lars Schaade |author26=Jakob Fahr |author27=Matthias Borchert |author28=Jan F Gogarten |author29=Sébastien Calvignac‐Spencer |author30=Fabian H Leendertz |title=Investigating the zoonotic origin of the West African Ebola epidemic|journal=EMBO Molecular Medicine|date=December 30, 2014|issue=Published online|doi=10.15252/emmm.201404792|url=http://embomolmed.embopress.org/content/early/2014/12/29/emmm.201404792|accessdate=December 31, 2014|publisher=EMBO Press|format=online|quote=The severe Ebola virus disease epidemic occurring in West Africa likely stems from a single zoonotic transmission event involving a 2‐year‐old boy in Meliandou, Guinea, who might have been infected by hunting or playing with insectivorous free‐tailed bats living in a nearby hollow tree|volume=7|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/ebola-6-months/guinea/en/|title=Ground zero in Guinea: the outbreak smoulders – undetected – for more than 3 months|work=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite health organisations warning about risks of bushmeat, surveys pre-dating the 2014 outbreak indicate that people who eat bushmeat are usually unaware of the risks and view it as healthy food. Because of bushmeat's role as a protein source in Western Africa, it is traditionally associated with good nutrition, and efforts to outlaw the sale and consumption of bushmeat have been impossible to enforce and have met with suspicion from rural communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/239123/icode/|title=FAO warns of fruit bat risk in West African Ebola epidemic|work=FAO|date=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that between 30 and 80 percent of protein intake in rural households in Central Africa comes from wild meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/news_151010.html|title=Bushmeat consumption, wildlife trade and global public health risks|work=FAO|date=15 Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ebola conspiracies ==
* The ''[[Liberian Observer]]'', a major Liberian newspaper, has repeatedly published Ebola-related conspiracy theories. In September 2014 it published an article claiming that Ebola and the [[HIV|AIDS virus]] are [[GMO|genetically modified organisms]] to be used as [[Biological warfare|bio-weapons]] on Africans in an attempt to reduce Africa’s population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberianobserver.com/security/ebola-aids-manufactured-western-pharmaceuticals-us-dod|title=Ebola, AIDS Manufactured by Western Pharmaceuticals, US DoD?|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/17/the-major-liberian-newspaper-churning-out-ebola-conspiracy-after-conspiracy/  "The major Liberian newspaper churning out Ebola conspiracy after conspiracy", [[The Washington Post]], Terrence McCoy, October 17, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; In October the story went viral on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2014/10/28/Is-the-US-manufacturing-the-Ebola-virus-with-HIV|title=Claims of US manufacturing Ebola with HIV go viral|author=Jean-Jacques Cornish|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa developed in 2014, a number of popular self-published and well-reviewed books containing sensational and misleading information about the disease appeared in electronic and printed formats. The authors of some such books admitted that they lacked medical credentials and were not technically qualified to give medical advice. The World Health Organization and the United Nations stated that such misinformation had contributed to the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dewey|first=Caitlin|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/10/02/popular-on-amazon-wildly-misleading-self-published-books-about-ebola-by-random-people-without-medical-degrees/|title=Popular on Amazon: Wildly misleading self-published books about Ebola, by random people without medical degrees|date=2 October 2014|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Liberia, some body-collection teams dispatched to collect the Ebola dead have collected bribes to issue falsified death certificates to family members, stating that their dead relative did not die from Ebola. The body of the Ebola victim would also be left with relatives. Ebola carries a stigma in Liberia, and some families do not want to admit that their relative died of Ebola. Another factor is that families wish to give their relative a traditional burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-ebola-stricken-african-families-pay-bribes-for-fake-death-records-1413153854|title=Some Ebola-Stricken African Families Pay Bribes for Fake Death Records|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|first=Heidi|last=Vogt|date=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In late October 2014 it was reported that harassment of gay Liberians in Monrovia was occurring after some church leaders said that "God was angry with Liberians over corruption and immoral acts such as homosexuality, and that Ebola was a punishment". The harassment included car windows being smashed and some gay people were forced from their homes and had to go into hiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/23/us-foundation-ebola-liberia-gay-idUSKCN0IC1GV20141023?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=healthNews|title= "Gay community under attack in Liberia over Ebola outbreak", Reuters, Misha Hussain and Maria Caspani, October 23, 2014.|work=Reuters|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of Ebola-themed jokes circulating in West Africa to spread awareness.&lt;ref name="Bloom20140827"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-27/tell-me-the-one-about-ebola-how-jokes-spread-awareness.html|title=Tell Me the One About Ebola: How Jokes Spread Awareness|publisher=Bloomberg|author1=Pauline Bax|author2=Makiko Kitamura|date=27 August 2014|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 the Liberian Football Association made an announcement that all soccer related activities would be put on hold "''indefinitely to protect players and fans''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28542577|title=Ebola outbreak: Liberia suspends football|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=29 July 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, in a joint venture between [[FIFA]] and [[WHO]], the [[Antoinette Tubman Stadium]] was converted into an Ebola treatment center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-12/monrovia-soccer-stadium-to-house-ebola-centre-fifa/5738710|title=Ebola outbreak: Soccer stadium in Liberia to be converted to virus treatment centre, FIFA says|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=12 September 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 [[African Cup of Nations]] (AFCON) was temporarily put on hold when the original hosts, [[Morocco]], asked the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF) to postpone the final games till 2016, due to the Ebola outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30004279|title=Africa Cup of Nations: Morocco will not host finals over Ebola fears|publisher=BBC|date=11 November 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAF eventually moved the finals to [[Equatorial Guinea]], which eliminated Morocco from the game as hosts, and brought Equatorial Guinea in, even though they had been eliminated prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30053859|title=2015 Nations Cup: Equatorial Guinea to host tournament|publisher=BBC|date=14 November 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the qualifiers for 2015 AFCON have been influenced by many countries' fear of Ebola, with many refusing to enter or allow entry of teams from affected countries. In July 2014, [[Seychelles]] refused entry to the Sierra Leone team. CAF ruled that Seychelles forfeited the game, giving Sierra Leone an automatic pass to the next stage. [[Lesotho]] refused to send the [[African Youth Championship|Under-20]] team to [[Nigeria]]. CAF again ruled that Lesotho forfeited the game, sending Nigeria through to the finals.&lt;ref name="f24201408"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20140824-african-football-struggles-play-amid-ebola-outbreak-cup-of-nations/|title=African football in disarray amid Ebola outbreak|publisher=FRANCE 24|date=24 August 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, CAF also decided to forbid any official games in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. For Liberia, who had already been eliminated, this was not of concern.&lt;ref name="f24201408" /&gt; Sierra Leone managed to move some home games to the visiting teams home; both home and away games against [[DR Congo]] were played in [[Lubumbashi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28995543|title=Sierra Leone move Afcon tie with DR Congo to Lubumbashi|publisher=BBC|author=Mohamed Fajah Barrie|date=30 August 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both games against [[Cameroon]] were played in [[Yaounde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29330276|title=Nations Cup 2015: Cameroon and Sierra Leone find venues|publisher=BBC|author=Mohamed Fajah Barrie|date=24 September 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guinea managed to get their home games moved to [[Casablanca]], Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28844477|title=Guinea move Togo 2015 Nations Cup qualifier to Morocco|publisher=BBC|date=18 August 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after calls to have the 2015 AFCON postponed, the Equatorial Guinea government and CAF organisers have downplayed these concerns, and insisted that they would have ample measures in place, including: {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
*Temperature check for all passengers arriving at the international airports.

On 7 August 2014 a social media hoax message was doing the rounds in [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa#Nigeria|Nigeria]]. It urged readers to "''bath with hot water and salt before daybreak''" and to drink as much of it as possible. On 8 August the person who started the joke message to see how many of their friends would fall for it, identified it as such and posted an apology.&lt;ref name="dt17323"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailytrust.com.ng/weekly/index.php/notes-from-atlanta/17323-understanding-how-the-salt-and-water-ebola-cure-hoax-spread-in-nigeria|title=Understanding how the salt-and-water Ebola cure hoax spread in Nigeria|publisher=Media Trust Limited|first=Farooq|last=Kperogi|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoax-slayer.com/salt-water-ebola-remedy-hoax.shtml|title=Salt Water Ebola Prevention Hoax Leads to Deaths|publisher=hoax slayer|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoax message quickly went viral when "''several gullible, unsophisticated opinion leaders''" repeated the hoax message.&lt;ref name="dt17323" /&gt; Within days many were hospitalized due to excessive salt intake, with 2 deaths in [[Jos]], [[Plateau State|Plateau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.view.com.ng/ebola-virus-two-die-after-drinking-salt-water-in-jos/|title=Ebola Virus, Two die after drinking salt water in Jos|publisher=View|author=Clems|date=9 August 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 deaths in [[Benué State|Makurdi, Benue]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailypost.ng/2014/08/14/ebola-two-nigerians-die-drinking-bathing-hot-salt-water/|title=Ebola: Two more Nigerians die drinking, bathing with hot salt water|publisher=Daily Post|first=Adenike|last=Orenuga|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least 3 deaths in [[Bauchi State|Bauchi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/08/four-feared-dead-intake-salt-water-bauchi/|title=Four feared dead after intake of salt water in Bauchi|publisher=Vanguard|first=Suzan|last=Edeh|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is ironic that these deaths all happened in states that had no known EVD infected people. In fact only [[Lagos State]] and [[Rivers State]] had any infected. Furthermore, the unconfirmed death toll of the hoax cure is as many as the EVD death toll for Nigeria, with 8 deaths each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/135600/1/roadmapsitrep_1Oct2014_eng.pdf?ua=1|title=WHO: Ebola Response Roadmap Situation Report|publisher=WHO|date=1 October 2014|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/weekly/index.php/features/17359-ebola-more-deaths-from-salt-therapy-than-virus|title=Ebola: More deaths from "salt therapy" than virus|publisher=Media Trust Limited|first=Onimisi|last=Alao|author2=Hassan Ibrahim|author3=Ahmed Mohammed|author4=Hope Abah|author5=Femi Akinola|author6=Lagos|author7=Judd-Leonard Okafor|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two separate incidents in October, flights have been delayed from disembarking because of an Ebola joke. On 8 October 2014, [[US Airways]] flight 845 from [[Philadelphia]] to [[Punta Cana]], [[Dominican Republic]] was held up for two hours on the tarmac when an American passenger sneezed, then announced "I have Ebola. You're all screwed," during the flight. After landing, he was escorted off the plane by four emergency personnel wearing blue [[hazmat suit]]s, and detained until medical tests cleared him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/10/10/355108686/ebola-joke-triggers-passengers-removal-from-us-airways-flight|title=Ebola Joke Triggers Passenger's Removal From US Airways Flight|publisher=NPR|first=Scott|last=Neuman|date=10 October 2014|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2787292/Hazmat-team-rushed-meet-US-plane-Dominican-Republic-passenger-sneezed-yelled-I-Ebola-poor-taste-joke.html|title=What NOT to say on a plane: American passenger bundled off U.S. to Dominican Republic flight by hazmat team after sneezing and joking 'I have Ebola!'|publisher=Daily Mail|author=Mia De Graaf|date=9 October 2014|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 October 2014, during the [[Aer Lingus]] flight EI 433, from [[Milan]], [[Italy]] to [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] a passenger wrote "'Attenzione Ebola'" ("Attention Ebola") on a coffee lid before handing it to his daughter. The container and lid were discreetly disposed of, however a flight attendant noticed, and alerted the captain. The passenger was arrested, and later pleaded guilty to "engaging in threatening, abusive or insulting behavior on an airplane contrary to the [[Air Navigation and Transport Act]]", and was fined 2500 [[euro]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29845065|title=Man fined over Ebola joke on Dublin to Milan Aer Lingus flight|publisher=BBC|date=31 October 2014|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/passenger-to-pay-2-500-over-sick-ebola-joke-on-dublin-plane-1.1983405?page=1|title=Passenger to pay €2,500 over ‘sick’ Ebola joke on Dublin plane|first=Tom|last=Tuite|publisher=THE IRISH TIMES|date=31 October 2014|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Duke Nukem 3D''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[3D Realms]]. It is a sequel to the [[platform game]]s ''[[Duke Nukem (video game)|Duke Nukem]]'' and ''[[Duke Nukem II]]'', published by 3D Realms.

''Duke Nukem 3D'' features the adventures of the titular [[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke Nukem]], voiced by [[Jon St. John]], who fights against an [[alien invasion]] on Earth. Along with ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' and ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''Duke Nukem 3D'' is considered to be responsible for popularizing first-person shooters, and was released to major acclaim. Reviewers praised the interactivity of the environments, gameplay, level design, and unique risqué humor, a mix of pop-culture satire and lampooning of over-the-top Hollywood action heroes. The game's violent nature, [[eroticism|erotic elements]], and [[Gender representation in video games|portrayal of women]] incited controversy.

The shareware version of the game was originally released on January 29, 1996, while the full version was released on April 19, 1996 as version 1.3d. The ''Plutonium PAK'', an expansion pack which updated the game to version 1.4 and added a fourth eleven-level episode, was released in November 1996. The ''Atomic Edition'', a standalone version of the game that included the content from the ''Plutonium PAK'' and updated the game to version 1.5, was later released; the original version of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' has since been discontinued. An official fifth episode was released on October 11, 2016 with ''20th Anniversary World Tour'' published by [[Gearbox Software]]. After [[Development of Duke Nukem Forever|fifteen years]] in [[development hell]], a direct sequel was released in 2011 called ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]''.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Duke3d 000.png|thumb|left|''Duke Nukem 3D'' gameplay at the beginning of the first level ("Hollywood Holocaust")]]
As a [[first-person shooter]] whose gameplay is similar to ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', the gameplay of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' involves moving through levels presented from the protagonist's point of view, shooting enemies on the way. The environments in ''Duke Nukem 3D'' are highly destructible and interactive; most props can be destroyed by the player.&lt;ref name="history1"&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Duke Nukem: Duke Enters The Third Dimension |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/duke_hist/p3_01.html |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828043821/http://uk.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/duke_hist/p3_01.html |archivedate=August 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespotr"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Soete |title=Duke Nukem 3D Review for PC |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/dukenukem3d/review.html |date=May 1, 1996 |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 1, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703011455/http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/dukenukem3d/review.html |archivedate=July 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levels were designed in a fairly non-linear manner such that players can advantageously use [[air duct]]s, back doors, and sewers to avoid enemies or find hidden caches. These locations are also filled with objects with which the player can interact, that either benefit the player in some form, light switches make it easier to see, while [[water fountain]]s and broken [[hydrant]]s provide some health points or simply diversion, and tipping [[strippers]] provokes a quote from Duke, and a provocative reveal from the dancer.

Duke's arsenal consists of the "Mighty Foot" (a basic kick attack), a [[pistol]], a [[shotgun]], a triple-barrelled [[chain gun]], a [[Rocket-propelled grenade|rocket-propelled grenade launcher]], [[pipe bomb]]s, freeze and [[shrink ray]]s, laser [[land mines]], and the rapid fire "Devastator" rocket launcher. There is also an extra weapon known as the "Expander", the opposite of the shrink ray weapon, which is only available in the ''Atomic Edition'' version of the game.

Various items can be picked up during gameplay. The portable [[First-aid kit|medkit]] allows players to heal Duke at will. [[Steroid]]s speed up Duke's movement, as well as instantly reversing the effects of the shrink ray weapon and increasing the strength of Duke's Mighty Foot for a short period. [[Night vision]] goggles allow players to see enemies in the dark. The "HoloDuke" device projects a [[hologram]] of Duke which can be used to distract enemies. Protective boots allow Duke to cross dangerously hot or toxic terrain. In sections where progress requires more aquatic legwork, an [[aqua-lung]] allows Duke to take longer trips underwater. Duke's [[jet pack]] allows the player to move vertically and gain access to otherwise inaccessible areas.

The game features a wide variety of enemies; some of which are [[extraterrestrial life in culture|aliens]] and other [[mutant (fictional)|mutated]] humans. The [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] have been turned into "Pig Cops", a [[play on words|play]] on the derogatory term "pig" for police officers, with '''LARD''' emblazoned on their uniforms. As is usual for a first-person shooter, Duke Nukem encounters a large number of lesser foes, as well as [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]], usually at the end of episodes. Like Duke, these enemies have access to a wide range of weapons and equipment, and some weaker enemies have jet packs.

=== Multiplayer ===
''Duke Nukem 3D'' features multiplayer. At the time of its release, Internet-based gaming was just beginning. ''Duke Nukem 3D'' did not support the [[TCP/IP]] client/server model, instead based its network play on the [[IPX]] [[LAN]], modem or serial cable. ''Duke Nukem 3D'' players often either battled modem-to-modem, using the IPX network utility [[Kali (software)|Kali]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kali.net/games.asp |title=Kali compatible games |accessdate=March 25, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219104641/http://www.kali.net/games.asp |archivedate=February 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Total Entertainment Network]] (TEN) online pay service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ten.net/199706/html/ten__duke_nukem.html |title=Duke Nukem 3D on Ten.net |accessdate=March 25, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801143819/http://www.ten.net/199706/html/ten__duke_nukem.html |archivedate=August 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kali allowed users to connect to a chat room to host and join games. ''Duke Nukem 3D'' was one of the more popular games on TEN prior to the closure of the network in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the Total Entertainment Network |url=http://www.bestinclass.com/about/ten |website=BestInClass.com |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |date=2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106095359/http://www.bestinclass.com/about/ten |archivedate=January 6, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was also supported by [[DWANGO]].&lt;ref name=UGO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/history-of-online-gaming-1993-1994 |title=History of Online Gaming - 1993-1994: DOOM and DWANGO |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=January 16, 2013 |publisher=UGO |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014095704/http://www.ugo.com/games/history-of-online-gaming-1993-1994 |archivedate=October 14, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Duke Nukem 3D''{{'s}} levels were often used as the battlegrounds for these encounters, and users were even able to create their own [[level (video gaming)|levels]], or maps, using the [[Build engine|level editor]] bundled with the game, which was also used by the developers to design the initial levels.&lt;ref name="dukemaps"&gt;{{cite web|title=Duke Maps Site: Free user-generated Duke Nukem 3D Maps created with the Build engine |url=http://dukemaps.tvgio.com |publisher=user-generated content freely distributed |accessdate=July 10, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118114739/http://dukemaps.tvgio.com/ |archivedate=January 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also features co-operative play, co-op, which allows players to complete the story based single player mode together. In ''Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition'', a new game play mode was introduced: Duke-Tag, a "[[capture the flag]]" style mode.

''Duke Nukem 3D'' has been ported to run on modern Microsoft Windows variants including Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8. This has been made possible since the game's [[source code]] was publicly released in 2003. Various [[source port]]s have been made including ''EDuke32'', ''JFDuke3D'', ''nDuke'', ''hDuke'', and ''xDuke''. All five offer the original visual appearance of the game, while ''EDuke32'' also supports [[OpenGL]] rendering including the capability to use fan-created modern graphics using the High Resolution Pack.&lt;ref name="hrp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Duke Nukem 3D: High Resolution Pack |url=http://hrp.duke4.net/ |date=September 15, 2012 |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820140245/http://hrp.duke4.net/ |archivedate=August 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''nDuke'', ''hDuke'' and ''xDuke'' can still be played online in multiplayer 'DukeMatch' format using launchers such as Duke Matcher and YANG, both freely available. ''EDuke32''{{'s}} multiplayer is in a state of [[development hell]] following an attempt to rewrite the network functionality using a [[client–server model]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Plot ==

=== Setting ===
''Duke Nukem 3D'' is set on Earth "sometime in the early 21st century".&lt;ref name="3drealms"&gt;{{cite web|title=3D Realms Site: Duke Nukem 3D Atomic Edition |url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/duke3d/index.html |publisher=[[3D Realms]] |accessdate=July 1, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110121558/http://legacy.3drealms.com/duke3d/index.html |archivedate=November 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The levels of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' take players outdoors and indoors through rendered street scenes, military bases, [[desert]]s, a flooded city, [[space station]]s, moon bases, and a [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] restaurant.

The game contains several humorous references to pop culture. Some of Duke's lines are drawn from movies such as ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', ''[[Evil Dead II]]'', ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'',&lt;ref name="stuff gaming greats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.tv/news/past-and-future/gaming-greats/gaming-greats-%E2%80%93-duke-nukem-3d-1996 |title=Gaming Greats – Duke Nukem 3D (1996) |publisher=[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]] |work=stuff.tv |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=January 30, 2012 |quote="I'm gonna rip off your head and excrete down your neck" [...] "It's time to kick ass and chew bubble gum... and I’m all outta gum."

Players will encounter corpses of famous characters such as [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Indiana Jones]], [[Snake Plissken]], [[Doomguy|the protagonist]] of ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', and a smashed [[Terminator (character)|T-800]]. In the first episode, players navigate a tunnel in the wall of a prison cell hidden behind a poster, just like in ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]''. During the second episode, players can see [[Monolith (Space Odyssey)|The Monolith]] (from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'') on the moon. In the bathroom of the first level, [[867-5309]] is written on a wall.

The game cover itself is a parody of ''[[Army of Darkness]]'', with Duke posing as [[Ash Williams]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

=== Story ===
There is little narrative in the game, only a brief text prelude located under "Help" in the Main Menu, and a few [[cutscene]]s after the completion of an episode. The game picks up right after the events of ''[[Duke Nukem II]]'', with Duke returning to Earth in his space cruiser. As Duke descends on [[Los Angeles]] in hopes of taking a vacation, his ship is shot down by unknown hostiles. While sending a distress signal, Duke learns that aliens are attacking Los Angeles and have mutated the [[LAPD]]. With his vacation plans now ruined, Duke hits the "eject" button, and vows to do whatever it takes to stop the alien invasion.

In "Episode One: ''L.A. Meltdown''", Duke fights his way through a [[dystopia]]n Los Angeles. At a [[strip club]], he is captured by pig-cops, but escapes the alien-controlled penitentiary and tracks down the alien cruiser responsible for the invasion in the [[San Andreas Fault]]. Duke discovers that the aliens were capturing women, and detonates the ship. Levels in this episode include a movie theater, a Red Light District, a prison, and a nuclear-waste disposal facility.

In "Episode Two: ''Lunar Apocalypse''", Duke journeys to [[outer space|space]], where he finds many of the captured women held in various [[incubator (neonatal)|incubator]]s throughout space stations that had been conquered by the aliens. Duke reaches the alien mothership on the Moon and kills an alien Overlord. As Duke inspects the ship's computer, it is revealed that the plot to capture women was merely a ruse to distract him. The aliens have already begun their attack on Earth.

In "Episode Three: ''Shrapnel City''", Duke battles the massive alien resistance through Los Angeles once again, and kills the leader of alien menace: the Cycloid Emperor. The game ends as Duke promises that after some "[[R&amp;R (military)|R&amp;R]]", he will be "...ready for more action!", as an anonymous woman calls him back to bed. Levels in this episode include a sushi bar, a movie set, a subway, and a hotel.

The story continues in the ''Atomic Edition''. In "Episode Four: ''The Birth''", it is revealed that the aliens used a captured woman to give birth to the Alien Queen, a creature which can quickly spawn deadly alien protector drones. Duke is dispatched back to Los Angeles to fight hordes of aliens, including the protector drones. Eventually, Duke finds the lair of the Alien Queen, and kills her, thus thwarting the alien plot. Levels in this episode include a fast-food restaurant ("Duke Burger"), a supermarket, a Disneyland parody called "Babe Land," a police station, the [[Exxon Valdez]], and [[Area 51]].

With the release of ''20th Anniversary World Tour'', the story progress further. In "Episode Five: ''Alien World Order''", Duke finds out that the aliens initiated a world-scale invasion, so he sets out to repel their attack on various countries. Duke proceeds to clear out aliens from Amsterdam (Netherlands), Moscow (Russia), London (England), San Francisco (USA), Paris (France), Giza Pyramid (Egypt), Rome (Italy), with the final showdown with the returning alien threat taking place in Los Angeles, taking the game full circle. There, he defeats the Cycloid Incinerator, the current alien leader, stopping their threat for good.

== Development ==
''Duke Nukem 3D'' was developed on a budget of roughly $300,000.&lt;ref name="Barton99"&gt;Barton, Matt (April 22, 2011). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_i3-aoHnww Matt Chat 99: Duke Nukem with Scott Miller] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406161230/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_i3-aoHnww |date=April 6, 2017 }}, YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; The development team consisted of eight people for most of the development cycle, increasing to 12 or 13 people near the end.&lt;ref name="Barton99"/&gt; At one point the game was being programmed to allow the player to switch between first person view, third person view, and fixed camera angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=3D Realms|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=October 1995|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott Miller (entrepreneur)|Scott Miller]] of 3D Realms recalled that "with ''Duke 3D'', unlike every shooter that came before, we wanted to have sort of real life locations like a cinema theatre, you know, strip club, bookstores..."&lt;ref name="Barton99"/&gt;

''LameDuke'' is a [[beta version]] of ''Duke Nukem 3D'', which was released by 3D Realms as a "bonus" one year after the release of the official version. It has been released as is, with no support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3D Realms Site: Master Download Page |url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/downloads.html |publisher=3D Realms |accessdate=December 13, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110122114/http://legacy.3drealms.com/downloads.html |archivedate=November 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''LameDuke'' features four episodes: ''Mr. Caliber'', ''Mission Cockroach'', ''Suck Hole'', and ''Hard Landing''. Certain weapons were altered from the original versions and/or removed.

[[Lee Jackson (composer)|Lee Jackson]]'s theme song "Grabbag" has elicited many spin-offs and remixes over the years by both fans and professional musicians, including an officially sanctioned studio version by the popular [[thrash metal]] outfit [[Megadeth]]. Another version of the song was recorded by [[Chris Kline]] in August 2005. [[3D Realms]] featured it on the front page of their website and contracted with Kline to use it to promote their [[Xbox Live]] release of ''Duke Nukem 3D''.&lt;ref name="YT_vertexguy_dukeXBL"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NExBO-QOdIU |title=Official Duke Nukem 3D Xbox LIVE Arcade Trailer |accessdate=August 4, 2009 |publisher=[[3D Realms]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929212745/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NExBO-QOdIU |archivedate=September 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It introduced two new enemies, the Protector Drone and the Pig Cop Tank, a new final boss, the Alien Queen, and a new weapon, the Expander. Changes to the script made the game easier to [[mod (video gaming)|mod]], and players could set up a multiplayer session against CPU [[artificial intelligence (video games)|bots]].

Online multiplayer was added to the game in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/82854/duke-nukem-3d-megaton-edition-gets-free-multiplayer-update |title=Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition gets free multiplayer update |last=Mejia |first=Ozzie |date=January 28, 2014 |publisher=[[GameFly]] |work=[[Shacknews]] |accessdate=January 28, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203194147/http://www.shacknews.com/article/82854/duke-nukem-3d-megaton-edition-gets-free-multiplayer-update |archivedate=February 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, about a year later, the Megaton Edition was removed from all digital distribution as Devolver Digital's agreement with Gearbox Software has ended now that the latter company currently owns the [[intellectual property]].

* '''''Duke Nukem 3D''''' ([[Game.com]]) was released in 1997 in the USA only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamefaqs.com/gamecom/564274-duke-nukem-3d/data Game.com release data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121094726/http://www.gamefaqs.com/gamecom/564274-duke-nukem-3d/data |date=January 21, 2011 }}, GameFAQs.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike every other version of the game, Duke Nukem cannot turn; he can only move forward, backward, and strafe to the left or right. Due to the Game.com's monochrome screen, it is also the only version to lack color. It only includes four levels from each of the original three episodes for a total of 12 levels. These levels were modified to accommodate Duke Nukem's inability to turn.
* '''''Duke Nukem 3D''''' ([[Sega Saturn]]) was ported by [[Lobotomy Software]] and published by [[Sega]] in 1997. It retains the original name and uses Lobotomy Software's own fully 3D ''SlaveDriver'' engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Rich|last=Leadbetter |title=Lobotomy Interviewed!

[[File:Duke Nukem 64.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nintendo 64]] port. Note its level design changes and that some sprites were replaced with polygonal models.]]
* '''''Duke Nukem 64''''' is a port released in 1997 for the [[Nintendo 64]] which features a [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] 4-player mode. In-game music was removed due to [[Nintendo 64 Game Pak|limited storage capacity]], many items were renamed to avoid drug and sex references, and new lines of dialogue were recorded specifically for this version to remove profanity. Several levels were altered to include areas from the ''Atomic Edition'', such as a Duke Burger outlet in the second level which was not in the original PC version. Levels are played sequentially instead of as separate episodes. Other changes include the addition of four new weapons, dual sub-machine guns, a grenade launcher, a missile launcher, and the Plasma Cannon, alternative ammo types for the pistol, shotgun, and missile launcher, and a fully 3D model for the Cycloid Emperor boss. The Protector Drone, an enemy from the ''Atomic Edition'', also appears a few times in the standard levels.

== Source ports ==
{{Anchor|Source code}}
Following the release of the ''Doom'' [[source code]] in 1997, gamers wanted a similar source code release from 3D Realms. The last major game to make use of the ''Duke Nukem 3D'' source code was TNT Team's ''[[World War II GI]]'' in 1999. Its programmer, Matthew Saettler, obtained permission from 3D Realms to expand the gameplay enhancements done on ''WWII GI'' to ''Duke Nukem 3D''.

''EDuke'' was a semi-official branch of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' that was released as a patch as ''Duke Nukem 3D'' v2.0 for ''Atomic Edition'' users on July 28, 2000. It included a demo mod made by several beta testers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saettler.com/eduke/ |title=Enhanced Duke Nukem 3D |publisher=Saettler.com |date= |accessdate=August 15, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530064204/http://www.saettler.com/eduke/ |archivedate=May 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2000/07/eduke_patch_rel.html |title=3D Realms News: EDuke Patch Released! |publisher=3drealms.com |date=July 28, 2000 |accessdate=December 21, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110122310/http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2000/07/eduke_patch_rel.html |archivedate=November 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It focused primarily on enhancing the CON scripting language in ways which allowed those modifying the game to do much more with the system than originally possible. Though a further version was planned, it never made it out of beta. It was eventually cancelled due to programmer time constraints. About a month after the release of the ''Duke Nukem 3D'' source code, ''[[Blood (video game)|Blood]]'' project manager Matt Saettler released the source code for both ''EDuke'' v2.0 and EDuke v2.1, the test version of which would have eventually become the next ''EDuke'' release, under the GPL.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The [[source code]] to the ''Duke Nukem 3D'' v1.5 executable, which uses the Build engine, was released as [[free software]] under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] on April 1, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siegler |first=Joe |title=3D Realms News: Duke Nukem 3D Source Code Released |url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2003/04/duke_nukem_3d_s_4.html |publisher=3D Realms |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |date=April 1, 2003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110202425/http://legacy.3drealms.com/news/2003/04/duke_nukem_3d_s_4.html |archivedate=November 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game content remains under a proprietary license. The game was quickly ported by enthusiasts to modern operating systems.

The first ''Duke Nukem 3D'' port was from icculus.org. It is a cross-platform project that allows the game to be played on [[AmigaOS]], [[AmigaOS 4]], [[AROS]], [[BeOS]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[MorphOS]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] rather than MS-DOS. The icculus.org codebase would later be used as the base for several other ports, including ''Duke3d_32''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duke3d_w32 |url=http://www.rancidmeat.com/project.php3?id=1 |website=Rancidmeat.com |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112023948/http://www.rancidmeat.com/project.php3?id=1 |archivedate=January 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular early project was Jonathon Fowler's ''JFDuke3D'', which, in December 2003, received backing from the original author of Build, programmer [[Ken Silverman]].&lt;ref name="jfduke3d"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonof.id.au/jfduke3d |title=JonoF's Duke Nukem 3D Port (JFDuke3D) |publisher=Jonathon Fowler |date=October 9, 2005 |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908150306/http://www.jonof.id.au/jfduke3d |archivedate=September 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler, in cooperation with Silverman, released a new version of ''JFDuke3D'' using [[Build engine#Polymost|Polymost]], an [[OpenGL]]-enhanced renderer for Build which allows hardware acceleration and 3D model support along with 32-bit color high resolution textures. Another project based on ''JFDuke3D'' called ''xDuke'', unrelated to the ''xDuke'' project based on ''Duke3d_w32'', runs on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. Silverman has since helped Fowler with a large portion of other engine work, including updating the network code, and helping to maintain various other aspects of the engine.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Development appears to have stopped; as of January 2015, there have been no new versions since October 9, 2005.

While a few short-lived [[DOS]]-based ''EDuke'' projects emerged, it was not until the release of ''EDuke32'', an extended version of ''Duke3D'' incorporating variants of both Fowler's [[Microsoft Windows]] ''JFDuke3D'' code, and Saettler's ''EDuke code'', by one of 3D Realms' forum moderators in late 2004, that ''EDuke's'' scripting extensions received community focus.&lt;ref name="eduke32"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eduke32.com/ |title=EDuke32 - Duke3D for Windows, Linux and OS X |publisher=Richard "TerminX" Gobeille |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922171805/http://www.eduke32.com/ |archivedate=September 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the various enhancements, support for advanced [[shader model]] 3.0 based graphics was added to ''EDuke32'' during late 2008-early 2009. In June 2008, thanks to significant porting contributions from the [[DOSBox]] team, ''EDuke32'' became the only ''Duke Nukem 3D'' source port to compile and run natively on [[64-bit]] Linux systems without the use of a 32-bit compatibility environment.

On April 1, 2009, an [[OpenGL]] Shader Model 3.0 renderer was revealed to have been developed for ''EDuke32'', named ''Polymer'' to distinguish from Ken Silverman's ''Polymost''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} It allows for much more modern effects such as dynamic lighting and [[normal mapping]]. Although Polymer is fully functional, it is technically incomplete and unoptimized, and is still in development. As of the fifth installment of the ''High Resolution Pack'', released in 2011, the Polymer renderer is mandatory. In 2011, another significant development of ''EDuke32'' was the introduction of true room over room (TROR), where sectors can be placed over other sectors, and can be seen at the same time. In practice, this allows for true three-dimensional level design that was previously impossible, although the base engine is still 2D.

On December 18, 2012, ''Chocolate Duke3D''&lt;ref name="ChocolateDuke3D"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/fabiensanglard/chocolate_duke3D |title=Chocolate Duke3D - Duke3D for Windows, Linux and OS X |publisher=Fabien Sanglard |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601174710/https://github.com/fabiensanglard/chocolate_duke3D |archivedate=June 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; port was released. Inspired by ''[[Chocolate Doom]]'',&lt;ref name="chocolateDoom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom |title=Doom - Duke3D | accessdate=September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the primary goal was to refactor the code so developers would easily read and learn from it.

In February 2013, a source [[code review]] article was published that described the internal working of the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duke Nukem 3D Code Review |url=http://fabiensanglard.net/duke3d/index.php |website=Fabien Sanglard's Website |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |date=February 14, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231175014/http://fabiensanglard.net/duke3d/index.php |archivedate=December 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All versions of the game have earned a positive aggregate score on [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]]. The original release on MS-DOS holds an aggregate score of 88.50% on GameRankings and a score of 89/100 on Metacritic.&lt;ref name="GR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; The version released on Sega Saturn holds an aggregate score of 82.50% on GameRankings.&lt;ref name= "GRS"/&gt; The version released on Xbox 360 holds an aggregate score of 80.67% on GameRankings while it holds a score of 80/100 on Metacritic.&lt;ref name= "GRX"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "MCX"/&gt; The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 63.80% on GameRankings.&lt;ref name="GRI"/&gt;

Daniel Jevons of ''Maximum'' gave it five out of five stars, calling it "absolutely perfect in every respect." He particularly cited the game's speed and fluidity even on low-end PCs, imaginative weapons, varied and identifiable environments, true 3D level designs, and strong multiplayer mode.&lt;ref name="Max7"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jevons |first=Daniel |title=Maximum Reviews: Duke Nukem 3D|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=7 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=June 1996|pages=128–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic summarized that "''Duke Nukem 3D'' has everything ''Doom'' doesn't, but it also doesn't leave out the stuff that made ''Doom'' a classic." He praised the imaginative weapons, long and complex single-player campaign, competitive multiplayer, built-in level editor, and parental lock.&lt;ref name="NG20"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=Doom to Dust?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=20 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=August 1996 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers paid a lot of attention to the sexual content within the game. Reception of this element varied: Tim Soete of [[GameSpot]] felt that it was "morally questionable",&lt;ref name="gamespotr" /&gt; while the [[Game Revolution]] reviewer noted that it was "done in a tongue-in-cheek manner," and he was "not personally offended".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duke Nukem 3D review for the PC|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/pc/duke-nukem-3d|date=June 5, 1996|work=[[Game Revolution]]|accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamingOnLinux]] reviewer Hamish Paul Wilson commented in a later retrospective how the game's "dark dystopian atmosphere filled with pornography and consumerist decadence" in his view helped to ground "the game's more outlandish and obscene moments in context", concluding that "in a world as perverse as this, someone like Duke becoming its hero seems almost inevitable."&lt;ref name="GamingOnLinux"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Hamish|url=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/the-big-three-build-engine-games-on-gog.5491|title=The Big Three Build Engine Games On GOG|publisher=[[GamingOnLinux]]|date=June 23, 2015|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Duke Nukem 3D'' was a finalist for [[CNET Gamecenter]]'s 1996 "Best Action Game" award, which ultimately went to ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''.&lt;ref name=gamecenter1996&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970205013139/http://www.gamecenter.com:80/Features/Exclusives/Awards96/indexa.html | url=http://www.gamecenter.com:80/Features/Exclusives/Awards96/indexa.html | title=The Gamecenter Awards for 96 | author=The Gamecenter Editors | work=[[CNET Gamecenter]] | archivedate=February 5, 1997 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, ''Next Generation'' ranked it as the 35th top game of all time, called "for many, the game ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' should have been."&lt;ref&gt;''Next Generation'' 21 (September 1996), p.59.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' named ''Duke Nukem 3D'' #37 overall among the best games of all time&lt;ref name="cgw199611best"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1996&amp;pub=2&amp;id=148 |title=150 Best Games of All Time |work=Computer Gaming World |date=November 1996 |accessdate=25 March 2016 |pages=64–80 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408023915/http://cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1996&amp;pub=2&amp;id=148 |archivedate=April 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and #13 among the "best ways to die in computer gaming".&lt;ref name="cgw199611bestwaystodie"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1996&amp;pub=2&amp;id=148 |title=The 15 Best Ways To Die In Computer Gaming |work=Computer Gaming World |date=November 1996 |accessdate=25 March 2016 |page=107 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408023915/http://cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1996&amp;pub=2&amp;id=148 |archivedate=April 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[PC Gamer]]'' magazine's readers' voted it #13 on its all-time top games poll.&lt;ref&gt;April 2000 issue&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of ''PC Game'' ranked it as the 12th top game of all time in 2001 citing the game's humor and pop-culture references,&lt;ref&gt;October 2001 issue&lt;/ref&gt; and as the 15th best games of all time in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;April 2005 issue&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' included it among the most important video games of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/international/games/features/110028.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520142756/http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/international/games/features/110028.shtml |archivedate=May 20, 2007|title=The 52 Most Important Video Games of All Time|work = [[GamePro]]|accessdate = December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[IGN]]'s Cam Shea ranked it as the ninth top 10 Xbox Live Arcade game, stating that it was as fun as it was in its initial release, and praised the ability to rewind to any point before the player died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IGN's Top 10 Xbox Live Arcade Games |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/980/980538p1.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |date=May 7, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413173841/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/980/980538p1.html |archivedate=April 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' reviewed the PlayStation console port, giving it a 21 out of 40 score.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&amp;a=page_h_title&amp;title_id=18596|title=デュークニューケム 〜トータル メルトダウン〜 [PS] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
''Duke Nukem 3D'' was attacked by some critics, who alleged that it promoted [[pornography]] and murder. Jamia Wilson, then vice president of [[Women's Media Center]], criticized the depictions of women for being "extremely harmful, especially to young women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Game's 'Capture the Babe' Mode Has Players Slapping Women |url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2011/03/25/duke-nukem-dustup-games-capture-babe-mode-players-slapping-women.html |first1=Jeremy A. |last1=Kaplan |first2=Patrick |last2=Manning |work=[[Fox News]] |publisher=[[Fox Entertainment Group]] |date=March 26, 2011 |accessdate=December 28, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230090602/http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2011/03/25/duke-nukem-dustup-games-capture-babe-mode-players-slapping-women.html |archivedate=December 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the criticism encountered, [[Censorship|censored]] versions of the game were released in certain countries in order to avoid it being banned altogether. A similar censored version was carried at [[Wal-Mart]] retail stores in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In Australia, the game was originally refused classification on release.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} 3D Realms repackaged the game with the parental lock feature permanently enabled, although a patch available on the 3D Realms website allowed the user to revert the game back into its uncensored U.S. version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duke Nukem 3D Patch Guide |url=http://dukertcm.com/knowledge-base/documents-online/setup-patch-guide-duke3d.html |website=Build RCTM |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426214020/http://dukertcm.com/knowledge-base/documents-online/setup-patch-guide-duke3d.html |archivedate=April 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)|OFLC]] then attempted to have the game pulled from the shelves, but it was discovered that the distributor had notified them of this fact and the rating could not be surrendered; six months later, the game was reclassified and released uncensored with an MA15+ rating.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In Germany, the [[Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien|BPjM]] placed the game on their "List B" ("List of Media Harmful to Young People") of videos games, thus prohibiting its advertisement in the public. However, it was not fully confiscated, meaning that an adult could still request to see the game and buy it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duke Nukem 3D for DOS |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/duke-nukem-3d |website=[[MobyGames]] |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102042353/http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/duke-nukem-3d |archivedate=January 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, ''Duke Nukem 3D'' was banned in Brazil, along with ''Doom'' and several other first-person shooters after a rampage, in and around a movie theater, was supposedly inspired by the first level in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2447352.html |title=Brazil Bans More Games |author=Micheal Mullen |publisher=GameSpot |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203140923/http://www.gamespot.com/news/2447352.html |archivedate=December 3, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such concerns from critics, legislators, and publishers, Scott Miller later recounted that 3D Realms saw very little negative feedback to the game's controversial elements from actual gamers or their parents.&lt;ref name="Barton99"/&gt; He pointed out that ''Duke Nukem 3D'' was appropriately rated "M" and had no real nudity, and speculated that that was enough to make it inoffensive to the general public.&lt;ref name="Barton99"/&gt;

'''English Canada''' is a term referring to one of the following:
# [[Canadian English|English-speaking Canadians]], as opposed to [[Canadian French|French-speaking Canadians]]. It is employed when comparing English- and French-language literature, media, or art. The 20% of Canadians whose native language is neither English nor French are either lumped into one of the two groups according to their knowledge and usage of the official language or classified separately as [[Allophone (Quebec)|allophones]].&lt;ref name="allophone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Allophone|url=http://www.parli.ca/allophone/|website=parli.ca|publisher=Campbell Strategies Inc.|accessdate=17 August 2017|location=Toronto|date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
# The Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] that have an [[English language|anglophone]] majority. This excludes the [[French language|francophone]] province of [[Quebec]] in total, and [[New Brunswick]] in part. Consequently, usage is usually in the context of geopolitical discussions involving Quebec. Among supporters of the two-nations theory, English-Canada is one of two founding nations, the other being French-Canada or Quebec.  In avoidance of the two-nations theory, English-Canada is often referred to as the "ROC" (Rest of Canada).
# ''[[English Canadians]]'', in some historical contexts, refers to Canadians who have origins in [[England]] (in contrast to [[Scottish Canadian]]s, [[Irish Canadian]]s etc.).

According to the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Census of Canada]], the population of English-speaking Canadians is between 17,882,775 and 24,423,375 while the population of the ROC is 23,805,130.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Estimates of Canadians with English origins is estimated to be about six million; a precise number is difficult to estimate for several reasons.  Another 6.7 million people reported their ethnicity as simply "Canadian" without further specification, which would include those with an admixture of multiple ethnicities, particularly those long present in Canada (e.g. French, Irish, English, and Scottish), making it possible that the number is much higher than the nearly 6 million who reported as having English origins.  On the other hand, historically, there have also been numerous Canadians who have hidden their true ancestry for different political reasons to join the dominant English group, such as to avoid discrimination, as seems to have been the case of the reported German-origin population, which dropped by nearly half after the First World War with a commensurate rise in reports of English origins.

'''''Fantasy Island''''' was an American television series that originally aired on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network from 1977 to 1984. It starred [[Ricardo Montalbán]] as the mysterious Mr. Roarke, who grants the fantasies of visitors to the island for a price. The series was created by [[Gene Levitt]]. A [[Fantasy Island (1998 TV series)|revival of the series]] aired on the same network 14 years later during the 1998–1999 season.

==Background==
Before it became a television series, ''Fantasy Island'' was introduced to viewers in 1977 and 1978 through two [[Television film|made-for-television films]]. Airing from 1978 to 1984, the original series starred [[Ricardo Montalbán]] as Mr. Roarke, the enigmatic overseer of a mysterious island somewhere in the [[Pacific Ocean]], where people from all walks of life could come and live out their fantasies, albeit for a price.

Roarke was known for his white suit and cultured demeanor, and was initially accompanied by an energetic [[sidekick]], Tattoo (played by [[Hervé Villechaize]]). Tattoo would run up the main bell tower to ring the bell and shout "[[Ze plane! Ze plane!]]" to announce the arrival of a new set of guests at the beginning of each episode. This line, shown at the beginning of the series' credits, became an unlikely [[catchphrase]] because of Villechaize's spirited delivery and French accent. In later seasons, he would arrive in his personal go-kart, sized for him, and recklessly drive to join Roarke for the visitor reception while the staff scrambled to get out of his way. From 1981 to 1982, [[Wendy Schaal]] joined the cast as a beautiful brown-eyed blonde assistant named Julie. The producers dismissed Villechaize from the series before the 1983–1984 season, which ended up being its last, and Tattoo was replaced by a more sedate [[butler]] type named Lawrence (played by [[Christopher Hewett]]), who pressed an electronic button to ring the bell rather than climb the tower himself. 

[[File:Ricardo Montalban Herve Villechaize Fantasy Island 1977.JPG|thumb|180px|Mr. Roarke and Tattoo]]

A [[Grumman G-44 Widgeon|Grumman Widgeon]] aircraft was used for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Love, Marianne |title=Plane lumbers into the good life service in World War II, gives way to splashy summers on North Idaho lakes |work=Spokesman Review (Spokane Edition) |date=July 27, 1999 |via=ProQuest Newsstand, ProQuest. Web }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just prior to the guests disembarking from the plane, Mr. Roarke would address his assembling employees with the phrase "Smiles, everyone! Smiles!". As each visitor exited the plane, Roarke would describe to Tattoo (or another assistant) the nature of their fantasy, usually with a cryptic comment suggesting the person's fantasy will not turn out as they expected. Roarke would then welcome his guests by lifting his glass and saying: "My dear guests, I am Mr. Roarke, your host. Welcome to Fantasy Island." This toast was usually followed with a warm smile but sometimes (depending on the nature of a guest or their fantasy) his eyes would show concern or worry for a guest's safety.

Very little is known about the man known only as Mr. Roarke. Many people close to him, including past lovers, have referred to him only as "Roarke". He is the sole owner and proprietor of Fantasy Island. Roarke's actual age is a complete mystery. In the pilot film, he comments how the guests who come to his island are "so mortal" and there are hints throughout the series that suggest Roarke may be immortal. In "Elizabeth", a woman from Roarke's past appears, but it is revealed that she died over 300 years ago. Other episodes suggests that he was friends with [[Helen of Troy]] and [[Cleopatra]]. However old he is, Roarke has come to know many seemingly-immortal beings over his time on Earth, including [[ghost]]s ("The Ghost's Story"), a [[Jinn|genie]] ("A Genie Named Joe"), the [[mermaid]] Princess Nyah ("The Mermaid", "The Mermaid Returns", "The Mermaid and the Matchmaker"), the goddess [[Aphrodite]] ("Aphrodite"), and [[Uriel]] the [[Death (personification)|Angel of Death]] ("The Angel's Triangle"). In "The Devil and Mandy Breem" and "The Devil and Mr. Roarke", Roarke even faces the [[Devil]] (played by [[Roddy McDowall]]) who has come to the island to challenge him for either a guest's immortal soul or his. It is mentioned this is not the first time they have confronted each other and Mr. Roarke has always been the winner. In the second story, the Devil was one of the island's guests, claiming he was only there to relax and had no interest in Roarke's soul at the time. However, this turned out to be yet another ruse.

Roarke had a strong moral code, but he was always merciful. He usually tried to teach his guests important life lessons through the medium of their fantasies, frequently in a manner that exposes the errors of their ways, and on occasions when the island hosted terminally ill guests he would allow them to live out one last wish. Roarke's fantasies were not without peril, but the greatest danger usually came from the guests themselves. In some cases, people were killed due to their own negligence, aggression or arrogance. When necessary, Roarke would directly intervene when the fantasy became dangerous to the guest:

* For instance in one episode when Tattoo was given his own fantasy as a birthday gift, which ended up with him being chased by hostile natives in canoes, Mr. Roarke suddenly appeared in a [[motorboat]], snared Tattoo's canoe with a grappling hook and towed it away at high speed to help him escape.
* Another instance was in "The Victim" where a female guest seeking to fall in love with her dream man ends up as one of his sex slaves. When she and her fellow slaves managed to get free, they are saved by Mr. Roarke and Tattoo who have arrived with the police who then arrest the two men responsible.
* Another instance was in the 1980 episode "With Affection, Jack the Ripper" when a female guest intent on researching [[Jack the Ripper]]'s crimes was sent back in time to that of 1888 [[London]] and would have become one of the Ripper's victims had not Mr. Roarke physically intervened.

With only a few exceptions, Roarke always made it quite clear that he was powerless to stop a fantasy once it had begun and that guests must play them out to their conclusion.

In later seasons, there were often [[supernatural]] overtones. Roarke also seemed to have his own supernatural powers of some sort (called the "Gift of the McNabs" in "Delphine"), although it was never explained how this came to be. In the episodes "Reprisal" and "The Power" he temporarily gave the guest psychokinetic abilities and in "Terrors of the Mind" the power to see into the future. In one episode, when a guest says "Thank God things worked out well", Roarke and Tattoo share an odd look and Roarke says in a cryptic way "Thank God, indeed." In the same episode, Roarke uses some mysterious powers to help Tattoo with his magic act. Ricardo Montalban would claim in interviews that he had a definite opinion in mind regarding the mystery of Mr. Roarke, and how he accomplished his fantasies, but he would never publicly state what it was. Years after the series was off the air, in an interview with the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, Montalban finally revealed that his motivation was imagining Roarke as a fallen angel whose sin was pride and that Fantasy Island was purgatory.

Each episode would alternate between two or three independent storylines as the guests experienced their fantasies and interacted with Roarke. When reruns of the series went into syndication, a half-hour version was offered, in which each hour-long original show was split to two separate half-hour shows in which only one guest's story was told in each half-hour episode. This made it obvious that the original episodes had been planned in such a way that each guest or family got off the plane separately, did not interact with the other guest or family, and was given almost exactly half the time of the original episode.

Often the fantasies would turn out to be morality lessons for the guests. For example, one featured a couple who clamored for the "good old days" being taken back to the [[Salem witch trials]], sometimes to the point of (apparently) putting their lives at risk, only to have Roarke step in at the last minute and reveal the deception. It is mentioned a few times that a condition of visiting Fantasy Island is that guests never reveal what goes on there. A small number of guests decided to make the irrevocable choice to stay permanently, living out their fantasy until death; one such person was an actor who had been in a [[Tarzan]]-type television series called "Jungle Man" in the 1960s. Aside from a [[clip show]] ("Remember...When?") the only episode with a single storyline was "The Wedding", in which terminally ill Helena Marsh ([[Samantha Eggar]]) returned to Fantasy Island to spend her last days as Roarke's wife.

===The Fantasy===

====Cost====
In the first film, it was noted that each guest had paid $50,000 (about ${{Inflation|US|50000|1977|fmt=c|r=-3}} in {{Inflation year|US}} dollars) in advance for the fulfillment of their fantasies and that Fantasy Island was a business. In ''Return to Fantasy Island'', Roarke told Tattoo that he sometimes dropped the price when a guest couldn't afford the usual fee because he believed everyone should be given a chance to have their fantasies fulfilled. Afterwards, it became clear that the price a guest paid was substantial to him or her, and for one little girl whose father was one of Roarke's guests, she had emptied her piggy bank (which contained less than ten dollars) to have her fantasy with her father fulfilled. On numerous occasions, a guest had not paid for the trip at all but instead won it as a result of a contest. Those who came by winning contests were usually the unknowing beneficiaries of rigged contests in order to disguise to themselves and others the real reason for their coming as part of someone else's fantasy.

====Nature====
The nature of a fantasy varied from story to story and were typically very personal to each guest on some level. They could be as harmless as wanting to be reunited with a lost love to something more dangerous like tracking down a cold-blooded killer who murdered someone close to the guest. Usually, the fantasy would take an unexpected turn and proceed down a quite different path than the guest expected. Some resolve in "[[The Monkey's Paw]]" style. He or she would then leave with some new revelation or renewed interest about themselves or someone close to them. Many times, Roarke would reveal in the end that someone they met during the course of their fantasy was another guest living a fantasy of their own. Both guests often left the island together. However, in one episode, one guest had no particular fantasy and was simply there to relax and enjoy himself. In another episode, one guest's ([[Don Knotts]]) fantasy was to play the part of a private eye. At the end of the episode, he discovers that his 'suspects' were actually a company of actors who had asked Mr. Roarke to act out their 'whodunnit' play in a realistic setting.

Although some fantasies were rooted in the real world, many others involved supernatural (such as ghosts, [[demon]]s, or [[witchcraft]]) or mythological (mermaids, genies, Greek goddesses) elements. Time-travel was often a required element, if not a specific request, to fulfill one's fantasy.

====Risk====
Roarke often preceded particularly risky fantasies with a stern warning, word of caution, or even suggestion that the guest select another fantasy instead. He would then inform his guests that he was powerless to stop a fantasy once it had begun and must allow the fantasy to play out until its ultimate conclusion. Despite this, on rare occasions, Roarke will appear halfway through a fantasy to offer a guest an opportunity to terminate their fantasy, warning the guest that continuing the fantasy may lead to serious consequences (possibly even death). However, at that point, the guest will decide on their own to see the fantasy to its end, either for selfless reasons (regarding someone they had met during the fantasy) or naivety of what is in store for them. In the most serious cases, however, Roarke would invariably intervene and ensure his guests' safety.

==Production notes==
[[File:Queen Anne House Los Angeles.JPG|thumb|right|[[Queen Anne Cottage and Coach Barn]] in [[Arcadia, California]].]]
[[Aaron Spelling]] admitted the original pitch was a joke. Spelling and production partner [[Leonard Goldberg]] were pitching ideas to ABC executive Brandon Stoddard. After the executive rejected all of their plans, at least six in all, Spelling blurted out: "What do you want? An island that people can go to and all of their sexual fantasies will be realized?" Stoddard loved the idea.&lt;ref name="plane" /&gt;

The network wanted [[Orson Welles]] for Mr. Roarke, but Spelling rejected him, knowing of his irritable nature on sets.&lt;ref name="plane"&gt;[http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/aaron-spelling# Interview with Aaron Spelling]. ''Archive of American Television'' (November 18–24, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; He also rejected the idea of a sexy female sidekick to join Roarke and Tattoo.&lt;ref name="plane" /&gt;

The show was broadcast every Saturday night on ABC at 10:00, after ''[[The Love Boat]]'', which was also produced by Aaron Spelling. Like several other series of the era, such as ''The Love Boat'' and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', ''Fantasy Island'' employed many celebrity guest stars, often bringing them back repeatedly for different roles.

===Filming locations===
The series was filmed primarily in [[Burbank, California]], with the opening scenes of the enchanting island coastline being that of [[Kauai]], Hawaii (both the [[Nā Pali Coast State Park|Na Pali coast]] as well as [[Wailua Falls]]). The house with the bell tower, where Tattoo rings the bell, is the [[Queen Anne Cottage and Coach Barn|Queen Anne Cottage]], located in the [[Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden]] in [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]]. The plane, "arriving" with the guests, was filmed in the lagoon behind the Queen Anne Cottage. Sometimes, outdoor scenes were filmed at the Arboretum.

Interior sets were filmed on Stages 26 and 17 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/warnerbros/stage17.php|title=Warner Bros – Stage 17|publisher=theStudioTour.com|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some point, the production of exterior scenes moved to the Warner Ranch a short distance away from Warner's main lot.

===Music===
The Fantasy Island theme music was composed by [[Laurence Rosenthal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Terrace |first=Vincent |title=Encyclopedia of Television Series, Pilots and Specials, Volume 2 |date=1985 |publisher=VNR AG |isbn=0918432618 |page=139, 500 |url=https://books.google.it/books?id=AKlgjBCPPnsC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=fantasy+island+music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sA8YVGjXey&amp;sig=wsm10ilVvwI3Tnhj2V9qKP4MbDI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjm29rnnL3bAhWEHpoKHSemAiQQ6AEIezAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=fantasy%20island%20music&amp;f=false |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reboots==
===1998 revival series===
{{Main article|Fantasy Island (1998 TV series)}}
In 1998, ABC revived the series in a Saturday time slot. The role of Mr. Roarke was played by [[Malcolm McDowell]] in the revival, and in contrast to the first series the supernatural aspect of his character and of Fantasy Island itself was emphasized from the start, along with a dose of dark humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Howard|last=Rosenberg|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/26/entertainment/ca-26449|title= If Your Fantasy Is Fascinating Shows, Forget It; TV reviews: 'Fantasy Island' treads water; 'Martial Law,' 'Cupid' don't zing.|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 26, 1998|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], known for his work on ''[[The Addams Family]]'' movies, was a chief creative force on the new series. Another difference was that the new series was filmed in [[Hawaii]] instead of [[California]]. The remake followed the fantasies of at least two of Roarke's guests with an additional subplot involving members of his staff&amp;nbsp;– usually Cal and Harry. Whereas the original series featured a separate writer and title for each subplot, the new series was written as several stories but featuring a unified theme and title.

===Film adaptation===
On July 31, 2018, it was announced that a film adaptation of the television series is in the works. [[Sony Pictures]] will release the film and be produced by [[Blumhouse Productions]]. ''[[Truth or Dare (2018 film)|Truth or Dare]]'' director and co-screenwriter [[Jeff Wadlow]] will direct the remake from a script by Wadlow, Chris Roach, and Jillian Jacobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/fantasy-island-blumhouse-sony-jeff-wadlow-1202437470/|title=‘Fantasy Island’ Film On Tap For Blumhouse, Sony &amp; Director Jeff Wadlow|date=July 31, 2018|accessdate=August 1, 2018|publisher=[[Deadline (magazine)|Deadline]]|author=Mike Fleming Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, the film is set to released on February 28, 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3535956/sony-blumhouses-fantasy-island-horror-film-set-release-2020/|title=Sony and Blumhouse’s ‘Fantasy Island’ is a Horror Film; Set for Release in 2020!|author=Brad Miska|accessdate=December 2, 2018|publisher=''[[Bloody Disgusting]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syndication==
Selected episodes from the first, second and third seasons are available free at [[Hulu]]. Selected [[The Minisode Network|Minisodes]] from seasons one, three, four, five, and six are available free at [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]], along with complete episodes from seasons one, two, and three.

Digital multicast television network [[Cozi TV]] announced the series would be airing on the network beginning fall 2013. Episodes of the original series were seen on Fridays on sister cable network [[Universal HD]], until July 2017, when the network changed to the [[Olympic Channel]].

In Canada, episodes of the original series aired during primetime some evenings and again on the weekend on TV Land (now [[Comedy Gold (TV channel)|Comedy Gold]]).

In Greece, episodes are aired very early in the morning (sometimes 04.00-04.30) every day on [[Mega Channel]].

==Home media==

===Original series===
In 1988, Star Classics released the pilot episode of the series on VHS in the United States and Canada.

In 2005, [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] released Season 1 of the original series on DVD in regions 1, 2 &amp; 4. The release included the 1977 pilot ''Fantasy Island'' and 1978's ''Return to Fantasy Island''. However, due to poor sales, no further seasons were released.

In February 2012, it was announced that [[Shout! Factory]] had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1; they subsequently released the second season on DVD on May 8, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Fantasy-Island-Season-2/16517 |title=Fantasy Island DVD news: Press Release for Fantasy Island - The Complete 2nd Season |website=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717122711/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Fantasy-Island-Season-2/16517 |archivedate=July 17, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Season 3 was released on October 23, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Fantasy-Island-Season-3/17195 |title=Fantasy Island - My Dear Guests, Welcome, to The Complete 3rd Season on DVD! |website=TVShowsOnDVD.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914084918/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Fantasy-Island-Season-3/17195 |archivedate=September 14, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flag of [[Belize]]''' was adopted on 21 September 1981, the [[September Celebrations|day]] Belize became independent. It consists of the [[coat of arms of Belize|Coat of Arms]] on a blue field with red stripes at the top and bottom.

British Honduras obtained a [[Coat of arms of Belize|coat of arms]] on 28 January 1907, which formed the basis of the badge used on British ensigns. The coat of arms recalls the logging industry that first led to British settlement there. The figures, tools, and mahogany tree represent this industry. The national motto, ''Sub Umbra Floreo'', meaning "Under the Shade I Flourish", is written in the lower part of the coat of arms.

== Description ==
The flag is royal blue, with a white disc at the centre containing the [[Coat of Arms of Belize|national coat of arms]] held by a mestizo and a man of African descent. The flag of Belize is the only country to have humans depicted as a major design element on its national flag, although the [[flag of Malta]] contains an image of [[Saint George]] on the badge of the [[George Cross]], and the flags of British overseas territories [[Flag of Montserrat|Montserrat]] and [[Flag of the British Virgin Islands|the Virgin Islands]], and that of [[Flag of French Polynesia|French Polynesia]] also depict humans. &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.belize.com/belize-flag|title=Belize Flag, Coat of Arms|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag is bordered at top and bottom by two red stripes.

The colours on the flag are respectively those of the country's national parties, the [[People's United Party]] (PUP) and [[United Democratic Party (Belize)]] (UDP). The UDP, established in 1973, had objected to the original blue and white design, those two colours being the PUP's representative colours.

The two red stripes at the top and bottom were added to the original design at independence. The coat of arms was granted in 1907. Red stripes were added to denote the colour of the opposition party. The 50 leaves recall 1950, the year PUP came to power.

== History ==
From 1950 onward, an unofficial national flag was in use. It was blue, with the coat of arms on a white disc in the centre (sometimes a blank white circle was used as the coat of arms was difficult to draw). 

In 1981, Belize gained its independence and a competition was held to design a national flag for the country. The winning submission consisted of the unofficial national flag used by the [[People's United Party]] with a red border added to all four sides. This was changed to a red border on just the top and bottom before the design was officially adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Waight, Sanchez Win National Flag Competition|journal=The Voice|date=August 7, 1981|volume=1|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3141">In [[materials science]], '''galfenol''' is the general term for an [[alloy]] of [[iron]] and [[gallium]]. The name was first given to iron-gallium alloys by [[Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center|United States Navy researchers]] in 1998 when they discovered that adding gallium to iron could amplify iron's [[magnetostrictive]] effect up to tenfold. Galfenol is of interest to [[sonar]] researchers because magnetostrictor materials are used to detect sound, and amplifying the magnetostrictive effect could lead to better sensitivity of sonar detectors.&lt;ref name="news157207921"&gt;{{cite web| title=Scientists spy Galfenol's inner beauty mark | date=2009-03-25 | publisher=PhysOrg.com | url=http://www.physorg.com/news157207921.html | accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galfenol is also proposed for vibrational energy harvesting, actuators for precision machine tools, active anti-vibration systems, and anti-clogging devices for sifting screens and spray nozzles. Galfenol is machinable and can be produced in sheet and wire form.&lt;ref name="Ames1"&gt;{{cite web| title=Ames Laboratory, Etrema Products Inc., and Navy researchers discover new uses for high tech alloy | date=2012-08-21 | publisher=Ames Laboratory | url=http://www.ameslab.gov/news/news-releases/ames-laboratory-etrema-products-inc-and-navy-researchers-discover-new-uses-high-t | accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Etrema1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Etrema Products Industries/Applications |publisher=Etrema Products, Inc. |url=http://www.etrema-usa.com/industries/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031030123704/http://etrema-usa.com/industries/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-10-30 |accessdate=2012-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, scientists from [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]], and [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) used [[neutron]] beams to determine the [[Crystal structure|structure]] of galfenol. They determined that the addition of gallium changes the lattice structure of the iron atoms from regular cubic cells to one in which the faces of some of the cells become slightly rectangular. The elongated cells tend to clump together in the alloy, forming localized clumps within the material. These clumps have been described by Peter Gehring of the NIST Center for Neutron Research as "something like raisins within a cake".&lt;ref name="news157207921" /&gt;

'''''Gamer''''' is  a 2009 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film]] written and directed by [[Mark Neveldine]] and [[Brian Taylor (filmmaker)|Brian Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35445/exclusive-behind-scenes-clip-gamer |title=Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Clip - Gamer |work=DreadCentral |date=January 20, 2010 |accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film stars [[Gerard Butler]] as a participant in an [[online game]] in which participants can [[mind control|control]] human beings as players, and [[Logan Lerman]] as the player who controls him. Alongside Butler and Lerman, it also stars [[Michael C. Hall]], [[Ludacris]], [[Amber Valletta]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Alison Lohman]], [[John Leguizamo]], and [[Zoë Bell]].

''Gamer'' was released in North America on September 4, 2009, receiving generally negative reviews from critics, who found the plot, direction, and script disappointing, though its performances, effects, and action sequences were praised. It received a mixed reception from audiences, and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $43 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million.

==Plot==
In 2034, [[computer programmer]] Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall) invents self-replicating [[nanite]]s that replace brain tissue and allow humans to control other humans' actions and see through their eyes.  The first application of Castle's "Nanex" technology is a [[virtual community]] [[life simulation game]], ''Society'', which allows [[gamer]]s to manipulate live actors as their [[avatar (computing)|avatar]]s.  ''Society'' becomes a worldwide sensation, making Castle the richest man in the world.  He then creates ''Slayers'', a [[first-person shooter]] where the "characters" are [[death-row]] prisoners using real weapons in specially created arenas.  Unlike ''Society'' actors, ''Slayers'' participants are not paid; instead, they volunteer in exchange for the promise that any Slayer who survives 30 matches will earn his freedom (though no one ever has).  

John "Kable" Tillman (Butler) is the crowd's favorite, having survived a record 27 matches. He is exclusively controlled by Simon (Lerman), a seventeen-year-old superstar gamer from a wealthy family. 

An activist organization called the "Humanz" hacks a talk-show interview with Castle and claims that his technology will one day be used to [[mind control|control people against their will]]. The Humanz also disrupt ''Society'' play, but Castle sees both these actions as trivial.  However, Castle feels threatened by Kable's winning streak, and introduces a new inmate into ''Slayers'', Hackman (Crews), specifically to kill Kable.  Unknown to anyone else, Hackman will not be controlled by a player, and thus not be handicapped by the [[Lag (online gaming)|"ping"]] that causes a small but dangerous delay between the player's command and the Slayer's action. 

Kable/Tillman's wife, Angie (Valletta), works as a ''Society'' character, but in spite of her earnings, she is refused custody of their daughter Delia, who has been placed with a wealthy family. 

The Humanz contact Kable and Simon separately, warning them that Castle has no intention of letting Kable survive, and offer to create a [[Mod (gaming)|mod]] that will let him escape, but only if Simon relinquishes control during the game.  The escape is successful, and news outlets report that Kable has been [[fragging|fragged]], which puts Simon in a difficult position: he is labelled a "cheater", locked out of his bank account, and investigated by the [[FBI]] for helping Kable escape.

Tillman is brought to the Humanz' hideout; he refuses to help their fight against Castle, but learns of Angie's current location in ''Society''.  He rescues her, escaping from both Hackman and Castle's security forces. They are met by Gina (Sedgwick), the talk show host, secretly assisting the Humanz.  The Humanz deactivate the nanites in Angie and Tillman's brains, and Tillman remembers that the original nanites were tested on him while he was still in the military.  Under Castle's control, Tillman shot and killed his best friend, and was imprisoned.

Upon learning that Castle is the wealthy father who adopted Delia, Tillman infiltrates his mansion to get her back. He locates Castle, who  reveals that his henchmen have already tracked down the Humanz' lair and killed all of them.  He also reveals that 98% of his own brain has been replaced with nanites, but his allow him to control others, rather than be controlled.  He plans to release air-borne nanites which will infect the entire United States within six months, giving him ultimate control. Hackman attacks Tillman, who easily kills him.  Tillman then attacks Castle, but is frozen in place, as Castle explains that his men have reactivated his and Angie's nanites.

Unknown to Castle, Gina and Trace (Lohman) escaped the murder of the Humanz, and patch into the Nanex, revealing the confrontation to the world and exposing Castle's plans.  It also unblocks Simon's account and restores his control of Tillman.

Castle tries to manipulate Tillman into killing his own daughter, but he resists, and then Simon's control allows him to attack Castle.  He and Simon wrestle for control over Tillman, but Tillman tells Castle to imagine Tillman's knife stabbing him. Castle unconsciously does so, allowing Tillman to kill him and removing his control over everyone.  With Castle dead, Tillman convinces his technicians to deactivate the Nanex, freeing all the "characters" in ''Society'' and ''Slayers''.

The film closes with the Tillman family taking a trip down a country road, ending with the words "Game Over".

==Production==
===Development===
In May 2007, [[Lakeshore Entertainment]] re-teamed with [[Mark Neveldine]] and [[Brian Taylor (filmmaker)|Brian Taylor]], the creators of ''[[Crank (film)|Crank]]'' (2006), to produce a "high-concept futuristic thriller" called ''Game''. Neveldine and Taylor wrote the script for ''Game'' and were slated to direct the film, while actor [[Gerard Butler]] was cast into the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Elizabeth |last=Guider |date=May 16, 2007 |url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=Cannes2007&amp;jump=story&amp;id=1061&amp;articleid=VR1117965070&amp;cs=1 |title=Lakeshore, Butler to play ''Game'' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=December 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] for a 53-day shoot. Filming was at the Albuquerque Studios and on location around Albuquerque. Multistory sets were built on parking lots in downtown Albuquerque to depict buildings that were blown up in the film, and other sets were built on the back lots near the studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Megan |last=Kamerick |date=August 31, 2007 |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/stories/2007/08/27/daily26.html |title=New film production fills Albuquerque Studios |work=New Mexico Business Weekly |accessdate=December 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew used special hand-held [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red One]] digital cameras, which allowed the special effects team to begin work normally done in post-production after each day's shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Edward |last=Douglas |date=November 19, 2007 |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=39355 |title=On the Set of Gerard Butler's New Sci-Fi Action Flick! |work=ComingSoon |accessdate=December 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title===
In March 2009, the film's working title was changed from ''Game'' to ''Citizen Game''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/objects/907/907044.html |title=IGN: Citizen Game Trailer, Wallpaper, Pictures, Soundtrack and More |publisher=IGN |accessdate=April 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422195347/http://uk.movies.ign.com/objects/907/907044.html |archivedate=April 22, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lionsgatepublicity.com/epk/citizengame/ |title=Lionsgate Publicity |publisher=Lionsgate Publicity |accessdate=April 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721105625/http://www.lionsgatepublicity.com/epk/citizengame/ |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, another name change was announced, the new name being ''Gamer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gamerthemovie.com |title=Gamer – In Theaters September 4 |publisher=Gamerthemovie.com |accessdate=May 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313045718/http://gamerthemovie.com/ |archivedate=March 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movieblog.ugo.com/movies/gamer-poster |title=Exclusive Poster Premiere: Gamer - UGO.com |publisher=Movieblog.ugo.com |accessdate=May 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511074605/http://movieblog.ugo.com/movies/gamer-poster |archivedate=May 11, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quietearth.us/articles/2009/05/08/Yet-another-name-change-for-GAME--new-motion-poster |title=Updated: Another name change for Game + new motion poster + Trailer on Xbox live |publisher=Quietearth.us |accessdate=May 9, 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66VDmZAGa?url=http://www.quietearth.us/articles/2009/05/08/Yet-another-name-change-for-GAME--new-motion-poster |archive-date=March 28, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
===Box office===
''Gamer'' had an opening day gross of $3.3 million and ranked fourth at the box office. In total, the film earned $9.2 million in its opening weekend. Overall, the film grossed $21.5 in the United States and Canadian and $20.7 million in other territories for worldwide cumulative of $42 million, against its $50 million budget.&lt;ref name="NUM"/&gt;

===Critical reception===
The film received negative reviews from critics. The film holds a 28% "Rotten" rating from 75 reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]; the site's consensus being "with all of the hyperkinetic action and none of the flair of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor's earlier work, ''Gamer'' has little replay value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gamer/ |title=Gamer |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic Joe Neumaier of The ''[[New York Daily News]]'', agreed, calling it a "[[photocopy|Xerox]] of a Xerox" and citing a number of films it supposedly takes elements from, including ''[[The Matrix]]'' and ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2009/09/04/2009-09-04_for_gerard_butler_gamer_is_a_losing_bet.html |title=''New York Daily News'' reviewed negatively of ''Gamer'' |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |first=Joe |last=Neumaier |date=September 4, 2009 |accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[RVA Magazine]]'' noted that ''Gamer''{{'}}s plot was overly similar to ''[[The Condemned]]'' and commented that ''Gamer'' "hates its primary audience" and "tries to criticize the [[commercialization]] of violence, even though it itself is commercialized violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rvamag.com/articles/full/4893/film-review-gamer |title=''RVA''{{'}}s review of ''Gamer'' |work=[[RVA Magazine]] |date=September 4, 2009 |accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural critic [[Steven Shaviro]] authored a 10,000 word defense and analysis of the film that he posted online, and eventually re-worked into the penultimate chapter of his book, ''Post-Cinematic Affect'' (Zer0 Books, 2010).&lt;ref name="shaviro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shaviro.com/Blog/?p=830 |title=Gamer |publisher=[[Steven Shaviro]] |accessdate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graduation''' is getting a diploma or [[academic degree]] or the ceremony that is sometimes associated with it, in which students become [[Alumnus|graduates]].  Before the graduation, candidates are referred to as graduands. The date of graduation is often called '''graduation day'''. The graduation ceremony itself is also called '''commencement''', '''convocation''' or '''invocation'''. Normally, the ceremony and name apply to high school and above (the next ascending levels being Associate's, Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctorate). In the United States of America, graduations for elementary school or even Kindergarten have been a development of recent years. When ceremonies are associated, they usually include a procession of the academic staff and candidates and a [[valediction]]. At the college and university level the faculty will usually wear [[academic dress]] at the formal ceremonies, as will the [[trustees]] and degree candidates.

"Graduation" at the college and university level occurs when the presiding officer confers degrees upon candidates, either individually or en masse, even if graduates physically receive their diploma later at a smaller college or [[academic department|departmental]] ceremony. After degree completion, graduates can be referred to by their graduating year.

In some places, [[Party#Graduation party|graduation parties]] to celebrate graduation from school, college or university are popular. In a recent 2014 nationwide survey in the United States, $985 was the average amount spent on graduation parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graduationparty.com/graduation-party-budgeting.htm|title=Graduation Party Budget|work=graduationparty.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a student graduates without attending the ceremony, then it is called '''graduation ''[[in absentia]]'''''.

==By country==
{{Further|Academic graduation by country}}

The procedures and traditions surrounding academic graduation ceremonies differ around the world. Whereas in the United Kingdom a graduation usually only occurs at university level, in the United States of America and many other countries graduations also occur at high schools where no higher education qualifications are conferred upon the graduates. In a graduation ceremony the students dress up in special graduation caps and clothing that are made just for this purpose.

Graduation traditions are varied across universities observing different cultures. Most universities across Sweden are research-oriented and may present its students with bachelor's, master's, and doctor's degrees covering all academic streams. Universities across the country are based through the Higher Education Ordinance. A large number of candidates continue their education onto secondary and upper secondary education. Most of the national programs provide Swedish, English, Math and Science among majors.

In Zimbabwe, graduation ceremonies are often associated with the guest of honor who most of is the ceremonial head of the institution. At state universities the President of Zimbabwe officiates as chancellor and guest of honor. Every graduate of a state university in Zimbabwe can claim to have shaken the President's hand. The person most associated with graduation at those institutions is Zimbabwe's ex-President Robert Gabriel Mugabe. At other State Institutions of higher learning the vice Presidents or any other Senior Government officials may preside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = President Mugabe caps 1 986 at Nust {{!}} The Herald|url = http://www.herald.co.zw/president-mugabe-caps-1-986-at-nust/|website = www.herald.co.zw|accessdate = 2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of graduation==
Ceremonies for graduating students date from the first universities in Europe in the 12th century. At that time Latin was the language of scholarship. A "universitas" was a guild of masters (MAs) with licence to teach. "Degree" and "graduate" come from gradus, meaning "step". The first step was admission to a bachelor's degree. The second step was the masters step, giving the graduate admission to the universitas and license to teach. The typical dress for graduation are gowns and hoods or hats adapted from the daily dress of university staff in the Middle Ages, which was in turn based on the attire worn by medieval clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Graduation through the ages http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/graduation/grad-history.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of wearing graduation hats in Sweden has been in place since the mid 18th century. The cap is typically a white sailor hat with a black or dark blue band around it, a crown motif, and a black peak at the front. The graduation hat tradition was initially brought into practice by students at [[Uppsala University]]. The headgear then became popular across several other European nations as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8202511/Swedish_high_school_graduation_day|title=Swedish high school graduation day|author=Elin Olsson|work=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4584">[[Image:Hey matey 001.jpg|thumb|A typical design of a [[Māori people|Māori]] hei matau]]
A '''''hei matau''''' is a [[bone]] or [[Pounamu|greenstone]] carving in the shape of a highly stylised [[fish hook]] typical of the [[Māori people]] of [[New Zealand]].
They represent strength, good luck and safe travel across water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boneart.co.nz/meanings.htm Some Basic Design Elements &amp; Their Meanings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
The fish-hook shape of the ''hei matau'' means to know, which holds that the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]] was once a huge fish that was caught by the great mariner [[Māui (Māori mythology)|Maui]] using only a woven line and a hook made from the jawbone of his grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maori.info/maori_history.htm Te Matau a Maui]&lt;/ref&gt; Legend holds that the shape of [[Hawke Bay]] is that of the hei matau, which caught in the fish's side on the beach. The Māori name for the North island, ''Te Ika a Maui'' ("The fish of Maui") reflects this legend.

For the Māori, the ''hei matau'' is [[taonga]] (a cultural treasure). It represents not only their land, but also prosperity, fertility and safe passage over water. They also denote the importance of fishing to Māori, and their relationship to [[Tangaroa]] god of the sea.

==Materials and methods==
[[File:Pounamu pendant.jpg|thumb|upright|Modern hei matau, made of [[pounamu]]]]

Traditionally, ''matau'', or fishhooks, were carved from bone, ivory, shell, wood, or [[pounamu]]; composite hooks were also common.&lt;ref name=tradhooks&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 23| pages = 1–8| last = Paulin| first = Chris| title = The traditional Mäori ‘internal-barb’ fishhook| journal = Tuhinga: Records of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa| accessdate = 2016-09-07| date = 2012| url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Publication/3731}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa| title = Traditional Maori fish hooks and trolling lures| accessdate = 2016-09-07| date = 2006| url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Topic/1467}}&lt;/ref&gt; They came in several different forms. There are multiple apparently functional matau forms, but the functions of some are not known.&lt;ref name=tradhooks/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 20| pages = 15–21| last = Paulin| first = Chris| title = Porotaka hei matau - a traditional Maori tool?| journal = Tuhinga: Records of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa| accessdate = 2016-09-07| date = 2009| url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Publication/3154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some were plain and utilitarian; others highly ornate. They were worn as pendants for safekeeping, and were often treasured family heirlooms.

Today, their main use is ornamental and they are commonly worn around the neck not only by Māori, but also by other New Zealanders who identify with the ''hei matau'' as a symbol of New Zealand. They are also popular items on the tourist market. Many modern pendants are not functional fish hooks.

In contemporary times, ''hei matau'' are commonly carved from cattle bone. Some Māori carvers continue to use whale bone, and such pieces are highly valued not only because of the beauty of whale bone and its cultural and historical significance, but also its scarcity. Current laws against hunting whales mean that Māori bone-carvers who carve in whale bone must use a combination of ancient standings or pre-existing supplies, or bones from whales that have recently beached. According to New Zealand tradition and law, Māori have first claim on part of the skeletons of any whales which strand and cannot be refloated. This is, however, a very limited supply.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Mass production===
Manufacturers in [[China]] mass-produce items resembling ''hei matau'' for sale on the New Zealand tourist market. These are usually made of a paste of bone and resin. Such manufacturers have attracted criticism for their appropriation of Māori designs.

The '''Hill Museum &amp; Manuscript Library''' (HMML) is a non-profit organization located at and sponsored by [[Saint John's Abbey, Collegeville|Saint John's Abbey]] and [[College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University|University]] in [[Collegeville, Minnesota]]. HMML’s mission is to identify, digitally photograph, catalog, and archive the contents of [[manuscripts]] belonging to threatened communities and to make the copies available to users around the world through online catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmml.org/frequently-asked-questions.html "HMML: Frequently Asked Questions"], ''Hill Museum &amp; Manuscript Library''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding in 1965, HMML has partnered with 540 libraries and archives to photograph more than 140,000 manuscript books dating from the ancient to early modern eras, totaling some 40,000,000 handwritten pages. HMML serves three constituencies: communities or libraries with endangered manuscript collections; scholars who research manuscript and textual history; and the non-specialist general public interested in the transmission of human knowledge and artistic creativity in manuscript form.

In October 2015, HMML launched a new and comprehensive online resource for manuscript studies, vHMML or “Virtual HMML." at www.vhmml.org. A crucial extension of vHMML, vHMML Reading Room, went live at the end in the summer of 2016: https://www.vhmml.org/readingRoom/. vHMML Reading Room gives registered users access to HMML’s photographic manuscript archives from around the world. The initial collections available in vHMML Reading Room include representative samples of HMML’s diverse microfilm and digital resources, including images from Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and India. Highlights include manuscripts from Iraq and the famed Timbuktu manuscripts of Mali.

Over 6,000 complete manuscripts in thirty languages are now in vHMML Reading Room. vHMML Reading Room lets users search for manuscripts by country, repository, author, language, genre, date, features, city or even script. Even uncataloged collections will be hosted in vHMML Reading Room, lowering all barriers to scholarly access. Users can contribute cataloging metadata using a simple tool only a click away. Researchers can view a highly-zoomable single page or view the manuscript as a larger whole.

In addition to its manuscript collections, HMML holds works of art and rare printed books from the Middle Ages to the present &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csbsju.edu/Academics/Academic-Catalogs/2011-2012-catalog/SJU-overview/HMML.htm/ "Hill Museum &amp; Manuscript Library (HMML)"], ''College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University''.&lt;/ref&gt; and is home to ''[[The Saint John's Bible]]'', the first handwritten and illuminated Bible to have been commissioned by a Benedictine Abbey since the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]] in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintjohnsbible.org/process/principles_bible.htm/ "A Bible for the Times"], ''The Saint John's Bible''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003, [[Columba Stewart]], a monk of Saint John's Abbey, has served as HMML's executive director. HMML is located in the Alcuin Library, designed by Hungarian architect [[Marcel Breuer]].

==How HMML Operates==

HMML serves as the preservation archive in the event that original manuscripts are destroyed, stolen, or otherwise lost. For each collection to be digitized, HMML signs a contract with the owners of the manuscripts, who then receive copies of the images and retain commercial and publication rights. Collections never leave the owners. On-site digitizing work is done by local technicians trained and paid by HMML.  Administrative and funding activities are based at HMML’s location in Collegeville, Minnesota, while catalogers from both Collegeville as well as from several countries contribute to the creation of metadata for the recently-digitized manuscripts. In addition, HMML maintains a field office in Beirut, Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/A-Monk-Saves-Threatened/49283/ "A Monk Saves Threatened Manuscripts Using Ultramodern Means"], ''The Chronicle'', November 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Benedictine monks of [[Saint John's Abbey, Collegeville|Saint John's Abbey]] founded HMML in 1965 as a response to the loss of manuscripts and books in European libraries during two World Wars. Their plan was to create a [[microfilm]] collection of monastic manuscripts in Minnesota for safekeeping in the event that there would be another European war. Their work soon grew to include the microfilming of other manuscript collections throughout Europe and Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imls.gov/news/2011_medals_hill_museum_manuscript_library.aspx/ "Hill Museum &amp; Manuscript Library"], ''Institute of Museum &amp; Library Services''.&lt;/ref&gt; HMML expanded its focus in 2003 to include the preservation of manuscripts from other [[Eastern Christian]] traditions. Two factors drove this decision: the importance of Eastern Christian cultures to world history and the unstable conditions found in many of the historic regions of Eastern Christianity. With the launch of this project, HMML began using digital technology to preserve collections. In addition to digitizing Christian manuscripts, HMML has also digitized Islamic manuscripts collections from libraries in Harar, Ethiopia and the Old City of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/religion/july-dec10/sacredtexts_12-31.html/ "Monastery Works to Preserve Ancient Christian Texts"], ''PBS News Hour'', December 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, HMML began working with [http://www.savamadci.net SAVAMA-DCI], a malian N60 founded by Dr. Abdel Kader Haidara, to digitize over 200,000 historic documents and manuscripts that were smuggled out of Timbuktu in 2013 and kept safe from radical Islamist rebels who were destroying works they considered to be in conflict with strict Islamic teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where HMML is working|url=http://www.hmml.org/where-were-working.html|website=HMML|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The copying of these [[Timbuktu Manuscripts]] is the largest project, by volume, of the HMML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Catholic monks in Minnesota are helping to save a trove of Islamic treasures in Mali|url=https://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21683977-catholic-monks-minnesota-are-helping-save-trove-islamic-treasures|accessdate=20 December 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections at HMML==

HMML holds photographic copies of more than 140,000 manuscript books and other handwritten documents from hundreds of partner libraries spread across Europe, Africa, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/grants/endangered-culture/hill-museum-and-manuscript-library/ "Hill Museum &amp; Manuscript Library"], ''Arcadia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Manuscripts photographed before 2003 are in microfilm format (especially collections from western Europe, Mali, Ethiopia and Malta), while later collections have been photographed digitally (Middle East, India, and recent projects in Ethiopia and Europe). HMML also has about 10,000 rare books, as well as medieval and early modern manuscripts from Europe and Africa. The Arca Artium art collection at HMML includes approximately 6,000 works of art—chiefly printed works (woodcuts, engravings, linoleum cuts, lithographs, etc.) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmml.org/our-collections.html "HMML's Collections and Online Exhibits"], ''Hill Museum &amp; Manuscript Library''.&lt;/ref&gt;

HMML provides bibliographic support for the microfilm and digital collections through its online database [http://www.hmml.org/oliver.html ''OLIVER''] and [http://www.hmml.org/vivarium.html ''Vivarium'']. The printed book collections are cataloged in MnPALS and [[WorldCat]]. [http://www.hmml.org/vivarium.html ''Vivarium''] provides access to research collections of related interest that reside at other institutions, including the [http://www.hmml.org/emml.html Ethiopian Manuscript Imaging Project (EMIP)].  To support the use of its research collections, HMML maintains reference collections dedicated to manuscript studies, printing, art, and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmml.org/our-collections.html "HMML's Collections and Online Exhibits"], ''Hill Museum &amp; Manuscript Library''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital and Microfilm Collections===

The manuscript image collections at HMML are centered in four larger groupings, with several smaller collections.
::▪	Materials from Austria, Germany and Switzerland
::▪	Malta Collection: over 16,000 documentary records and manuscripts from the island of Malta and the [[Knights of Malta]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmml.org/malta-study-center.html "The Malta Study Center"], ''Hill Museum &amp; Manuscript Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
::▪	Ethiopian Collection: over 8,000 manuscripts &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmml.org/ethiopia-study-center.html "Ethiopia Study Center"], ''Hill Museum &amp; Manuscript Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
::▪	Recent projects focus on Eastern Christian materials; Syriac, Arabic, and Armenian manuscripts in the Middle East and India &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmml.org/where-were-working.html "HMML's Preservation Work"], ''Hill Museum &amp; Manuscript Library''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book and Manuscript Collections===

Of the roughly 10,000 titles in HMML’s printed books collection, nearly half were printed before 1800, with 65 [[Incunable|incunabula]] and over 800 sixteenth-century imprints. Topics covered include: theology, monasticism, biblical studies, patristics, homiletics, liturgical studies, and modern fine press books. Among these is a large collection of printed Bibles from the fifteenth to twentieth centuries. HMML also receives donated rare books and other gifts. The Special Collections at HMML hold a broad range of manuscripts in Latin, German, Italian, Spanish and French, as well as some in Gə’əz and Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmml.org/special-collections.html "Special Collections at HMML"], ''Hill Museum &amp; Manuscript Library''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==

HMML offers a year-round program of temporary exhibits of both selected manuscripts and rare books drawn from its collections.

==Media==

HMML has been featured in many international news stories in early 2017, including NPR's ''Here and Now'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2017/03/13/columba-stewart-manuscripts|title=This Benedictine Monk Travels The World Helping Preserve Centuries-Old Manuscripts, Cultural Heritage|website=www.wbur.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Atlantic'': "The Monk Who Saved Manuscripts from ISIS,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/02/the-monk-who-saves-manuscripts-from-isis/517611/|title=The Monk Who Saves Manuscripts From ISIS|last=Fagotto|first=Matteo|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;" BBC World Service (story begins at 33:10 mark);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04t8k2y|title=The Fight for West Mosul, Newshour - BBC World Service|website=BBC|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's ''The World Today'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-29/benedictine-monks-race-to-preserve-ancient-islamic-manuscripts/8389910|title=Benedictine monk races to preserve ancient Islamic manuscripts|date=2017-03-29|work=ABC News|access-date=2017-04-25|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican's ''L'Obsservatore Romano'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osservatoreromano.va/it/news/salvare-un-patrimonio-culturale|title=Salvare un patrimonio culturale|website=www.osservatoreromano.va|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; PBS' Religion and Ethics Newsweekly;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/2017/01/27/extended-interview-fr-columba-stewart-osb/34517/|title=Extended Interview Fr.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2315">{{refimprove|date=April 2017}}'''Hospitality law''' is a legal and social practice related to the treatment of a person's guests or those who patronize a place of business. Related to the concept of legal liability, hospitality laws are intended to protect both hosts and guests against injury, whether accidental or intentional.

==Duty to guests==
Hotels and other business operators are expected to "act prudently and use reasonable care"&lt;ref&gt; Barth, Stephen. (2009).  Hospitality Law.  p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure that their premises are (reasonably) free of risk. While not specifically requiring that a business owner ensure his guests are safe, most jurisdictions interpret 'prudent and reasonable' to include foreseeable dangers, such as tripping hazards or unsecured shelving.

In most cases, unless directly disclaimed (for example, with some insurance waivers), hospitality law does not protect a business owner against charges of [[negligence]].

==Use in common law==
[[Common law]] holds innkeepers liable for any loss of guest property when the guest is on the premises of a place of business; in practice, such liability is often overlooked provided that the business owner meets certain conditions (such as having a guest sign a waiver of liability). In most countries, for liability waivers to be enforceable, notification of the waiver must be posted in an accessible, visible location (usually at the front desk or in a common area of the business), and must be printed in clearly legible text.

American hospitality statutes also govern [[bailment]]s. A bailment is the "delivery of an item of property, for some purpose, with the expressed or implied understanding that the person receiving it shall return it in the same or similar condition in which it was received, when the purpose has been completed."&lt;ref&gt; Barth, Stephen.  (2009). Hospitality Law. p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Coat checks, safety deposit boxes, and luggage storage are common examples of bailments for the hospitality industry.

The ''Laws of Innkeepers'' by John E.H. Sherry&lt;ref&gt;Third Edition, Published by Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt; provides an in-depth analysis of the laws affecting places of public accommodation.

== Purpose ==
The overall goal of the intelligent design movement is to overthrow [[materialism]] and [[atheism]]. Its proponents believe that society has suffered "devastating" cultural consequences from adopting materialism and that science is the cause of the decay into materialism because it seeks only natural explanations, and is therefore atheistic. They believe that the [[scientific theory]] of [[evolution]] implies that humans have no spiritual nature, no moral purpose, and no intrinsic meaning. They seek to "reverse the stifling dominance of the [[Materialism|materialist]] [[world view|worldview]]", represented by the theory of evolution, in favor of "a science consonant with [[Christian]] and [[Theism|theistic]] convictions."&lt;ref name="wedge_strategy" /&gt;

To achieve their goal of defeating a materialistic world view, advocates of intelligent design take a two-pronged approach. Alongside the promotion of intelligent design, proponents also seek to "[[Teach the Controversy]]"; discredit evolution by emphasizing perceived flaws in the theory of evolution, or disagreements within the [[scientific community]] and encourage teachers and students to explore non-scientific alternatives to evolution, or to critically analyze evolution and the controversy surrounding the teaching of evolution. But the world's largest general scientific society, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], has stated that "There is no significant controversy within the scientific community about the validity of evolution." and that "Evolution is one of the most robust and widely accepted principles of modern science."&lt;ref name="ttc_aaas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/0219boardstatement.shtml |title=AAAS Denounces Anti-Evolution Laws as Hundreds of K-12 Teachers Convene for 'Front Line' Event |last=Pinholster |first=Ginger |date=February 19, 2006 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |location=Washington, D.C. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421193306/http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/0219boardstatement.shtml |archivedate=2006-04-21 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling in the 2005 [[Dover, Pennsylvania]], trial, ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', where the claims of intelligent design proponents were considered by a [[Federal judiciary of the United States|United States federal court]], stated that "evolution, including common descent and natural selection, is 'overwhelmingly accepted' by the scientific community."&lt;ref name="kitzmillerpg70"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|vol=04|reporter=cv|opinion=2688|date=December 20, 2005}} [[s:Kitzmiller v.

The [[Discovery Institute]] (DI) is a religious [[think tank]] that drives the intelligent design movement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Attie, et al. 2006|Attie, et al. 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Intelligent Design: Creationism's Trojan Horse - A Conversation With Barbara Forrest |date=February 2005 |url=https://www.au.org/church-state/february-2005-church-state/featured/intelligent-design-creationism%E2%80%99s-trojan-horse-a |journal=Church &amp; State |location=Washington, D.C. |type=Unabridged interview |publisher=[[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] |issn=2163-3746 |accessdate=2014-05-29 |quote=Patricia O'Connell Killen, a religion professor at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma whose work centers around the regional religious identity of the Pacific Northwest, recently wrote that 'religiously inspired think tanks such as the conservative evangelical Discovery Institute' are part of the 'religious landscape' of that area.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's [[Center for Science and Culture]] (CSC) counts most of the leading intelligent design advocates among its membership, most notably its program advisor [[Phillip E.

According to critics of the intelligent design movement, the movement's purpose is political rather than scientific or educational. They claim the movement's "activities betray an aggressive, systematic agenda for promoting not only intelligent design creationism, but the religious worldview that undergirds it."&lt;ref name="Forrest_2001" /&gt; Intelligent design is an attempt to recast religious dogma in an effort to reintroduce the teaching of [[Book of Genesis|biblical]] [[creationism]] to [[State school#United States|public school]] science classrooms; the intelligent design movement is an effort to reshape American society into a [[theocracy]], primarily through education. As evidence, critics cite the Discovery Institute's political activities, its wedge strategy and statements made by leading intelligent design proponents. The scientific community's position, as represented by the National Academy of Sciences and the [[National Center for Science Education]] (NCSE), is that intelligent design is not science, but creationist [[pseudoscience]]. [[Richard Dawkins]], a biologist and professor at [[Oxford University]], compares the intelligent design movement's demand to "teach the controversy" with the demand to teach [[flat Earth]]ism; acceptable in terms of history, but not in terms of science. "If you give the idea that there are two schools of thought within science--one that says the earth is round and one that says the earth is flat--you are misleading children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wallis |first=Claudia |date=August 7, 2005 |title=The Evolution Wars |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1090909-3,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |location=New York |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--TIME Magazine, 15 August 2005, page 32--&gt;

== Philosophy ==
At the 1999 "Reclaiming America for Christ Conference" called by Reverend [[D. James Kennedy]] of Coral Ridge Ministries, Phillip E. Johnson gave a speech called "How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won."&lt;ref name="debate_won"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coralridge.org/specialdocs/evolutiondebate.asp |title=How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E |authorlink=Phillip E. Johnson |website=[[D. James Kennedy|Coral Ridge Ministries]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107005414/http://www.coralridge.org/specialdocs/evolutiondebate.asp |publisher=Coral Ridge Ministries |location=Fort Lauderdale, FL |archivedate=2007-11-07 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he sums up the theological and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] underpinnings of intelligent design and its strategy for victory:

{{quotation|To talk of a purposeful or guided evolution is not to talk about evolution at all. That is "slow creation." When you understand it that way, you realize that the Darwinian theory of evolution contradicts not just the book of Genesis, but every word in the Bible from beginning to end. It contradicts the idea that we are here because a Creator brought about our existence for a purpose. That is the first thing I realized, and it carries tremendous meaning.}}
{{quotation|I have built an intellectual movement in the universities and churches that we call "The Wedge," which is devoted to scholarship and writing that furthers this program of questioning the materialistic basis of science. One very famous book that's come out of The Wedge is biochemist Michael Behe's book ''Darwin's Black Box'', which has had an enormous impact on the scientific world.}}
{{quotation|Now, the way that I see the logic of our movement going is like this. The first thing you understand is that the Darwinian theory isn't true. It's falsified by all of the evidence, and the logic is terrible. When you realize that, the next question that occurs to you is, "Well, where might you get truth?" When I preach from the Bible, as I often do at churches and on Sundays, I don't start with Genesis. I start with John 1:1, "In the beginning was the Word." In the beginning was intelligence, purpose, and wisdom. The Bible had that right and the materialist scientists are deluding themselves.|Johnson|How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won&lt;ref name="debate_won"/&gt;}}

== History of the movement ==
The intelligent design movement grew out of a creationist tradition which argues against evolutionary theory from a religious standpoint, usually that of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] or [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalistic Christianity]]. Although intelligent design advocates often claim that they are arguing only for the existence of a designer who may or may not be [[God]], all the movement's leading advocates believe that this designer is God. They frequently accompany their arguments with a discussion of religious issues, especially when addressing religious audiences, but elsewhere downplay the religious aspects of their agenda.

=== Origins ===
The modern use of the words "intelligent design," as a term intended to describe a field of inquiry, began after the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in the case of ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' (1987), ruled that creationism is unconstitutional in public school science curricula. A Discovery Institute report says that [[Charles Thaxton]], editor of ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'', had picked the phrase up from a [[NASA]] scientist, and thought "That's just what I need, it's a good engineering term."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2005/12/post_6001764.html |title=Dover Judge Regurgitates Mythological History of Intelligent Design |last=Witt |first=Jonathan |date=December 20, 2005 |website=Evolution News &amp; Views |publisher=[[Discovery Institute]] |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In drafts of the book over one hundred uses of the root word "creation," such as "creationism" and "creation science," were changed, almost without exception, to "intelligent design,"&lt;ref name="kitz31"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Kitzmiller v.

Johnson, that is regarded as a central text of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stewart 2007|Stewart 2007]], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; ''Darwin on Trial'' mentioned ''Pandas'' as "'creationist' only in the sense that it juxtaposes a paradigm of 'intelligent design' with the dominant paradigm of (naturalistic) evolution," but his use of the term as a focus for his wedge strategy promoting "[[Theistic science#Johnson|theistic realism]]" came later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Johnson 2010|Johnson 2010]], pp. 238–239&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theistic_realism"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |date=May–June 1996 |title=Third-Party Science |url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/bc/1996/mayjun/6b3030.html |journal=[[Christianity Today|Books &amp; Culture]] |type=Book review |volume=2 |issue=3 |accessdate=December 26, 2013}} Article reprinted in full by [[Access Research Network]] [http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/ratzsch.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt; The book was reviewed by evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] for ''[[Scientific American]]'' in July 1992, concluding that the book contains "...no weighing of evidence, no careful reading of literature on all sides, no full citation of sources (the book does not even contain a bibliography) and occasional use of scientific literature only to score rhetorical points."&lt;ref name="gould"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |date=July 1992 |title=Impeaching a Self-Appointed Judge |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/gould_darwin-on-trial.html |journal=[[Scientific American]] |location=Stuttgart, Germany |publisher=[[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group|Holtzbrinck]] |volume=267 |issue=1 |accessdate=2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould's review led to the formation in 1992 or 1993 of an 'Ad Hoc Origins Committee' of Johnson's supporters, which wrote a letter, circulated to thousands of university professors, defending the book. Among the 39 signatories were nine who later became members of the [[Center for Science and Culture|Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture]] (CRSC).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forrest &amp; Gross 2004|Forrest &amp; Gross 2004]], p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ahoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apologetics.org/news/adhoc.html |title=Ad Hoc Origins Committee: ''Scientists Who Question Darwinism'' |website=Christian Apologetics |publisher=[[Trinity College (Florida)|Trinity College]] |location=New Port Richey, FL |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1990s Johnson worked to develop a 'big tent' movement to unify a wide range of creationist viewpoints in opposition to evolution. In 1992, the first formal meeting devoted to intelligent design was held in [[Southern Methodist University]]. It included a debate between Johnson and [[Michael Ruse]] (a key witness in ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' (1982)) and papers by [[William A. Dembski]], [[Michael Behe]] and [[Stephen C. Meyer]]. In 1993, Johnson organized a follow-up meeting, including Dembski, Behe, Meyer, [[Dean H. Kenyon]] (co-author of ''Pandas'') and [[Walter Bradley (engineer)|Walter Bradley]] (co-author with Thaxton and Kenyon of ''The Mystery of Life's Origin'' (1984)), as well as two graduate students, [[Paul Nelson (creationist)|Paul A. Nelson]] and [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Numbers 2006|Numbers 2006]], p. 380&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture ===
{{main|Center for Science and Culture}}
On December 6, 1993, an article by Meyer was published in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', drawing national attention to the controversy over Dean H. Kenyon's teaching of creationism. This article also gained the attention of Discovery Institute co-founder [[Bruce Chapman]]. On discovering that Meyer was developing the idea of starting a scientific research center in conversations with conservative political scientist [[John G. West]], Chapman invited them to create a unit within the Discovery Institute called the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture (later renamed the Center for Science and Culture). This center was dedicated to overthrowing "[[Metaphysical naturalism|scientific materialism]]" and "fomenting nothing less than a scientific and cultural revolution."&lt;ref name="Num381"&gt;[[#Numbers 2006|Numbers 2006]], pp. 381–382&lt;/ref&gt;
A 1995 conference, "The Death of Materialism and the Renewal of Culture," served as a blueprint for the center.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forrest &amp; Gross 2004|Forrest &amp; Gross 2004]], p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; By 1996 they had nearly a million dollars in grants, the largest being from [[Howard Ahmanson, Jr.]], with smaller but still large contributions coming from the Stewardship Foundation established by C. Davis Weyerhaeuser and the Maclellan Foundation, and appointed their first class of research fellows.&lt;ref name="Num381" /&gt;

=== The wedge strategy ===
{{main|Wedge strategy}}
The wedge strategy was formulated by Phillip E. Johnson to combat the "evil" of [[Naturalism (philosophy)#Methodological naturalism|methodological naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Numbers 2006|Numbers 2006]], p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; It first came to the general public's attention when a Discovery Institute internal memo now known as the "[[Wedge strategy|Wedge Document]]" (believed to have been written in 1998) was leaked to the public in 1999. However it is believed to have been update of an earlier document to be implemented between 1996 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forrest &amp; Gross 2004|Forrest &amp; Gross 2004]], pp. 25–29&lt;/ref&gt;

The document begins with "The proposition that human beings are created in the image of God is one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built." and then goes on to outline the movement's goal to exploit perceived discrepancies within evolutionary theory in order to discredit evolution and scientific materialism in general. Much of the strategy is directed toward the broader public, as opposed to the professional scientific community. The stated "governing goals" of the CSC's wedge strategy are:
:1. To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies
:2. To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God

Critics of intelligent design movement argue that the Wedge Document and strategy demonstrate that the intelligent design movement is motivated purely by religion and political ideology and that the Discovery Institute as a matter of policy obfuscates its agenda. The Discovery Institute's official response was to characterize the criticism and concern as "irrelevant," "paranoid," and "near-panic" while portraying the Wedge Document as a "fund-raising document."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/f/349 |title=The 'Wedge Document': 'So What?' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2003 |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson in his 1997 book ''Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds'' confirmed some of the concerns voiced by the movement's gainsayers:
{{quotation|If we understand our own times, we will know that we should affirm the reality of God by challenging the domination of materialism and naturalism in the world of the mind. With the assistance of many friends I have developed a strategy for doing this,...We call our strategy the "wedge."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Johnson 1997|Johnson 1997]], pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Kansas evolution hearings ===
{{main|Kansas evolution hearings}}
The Kansas evolution hearings were a series of hearings held in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Kansas]], from May 5 to May 12, 2005, by the [[Kansas State Department of Education|Kansas State Board of Education]] and its State Board Science Hearing Committee to change how evolution and the [[origin of life]] would be taught in the state's public high school science classes. The hearings were arranged by the conservative Board with the intent of introducing intelligent design into science classes via the "Teach the Controversy" method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/kansas/kangaroo6.html |title=Kansas Evolution Hearings: Part 6 |date=July 1, 2005 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2005/05/13/kansas_5/ |title=A Real Monkey Trial |last=Dizikes |first=Peter |date=May 13, 2005 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Salon Media Group |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hearings raised the issues of [[creation and evolution in public education]] and were attended by all the major participants in the intelligent design movement but were ultimately boycotted by the scientific community over concern of lending credibility to the claim, made by proponents of intelligent design, that evolution is purportedly the subject of wide dispute within the scientific and science education communities.

The Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement, played a central role in starting the hearings by promoting its [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|Critical Analysis of Evolution]] lesson plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/a/2112 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Key Resources for Parents and School Board Members |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the Kansas State Board of Education eventually adopted over objections of the State Board Science Hearing Committee, and campaigning on behalf of conservative Republican candidates for the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 7, 2006 |title=Some question group's move with elections nearing |url=http://www.6newslawrence.com/news/2006/jul/07/many_question_groups_move_elections_nearing/ |work=[[6 News Lawrence|6News Lawrence]] |format=QuickTime |location=Lawrence, KS |publisher=[[Lawrence Journal-World]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503093917/http://www.6newslawrence.com/news/2006/jul/07/many_question_groups_move_elections_nearing/ |archivedate=2007-05-03 |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local science advocacy group [[Kansas Citizens for Science]] organized a [[boycott]] of the hearings by mainstream scientists, who accused it of being a [[kangaroo court]] and argued that their participation would lend an undeserved air of legitimacy to the hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Scholfield |first=Randy |date=March 30, 2005 |title=Scientists right to boycott evolution hearings |url=http://www.kansas.com/mld/eagle/news/editorial/11260641.htm |newspaper=[[The Wichita Eagle]] |type=Editorial |location=San Jose, CA |publisher=[[Knight Ridder]] |page=A6 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405050648/http://www.kansas.com/mld/eagle/news/editorial/11260641.htm |archivedate=2005-04-05 |accessdate=2014-05-30}}

ID (Intelligent Design) is science-based and strong in facts." At their conclusion she proclaimed that evolution is "an unproven, often disproven" theory.&lt;ref name="Bailey_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bailey |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Bailey |date=May 25, 2005 |title=Unintelligent Design |url=http://reason.com/archives/2005/05/25/unintelligent-design |journal=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=[[Reason Foundation]] |issn=0048-6906 |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"ID has theological implications. ID is not strictly Christian, but it is theistic," asserted Martin.&lt;ref name="Bailey_2005" /&gt; The scientific community rejects teaching intelligent design as science; a leading example being the National Academy of Sciences, which issued a policy statement saying "Creationism, intelligent design, and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life or of species are not science because they are not testable by the [[Scientific method|methods of science]]."&lt;ref name="nas_25" /&gt;

On February 13, 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005.&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hanna |first=John |date=February 13, 2007 |title=Evolution of Kansas science standards continues as Darwin's theories regain prominence |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/13/america/NA-GEN-US-Kansas-Evolution-History.php |newspaper=[[International New York Times|International Herald Tribune]] |location=New York |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525044215/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/13/america/NA-GEN-US-Kansas-Evolution-History.php |archivedate=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An August 2005 poll from The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life showed 64% of Americans favoring the teaching of creationism along with evolution in science classrooms, though only 38% favored teaching it instead of evolution, with the results varying deeply by education level and religiosity. The poll showed the educated were far less attached to intelligent design than the less educated. Evangelicals and fundamentalists showed high rates of affiliation with intelligent design while other religious persons and the secular were much lower.&lt;ref name="Public Divided on Origins of Life"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2005/08/30/public-divided-on-origins-of-life/ |title=Public Divided on Origins of Life |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=August 30, 2005 |website=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists responding to a poll overwhelmingly said intelligent design is about religion, not science. A 2002 sampling of 460 Ohio science professors had 91% say it's primarily religion, 93% say there is not "any scientifically valid evidence or an alternate scientific theory that challenges the fundamental principles of the theory of evolution," and 97% say that they did not use intelligent design concepts in their own research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uc.edu/news/idpoll.htm |title=Majority of Ohio Science Professors and Public Agree: 'Intelligent Design' Mostly About Religion |last=Hoffman |first=Carey |date=October 11, 2002 |website=University of Cincinnati |publisher=[[University of Cincinnati]] |location=Cincinnati, OH |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October and November 2001, the Discovery Institute advertised ''[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]]'' in three national publications (''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''[[The Weekly Standard]]''), listing what they claimed were "100 scientific dissenters" who had signed a statement that "We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life.

The list was further criticized in a February 2006 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' which pointed out that only 25% of the signatories by then were biologists and that signatories' "doubts about evolution grew out of their religious beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=February 21, 2006 |title=Few Biologists But Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/science/sciencespecial2/21peti.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, as a humorous parody of such listings the NCSE produced the pro-evolution [[Project Steve]] list of signatories, all with variations of the name Steve and most of whom are trained biologists.

== Structure ==

=== The 'big tent' strategy ===
The movement's strategy as set forth by Phillip E. Johnson states the replacement of "materialist science" with "theistic science" as its primary goal; and, more generally, for intelligent design to become "the dominant perspective in science" and to "permeate our religious, cultural, moral and political life." This agenda is now being actively pursued by the Center for Science and Culture, which plays the leading role in the promotion of intelligent design. Its fellows include most of the leading intelligent design advocates: William A. Dembski, Michael Behe, Jonathan Wells and Stephen C. Meyer.

Intelligent design has been described by its proponents as a 'big tent' belief, one in which all theists united by having some kind of creationist belief (but of differing opinions as regards details) can support. If successfully promoted, it would reinstate creationism in the teaching of science, after which debates regarding details could resume. In his 2002 article in ''Christian Research Journal'', Discovery Institute fellow Paul A. Nelson credits Johnson for the 'big tent' approach and for reviving creationist debate since the ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nelson |first=Paul A. |authorlink=Paul Nelson (creationist) |year=2002 |title=Life In The Big Tent: Traditional Creationism And The Intelligent Design Community |url=http://www.equip.org/PDF/DL303.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Christian Research Journal |location=Charlotte, NC |publisher=[[Christian Research Institute]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |issn=1082-572X |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nelson, "The promise of the big tent of ID is to provide a setting where Christians (and others) may disagree amicably, and fruitfully, about how best to understand the natural world, as well as Scripture."

In his presentation to the 1999 "Reclaiming America for Christ Conference," "How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won," Johnson affirmed this 'big tent' role for "The Wedge" (without using the term intelligent design):

{{quotation|To talk of a purposeful or guided evolution is not to talk about evolution at all. That is "slow creation." When you understand it that way, you realize that the Darwinian theory of evolution contradicts not just the book of Genesis, but every word in the Bible from beginning to end. It contradicts the idea that we are here because a Creator brought about our existence for a purpose. That is the first thing I realized, and it carries tremendous meaning.

[...]

So did God create us? Or did we create God? That's an issue that unites people across the theistic world. Even religious, God-believing Jewish people will say, "That's an issue we really have a stake in, so let's debate that question first. Let us settle that question first. There are plenty of other important questions on which we may not agree, and we'll have a wonderful time discussing those questions after we've settled the first one. We will approach those questions in a better spirit because we have worked together for this important common end."

[...]

[The Wedge is] inherently an ecumenical movement. Michael Behe is a Roman Catholic. The next book that is coming out from Cambridge University Press by one of my close associates is by an evangelical convert to Greek Orthodoxy. We have a lot of Protestants, too. The point is that we have this broad-based intellectual movement that is enabling us to get a foothold in the scientific and academic journals and in the journals of the various religious faiths.|Johnson|How The Evolution Debate Can Be Won&lt;ref name="debate_won"/&gt;}}

The Discovery Institute consistently denies allegations that its intelligent design agenda has religious foundations, and downplays the religious source of much of its funding. In an interview of Stephen C. Meyer when ''[[ABC World News|World News Tonight]]'' asked about the Discovery Institute's many evangelical Christian donors the Institute's public relations representative stopped the interview saying "I don't think we want to go down that path."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 9, 2005 |title=Small Group Wields Major Influence in Intelligent Design Debate |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=1297170&amp;WNT=true |work=[[ABC World News|World News Tonight]] |location=New York |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obfuscation of religious motivation ===
Phillip E. Johnson, largely regarded as the leader of the movement, positions himself as a "theistic realist" against "methodological naturalism" and intelligent design as the method through which God created [[life]].&lt;ref name="johnson_theistic_realist"&gt;[[#Johnson 1995|Johnson 1995]], pp. 208-209. "A theistic realist assumes that the universe and all its creatures were brought into existence for a purpose by God. Theistic realists expect this 'fact' of creation to have empirical, observable consequences that are different from the consequences one would observe if the universe were the product of nonrational causes... God always has the option of working through regular secondary mechanisms, and we observe such mechanisms frequently. On the other hand, many important questions—including the origin of genetic information and human consciousness—may not be explicable in terms of unintelligent causes, just as a computer or a book cannot be explained that way."&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson explicitly calls for intelligent design proponents to obfuscate their religious motivations so as to avoid having intelligent design recognized "as just another way of packaging the [[Evangelicalism|Christian evangelical message]]."&lt;ref name="johnson_evangelical_message"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |date=April 1999 |title=Keeping the Darwinists Honest |url=http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/citmag99.htm |journal=Citizen |location=Colorado Springs, CO |publisher=[[Focus on the Family]] |issn=1084-6832 |accessdate=2014-06-01 |quote="ID is an intellectual movement, and the Wedge strategy stops working when we are seen as just another way of packaging the Christian evangelical message. [...] The evangelists do what they do very well, and I hope our work opens up for them some doors that have been closed."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence intelligent design arguments are carefully formulated in [[secular]] terms and intentionally avoid positing the identity of the designer. Johnson has stated that cultivating ambiguity by employing secular language in arguments which are carefully crafted to avoid overtones of [[theism|theistic]] [[creationism]] is a necessary first step for ultimately introducing the Christian concept of God as the designer. Johnson emphasizes "the first thing that has to be done is to get the [[Bible]] out of the discussion" and that "after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact" only then can "biblical issues" be discussed.&lt;ref name="johnson_bible_out"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |date=July–August 1999 |title=The Wedge: Breaking the Modernist Monopoly on Science |url=http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=12-04-018-f |journal=[[Touchstone Magazine|Touchstone: A Journal of Mere Christianity]] |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=Fellowship of St. James |volume=12 |issue=4 |issn=0897-327X |accessdate=2014-06-01 |quote="...the first thing that has to be done is to get the Bible out of the discussion. ...This is not to say that the biblical issues are unimportant; the point is rather that the time to address them will be after we have separated materialist prejudice from scientific fact."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreword to ''Creation, Evolution, &amp; Modern Science'' (2000) Johnson writes "The intelligent design movement starts with the recognition that 'In the beginning was the Word,' and 'In the beginning God created.' Establishing that point isn't enough, but it is absolutely essential to the rest of the gospel message."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bohlin 2000|Bohlin 2000]], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Center for Science and Culture ====
{{Main|Center for Science and Culture}}
The Center for Science and Culture, formerly known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture, is a division of the Discovery Institute. The Center consists of a tightly knit core of people who have worked together for almost a decade to advance intelligent design as both a concept and a movement as necessary adjuncts of its wedge strategy policy. This cadre includes Phillip E. Johnson, Michael Behe, William A. Dembski and Stephen C. Meyer. They are united by a religious vision which, although it varies among the members in its particulars and is seldom acknowledged outside of the Christian press, is predicated on the shared conviction that America is in need of "renewal" which can be accomplished only by unseating "Godless" materialism and instituting religion as its cultural foundation.

In his keynote address at the "Research and Progress in intelligent design" (RAPID) conference held in 2002 at [[Biola University]], William A. Dembski described intelligent design's "dual role as a constructive scientific project and as a means for cultural renaissance." In a similar vein, the movement's hub, the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture had until 2002 been the "''Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture''." Explaining the name change, a spokesperson for the CSC insisted that the old name was simply too long. However, the change followed accusations that the center's real interest was not science but reforming culture along lines favored by conservative Christians.

Critics of the movement cite the Wedge Document as confirmation of this criticism and assert that the movement's leaders, particularly Phillip E. Johnson, view the subject as a [[culture war]]: "Darwinian evolution is not primarily important as a scientific theory but as a culturally dominant creation story. ... When there is radical disagreement in a commonwealth about the creation story, the stage is set for intense conflict, the kind of conflict that is known as a 'culture war.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Johnson 1995|Johnson 1995]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cpq97VuAAJEC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 12–13]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the Center for Science and Culture's has moderated its previous overtly theistic mission statements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/crsc/aboutcrsc.html |title=What is The Center for the Renewal of Science &amp; Culture All About? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=[[Center for Science and Culture|Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture]] |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970608130849/http://www.discovery.org/crsc/aboutcrsc.html |archivedate=1997-06-08 |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; to appeal to a broader, a more secular audience. It hopes to accomplish this by using less overtly theistic messages and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/csc/aboutCSC.php |title=CSC - About CSC |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the Center for Science and Culture still states as a goal a redefinition of science, and the philosophy on which it is based, particularly the exclusion of what it calls the "unscientific principle of materialism," and in particular the acceptance of what it calls "the scientific theory of intelligent design."

Promotional materials from the Discovery Institute acknowledge that the [[Howard Ahmanson, Jr.|Ahmanson]] family donated $1.5 million to the Center for Science and Culture, then known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture, for a research and publicity program to "unseat not just Darwinism but also Darwinism's cultural legacy."&lt;ref name="Reason_Olson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olson |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Olson |date=January 1999 |title=Dark Bedfellows: Postmoderns and Traditionalists Unite Against the Enlightenment |url=http://dheise.andrews.edu/Content/leadership/comps/6a/1educ_fndns/freed_readings/educ632_2.6.htm |journal=Reason |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=Reason Foundation |issn=0048-6906 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Ahmanson funds many causes important to the [[Christian right|Christian religious right]], including [[Christian Reconstructionism]], whose goal is to place the [[United States|US]] "under the control of biblical law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2004/01/06/ahmanson/ |title=Avenging angel of the religious right |last=Blumenthal |first=Max |authorlink=Max Blumenthal |date=January 6, 2004 |website=Salon |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Salon Media Group |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1995, Ahmanson sat on the board of the Christian Reconstructionist [[Chalcedon Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clarkson |first=Frederick |authorlink=Frederick Clarkson |date=March–June 1994 |title=Christian Reconstructionism: Part 3: No Longer Without Sheep |url=http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v08n1/chrisre3.html |journal=[[Public Eye Magazine|The Public Eye]] |location=Somerville, MA |publisher=[[Political Research Associates]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |issn=0275-9322 |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
The intelligent design movement primarily campaigns on two fronts: a public relations campaign meant to influence the popular [[Mass media|media]] and sway [[opinion of the public|public opinion]]; and an aggressive lobbying campaign to cultivate support for the teaching of intelligent design amongst policymakers and the wider educational community. Both these activities are largely funded and directed by the Discovery Institute, from national to [[grassroots]] levels. The movement's first goal is to establish an acceptance of intelligent design at the expense of [[Creation and evolution in public education|evolution in public school science]]; its long-term goal is no less than the "renewal" of American culture through the shaping of public policy to reflect conservative Christian values. As the Discovery Institute states, intelligent design is central to this agenda: "Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions."

The Discovery Institute has also relied on several polls to indicate the acceptance of intelligent design. A 2005 [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris poll]] identified ten percent of adults in the United States as taking what they called the intelligent design position, that "human beings are so complex that they required a powerful force or intelligent being to help create them." (64% agreed with the creationist view that "human beings were created directly by God" and 22% believed that "human beings evolved from earlier species." 49% accepted plant and animal evolution, while 45% did not.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=581 |title=Nearly Two-thirds of U.S. Adults Believe Human Beings Were Created by God |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 6, 2005 |website=The Harris Poll |publisher=[[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] |location=Rochester, NY |id=#52 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217080148/http://harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=581 |archivedate=2005-12-17 |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some polls commissioned by the Discovery Institute show more support, these polls have been criticized as suffering from considerable flaws, such as having a low response rate (248 out of 16,000), being conducted on behalf of an organization with an expressed interest in the outcome of the poll, and containing leading questions.&lt;ref name="Polling_for_ID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/doubtandabout/polling/ |title=Polling for ID |last=Mooney |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Mooney (journalist) |date=September 11, 2003 |website=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |location=Amherst, NY |type=Blog |publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203135805/http://www.csicop.org/doubtandabout/polling/ |archivedate=2007-02-03 |accessdate=2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of intelligent design and its movement contend that intelligent design is a specific form of creationism, [[neo-creationism]], a viewpoint rejected by intelligent design advocates. It was bolstered by the 2005 ruling in United States federal court that a public school district requirement for science classes to teach that intelligent design is an alternative to evolution was a violation of the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', [[United States district court|United States District Judge]] [[John E. Jones III]] [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion|also ruled]] that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature.

In pursuing the goal of establishing intelligent design at the expense of evolution in public school science, intelligent design groups have threatened and isolated high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Testimony, Aralene Callahan"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|vol=04|reporter=cv|opinion=2688|date=December 20, 2005}} [http://www.aclupa.org/files/8813/1404/6696/Day2PMSession.pdf Testimony, Aralene Callahan], September 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Testimony, Julie Smith"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Kitzmiller v.

The campaigns run by intelligent design groups place teachers in the difficult position of arguing against their employers while the legal challenges to local school districts are costly and divert scarce funds away from education into court battles. Although these court battles have almost invariably resulted in the defeat of intelligent design proponents, they are draining and divisive to local schools. For example, as a result of ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'' trial, the Dover Area School District was forced to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages for pursuing a policy of ''teaching the controversy'' - presenting intelligent design as an allegedly scientific alternative to evolution.

=== Campaigns ===
{{Main|Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns}}
The Discovery Institute, through its Center for Science and Culture, has formulated a number of campaigns to promote intelligent design, while discrediting [[evolutionary biology]], which the Institute terms "[[Darwinism]]."&lt;ref name="ForrestMay2007Paper" /&gt;

Prominent Institute campaigns have been to "Teach the Controversy" and, more recently, to allow Critical Analysis of Evolution. Other prominent campaigns have claimed that intelligent design advocates (most notably [[Richard Sternberg]]) have been discriminated against, and thus that [[Academic Freedom bills]] are needed to protect academics' and teachers' ability to criticise evolution, and that there is a link from evolution to ideologies such as [[Nazism]] and [[eugenics]]. These three claims are all publicised in the pro-ID movie ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'' (2008). Other campaigns have included petitions, most notably ''A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism''.

The response of the scientific community has been to reiterate that the theory of evolution is overwhelmingly accepted as a matter of [[scientific consensus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delgado |first=Cynthia |date=July 28, 2006 |title=Finding the Evolution in Medicine |url=http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |journal=[[NIH Record]] |location=Bethesda, MD |publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]; [[National Institutes of Health]] |issn=1057-5871 |accessdate=2014-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122022815/http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |archivedate=November 22, 2008 |df= }} "...While 99.9 percent of scientists accept evolution, 40 to 50 percent of college students do not accept evolution and believe it to be 'just' a theory." — [[Brian Alters]]&lt;/ref&gt;  whereas intelligent design has been rejected by the overwhelming majority of the scientific community (see [[list of scientific societies explicitly rejecting intelligent design]]).

=== Politics and public education ===
{{main|Intelligent design in politics|creation and evolution in public education}}
The main battlefield for this culture war has been US regional and state [[Board of education|school boards]]. [[Court]]s have also become involved as those campaigns to include intelligent design or weaken the teaching of evolution in public school science curricula are challenged on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boyle |first1=Tara |last2=Farden |first2=Vicki |last3=Godoy |first3=Maria |date=December 20, 2005 |title=Teaching Evolution: A State-by-State Debate |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4630737 |work=[[NPR]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Public Radio, Inc. |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', the plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy thus violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

Intelligent design is an integral part of a political campaign by cultural conservatives, largely from evangelical religious convictions, that seek to redefine science to suit their own ideological agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cstl-cla.semo.edu/rdrenka/Renka_papers/intell_design.htm |title=The Political Design of Intelligent Design |last=Renka |first=Russell D. |date=November 16, 2005 |website=Renka's Home Page |location=Round Rock, TX |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though numerically a minority of Americans,.&lt;ref name="Public Divided on Origins of Life" /&gt; the politics of intelligent design is based less on numbers than on intensive mobilization of ideologically committed followers and savvy public relations campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Slevin |first=Peter |date=March 14, 2005 |title=Battle on Teaching Evolution Sharpens |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32444-2005Mar13.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |location=Washington, D.C. |page=A01 |accessdate=2014-06-03 |quote=In Seattle, the nonprofit Discovery Institute spends more than $1 million a year for research, polls and media pieces supporting intelligent design.}}
* [[#Wilgoren 2005|Wilgoren 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Political repercussions from the culturally conservative sponsorship of the issue has been divisive and costly to the effected communities, polarizing and dividing not only those directly charged with educating young people but entire local communities.

With a doctrine that calls itself science among non-scientists but is rejected by the vast majority of the real practitioners, an amicable coexistence and collaboration between intelligent design advocates and upholders of mainstream  science education standards is rare. With mainstream scientific and educational organizations saying the theory of evolution is not "in crisis" or a subject doubted by scientists, nor intelligent design the emergent scientific paradigm or rival theory its proponents proclaim,&lt;ref name="top_issues"&gt;{{cite press release |last1=Schmid |first1=Julie |last2=Knight |first2=Jonathan |date=June 17, 2005 |title=Faculty Association Speaks Out on Three Top Issues |url=http://www.aaup.org/newsroom/press/2005/amres.htm |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[American Association of University Professors]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210021246/http://www.aaup.org/newsroom/press/2005/amres.htm |archivedate=2006-02-10 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; "teaching the controversy" is suitable for classes on politics, history, culture, or theology they say, but not science. By attempting to force the issue into science classrooms, intelligent design proponents create a charged environment that forces participants and bystanders alike to declare their positions, which has resulted in intelligent design groups threatening and isolating high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Testimony, Aralene Callahan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Testimony, Julie Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Kitzmiller v.

Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#Page 130 of 139|6:Curriculum, Conclusion, pp. 129–130]]. "Moreover, Board members and teachers opposing the curriculum change and its implementation have been confronted directly. First, Casey Brown testified that following her opposition to the curriculum change on October 18, 2004, Buckingham called her an atheist and Bonsell told her that she would go to hell. Second, Angie Yingling was coerced into voting for the curriculum change by Board members accusing her of being an atheist and un- Christian. In addition, both Bryan Rehm and Fred Callahan have been confronted in similarly hostile ways, as have teachers in the DASD."&lt;/ref&gt;

In a round table discussion entitled "Science Wars: Should Schools Teach Intelligent Design?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/events/2005/10/21/science-wars-event/ |title=Science Wars: Should Schools Teach Intelligent Design? |date=October 21, 2005 |publisher=[[American Enterprise Institute]] |location=Washington, D.C. |type=Conference |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] on 21 October 2005 and televised on [[C-SPAN]], the Discovery Institute's Mark Ryland and the Thomas More Law Center's Richard Thompson had a frank disagreement, in which Ryland claimed the Discovery Institute has always cautioned against the teaching of intelligent design, and Thompson responded that the Institute's leadership had not only advocated the teaching of intelligent design, but encouraged others to do so, and that the Dover Area School District had merely followed the Institute's calls for action.&lt;ref name="InstituteandThomasSquabble"/&gt; As evidence, Thompson cited the Discovery Institute's guidebook ''Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curricula'' written by the Institute's co-founder and first director, Stephen C. Meyer, and David K. DeWolf, a CSC Fellow, which stated in its closing paragraphs: "Moreover, as the previous discussion demonstrates, school boards have the authority to permit, and even encourage, teaching about design theory as an alternative to Darwinian evolution -- and this includes the use of textbooks such as ''Of Pandas and People'' that present evidence for the theory of intelligent design."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeWolf, Meyer, &amp; DeForrest 1999|DeWolf, Meyer, &amp; DeForrest 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher education ===
In 1999, William A. Dembski was invited by [[Baylor University]] president [[Robert B. Sloan]] to form the [[Michael Polanyi Center]], described by Dembski as "the first Intelligent Design think tank at a research university." Its creation was controversial with Baylor faculty, and in 2000 it was merged with the Institute for Faith and Learning. Dembski, although remaining as a research professor until 2005, was given no courses to teach.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Phy-Olsen 2010|Phy-Olsen 2010]], pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Two universities have offered courses in intelligent design: [[Oklahoma Baptist University]], where ID advocate Michael Newton Keas taught 'Unified Studies: Introduction to Biology,' and [[Biola University]], host of the [[Mere Creation]] conference.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forrest &amp; Gross 2004|Forrest &amp; Gross 2004]], p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, numerous Christian evangelical institutions have faculty with interests in intelligent design. These include [[Oral Roberts University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webapps.oru.edu/new_php/academics/faculty_profile.php?id=61 |title=Dr. William Collier |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Oral Roberts University |location=Tulsa, OK |publisher=[[Oral Roberts University]] |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swbts.edu/academics/faculty/college/michael-n-keas/ |title=Michael N.

In 2005, the [[American Association of University Professors]] issued a strongly worded statement asserting that the theory of evolution is nearly universally accepted in the community of scholars, and deploring requirements "to make students aware of an 'intelligent-design hypothesis' to account for the origins of life." It said that such requirements are "inimical to principles of academic freedom."&lt;ref name="top_issues" /&gt;

=== The Web ===

Much of the actual debate over intelligent design between intelligent design proponents and members of the scientific community has taken place on the [[World Wide Web|Web]], primarily blogs and message boards, instead of the scientific journals and symposia where traditionally much science is discussed and settled. In promoting intelligent design the actions of its proponents have been more like a political pressure group than like researchers entering an academic debate as described by movement critic [[Taner Edis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Young &amp; Edis 2004|Young &amp; Edis 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; The movement lacks any verifiable scientific research program and concomitant debates in academic circles.&lt;ref name="Forrest_2001" /&gt;

The Web continues to play a central role in the Discovery Institute's strategy of promotion of intelligent design and it adjunct campaigns. On September 6, 2006, on the Center's ''Evolution News &amp; Views'' blog, Discovery Institute staffer Casey Luskin published a post entitled "Putting Wikipedia On Notice About Their Biased Anti-ID Intelligent Design Entries." In the post, Luskin reprinted a letter from a reader complaining that Wikipedia's coverage of ID to be "one sided" and that pro-intelligent design editors were censored and attacked. Along with the letter, Luskin published a Wikipedia email address for general information and urged readers "to contact Wikipedia to express your feelings about the biased nature of the entries on intelligent design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/09/wikipedia_youre_on_notice002574.html |title=Putting Wikipedia On Notice About Their Biased Anti-ID Intelligent Design Entries |last=Luskin |first=Casey |date=September 6, 2006 |website=Evolution News &amp; Views |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International ===
Despite being primarily based in the United States, there have been efforts to introduce pro-intelligent design teaching material into educational facilities in other countries. In the [[United Kingdom]], the group [[Truth in Science]] has used material from the Discovery Institute to create free teaching packs which have been mass-mailed to all UK schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Randerson |first=James |date=November 26, 2006 |title=Revealed: rise of creationism in UK schools |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/nov/27/controversiesinscience.religion |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this emerged, government ministers announced that they regarded intelligent design to be creationism and unsuitable for teaching in the classroom. They also announced that the teaching of the material in science classes was to be prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Randerson |first=James |date=December 6, 2006 |title=Ministers to ban creationist teaching aids in science lessons |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/07/schools.religion |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms of the movement ==
One of the most common criticisms of the movement and its leadership is that of [[intellectual dishonesty]], in the form of misleading impressions created by the use of rhetoric, intentional [[ambiguity]], and misrepresented evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenhouse |first=Jason |authorlink=Jason Rosenhouse |date=January 2003 |title=Leaders and Followers in the Intelligent-Design Movement |url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/1/6.full |journal=[[BioScience]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] on behalf of the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=6–7 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[0006:LAFITI]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0006-3568 |accessdate=2014-05-19 |quote=ID supporters present fallacious arguments, use dishonest rhetoric, and often present non-contemptuous responses as evidence that their theories are gaining acceptance.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is alleged that its goal is to lead an unwary public to reach certain conclusions, and that many have been deceived as a result. Critics of the movement, such as [[Eugenie Scott]], [[Robert T. Pennock]] and [[Barbara Forrest]], claim that leaders of the intelligent design movement, and the Discovery Institute in particular, knowingly misquote scientists and other experts, deceptively omit contextual text through [[ellipsis]], and make unsupported amplifications of relationships and credentials. Theologian and molecular biophysicist [[Alister McGrath]] has a number of criticisms of the Intelligent design movement, stating that "those who adopt this approach make Christianity deeply... vulnerable to scientific progress" and defining it as just another "[[God of the gaps|god-of-the-gaps]]" theory. He went on to criticize the movement on theological grounds as well, stating "It is not an approach I accept, either on scientific or theological grounds."&lt;ref&gt;[[#McGrath &amp; McGrath 2007|McGrath &amp; McGrath 2007]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Such statements commonly note the institutional affiliations of signatories for purposes of identification. But this statement strategically listed either the institution that granted a signatory's [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] or the institutions with which the individual is presently affiliated. Thus the institutions listed for Raymond G. Bohlin, Fazale Rana, and Jonathan Wells, for example, were the [[University of Texas at Dallas|University of Texas]], [[Ohio University]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], respectively, where they earned their degrees, rather than their current affiliations: ''Probe Ministries'' for Bohlin, ''[[Reasons To Believe|Reasons to Believe]]'' ministry for Rana, and the Discovery Institute's ''Center for Science and Culture'' for Wells. Similarly confusing lists of local scientists were circulated during controversies over evolution education in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[New Mexico]], [[Ohio]], and [[Texas]]. In another instance, the Discovery Institute frequently mentions the [[Nobel Prize]] in connection with [[Henry F. Schaefer, III]], a CSC Fellow, and chemist at the [[University of Georgia]]. Critics allege that Discovery Institute is inflating his reputation by constantly referring to him as a "five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize" because Nobel Prize nominations remain confidential for fifty years.

This criticism is not reserved only to the Institute; individual intelligent design proponents have been accused of using their own credentials and those of others in a misleading or confusing fashion. For example, critics allege William A. Dembski gratuitously invokes his laurels by boasting of his correspondence with a [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]], bragging that one of his books was published in a series whose editors include a Nobel laureate, and exulting that the publisher of the intelligent design book ''The Mystery of Life's Origin'', [[Philosophical Library]], also published books by eight Nobel laureates. Critics claim that Dembski purposefully omits relevant facts which he fails to mention to his audience that in 1986, during the ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' hearings, 72 Nobel laureates endorsed an ''amicus curiae'' brief that noted that the "evolutionary history of organisms has been as extensively tested and as thoroughly corroborated as any biological concept."&lt;ref name="Edwards_v_Aguillard_amicus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/amicus1.html |title=Edwards v. Aguillard: U.S. Supreme Court Decision |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common criticism is that since no intelligent design research has been published in mainstream, [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]]s, the Discovery Institute often misuses the work of mainstream scientists by putting out lists of articles that allegedly support their arguments for intelligent design drawing from mainstream scientific literature. Often, the original authors respond that their articles cited by the center don't support their arguments at all. Many times, the original authors have publicly refuted them for distorting the meaning of something they've written for their own purposes.

[[Sahotra Sarkar]], a [[Molecular biology|molecular biologist]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]], has testified that intelligent design advocates, and specifically the Discovery Institute, have misused his work by misrepresenting its conclusions to bolster their own claims, has gone on to allege that the extent of the misrepresentations rises to the level of professional [[malfeasance]]:

{{quotation|"When testifying before the Texas State Board of Education in 2003 (in a battle over textbook adoption that we won hands down), I claimed that my work had been maliciously misused by members of the Discovery Institute. ... The trouble is that it says nothing of the sort that Meyer claims. I don't mention Dembski, ID, or "intelligent" information whatever that may be. I don't talk about assembly instructions. In fact what the paper essentially does is question the value of informational notions altogether, which made many molecular biologists unhappy, but which is also diametrically opposed to the "complex specified information" project of the ID creationists. ... Notice how my work is being presented as being in concordance with ID when Meyer knows very well where I stand on this issue. If Meyer were an academic, this kind of malfeasance would rightly earn him professional censure. Unfortunlately he's not. He's only the Director of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture."|Sahotra Sarkar|Fraud from the Discovery Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webapp.utexas.edu/blogs/archives/sarkarlab/003383.html |title=Fraud from the Discovery Institute |last=Sarkar |first=Sahotra |authorlink=Sahotra Sarkar |date=December 3, 2005 |website=Sarkar Lab WebLog |type=Blog |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806005117/http://webapp.utexas.edu/blogs/archives/sarkarlab/003383.html |archivedate=2006-08-06 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An October 2005 conference called "When Christians and Cultures Clash" was held in Christ Hall at [[Evangelical Seminary|Evangelical School of Theology]] in [[Myerstown, Pennsylvania]]. Attorney Randall L. Wenger, who is affiliated with the Alliance Defense Fund, and a close ally of the Discovery Institute, and one of the presenters at the conference advocated the use of subterfuge for advancing the movement's religious goals: "But even with God's blessing, it's helpful to consult a lawyer before joining the battle... For instance, the Dover area school board might have had a better case for the intelligent design disclaimer they inserted into high school biology classes had they not mentioned a religious motivation at their meetings... Give us a call before you do something controversial like that... I think we need to do a better job at being clever as serpents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burke |first=Daniel |date=October 20, 2005 |title="Bring us your legal issues," clergy told |url=http://lancasteronline.com/news/bring-us-your-legal-issues-clergy-told/article_8db31e2c-b983-5fc6-a642-6060f0964230.html?mode=jqm |newspaper=[[Lancaster Newspapers, Inc.|Lancaster New Era]] |location=Lancaster, PA |accessdate=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''IDEC 2009:'' The conference was cancelled due to [[2009 flu pandemic|H1N1]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://2009.e-idec.org/en/node/126 Notice | IDEC 2009 KOREA] official website. Retrieved 9/10/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''keynote''' in [[public speaking]] is a talk that establishes a main underlying theme. In corporate or commercial settings, greater importance is attached to the delivery of a keynote speech or keynote address. The keynote establishes the framework for the following programme of events or convention agenda; frequently the role of keynote speaker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikehourigan.com/keynote-speaker-really/ |title=What is a Keynote Speaker, really? |publisher=Mike Hourigan |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; will include that of convention moderator. It will also flag up a larger idea – a literary story, an individual musical piece, or event.

At political or industrial conventions and expositions and at [[academic conference]]s, the '''keynote address''' or '''keynote speech''' is delivered to set the underlying tone and summarize the core message or most important revelation of the event. Some of the more famous keynote speeches in the [[United States]] are those made at the [[United States presidential nominating convention|party conventions]] during [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|presidential]] campaigns. Keynote speakers at these events have often gained nationwide fame (or notoriety); for example, [[Barack Obama]] at the [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address|2004 Democratic National Convention]], and have occasionally influenced the course of the election. In the commercial arena, [[Steve Jobs]] delivered  influential keynote speeches at [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] product, system and service launches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2012/10/04/11-presentation-lessons-you-can-still-learn-from-steve-jobs/ |title=11 Presentation Lessons You Can Still Learn From Steve Jobs |publisher=Forbes |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynote speeches are also given at the [[graduation|graduation and commencement ceremonies]] of [[college]]s, [[university|universities]], and major [[secondary school|high schools]], usually by accomplished academics or celebrities invited by the student body.

Keynote speakers are often selected to raise interest in a particular event, such as a conference or large meeting sponsored by a corporation or association, and draw attendees to attend that program. Selecting a keynote speaker who is well known for his or her expertise in a particular field, or who has wide name recognition due to other accomplishments, will probably raise enthusiasm among prospective attendees for a meeting or conference. Increasingly the word ''keynote'' is being used as a synonym for [[plenary session]] or "invited talk," with some conferences having an ''opening keynote,'' a ''closing keynote,'' and many other keynotes.

A keynote speaker may work independently, be represented by a [[speakers bureau]], or by a new crowdsourced model such as the ''speakerwiki'' website. In the event that a speaker is represented by a traditional [[speakers bureau]], a commission, typically 25%–30%, is due; however, this is traditionally and ethically absorbed by the speaker rather than the client so that the fee remains flat and transparently priced to the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Alan|title=Money talks how to make a million as a speaker|year=1998 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York|isbn=0-07-069615-2|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''key note'' comes from the practice of [[a cappella]], such as [[doo-wop]] or [[Barbershop music|barbershop singers]], playing a note before singing. The note played determines the [[Key (music)|key]] in which the song will be performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/business-career/public-speaking/what-is-a-keynote-speech |title=What Is A Keynote Speech? |publisher=Lisa B.

'''''Les Nabis''''' ({{IPA-fr|le nabi}}) were a group of [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] [[avant-garde]] artists who set the pace for [[fine arts]] and [[graphic arts]] in [[France]] in the 1890s. Initially a group of friends interested in contemporary art and literature, most of them studied at the private art school of [[Rodolphe Julian]] (the [[Académie Julian]]) in [[Paris]] in the late 1880s.

In 1890, they began to participate successfully in public exhibitions, while most of their artistic output remained in private hands or in the possession of the artists themselves. By 1896, the unity of the group had already begun to break: ''[[Homage to Cézanne]]'', painted by [[Maurice Denis]] in 1900, recollects memories of a time already gone, even before the term ''Nabis'' had been revealed to the public. Meanwhile, most members of the group, including [[Maurice Denis]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], and [[Édouard Vuillard]], could stand on their own artistically. Only [[Paul Sérusier]] had problems to overcome—though it was his ''Talisman'', painted at the advice of [[Paul Gauguin]], that had revealed to them the way to go.

==Origin of the term==
[[File:Maurice Denis Homage to Cezanne 1900.jpg|thumbnail|right|''[[Homage to Cézanne]]'', Maurice Denis, 1900. [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris.]]
''Nabi'' means ''[[prophet]]'' in both Hebrew and Arabic.{{efn|The French term ''nabi'' (also used in English), referring to a person inspired to speak the word of God, is clearly related to the Hebrew term for ''prophet''{{snd}}{{lang|he|נביא}} (''navi''){{snd}}and the similar Arabic word {{lang|ar|نَبِيّ}} (''nabiyy''). The word appears in many languages, including Indonesian.}}

''Les Nabis'' originated as a rebellious group of young student artists who banded together at the Académie Julian. Paul Sérusier galvanized ''Les Nabis'' and provided the name; he also disseminated among them the example of [[Paul Gauguin]]. [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], and [[Maurice Denis]] became the best known of the group, but at the time they were somewhat peripheral to the core group.

The term was coined by the linguist Auguste Cazalis, who drew a parallel between the way these painters aimed to revitalize painting (as ''prophets of [[modern art]]'') and the way the ancient prophets had rejuvenated Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, headword ''nabi''&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly, the nickname arose because "most of them wore beards, some were Jews and all were desperately earnest".&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, L. &amp; Hanson, E., ''Post-Impressionists'' xi. p.{{nbsp}}277&lt;/ref&gt;

''Les Nabis'' regarded themselves as initiates, and used a private vocabulary. They called a studio an ''ergasterium'' and ended their letters with the initials ''E.T.P.M.V. et M.P.'', meaning "En ta paume, mon verbe et ma pensée" (In your palm, my word and my thoughts.)

==Influence==
Meeting at [[Académie Julian]], and then at the apartment of [[Paul Ranson]], they preached that a work of art is the end product and the visual expression of an artist's synthesis of nature in personal aesthetic metaphors and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbols]]. Paving the way for the early 20th-century development of [[abstract art|abstract]] and nonrepresentational art, they had in common with most progressive artists of the time the goal of integrating art and daily life.

==Style==
[[File:Les Parisiennes cph.3g10009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pierre Bonnard]], ''Les Parisiennes'' 1893, [[lithograph]]]]
''Les Nabis'' artists worked in a variety of media, using oils on both canvas and cardboard, and [[distemper (paint)|distemper]] on canvas and wall decoration, and they also produced posters, prints, book illustrations, textiles and furniture. Considered to be on the cutting edge of modern art during their early period, their subject matter was representational (though often [[Symbolist]] in inspiration), but was design-oriented along the lines of the Japanese prints they so admired, and [[Art Nouveau]]. Unlike those types{{clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Unlike those types of what? Judging from what follows, the comparison is between one type of artist and another type of artist, but no artist types have been mentioned before this.--&gt;, however, the artists of this circle were highly influenced by the paintings of the [[Impressionists]], and thus while sharing the flatness, page layout, and negative space of art nouveau and other decorative modes, much of ''Les{{nbsp}}Nabis'' art has a painterly, non-realistic look, with color palettes reminiscent of [[Cézanne]] and Gauguin. Bonnard's posters and lithographs are more firmly in the Art Nouveau, or [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] manner. After the turn of the century, as modern art moved towards [[Abstract art|Abstraction]], [[Expressionism]], and [[Cubism]], ''Les{{nbsp}}Nabis'' were viewed as conservatives and, indeed, were among the last group of artists to stick to the roots and artistic ambitions of the Impressionists, pursuing these ends almost into the middle of the 20th{{nbsp}} century. In their later years, these painters also largely abandoned their earlier interests in decorative and applied arts.

==Members and associates==
[[File:Ranson serusier.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Ranson]], [[Paul Sérusier]], and Marie-France Ranson in Paul Ranson's studio, c. 1900]]
[[File:Ker-Xavier Roussel, Édouard Vuillard, Romain Coolus, Felix Vallotton 1899.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ker-Xavier Roussel]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], [[Romain Coolus]], [[Félix Vallotton]], 1899]]
Among the artists who considered themselves Nabis was Maurice Denis, whose journalism put the aims of the group in the eye of a progressive audience, and whose definition of a painting{{snd}}"a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order"{{cite quote|date=May 2017}}{{snd}}expressed the Nabis approach. His ''Théories'' (1920; 1922) summed up the Nabis' aims long after they had been superseded by the [[Fauvism|fauve]] painters and by cubism.

Other Nabis were Pierre Bonnard, Édouard Vuillard, [[Ker-Xavier Roussel]], Paul Ranson, and [[Félix Vallotton]]. The sculptor [[Aristide Maillol]] was associated for a time with the group. The Scot James Pitcairn-Knowles and the Hungarian Jozsef Rippl-Ronai lived together in Paris during the first decade of the 20th{{nbsp}}century and also turned to glass-blowing and woodcarving. The [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] styles they embraced skirted some aspects of contemporary art nouveau and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. The influence of the English [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] set them to work in media that involved crafts beyond painting: printmaking, book illustration and poster design, textiles, and set design.

Traditionally, ''libertarianism'' was a term for a form of [[left-wing politics]]; such [[Left-libertarianism|left-libertarian]] ideologies seek to [[Anti-capitalism|abolish capitalism]] and [[Private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]], or else to restrict their purview or effects, in favor of [[Common ownership|common]] or [[Worker cooperative|cooperative ownership]] and [[Workers' self-management|management]], viewing private property as a barrier to freedom and liberty.&lt;ref name="wrmiller"&gt;Carlson, Jennifer D.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Le libertaire 25.png|thumb|upright=0.9|The edition of 17 August 1860 of ''Le Libertaire: Journal du Mouvement Social'', a [[libertarian communist]] publication in New York]]
The first recorded use of the term "libertarian" was in 1789, when [[William Belsham]] wrote about [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]] in the context of metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Belsham|title=Essays|publisher=C. Dilly|year=1789|postscript=Original from the University of Michigan, digitized 21 May 2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z6Y0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=William+Belsham+libertarian|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Libertarian" came to mean an advocate or defender of liberty, especially in the political and social spheres, as early as 1796, when the London Packet printed on 12 February: "Lately marched out of the Prison at Bristol, 450 of the French Libertarians".&lt;ref&gt;OED November 2010 edition&lt;/ref&gt; The word was again used in a political sense in 1802 in a short piece critiquing a poem by "the author of Gebir" and has since been used with this meaning.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120802021008/http://archive.mises.org/18385/the-origin-of-libertarianism The British Critic]''. p. 432. "The author's Latin verses, which are rather more intelligible than his English, mark him for a furious Libertarian (if we may coin such a term) and a zealous admirer of France, and her liberty, under Bonaparte; such liberty!"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Robert Seeley|Seeley, John Robert]] (1878).

''[[English Historical Review]]''. 16[.3]: 419.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the word "libertarian" to describe a new set of political positions has been traced to the French cognate, ''libertaire'', coined in a letter French libertarian communist [[Joseph Déjacque]] wrote to [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Déjacque, [http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm "De l'être-humain mâle et femelle–Lettre à P.J. Proudhon"] (1857).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2009). p. 641. "The word 'libertarian' has long been associated with anarchism, and has been used repeatedly throughout this work. The term originally denoted a person who upheld the doctrine of the freedom of the will; in this sense, Godwin was not a 'libertarian', but a 'necessitarian'. It came however to be applied to anyone who approved of liberty in general. In anarchist circles, it was first used by Joseph Déjacque as the title of his anarchist journal ''Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social'' published in New York in 1858. At the end of the last century, the anarchist Sebastien Faure took up the word, to stress the difference between anarchists and authoritarian socialists."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas|volume=Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300 CE–1939)|year=2005|location=Montreal|publisher=Black Rose Books|editor=Robert Graham|chapter=|author=|at=§17|editor-link=Robert Graham (historian)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Déjacque also used the term for his anarchist publication ''Le Libertaire: Journal du Mouvement Social'', which was printed from 9 June 1858 to 4 February 1861 in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;"He called himself a "social poet," and published two volumes of heavily didactic verse—Lazaréennes and Les Pyrénées Nivelées.

In the mid-1890s, [[Sébastien Faure]] began publishing a new ''Le Libertaire'' while France's [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] enacted the ''[[lois scélérates]]'' ("villainous laws"), which banned anarchist publications in France. ''Libertarianism'' has frequently been used as a synonym for anarchism since this time.&lt;ref name=nettlau&gt;{{cite book|title=A Short History of Anarchism |last=Nettlau|first=Max|authorlink=Max Nettlau|year=1996|publisher=Freedom Press|isbn=978-0-900384-89-9|language=English|location=London|page=162|oclc=37529250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colin Ward (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kksrWshoIkYC ''Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction''], Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], p. 62.

The term "libertarianism" was first used in the United States as a synonym for [[classical liberalism]] in May 1955 by writer Dean Russell, a colleague of [[Leonard Read]] and a classical liberal himself.

He justified the choice of the word as follows: "Many of us call ourselves 'liberals.' And it is true that the word 'liberal' once described persons who respected the individual and feared the use of mass compulsions. But the leftists have now corrupted that once-proud term to identify themselves and their program of more government ownership of property and more controls over persons. As a result, those of us who believe in freedom must explain that when we call ourselves liberals, we mean liberals in the uncorrupted classical sense. At best, this is awkward and subject to misunderstanding. Here is a suggestion: Let those of us who love liberty trade-mark and reserve for our own use the good and honorable word 'libertarian'".&lt;ref name=FEE&gt;[https://fee.org/articles/where-does-the-term-libertarian-come-from-anyway/ "Where Does the Term "Libertarian" Come From Anyway?"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, a growing number of Americans with [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] beliefs in the United States began to describe themselves as "libertarian". One person responsible for popularizing the term "libertarian" in this sense was [[Murray Rothbard]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Cantor]], ''The Invisible Hand in Popular Culture: Liberty Vs. Authority in American Film and TV'', University Press of Kentucky, 2012, p. 353, n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; who started publishing libertarian works in the 1960s.  Rothbard describes this modern use of the words overtly as a 'capture' from his enemies, saying that "...for the first time in my memory, we, 'our side,' had captured a crucial word from the enemy... 'Libertarians'... had long been simply a polite word for left-wing anarchists, that is for anti-private property anarchists, either of the communist or syndicalist variety. But now we had taken it over..."&lt;ref name="CubanAnarchism"&gt;Fernandez, Frank (2001). ''Cuban Anarchism. The History of a Movement''. Sharp Press. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jKdztbIaHegC p. 9].

== Philosophy ==
There is contention about whether left and right libertarianism "represent distinct ideologies as opposed to variations on a theme".&lt;ref name="geodist"&gt;Carlson (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=tYME6Z35nyAC&amp;pg=PA1006&amp;dq=right-libertarianism&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=right-libertarianism p. 1007]. "In contrast to the United States, where a right-libertarian sensibility dominates, western European nations with strong leftist political parties tend to see the emergence of left-libertarian parties, as detailed by Kent Redding and Jocelyn S. Viterna. According to them, these parties are united by their 'critique of the statist and bureaucratic tendencies of modern welfare states... inequality and environmental degradation produced by capitalist market economies.'"&lt;/ref&gt;  All libertarians begin with a conception of [[Autonomy|personal autonomy]] from which they argue in favor of civil liberties and a reduction or elimination of the state.

[[Left-libertarianism]] encompasses those libertarian beliefs that claim the Earth's natural resources belong to everyone in an egalitarian manner, either unowned or owned collectively.  Contemporary left-libertarians such as [[Hillel Steiner]], [[Peter Vallentyne]], [[Philippe Van Parijs]], [[Michael Otsuka]] and [[David Ellerman]] believe the appropriation of land must leave "[[Lockean proviso|enough and as good]]" for others or be taxed by society to compensate for the exclusionary effects of private property. [[Libertarian socialist]]s ([[Social anarchism|social]] and [[individualist anarchist]]s, [[libertarian Marxist]]s, [[council communist]]s, [[Luxemburgist]]s and [[DeLeonist]]s) promote [[usufruct]] and [[socialist]] economic theories, including [[communism]], [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[syndicalism]] and [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].  They criticize the state for being the defender of private property and believe capitalism entails [[wage slavery]].

[[Right-libertarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;"'Libertarian' and 'libertarianism' are frequently employed by anarchists as synonyms for 'anarchist' and 'anarchism', largely as an attempt to distance themselves from the negative connotations of 'anarchy' and its derivatives. The situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitalism, 'minimal statism' and an extreme right-wing laissez-faire philosophy advocated by such theorists as Rothbard and Nozick and their adoption of the words 'libertarian' and 'libertarianism'. It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition." Goodway, David (2006). ''[[Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow: Left-Libertarian Thought and British Writers from William Morris to Colin Ward]]''. Liverpool: Liverpool University Press. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; developed in the United States in the mid-20th century and is the most popular conception of libertarianism in that region.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (2012). p. 1007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly referred to as a continuation or radicalization of [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Boaz, David (1998).

Essentially, we believe all Americans should be free to live their lives and pursue their interests as they see fit as long as they do no harm to another."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarcho-capitalist]]s&lt;ref&gt;"It is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by the same name (for example, Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism)."

[[Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism]]. London: Harper Perennial. p. 565. "In fact, few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice, Their self-interested, calculating market men would be incapable of practicing voluntary co-operation and mutual aid. Anarcho-capitalists, even if they do reject the State, might therefore best be called right-wing libertarians rather than anarchists."&lt;/ref&gt; seek complete elimination of the state in favor of [[Dispute resolution organization|privately funded security services]] while [[minarchist]]s defend "[[night-watchman state]]s", which maintain only those functions of government necessary to maintain conditions of capitalism and personal security.

=== Personal autonomy ===
{{anchor|Personal autonomy}}
Anarchism envisages freedom as a form of autonomy,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2009). p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]] describes as "the ability to initiate a task and do it one's own way, without orders from authorities who do not know the actual problem and the available means".&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Paul (1972). ''Little Prayers and Finite Experience''.&lt;/ref&gt;  All anarchists oppose political and legal authority, but collectivist strains also oppose the economic authority of private property.&lt;ref name="Marshall 2009. pp. 42-43"&gt;Marshall (2009). pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; These social anarchists emphasize mutual aid, whereas individualist anarchists extol individual sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2009). pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some right-libertarians consider the [[non-aggression principle]] (NAP) to be a core part of their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/the-morality-of-libertarianism/|title=The Morality of Libertarianism |publisher=The Future of Freedom Foundation|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/block/block26.html|title=The Non-Aggression Axiom of Libertarianism|publisher=[[Lew Rockwell]]|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free love appeared alongside [[anarcha-feminism]] and advocacy of [[LGBT rights]]. Anarcha-feminism developed as a synthesis of [[radical feminism]] and anarchism and views [[patriarchy]] as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government. It was inspired by the late-19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] and [[Virginia Bolten]].

Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and [[gender roles]]. ''[[Free Society]]'' (1895–1897 as ''The Firebrand'', 1897–1904 as ''Free Society'') was an anarchist newspaper in the United States that staunchly advocated free love and women's rights, while criticizing "[[comstockery]]", the censorship of sexual information.&lt;ref name="Goldman-MSF-551"&gt;''Emma Goldman: Making Speech Free, 1902–1909''. p. 551.

A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' were prominent figures in both free thought and anarchism.

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free-thinker [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established "modern" or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Fidler"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geoffrey C.

Later in the 20th century, Austrian [[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] [[Wilhelm Reich]] became a consistent propagandist for sexual freedom going as far as opening free sex-counseling clinics in Vienna for working-class patients&lt;ref&gt;Sex-Pol stood for the German Society of Proletarian Sexual Politics. Danto writes that Reich offered a mixture of "psychoanalytic counseling, Marxist advice and contraceptives," and argued for a sexual permissiveness, including for young people and the unmarried, that unsettled other psychoanalysts and the political left. The clinics were immediately overcrowded by people seeking help. Danto, Elizabeth Ann (2007). ''Freud's Free Clinics: Psychoanalysis &amp; Social Justice'', 1918–1938, Columbia University Press, first published 2005., pp. 118–120, 137, 198, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as coining the phrase "[[sexual revolution]]" in one of his books from the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;The Sexual Revolution, 1945 (Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf, translated by Theodore P. Wolfe)&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1970s, the English anarchist and pacifist [[Alex Comfort]] achieved international celebrity for writing the sex manuals ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' and ''More Joy of Sex''.

=== State ===
Many left-libertarians are anarchists and believe the state inherently violates personal autonomy: "As Robert Paul Wolff has argued, since 'the state is authority, the right to rule', anarchism which rejects the State is the only political doctrine consistent with autonomy in which the individual alone is the judge of his moral constraints".&lt;ref name="Marshall 2009. pp. 42-43"/&gt; Social anarchists believe the state defends private property, which they view as intrinsically harmful, while [[Left-wing market anarchism|market-oriented left-libertarians]] argue that so-called free markets actually consist of economic privileges granted by the state. These latter libertarians advocate instead for freed markets, which are freed from these privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Chartier, Gary. Johnson, Charles W. (2011).

There is a debate amongst right-libertarians as to whether or not the state is legitimate: while anarcho-capitalists advocate its abolition, minarchists support minimal states, often referred to as night-watchman states. Libertarians take a skeptical view of government authority.&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shermer|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Shermer|date=22 May 2009|url=http://media.libsyn.com/media/pointofinquiry/POI_2009_05_22_Michael_Shermer.mp3|title=Michael Shermer – Science, Skepticism and Libertarianism|work=[[Point of Inquiry]]|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2014}} Minarchists maintain that the state is necessary for the protection of individuals from aggression, theft, [[breach of contract]] and fraud.

They justify the state on the grounds that it is the [[logical consequence]] of adhering to the non-aggression principle and argue that anarchism is immoral because it implies that the non-aggression principle is optional, that the enforcement of laws under anarchism is open to competition.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Another common justification is that [[private defense]] agencies and [[Dispute resolution organizations|court]] firms would tend to represent the interests of those who pay them enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Government: Unnecessary but Inevitable|author=Holcombe, Randall G.|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_08_3_holcombe.pdf|archivedate=5 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705120549/http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_08_3_holcombe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-capitalists argue that the state violates the [[non-aggression principle]] (NAP) by its nature because governments use force against those who have not stolen or vandalized private property, assaulted anyone or committed fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roderick Long|Long, Roderick]], [http://praxeology.net/Anarconst2.pdf Market Anarchism as Constitutionalism], ''[http://praxeology.net/anarcres.htm Molinari Institute]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plauché, Geoffrey Allan (2006).

Right-libertarians maintain that unowned natural resources "may be appropriated by the first person who discovers them, [[Labor theory of property|mixes his labor with them]], or merely claims them—without the consent of others, and with little or no payment to them". They believe that natural resources are originally unowned and therefore private parties may appropriate them at will without the consent of, or owing to, others.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Lawrence C.; Becker, Charlotte B.

=== Economics ===
Left-libertarians (social and individualist anarchists, libertarian Marxists and left-wing market anarchists) argue in favor of socialist theories such as communism, syndicalism and mutualism ([[anarchist economics]]). Daniel Guérin writes that "anarchism is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man. Anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the State".&lt;ref name="Guérin 1970"&gt;Guérin (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

Right-libertarians are [[economic liberal]]s of either the [[Austrian School]] or [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school]] and support ''laissez-faire'' capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://mises.org/library/classical-liberalism-and-austrian-school-0|title=Classical Liberalism and the Austrian School|last=Raico|first=Ralph|date=2012|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=9781610160032|location=Auburn, Alabama|page=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wage labor ===
[[Wage labor]] has long been compared by socialists and [[anarcho-syndicalist]]s to slavery.&lt;ref name="English Working Class p. 599"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English Working Class p. 912"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ostergaard|1997|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shop Floor p. 37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lazonick|1990|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the term "wage slavery" is often utilized as a pejorative for wage labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallgrimsdottir|Benoit|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Roediger|2007a}}.&lt;br&gt;The term is not without its critics, as {{Harvnb|Roediger|2007b|p=247}}, notes: "[T]he challenge to loose connections of wage (or white) slavery to chattel slavery was led by [[Frederick Douglass]] and other Black, often fugitive, abolitionists. Their challenge was mercilessly concrete. Douglass, who tried out speeches in work places before giving them in halls, was far from unable to speak to or hear white workers, but he and [[William Wells Brown]] did challenge metaphors regarding white slavery sharply. They noted, for example, that their escapes from slavery had left job openings and wondered if any white workers wanted to take the jobs."&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of slavery looked upon the "comparative evils of Slave Society and of Free Society, of slavery to human Masters and slavery to Capital"&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitzhugh|1857|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ECdb7EjiBnEC&amp;pg=PR16 xvi]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proceeded to argue that wage slavery was actually ''worse'' than [[chattel slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carsel|1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery apologists like [[George Fitzhugh]] contended that workers only accepted wage labor with the passage of time, as they became "familiarized and inattentive to the infected social atmosphere they continually inhale[d]".&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;

According to [[Noam Chomsky]], analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era. In his 1791 book ''On the Limits of State Action'', classical liberal thinker [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] explained how "whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness" and so when the laborer works under external control "we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chomsky|1993|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DIpW10rWZFAC&amp;pg=PA19 19]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marxists, labour-as-commodity, which is how they regard wage labor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1990|p=1006}}: "[L]abor-power, a commodity sold by the worker himself."&lt;/ref&gt; provides an absolutely fundamental point of attack against capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Another one, of course, being the capitalists' theft from workers via [[surplus-value]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It can be persuasively argued", noted philosopher John Nelson, "that the conception of the worker's labor as a commodity confirms Marx's stigmatization of the wage system of private capitalism as 'wage-slavery;' that is, as an instrument of the capitalist's for reducing the worker's condition to that of a slave, if not below it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=John O.|year=1995|title=That a Worker's Labour Cannot Be a Commodity|journal=[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]|volume=70|issue=272|page=158|jstor=3751199|ref=harv|doi=10.1017/s0031819100065359}}. This Marxist objection is what motivated Nelson's essay, which argues that labur is not, in fact, a commodity.&lt;/ref&gt;

That this objection is fundamental follows immediately from Marx's conclusion that wage labor is the very foundation of capitalism: "Without a class dependent on wages, the moment individuals confront each other as free persons, there can be no production of surplus value; without the production of surplus-value there can be no capitalist production, and hence no capital and no capitalist!".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1990|p=1005}}. Emphasis in the original.&lt;br&gt;See also p. 716: "[T]he capitalist produces [and reproduces] the worker as a wage-laborer. This incessant reproduction, this perpetuation of the worker, is the absolutely necessary condition for capitalist production."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prominent currents ==
=== Left-libertarianism ===
{{main|Left-libertarianism}}
Left-libertarianism (or classical libertarianism) names several related, but distinct approaches to [[political]] and social theory which stresses both [[Political freedom|individual freedom]] and [[social equality]]. In its classical usage, left-libertarianism is a synonym for [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] varieties of [[left-wing politics]], i.e. [[libertarian socialism]], which includes [[anarchism]] and [[libertarian Marxism]], among others.&lt;ref name="routledge-anarchism"&gt;Anarchism". In Gaus, Gerald F.; D'Agostino, Fred, eds. (2012). ''The Routledge Companion to Social and Political Philosophy''. p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bookchinreader"&gt;Bookchin, Murray and Biehl, Janet (1997). ''The Murray Bookchin Reader''. Cassell: p. 170. {{ISBN|0-304-33873-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left-libertarianism can also refer to political positions associated with academic philosophers [[Hillel Steiner]], [[Philippe Van Parijs]] and [[Peter Vallentyne]] that combine [[self-ownership]] with an egalitarian approach to natural resources.&lt;ref name="oxfordcompanion"&gt;[[Will Kymlicka|Kymlicka, Will]] (2005). "libertarianism, left-". In [[Ted Honderich|Honderich, Ted]]. ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. New York City: [[Oxford University Press]].  p. 516.  {{ISBN|978-0199264797}}. "'Left-libertarianism' is a new term for an old conception of justice, dating back to Grotius. It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premise that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. However, according to left-libertarians the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property. Historic proponents of this view include Thomas Paine, Herbert Spencer, and Henry George. Recent exponents include Philippe Van Parijs and Hillel Steiner."&lt;/ref&gt;

While maintaining full respect for [[personal property]], left-libertarians are skeptical of or fully against [[private property]], arguing that neither claiming nor [[Labor theory of property|mixing one's labor]] with [[natural resource]]s is enough to generate full [[Right to property|private property rights]]&lt;ref name="socialhistory"&gt;Carlson, Jennifer D.

Those left-libertarians who support private property do so under the condition that recompense is offered to the [[local community]].&lt;ref name="rhteol"/&gt; Many left-libertarian schools of thought are [[communist]], advocating the eventual replacement of money with [[labor voucher]]s or [[decentralized planning]].

On the other hand, [[left-wing market anarchism]], which includes [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]]'s [[agorism]], appeals to left-wing concerns such as [[egalitarianism]], [[gender]] and [[Sexual identity|sexuality]], [[Social class|class]], [[immigration]] and [[environmentalism]] within the paradigm of a [[Market socialism|socialist free market]].&lt;ref name="routledge-anarchism"/&gt; [[Joseph Déjacque]] was the first to formulate classical libertarian ideas under the term ''libertarian.'' Later philosophers on the [[Left-wing politics|left]] would go onto adding detail to his political philosophy, to study and document attitudes and themes relating to stateless socialism (for Déjacque, [[Anarcho-communism|libertarian communism]]).

=== Right-libertarianism ===
{{main|Right-libertarianism}}
Right-libertarianism (or right-wing libertarianism) refers to libertarian [[political philosophies]] that advocate [[Negative and positive rights|negative rights]], [[natural law]] and a major reversal of the modern [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Ideologies|last=Baradat|first=Leon P.|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-1317345558|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Right-libertarians strongly support [[property rights (economics)|private property rights]] and defend market [[Appropriation (economics)|distribution]] of [[natural resources]] and [[private property]].&lt;ref&gt;Kymlicka, Will (2005) "libertarianism, left-". In Honderich, Ted. ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy: New Edition''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 516. {{ISBN|978-0199264797}}. "Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land."&lt;/ref&gt; This position is contrasted with that of some versions of [[left-libertarianism]], which maintain that natural resources belong to everyone in an [[egalitarian]] manner, either unowned or [[owned collectively]].&lt;ref&gt;Vallentyne, Peter (2007).

Cambridge University Press. Retrieved 13 June 2013. {{ISBN|978-0521703055}}. "The best-known versions of libertarianism are right-libertarian theories, which hold that agents have a very strong moral power to acquire full private property rights in external things. Left-libertarians, by contrast, hold that natural resources (e.g., space, land, minerals, air, and water) belong to everyone in some egalitarian manner and thus cannot be appropriated without the consent of, or significant payment to, the members of society."&lt;/ref&gt; Right-libertarianism includes [[anarcho-capitalism]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]'', [[minarchist]] [[Classical liberalism|liberalism]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;* Marshall, Peter (2008). ''[[Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism]]''. London: Harper Perennial. p. 565. "In its moderate form, right libertarianism embraces ''laissez-faire'' liberals like Robert Nozick who call for a minimal State, and in its extreme form, anarcho-capitalists like Murray Rothbard and David Friedman who entirely repudiate the role of the State and look to the market as a means of ensuring social order".

"'Libertarian' and 'libertarianism' are frequently employed by anarchists as synonyms for 'anarchist' and 'anarchism', largely as an attempt to distance themselves from the negative connotations of 'anarchy' and its derivatives. The situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitalism, 'minimal statism' and an extreme right-wing ''laissez-faire'' philosophy advocated by such theorists as Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick and their adoption of the words 'libertarian' and 'libertarianism'. It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition".

"It is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by the same name (for example, Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism). There is a complex debate within this tradition between those like Robert Nozick, who advocate a 'minimal state', and those like Rothbard who want to do away with the state altogether and allow all transactions to be governed by the market alone. From an anarchist perspective, however, both positions—the minimal state (minarchist) and the no-state ('anarchist') positions—neglect the problem of economic domination; in other words, they neglect the hierarchies, oppressions, and forms of exploitation that would inevitably arise in a ''laissez-faire'' 'free' market. [...] Anarchism, therefore, has no truck with this right-wing libertarianism, not only because it neglects economic inequality and domination, but also because in practice (and theory) it is highly inconsistent and contradictory. The individual freedom invoked by right-wing libertarians is only a narrow economic freedom within the constraints of a capitalist market, which, as anarchists show, is no freedom at all".&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhere in between these two poles lies the contemporary situation of most citizens of Western democracies: a relatively open public sphere but a quotidian institutional experience that is largely at cross purposes with the implicit assumptions behind this public sphere and encouraging and often rewarding caution, deference, servility, and conformity."&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas Paine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Roderick T|year=1998|title=Toward a Libertarian Theory of Class|url=|journal=Social Philosophy and Policy|volume=15|issue=2|page=310|doi=10.1017/s0265052500002028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Locke greatly influenced both libertarianism and the modern world in his writings published before and after the [[Glorious Revolution|English Revolution of 1688]], especially ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]'' (1667), ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' (1689) and ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690). In the text of 1689, he established the basis of liberal political theory: that people's rights existed before government; that the purpose of government is to protect personal and property rights; that people may dissolve governments that do not do so; and that representative government is the best form to protect rights.&lt;ref&gt;David Boaz, ''The Libertarian Reader: Classic and Contemporary Writings from Lao Tzu to Milton Friedman'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cMs6OaHu6iEC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=John+Locke+libertarian&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Locke%20libertarian p. 123], {{ISBN|1439118337}}, {{ISBN|9781439118337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] was inspired by Locke in its statement: "[T]o secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]]. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it".&lt;ref name=Rothbard1&gt;Murray Rothbard, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard121.html The Libertarian Heritage: The American Revolution and Classical Liberalism], excerpted from Rothbard's ''[[For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto]]'', 1973; published at [[LewRockwell.com]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless scholar [[Ellen Meiksins Wood]] says that "there are doctrines of individualism that are opposed to Lockean individualism... and non-Lockean individualism may encompass socialism".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ellen Meiksins Wood]]. ''Mind and Politics: An Approach to the Meaning of Liberal and Socialist Individualism''. [[University of California Press]]. 1972. {{ISBN|0-520-02029-4}}. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Murray Rothbard, the libertarian creed emerged from the classical liberal challenges to an "absolute central State and a king ruling by divine right on top of an older, restrictive web of feudal land monopolies and urban guild controls and restrictions", the [[mercantilism]] of a bureaucratic warfaring state allied with privileged merchants. The object of classical liberals was individual liberty in the economy, in personal freedoms and civil liberty, separation of state and religion, and peace as an alternative to imperial aggrandizement. He cites Locke's contemporaries, the Levellers, who held similar views. Also influential were the English "[[Cato's Letters]]" during the early 1700s, reprinted eagerly by [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonists]] who already were free of European aristocracy and feudal land monopolies.&lt;ref name=Rothbard1/&gt;

In January 1776, only two years after coming to America from England, Thomas Paine published his pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' calling for independence for the colonies.&lt;ref name=Sprading&gt;Charles T. Sprading, ''Liberty and the Great Libertarians'', 1913; republished 1995 by [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=STQJ_DjQuw8C&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Thomas+Paine+libertarian&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=Thomas%20Paine%20libertarian p. 74], {{ISBN|1610161076}}, {{ISBN|9781610161077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paine promoted classical liberal ideas in clear, concise language that allowed the general public to understand the debates among the political elites.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Hoffman, "Paine and Prejudice: Rhetorical Leadership through Perceptual Framing in Common Sense," ''Rhetoric and Public Affairs,'' Fall 2006, Vol. 9 Issue 3, pp. 373–410.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Common Sense'' was immensely popular in disseminating these ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Maier, ''American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence'' (New York: Knopf, 1997), pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; selling hundreds of thousands of copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hitchens, Christopher|title=Thomas Paine's Rights of Man|year=2006|isbn=0-8021-4383-0|publisher=Grove Press|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paine later would write the ''[[Rights of Man]]'' and ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' and participate in the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=Sprading/&gt; Paine's theory of property showed a "libertarian concern" with the redistribution of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamb|first1=Robert|year=2010|title=Liberty, Equality, and the Boundaries of Ownership: Thomas Paine's Theory of Property Rights|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/53895913/liberty-equality-boundaries-ownership-thomas-paines-theory-property-rights|journal=Review of Politics|volume=72|issue=3|pages=483–511|doi=10.1017/s0034670510000331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793, [[William Godwin]] wrote a libertarian philosophical treatise, ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Morals and Happiness]]'', which criticized ideas of human rights and of society by contract based on vague promises. He took classical liberalism to its logical anarchic conclusion by rejecting all political institutions, law, government and apparatus of coercion as well as all political protest and insurrection. Instead of institutionalized justice, Godwin proposed that people influence one another to moral goodness through informal reasoned persuasion, including in the associations they joined as this would facilitate happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Ousby, ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1993, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oeZ226OlfbkC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=Political+Ideology+Today+william+godwin+libertarian&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=Political%20Ideology%20Today%20william%20godwin%20libertarian p. 305], {{ISBN|0521440866}}, {{ISBN|9780521440868}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Happiness]]|last=Godwin|first=William|authorlink=William Godwin|publisher=G.G. and J.

=== Rise of anarchism ===
{{main|History of anarchism}}
[[File:Pierre Joseph Proudhon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]]]
Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment, particularly Jean-Jacques Rousseau's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;"Anarchism", ''[[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia'' 2006 (UK version).&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution, William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought.&lt;ref&gt;Everhart, Robert B. The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society. Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1982. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="godwinsep"/&gt; According to [[Peter Kropotkin]], Godwin was "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work",&lt;ref name="EB1910"&gt;Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html "Anarchism"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to Edmund Burke's '' [[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. "Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence..." – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism. He argued in ''Political Justice'' (1793)&lt;ref name="godwinsep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, Godwin advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.&lt;ref name="godwinsep"&gt;{{cite SEP|url-id=godwin|title=William Godwin|last=Philip|first=Mark|date=20 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]]|last=Godwin|first=William|authorlink=William Godwin|year=1796|publisher=G.G. and J. Robinson|oclc=2340417|origyear=1793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people's "mental enslavement", the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage. Godwin considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organization. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.

In France, various anarchist currents were present during the Revolutionary period, with some revolutionaries using the term ''anarchiste'' in a positive light as early as September 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. ''Anarchism'', London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[enragés]]'' opposed revolutionary government as a contradiction in terms. Denouncing the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]] dictatorship, [[Jean Varlet]] wrote in 1794 that "government and revolution are incompatible, unless the people wishes to set its constituted authorities in permanent insurrection against itself".&lt;ref name=graham/&gt; In his "Manifesto of the Equals", [[Sylvain Maréchal]] looked forward to the disappearance, once and for all, of "the revolting distinction between rich and poor, of great and small, of masters and valets, of governors and governed".&lt;ref name=graham&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Robert|chapter=Preface|title=[[Anarchism: a Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas: from Anarchy to Anarchism]]|publisher=Black Rose Books|location=Montréal|year=2005|isbn=1-55164-250-6|authorlink=Robert Graham (historian)|pages=xi–xiv|accessdate=11 August 2010|chapter-url=http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian socialism, [[libertarian communism]] and [[libertarian Marxism]] are all phrases which activists with a variety of perspectives have applied to their views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Alexander_Berkman__What_Is_Communist_Anarchism_.html "What is Communist Anarchism?"] [[Alexander Berkman]], in ''[[Now and After]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist communist philosopher Joseph Déjacque was the first person to describe himself as a libertarian.&lt;ref name="Dejacque"&gt;Joseph Déjacque. [http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle – Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in French).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike mutualist anarchist philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, he argued that "it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature".&lt;ref name="Graham-2005"&gt;Robert Graham, ''Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas – Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300 CE to 1939)'', Black Rose Books, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"l'Echange", article in ''Le Libertaire'' no 6, 21 September 1858, New York. [http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/libertaire/n06/lib01.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to anarchist historian [[Max Nettlau]], the first use of the term "libertarian communism" was in November 1880, when a French anarchist congress employed it to more clearly identify its doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Short History of Anarchism|last=Nettlau|first=Max|authorlink=Max Nettlau|year=1996|publisher=Freedom Press|isbn=0-900384-89-1|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French anarchist journalist Sébastien Faure started the weekly paper ''Le Libertaire'' (''The Libertarian'') in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Short History of Anarchism|last=Nettlau|first=Max|authorlink=Max Nettlau|year=1996|publisher=Freedom Press|isbn=0-900384-89-1|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name="ryner"&gt;"What do I mean by individualism? I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience."[https://web.archive.org/web/20080906233034/http://www.marx.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tucker"&gt;"I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty.

[[Murray Bookchin]] wrote that the Spanish libertarian movement of the mid-1930s was unique because its workers' control and collectives—which came out of a three-generation "massive libertarian movement"—divided the republican camp and challenged the Marxists. "Urban anarchists" created libertarian communist forms of organization which evolved into the CNT, a syndicalist union providing the infrastructure for a libertarian society. Also formed were local bodies to administer social and economic life on a decentralized libertarian basis. Much of the infrastructure was destroyed during the 1930s Spanish Civil War against authoritarian and fascist forces.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin, ''To Remember Spain: The Anarchist and Syndicalist Revolution of 1936'', AK Press, 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1DzxkWr0X60C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=To+Remember+Spain:+The+Anarchist+and+Syndicalist+Revolution+libertarian&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=Libertarian pp. 2–39], {{ISBN|9781873176870}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the [[Sydney Push]] was a predominantly left-wing intellectual subculture in [[Sydney]] from the late 1940s to the early 1970s which became associated with the label "Sydney libertarianism".

In 1969, French [[platformist]] anarcho-communist [[Daniel Guérin]] published an essay in 1969 called "Libertarian Marxism?" in which he dealt with the debate between [[Karl Marx]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]] at the [[First International]] and afterwards suggested that "[L]ibertarian Marxism rejects determinism and fatalism, giving the greater place to individual will, intuition, imagination, reflex speeds, and to the deep instincts of the masses, which are more far-seeing in hours of crisis than the reasonings of the 'elites'; libertarian Marxism thinks of the effects of surprise, provocation and boldness, refuses to be cluttered and paralyzed by a heavy 'scientific' apparatus, doesn't equivocate or bluff, and guards itself from adventurism as much as from fear of the unknown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Libertarian_Marxism_.html|title=Libertarian Marxism? – The Anarchist Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individualism in the United States ===
[[File:Josiah Warren.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Josiah Warren]]]]
The indigenous anarchist tradition in the United States was largely [[Individualism|individualist]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall.  p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1825, Josiah Warren became aware of the social system of [[utopian socialist]] [[Robert Owen]] and began to talk with others in Cincinnati about founding a [[communist]] colony.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Josiah (17 February 1872).  "The Motives for Communism—How It Worked and What It Led To".  ''Woodhull and Claflin's Weekly''.  '''IV''': 14.  p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

When this group failed to come to an agreement about the form and goals of their proposed community, Warren "sold his factory after only two years of operation, packed up his young family, and took his place as one of 900 or so Owenites who had decided to become part of the founding population of [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]], Indiana".&lt;ref name=Mises&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riggenbach|first=Jeff|title=Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist |journal=Mises Daily |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |date=25 February 2011|url=https://mises.org/daily/5067/Josiah-Warren-The-First-American-Anarchist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warren termed the phrase "[[cost the limit of price]]"&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Josiah.  ''Equitable Commerce''.  "A watch has a ''cost'' and a ''value''.  The COST consists of the amount of labor bestowed on the mineral or natural wealth, in converting it into metals..."&lt;/ref&gt; and "proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce".&lt;ref name=Slate2/&gt; He put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental labor-for-labor store called the [[Cincinnati Time Store]] where trade was facilitated by [[labor note]]s.

The store proved successful and operated for three years, after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism, including [[Utopia, Ohio|Utopia]] and [[past and present anarchist communities#Modern Times (1851 to late 1860s)|Modern Times]]. "After New Harmony failed, Warren shifted his ideological loyalties from socialism to anarchism (which was no great leap, given that Owen's socialism had been predicated on Godwin's anarchism)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Peter_Sabatini__Libertarianism__Bogus_Anarchy.html|title=Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy – The Anarchist Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist&lt;ref name=Slate2&gt;Palmer, Brian (29 December 2010) [http://www.slate.com/id/2279457/ What do anarchists want from us?], ''[[Slate.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the four-page weekly paper ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'' he edited during 1833 was the first anarchist periodical published,&lt;ref name="bailie20"/&gt; an enterprise for which he built his own printing press, cast his own type and made his own printing plates.&lt;ref name="bailie20"/&gt;

Catalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the intentional communal experiments pioneered by Warren were influential in [[European individualist anarchist]]s of the late 19th and early 20th centuries such as [[Émile Armand]] and the [[intentional communities]] started by them.&lt;ref name="tesisenxarxa.net"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721040723/http://www.tesisenxarxa.net/TESIS_UdG/AVAILABLE/TDX...//txdr1de2.pdf Xavier Diez.  ''L'ANARQUISME INDIVIDUALISTA A ESPANYA 1923–1938'']  p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Warren said that Stephen Pearl Andrews, individualist anarchist and close associate, wrote the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories in ''The Science of Society'', published in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madison|first1=Charles A.|year=1945|title=Anarchism in the United States|url=|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=1|issue=6|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews was formerly associated with the [[Fourierist]] movement, but converted to radical individualism after becoming acquainted with the work of Warren. Like Warren, he held the principle of "individual sovereignty" as being of paramount importance. Contemporary American anarchist [[Hakim Bey]] reports: {{quote|Steven Pearl Andrews... was not a Fourierist, but he lived through the brief craze for phalansteries in America and adopted a lot of Fourierist principles and practices... a maker of worlds out of words.  He syncretized abolitionism in the United States, free love, spiritual universalism, Warren, and Fourier into a grand utopian scheme he called the Universal Pantarchy...  He was instrumental in founding several 'intentional communities,' including the 'Brownstone Utopia' on 14th St. in New York, and 'Modern Times' in Brentwood, Long Island.  The latter became as famous as the best-known Fourierist communes (Brook Farm in Massachusetts &amp; the North American Phalanx in New Jersey)—in fact, Modern Times became downright notorious (for 'Free Love') and finally foundered under a wave of scandalous publicity.  Andrews (and Victoria Woodhull) were members of the infamous Section 12 of the 1st International, expelled by Marx for its anarchist, feminist, and spiritualist tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hakim Bey|Bey, Hakim]].

For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, "[it is apparent... that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews.  William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"&gt;Schuster, Eunice Minette.

Greene is best known for the works ''Mutual Banking'', which proposed an interest-free banking system; and ''Transcendentalism'', a critique of the New England philosophical school.

After 1850, he became active in labor reform.&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; "He was elected vice-president of the New England Labor Reform League, the majority of the members holding to Proudhon's scheme of mutual banking, and in 1869 president of the Massachusetts Labor Union".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; Greene then published ''Socialistic, Mutualistic, and Financial Fragments'' (1875).&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; He saw mutualism as the synthesis of "liberty and order".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt; His "associationism... is checked by individualism... 'Mind your own business,' 'Judge not that ye be not judged.' Over matters which are purely personal, as for example, moral conduct, the individual is sovereign, as well as over that which he himself produces.  For this reason he demands 'mutuality' in marriage—the equal right of a woman to her own personal freedom and property".&lt;ref name="againstallauthority.org"/&gt;

Poet, naturalist and [[transcendentalist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. He is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings; and his essay ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'' (''Resistance to Civil Government''), an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. In ''Walden'', Thoreau advocates simple living and self-sufficiency among natural surroundings in resistance to the advancement of industrial civilization.&lt;ref name="Thoreau"&gt;"Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock(8), esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX."

''Civil Disobedience'', first published in 1849, argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. These works influenced [[green anarchism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[anarcho-pacifism]],&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; as well as figures including [[Mohandas Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Martin Buber]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence|title=Resisting the nation state|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarcho-primitivism represented today in [[John Zerzan]].

Early proponents of this view include Thomas Paine, Herbert Spencer, and [[Hugo Grotius]],&lt;ref name="oxfordcompanion"/&gt; but the concept was widely popularized by the economist and social reformer [[Henry George]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foldvary|first=Fred|title=Geoism Explained|url=http://www.progress.org/views/editorials/geoism-explained/|publisher=The Progress Report|accessdate=12 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317210356/http://www.progress.org/views/editorials/geoism-explained/|archivedate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; George believed that people ought to own the fruits of their labor and the value of the improvements they make, thus he was opposed to income taxes, sales taxes, taxes on improvements and all other taxes on production, labor, trade or commerce.

George was among the staunchest defenders of [[free market]]s and his book ''[[Protection or Free Trade]]'' was read into the U.S. Congressional Record.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/ei/ei0502.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Yet he did support direct management of [[natural monopolies]] as a last resort, such as right-of-way monopolies necessary for railroads. George advocated for elimination of intellectual property arrangements in favor of government sponsored prizes for inventors.&lt;ref&gt;George, Henry. ''Progress and Poverty''. (1879; Garden City, NY: Doubleday 1912).&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2014}}&lt;!-- "Our boasted freedom necessarily involves slavery, so long as we recognize private property in land. Until that is abolished, Declarations of Independence and Acts of Emancipation are in vain. So long as one man can claim the exclusive ownership of the land from which other men must live, slavery will exist, and as material progress goes on, must grow and deepen!" – Henry George --&gt;

Early followers of George's philosophy called themselves [[single tax]]ers because they believed that the only legitimate, broad-based tax was [[land rent]]. The term Georgism was coined later, though some modern proponents prefer the term Geoism instead,&lt;ref name="Casal 2011 307–327"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Casal|first=Paula|title=Global Taxes on Natural Resources|journal=Journal of Moral Philosophy|year=2011|volume=8|issue=3|pages=307–27|url=http://www.unipa.it/dottoratodirittocomparato/sites/default/files/20052009/Materiale%20Casal%282%29.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2014|quote=It can also invoke Geoism, a philosophical tradition encompassing the views of John Locke and Henry George ...|doi=10.1163/174552411x591339}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the meaning of "geo" (Earth in Greek) deliberately ambiguous.

(1994). ''The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty (1881–1908)''. Transaction Publishers. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lysander Spooner, besides his individualist anarchist activism, was also an anti-slavery activist and member of the First International.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, George (1962). ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements''. p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker argued that the elimination of what he called "the four monopolies"—the land monopoly, the money and banking monopoly, the monopoly powers conferred by patents and the quasi-monopolistic effects of tariffs—would undermine the power of the wealthy and big business, making possible widespread property ownership and higher incomes for ordinary people, while minimizing the power of would-be bosses and achieving socialist goals without state action. Tucker's anarchist periodical, ''Liberty'', was published from August 1881 to April 1908.

The publication, emblazoned with Proudhon's quote that liberty is "Not the Daughter But the Mother of Order" was instrumental in developing and formalizing the individualist anarchist philosophy through publishing essays and serving as a forum for debate. Contributors included Benjamin Tucker, Lysander Spooner, [[Auberon Herbert]], [[Dyer Lum]], [[Joshua K. Ingalls]], John Henry Mackay, [[Victor Yarros]], [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe]], [[James L. Walker]], [[J. William Lloyd]], [[Florence Finch Kelly]], Voltairine de Cleyre, [[Steven T.

They included: ''I'' published by C.L. Swartz, edited by W.E. Gordak and [[J.W. Lloyd]] (all associates of ''Liberty''); ''The Ego'' and ''The Egoist'', both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German ''[[Der Eigene]]'', edited by Adolf Brand, and ''The Eagle'' and ''The Serpent'', issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle 'A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology'".&lt;ref name="Ref_ad"/&gt;

=== Modern American libertarianism ===
{{main|Libertarianism in the United States}}
By around the start of the 20th century, the heyday of individualist anarchism had passed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]]. 2006. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. [[AK Press]]. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. L. Mencken]] and [[Albert Jay Nock]] were the first prominent figures in the United States to describe themselves as libertarians;&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;{{Cite book|title=Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right|last=Burns|first=Jennifer|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-532487-7|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z6e9X6JxHpMC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=Goddess+of+the+Market+Nock+Menken#v=onepage&amp;q=Goddess%20of%20the%20Market%20Nock%20Menken|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; they believed [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had co-opted the word "liberal" for his [[New Deal]] policies which they opposed and used "libertarian" to signify their allegiance to [[individualism]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In 1914, Nock joined the staff of ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'' magazine, which at the time was supportive of liberal capitalism.

A lifelong admirer of Henry George, Nock went on to become co-editor of ''[[The Freeman#Earlier publications called The Freeman|The Freeman]]'' from 1920 to 1924, a publication initially conceived as a vehicle for the single tax movement, financed by the wealthy wife of the magazine's other editor, [[Francis Neilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neilson|first1=Francis|year=1946|title=The Story of 'The Freeman'|url=|journal=The American Journal of Economics and Sociology|volume=6|issue=1|pages=3–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic H.L. Mencken wrote that "[h]is editorials during the three brief years of the ''Freeman'' set a mark that no other man of his trade has ever quite managed to reach. They were well-informed and sometimes even learned, but there was never the slightest trace of pedantry in them".&lt;ref name="Mencken"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mencken|first1=H.L.|year=1926|title=The Immortal Democrat|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1926sep-00123|journal=American Mercury|volume=9|issue=33|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive Vice President of the [[Cato Institute]], [[David Boaz]], writes: "In 1943, at one of the lowest points for liberty and humanity in history, three remarkable women published books that could be said to have given birth to the modern libertarian movement".&lt;ref&gt;Boaz, David (1997). ''The Libertarian Reader: Classic and Contemporary Readings from Lao-Tzu to Milton Friedman''. New York: Free Press. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isabel Paterson]]'s ''[[The God of the Machine]]'', [[Rose Wilder Lane]]'s ''The Discovery of Freedom'' and [[Ayn Rand]]'s ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' each promoted individualism and capitalism. None of the three used the term libertarianism to describe their beliefs and Rand specifically rejected the label, criticizing the burgeoning American libertarian movement as the "hippies of the right".&lt;ref name="ari"&gt;{{cite web|title=What was Ayn Rand's view of the libertarian movement?|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=ar_libertarianism_qa|publisher=Ayn Rand Institute|quote=More specifically, I disapprove of, disagree with and have no connection with, the latest aberration of some conservatives, the so-called "hippies of the right," who attempt to snare the younger or more careless ones of my readers by claiming simultaneously to be followers of my philosophy and advocates of anarchism. [...] libertarians are a monstrous, disgusting bunch of people: they plagiarize my ideas when that fits their purpose, and denounce me in a more vicious manner than any communist publication when that fits their purpose.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's own philosophy, Objectivism, is notedly similar to libertarianism and she accused libertarians of plagiarizing her ideas.&lt;ref name="ari"/&gt; Rand stated: {{quote|All kinds of people today call themselves "libertarians," especially something calling itself the New Right, which consists of hippies who are anarchists instead of leftist collectivists; but anarchists are collectivists. Capitalism is the one system that requires absolute objective law, yet libertarians combine capitalism and anarchism. That's worse than anything the New Left has proposed. It's a mockery of philosophy and ideology. They sling slogans and try to ride on two bandwagons. They want to be hippies, but don't want to preach collectivism because those jobs are already taken. But anarchism is a logical outgrowth of the anti-intellectual side of collectivism. I could deal with a Marxist with a greater chance of reaching some kind of understanding, and with much greater respect. Anarchists are the scum of the intellectual world of the Left, which has given them up. So the Right picks up another leftist discard. That's the libertarian movement.&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, Robert (2005). ''Ayn Rand Answers: The Best of Her Q &amp; A''.  p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard''.

Rothbard was influenced by the work of the 19th-century American individualist anarchists&lt;ref&gt;DeLeon, David (1978). ''[[The American as Anarchist: Reflections on Indigenous Radicalism]]''. [[Johns Hopkins University Press]].  p. 127. "only a few individuals like Murray Rothbard, in ''Power and Market'', and some article writers were influenced by [past anarchists like Spooner and Tucker]. Most had not evolved consciously from this tradition; they had been a rather automatic product of the American environment."&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to meld their advocacy of free markets and private defense with the principles of Austrian economics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1965, 2000).  "[https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View]". ''Journal of Libertarian Studies''. '''20''':1. p. 7. "There is, in the body of thought known as 'Austrian economics,' a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market (and of the consequences of government intervention in that market) which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung [worldview]".&lt;/ref&gt; This new philosophy he called anarcho-capitalism.

[[Karl Hess]], a speechwriter for [[Barry Goldwater]] and primary author of the Republican Party's 1960 and 1964 [[Party platform|platforms]], became disillusioned with traditional politics following the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential campaign]] in which Goldwater lost to [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. He parted with the Republicans altogether after being rejected for employment with the party, and began work as a heavy-duty welder. Hess began reading American anarchists largely due to the recommendations of his friend Murray Rothbard and said that upon reading the works of communist anarchist Emma Goldman, he discovered that anarchists believed everything he had hoped the Republican Party would represent. For Hess, Goldman was the source for the best and most essential theories of [[Ayn Rand]] without any of the "crazy [[solipsism]] that Rand was so fond of".&lt;ref&gt;Fischler, Steven (Director); Sucher, Joel (Director) (1983). ''Anarchism in America'' (DVD). Pacific Street Films. "I was just amazed.  When I read Emma Goldman, it was as though everything I had hoped that the Republican Party would stand for suddenly came out—crystallized—in this magnificently clear statement."&lt;/ref&gt; Hess and Rothbard founded the journal ''[[Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought]]'', which was published from 1965 to 1968, with George Resch and [[Leonard P. Liggio]]. In 1969, they edited ''[[The Libertarian Forum]]'' 1969, which Hess left in 1971.  Hess eventually put his focus on the small scale, stating that "Society is: people together making culture". He deemed two of his cardinal social principles to be "opposition to central political authority" and "concern for people as individuals". His rejection of standard American [[party politics]] was reflected in a lecture he gave during which he said: "The Democrats or liberals think that everybody is stupid and therefore they need somebody... to tell them how to behave themselves. The Republicans think everybody is lazy".&lt;ref&gt;Halle, Roland; Ladue, Peter (1980). ''Karl Hess: Toward Liberty''. Direct Cinema, Ltd. [M16 2824 K].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vietnam War]] split the uneasy alliance between growing numbers of American libertarians and conservatives who believed in limiting liberty to uphold moral virtues. Libertarians opposed to the war joined the [[draft dodger|draft resistance]] and [[peace movement]]s, as well as organizations such as [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS). In 1969 and 1970, Hess joined with others, including Murray Rothbard, [[Robert LeFevre]], [[Dana Rohrabacher]], [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] and former SDS leader [[Carl Oglesby]] to speak at two "left-right" conferences which brought together activists from both the Old Right and the New Left in what was emerging as a nascent libertarian movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bradspangler.com/blog/archives/288|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110708090610/http://bradspangler.com/blog/archives/288|archivedate=8 July 2011|title=Spangler Home Improvement Tips – Smart home improvement decisions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his effort to unite right and left-libertarianism, Hess would join the SDS as well as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), of which he explained: "We used to have a labor movement in this country, until I.W.W. leaders were killed or imprisoned. You could tell labor unions had become captive when business and government began to praise them. They're destroying the militant black leaders the same way now.  If the slaughter continues, before long liberals will be asking, 'What happened to the blacks? Why aren't they militant anymore?'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fare.tunes.org/books/Hess/from_far_right_to_far_left.html ''From Far Right to Far Left– and Farther– With Karl Hess''] by James Boyd: 1970 ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard ultimately broke with the left, allying himself instead with the burgeoning [[paleoconservative]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;See Raimondo 277–78; Doherty 562–565.&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized the tendency of these [[left-libertarian]]s to appeal to "'free spirits,' to people who don't want to push other people around, and who don't want to be pushed around themselves" in contrast to "the bulk of Americans," who "might well be tight-assed conformists, who want to stamp out drugs in their vicinity, kick out people with strange dress habits, etc".&lt;ref&gt;Murray N. Rothbard, letter to David Bergland, 5 June 1986, qtd. Raimondo 263–264. Rothbard emphasized that this was relevant as a matter of strategy: the failure to pitch the libertarian message to Middle America, he wrote, might result in the loss of "the tight-assed majority."&lt;/ref&gt; This left-libertarian tradition has been carried to the present day by Samuel Edward Konkin III's [[agorist]]s, contemporary mutualists such as [[Kevin Carson]] and Roderick T.

In 1971, a small group of Americans led by [[David Nolan (libertarian)|David Nolan]] formed the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]],&lt;ref&gt;Bill Winter, [http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/cp3/message/9701 "1971–2001: The Libertarian Party's 30th Anniversary Year: Remembering the first three decades of America's 'Party of Principle'"]{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} LP News&lt;/ref&gt; which has run a presidential candidate every election year since 1972. Other libertarian organizations, such as the [[Center for Libertarian Studies]] and the Cato Institute, were also formed in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716024031/http://www.isil.org/network/global/C19/ International Society for Individual Liberty Freedom Network list].&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[John Hospers]], a one-time member of Rand's inner circle, proposed a non-initiation of force principle to unite both groups, but this statement later became a required "pledge" for candidates of the Libertarian Party and Hospers became its first presidential candidate in 1972.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In the 1980s, Hess joined the Libertarian Party and served as editor of its newspaper from 1986 to 1990.

Modern libertarianism gained significant recognition in academia with the publication of Harvard University professor [[Robert Nozick]]'s ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' in 1974, for which he received a National Book Award in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;National Book Foundation. "[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1975.html National Book Awards: 1975 – Philosophy and Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909065656/http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1975.html|date=9 September 2011}}"&lt;/ref&gt; In response to [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', Nozick's book supported a [[Night-watchman state|minimal state]] (also called a nightwatchman state by Nozick) on the grounds that the ultraminimal state arises without violating [[individual rights]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, David Lewis (30 April 2008). "[http://www.nysun.com/sports/reconsiderations-robert-nozick-and-coast-utopia Robert Nozick and the Coast of Utopia]". ''[[The New York Sun]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the transition from an ultraminimal state to a minimal state is morally obligated to occur. Specifically, Nozick writes, "We argue that the first transition from a system of private protective agencies to an ultraminimal state, will occur by an invisible-hand process in a morally permissible way that violates no one's rights. Secondly, we argue that the transition from an ultraminimal state to a minimal state morally must occur. It would be morally impermissible for persons to maintain the monopoly in the ultraminimal state without providing protective services for all, even if this requires specific 'redistribution.'  The operators of the ultraminimal state are morally obligated to produce the minimal state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy, State, and Utopia|last=Nozick|first=Robert|publisher=Basic Books|year=2013|isbn= 978-0-465-05100-7|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, Rothbard wrote that "[o]ne gratifying aspect of our rise to some prominence is that, for the first time in my memory, we, 'our side,' had captured a crucial word from the enemy... 'Libertarians'... had long been simply a polite word for left-wing anarchists, that is for anti-private property anarchists, either of the communist or syndicalist variety. But now we had taken it over".&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (2009).  ''The Betrayal of the American Right''. Ludwig von Mises Institute. {{ISBN|1610165012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the project of spreading libertarian ideals in the United States has been so successful that some Americans who don't identify as "libertarian" seem to hold libertarian views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922640625|title=Peak Oil: Apocalyptic Environmentalism and Libertarian Political Culture|last=Schneider-Mayerson|first=Matthew|isbn=9780226285573|location=Chicago|oclc=922640625}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the resurgence of neoliberalism in the 1970s, this modern American libertarianism has spread beyond North America via think tanks and political parties.&lt;ref name="teles2008diffusion"&gt;Teles, Steven; Kenney, Daniel A.

He explains that their pacifism, anarchism, and commitment to the downtrodden were one of the important models and inspirations for the 60s. As Farrell puts it, "Catholic Workers identified the issues of the sixties before the Sixties began, and they offered models of protest long before the protest decade."[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SA/en/display/268 "The Spirit of the Sixties: The Making of Postwar Radicalism" by James J. Farrell].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"While not always formally recognized, much of the protest of the sixties was anarchist. Within the nascent women's movement, anarchist principles became so widespread that a political science professor denounced what she saw as "The Tyranny of Structurelessness." Several groups have called themselves "Amazon Anarchists." After the [[Stonewall Rebellion]], the New York [[Gay Liberation Front]] based their organization in part on a reading of [[Murray Bookchin]]'s anarchist writings."

Anarchism circulated within the movement along with other radical ideologies. The influence of anarchism was strongest among radical feminists, in the commune movement, and probably in the Weather Underground and elsewhere in the violent fringe of the anti-war movement." [http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm "Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement" by Barbara Epstein].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, the International of Anarchist Federations was founded in Carrara, Italy during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of [[Anarchist Federation (France)|France]], the [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana|Italian]] and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the [[Bulgaria]]n federation in French exile.&lt;ref name="Short history of the IAF-IFA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/archives/en/files/l/10760196.php London Federation of Anarchists involvement in Carrara conference, 1968] International Institute of Social History, Accessed 19 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The uprisings of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] also led to a small resurgence of interest in left communist ideas. Various small left communist groups emerged around the world, predominantly in the leading capitalist countries. A series of conferences of the communist left began in 1976, with the aim of promoting international and cross-tendency discussion, but these petered out in the 1980s without having increased the profile of the movement or its unity of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.internationalism.org/ir/122_conferences|title=The International Conferences of the Communist Left (1976–80) &amp;#124; International Communist Current|publisher=En.internationalism.org|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of left communist internationals|Left communist groups existing today]] include the [[International Communist Party]], International Communist Current and the [[Internationalist Communist Tendency]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of [[Commune (intentional community)|communes]] and [[Squatting|squatter]] movements like that of [[Barcelona]], Spain. In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the [[Freetown Christiania]], an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen.

Around the turn of the 21st century, libertarian socialism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.&lt;ref name=rupert&gt;{{cite book|page=66|last=Rupert|first=Mark|title=Globalization and International Political Economy|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham|year=2006|isbn=0-7425-2943-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[G8|Group of Eight]] and the [[World Economic Forum]]. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as [[black bloc]]s and other organizational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity groups]] and the use of decentralized technologies such as the Internet.&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; A significant event of this period was the confrontations at [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; For English anarchist scholar [[Simon Critchley]], "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary [[neo-liberalism]]...One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Simon Critchley#Infinitely Demanding (2007)|Infinitely Demanding]]'' by [[Simon Critchley]]. [[Verso Books|Verso]]. 2007. p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; This might also have been motivated by "the collapse of '[[Real socialism|really existing socialism]]' and the capitulation to [[neo-liberalism]] of Western [[social democracy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Chamsy el- Ojeili. ''Beyond post-socialism. Dialogues with the far-left.'' Palgrave Macmillan. 2015. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian socialists in the early 21st century have been involved in the [[alter-globalization]] movement, squatter movement; [[social centers]]; [[infoshop]]s; anti-poverty groups such as [[Ontario Coalition Against Poverty]] and [[Food Not Bombs]]; [[Leasehold estate|tenants']] unions; [[housing cooperative]]s; [[Intentional community|intentional communities]] generally and [[egalitarian communities]]; anti-sexist organizing; grassroots media initiatives; digital media and computer activism; experiments in [[participatory economics]]; [[anti-racist]] and [[anti-fascist]] groups like [[Anti-Racist Action]] and [[Anti-Fascist Action]]; activist groups protecting the rights of immigrants and promoting the free movement of people, such as the [[No Border network]]; [[worker co-operative]]s, [[countercultural]] and artist groups; and the peace movement.

In the United States, polls (circa 2006) find that the views and voting habits of between 10 and 20 percent (and increasing) of voting age Americans may be classified as "fiscally conservative and socially liberal, or libertarian".&lt;ref name="BoazKirby06"&gt;''The Libertarian Vote'' by David Boaz and David Kirby, Cato Institute, 18 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anes2004"&gt;''The ANES Guide to Public Opinion and Electoral Behavior, 1948–2004'' American National Election Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on pollsters and researchers defining libertarian views as fiscally conservative and socially liberal (based on the common United States meanings of the terms) and against government intervention in economic affairs and for expansion of personal freedoms.&lt;ref name="BoazKirby06"/&gt; Through 20 polls on this topic spanning 13 years, Gallup found that voters who are libertarian on the political spectrum ranged from 17–23% of the United States electorate.&lt;ref name="Gallup2006"&gt;Gallup Poll news release, 7–10 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2014 Pew Poll found that 23% of Americans who identify as libertarians have no idea what the word means.&lt;ref&gt;Kiley, Jocelyn (25 August 2014).

CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark "Trade union membership 1993–2003" (International: SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Other active syndicalist movements include the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]] and the [[Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation]] in Sweden; the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana]] in Italy; [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] in the United States; and [[Solidarity Federation]] in the United Kingdom. The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] claiming 2,000 paying members as well as the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]], also remain active. In the United States, there exists the [[Common Struggle|Common Struggle – Libertarian Communist Federation]].

== Criticism ==
{{main|Criticism of libertarianism}}
[[Criticism of libertarianism]] includes ethical, economic, environmental, pragmatic, and philosophical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;This includes the view that mainstream libertarianism has no explicit theory of liberty. See for instance [https://philpapers.org/rec/INDNLA "New-Paradigm Libertarianism: a Very Brief Explanation"].&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that ''laissez-faire'' capitalism does not necessarily produce the best or most efficient outcome,&lt;ref&gt;[http://evonomics.com/complexity-economics-shows-us-that-laissez-faire-fail-nickhanauer/ "Complexity Economics Shows Us Why Laissez-Faire Economics Always Fails"].&lt;/ref&gt; nor does its philosophy of individualism and policies of deregulation prevent the abuse of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922640625|title=Peak Oil : apocalyptic environmentalism and libertarian political culture|last=Matthew,|first=Schneider-Mayerson,|isbn=9780226285573|location=Chicago|oclc=922640625}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Authenticity of libertarian goals ===
Critics such as [[Corey Robin]] describe right-libertarianism as fundamentally a [[reactionary]] [[Conservatism|conservative]] ideology, united with more traditional conservative thought and goals by a desire to enforce hierarchical power and social relations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Sarah Palin|last=Robin|first=Corey|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=0199793743|location=|pages=15–16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Conservatism, then, is not a commitment to limited government and liberty—or a wariness of change, a belief in evolutionary reform, or a politics of virtue. These may be the byproducts of conservatism, one or more of its historically specific and ever-changing modes of expression. But they are not its animating purpose. Neither is conservatism a makeshift fusion of capitalists, Christians, and warriors, for that fusion is impelled by a more elemental force—the opposition to the liberation of men and women from the fetters of their superiors, particularly in the private sphere. Such a view might seem miles away from the libertarian defense of the free market, with its celebration of the atomistic and autonomous individual. But it is not. When the libertarian looks out upon society, he does not see isolated individuals; he sees private, often hierarchical, groups, where a father governs his family and an owner his employees.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Government decentralization ===
{{further|Decentralization}}
John Donahue argues that if political power were radically shifted to local authorities, parochial local interests would predominate at the expense of the whole and that this would exacerbate current problems with collective action.&lt;ref&gt;Donahue, John. (1 May 1997). [https://web.archive.org/web/20070414205533/http://www.prospect.org/print/V8/32/donahue-j.html "The Devil in Devolution"]. ''American Prospect''.  8 (32).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of real-world examples of libertarianism ===
[[Michael Lind]] has observed that of the 195 countries in the world today, none have fully actualized a libertarian society: {{quote|If libertarianism was a good idea, wouldn't at least one country have tried it?  Wouldn't there be at least one country, out of nearly two hundred, with minimal government, free trade, open borders, decriminalized drugs, no welfare state and no public education system?&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Lind|Lind, Michael]].  (4 June 2013.). [http://www.salon.com/2013/06/04/the_question_libertarians_just_cant_answer "The Question Libertarians Just Can't Answer"]. ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]].''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lind has also criticized libertarianism, particularly the right-wing and free market variant of the ideology, as being incompatible with [[democracy]] and apologetic towards [[autocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/08/30/lind_libertariansim/|title=Why libertarians apologize for autocracy|first=Michael|last=Lind|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, libertarian Warren Redlich argues that the United States "was extremely libertarian from the founding until 1860, and still very libertarian until roughly 1930."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://independentpoliticalreport.com/2017/04/was-america-ever-libertarian/|title=Was America Ever Libertarian?|date=25 April 2017|work=Independent Political Report|access-date=6 October 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Long Mile Cave''', sometimes known locally as '''Pick'ny Mama Cave''' or '''Hell's Gate Cave''', is a [[palaeontology|palaeontological]] and [[paleoanthropology|palaeoanthropological]] site in the [[Cockpit Country]] of north-western [[Jamaica]].

==Description==
The site is a small, largely collapsed, [[limestone]] chamber cave that is now a [[rock shelter]] with a depth of 3&amp;nbsp;m and a length of 6&amp;nbsp;m.  It lies in the [[Trelawny Parish]] close to the Coxheath-Windsor Road on privately owned farmland and is an important [[Quaternary]] palaeontological site as well as containing a [[Taino people|Taino]] [[midden]].&lt;ref&gt;Jamaican Caving Notes.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Extinction|Extinct]] [[fossil]] animals discovered at the site include the [[Jamaican monkey]] (''Xenothrix mcgregori'') and the [[Jamaican flightless ibis]] (''Xenicibis xympithecus''), which were described from material excavated by Harold Anthony in 1919-1920.&lt;ref&gt;Olson &amp; Steadman (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lying in repose''' is the tradition in which the body of a deceased person, often of high social stature, is made available for public [[Viewing (funeral)|viewing]]. Lying in repose differs from the more formal honor of [[lying in state]], which is generally held at the principal government building of the deceased person's country and often accompanied by a [[guard of honour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdw.army.mil/lyinginrepose.htm Lying in Repose/Lying in State] The United States Army {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803035534/http://www.mdw.army.mil/lyinginrepose.htm |date=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the distinction between lying in repose and lying in state is not often observed.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Lying in state is generally considered to be when one's body is placed in the [[United States Capitol rotunda|rotunda of the United States Capitol]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} When the deceased person is placed in another location, like the Great Hall of the [[United States Supreme Court Building|Supreme Court]], they lie in repose, as was the case following the death of Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fandos|first1=Nicholas|title=Scalia to Lie in Repose at Supreme Court, With Funeral on Saturday|url=http://nyti.ms/1R7xsyn|accessdate=17 February 2016|agency=New York Times|date=16 February 2016|quote=Correction: February 17, 2016  A headline with an earlier version of this article incorrectly described how Justice Antonin Scalia’s body will be displayed for public viewing in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court. He will lie in repose; he will not lie in state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of [[President of the United States|presidents]] who die in office generally lie in repose in the [[East Room]] of the [[White House]] while those of a deceased former president generally lie in repose in his home [[U.S. state|state]]. However, as an example to the contrary, when the body of [[John F. Kennedy]] lay in repose, the term meant "private" as opposed to a public lying in state.

The body of [[Babe Ruth]] lay in repose in Yankee Stadium.

The body of singer [[Israel Kamakawiwo'ole]] lay in repose in the state capital building of Hawaii in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adamski|first=Mary|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/1997/07/10/news/story3.html|publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Not everyone eligible to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda does so. For instance, the body of former President [[Richard Nixon]] lay in repose at the [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library]] in [[Yorba Linda, California]], Senator [[Edward Kennedy]]'s body lay in repose at the [[John F. Kennedy Library]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and Senator [[Robert Byrd]]'s body lay in repose in the Senate chamber at the Capitol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsaz.com/special/headlines/97513719.html |title=Schedule for Memorial Services Honoring Senator Robert C. Byrd |date=30 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5quDmhEaW?url=http://www.wsaz.com/special/headlines/97513719.html |archivedate=1 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], when deceased [[Governor General of Canada|governors general]] and [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime ministers]] lie anywhere outside of the [[Centre Block]] of [[Parliament Hill]], they lie in repose{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. In the Hall of Honour, the Senate, or the foyer of the House of Commons, they [[Lying_in_state#Canada|lie in state]].

At the provincial, territorial or local levels, current and former politicians may lie in state or repose in government buildings.

'''Man-eating tree''' can refer to any of the various [[legend]]ary [[carnivorous plant]]s large enough to kill and consume a person or other large animal.

The earliest well-known report of a man-eating tree originated as a literary fabrication written by Edmund Spencer for the ''[[New York World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Spencer |first=Edmund |editor-last=Somers |editor-first=Frederick Maxwell |title=Wonderful Stories: The Man-eating Tree |date=August 1888 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T_ZYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA109 |magazine=Current Literature |volume=1 |number=2| |page=109,154-155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spencer's article first appeared in the daily edition of the ''New York World'' on 26 April 1874, and appeared again in the weekly edition of the newspaper two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York World|accessdate=2013-07-01|title=Crinoida Dajeeana, The Man-eating Tree of Madagascar|author=Spencer, Edmund|date=April 26–28, 1874 |url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2011/New%20York%20NY%20World/New%20York%20NY%20World%201880-1881%20Grayscale/New%20York%20NY%20World%201880-1881%20Grayscale%20-%200070.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, a letter was published by a purported German [[explorer]] named "Karl Leche" (also spelled as Karl or Carl Liche in later accounts), who provided a report of encountering a [[human sacrifice|sacrifice]] performed by the "Mkodo tribe" of [[Madagascar]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2007-10-26|title=The Dirt: Myths about man-eating plants - something to chew on|author=Ron Sullivan and Joe Eaton|date=October 27, 2007|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/27/HOIASVF6T.DTL}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story was picked up by many other newspapers of the day, which included the ''[[South Australian Register]]'' of 27 October 1874,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=South Australian Register|accessdate=2013-07-01|title=Man-eating Tree of Madagascar|author=Spencer, Edmund|date=October 27, 1874|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39810790?searchTerm=man-eating%20tree%20madagascar&amp;searchLimits=l-title=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it gained even greater notoriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/nyregion/answering-a-question-about-a-tale-of-human-sacrifice-to-a-tree.html|title=Answering a Question About a Tale of Human Sacrifice to a Tree|last=Pollak|first=Michael|date=2014-08-15|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the tree, the account related:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The slender delicate palpi, with the fury of starved serpents, quivered a moment over her head, then as if instinct with demoniac intelligence fastened upon her in sudden coils round and round her neck and arms; then while her awful screams and yet more awful laughter rose wildly to be instantly strangled down again into a gurgling moan, the tendrils one after another, like great green serpents, with brutal energy and infernal rapidity, rose, retracted themselves, and wrapped her about in fold after fold, ever tightening with cruel swiftness and savage tenacity of anacondas fastening upon their prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tyson | first =Peter | title =A Forest Full of Frights, part 2 | work =The Wilds of Madagascar | publisher =Nova Online | url =https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/madagascar/surviving/frights2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The tree was given further publicity by ''Madagascar: Land of the Man-eating Tree'', a book by [[Chase Osborn]], who had been a [[Governor of Michigan]]. Osborn claimed that both the tribes and missionaries on Madagascar knew about the hideous tree, repeated the above Liche account, and acknowledged "I do not know whether this tigerish tree really exists or whether the bloodcurdling stories about it are pure myth. It is enough for my purpose if its story focuses your interest upon one of the least known spots of the world."&lt;ref name="Osborn1925"&gt;{{cite book |last=Osborn |first=Chase Salmon |title=Madagascar: Land of the Man-eating Tree |year=1924 |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.89667 |publisher=Republic Publishing Company |location=New York, N.Y. |pages=3-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his 1955 book, ''Salamanders and other Wonders'', science author [[Willy Ley]] determined that the Mkodo tribe, Carl Liche, and the Madagascar man-eating tree all appeared to be fabrications: "The facts are pretty clear by now. Of course the man eating tree does not exist. There is no such tribe."&lt;ref name="Ley1955"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ley|first=Willy|title=Salmanders and Other Wonders: Still More Adventures of a Romantic Naturalist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XukeAAAAMAAJ|year=1955|publisher=Viking Press|pages=178–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yateveo==
In [[J. W. Buel]]'s ''Sea and Land'' (1887),&lt;ref name="Astro1976"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hI4TAAAAYAAJ|title=Literature and the Sea: Proceedings of a Conference Held at the Marine Science Center, Newport, Oregon, May 8, 1976|publisher=Oregon State University, Sea Grant College Program|year=1976|author=Richard Astro}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Yateveo'' plant is described as being native to Africa and [[Central America]], so named for producing a hissing sound similar to the Spanish phrase "ya-te-veo" ([[literal translation|lit.]] "I-see-you"), and having poisonous "spines" that resemble "many huge serpents in an angry discussion, occasionally darting from side to side as if striking at an imaginary foe" which seize and pierce any creature coming within reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buel |first=James William |year=1887 |title=Sea and Land: An Illustrated History of the Wonderful and Curious Things of Nature existing before and since the Deluge |url=https://archive.org/details/sealandillustrat00buel |publisher=Historical Publishing Company |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |pages=475–477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The vampire vine==
[[William Thomas Stead]], editor of ''[[Review of Reviews]],'' published a brief article in October 1891 that discussed a story found ''[[Lucifer (magazine)|Lucifer]]'' magazine, describing a plant in [[Nicaragua]] called by the natives the devil's snare. This plant had the capability "to drain the blood of any living thing which comes within its death-dealing touch." According to the article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Dunstan, naturalist, who has recently returned from Central America, where he spent nearly two years in the study of the flora and the fauna of the country, relates the finding of a singular growth in one of the swamps which surround the great lakes of Nicaragua. He was engaged in hunting for botanical and entomological specimens, when he heard his dog cry out, as if in agony, from a distance. Running to the spot whence the animal's cries came. Mr. Dunstan found him enveloped in a perfect network of what seemed to be a fine rope-like tissue of roots and fibers...  The native servants who accompanied Mr. Dunstan manifested the greatest horror of the vine, which they call "the devil's snare", and were full of stories of its death-dealing powers. He was able to discover very little about the nature of the plant, owing to the difficulty of handling it, for its grasp can only be torn away with the loss of skin and even of flesh; but, as near as Mr. Dunstan could ascertain, its power of suction is contained in a number of infinitesimal mouths or little suckers, which, ordinarily closed, open for the reception of food. If the substance is animal, the blood is drawn off and the carcass or refuse then dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=October 1891 |title=The Vampire Vine |journal=Review of Reviews. |volume=IV |issue=22 |pages=391 |editor=Stead, William |publisher=London: Mobray House |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ch3NPZiYvkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An investigation of Stead's review determined no such article was published in the October issue of ''Lucifer'', and concluded that the story in ''Review of Reviews'' appeared to be a fabrication by the editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 1892 |title=A Cannibal Plant |journal=The Western Druggist. |volume=XIV |issue=3 |pages=93 |publisher=Chicago: G.P.

It includes usage, consumption, creation, and trade of objects as well as the behaviors, norms, and rituals that the objects create or take part in. Some scholars also include other intangible [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] that include sound, smell and events,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Material Culture of Multilingualism|last=Aronin|first=Larissa|last2=Hornsby|first2=Michael|last3=Kiliańska-Przybyło|first3=Grażyna|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319911038|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some even consider language as part of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Material Culture|last=Kieschnick|first=John|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2003|isbn=0691096759|location=Princeton|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly used in archaeological and anthropological studies, specifically focusing on the material evidence that can be attributed to culture in the past or present. It is usually synonymous with artifacts, which humans use to cope with the physical world, facilitate social intercourse, and benefit man's state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Material Culture: Critical Concepts in the Social Sciences, Volume 1, Issue 1|last=Buchli|first=Victor|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0415267196|location=London|pages=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholarly analysis of material culture - the human-made or altered things - is called '''material culture studies.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Material Culture in America: Understanding Everyday Life|last=Sheumaker|first=Helen|last2=Wajda|first2=Shirley|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2008|isbn=9781576076477|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=xi-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[interdisciplinary field]] that tells of the relationships between people and their things: the making, history, preservation, and interpretation of objects. It draws on both theory and practice from the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]] such as [[art history]], [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[historic preservation]], [[folklore]], [[literary criticism]] and [[museum studies]], among others. Anything from buildings and architectural elements to books, jewelry, or toothbrushes can be considered material culture.

== Material value ==

Research in several areas looked into the reasons for perceiving an object with meaning. Common reasons for valuing material lie in their monetary or sentimental value.

A well-known related theory is Kahneman's endowment effect theory. According to Kahneman, people evaluate objects they own with higher value than the same object if they do not own it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|last2=Knetsch|first2=Jack L.|last3=Thaler|first3=Richard H.|date=1991-01-01|title=Anomalies: The Endowment Effect, Loss Aversion, and Status Quo Bias|jstor=1942711|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=5|issue=1|pages=193–206|doi=10.1257/jep.5.1.193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The endowment effect was found to occur as soon as the item is acquired and to increase over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strahilevitz|first=Michal A.|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=1998-12-01|title=The Effect of Ownership History on the Valuation of Objects|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/25/3/276/1795651/The-Effect-of-Ownership-History-on-the-Valuation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=276–289|doi=10.1086/209539|issn=0093-5301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way in which material can hold meaning and value is by carrying communication between people, just like other communication forms such as speech, touch and gesture. An object can mediate messages between time, or space, or both between people who are not together. A work of art, for example, can transfer a message from the creator to the viewer and share an image, a feeling, or an experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Material can contain memories and mutual experiences across time and influence thoughts and feelings. A study found that couples who have more items that were jointly acquired and more favorite items among them had higher-quality relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lohmann|first=Andrew|last2=Arriaga|first2=Ximena B.|last3=Goodfriend|first3=Wind|date=2003-09-01|title=Close relationships and placemaking: Do objects in a couple's home reflect couplehood?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6811.00058/abstract|journal=Personal Relationships|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=437–450|doi=10.1111/1475-6811.00058|issn=1475-6811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from the fields of sociology, psychology, and anthropology have also been fascinated by gift-giving, a universal phenomenon that holds emotional meaning using material culture. According to Schieffelin, "gift-giving is a vehicle of social obligation and political maneuver."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schieffelin|first=Edward L.|date=1980-01-01|title=Reciprocity and the Construction of Reality|jstor=2801347|journal=Man|volume=15|issue=3|pages=502–517|doi=10.2307/2801347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mauss defines the gift as creating a special bond between the giver and the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KNvxPSAYzbQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=the+gift+the+form&amp;ots=FXvgTLvKWT&amp;sig=TUMOcc7zIOAjDfDs9YcjcuksGHQ#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20gift%20the%20form&amp;f=false|title=The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies|last=Mauss|first=Marcel|date=2000-01-01|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=9780393320435|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mauss, the giver never really leaves the gift but becomes part of the receiver's future by inserting the gift into their life. A gift leads at some point to another gift in response, which creates a special reciprocal bond between people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==
Material culture studies as an academic field grew along the field of [[anthropology]] and so began by studying non-Western material culture. All too often, it was a way of putting material culture into categories in such a way that marginalized and hierarchized the cultures from which they came.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=Ian|title=Understanding Material Culture|year=2007|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|location=New York, New York|isbn=0761942262}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the "golden age" of [[museum]]-going, material cultures were used to show the supposed evolution of society from the simple objects of non-Westerners to the advanced objects of Europeans. It was a way of showing that Europeans were at the end of the evolution of society, with non-Westerners at the beginning. Eventually, scholars left the notion that culture evolved though predictable cycles, and the study of material culture changed to have a more objective view of non-Western material culture.

The origins of the field of material culture studies as its own distinct discipline dates back to the 1990s. The ''[[Journal of Material Culture]]'' started putting out publications only in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woodward|first=Sophie|title=Material Culture|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0085.xml|publisher=Oxford|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a sense that can be thought of as younger for tying closely to ethnographic work and collecting habits. [[Collecting]] habits date back to hundreds of years ago.

[[Leslie White]] was an American anthropologist, known for his advocacy of theories of [[cultural evolution]], [[sociocultural evolution]], and especially [[neoevolutionism]] and for his role in creating the department of anthropology at the [[University of Michigan]] Ann Arbor. He was president of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (1964). He wrote ''The Science of Culture'' in 1949 in which he outlined schema of the world as divided into cultural, biological, and physical levels of phenomenon. White believed that the development of culture rested primarily on technology and that the history of human technology could be understood through the study of human-produced materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=American%20Materialism] American Materialism&lt;/ref&gt;

American anthropologist [[James Deetz]], known for his work in the field of [[historical archaeology]], wrote the book "In Small Things Forgotten" in 1977 and published a revised and expanded version in 1996. He pioneered there the ideas of using neglected substances such as trash pits, potshards, and soil stains to reveal human actions. By analyzing objects in association with their location, the history of that location, the objects they were found with, and not singling out the most valuable or rarest ones, archaeologists can create a more accurate picture of daily life. Deetz looks at the long view of history and investigates the impact of European culture on other cultures across the globe by an analysis of the spread of everyday objects.

Ian M. G. Quimby's ''Material Culture and the Study of American Life'', written in 1978, tried to bridge the gaps between the museum world and the university and between curator and historian. Quimby posits that objects in museums are understood through an intellectual framework that uses non-traditional sources. He also describes the benefits of work on exhibit design as a vehicle for education.

Thomas Schlereth, Professor Emeritus of American Studies at the [[University of Notre Dame]], wrote about philosophies and methods of teaching history outside the traditional classroom. In his book ''Artifacts and the American Past'', Schlereth defines material culture study as an attempt to explain why things were made, why they took the forms they did, and what social, functional, aesthetic, or symbolic needs they serve. He advocates studying photographs, catalogues, maps and landscapes. He suggests a variety of modes for interrogating artifacts.

[[Archaeology]] is the study of humanity through the inferential analysis of material culture to ultimately gain an understanding of the daily lives of past cultures and the overarching trend of human history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Arthur Asa|title=What Objects Mean: An Introduction of Material Culture|year=2009|publisher=Left Coast Press Inc.|location=Walnut Creek, CA|isbn=9781598744118|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[archaeological culture]] is a recurring [[assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]] of the [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s from a specific time and place, most often that has no written record. These physical artifacts are then used to make inferences about the ephemeral aspects of culture and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice |edition=4th |last=Renfrew |first=Colin |last2=Bahn |first2=Paul |year=2004 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London |isbn=0-500-28441-5 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kris Hurst|first=K|title=Material Culture|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/mterms/g/material_cultur.htm|work=About.com : Archaeology|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more recent societies, written histories, oral traditions, and direct observations may also be available to supplement the study of material culture.

Beginning in the European [[Renaissance]] and the culture's fascination with classical antiquities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fagan|first=Brian M.|title=Archaeology|year=1997|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0673525252|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the study of artifacts from long-lost cultures has produced many forms of [[archaeological theory]], such as [[trans-cultural diffusion]], [[processual archaeology]], and [[post-processual archaeology]]. Additionally, archaeological sub-disciplines have emerged within the field, including [[prehistoric archaeology]], [[classical archaeology]], [[historical archaeology]], [[cognitive archaeology]], and [[cultural ecology]]. Recently, a scientific methodology and approach to the analysis of pre-historic material culture has become prevalent with systematic excavation techniques producing detailed and precise results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fagan|first=Brian M.|title=Archaeology|year=1997|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0673525252|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropology==

[[Anthropology]] is most simply defined as the study of humans across time and space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Anthropological Association|title=What is Anthropology?|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In studying a human culture, an anthropologist studies the material culture of the people in question as well as the people themselves and their interactions with others. To understand the culture in which an object is featured, an anthropologist looks at the object itself, its context, and the way that it was manufactured and used.

The first anthropologist interested in studying material culture was [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], in the mid-19th century. He is most known for his research on [[kinship]] and social structures, but he also studied the effect of material culture, specifically technology, on the evolution of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Lewis Henry|title=Ancient Society|year=1877|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/morgan-lewis/ancient-society/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 19th century, [[Franz Boas]] brought the fields of anthropology and material culture studies closer together. He believed that it was crucial for an anthropologist to analyze not only the physical properties of material culture but also its meanings and uses in its indigenous context to begin to understand a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boas|first=Franz|title=The Limitations of the Comparative Method of Anthropology|year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boas|first=Franz|title=The Methods of Ethnology|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time in France, [[Émile Durkheim]] wrote about the importance of material culture in understanding a society. Durkheim saw material culture as one of the [[social facts]] that functions as a coercive force to maintain [[solidarity]] in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durkheim|first=Emile|title=The Rules of Sociological Method|year=1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], in the 20th century, included the study of material culture in his work as an anthropologist because he believed that it could reveal a deeper level of structure and meaning unattainable by typical [[fieldwork]]. According to Lévi-Strauss, material culture can recall the mindset of a people, regardless of intervening time or space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi-Strauss|first=Claude|title=Structural Anthropology|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 20th century, [[Mary Douglas]] thought that anthropology was about studying the meaning of material culture to the people who experience it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Mary|title=Purity and Danger|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marvin Harris]], a contemporary of Douglas, put forward the theory of [[cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]] and said that all aspects of society have material causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Marvin|title=Cultural Materialism|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==

In archaeology, the idea that social relations are embodied in material is well known and established, with extensive research on exchange, gift giving and objects as part of social ceremonies and events. However, in contradiction to archaeology, where scientists build on material remains of previous cultures, sociology tends to overlook the importance of material in understanding relationships and human social behavior.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=BUPlAAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=material+culture+in+the+social+world&amp;ots=OfvHscrlHt&amp;sig=2pdpOqR1MmCBqyRwLgx5WrbNd0s#v=onepage&amp;q=material%20culture%20in%20the%20social%20world&amp;f=false|title=Material Culture In The Social World|last=Tim|first=Dant|date=1999-08-01|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=9780335198214|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social aspects in material culture include the social behavior around it: the way that the material is used, shared, talked about, or made.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An object cannot hold meaning in and of itself and so when one focuses on the social aspects of material culture, it is critical to keep in mind that interpretations of objects and of interactions with them are the ones to evoke importance and meaning.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=noXhAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=love+objects+material+culture&amp;ots=l5m77l0Voh&amp;sig=TuC02c1Q-X9U3z0WS2sajuCK5pY#v=onepage&amp;q=love%20objects%20material%20culture&amp;f=false|title=Love Objects: Emotion, Design and Material Culture|last=Moran|first=Anna|last2=O'Brien|first2=Sorcha|date=2014-08-28|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781472517180|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritage industry==

Museums and other material culture repositories, by their very nature, are often active participants in the [[heritage industry]].  Defined as "the business of managing places that are important to an area's history and encouraging people to visit them," the heritage industry relies heavily on material culture and objects to interpret cultural heritage. The industry is fueled by a cycle of people visiting museums, historic sites, and collections to interact with ideas or physical objects of the past. In turn, the institutions profit through monetary donations or admission fees as well as the publicity that comes with word-of-mouth communications.

That relationship is controversial, as many believe that the heritage industry corrupts the meaning and importance of cultural objects. Often, scholars in the [[humanities]] take a critical view of the heritage industry, particularly heritage tourism, believing it to be a vulgar oversimplification and corruption of historic fact and importance. Others believe that the relationship and the financial stability it brings is often the element that allows [[curators]], researchers, and directors to conserve material culture's legacy.

==Current production==
Some observers advocate intentionally altering the material cultures created by current civilizations. For example, [[waste reduction]] advocates within [[environmentalism]] advocate [[design education|teaching design]] approaches, such as [[cradle-to-cradle design]] and [[appropriate technology]]. [[Anti-consumerism]] advocates encourage consuming less (thus creating fewer artifacts), engaging in more [[do-it-yourself]] projects and [[self-sufficiency]] (changing the quality of artifacts produced), and [[localism (politics)|localism]] impacts the geographic distribution and uniformity of artifacts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">In [[Social Science]], '''Methodological Nationalism''' is a term used to describe  an intellectual orientation and pattern in scholarly research that conceives of the nation-state as the sole unit of analysis or as a container for social processes. This term has been greatly developed by Andreas Wimmer and Nina Glick Schiller, who specifically define '''methodological nationalism''' as "understood as the assumption that the nation/state/society is the natural social and political form of the modern world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wimmer|first1=Andreas|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|title=Methodological nationalism and beyond: nation-state building, migration and the social sciences|journal=Global Networks 2|volume=2|issue=4|pages=301–334|url=http://www.suz.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:1296e4ec-3ca6-4efe-b083-163b9b649bab/Text_13.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodological Nationalism has been identified in many social science subfields, such as [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and the interdisciplinary field of [[migration studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wimmer|first1=Andreas|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|title=Methodological Nationalism, the Social Sciences, and the Study of Migration: An Essay in Historical Epistemology|journal=The International Migration Review|date=2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=576–610|jstor=30037750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodological Nationalism, as a practice within Social Science, has been further critiqued by scholars such as [[Saskia Sassen]], who contends that the nation-state and its borders are an insufficient unit of analysis and that the national is at times the "terrains of the global".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sassen|first1=Saskia|title=The global inside the national A research agenda for sociology|url=http://www.saskiasassen.com/pdfs/publications/the-global-inside-the-national.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three types of methodological nationalism ==

Per Andreas Wimmer and Nina Glick Schiller, there are three types of methodological nationalism in social science scholarship: ignoring or disregarding the importance of nationalism for modern societies, naturalization, and confining studies to geopolitical boundaries of a particular nation-state. These types may co-occur or occur separately. When they co-occur, they may reinforce each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wimmer|first1=Andreas|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|title=Methodological Nationalism, the Social Sciences, and the Study of Migration: An Essay in Historical Epistemology|journal=The International Migration Review|date=2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=576–610|jstor=30037750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodological Nationalism and Migration Studies ==

'''Methodological Nationalism''' and its conception of nation-states has been a component of both contemporary and historical methodologies in migration studies, insofar as certain studies have adhered to it or diverged from its theoretical foundations. This adherence has been acknowledged or otherwise criticized  in numerous studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayall|first1=James|title=Nationalism and international society|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=978-0521389617|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Anthony D.|title=Nationalism and modernism : a critical survey of recent theories of nations and nationalism|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415063418|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the historical prevalence of '''methodological nationalism''' within social science has been explored by scholarship which argues that many turn-of-the-century writings on globalization have  "conflated the necessary
conceptual critique of methodological nationalism with the empirical claim of the
nation-state’s diminishing relevance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chernilo|first1=Daniel|title=The critique of methodological nationalism|journal=Thesis Eleven|date=August 2011|volume=106|issue=1|pages=98–117|doi=10.1177/0725513611415789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, research on  [[transnationalism]] and [[transmigrants]] has contemporary examples of divergence and criticism of '''methodological nationalism''' as an enduring practice in scholarship. Recent studies in transnationalism have conceived of the nation-state as one agent in a complex relationship with many global actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quayson|first1=Ato|last2=Daswani|first2=Girish|title=A Companion to Diaspora and Transnationalism|date=September 2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-8826-5|pages=600|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-140518826X.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migration Studies that conceive of society as extending beyond national boundaries, then, sever this link between nation-state and society.

Research on transnational Latina motherhood has negotiated issues of the nation-state as well as transnationalism. The conceptual frameworks of power geometries, social location, and geographic scales is positiojed to counteract the analytical tendency to fall back on methodological nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pessar |first= Patricia |title= Transnational Migration: Bringing Gender in |date=June 1971 |publisher= Center for Migration Studies of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boehm |first=Deborah |title="For My Children:" Constructing Family and Navigating the State in the U.S.-MexicoTransnation |date=Fall 2003 |publisher= George Washington University for Ethnographic Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholarly research has combined transnational migration studies and conceptual frameworks such as [[coloniality of power]] to avoid '''methodological nationalism''' and better account for the intersecting transnational phenomena that constitutes the experiences of [[transmigrants]] and better explains the processes of transnational migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= Cervantes-Rodríguez, Margarita |last2=Grosfoguel,|first2=Ramón |last=Mielants |first=Eric |title=Caribbean migration to Western Europe and the United States essays on incorporation, identity, and citizenship|date=2009|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781592139569}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patel|first1=Sujata|title=Colonial Modernity and Methodological Nationalism in Sociology of India |website= vimeo.com/34815428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''music of [[New Caledonia]]''' is rooted in the [[Melanesia]]n tradition. The [[Pacific Tempo]] is an important [[music festival]], held every three years in [England]; the biennial [[equinox]] is also an important celebration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/pacific/new_caledonia/printable.htm lonelyplanet.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050318042424/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/pacific/new_caledonia/printable.htm |date=2005-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern popular performers include [[OK! Ryos]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldmusiccentral.org/artists/artist_page.php?id=1409 worldmusiccentral.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edou]] and [[Gurejele]], who are at the forefront of the popular [[Kanak people|Kaneka]] movement, which began in the mid-1980s.  Kaneka fuses traditional styles with [[pop music|pop]] and [[world music]].  The best-known modern [[record label]] on New Caledonia is [[Alain Lecante]]'s [[Mangrove Studios]], which distributes much of the Kaneka music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambafrance-us.org/publi/nff/0211/reg.htm ambafrance-us.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414165735/http://www.ambafrance-us.org/publi/nff/0211/reg.htm |date=2005-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Navarth''', generally referred to as 'the mad poet', is a character in ''[[The Palace of Love]]'' (pub. 1967), the third of the ''[[Demon Princes]]'' novels by [[Jack Vance]], though his writings are occasionally referred to in other, unrelated novels by Vance (e.g. ''[[Araminta Station]]''). Navarth in person appears more eccentric than mad, a [[Salvador Dalí]]-ish petulant extrovert and creator of 'happenings', one of the more amiable in a long line of Vance's self-absorbed egotists. We first encounter him on Earth, old and forgotten, living in reduced circumstances on a canal-boat in the ancient (but fictitious) city of Rollingshaven: apparently a Vanceian conflation of [[Rotterdam]], [[Antwerp]] and [[Hamburg]]. The chief protagonist of the [[novel sequence]], [[Kirth Gersen]], induces Navarth to help him in his quest to find the galactic master criminal Viole Falushe (with whom Navarth was long ago involved when the criminal was merely the schoolboy Vogel Filschner), and the pair eventually travel through space to Falushe’s notorious Palace of Love in the far Beyond.

Navarth published a volume of poetry called ''Pullulations'' (cited in ''[[Throy]]'', Chapter 6); another (presumably posthumous) volume in circulation was ''The Lyrics of Mad Navarth'' (cited in ''Araminta Station'', Chapter 9). The most extended example of his verse that is presented to the reader, the bouncily sinister ballad 'Tim R. Mortiss', appears as an epigraph to Chapter 5 of ''The Palace of Love'' and is a rather fetching absurdist reworking of the 'Lament for the Makars' by the 15th-century Scottish poet [[William Dunbar]]. Other complete poems quoted are ‘The Girl I met in Eridu’ (''POL'' Chapter 7) and ‘Avis rara, black mascara’ (''POL'' Ch.12). Some titles of other poems are given in ''POL'' Ch.7: ‘A Growl for Gruel’, ‘The Juices I have Tramped’, ‘I am a Darting Minstrel’, ‘They Pass!’, ‘Drusilla’s Dream’, and ‘Castles in the Clouds and the Anxieties of Those Who Live Directly Below by Reason of Falling Objects and Wastes’.

A sample of his verse:

:This dainty tray of cloisonné
:Contains my finest patchouli.
:Aha, my dear! What have we here?
:A dead mouse in the potpourri.
(from Navarth, ‘Avis rara, black mascara’)

According to ''[[The Book of Dreams]]'', Chapter 19, one Carol Lewis (the reference is obvious) wrote a book of ''Chronicles of Navarth'', from which two anecdotes are quoted.

The '''''New Harp of Columbia''''' is a seven-shape [[shape note]] tune book first published in 1867 in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] by [[Marcus Lafayette Swan]]. A successor to ''The Harp of Columbia'' published by Swan and his father, W.H. Swan, in 1848,&lt;ref name=cmor&gt;''An Encyclopedia of East Tennessee'' (Oak Ridge, Tenn.: Children's Museum of Oak Ridge, 1981), pp. 366-367.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New Harp'' includes a mixture of hymn tunes, folk hymns, fuguing pieces, and anthems, along with several of Swan's original compositions.&lt;ref name=horn1&gt;Dorothy Horn, "The New Harp of Columbia and Its Music in the Singing-School Tradition," Introduction to the 1978 reprinting of ''The New Harp of Columbia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1978), pp. vii-xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;  The book maintains popularity in [[East Tennessee]],&lt;ref name=cmor /&gt; with about 20 singings in 2004.

==Publication background==

Marcus Lafayette Swan was born in Knoxville in 1827, the son of prominent lawyer William H. Swan, Jr. (1798&amp;ndash;1859).&lt;ref name=petersen&gt;Ron Petersen and Candra Phillips, "East Tennessee Harp Singing," Introduction to the 1978 reprinting of ''The New Harp of Columbia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1978), pp. xviii-xxx.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pardon&gt;Elizabeth Dunham, [http://dlc.lib.utk.edu/f/fa/fulltext/0056.html Finding Aid for the Hannah W.

''The New Harp of Columbia'' has been reprinted numerous times since its initial publication.

The ''New Harp of Columbia'' contains a unique seven-shape system devised by the Swans, which differs from the "standard" seven-shape notation developed by songmaster [[Jesse B.

Marcus Swan kept much of the material from ''The Harp of Columbia'', but also included several tunes by popular hymn composer [[Lowell Mason]] and several of his own compositions.&lt;ref name=cmor /&gt;  A 2001 "Restored Edition" of ''The New Harp'' adds a section of 39 pages of tunes from the 1848 ''Harp of Columbia'' which were not included in the original ''New Harp of Columbia''.

The songs in ''The New Harp'' come from both European (especially English and Scottish) and American singing traditions.&lt;ref name=horn1 /&gt;  Along with Swan's compositions, ''The New Harp'' includes songs such as "Coronation" by [[Oliver Holden]], "Easter Anthem" and "Rose of Sharon" by [[William Billings]], "Creation" by [[Nehemiah Shumway]], "Arlington" by [[Thomas Arne]], and "Duke Street" by [[John Liptrot Hatton|John Hatton]].&lt;ref name=horn1 /&gt;  The book also includes a number of folk hymns, such as "Promised Land," "Idumea," and "Golden Hill."&lt;ref name=horn1 /&gt;  Several tunes were derived from European folk songs, such as "Hamburg" (derived from "[[Auld Lang Syne]]"), "Bruce's Address" (from "[[Scots Wha Hae]]"), and "Marston" (from "[[Farmer in the Dell]]").&lt;ref name=horn1 /&gt;

The '''origin of the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty]]''' has been a controversial topic and has been debated over the past decades by historians. The differing opinions mostly revolve around issues such as the home of the earliest ancestors of the medieval Rashtrakutas, a possible southern migration during the early part of the first millennium and the relationship between the several Rashtrakuta dynasties that ruled small kingdoms in northern and central India and the Deccan in the 6th century - 7th century. Further, the relationship of these medieval Rashtrakutas to the most important and famous dynasty, the Rashtrakutas of [[Manyakheta]] of the 8th century - 10th century time period has also been debated. Also contested is whether the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta were related by ancestry to the early [[Kannada]], [[Maratha]], [[Rajput]], [[Reddi]] or [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] communities of the Deccan and northern India.

While the history of the early Rashtrakutas has caused much debate, the history of the Rashtrakutas of [[Manyakheta]] (in present-day [[Gulbarga]]) of the 8th–10th centuries can be accurately constructed because numerous contemporaneous inscriptions and texts refer to them. The crux of the Manyakheta empire extended from the [[Kaveri river]] in the south to the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] in the north.  At their peak they were the only south Indian empire that conquered regions in far northern India ([[Kannauj]]) as well as the extreme south ([[Ancient Tamil country|Tamilakam]]). The Lata branch of the empire (in present-day [[Gujarat]]) was an important dynasty belonging to the Manyakheta family line which later merged with the Manyakheta kingdom during the 9th century.

==Research==

===Sources===
The study of the history of the early Rashtrakutas and the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta has been made possible by the availability of numerous inscriptions spread all over the Deccan, ancient literature in [[Pali]],&lt;ref name="pali"&gt;[[Bisheshwar Nath Reu|Reu]] 1933 p1&lt;/ref&gt; contemporaneous Kannada literature such as ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'' (850) and ''[[Vikramarjuna Vijaya]]'' (941), Sanskrit writings by Somadeva, Rajashekara, Gunabhadra, Jinasena and others and the notes of Arab travellers of those times such as Suleiman, Ibn Haukal, Al Masudi, Al Istakhri and others.&lt;ref name="improbable1"&gt;Kamath (2001), p72&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have left no topic unstudied in an effort to accurately propose the history of the Rashtrakutas. Theories about their lineage (''Surya Vamsa'' or ''Chandra Vamsa''), native region and ancestral home have been proposed using clues from inscriptions, royal emblems, ancient clan names such as "Rashtrika", epithets such as ''Ratta'', ''Rashtrakuta'', ''Lattalura Puravaradhiswara'', names of royalty, coins and contemporaneous literature.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;Reu (1933) pp1-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="study1"&gt;Kamath (2001), p72-74&lt;/ref&gt; These theories from noted scholars have resulted in claims that the Rashtrakutas were from either [[Rajput]],&lt;ref name="raj"&gt;[[John Faithfull Fleet|J. F. Fleet]] (author of ''Dynasties of Canarese Districts of Bombay Presidency'', 1896) in Reu 1933, p6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kannadiga]],&lt;ref name="kann"&gt;A.S. Altekar (1934), pp21-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kann1"&gt;S.U. Kamath in Kamath 2001, p72-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dal1"&gt;Dalby (1998), p300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ravi1"&gt;Chopra, Ravindran, Subrahmanian (2003), p87&lt;/ref&gt;[[Reddi]],&lt;ref name="red"&gt;A.C. Burnell in Reu 1933, p4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maratha]],&lt;ref name="mar"&gt;C.V. Vaidya (author of ''History of Mediaeval Hindu India : Being a History of India from 600 to 1200 AD'') and D.R.Bhandarkar in Reu 1933, p1, p7&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]&lt;ref name="pun"&gt;Hultzsch and Reu in (Reu 1933, p2, p4)&lt;/ref&gt; origin.

===Epithets===

The appearance of the terms ''Rathika'', ''Ristika'' (''Rashtrika'') or ''Lathika'' in conjunction with the terms ''Kambhoja'' and ''Gandhara'' in some Ashokan inscriptions of the 2nd century BCE from Mansera and Shahbazgarhi in North Western Frontier Province (present day Pakistan), Girnar ([[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]]) and Dhavali ([[Orissa, India|Kalinga]]) and the use of the epithet "Ratta" in many later inscriptions has prompted a claim that the earliest Rashtrakutas were descendants of the ''Arattas'', natives of the Punjab region from the time of [[Mahabharata]] who later migrated south and set up kingdoms there,&lt;ref name="arattas"&gt;Hultzsch in Reu 1933, p2&lt;/ref&gt; while another theory points more generally to north western regions of India.&lt;ref name="nw"&gt;J.H.Fleet in (Reu 1933, p6)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this theory, the Arattas may have become natives of the Deccan having arrived there during the early centuries of the first millennium.&lt;ref name="natives"&gt;Reu (1933), p7&lt;/ref&gt;

This is counter to the argument by other scholars that the term ''Rishtika'' used together with ''Petenika'' in the Ashokan inscriptions implied they were hereditary ruling clans from modern Maharashtra region&lt;ref name="petenika"&gt;D.R.Bhandarkar in Reu 1933, p1, p7&lt;/ref&gt; and the term "Ratta" implied ''Maharatta'' ruling families from modern Maharashtra region.&lt;ref name="maharatta"&gt;C.V.Vaidya in Reu 1933, p1, p7&lt;/ref&gt; But this has been rejected on the basis that from ancient books such as ''Dipavamsha'' and ''Mahavamsha'' in Pali language it is known the term ''Maharatta'' and not ''Rashtrika'' has been used to signify hereditary ruling clans from modern Maharashtra region and the terms ''Rashtrika'' and ''Petenika'' appear to be two different displaced ruling tribes.&lt;ref name="pali1"&gt;B.N. Reu claims Dr C.V. Vaidya has made an assumption that the Rashtrakutas have lived in the Maharashtra region from the time of King Ashoka simply based on availability of Ashokan inscriptions from that region while inscriptions from other parts of the empire such as Saurashtra, Kalinga and North West also use such clan names. He has further argued that ''Rashtrika'' and ''Petenika'' are not one term but two separate terms in (Reu 1933, p1, p7)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is noted by another scholar that ruling clans called ''Rathis'' and ''Maharathis'' were in power in parts of present-day Karnataka as well in the early centuries of the Christian era, which is known inscriptions from the region and further proven by the discovery of lead coins from the middle of 3rd century bearing ''Sadakana Kalalaya Maharathi'' in the heart of modern Karnataka region near [[Chitradurga]]. In the face of these facts it is claimed it can no longer be maintained that the ''Rathi'' and ''Maharathi'' families were confined only to present day Maharashtra.&lt;ref name="rathi"&gt;Altekar (1934), pp20-21&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed there is sufficient inscriptional evidence that several ''Maharathi'' families were related to [[Kannadiga]] families by marriage and they were [[Snake|naga]]  worshippers, a form of worship very popular in the Mysore region (modern Karnataka).&lt;ref name="rathi"/&gt; Also, no evidence to confirm that these families were either Aryan or non-Aryan is available.&lt;ref name="aryan"&gt;Altekar (1934), p25&lt;/ref&gt;

The epithet ''Ratta'', it is also claimed is a Kannada word from which the word ''Rashtrakuta'' has been derived. The use of the word ''Rattagudlu'' (meaning an office) has been found in inscriptions from present day Andhra Pradesh dated prior to the 8th century indicating it was a South Indian word. From the Deoli plates and Karhad records it is argued there was a prince called Ratta and his son was called Rashtrakuta. Hence it has been argued the Rashtrakutas were of Kannada origin.&lt;ref name="rattagudlu"&gt;A.S. Altekar in Kamath 2001, p73&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said the term  ''Rashtra'' means "kingdom" and ''Kuta'' means "lofty"&lt;ref name="kuta"&gt;Reu (1933), p4&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Rashtra'' means province and ''Kuta'' means chieftain.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Another epithet used in inscriptions of [[Amoghavarsha I]] was ''Lattalura Puravaradhiswara''. It is proposed that it refers to their original home ''Lattalur'', modern day Latur in Maharashtra state, bordering Karnataka.&lt;ref name="Fleet"&gt;J.H. Fleet in Kamath 2001, p72&lt;/ref&gt; This area it is claimed was predominantly Kannada speaking based on surviving vestiges of place names, inscriptions and cultural relics. It is explained that  ''Latta'' is a Prakrit variation of ''Ratta'' and hence Rattana-ur became Lattana-ur and finally Lattalur.&lt;ref name="fleet2"&gt;Altekar (1934), p23-24&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that Latalurapura is modern day Ratnapur in Bilaspur district of central India.&lt;ref name="bilas"&gt;According to Rajvade in Reu 1933, p7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal names and signatures===
In linking possible connections between the medieval Rashtrakuta families to the imperial family of Manyakheta it has been pointed out that only the family members ruling from Elichpur ([[Berar Sultanate|Berar]] or modern [[Amravati district]], modern Maharashtra) had names that were very similar to the names of Kings of the Manyakheta dynasty. From the Tivarkhed and Multhai inscriptions it is clear that the kings of this family were Durgaraja, Govindaraja, Svamikaraja and Nannaraja. These names closely resemble the names of Manyakheta kings or their extended family, the name Govindaraja appearing multiple times among the Manyakheta line. These names also appear in the Gujarat line of Rashtrakutas whose family ties with the Manyakheta family is well known.&lt;ref name="names"&gt;Altekar (1934), p8&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted that princes and princesses of the Rashtrakuta family used pure Kannada names such as Kambarasa, Asagavve, Revakka and Abbalabbe as their personal names indicating that they were native [[Kannadigas]]. It has been pointed out that princesses of family lineage belonging to Gujarat signed their royal edicts in Kannada even in their Sanskrit inscriptions. Some examples of this are the Navsari and Baroda plates of Karka I and the Baroda plates of his son Dhruva II. It has been attested by a scholar that the Gujarat Rashtrakuta princes signed their inscriptions in the language of their native home and the race they belonged to.&lt;ref name="sign"&gt;D.R. Bhandarkar in Kamath 2001, p73&lt;/ref&gt; It is well known that the Gujarat line of Rashtrakutas were from the same family as the Manyakheta line. It is argued that if the Rashtrakutas were originally a Marathi speaking family, then the Gujarat Rashtrakutas would not have signed their inscriptions in Kannada language and that too in far away Gujarat.&lt;ref name="guj"&gt;Altekar (1934), p21&lt;/ref&gt; The theory that under the rule of the [[Badami]] [[Chalukyas]] of Kannada country, Kannada speaking dynasties were established in the far corners of the Chalukyan empire in Gujarat, Andhra and [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]] (present day [[Vidharba]] region in modern Maharashtra) and hence the ancestors of King [[Dantidurga]], the founder of the Manyakheta empire were Kannadigas. It is further claimed there is proof that in the locality where Dantidurga lived Kannada was the spoken language.&lt;ref name="home"&gt;Just as the later Maratha ruling families of Baroda, Indore, and Gwallior used their native language Marathi and script in their personal matters, so did the medieval Rashtrakutas preserve their native language Kannada when ruling from Berar- A.S. Altekar (1934), p22, p24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emblems===
Several Rashtrakuta families ruled India during the 6th century - 7th century period. Scholars have tried to understand their relationship with the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta by a comparative study of the emblems.

The only Rashtrakuta family whose royal emblem is similar to that of the rulers of Manyakheta, the golden eagle or [[Garuda]] ''lanchhana'' (emblem) is that of the family that ruled from Amravathi district of modern [[Maharashtra]].  It has been theorised that this line may possibly have been ancestors of the Manyakheta kings. Their inscriptions (Tivarkhed and Multhai) were issued from Achalapura (modern Elichpur) which may have been their capital. Another Rashtrakuta family ruling from Manapura with its founder King Abhimanyu had the emblem of a lion. This makes it improbable that they were the ancestors of the Manyakheta family.&lt;ref name="improbable1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="improbable"&gt;Altekar  (1934), p6&lt;/ref&gt; The location of Manapura is uncertain. [[John Faithfull Fleet]] proposed its identification with [[Manpur, Indore|Manpur in Malwa]], and then with [[Manpur, Umaria|Manpur near Bandhavgarh]], but later rejected both these theories himself.&lt;ref&gt;Epigraphia Indica (Volume 37, Part 1 - Page 12)&lt;/ref&gt; Bhagawanlal Indraji identified it with Manyakheta (Malkhed) itself. [[Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi]] identified it with [[Maan, Maharashtra|Man, Satara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sueiThBrP4gC&amp;dq=manapura&amp;pg=PA32 |title=Kālidāsa; Date, Life, and Works |author1=Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi  |author2=Narayan Raghunath Navlekar  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Popular |year=1969 |isbn=9788171544684 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Garuda is normally indicative Vaishnavite leanings, it has to be observed here that earlier coins belonging to King [[Krishna I]]'s period use the legend ''Parama Maheshwara'', which in turn indicate staunch Shaivite leanings.  This change in symbology has been used to theorise that the Rashtrakutas may have originally been Shaivites and embraced Vaishnavism later.&lt;ref name="shaiva"&gt;The emblem changed from Lion to Garuda later (Reu 1933, p14)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vamsha (genealogy)===
With regards to their ''vamsha'' (whether they belonged to ''Surya Vamsha'' (solar lineage) or ''Chandra Vamsha'' (lunar lineage), Rashtrakuta inscriptions remained silent on the issue,  until about 860. Some 75 inscriptions have been found thereafter in the Deccan and Gujarat which speak about their ''vamsha''.  Of these, only 8 lay claim that they belonged to the [[Yaduvanshi|Yadava]] line. While one inscription of 860 claims that King [[Dantidurga]] was born to the ''Yadava Satyaki'', 1800 coins of King Krishna I (772), his successor calls him ''Parama Mahesvara'' indicating his solar lineage origin and [[Shaiva]] faith.&lt;ref name="krishna1"&gt;Reu (1933), p11&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription of King [[Govinda III]] (808) mentions "by the birth of this virtuous king, the Rashtrakuta dynasty became invincible just as the Yadava dynasty by the birth of Lord Krishna". This is considered only a comparative statement.&lt;ref name="krishna"&gt;According to Reu, the Rashtrakutas considered themselves distinct from the Yadava line (Reu 1933, p11)&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few records attest to a possible Yadava connection and even the descendants of the Rashtrakutas such as the Gahadavalas of Kanauj, Rathors of Rajasthan claim to be from ''Surya Vamsha'' (solar lineage), a sure sign the Rashtrakutas belonged to the ''Surya Vamsha''.&lt;ref name="vamsha"&gt;Reu 1933, p13-14&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion that the Rashtrakutas did not belong to the Yadava line is supported by another scholar as well.&lt;ref name="yadu"&gt;Altekar (1934), p16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
While the linguistic leanings of the early Rashtrakutas (pre-8th century) has caused considerable debate, the history and language of the imperial Rashtrakutas of [[Manyakheta]] has been free of such confusion. It is clear from inscriptions, coinage and prolific contemporaneous literature that the court of these Rashtrakutas was multi-lingual, and used [[Sanskrit]] and [[Kannada]] as their administrative languages&lt;ref name="percent"&gt;Pollock (2006), p332&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="percent1"&gt;Houben(1996), p215&lt;/ref&gt; and encouraged literature in Sanskrit and Kannada.&lt;ref name="dal1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="admin"&gt;Kamath (2001), p73&lt;/ref&gt; Rashtrakuta inscriptions outside Karnataka are mostly in Sanskrit&lt;ref name="mas"&gt;Masica (1991), p45-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ravi"&gt;Rashtrakutas were Kannadigas from Lattaluru who encouraged Kannada language (Chopra, Ravindran, Subrahmanian 2003, p87)&lt;/ref&gt; However this period was the very end of the classical era of literary Sanskrit and Prakrit.&lt;ref name="end"&gt;Kamath (2001), p89&lt;/ref&gt; As such, from the Kavirajamarga of the 9th century, it is known that Kannada was popular from Kaveri river up to the Godavari river, an area covering large territory in modern Maharashtra.&lt;ref name="kavi1"&gt;Sastri (1955), p355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="god1"&gt;Rice, E.P. (1921), p12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="god2"&gt;Rice, B.L. (1897), p497&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rashtrakuta inscriptions call them the vanquishers of the ''Karnatabala'', a sobriquet used to refer to the near invincibility of the Chalukyas of Badami.  This however it is claimed should not be construed to mean that the Rashtrakutas themselves were not Kannadigas. Their patronage and love of the Kannada language is apparent in that most of their inscriptions within modern Karnataka are in Kannada, while their inscriptions outside of modern Karnataka tended to be in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="Karnatabala"&gt;Kamath (2001) p73&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription in classical Kannada of King [[Krishna III]] has also been found as far away as [[Jabalpur]] in modern [[Madhya Pradesh]] which further supports the view of their affinity to the language.&lt;ref name="Karnatabala"/&gt;

[[Adikavi Pampa]], [[Sri Ponna]], [[Shivakotiacharya]] and King [[Amoghavarsha I]] were among the noteworthy scholars in Kannada,&lt;ref name="kan"&gt;Kamath (2001), p90&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Apabhramsha]] poet [[Pushpadanta]] wrote several works and famous Sanskrit scholars such as [[Jinasena]] and [[Virasena]] (both of whom were theologians), mathematician [[Mahavira (mathematician)|Mahaviracharya]] and poets such as Trivikrama and Gunabhadra adorned their courts.&lt;ref name="san"&gt;Kamath (2001), pp88-89&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[Extant literature|extant]] Kannada literature belongs to this time.&lt;ref name="kavi1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kavi"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p2,p12,p18&lt;/ref&gt; These Rashtrakuta kings married princess from Northern and Southern India and several Rashtrakuta branches emerged in Northern India during their imperialistic expansion in the 9th century.

The argument that the Rashtrakutas were either Marathi speaking Marathas or Telugu speaking Reddies in origin has been rejected. [[Reddy]]'s in that time period had not come into martial prominence even in the Telugu speaking regions of Andhra, being largely an agrarian society of cultivators who only much later (in the 14th century - 15th century) came to control regions in the Krishna - Rajamundry districts.&lt;ref name="rajmundry"&gt;Altekar (1943), p18&lt;/ref&gt; The Rashtrakuta period did not produce any Marathi inscriptions or literature (with the exception of a 981 CE Shravanabelagola inscription which some historians argue was inscribed later).&lt;ref name="prak"&gt;Altekar (1934), p412&lt;/ref&gt; In addition very few literary works in Prakrit language are available from this period. Jainism which played such an important role in giving patronage to early Kannada literature did not flourish as much in the present day Maharashtra region which is why no Marathi literature emerged during this period. Hence Marathi as the language of the Rashtrakutas, it is claimed, is not an acceptable argument.&lt;ref name="unsustain"&gt;Altekar (1934), p413&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="861">'''Paroemion''' is the repetition of usually initial consonant sounds in two or more neighboring words or syllables (as wild and woolly, threatening throngs). It is also called head rhyme or initial rhyme. It is also [[alliteration]] taken to an extreme where nearly every word in a sentence begins with the same consonant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odlt.org/ballast/paroemion.html |title=ODLT |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rowlandrhetoric.wikispaces.com/Paroemion|title=RowlandRhetoric - Paroemion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example of paroemion is:

{{quote|The delicious doughnut drew delicate designs, drizzling delectable damson drops down Dave's duck-down vest. "Darn!" Dave declared dragging his dripping dukes across the dreadfully delightful disaster.}}

'''Pornography in Asia''' is pornography created in Asia, watched in Asia, or consumed or displayed in other parts of the world as one or more [[genre]]s of Asian porn.

===China===
{{main|Pornography in China}}
Internet pornography was outlawed in the [[People's Republic of China]] effective 2002, when state censors issued guidelines requiring that all websites remove any pornographic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, the production of pornographic films has been banned by state censors, the [[State Administration of Radio, Film and Television]]'s prohibition on pornography has been complete, and the government has shown no signs of changing course. Directors, producers, and actors involved in pornographic films have been barred from competing in any film competitions. Any [[film studio]] found in violation may have its license revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this regulation and censorship, adult films and media can only be obtained through the Internet and on the black market. Possession of pornography is punishable by up to 3 years in prison, a fine of {{currency|20000|CNY}}, or up to life imprisonment for large underground distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianlii.org/cn/legis/cen/laws/clotproc361/|title=Laws of the People's Republic of China (Articles 152 and 363 to 367)|website=www.asianlii.org|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 China shut down 60,000 pornographic websites according to the news agency [[Reuters]], arresting almost 5,000 suspects in the process.

===Hong Kong===
In [[Hong Kong]], pornography is illegal if sold or shown to children under 18 years of age, if it is publicly displayed (except within the confines of and only visible from inside a "bona fide art gallery or museum"), or if it is sold without    being wrapped completely with an "easily noticeable" warning stating that the material may be offensive and may not be distributed to minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap390 | title=Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance | accessdate=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
{{Main article|Pornography in Japan}}
[[Pornography in Japan]] includes pornography ranging from well-known sex acts such as [[bukkake]] to [[sexual fetish]] pornography such as [[tamakeri]].

As in Europe, photographs of nudes are not uncommon in the mainstream media. In the 1970s and 1980s, the strongest prohibition was against showing pubic hair or adult genitalia. Imported magazines would have the pubic hair scratched out, and even the most explicit videos could not portray it. Starting around 1991, photobook publishers began challenging this ban to the point where pubic hair is now fairly well accepted. Close-ups of genitalia remain proscribed. In 1999, the government enacted a law banning photos and videos of naked children, which were a fairly common sight in mainstream media before that time. [[Manga]] and [[anime]] remain largely unregulated, although large publishers tend to self-censor or specify that characters are at least 18 years of age.

The 1960s, in Japanese pornography, was the era of the independent ''[[Pink film]]''. In the years since the end of World War II, eroticism had been gradually making its way into Japanese cinema. The first kiss to be seen in Japanese film—discreetly half-hidden by an umbrella—caused a national sensation in [[1946 in film|1946]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bornoff|first=Nicholas|title=Pink Samurai: An Erotic Exploration of Japanese Society; The Pursuit and Politics of Sex in Japan|origyear=1991|edition=Paperback|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=0-586-20576-4|chapter=18 (Naked Dissent)|page=602}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, until the early 1960s, graphic depictions of nudity and sex in Japanese film could only be seen in single-reel "stag films", made illegally by underground film producers such as those depicted in [[Shōhei Imamura|Imamura]]'s film ''[[The Pornographers]]'' ([[1966 in film|1966]]).&lt;ref name="Erotic Nightmares"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/focus_takechi.shtml|first=Jasper|last=Sharp|title=Tetsuji Takechi: Erotic Nightmares|accessdate=2007-04-19|work=midnighteye.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nudity and sex would officially enter the Japanese cinema with the independent, low-budget softcore pornographic films which would come to dominate domestically produced films in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://194.21.179.166/cecudine/fe_2002/eng/PinkEiga2002.htm|title=Vital flesh: the mysterious world of Pink Eiga|accessdate=2007-04-19|last=Domenig|first=Roland|year=2002|quote=Since the mid-1960s, pink eiga have been the biggest Japanese film genre...

In [[1964 in film|1964]] [[Tetsuji Takechi]] made the first big-budget, mainstream ''pink film'', ''[[Daydream (1964 film)|Daydream]]''. Takechi would remake ''Daydream'' as Japan's first theatrical hardcore film in [[1981 in film|1981]], starring [[Kyoko Aizome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asahi.com/english/weekend/K2001120100409.html|title=Porn-star label now a badge of honor for actress|accessdate=2010-01-02|last=Koizumi|first=Shinichi|date=2001-12-01|work=[[Asahi Shimbun]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011203120520/http://www.asahi.com/english/weekend/K2001120100409.html|archivedate=2001-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Korea ===
{{Main article|Pornography in North Korea}}
Imported works of [[pornography]] have been available in [[North Korea]] in recent decades, mainly in the capital [[Pyongyang]] and typically in the form of [[CD-R]] copies bought secretly at markets. There is very little domestic production.&lt;ref name="Shin2015"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Pornography in North Korea | last = Shin | first = Junsik | work = New Focus International | date = 13 April 2015 | accessdate = 20 September 2016 | url = http://newfocusintl.com/pornography-in-north-korea/ | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150417152313/http://newfocusintl.com/pornography-in-north-korea/ | archivedate = 17 April 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Producing, distributing, importing and watching pornography is illegal.&lt;ref name="HassigOh2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hassig|first1=Ralph|author2=Kongdan Oh|title=The Hidden People of North Korea: Everyday Life in the Hermit Kingdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7T19CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106|edition=2nd|date= 2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham|isbn=978-1-4422-3719-3|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possession of pornography became widespread among elites during the late 1990s. Political and army elites are the most active consumers of pornography. Locally produced pornography initially appeared during the reign of [[Kim Jong-il]]. A typical North Korean-made [[pornographic film]] involves nude or scantily clad women dancing with music.&lt;ref name="Moon2007"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Porno Became Widespread in '90s, Thanks to the Dear Leader | author = Moon Sung Hwee | work = Daily NK | date = 23 December 2007 | accessdate = 21 September 2016 | url = http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01300&amp;num=3042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Importing pornography to North Korea is harshly punished. Pornography is sold openly on the [[China–North Korea border]] regardless of regulations.&lt;ref name="Schwartzman2009"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Is There Porn in North Korea? | last = Schwartzman | first = Nathan  | work = Asian Correspondent | date = 27 November 2009 | accessdate = 20 September 2016 | url = https://asiancorrespondent.com/2009/11/is-there-porn-in-north-korea/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite attempts to curtail circulation of imported pornography, most of the pornography watched in North Korea is currently made abroad.&lt;ref name="Moon2007"/&gt; A significant part of pornographic media in circulation consists of Chinese [[bootleg recording]]s of poor quality.&lt;ref name="Shin2015"/&gt;

There is [[Internet censorship in North Korea|no access]] to foreign pornographic websites from within North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = North Korea now blocking Facebook, Twitter, other websites | agency=Associated Press  | work = The Big Story | date = 1 April 2016 | first=Eric |last =Talmadge| accessdate = 21 September 2016 | url = http://bigstory.ap.org/article/128ede4fc729447ab4540a7438ce0175/north-korea-now-blocking-facebook-twitter-other-websites-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea has ratified the [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]] of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = North Korea | author =  | work = Human Rights Watch | date =  | accessdate = 21 September 2016 | url = https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/north-korea}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are currently no specific laws to combat [[child pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.icmec.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Child-Pornography-Model-Law-8th-Ed-Final-linked.pdf#45|page=34|title=Child Pornography: Model Legislation &amp; Global Review|edition=8th|date=2016|publisher=International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children|access-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Korea ===
Pornographic websites, books, writings, films, magazines, photographs or other materials of a pornographic nature are illegal in South Korea, although the law is not regularly enforced. Distribution of pornography can result in a fine or a two-year prison sentence. Since 2009, pornographic websites have been blocked by the South Korean government. In 2012 the [[Ministry of Public Administration and Security]] released statistics that cited 39.5% of South Korean children having experienced watching online pornography, with 14.2% of those who have viewed online pornography reportedly "wanting to imitate" it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Hye-jin (혜진) | last = Kwon (권) | script-title=ko:청소년 14.2% "야동 따라하고 싶었다" | date = 2012-07-30 | url = http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2012/07/30/0200000000AKR20120730074200017.HTML | work = Yonhap News | accessdate = 2012-09-02 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan pornographic films can be legally traded and pornography is available via a number of routes, including DVD, television and the Internet. The level of piracy of pornographic films in Taiwan is high because authorities have not traditionally recognised their copyrights. Copyright protection is usually strictly applied in Taiwan, but pornography has been seen as an exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailynews.sina.com/bg/chn/chnpolitics/sinacn/20130108/18184135830.html|title=台灣首家正版成人頻道開播 或促成人片版權保護|lang=chinese|trans-title=Taiwan's first genuine adult channel launches and promotes adult copyright protection|author=|date=8 January 2013 |work=sina.com|accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public display of adult material is strictly prohibited. The [[National Communications Commission]] (NCC), the Taiwanese media regulator, monitors and categorizes the level of media and public material into four levels. Thus adult material is not seen for sale in authorized shops, but only in small and hidden places. Due to the lack of copyright, adult content produced in Taiwan has stayed in the form of "[[Webcam model|webcam chat]]". Prostitution is illegal in Taiwan. The Taiwanese government has planned to set up a zone for prostitution.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Southeast Asia ==

=== Brunei ===
Due to the high number of expatriates in this country, pornography from various regions such as the Americas, Africa and Europe are easily available in retail shops known as 'kedai runcit'. It is illegal to sell to minors, and it is illegal to produce pornography unless for personal use.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=== Indonesia ===
In conjunction with the [[Law of Indonesia|Indonesian legal system]] the [[criminal code]] (KUHP) is based on [[Roman-Dutch law]], though a draft revised criminal code (RUU KUHP) is under discussion by the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia’s long wait for its own criminal code|url=http://indonesiaatmelbourne.unimelb.edu.au/indonesias-long-wait-for-its-own-criminal-code/|date=10 November 2016|publisher=The University of Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pornographic material is prohibited by law from the KUHP, the law controlling pornography concerns over the potential danger of criminal offence by pornography as well as preventing under age citizens exposed to pornography. [[Indecent exposure|Suggestive]] materials in Indonesian media are rare. Current laws forbid the selling and buying of pornographic materials.
There is a ''Undang-Undang Anti-Pornografi'' (The Law of Anti-Pornography), but this has become controversial as it is seen to objectify women, and it can affect the local culture including some traditional art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bild.de/news/bild-english/news/papua-new-guinea-penis-sheaths-could-be-banned-6981708.bild.html|title=Indonesian anti-porn law threatens natives: Penis sheaths to be banned in Papua police crackdown?|author=|date=5 January 2009|newspaper=Bild|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was concerned in the RUU (Law Proposal) is that child abuse is already recognized in KUHP (Kitab Undang-undang Hukum Pidana).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.undip.ac.id/14591/|title=Kebijakan Hukum Pidana Dalam Menanggulangi Tindak Pidana Perdagangan Bayi (Masters thesis) |publisher=Diponegoro University Institutional Repository (UNDIP-IR)|first=Herlina|last= Herlina|date=2005|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography in Indonesia is banned in terms of creating, distribution, selling, and rental of explicit materials. On 30 October 2008, the DPR passed [[Bill against Pornography and Pornoaction]], which is aimed at preventing pornography on widespread Indonesian media. A controversial element of the bill was the definition of pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-10-31/indonesia-passes-tough-new-anti-porn-laws/188804|title=Indonesia passes tough new anti-porn laws|author=Geoff Thompson|date=31 October 2008|work=ABC News|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the anti-pornography law was challenged but Indonesia's Constitutional Court upheld the ban and stated that the law's definition of pornography was clear and did not violate the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8586749.stm | work=BBC News | first=Karishma | last=Vaswani | title=Indonesia upholds anti-porn bill | date=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broadness of the law has concerned practitioners of sensual regional traditions such as the [[nightclub]]s in [[Bali]], [[West Java]]n [[Jaipongan|jaipong dance]], and [[New Guinea]]n [[Koteka|penis gourd]] wearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/world_agenda/article7077296.ece |title=Anti-pornography law challenges the penis-gourd wearers of West Papua |author= |date= |newspaper=Times Online |accessdate=9 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://swap.stanford.edu/20100328014705/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/world_agenda/article7077296.ece |archivedate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysia ===
Pornography is illegal in [[Malaysia]]. Possession of pornographic material is punished by [[Law of Malaysia|Malaysian criminal law]] and results in fine and up to 5 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4194674.stm|title=Malaysia targets mobile phone sex|date=2005-08-29|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Printing Presses and Publications Act of 1984'' subjects all offline media (such as newspapers, television, and radio stations) to licensing regimes granted at the discretion of ministers. However, the ''Communications and Multimedia Act of 1998'' pledged the Malaysian government to refraining from [[Internet censorship in Malaysia]]. Nevertheless, the ''Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission'', the main regulatory authority of information technology and communications industries, prohibits online content that is "indecent" or "obscene".&lt;ref name=ONI-Malaysia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opennet.net/research/profiles/malaysia |title=ONI Country Profile: Malaysia |publisher=OpenNet Initiative|date=7 August 2012|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, the Malaysian police announced the creation of the Malaysian Internet Crime Against Children Investigation Unit (MICAC) that is equipped with real-time mass Internet surveillance software developed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/exclusive/2018/07/388926/exclusive-police-will-know-if-you-watch-porn|title=Police will know if you watch porn|newspaper=Straits Times|date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is tasked with the monitoring of all Malaysian Internet users even on mobile phones, with a focus on pornography especially child pornography. The system creates a "data library" of users which includes details such as IP addresses, websites, locations, duration and frequency of use and files uploaded and downloaded.

{{Main article|Pornography and erotica in the Philippines}}

Any kind of pornography is illegal in the Philippines. This is due to the influence of [[conservative]] [[Christianity|Christian]] groups, such as the [[Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines]], and [[Church body|churches]], mainly the [[Roman Catholic Church]], among other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mentalhealthlibrary.info/library/porn/pornlds/pornldsauthor/links/philippine/pornx.htm |title=Pornography: Society at Risk |publisher=mentalhealthlibrary.info |accessdate=2008-01-01 |last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current law does not specifically outlaw [[webcam model|webcam-sex]] websites based in the Philippines. Law enforcement is light, and pornography is available often through black markets and the Internet. There are some urban areas that are known to publicly various kinds of pornographic films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philippines-for-men.com/blog/%5Buser%5D/legality-cam-porn |title=The legality of cam porn |publisher=www.philippines-for-men.com |accessdate=2008-01-01 |last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the existing laws, some reports claimed that the pornography industry in the country earned around US$1 billion annually in 2006, making it the 8th largest pornography industry in the world and the 4th in Asia. This also meant that it held the top rank in the whole [[Southeast Asia]], despite the fact that almost every month, the country's [[Optical Media Board]] (OMB) was confiscating hundreds of thousands of counterfeit VCDs and DVDs. From January to September 2008, the OMB confiscated 4,807,012 CDs costing [[Philippine peso|₱]]1.4 billion ($29,400,000; based on the prevailing peso-dollar exchange rate on 17 September 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinoyexchange.com/forums/showthread.php?t=397695 Report: Philippines' Porn Industry 8th Largest in the World] - PinoyExchange&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 14 January 2017, several pornographic websites including [[Pornhub]] and [[XVideos]] have been blocked in the Philippines upon the order of President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] as part of his Republic Act 9775 or Anti-Child Pornography Law. However, there are a few Internet service providers in the country which still allow access to these websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World’s most popular adult sites blocked in Philippines due to child porn fears|url=http://philippineslifestyle.com/adult-sites-blocked-philippines/|work=Philippines Lifestyle News|date=16 January 2017|author=M G Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal status of pornography in Kazakhstan was changed in 2013 with the introduction of the law: "On Ratification of the International Convention for Suppression of the Circulation and Traffic of Obscene Publications". This made it illegal to produce, possess or advertise pornography for the purpose of sale, circulation or public display. Additionally, the law made it a criminal offence to import or export pornography or run a pornography business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nazarbayev signs law on countering pornography|url=https://en.tengrinews.kz/laws_initiatives/Nazarbayev-signs-law-on-countering-pornography-19558/|date=22 May 2013|work=Tengrinews|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not an offence to access Internet pornography at home and Kazakhstan does block popular pornographic sites, such as [[Pornhub]], [[XVideos]] and [[xHamster]].

[[Softcore pornography]] and [[hardcore pornography]] movies/photos are easily accessible through [[Pornographic magazine|magazines]], [[DVD]]s, or [[Internet pornography|Internet]]. Buying and selling [[sex toys]] is illegal; nonetheless, sex toys are sold at selected places in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getahead.rediff.com/report/2009/jul/28/whats-it-like-shopping-for-sex-toys-in-india.htm|title=What's it like shopping for sex toys in India?|author1=anvi Saraf|author2=Manasa Madishetty|date=28 July 2009|work=Rediff|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/durex-is-fine-but-is-india-ready-for-sex-toys/articleshow/1346269.cms|title=Durex is fine, but is India ready for sex toys?|author=Kaushik Deka|date=24 November 2005|work=The Economic Times|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Child pornography]] is illegal ("child" is defined as a person under 18) to possess, produce (in terms of electronic copies), or to distribute and is labelled as crime. Section 67 of the "Information Technology Act" deals with "publishing obscene information in electronic form". This law has been interpreted to criminalize posting of pornographic content online. Accessing of "obscene" content within one's privacy is legal. The IT Act was amended by the Parliament in 2008, and Section 67B was inserted, which criminalizes browsing, downloading, creation, or publishing of child pornography. Therefore, while it is legal to watch adult porn, it has been made illegal to watch child porn.&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-02-16/india/28032470_1_cyber-terrorism-child-pornography-section-67b|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130103075109/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-02-16/india/28032470_1_cyber-terrorism-child-pornography-section-67b|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-03|title= Browsing child porn will land you in jail|work=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=16 February 2009|date=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russian humour''' gains much of its wit from the [[inflection]] of the [[Russian language]], allowing for plays on words and unexpected associations. As with any other culture's humour, its vast scope ranges from lewd jokes and wordplay to political satire.

== Jokes ==

{{main|Russian jokes|Russian political jokes}}

The most popular form of Russian humour consists of [[joke]]s (анекдо́ты — anekdoty), which are short stories with a [[punch line]]. Typical of Russian joke culture is a series of categories with fixed and highly familiar settings and characters. Surprising effects are achieved by an endless variety of plots and plays on words.

=== Jews ===

[[Jew]]ish humor is a highly developed subset of Russian humor, largely based on the [[Russian Jew]]s' self-image. These Jewish anecdotes are not the same as anti-Semitic jokes. As some Jews say themselves, Jewish jokes are being made by either anti-Semites or the Jews themselves.  Instead, whether told by Jews or non-Jewish Russians, these jokes show cynicism, [[self-irony]], and wit that is characteristic of Jewish humor both in Russia and elsewhere in the world (see [[Jewish humor]]). The jokes are usually told with a characteristic Jewish accent (stretching out syllables, parodying the [[uvular trill]] of "R", etc.) and some peculiarities of sentence structure [[calque]]d into Russian from [[Yiddish]]. Many of these jokes are set in [[Odessa]], and to some extent the phrase "[[Odessa humor]]" is synonymous with "Jewish jokes," even if the characters don't have Jewish names and even their religion/ethnicity is never mentioned. To Russians, it is sufficient to begin a joke with: "So, an Odessan woman gets on the bus...", and her Jewishness is implicitly understood by the listener.

== Toasts ==

Drinking [[toast (honor)|toasts]] can take the form of anecdotes or not-so-short stories, concluded with "So here's to..." with a witty punchline referring to the initial story.

== Chastushka ==

{{main|Chastushka}}

A specific form of humour is [[chastushka]]s, songs composed of four-line rhymes, usually  of lewd, humoristic, or satiric content.

== Black humour ==

Apart from jokes, Russian humour is expressed in [[word play]] and short poems including nonsense and [[Black comedy|black humour]] verses, similar to some of the macabre "nursery rhymes" of [[Edward Lear]].

Often they have recurring characters such as "little boy", "Vova", "a girl", "Masha". Most rhymes involve death or a painful experience either for the protagonists or other people. This type of joke is especially popular with children.

[[File:Sagan biyegu 2012.jpg|thumb|200px|Serving rice wine during Sagan, note egg and smoked fish in left hand]]

'''Sagun''' ([[Devanagari]]: सगं) is a Nepalese ceremony which involves ritualized presentation of auspicious food to a person to invoke good fortune and show respect. It is a highly revered ceremony in [[Newar]] society of the [[Kathmandu Valley]]. The food items served are boiled egg, smoked fish, meat, [[lentil]] cake and [[rice wine]] which represent [[Tantra|Tantric]] concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Vaidya |first1= Tulasī Rāma | last2= Mānandhara |first2= Triratna | last3= Joshi |first3= Shankar Lal |date=1993 |title= Social History of Nepal | publisher= Anmol Publications |isbn=9788170417996 |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sagan is presented during life-cycle events like birthdays, weddings and old-age rites. It is also presented at the [[Mha Puja]] ceremony on New Year's Day of [[Nepal Sambat|Nepal Era]]. Travellers are given the Sagan before departing on a long journey and upon return from a trip. People who have achieved a special feat or survived a life-threatening accident receive it. The ceremony is also held to honor somebody. The Sagan ritual is performed by both [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] Newars.

==Ceremony==
As per the general practice, the person receiving the Sagan sits cross-legged on the floor, and a Sukunda oil lamp is placed on a large leaf in front and to the right. The eldest woman in the house brings a tray containing flowers, rice and red paste and worships Lord [[Ganesha|Ganesh]], the god of good fortune, on the Sukunda. She then puts a dab of red paste on the forehead of the honoree and others in the room. The participants also take a dab of yogurt from a bowl and put it on the temple.

The main ritual is performed next. The lady of the house presents a boiled egg and smoked fish which the participants accept with both hands. A woman helper follows pouring rice wine from a jar into little bowls. After everyone has been served, she walks down the line again pouring wine three times into each bowl. She serves wine a third time after which the participants can set down the bowls.

The procedure and materials may vary as per family tradition and geography. [[Laddu]] (sweet balls) or Lāgwah ([[meat ball]]s) may be presented in place of boiled eggs. Seating may be arranged on the floor or on chairs.

==Significance==
The Sagan ceremony and the materials used are based on [[Tantra|Tantric]] tradition. The five food items in Sagan represent the five Tantric elements (panchatatwa) – fire or "agni tatwa" (symbolized by wine), earth or "prithvi tatwa" (meat), water or "jal tatwa" (fish), ether or "akash tatwa" (lentil cake) and air or "wayu tatwa" (egg). The warmth and fire in living beings is provided by fire, and when a being dies, the body becomes the earth, the body contains water, breathe air and exist in ether or space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Juju |first1=Baldev |last2=Shrestha |first2=Surendra Man |date=1985 |title=Nepa ya Tantric Dyah wa Tantric Puja |trans-title=Nepal's Tantric Deity and Tantric Worship |language=Newari|location=Kathmandu |publisher=Baldev Juju and Surendra Man Shrestha|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Löwdin |first= Per |date=1985 |title= Food ritual and society among the Newars | publisher= Uppsala University |isbn=9789150605938 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Space tourism''' is [[Human spaceflight|space travel]] for recreational, leisure or business{{citation needed|reason=Why would 'business travel' be lumped with 'tourism' here; needs a source|date=November 2018}} purposes. There are several different types of space tourism, including orbital, suborbital and lunar space tourism. To date, orbital space tourism has been performed only by the [[Russian Space Agency]].{{cn|reason=Think it was done by a company called [[Space Adventures]] who contracted for a bulk purchase of so many non-NASA and non-Roscosmos astronauts to go to the space station privately.  From previous reading, I believe it was Space Adventures that hatched the biz plan for that, and they approached the Russian government to negotiate the bulk buy of Soyuz seats at a price that the Russian government preferred over sending one more Russian cosmonaut to the ISS on various occasions.|date=November 2018}}   Work also continues towards developing suborbital space tourism vehicles. This is being done by aerospace companies like [[Blue Origin]] and [[Virgin Galactic]]. In addition, [[SpaceX]] (an aerospace manufacturer) announced in 2018 that it is [[SpaceX Lunar Tourism Mission|planning on sending two space tourists]] on a free-return trajectory around the [[Moon]] on the upper stage of SpaceX's [[BFR (rocket)|BFR]] rocket, known as the Big Falcon Spaceship (BFS).&lt;ref name="teslarati_moonflight"&gt; {{cite news |author=Eric Ralph |title=SpaceX has signed a private passenger for the first BFR launch around the Moon |url=https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-private-passenger-bfr-moon-mission/ |accessdate=14 September 2018 |date=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grush"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grush |first1=Loren |title=SpaceX says it will send someone around the Moon on its future monster rocket |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/13/17857872/spacex-moon-trip-passenger-announcement-bfr |date=14 September 2018 |publisher=The Verge |accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period from 2001 to 2009, the publicized price for flights brokered by [[Space Adventures]] to the [[International Space Station]] aboard a Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] was in the range of US$20–40 million. 7 space tourists made 8 space flights during this time. Some space tourists have signed contracts with third parties to conduct certain research activities while in orbit. By 2007, space tourism was thought to be one of the earliest [[market economy|markets]] that would [[emergence|emerge]] for commercial spaceflight.&lt;ref name="belfiore2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Belfiore|first1=Michael |title=Rocketeers: how a visionary band of business leaders, engineers, and pilots is boldly privatizing space |date=2007 |publisher=Smithsonian Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-114903-0 |page=&lt;!-- use 'rp' template following to allow multiple reference --&gt; |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} Space Adventures is the only company that has sent paying passengers to space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schneider |first=Mike |url=http://newsok.com/intl-space-station-ticket-price-climbs/article/3086305 |title=Int'l space station ticket price climbs |publisher=NewsOK |date=July 18, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGz4Sqzb?url=http://newsok.com/intl-space-station-ticket-price-climbs/article/3086305 |archivedate=April 30, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSN"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/13304491 | author=Boyle, Alan | title=Regulators OK Oklahoma spaceport | publisher=MSNBC | date=June 13, 2006 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGzAWtfa?url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13304491 | archivedate=April 30, 2013 | deadurl=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with the [[Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation]] and [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|Rocket and Space Corporation Energia]], Space Adventures facilitated the flights for all of the world's first private space explorers. The first three participants paid in excess of $20 million (USD) each for their 10-day visit to the ISS.

Russia halted orbital space tourism in 2010 due to the increase in the International Space Station crew size, using the seats for expedition crews that would previously have been sold to paying spaceflight participants.&lt;ref name="nomorespacetourism"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6223VF20100303|title=Russia halts space tours as U.S. retires Shuttle|date=March 3, 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGoikevy?url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/03/03/us-space-russia-idUSTRE6223VF20100303|archivedate=April 30, 2013|deadurl=no|publisher=Reuters|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interfaxtourism"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://interfax.ru/society/news.asp?id=128393 |title=Russia will restore space tourism since 2012 |publisher=Interfax |date=March 18, 2010 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orbital tourist flights were set to resume in 2015 but the one planned was postponed indefinitely and none have occurred since 2009.&lt;ref name="spaceadventures.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spaceadventures.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=orbital.Orbital|title=Space Station Experience|work=Space Adventures|access-date=2017-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative term to "tourism", some organizations such as the [[Commercial Spaceflight Federation]] use the term "personal spaceflight". The Citizens in Space project uses the term "citizen space exploration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizensinspace.org/citizen-exploration/ |title=Citizen Exploration |publisher=Citizens in Space |date=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

Many private space travelers have objected to the term "space tourist", often pointing out that their role went beyond that of an observer, since they also carried out scientific experiments in the course of their journey. Richard Garriott additionally emphasized that his training was identical to the requirements of non-Russian Soyuz crew members, and that teachers and other non-professional astronauts chosen to fly with NASA are called astronauts. He has said that if the distinction has to be made, he would rather be called "private astronaut" than "tourist".&lt;ref name="Garriott"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.richardinspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.welcome&amp;theyear=2008&amp;themonth=1&amp;view=18 | title=Do Not Call Me A Space Tourist! | publisher=Richard Garriot's Space Mission | date=January 31, 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627164655/http://www.richardinspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.welcome&amp;theyear=2008&amp;themonth=1&amp;view=18 | archivedate=June 27, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Tito has asked to be known as an "independent researcher",{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} and Mark Shuttleworth described himself as a "pioneer of commercial space travel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Knight |first=Will |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2190-space-tourist-insists-on-pioneering-role.html |title='Space tourist' insists on pioneering role |work=New Scientist |date=April 20, 2002 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GH4qDYqY?url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4623674/ |archivedate=April 30, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Olsen prefers "private researcher",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyle |first=Alan | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4623674/ | title=Space millionaire to mix science with pleasure |publisher= MSNBC |date=March 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Anousheh Ansari prefers the term "private space explorer".&lt;ref name="Anousheh Ansari"/&gt; Other space enthusiasts object to the term on similar grounds. [[Rick Tumlinson]] of the [[Space Frontier Foundation]], for example, has said: "I hate the word tourist, and I always will ... 'Tourist' is somebody in a flowered shirt with three cameras around his neck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Foust | first = Jeff | title = Is it time to dump the t-word? | url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/280/1 | publisher=The Space Review |date=November 29, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian cosmonaut [[Maksim Surayev]] told the press in 2009 not to describe [[Guy Laliberté]] as a tourist: "It's become fashionable to speak of space tourists. He is not a tourist but a participant in the mission."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Circus_man_ready_to_make_fairy_tale_come_true_in_space_999.html |title=Circus man ready to make 'fairy tale' come true in space |publisher=Space Travel |date=September 10, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GH4zJoYz?url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Circus_man_ready_to_make_fairy_tale_come_true_in_space_999.html |archivedate=April 30, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Spaceflight participant]]" is the official term used by NASA and the Russian Federal Space Agency to distinguish between private space travelers and career astronauts. Tito, Shuttleworth, Olsen, Ansari, and Simonyi were designated as such during their respective space flights. NASA also lists [[Christa McAuliffe]] as a spaceflight participant (although she did not pay a fee), apparently due to her non-technical duties aboard the [[STS-51-L]] flight.

The US Federal Aviation Administration awards the title of "[[Commercial Astronaut]]" to trained crew members of privately funded spacecraft. The only people currently holding this title are [[Mike Melvill]] and [[Brian Binnie]], the pilots of [[SpaceShipOne]].

==Precursors==
{{see also|Space Race}}
The Soviet space program was aggressive in broadening the pool of [[cosmonauts]]. The Soviet [[Interkosmos|Intercosmos]] program included cosmonauts selected from [[Warsaw Pact]] member countries (Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania) and later from allies of the USSR (Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam) and [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] countries (India, Syria, Afghanistan). Most of these cosmonauts received full training for their missions and were treated as equals, but were generally given shorter flights than Soviet cosmonauts. The [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) also took advantage of the program.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

The US space shuttle program included [[payload Specialist|payload specialist]] positions which were usually filled by representatives of companies or institutions managing a specific payload on that mission. These payload specialists did not receive the same training as professional [[NASA]] astronauts and were not employed by NASA. In 1983, [[Ulf Merbold]] from ESA and [[Byron K. Lichtenberg|Byron Lichtenberg]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] (engineer and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] fighter pilot) were the first payload specialists to fly on the [[Space Shuttle]], on mission [[STS-9]].&lt;ref&gt;"Biographical Data: Byron K. Lichtenberg, SC. D.". NASA. Retrieved on 2012-09-10 from http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/lichtenberg-bk.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Astronauts/Ulf_Merbold |title=Astronauts: Ulf Merbold |publisher=European Space Agency |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGqMMhvy?url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Astronauts/Ulf_Merbold |archivedate=2013-04-30 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, [[Charles D. Walker]] became the first non-government astronaut to fly, with his employer [[McDonnell Douglas]] paying US$40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40000|1984|fmt=eq}}) for his flight. NASA was also eager to prove its capability to Congressional sponsors. During the 1970s, Shuttle prime contractor [[Rockwell International]] studied a $200–300 million removable cabin that could fit into the Shuttle's cargo bay. The cabin could carry up to 74 passengers into orbit for up to three days. Space Habitation Design Associates proposed, in 1983, a cabin for 72 passengers in the bay. Passengers were located in six sections, each with windows and its own loading ramp, and with seats in different configurations for launch and landing. Another proposal was based on the Spacelab habitation modules, which provided 32 seats in the payload bay in addition to those in the cockpit area. A 1985 presentation to the [[National Space Society]] stated that, although flying tourists in the cabin would cost $1 to 1.5 million per passenger without government subsidy, within 15 years 30,000 people a year would pay US$25,000 ({{Inflation|US|25000|1985|fmt=eq}}) each to fly in space on new spacecraft. The presentation also forecast flights to [[lunar orbit]] within 30 years and visits to the lunar surface within 50 years.&lt;ref name="l5198504"&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/the_space_tourist.shtml | title=Space Tourism Could Drive Space Development | publisher=American Astronautical Society | accessdate=2012-02-17 | author=Citron, Robert | booktitle=The Space Tourist |date=April 1985 | conference=Fourth Annual L5 Space Development Conference, National Space Society | location=Washington DC | pages=85–771 to 85–774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the shuttle program expanded in the early 1980s, NASA began a Space Flight Participant program to allow citizens without scientific or governmental roles to fly. [[Christa McAuliffe]] was chosen as the first [[Teacher in Space]] in July 1985 from 11,400 applicants. 1,700 applied for the Journalist in Space program. An Artist in Space program was considered, and NASA expected that after McAuliffe's flight two to three civilians a year would fly on the shuttle. After McAuliffe was killed in the [[Challenger disaster]] in January 1986, the programs were canceled. McAuliffe's backup, [[Barbara Morgan]], eventually got hired in 1998 as a professional astronaut and flew on [[STS-118]] as a [[mission specialist]].&lt;ref name="unl2011"&gt;{{cite book | title=Realizing Tomorrow: The Path to Private Spaceflight | publisher=University of Nebraska Press |author1=Dubbs, Chris |author2=Paat-Dahlstrom, Emeline |author3=Walker, Charles D. | year=2011 | isbn=0-8032-1610-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84–85}} A second journalist-in-space program, in which NASA green-lighted [[Miles O'Brien (journalist)|Miles O'Brien]] to fly on the space shuttle, was scheduled to be announced in 2003. That program was canceled in the wake of the [[Columbia disaster]] on [[STS-107]] and subsequent emphasis on finishing the International Space Station before retiring the space shuttle.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

Initially, senior figures at NASA strongly opposed space tourism on principal; from the beginning of the ISS expeditions, NASA stated it wasn't interested in accommodating paying guests.&lt;ref name="NoTourists"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/news/spacestation/mir_tour_iss_001101.html|title=NASA: No Room at the ISS Inn for Mir Cast-offs |author=Bridges, Andrew |publisher=Space.com |date=November 1, 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001109081900/http://space.com/news/spacestation/mir_tour_iss_001101.html |archivedate=November 9, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics Committee On Science of the House of Representatives held in June 2001 revealed the shifting attitude of NASA towards paying space tourists wanting to travel to the ISS in its statement on the hearing's purpose: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Review the issues and opportunities for flying nonprofessional astronauts in space, the appropriate government role for supporting the nascent space tourism industry, use of the Shuttle and Space Station for Tourism, safety and training criteria for space tourists, and the potential commercial market for space tourism."&lt;ref&gt;http://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t29.d30.hrg-2001-sci-0042&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The subcommittee report was interested in evaluating Dennis Tito's extensive training and his experience in space as a nonprofessional astronaut.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

With the realities of the post-[[Perestroika]] economy in Russia, its space industry was especially starved for cash. The [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] (TBS) offered to pay for one of its reporters to fly on a mission. [[Toyohiro Akiyama]] was flown in 1990 to [[Mir]] with the eighth crew and returned a week later with the seventh crew. Cost estimates vary from $10 million up to $37 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2013/08/03/people/toyohiro-akiyama-cautionary-tales-from-one-not-afraid-to-risk-all/#.W2De8jpKjcs |title=Toyohiro Akiyama: Cautionary tales from one not afraid to risk all |publisher=Japan Times |date=August 3, 2013 |access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/aviation%20timeline/1990.htm |title=World Aviation in 1990 |access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akiyama gave a daily TV broadcast from orbit and also performed scientific experiments for Russian and Japanese companies. However, since the cost of the flight was paid by his employer, Akiyama could be considered a business traveler rather than a tourist.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

In 1991, British chemist [[Helen Sharman]] was selected from a pool of 13,000 applicants to be the first Briton in space.&lt;ref name="FirstBriton"&gt;{{cite news |title = 1991: Sharman becomes first Briton in space |date=May 18, 1991 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/18/newsid_2380000/2380649.stm |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was known as [[Project Juno]] and was a cooperative arrangement between the [[Soviet Union]] and a group of British companies. The Project Juno consortium failed to raise the funds required, and the program was almost canceled. Reportedly [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] ordered it to proceed under Soviet expense in the interests of international relations, but in the absence of Western underwriting, less expensive experiments were substituted for those in the original plans. Sharman flew aboard [[Soyuz TM-12]] to Mir and returned aboard [[Soyuz TM-11]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}

== Sub-orbital space tourism ==
{{See also|Sub-orbital spaceflight}}

As of 2018, no suborbital space tourism has yet occurred, but since it is projected to be more affordable, many companies view it as a money-making proposition. Most are proposing vehicles that make suborbital flights peaking at an altitude of {{convert|100|-|160|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Scotland2040"&gt;{{cite news | title=Scotland 2040: Spaceships head for Moon with lunar golfers and crater ramblers aboard |date=October 12, 2006 |url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=6&amp;id=1510152006 |work=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passengers would experience three to six minutes of weightlessness, a view of a twinkle-free starfield, and a vista of the curved Earth below.

* [[Virgin Galactic]] aspires to be the first to offer regular suborbital spaceflights to paying passengers, aboard a fleet of five [[SpaceShipTwo]]-class spaceplanes. The first of these spaceplanes, [[VSS Enterprise|VSS ''Enterprise'']], was intended to commence its first commercial flights in 2015, and tickets were on sale at a price of $200,000 (later raised to $250,000). However, the company suffered a considerable setback when [[2014 Virgin Galactic crash|the ''Enterprise'' broke up]] over the [[Mojave Desert]] during a test flight in October 2014.

* [[Armadillo Aerospace]] was developing a two-seat vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) rocket called Hyperion, which will be marketed by Space Adventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The U.S. Commercial Suborbital Industry: A Space Renaissance in the Making |url=http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/media/111460.pdf |publisher=[[United States Department of Transportation|US DOT's]] Federal Aviation Administration |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperion uses a capsule similar in shape to the Gemini capsule. The vehicle will use a parachute for descent but will probably use retrorockets for final touchdown, according to remarks made by Armadillo Aerospace at the Next Generation Suborbital Researchers Conference in February 2012. The assets of Armadillo Aerospace were sold to [[Exos Aerospace]] and while SARGE is continuing to be developed, it is unclear whether Hyperion is still being developed.

XCOR Aerospace. Retrieved April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lynx will take off from a runway under rocket power. Unlike SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo, Lynx will not require a mothership. Lynx is designed for rapid turnaround, which will enable it to fly up to four times per day. Because of this rapid flight rate, Lynx has fewer seats than SpaceShipTwo, carrying only one pilot and one spaceflight participant on each flight. XCOR expect to roll out the first Lynx prototype and begin flight tests in 2015, but as of late 2017, XCOR was unable to complete their prototype development and filed for bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spacenews.com/xcor-aerospace-files-for-bankruptcy/ "XCOR Aerospace files for bankruptcy"] SpaceNews.

** Citizens in Space, formerly the [[Teacher in Space Project]], is a project of the United States Rocket Academy. Citizens in Space combines citizen science with citizen space exploration. The goal is to fly citizen-science experiments and citizen explorers (who travel free) who will act as payload operators on suborbital space missions. By 2012, Citizens in Space had acquired a contract for 10 suborbital flights with XCOR Aerospace and expected to acquire additional flights from XCOR and other suborbital spaceflight providers in the future. In 2012 Citizens in Space reported they had begun training three citizen astronaut candidates and would select seven  additional candidates over the next 12 to 14 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizensinspace.org/next-frontier/ "The Next Frontier For Citizen Science"].

== Orbital space tourism ==
{{See also|Orbital spaceflight}}

=== Successful projects ===

At the end of the 1990s, [[MirCorp]], a private venture that was by then in charge of the space station, began seeking potential space tourists to visit Mir in order to offset some of its maintenance costs. [[Dennis Tito]], an American businessman and former [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]] scientist, became their first candidate. When the decision was made to de-orbit Mir, Tito managed to switch his trip to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) through a deal between MirCorp and US-based [[Space Adventures]], Ltd. Dennis Tito visited the ISS for seven days in April-May 2001, becoming the world's first "fee-paying" space tourist.

Tito was followed in April 2002 by South African [[Mark Shuttleworth]] ([[Soyuz TM-34]]). The third was [[Gregory Olsen]] in October 2005 ([[Soyuz TMA-7]]). In February 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated on re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, killing all seven astronauts aboard. After this disaster, space tourism on the Russian [[Soyuz program]] was temporarily put on hold, because [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz vehicles]] became the only available transport to the ISS. After the Shuttle return to service in July 2005, space tourism was resumed. In September 2006, an [[Iranian American]] businesswoman named [[Anousheh Ansari]] became the fourth space tourist ([[Soyuz TMA-9]]).&lt;ref name="Anousheh Ansari"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.anoushehansari.com/about/ | title=About Anousheh Ansari |publisher=Anousheh Ansari (official website) |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In April 2007, [[Charles Simonyi]], an American businessman of Hungarian descent, joined their ranks ([[Soyuz TMA-10]]). Simonyi became the first repeat space tourist, paying again to fly on [[Soyuz TMA-14]] in March 2009. [[British-American]] [[Richard Garriott]] became the next space tourist in October 2008 aboard [[Soyuz TMA-14]]. As of 2018, Canadian [[Guy Laliberté]] is the most recent tourism to fly to the ISS, in September 2009 aboard [[Soyuz TMA-16]]. Since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, Soyuz once again became the only means of accessing the ISS, and so tourism was once again put on hold.

[[Bigelow Aerospace]] acquired the designs for inflatable space habitats from NASA's [[Transhab]] program, and has already launched two first inflatable habitat modules. The first, named [[Genesis I]], was launched in July 2006, and the second test module, [[Genesis II]], was launched in June 2007. Both Genesis habitats remain in orbit as of 2018.

==Legality==

Under the [[Outer Space Treaty]] signed in 1967, the launch operator's nationality and the launch site's location determine which country is responsible for any damages occurred from a launch.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/t/isn/5181.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

After valuable resources were detected on the Moon, private companies began to formulate methods to extract the resources. Article II of the [[Outer Space Treaty]] dictates that "outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/outerspt.html|title=The Outer Space Treaty|last=robert.wickramatunga|website=www.unoosa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, countries have the right to freely explore the Moon and any resources collected are property of that country when they return.

===United States===

In December 2005, the US government released a set of proposed rules for space tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/science/nature/4589072.stm |title=US draws up space tourism rules |publisher=BBC News |date=January 8, 2006 |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included screening procedures and training for emergency situations, but not health requirements.

Under current US law, any company proposing to launch paying passengers from American soil on a suborbital rocket must receive a license from the Federal Aviation Administration's [[Office of Commercial Space Transportation]] (FAA/AST). The licensing process focuses on public safety and safety of property, and the details can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter III.&lt;ref name="FAAReg"&gt;{{cite web | title=Code of Federal Regulations: Title 14, Chapter III |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |url= http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?sid=f32ec318140f194f1e3f1981d8192833&amp;c=ecfr&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title14/14cfrv4_02.tpl#300 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120716073206/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?sid=f32ec318140f194f1e3f1981d8192833&amp;c=ecfr&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title14/14cfrv4_02.tpl%23300#300 |dead-url= yes|archive-date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in accordance with the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act passed by Congress in 2004.&lt;ref name="SpaceTourismCongress"&gt;{{cite news |last=Boyle |first=Alan |title=Private-spaceflight bill signed into law |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6682611/ |date=December 23, 2004 |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GH5bPCkv?url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6682611/ |archivedate=April 30, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the New Mexico legislature passed the Spaceflight Informed Consent Act. The SICA gives legal protection to companies who provide private space flights in the case of accidental harm or death to individuals. Participants sign an Informed Consent waiver, dictating that spaceflight operators cannot be held liable in the "death of a participant resulting from the inherent risks of space flight activities". Operators are however not covered in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nmlegis.gov/sessions/10%20Regular/final/SB0009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes toward space tourism==

A web-based survey suggested that over 70% of those surveyed wanted less than or equal to 2 weeks in space; in addition, 88% wanted to spacewalk (only 14% of these would do it for a 50% premium), and 21% wanted a hotel or space station.&lt;ref name="Space.comSurvey"&gt;{{cite web |last=David |first=Leonard | url =http://www.space.com/news/061003_tourism_survey.html |title=Space Tourism Survey Shows Cost, Access Key Selling Points |publisher=Space.com |date=October 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has met with some criticism from some, including politicians, notably [[Günter Verheugen]], vice-president of the [[European Commission]], who said of the EADS Astrium Space Tourism Project: "It's only for the super-rich, which is against my social convictions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = EU official balks at space tourism | date = June 15, 2007 | url = http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=World_News&amp;subsection=Rest+of+the+World&amp;month=June2007&amp;file=World_News2007061523649.xml |work=The Peninsula |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116184043/http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=World_News&amp;subsection=Rest+of+the+World&amp;month=June2007&amp;file=World_News2007061523649.xml |archivedate=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental effects===

A 2010 study published in ''[[Geophysical Research Letters]]'' raised concerns that the growing commercial spaceflight industry could accelerate global warming. The study, funded by NASA and The Aerospace Corporation, simulated the impact of 1,000 suborbital launches of [[hybrid rocket]]s from a single location, calculating that this would release a total of 600 tonnes of black carbon into the stratosphere. They found that the resultant layer of soot particles remained relatively localized, with only 20% of the carbon straying into the southern hemisphere, thus creating a strong hemispherical asymmetry.&lt;ref name="GRL"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Martin |last1=Ross |first2=Michael |last2=Mills |first3=Darin |last3=Toohey |title=Potential climate impact of black carbon emitted by rockets |url=http://www.agu.org/journals/gl/gl1024/2010GL044548/ |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=37 |year=2010 |doi=10.1029/2010GL044548|bibcode = 2010GeoRL..3724810R }}&lt;/ref&gt; This unbalance would cause the temperature to decrease by about {{convert|0.4|C-change}} in the tropics and subtropics, whereas the temperature at the poles would increase by between {{convert|0.2|and|1|C-change}}. The ozone layer would also be affected, with the tropics losing up to 1.7% of ozone cover, and the polar regions gaining 5–6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adam |last=Mann |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101022/full/news.2010.558.html |title=Space tourism to accelerate climate change |work=Nature |date=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers stressed that these results should not be taken as "a precise forecast of the climate response to a specific launch rate of a specific rocket type", but as a demonstration of the sensitivity of the atmosphere to the large-scale disruption that commercial space tourism could bring.&lt;ref name=GRL/&gt;

===Education and advocacy===

Several organizations have been formed to promote the space tourism industry, including the Space Tourism Society, Space Future, and HobbySpace. ''UniGalactic Space Travel Magazine'' is a bi-monthly educational publication covering space tourism and space exploration developments in companies like SpaceX, Orbital Sciences, Virgin Galactic and organizations like NASA.

Classes in space tourism are currently taught at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] in New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Travis |last=Carter |url=http://journalism.nyu.edu/publishing/archives/livewire/archived/vacation_final_frontier/index.html |title=Vacation: The Final Frontier |publisher=NYU Livewire |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GH45ax8N?url=http://journalism.nyu.edu/publishing/archives/livewire/archived/vacation_final_frontier/index.html |archivedate=April 30, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Keio University]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robert-goehlich.de/lectures01.html |title=Space Tourism 1 Lecture |publisher=Robert A. Goehlich (official website) |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic potential===

A 2010 report from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], titled "The Economic Impact of Commercial Space Transportation on the U. S Economy in 2009", cites studies done by Futron, an aerospace and technology-consulting firm, which predict that space tourism could become a billion-dollar market within 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economic Impact of Commercial Space Transportation on the U. S Economy in 2009|url=http://www.faa.gov/news/updates/media/Economic%20Impact%20Study%20September%202010_20101026_PS.pdf|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|date=September 2010|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in the nearly two decades since Dennis Tito journeyed to the International Space Station, eight private citizens have paid the $20 million fee to travel to space. Space Adventures suggests that this number could increase fifteen-fold by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Spotts |first=Pete |title=A space tourism trip to the moon?

'''''Synthesia''''' is a piano keyboard trainer for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] which allows users to play a [[MIDI keyboard]] or use a [[Keyboard (computing)|computer keyboard]] in time to a [[MIDI file]] by following on-screen directions, much in the style of ''[[Keyboard Mania]]'' or ''[[Guitar Hero]]''. Additionally, Synthesia can be paired with MIDI keyboards that have illuminated keys, or with [[virtual piano|virtual]] [[player piano]] on screen, which some people believe makes learning piano easier for beginners. It was originally named '''''Piano Hero''''', due to the similarity of gameplay with ''[[Guitar Hero]]''; this was until [[Activision]] (the owners of the rights to ''Guitar Hero'') sent a [[cease and desist]] to the program's creator, Nicholas Piegdon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.destructoid.com/activision-sends-piano-hero-fella-cease-and-decist-denies-plans-of-lawyer-hero-30825.phtml | work=Destructoid | accessdate=2008-01-10 | title=Activision sends Piano Hero fella cease and decist; denies plans of Lawyer Hero}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.synthesiagame.com/cease.aspx | work=Synthesia Official Website | accessdate=2012-01-04 | title='Piano Hero' Name Cease And Desist From Activision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'''Synthesia''' was started around 2006 by American developer Nicholas Piegdon, and was originally named "Piano Hero". Hosted as an [[open-source software|open-source]] project on [[sourceforge]], it was released under [[MIT license]].

The program was originally [[Windows]]-only, but after a donation-drive in early 2007, the game was ported to [[Mac OS X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tuaw.com/2007/02/12/you-want-piano-hero-on-your-mac/ | work=TUAW| accessdate=2008-01-10 | title=You want Piano Hero on your Mac?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cease and desist letter===
In a letter dated 26 March 2007 Activision requested that Piegdon ''"immediately cease any and all use of the "Piano Hero" name in connection with the distribution and promotion of [his] video game and agree not to use such in the future"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/piano-hero/piano-hero-gets-cease-and-desist-249940.php | work=Kotaku | accessdate=2008-01-10 | title=Piano Hero Gets Cease and Desist | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709194743/http://kotaku.com/249940/piano-hero-gets-cease-and-desist?tag=gamingpianohero | archivedate=2012-07-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Piegdon responded by hosting a contest for a new name for the project, resulting in the name, Synthesia, suggested by Daniel Lawrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.synthesiagame.com/faq.aspx#what_is | work=Synthesia Official Website| accessdate = 2014-08-18 | title=Synthesia Name Change | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071024124344/http://www.synthesiagame.com/faq.aspx#what_is | archivedate = 2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continued development as closed-source project ===
After May 2012 Piegdon decided to stop releasing the [[source code]], as he saw the potential commercial value of the program. However the last open-source release version 0.6.1b is still available for download.

In the continued commercial version the basic functionality was still freeware. 
A "Learning Pack" key could be purchased to unlock the freemium additional features, such as a [[sheet music]] display mode. 
In December 2014, with Version 10 of Synthesia, the ability to use the program without purchasing it was removed, with the exception of several playable included demo MIDIs.

==Features==
Synthesia has support for playing custom MIDI files, as well as linking with MIDI devices. Synthesia will rate the player's performance afterwards, and give a score which can be submitted to an online scoreboard. Synthesia also has a paid "Learning Pack" that allows users to view music in [[Musical notation]], as well as multiple practice features, such as "Melody Practice" which pauses the song whenever the user misses a note, and only continues when the right note is played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.synthesiagame.com/ | work=Synthesia Official Website| accessdate=2012-03-10 | title=Synthesia Features}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Viennese coffee house''' ({{lang-de|das Wiener '''Kaffeehaus'''}}, {{lang-bar|des Weana Kafäähaus}}) is a typical institution of [[Vienna]] that played an important part in shaping Viennese culture.

Since October 2011 the "Viennese Coffee House Culture" is listed as "[[Intangible Cultural Heritage]]" in the Austrian inventory of the "National Agency for the Intangible Cultural Heritage", a part of [[UNESCO]]. The Viennese coffee house is described in this inventory as a place "where time and space are consumed, but only the coffee is found on the bill."&lt;ref&gt;[http://immaterielleskulturerbe.unesco.at/cgi-bin/unesco/element.pl?lang=en&amp;bl=0&amp;cat=3&amp;aufnahmejahr=0&amp;=Search&amp;suchtext= Intangible Cultural Heritage in Austria: ''Viennese Coffee House Culture'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Viennese coffee house culture ==

[[File:Cafe Braeunerhof Wien 2004.jpg|thumb|Coffee house culture: the 
newspaper, the glass of water and the marble tabletop]]
[[File:Wien Cafe Central 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Café Central]] in Vienna]]

The social practices, the rituals, the elegance create the very specific atmosphere of the Viennese café.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goeurope.about.com/b/2011/11/10/viennese-coffee-house-culture.htm about.com ''Viennese Coffee House Culture'']&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee Houses entice with a wide variety of coffee drinks, international newspapers, and pastry creations. Typical for Viennese Coffee Houses are marble tabletops, [[No. 14 chair|Thonet]] chairs, newspaper tables and interior design details in the style of [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://immaterielleskulturerbe.unesco.at/cgi-bin/unesco/element.pl?eid=71&amp;lang=en Intangible Cultural Heritage in Austria: ''Viennese Coffee House Culture'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian writer [[Stefan Zweig]] described the Viennese Coffee House as an institution of a special kind, "actually a sort of democratic club, open to everyone for the price of a cheap cup of coffee, where every guest can sit for hours with this little offering, to talk, write, play cards, receive post, and above all consume an unlimited number of newspapers and journals."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=JVEnG7KmIDYC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=Stefan+Zweig+caf%C3%A9+viennese+%22an+institution+of+a+special+kind%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Pgra0F1h9h&amp;sig=r8ttRFLPs-5vMaax027e_hGA7us&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=qMTKTtDOF4X6sgb42M31Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Stefan%20Zweig%20caf%C3%A9%20viennese%20%22an%20institution%20of%20a%20special%20kind%22&amp;f=false Robert Edward Norton: ''Secret Germany: Stefan George and his circle'' (Google books)]&lt;/ref&gt; Zweig in fact attributed a good measure of Vienna's cosmopolitan air to the rich daily diet of current and international information offered in the coffee houses.

In many classic cafés (for example [[Café Central]] and Café Prückel) piano music is played in the evening and social events like literary readings are held. In warmer months, customers can often sit outside in a [[Schanigarten]]. Almost all coffee houses provide small food dishes like sausages as well as desserts, cakes and tarts, like [[Apfelstrudel]], [[Millirahmstrudel]], [[Punschkrapfen]] and [[Linzer torte]].

Unlike some other café traditions around the world, it is completely normal for a customer to linger alone for hours and study the omnipresent newspaper. Along with coffee, the waiter will serve an obligatory glass of cold tap water and during a long stay will often bring additional water unrequested, with the idea to serve the guest with an exemplary sense of attention.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, leading writers of the time became attached to the atmosphere of Viennese cafés and were frequently seen to meet, exchange and to even write there. Literature composed in cafés is commonly referred to as coffee house literature, the writers thereof as coffee house poets. The famous journal ''Die Fackel'' ("The Torch") by [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] is said to have been written in cafés to a large extent. Other coffee house poets include [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Alfred Polgar]], [[Friedrich Torberg]], and [[Egon Erwin Kisch]]. Famous writer and poet [[Peter Altenberg]] even had his mail delivered to his favorite café, the [[Café Central]].

[[File:Cafe-schwarzenberg-innen-viennaphoto-at.jpg|thumb|Café Schwarzenberg in Vienna]]
[[File:Cafe-dommayer-innen-hietzing-viennaphoto-at.jpg|thumb|Café Dommayer in Vienna]]
Legend has it that soldiers of the Polish-Habsburg army, while liberating Vienna from the [[Battle of Vienna|second Turkish siege]] in 1683, found a number of sacks with strange beans that they initially thought were camel feed and wanted to burn. The Polish king [[John III of Poland|Jan III Sobieski]] granted the sacks to one of his officers named [[Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki]], who started the first coffee house. This story was published by the Catholic Priest Gottfried Uhlich in 1783 in his ''History of the second Turkish Siege'', and he took some liberties. In reality,{{editorializing|section|date=November 2015}} Kulczycki's coffee house missed being the first by more than a year. A more factual account has been reported by Karl Teply.&lt;ref&gt; Karl Teply: The introduction of coffee in Vienna. Georg Franz Koltschitzky. Johannes Diodato. Isaac de Luca. In: Society for History of the City of Vienna; Felix Czeike (ed.): research and contributions to the Viennese city's history. 6, Kommissionsverlag Youth and Culture, Vienna - Munich 1980 {{ISBN|3-7005-4536-3}} (208 pages, 15 illustrations&lt;/ref&gt;

After some experimentation, the legend goes on, Kulczycki added some sugar and milk, and the Viennese coffee tradition was born. This achievement has been recognized in many modern Viennese coffeehouses by hanging a picture of Kulczycki in the window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coopcoffees.com/resources/basics/coffee/coffee-timeline |title=Coffee Timeline |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517042816/http://coopcoffees.com/resources/basics/coffee/coffee-timeline |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another account is that Kulczycki, having spent two years in Ottoman captivity, knew perfectly well what coffee really was and tricked his superiors into granting him the beans that were considered worthless.&lt;ref&gt;Krystyna Bockenheim, ''Przy polskim stole'', Wroclaw 2003, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

According to recent research, Vienna's first coffee house was in fact opened by an [[Armenians|Armenian]] businessman named [[Johannes Diodato]] in 1685.&lt;ref name="Ellis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Markman Ellis|title=The Coffee-House: A Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRchtBDX1W0C&amp;pg=PT67|date=12 May 2011|publisher=Orion|isbn=978-1-78022-055-0|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Csendes|first=Peter|title=Historical Dictionary of Vienna|year=1999|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=9780810835627|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bxx-0fWXftQC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=1685+vienna+cafe+armenian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cWV1UqKMGZf_4AOt84DwDQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1685%20vienna%20cafe%20armenian&amp;f=false 47]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krondl|first=Michael|title=Sweet Invention: A History of Dessert|year=2011|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9781556529542|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gN6ySQnUnfwC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=1685+vienna+cafe+armenian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cWV1UqKMGZf_4AOt84DwDQ&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=1685%20vienna%20cafe%20armenian&amp;f=false 274]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCabe|first=Ina Baghdiantz|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|year=2008|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781845203740|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XnS6lVLapI4C&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=1685+vienna+cafe+armenian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bmZ1UoqWG5XI4APO74G4Aw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=1685%20vienna%20cafe%20armenian&amp;f=false 196]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15 years later, four Greek owned coffeehouses had the privilege to serve coffee.&lt;ref&gt;Teply, Karl: Die Einführung des Kaffees in Wien.

The new drink was well received, and coffee houses began to pop up rapidly. In the early period, the various drinks had no names, and customers would select the mixtures from a colour-shaded chart.

The heyday of the coffee house was the turn of the nineteenth century when writers like [[Peter Altenberg]], [[Alfred Polgar]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], [[Hermann Broch]] and [[Friedrich Torberg]] made them their preferred place of work and pleasure. Many famous artists, scientists, and politicians of the period such as [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Adolf Loos]], [[Theodor Herzl]], [[Alfred Adler]],&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, E. (1994). The Drive for Self: Alfred Adler and the founding of Individual Psychology. Reading, MA: Addison Wesley, pp. 52, 77, 85-86, 101&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[Leon Trotsky]] were constant coffee house patrons. In [[Prague]], [[Budapest]], [[Kraków|Krakow]], and [[Lviv]] and other cities of the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]] there were also many coffee houses according to the Viennese model.

In the 1950s, the period of "coffee house death" began, as many famous Viennese coffee houses had to close. This was due to the popularity of television and the appearance of modern espresso bars. Nevertheless, many of these classic Viennese coffee houses still exist. A renewed interest in their tradition and tourism have prompted a comeback. Some relatively modern Viennese coffee houses have emerged in North America, such as Julius Meinl Chicago and Kaffeehaus de Chatillon in greater Seattle and Cafe Sabarsky in Manhattan.

[[File:Satan Exulting over Eve.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Satan Exulting Over Eve'' by [[William Blake]]. The subject of the bull deals with the devil and his corruption of innocents through fornication.]]

'''''Vox in Rama''''' ({{lang-la|A voice in [[Ramah in Benjamin|Rama]]}}) is a [[papal bull]] issued by [[Pope Gregory IX]] in either 1232, 1233 or 1234 condemning a German heresy known as ''Luciferian'', a form of [[Satanism|devil worship]].&lt;ref name="Deane2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer Kolpacoff Deane|title=A History of Medieval Heresy and Inquisition|date=2011|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0-7425-6811-2|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bull was issued to [[Henry (VII) of Germany|King Henry]], son of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]], in June 1233 and subsequently to [[Siegfried III (Archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Siegfried III]] of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]] demanding they use all efforts to stop the practice.

==Background==
[[File:Konrad von Marburg.jpg|thumb|left|The inquisitor Konrad of Marburg, detail of a 13th-century church window, [[Elisabeth Church (Marburg)|Elisabeth Church]], Marburg. It was likely Konrad's report on the cult that inspired ''Vox in Rama''.]]

The 13th century was a time of great superstition and saw the start of the "demonisation of heretics"&lt;ref name=Kors&gt;{{cite book |last=|first=|editor-first=Alan Charles |editor-last=Kors |title=Witchcraft in Europe, 400-1700: A Documentary History|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|edition=2|date=2000|page=114 |chapter=IV: Popes, Theologians, Preachers, Lawyers and Judges |isbn=0812217519}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Church, attributing their lack of belief in the Catholic faith to the devil. Barber claims that it was during this time that there was a great zeal for the sending out of inquisitors by the [[pope]] and local bishops with the aim of seeking out potential [[Heresy|heretics]].&lt;ref name=Barber1&gt;{{cite book |last=Barber|first=Malcolm|editor-first= |editor-last=|title=The Trial of the Templars |publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=2|date= 2006 |page=114 |chapter=10: Conclusion |isbn= 0521672368}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1233, [[Konrad von Marburg]] (sometimes anglicized as Conrad of [[Marburg]]) began an inquisition in Mainz at the behest of either the Pope or the [[archbishop]].&lt;ref name=Barber2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barber |first1=Malcolm|year=1973 |title=Propaganda in the Middle Ages |journal=Nottingham Mediæval Studies |volume=17 |issue= |pages=42–57 |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegedly through torture and terror, Konrad reported he had uncovered a satanic cult which worshiped devils in the forms of a demonic man and of a diabolical black cat.&lt;ref name=Engels&gt;{{cite book |last=Engles |first=Donald W. |editor-first= |editor-last=|title=Classical Cats: The Rise and Fall of the Sacred Cat |publisher= Routledge|date=2001|page=183 |chapter=Appendix III: Pope Gregory and the ''Vox in Rama'' |isbn= 0415261627}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inquisition of Konrad was controversial: shortly after Konrad arrived in Mainz, a papal official called Bernard wrote to Gregory stating that Konrad had been forcing innocent people to confess by threatening them with burning at the stake if they refused to do so.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell|first=Jeffery Burton |title= Witchcraft in the Middle Ages |publisher=Cornell University Press|date=1984 |page=160 |chapter=Antinomianism, Scholasticism, and the Inquisition |isbn= 0801492890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Konrad was assassinated, possibly by the servants of [[Henry II, Count of Sayn]], whom Konrad had accused of fostering heresy.

The issue of the bull was a response to Konrad's allegations, urging Siegfried III and King Henry, representing the ecclesiastical and temporal authorities respectively, to seek out and destroy the heretics.&lt;ref name=Barber2 /&gt;

==Contents==

The bull describes in detail the initiation rites of the sect, claiming that the potential initiate is first approached by a mysterious [[toad]] as large as a dog.&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambert|first=Malcolm D. |title=The Cathars|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=1998 |pages=|chapter= |isbn= 063120959X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards an emaciated pale man would appear, whom the initiate would kiss and thereby forget all memory of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=Russell /&gt; Members of the sect would then meet for a meal.&lt;ref name=Lambert /&gt; When the meal had ended, the sect would arise and a statue of a black cat would come to life, walking backwards with its tail erect.&lt;ref name=Barber1 /&gt; First the new initiate and then the master of the sect would kiss the cat on the buttocks.&lt;ref name=Barber2 /&gt;

After the ritual was completed, the bull claims that the candles in the room would be extinguished and the sect would engage in wild orgies which were sometimes homosexual in nature. Once the candles are re-lit, a man from a dark corner of the room “comes forth from the loins upward, shining like the sun. His lower part is shaggy like a cat.” After a brief [[litany]]-like dialogue between the cat and the cult members, the meeting ends.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rodenberg, ''Epistolae saeculi XIII e regestis pontificum Romanorum selectae'', MGH, Berlin, Weidmann, 1883, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory also claims that the sect committed various [[Host desecration|crimes against the Eucharist]]:

{{Quote|text=They even receive the body of the Lord every year at [[Easter]] from the hand of the priest and, carrying it in their mouths home, they throw it into the latrine in contempt of the Saviour.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rodenberg, ''Epistolae saeculi XIII e regestis pontificum Romanorum selectae'', MGH, Berlin, Weidmann, 1883, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In conclusion, Gregory condemns the practice and calls upon the religious and secular authorities in the [[diocese]] to take action against the cult's participants.&lt;ref name=Lambert /&gt;

'''Wursten Frisian''' was a dialect of the East Frisian language that is thought to have been spoken until the early 18th century in the [[Land Wursten|landscape of Wursten]] between [[Bremerhaven]] and [[Cuxhaven]], Germany. Together with Harlingen Frisian and [[Wangerooge Frisian]] it belonged to the Weser Frisian group of dialects. The last East Frisian dialect still spoken today is [[Saterland Frisian]], an Ems group dialect.

==History==
The Wursten landscape was not part of the original settling area of the [[Frisians]] but was eventually colonised by them in the 8th century A.D. and became an independent municipality. When the East Frisian language began to fade in the 15th century it was successively replaced by [[West Low German]] dialects in the area between the rivers [[Lauwers]] and [[Weser]]. In Wursten however, the East Frisian language was upheld slightly longer than in [[East Frisia]] proper and in [[Ommelanden]] which is now a part of the Netherlands.

At the end of the 17th century the Wursten dialect was described in two lists of words but at the time it had strongly come under pressure. It is believed that in the first half of the 18th century, the Wursten dialect had as well become extinct.

==Linguistic properties==
The Weser dialects of the East Frisian language were unique among the [[Germanic languages]] as they kept full vowels in secondary syllables. This phenomenon was especially distinctive in the Wursten Frisian, the easternmost of the East Frisian dialects. In [[Old Frisian]] words with a short stem vowel the accentuation shifted from the first to the second syllable. Thus it could happen that not only the full vowel was preserved in what was now a stressed secondary syllable but the old stem vowel was partially reduced to a total loss. This transition process created words like ''snuh'' (son, from Old Frisian ''sunu'') or ''kma'' (to come, from Old Fr. ''koma'').&lt;ref name=Versloot&gt;{{cite book|last=Versloot |first=Arjen |year=2001 |chapter=Grundzüge älterer ostfriesischer Sprache und Literatur [Basics of the Elder East Frisian Language and Literature] |editors=Munske, Horst H. et al. |title= Handbuch des Friesischen – Handbook of Frisian Studies |language=German, English | location=Tübingen |pages=742–743 |publisher=Niemeyer |isbn=978-3484730489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only preserved full sentence in Wursten Frisian reads: ''"Kma wit hart ick will di wit tell"'' [Come here, I want to tell you something].&lt;ref name=Versloot/&gt;

== Substratum effects ==
Today, there are still some [[Stratum (linguistics)|substratum]] words of Wursten Frisian in the Low German dialect of the Wursten landscape. Århammar lists ''Maon'' ([[socage]]), ''Bau(d)n'' (horse-fly), ''Schuur/Schuulschotten'' (dragonfly) and ''jill'n'' (to shriek) as examples. Nothing remains however of the phonological characteristics of Wursten Frisian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Karl |last=Allers |first2=Nils |last2=Århammar |title=Wurster Plattdeutsch [Wursten Low German] |journal=Jahrbuch der Männer vom Morgenstern |year=1984 |issue=63 |pages=43–68 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
