The '''Astor Opera House''', also known as the '''Astor Place Opera House''' and later the '''Astor Place Theatre''',&lt;ref&gt;Not the same as the current [[Astor Place Theatre]]&lt;/ref&gt; was an opera house in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], located on [[Lafayette Street (Manhattan)|Lafayette Street]] between [[Astor Place]] and [[8th Street (Manhattan)|East 8th Street]].  Designed by [[Isaiah Rogers]], the theater was conceived by impresario Edward Fry, the brother of composer [[William Henry Fry]], who managed the opera house during its entire history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8oks8-lgwlgC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22Baltimore%22+%22Max+Maretzek%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIwofsuu3yxgIVA9SACh01QQeF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Baltimore%22%20%22Max%20Maretzek%22&amp;f=false|title=Good Music for a Free People: The Germania Musical Society in Nineteenth-century America|publisher=University Rochester Press|year=2010|author=Newman, Nancy|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=g724&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.724&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opera House ==

Fry engaged the Sanquerico and Patti Opera Company under the management of John Sefton to perform the first season of opera at the house. The opera house opened on November 22, 1847 with a performance of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Ernani]]'' with Adelino Vietti in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland, p.515&lt;/ref&gt; Sefton and his company were not re-engaged by Fry, and the opera management of the house went to Cesare Lietti for the second season. During his tenure the opera house presented the United States premiere of Verdi's ''[[Nabucco]]'' on April 4, 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vEYA8_RARL0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22Boston+Theatre%22+%22Max+Maretzek%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBjgKahUKEwjipKjEuPLGAhUN4oAKHYjAAUA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Boston%20Theatre%22%20%22Max%20Maretzek%22&amp;f=false|title=Verdi in America: Oberto Through Rigoletto|author=Martin, George Whitney|publisher=University Rochester Press|year=2011|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lietti was also replaced after one season, and the Astor's third and longest lasting opera manager, [[Max Maretzek]], was hired for the third season which commenced in November 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland, pp.515-543&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Maretzek founded his own opera company, the [[Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company]], with whom he continued to stage operas at the Astor Opera House through 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/11/23/89147004.pdf|title=Even the Prima Donna Blushed'|author=[[Harold C.

The theatre was built with the intention of attracting only the "best" patrons, the "[[uppertens]]" of New York society, who were increasingly turning out to see European singers who appeared at local venues such as [[Niblo's Garden]].  It was expected that an opera house would be: &lt;blockquote&gt;a substitute for a general drawing room &amp;ndash; a refined attraction which the ill-mannered would not be likely to frequent, and around which the higher classes might gather, for the easier interchange of courtesies, and for that closer view which aides the candidacy of acquaintance.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Parker Willis, quoted in Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.724&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  In pursuit of this agenda, the theatre was created with the comfort of the upper classes in mind: benches, the normal seating in theatres at the time, were replaced by upholstered seats, available only by subscription, as were the two tiers of boxes.  On the other hand, 500 general admission patrons were relegated to the benches of a "cockloft" reachable only by a narrow stairway, and otherwise isolated from the gentry below,&lt;ref name=g724 /&gt; and the theatre enforced a dress code which required "freshly shaven faces, evening dress, and kid gloves."&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.760&lt;/ref&gt;

Limiting the attendance of the lower classes was partly intended to avoid the problems of rowdyism which plagued other theaters in the entertainment district at the time, especially in the theatres on [[the Bowery]].  Nevertheless, it was the deadly [[Astor Place riot]] in 1849 which caused the theatre to close permanently &amp;ndash; provoked by competing performances of ''[[Macbeth]]'' by English actor [[William Charles Macready]] at the Opera House (which was operating under the name "Astor Place Theatre", not being able to sustain itself on a full season of opera) and American [[Edwin Forrest]] at the nearby Broadway Theatre. 

== Clinton Hall == 

After the riot, the theater was unable to overcome the reputation of being the "Massacre Opera House" at "DisAster Place."&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace, p.765&lt;/ref&gt;  By May 1853, the interior had been dismantled and the furnishings sold off, with the shell of the building sold for $140,000&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1854/06/01/75368321.pdf "The Mercantile Library"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (June 1, 1854)&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[New York Mercantile Library]], which renamed the building "Clinton Hall".&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1853/05/27/87854876.pdf "Exclusiveness"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (May 27, 1853)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1890, in need of additional space, the Association tore down the opera house building and replaced it with an 11-story building, also called Clinton Hall, which still stands on the site.&lt;ref&gt;White, Norval &amp; Willensky, p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Axess''' (アクセス国際ネットワーク) is a [[Computer reservations system]] based in Japan which provides its services in the Japanese market. It originated as the IT department of [[Japan Airlines]] called Jalinfotech. In 1991 it was established as an independent company it began to be marketed to travel agencies in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axess.co.jp/eng/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Axess partnered with [[Sabre Holdings]] in order to provide travel agencies in Japan with booking and ticketing capabilities for a wider range of international airlines.

On April 23 2012 Travelport, the business services provider to the global travel industry, announced a long-term agreement with AXESS International Network, the leading Japanese GDS owned by Japan Airlines (JAL).  Under the new agreement, AXESS will be hosted by Travelport in its Atlanta data center as a partition of the Travelport global distribution system.  The new upgraded AXESS GDS system, which will provide enhanced functionality to connected travel agency users, will be implemented by 2013.

By adopting Travelport's technology infrastructure, the AXESS GDS system will be enhanced with improved connectivity to airlines and a significant increase in the range of fares, shopping, hotel and car rental capabilities available for use by Japanese travel agencies and corporations. 

AXESS confirmed it had selected Travelport as its partner due to the two companies' mutual alignment on strategic thinking and saw the agreement as a significant step forward in reinforcing AXESS's position as the GDS of choice in the Japanese travel industry.

The aims of the group are typically to encourage trade with the host country and to provide a social environment for [[business network]]ing. Typically a BBG will organize trade missions, lectures and social functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbg-jed.org/constitution.html Example constitution, Jeddah BBG, Saudi Arabia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030809220617/http://www.bbg-jed.org/constitution.html |date=August 9, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many BBGs fulfill a charitable role, although that is not a primary function.

BBGs are often closely associated with the local British consulate or embassy, and with related organizations, such as [[the Middle East Association]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-mea.co.uk/ [[The Middle East Association]]&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|UKTI]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uktradeinvest.gov.uk/ UK Trade &amp; Investment: International Business, Exporting from the UK, Investing in the UK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623040852/https://www.uktradeinvest.gov.uk/ |date=2007-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Child work]]''' covers the application of physical and mental contributions by children towards achieving a personal or communal goal.

==Child work and indigenous American communities==

Children's work is a valued means of [[Child development of the indigenous peoples of the Americas|learning and child-rearing]] in many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]] communities.  It is seen as eagerly contributing in a collaborative and flexible environment, aimed at the children learning consideration, responsibility, and skills with the guidance and support of adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning by Observing and Pitching In Overview|url=http://www.learningbyobservingandpitchingin.com/icp-overview-english|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous American children are motivated to participate in the community because of [[Value (personal and cultural)|cultural values]], for example, everyone does something to participate, and wanting to be an equal member of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pewewardy | first1 = C | year = 2002 | title = Learning styles of American Indian/Alaska Native Students: A review of the literature and implications for practice | url = | journal = Journal of American Indian Education | volume = 41 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The children do not see it as working, but as helping, because they feel responsible for what happens within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coppens | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Alcala | first2 = L. | last3 = Mejia-Arauz | first3 =  | last4 = Rogoff | first4 = B. | year = 2014 | title = Children's initiative in family household work in Mexico | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 116–130 | doi =  10.1159/000356768}}&lt;/ref&gt; As demonstrated by a [[Nahua peoples|Mexican Nahua]] community, children are encouraged to begin child work at the age of two for about 6 to 7 hours a day. They do not need to be convinced to help, but want to be involved in the activity. Child work can be household help, taking care of family members, or helping in community endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alcala | first1 = L. | last2 = Rogoff | first2 = B. | last3 = Mejia-Arauz | first3 = R. | last4 = Coppens | first4 = A.

[[Indigenous American]] children learn functional life skills through real-time [[Observational learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|observation]] of adults and [[Child Integration|interactive participation]] of these learned skills within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=R.|author2=Rogoff, B. |title=Side by side: Learning through observation and participation|journal=Ethos|year=2009|volume=37|pages=102–138|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1352.2009.01033.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Active contributions to family and community work directly affects children's [[cognitive]] maturity by allowing children agency over their own development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdillon|first=Michael|title=Rights and Wrongs of Children's Work|year=2010|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4889-0|pages=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; This maturity at a younger age allows children to perform, potentially, higher-skilled tasks. For example, younger children have shown initiative by helping strangers to make them feel like a part of the community. Children do this by offering to help strangers or by treating them like family.&lt;ref&gt;Bolin, I. (2006). Growing up in a culture of respect child rearing in highland Peru. Austin: University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This maturity comes from the community fully incorporating children at a young age and allowing them to participate in everyday tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maynard | first1 = A | year = 2002 | title = Maynard, A. E.. (2002). Cultural teaching: The development of teaching skills in Maya sibling interactions | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 73 | issue = 3| pages = 969–982 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00450}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community trusts their children and treats them as equals, so the children want to engage in the community as much as they can. For example, parents trust their children to translate and negotiate bills with people, when the parents cannot speak the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reynolds | first1 = J. F. | last2 = Orellana | first2 = M. F. | year = 2009 | title = New immigrant youth interpreting in white public space | url = | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 111 | issue = 2| pages = 211–223 | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2009.01114.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
For example, the maturity that indigenous American children develop is demonstrated in Zinacantec [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] communities, where children learn complex motor skills and techniques for weaving through keen observation of working adults and by executing the skills themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=A. |author2=Greenfield, P. |author3=Childs, C.|title=Culture, history, biology, and body: Native and non-native acquisition of technical skill|journal=Ethos|year=1999|volume=27|issue=3|pages=379–402|doi=10.1525/eth.1999.27.3.379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in [[Peru]], young Chillihuani boys learn how to build shelters and homes by actively assisting adults during the building process by moving and placing appropriate size stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolin|first=Inge|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Child Rearing in Highland Peru|year=2006|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-71298-0|pages=63–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnographic studies show that Indigenous American children learn intently through keen observation in activities by other children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silva|first=Katie |author2=Correa-Chavez, M. |author3=Rogoff, B.|title=Mexican-Heritage children's attention and learning from interactions directed to others.|journal=Child Development|date=2010|volume=81|pages=898–912|url=http://www.learningbyobservingandpitchingin.com/intent-community-participation-facets/means-of-learning-1/silvacorrearogoff2010|accessdate=2014-05-22|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01441.x|pmid=20573112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's work is also attributed to learning [[Moral development#Morality and culture|cultural values]] in addition to individual personality development.  Many Indigenous children in [[Peru]] develop a sense of responsibility by participating in work often motivated by an internal and external drive to be an active participant in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ames|first=P.|title=Learning to be responsible: Young children transitions outside school|journal=Learning, Culture, and Social Interaction|year=2013|volume=2|pages=143–154|doi=10.1016/j.lcsi.2013.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paradise &amp; De Haan refer to this process as practicing responsibility and reciprocity through role-taking as an observing helper or active performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=R.|author2=De Haan, M.|title=Responsibility and reciprocity: Social organization of Mazahua learning practices|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|year=2009|volume=40|issue=2|pages=187–204|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1492.2009.01035.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through participation in work, most children in Indigenous American communities identify as cooperative members of a community through first-hand exposure to the direct impact of their action or inaction in community responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ames|first=P.|title=Learning to be responsible: Young children transitions outside school|journal=Learning, Culture, and Social Interaction|year=2013|volume=2|pages=143–154|doi=10.1016/j.lcsi.2013.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[San Pedro La Laguna|Guatemalan Mayan communities]], children are often expected to take part in these practices. When schools became prevalent, children who were not seen as providing valuable contributions to family and community endeavors may only then be sent away to school to make use of their time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|title=Developing Destinies: A Mayan Midwife and Town|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-531990-3|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some indigenous communities are skeptical of sending their children to [[Western Schools|western schools]], because their children lose the initiative to help their families and are not as motivated. Western schooling is a different way of teaching than indigenous communities teach their children.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn,S. (2007). Transborder Lives: Indigenous Oaxacans in Mexico, California, and Oregon. Duke University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0822339908}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children that go through western schooling learn English and end up translating for their families, which is another way of helping them or another way of learning. The children perfect their English and Spanish, as well as their social skills because they interact with many types of people by translating for their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reynolds | first1 = J. F. | last2 = Orellana | first2 = M. F. | year = 2009 | title = New immigrant youth interpreting in white public space | url = | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 111 | issue = 2| pages = 211–223 | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2009.01114.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning by Observing and Pitching In===

The initiative that indigenous children demonstrate is part of the process of [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In]]. LOPI is a seven faceted process of learning commonly used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] cultures. It fully immerses a child into the community and allows them to learn, through observation and participation, as they help within their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = B | year = 2014 | title = Learning by observing and pitching in to family and community endeavors: An orientation | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 69–81 | doi = 10.1159/000356757 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children learn through their work, which is a cultural tradition among indigenous people. Child work is a social experience that allows a child to gain a sense of responsibility and build ties among the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paradise | first1 = R. | last2 = Rogoff | first2 = B. | year = 2009 | title = Side by side: Learning by observing and pitching in. | url = | journal = Ethos Journal of the Society for Psychological Anthropology | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 102–138 | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1352.2009.01033.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Labour Organization recognition of child work vs. child labour==

The [[International Labour Organization]] recognizes the importance of child work in various cultures.  In most Indigenous communities, work is a source of pride for both adults and children.  Because of different cultural views involving labor, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) developed a series of culturally sensitive mandates including Conventions No. 169, 107, 138, and 182 to protect indigenous culture, traditions, and identities.  Conventions No. 138 and 182 lead in the fight against child labour, while No. 107 and 169 promote the right of indigenous and tribal peoples and protect their right to define their own developmental priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Larsen|first=P.B.|title=Indigenous and tribal children: assessing child labour and education challenges.|publisher=International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC), International Labour Office.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The [[ILO]] recognizes these changes are necessary to respect the culture and traditions of other communities while also looking after the welfare of children. In many Indigenous communities, [[parenting]] includes teaching children learn important life lessons through the act of work and through participation in daily life.

Working is seen as a learning process preparing children for the tasks they will have to do as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guidelines for Combating Child Labour Among Indigenous Peoples|year=2006|publisher=International Labour Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=92-2-118748-9|url=http://www.ilo.org/publns}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a belief that the family's and child’s well-being and survival is a shared responsibility between members of the whole family.  They also see work as an intrinsic part of their child's developmental process.  While these attitudes toward child work remain, many children and parents from indigenous communities still highly value education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Larsen|first=P.B.|title=Indigenous and tribal children: assessing child labour and education challenges.|publisher=International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC), International Labour Office.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ILO wants to include these communities in the fight against exploitative child labor while being sensitive to their traditions and values.

'''Corporatization''' is the process of transforming state assets, government agencies, or [[municipally owned corporation|municipal]] organizations into [[corporation]]s.&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540962.2018.1527533|title=Debate: Corporatization as more than a recent crisis-driven development|last=Voorn, Bart, Sandra Van Thiel, and Marieke van Genugten (2018)|publisher=Public Money &amp; Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferryetal" /&gt; It refers to a restructuring of government and public organizations into their administration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coporatization.asp#axzz2JheT95Nm | title= Corporatization| author=Investopedia | date= | work= | publisher= | accessdate= 2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of corporatization is the creation of [[State enterprise|state-owned corporations]] (or corporations at other government levels, such as [[municipally owned corporation]]s) where the government retains a majority ownership of the corporation's stock.&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marra"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alessandro_Marra2/publication/4732914_Internal_Regulation_by_Mixed_Enterprises_The_Case_of_the_Italian_Water_Sector/links/0deec529a2526c7663000000/Internal-Regulation-by-Mixed-Enterprises-The-Case-of-the-Italian-Water-Sector.pdf|title=Internal regulation by mixed enterprises: the case of the Italian water sector|last=Marra, Alessandro (2007)|publisher=Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the term may also refer to the construction of [[state corporatism]], where state-owned corporations are created and delegated public joint-stock, publicly listed companies, in order to introduce corporate and [[Outline of business management|business management]] techniques to social tasks resembling [[corporate nationalism]] as an alternative to privatization.&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; Corporatization can also refer to non-corporate entities like universities or hospitals becoming corporations, or taking up management structures or other features and behaviors employed by corporations.&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;

==History==
The move towards [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic reform and [[New Public Management]] public service reform in the 1980s led to privatization of public functions in many countries.&lt;ref name="Hood"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2807/1401574fd01fb00345dcba852f216a825e37.pdf|title=The “New Public Management” in the 1980s: variations on a theme|last=Hood, Christopher (1995)|publisher=Accounting, Organizations and Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporatization was seen as a half-way house on the road to privatization.&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard" /&gt; These [[state-owned enterprise]]s are organized in the same manner as private corporations, with the difference that the company's shares remain in the ownership of the state and are not traded on the [[stock market]].&lt;ref name="Marra" /&gt; Corporatization is today often seen as an end in itself in order to introduce autonomy in organizations, hoping that this brings efficiency gains.&lt;ref name="Voornetal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03003930.2017.1319360|title=The efficiency and effectiveness of municipally owned corporations: A systematic review|last=Voorn, Bart, Marieke L. Van Genugten, and Sandra Van Thiel (2017)|publisher=Local Government Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that the trend towards corporatization has sped up due to the financial crisis,&lt;ref name="Ferryetal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540962.2018.1486629|title=New development: Corporatization of local authorities in England in the wake of austerity 2010–2016|last=Ferry, Laurence, Rhys Andrews, Chris Skelcher, and Piotr Wegorowski (2018)|publisher=Public Money &amp; Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is evidence that there has been a trend towards corporatization since at least the start of the century.&lt;ref name="Voornetal18" /&gt;

== Reasons and effects ==
Corporatization can be used to improve efficiency of public service delivery (with mixed successes), as a step towards (partial) privatization, or to alleviate fiscal stress.

=== (Potentially) improving efficiency ===
A key purpose of corporatization is externalization.&lt;ref name="GrossiReichard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14719030802264275|title=Municipal corporatization in Germany and Italy|last=Grossi, Giuseppe, and Christoph Reichard (2008)|publisher=Public Management Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of corporatization has been to convert state departments (or municipal services) into public companies and interpose commercial boards of [[board of directors|directors]] between the shareholding ministers / city council and the management of the enterprises.&lt;ref name="Marra" /&gt; Such externalization creates legal and managerial autonomy from politicians, which could potentially increase efficiency, as it safeguards the firm from political exploitation. However, corporatization can also fail to bring efficiency (or cause inefficiency), because this autonomy reduces the government's ability to monitor its management. Whether corporatization is beneficial may depend on the nature of the service that is corporatized, where autonomy may be less beneficial for more politicized and complex services.&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt;

=== Step towards privatization or hybridization ===
Although corporatization is to be distinguished from privatization (the former involves publicly owned corporations, the latter privately owned ones), once a service has been corporatised it is often relatively easy to privatise or part-privatise it, for example by selling some or all of the company's shares via the stock market.&lt;ref name="Marra" /&gt; In some cases (e.g. the Netherlands in regard to water supply) there are laws to prevent this.&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; Corporatization also can be a step towards the creation of hybrid forms of organization, such as institutional [[public-private partnership]]s or inter-municipal service organizations.&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt;

=== Alleviate fiscal stress ===
Corporatization is also a means to alleviate fiscal stress, as corporations can become standalone organizations that do not count towards municipalities' budgets.&lt;ref name = "GrossiReichard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferryetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Citronietal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03003930.2012.707615|title=Remapping the state: inter-municipal cooperation through corporatization and public-private governance structures|last=Citroni, Giulio, Andrea Lippi, and Stefania Profeti (2013)|publisher=Local Government Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tavares"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03003930.2017.1356723|title=Ten years after: revisiting the determinants of the adoption of municipal corporations for local service delivery|last=Antonio Tavares (2017)|publisher=Local Government Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
Corporatization of state enterprises and collectively owned enterprises was a major component of the [[economic restructuring]] program of formerly communist nations, most notably the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; China's contemporary [[socialist market economy]] is based on a corporatized [[state sector]] where state companies are owned by the central government but managed in a semi-autonomous fashion.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/html/prddr/trans/n&amp;d95/china.htm|title=Reform of China's State-owned Enterprises A Progress Report of Oxford Analytica|author=World Bank|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604023901/http://www.worldbank.org/html/prddr/trans/n%26d95/china.htm|archivedate=2011-06-04|accessdate=1 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporatization has also been used in [[New Zealand]]{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} and most states of [[Australia]]{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} in the reform of their [[electricity market]]s, as well as in many{{vague|date=March 2016}} other countries and industries (e.g. Dutch water supply companies{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}).

==Major areas==
=== National level ===
On a national scale, major areas of services which have been corporatized in the past include:&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''National railroads''', the initial impetus to corporatization of functions that had belonged to national and local governing bodies began in the sphere of national [[railroad]] construction in the mid-19th century.
* '''Corporatized highways''', for example [[toll roads]].
* '''Corporatized electricity'''
* '''Telecommunications'''

=== Local level ===
On a local scale, major areas of services which have been corporatized include:&lt;ref name="Voornetal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voornetal18b"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327833751_Background_Autonomy_Steering_and_Corporate_Governance_Determinants_of_the_Effectiveness_of_Governance_of_Municipal_Corporations|title= Background, Autonomy, Steering, and Corporate Governance: Determinants of the Effectiveness of (Governance of) Municipal Corporations|last=Voorn, Bart, Marieke van Genugten, and Sandra van Thiel (2018)|publisher=Lausanne: EGPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3660">A '''cost-plus-incentive fee''' ('''CPIF''') contract is a cost-reimbursement [[contract]] that provides for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs.&lt;ref name="US"&gt;
   "Subpart 16.3—Cost-Reimbursement Contracts", U.S.
   [[Federal Acquisition Regulations]], July 2010, webpage:
   [https://www.acquisition.gov/far/html/Subpart%2016_3.html F3].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Like a [[cost-plus contract]], the price paid by the buyer to the seller changes in relation to costs, in order to reduce the risks assumed by the contractor (seller).
Unlike a cost-plus contract, the cost in excess of the target cost is only partially paid according to a Buyer/Seller ratio, so the seller's profit decreases when exceeding the target cost. Similarly, the seller's profit increases when actual costs are below the target cost defined in the contract.

==Formula and Examples==
Incentive contracts allow sharing of the risks between the contractor and the client. The contractor is reimbursed all its justifiable costs in addition to a calculated fee. The basic elements of a CPIF contract are:
:*'''Target Cost''': the estimated total contract costs.
:*'''Actual Cost''': constitutes the reasonable costs that the contractor can prove he has made.
:*'''Target Fee''': the basic fee to be paid if the Target Cost matches the Actual Cost (target profit). The Target Fee varies between the Minimum Fee and the Maximum Fee according to a formula tied to the Actual Cost (e.g. Target Fee could be 10% of the Actual Cost).
:*'''Sharing Ratio''': the agreed upon cost sharing proportion, normally expressed in percentage (e.g. 85% for the client / 15% for the contractor). It is often different for cost overruns and cost underruns.
Other components of incentive fee contracting include:
:*'''Maximum Fee''': the highest fee that may be earned, usually expressed as a percentage.
:*'''Minimum Fee''': the lowest fee that may be earned, usually expressed as a percentage.

The Final Fee (profit of the contractor) is expressed as follows: Final Fee = Target Fee + (Target Cost - Actual Cost) * Contractor Share&lt;ref&gt;In the formula, an asterisk ("*") is used for multiplication.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1642103&amp;show=abstract Badenfelt, Ulrika. "The selection of sharing ratios in target cost contracts." Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management 15.1 (2008): 54-65]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Final Price of the contract is expressed as follows: Final Price = Actual Cost + Final Fee

Note that if Contractor Share = 1, the contract is a Fixed Price Contract; if Contractor Share = 0, the contract is a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0263786394900450 Stephen Ward, Chris Chapman, Choosing contractor payment terms, International Journal of Project Management, Volume 12, Issue 4, November 1994, Pages 216-221, ISSN 0263-7863, 10.1016/0263-7863(94)90045-0]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, assume a CPIF with:
:*Target Cost = 1,000
:*Target Fee = 100
:*Benefit/Cost Sharing Ratio for cost overruns = 80% Client / 20% Contractor
:*Benefit/Cost Sharing Ratio for cost underruns = 60% Client / 40% Contractor

If the Actual Cost is higher than the Target Cost, say 1,100, the client will pay: 1,100 + 100 + (1,000 - 1,100) * 0.2 = 1,180 (contractor earns 80).

If the Actual Cost is lower than the Target Cost, say 900, the client will pay: 900 + 100 + (1,000 - 900) * 0.4 = 1,040 (contractor earns 140).

This issue featured entire schematic diagrams guides on how to build computer [[Galaksija (computer)|Galaksija]], created by [[Voja Antonić]].

The series of special editions was eventually developed into computer magazine ''Računari'' (Computers). Ristanović was a contributor of ''Računari'' for 11 years. After that, in 1995 Ristanović founded the PC Press publishing company and magazine ''PC'', the first privately owned computer magazine in [[Serbia]].

'''Down payment''' (or '''downpayment''', also called a '''deposit''' in British English), is a payment used in the context of the purchase of expensive items such as a [[car]] and a [[house]], whereby the payment is the initial upfront portion of the total amount due and it is usually given in cash at the time of finalizing the transaction. A [[loan]] or the amount in [[cash]] is then required to make the full payment.

The main purposes of a down payment are to ensure that the lending institution has enough capital to create money for a loan in [[fractional reserve banking]] systems and to recover some of the balance due on the loan in the event that the borrower [[default (finance)|defaults]]. In [[real estate]], the asset is used as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] in order to secure the loan against default. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender is legally entitled to sell the asset and retain a portion of the proceeds sufficient to cover the remaining balance on the loan, including fees and interest added. A down payment in this case reduces the lender's risk to less than the value of the collateral, making it more likely that the lender will recover the full amount in the event of default.

The size of the down payment thus determines the extent to which the lender is protected against the various factors that might reduce the value of the collateral, as well as lost profits between the time of the last payment and the eventual sale of the collateral.

Furthermore, making a down payment demonstrates that the borrower is able to raise a certain amount of money for long-term investment, which the lender may desire as evidence that the borrower's finances are sound, and that the borrower is not borrowing beyond his or her means.

If the borrower is unable to pay off the loan in its entirety, the down payment amount is forfeited.

==Amounts==
In the [[United States]], down payments for home purchases typically vary between 3.5% and 20% of the purchase price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hud.gov/buying/loans.cfm "HUD"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Housing Administration has advocated lower down payments since its inception in 1934, and, currently, borrowers that qualify for an FHA loan pay only 3.5% for a down payment. With rising home prices in the years from 2000 to 2007, lenders were willing to accept smaller or no down payment (either through 100% financing, seller-assisted down payment assistance, government down payment providers or by providing a combination of an 80% first and 20% second [[mortgage loan|mortgages]]) so that more individuals could purchase homes as their primary residences. Currently, in the United States, the Department of Veterans Affairs offers complete financing for qualifying veterans. The USDA Home Loan program also offers complete mortgage loans with no down payment. These loans are available as direct or guaranteed loans and are offered to qualifying borrowers purchasing a home in a more rural area. Most state finance housing agencies offer down payment assistance. In 2013, the agencies offer a program that provides assistance to qualifying homebuyers of up to three percent of the loan amount. The money from the state housing agencies can be used for down payment or closing costs.

There is more risk for lenders when individuals purchase a home as an investment property. Therefore, the lender may charge a higher interest rate and expect a higher down payment.

'''Dunbar Wright Bostwick''' (January 10, 1908 – January 25, 2006) was an American businessman, hockey player, pilot and horseman.

==Biography==
Dunbar Bostwick was the fourth child of [[Albert Carlton Bostwick Sr.]] and Mary Lillian Stokes. His father was a prominent New York automobile and yacht racer. His grandfather, [[Jabez A. Bostwick]], was a partner of [[John D. Rockefeller]] and a founder and treasurer of the [[Standard Oil Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1921/11/05/archives/29264181-to-heirs-of-mrs-bostwick-widow-of-the-standard-oil-man.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire) and Yale University. During his time at Yale, he served as co-captain of the famous 1932 hockey team and declined an invitation to play in the [[1932 Winter Olympics]] in Lake Placid.

In 1932, Bostwick married Electra Webb, a great-granddaughter of [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], and daughter of [[James Watson Webb, Sr.]] and [[Electra Havemeyer Webb]]. The couple had four daughters and spent their time primarily between New York, NY, Old Westbury, NY, Shelburne, VT and Aiken, SC.

==Military service==
During World War II, Bostwick served in [[London|London, England]] with the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]]. He returned as a Lieutenant Colonel with a [[Bronze Star]] and a Belgian [[Croix de Guerre]] for his help in the organization of the [[Normandy Invasion]] in 1944.

==Polo career==
Bostwick's siblings included [[Dorothy Stokes Bostwick]], [[Albert C. Bostwick, Jr.]], [[Lillian Bostwick Phipps]] and [[Pete Bostwick]]. Like his siblings, Bostwick was a competitive horseman, who competed in polo and [[Harness racing]] events all over the country. He earned a 6-goal polo handicap and played for the Aiken Knights and the Bostwick Field polo teams during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bostock.net/tree/bostgen/wnames/d/dunbar1907neww109.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Bostwick created Bostwick Field with his siblings [[Pete Bostwick]] and [[Lillian Bostwick Phipps]]. During the [[Great Depression]], the Bostwicks believed that everyone should be able to watch polo without being overcharged, which inspired Bostwick Field. The slogan of the field was "Polo for the Populace."

==Harness Racing career==
After he gave up polo in the 1940s, Bostwick turned to harness racing. He bred, trained and raced many successful [[Standardbred]] [[Horse gait#trot|trotters]] from his Bostwick Stables in [[Shelburne, Vermont]].

When his most famous horse, [[Chris Spencer (horse)|Chris Spencer]], went lame, Bostwick swam the horse twice a day in [[Lake Champlain]]. Eventually, the horse was back in racing condition and went on to win important races including the 1949 [[American Trotting Championship]] and [[Golden West Trot]] and the 1950 [[Roosevelt Trot]]. Chris Spencer was inducted into the United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.harnessmuseum.com/content/chris-spencer Harness Racing Museum &amp; Hall of Fame bio for Chris Spencer] Retrieved December 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Spencer was also the first horse to fly on an airplane, from Vermont to California to win the Hollywood Stakes race in 1952.

Bostwick was a member of the [[Harness Racing Museum &amp; Hall of Fame|United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame]] and founded the Saratoga Harness Racing Association and the Aiken Mile Track.

Throughout his life, Bostwick was engaged in multiple business ventures. He invented the magnetic snap barrier, an early gate that preceded current moving gates used at modern horse racetracks. Additionally, he served on the boards of the Aviation Instrument Manufacturing Corporation and Helio Aircraft Corporation, among others.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/28/sports/othersports/28BOSTWICK.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunbar Bostwick died in 2006 at age 98 at his home in Shelburne, Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/28/sports/othersports/dunbar-w-bostwick-harness-racing-innovator-dies-at-98.html New York Times January 28, 2006 article titled "Dunbar W.

Davis is the oldest of four children.

Davis left for California when Oklahoma's economy suffered from the collapse of the local oil industry.&lt;ref name="Barabak" /&gt; He founded and leads Strategic Perception, an advertising firm based in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="Lapowsky"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inc.com/issie-lapowsky/fred-davis-gop-most-notorious-ad-man.html|title=What You Can Learn from the GOP's Most Feared Ad Man|author=Issie Lapowsky|date=August 21, 2012|work=[[Inc.

==Work==
He created the ''Celebrity'' ad for presidential candidate [[John McCain]] and the ''[[Demon Sheep]]'' video for California Senate candidate [[Carly Fiorina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scherer|first=Michael|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1960405,00.html|title=The Mastermind of Carly Fiorina's Demon-Sheep Ad|publisher=TIME|date= 2010-02-05|accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis was described as "the most creative person in the business" by Republican media consultant Mark McKinnon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB122031187392488747.html |title=McCain Team Scrambles to Rescript Show |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412035936/http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB122031187392488747.html |archivedate=April 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His political clients have included [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]], presidential candidates [[Dan Quayle]], [[John McCain]], [[Jon Huntsman Jr.|Jon Huntsman]] and [[John Kasich]]. Senators [[Jim Inhofe]], [[John Cornyn]], [[Lamar Alexander]], [[John McCain]], [[Jeff Flake]], [[Bob Corker]], [[Chuck Grassley]], [[David Perdue]], John Kennedy, [[Ben Sasse]], [[Elizabeth Dole]] and [[Paul Coverdell]]. Also governors [[Sonny Perdue]], [[Rick Snyder]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Ernie Fletcher]].

His long-shot gubernatorial campaign for [[Sonny Perdue]] in Georgia featured a video of a giant Rat rampaging Georgia. The rat portrayed the current, popular governor [[Roy Barnes]]. The video is credited as starting the movement toward viral videos in politics. Perdue beat Barnes handily, in spite of being outspent more than seven to one.

A similar campaign for now-Governor [[Rick Snyder]] of Michigan featured the unusual Davis slogan, “One Tough Nerd.” The slogan caught on across the state helping propel the unknown Snyder past several statewide office holders into a primary win without a runoff, then the general election.

He created a well-known 2010 ad for [[United States Senate special election in Delaware, 2010|U.S. Senate candidate]] [[Christine O'Donnell]] which featured her declaring she was "not a witch", in response to the re-airing of past statements made by her about her interactions with non-Christian religious practices.&lt;ref name="McGreal2010-09-20"&gt;{{cite news|last=McGreal|first=Chris|title=Christine O'Donnell: I dabbled in witchcraft|date=2010-09-20|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|location=London|url =https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/20/christine-o-donnell-dabbled-witchcraft|accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; O’Donnell’s witch statements had become a staple of late night comedy programs, including Saturday Night Live, before Davis was hired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/09/kristen-wiig-parodies-chr_n_757116.html|title='SNL' Does The Best Parody Of Christine O'Donnell's 'Not A Witch' Ad Yet|work=Huffington Post|last=McGlynn|first=Katia|date=2010-10-10|accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/20/elvira-christine-odonnell_n_770527.html|title=Elvira Spoofs Christine O'Donnell's 'I'm Not A Witch' Ad|work= Huffington Post|date=2010-10-20|accessdate=2010-12-03|first=Katla|last=McGlynn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/26/im-not-a-witch-the-remix/|title="I'm Not A Witch" — The Remix|work=The Ca10-2626-10|accessdate=2010-12-03|first=Ashley|last=Parker|date=2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Davis authored a controversial ad for Representative [[Pete Hoekstra]] for his Senate campaign against incumbent Democrat [[Debbie Stabenow]]. The ad attacked Stabenow as Debbie "Spend-it-now" and showed an Asian woman riding a bicycle in a rice paddy thanking Stabenow (in broken English) for enriching the Chinese economy at the expense of the U.S. 

Republican strategist [[Mike Murphy (political consultant)|Mike Murphy]] tweeted that the ad was "really, really dumb,"&lt;ref name="hill"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/video/senate/208793-hoekstra-super-bowl-ad-hits-debbie-spend-it-now-on-debt|title=Hoekstra defends ad against charges of racial insensitivity|author=Cameron Joseph|date=February 6, 2012|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Stabenow called it "shocking" and "nasty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/02/offensive-pete-hoekstra-ad-draws-big-bucks-for-rival-sen-debbie-stabenow/|title='Offensive' Pete Hoekstra Ad Draws Big Bucks for Rival Sen. Debbie Stabenow|author=Amy Bingham|date=February 13, 2012|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoekstra denied that the ad was insensitive to Chinese Americans and was meant to focus on Stabenow's voting record.&lt;ref name="hill" /&gt; Within two weeks, the Hoekstra campaign removed the video from his campaign website and [[YouTube]] account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/david-catanese/2012/02/hoekstra-scrubs-superbowl-ad-from-sites-115093.html|title=Hoekstra scrubs Super Bowl ad from sites|author=David Catanese|date=February 21, 2014|work=[[Politico]]|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Davis’ firm prepared a 57-page plan (commissioned by billionaire [[Joe Ricketts]]) for a $10 million campaign attempting to defeat the re-election of President Obama. It partially recycled points of criticism against Obama from the 2008 presidential campaign, including his relationship with Obama’s reverend, [[Jeremiah Wright]]. The proposal, titled, ''The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: The Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good,'' was initially approved by the Ricketts' Ending Spending Action Fund.

A copy of the proposal document was released by a person unconnected to the ad campaign to ''[[The New York Times]]'', after which it was roundly lambasted in external commentary. Ricketts then disavowed commissioning the plan. Although Davis' agency had gone at least as far as contacting [[Larry Elder]] to join the project, no ads were ever aired. Ricketts issued a statement disavowing the ad campaign hours after it was publicized by the ''New York Times.''

Other clients of Davis include [[George W. Bush]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref name="Lapowsky" /&gt;

In 1907, Adams borrowed money to rent and equip an office and launched the '''Adams Newspaper Service'''.&lt;ref&gt;"George Matthew Adams Started Syndicate on a Shoestring," ''Editor and Publisher'' (Julv 21, 1934).&lt;/ref&gt; Adams' syndicate was located at 8 West 40th Street in Manhattan. When Adams and ''[[Emporia Gazette]]'' publisher [[William Allen White]] met in [[Chicago]] in 1908, Adams hired White to write about political issues. Adams had copies of Walt Mason's light verse which he had clipped from the ''Gazette'', and said, "I like this stuff. I'd like to syndicate it to other papers. Suppose I could?" White responded, "Sure. Give Uncle Walt about $18 a week, and he'll be tickled pink to do it for you." Adams did, and as Mason's ''Rippling Rhythms'' column increased in popularity, he eventually increased Mason's salary to $15,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T3cyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YbYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5903,5882106&amp;dq=george-matthew-adams+syndicate&amp;hl=en Driscoll, C.B. "New York Day by Day", ''The Palm Beach Post'', July 16, 1939.] {{dead link|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the Adams Newspaper Service was changed in 1916 to the '''George Matthew Adams Service'''. Writers syndicated by Adams included [[Thornton Burgess]], [[Edgar Guest]] and [[Robert Ripley]]. The syndicate also distributed single-panel cartoons, including some accompanied by jokes, backwoods homilies, light verse or Adams-style inspiration. Adams syndicated comic strips, including [[Billy DeBeck]]'s ''Finn an' Haddie'', [[Percy Crosby]]'s ''The Clancy Kids'', ([[Edwina Dumm]]'s ''[[Cap Stubbs and Tippie]]'', [[Ed Wheelan]]'s ''Minute Movies'', and [[Robert Baldwin (cartoonist)|Robert Baldwin]]'s ''Freddy''. In addition to sports cartoons by [[Lank Leonard]], Adams syndicated [[Johnny Gruelle]]'s illustrated ''[[Raggedy Ann]]'' panels from 1934 to 1938. The uplifting ''Raggedy Ann'' verses emphasized forthrightness, honesty, kindness and thrift. He also syndicated Rebecca McCann's philosophical ''[[The Cheerful Cherub]]''.

[[Lloyd Jacquet]] was the syndicate's art director from c. 1936 to 1937,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=JACQUET%2c+LLOYD Lloyd Jacquet entry], ''Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928–1999''. Accessed Dec. 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; shortly before leaving to found [[Funnies, Inc.]] The syndicate's long-time manager was Giordano Bruno Pascale.&lt;ref&gt;"Who's Who Among Leading U.S. Syndicate Executives," ''Editor &amp; Publisher'' (September 7, 1946). Archived at [https://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2010/07/news-of-yore-1946-syndicate-executives.html "News of Yore 1946: Syndicate Executives Profiled,"] ''Stripper's Guide'' (July 21, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams's syndicate peaked in the 1920s and 1930s, eventually fading as its founder aged. In the company's latter years, the president and general manager was Harry E. Elmlark.&lt;ref name=Boyd /&gt;

Adams died in 1962; the remaining features were sold to The Washington Star Company in May of 1965, thus forming the [[Washington Star Syndicate]].&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;Boyd, Crosby N., President. "THE WASHINGTON STAR HAS PURCHASED THE GEORGE MATTHEW ADAMS SERVICE, A NEWSPAPER FEATURE SYNDICATE," ''The Washington Star'' (May 9, 1965).

=== Writing ===
In the 1910s, Adams was selling Dr. Frank Crane's (1861-1928) popular ''Four Minute Essays''. When he lost Crane to a competitor, he decided to write short inspirational essays himself while he traveled from city to city selling to newspapers. By the 1950s, Crane was all but forgotten, but Adams' short inspirational columns, titled  ''Today’s Talk'', were in about 100 newspapers and also collected in a series of books.&lt;ref name=day&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GC4iAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6nIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3991,2754641&amp;dq=george-matthew-adams+frank-tripp&amp;hl=en Tripp, Frank.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14431">The '''Global Industry Classification Standard''' ('''GICS''') is an [[industry taxonomy]] developed in 1999 by [[MSCI]] and [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] (S&amp;P) for use by the global financial community. The GICS structure consists of 11 sectors, 24 industry groups, 68 industries and 157 sub-industries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msci.com/resources/factsheets/MSCI_Global_Industry_Classification_Standard.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219200846/http://www.msci.com/resources/factsheets/MSCI_Global_Industry_Classification_Standard.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; into which S&amp;P has categorized all major [[public company|public companies]].  The system is similar to ICB ([[Industry Classification Benchmark]]), a classification structure maintained by FTSE Group.

GICS is used as a basis for S&amp;P and [[MSCI]] [[financial market]] indexes in which each company is assigned to a sub-industry, and to a corresponding industry, industry group and sector, according to the definition of its principal business activity. It is also considered to be the most successful as per Finch rating agency.

"GICS" is a [[registered trademark]] of [[McGraw Hill Financial]] and MSCI Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msci.com/products/indices/sector/gics |title=MSCI-Barra GICS Tables |accessdate=2013-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msci.com/products/indices/sector/gics |title=MSCI-Barra GICS Sector Definitions |accessdate=2013-02-10 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guaranteed minimum income''' ('''GMI'''), also called '''minimum income''', is a system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basicincome.org/basic-income/history History of Basic Income], ''Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN)'', retrieved on 18 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; of [[social welfare provision]] that guarantees that all [[citizen]]s or [[family|families]] have an income sufficient to live on, provided they meet certain conditions. Eligibility is typically determined by [[citizenship]], a [[means test]], and either availability for the [[labour market]] or a willingness to perform [[community service]]s. The primary goal of a guaranteed minimum income is to [[poverty reduction|reduce poverty]]. If citizenship is the only requirement, the system turns into a [[basic income|universal basic income]].

==Elements==
A system of guaranteed minimum income can consist of several elements, most notably:

* a calculation of the social minimum, usually below the [[minimum wage]];
* a [[social safety net]], to help citizens or families without sufficient financial means survive at the social minimum. This may be a transfer or, in some cases, a loan, and is generally conditional to availability for work, performance of community services, some kind of [[social contract]], or commitment to a [[Social integration|reintegration]] trajectory;
* [[child support]] by the [[state (polity)|state]];
* [[student loan]] and [[grants]];
* [[state pension]] for the elderly;
* [[disability pension]] for the persons with disability.

==Differences from basic income==
{{Main|Basic income}}

Basic income means the provision of identical payments from a government to all of its citizens. Guaranteed minimum income is a system of payments (possibly only one) by a government to citizens who fail to meet one or more [[means test]]s. While most modern countries have some form of GMI, a basic income is rare.

==Advocates==
The first Muslim [[caliph]], [[Abu Bakr]], introduced a guaranteed minimum standard of income, granting each man, woman, and child ten [[dirhams]] annually; this was later increased to twenty dirhams.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Clark: Pakistan's Zakat and 'Ushr as a Welfare System&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795, American revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]] advocated a [[citizen's dividend]] to all [[United States]] citizens as compensation for "loss of his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property" (''[[Agrarian Justice]]'', 1795).

French [[Emperor]] [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] echoed Paine's sentiments and commented that 'man is entitled by birthright to a share of the Earth's produce sufficient to fill the needs of his existence' (Herold, 1955).

The [[United States|American]] [[economist]] [[Henry George]] advocated for a dividend to be paid to all citizens from the revenue generated by a [[land value tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= George|first= Henry|date= 1871|title= Our Land and Land Policy, National and State|url= https://archive.org/details/ourlandandlandp00georgoog|location= |publisher= White &amp; Bauer [etc.]|page= 230|isbn= 9781230444703|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, [[Robert Theobald]] published the book ''Free Men and Free Markets'', in which he advocated a ''guaranteed minimum income'' (the origin of the modern version of the phrase).

In 1966, the [[Cloward–Piven strategy]] advocated "overloading" the US welfare system to force its collapse in the hopes that it would be replaced by "a guaranteed annual income and thus an end to poverty".

In his final book ''[[Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?]]'' (1967), [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] wrote&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther King jr., ''[[Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?]]'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{"|I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective—the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.|from the chapter titled "Where We Are Going"}}

In 1968, [[James Tobin]], [[Paul Samuelson]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and another 1,200 economists signed a document calling for the US Congress to introduce in that year a system of income guarantees and supplements.&lt;ref&gt;''Economists' Statement on Guaranteed Annual Income'', 1/15/1968-4/18/1969 folder, General Correspondence Series, Papers of John Kenneth Galbraith, John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. Cited in: Jyotsna Sreenivasan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yk5NI69ZO9sC "Poverty and the Government in America: A Historical Encyclopedia."] (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2009), page 269&lt;/ref&gt;

President Richard Nixon proposed reforms to the welfare program in 1969, where a minimum income would be paid to poor families. Contrary to popular belief, Nixon was critical of the idea of a guaranteed universal basic income. The proposal by Nixon passed in the House but never made it out of committee in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=2194|title=Richard Nixon: Special Message to the Congress on Reform of the Nation's Welfare System.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] wrote ''The Politics of a Guaranteed Income'', in which he advocated the guaranteed minimum income and discussed [[Richard Nixon]]'s Guaranteed Annual Income (GAI) proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=2191|title=Richard Nixon: Address to the Nation on Domestic Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, [[New Zealand]]'s [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] Finance Minister [[Roger Douglas]] announced a Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Scheme to accompany a new flat tax.  Both were quashed by then Prime Minister [[David Lange]], who sacked Douglas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DE133CF937A15751C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "New Zealand Is Jolted By a Speedy Decontrol"], Seth Mydans, ''The New York Times'' (24 February 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1994 "autobiographical dialog", [[classical liberal]] [[Friedrich Hayek]] stated: "I have always said that I am in favor of a minimum income for every person in the country".&lt;ref&gt;Hayek on Hayek: An Autobiographical Dialogue by F. A. Hayek, edited by Stephen Kresge and Leif Wenar (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, The Equal Life Foundation published the Living Income Guaranteed Proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/182616757/The-Living-Income-Guaranteed-Proposal|title=The Living Income Guaranteed Proposal}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating a practical way to implement and fund a minimum guaranteed income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livingincome.me/wiki/The_Living_Income_Guaranteed_Proposal|title=The Living Income Guaranteed Proposal|work=Living Income Guaranteed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Harry A. Shamir (US) published a book "Consumerism, or Capitalism Without Crises" in which the concept was promoted by another label, as a way to enable our civilization to survive in an era of automation and computerization and large scale unemployment.  The book also innovates a method to fund the process, tapping into the underground economy and volunteerism.

Other modern advocates include [[Hans-Werner Sinn]] (Germany), [[Ayşe Buğra]] (Turkey), The Green Economics Institute (GEI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greeneconomics.org.uk|title=Green Economics|publisher=GEI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrew Coyne]] (Canada).&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/2013/04/08/a-minimum-income-not-wage-is-a-fairer-way-to-distribute-wealth/ "A minimum income, not wage, is a fairer way to distribute wealth"], Andrew Coyne, ''The Financial Post'' (8 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
{{refimprove section |date=December 2013}}

Tax revenues would fund the majority of any GMI proposal. As most GMI proposals seek to create an earnings floor close to or above poverty lines amongst all citizens, the fiscal burden would require equally broad tax sources, such as income taxes or VATs, in order to fund such expenditures. To varying degrees, a GMI might be funded through the reduction or elimination of other social security programs such as [[unemployment insurance]].

Another approach for funding is to acknowledge that all modern economies use fiat money and thus taxation is not necessary for funding; However, the fact that there are no financial constraints does not mean other constraints, such as on real resources, do not exist. A likely outcome based on the economic theory known as [[Modern Monetary Theory]] would be a moderate increase in taxation to ensure the extra income would not cause demand-pull inflation; This hypothetical [[Chartalism|Chartalist]] approach can be seen in the implementation of [[quantitative easing]] programs where, in the United States, over three trillion dollars&lt;ref&gt;[https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?g=2pXx Fredgraph]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7Xh0hY3-sM&amp;t=0m8s|title=Ben Bernanke: As a Literal Fact the Fed is not Printing Money|first=|last=wonkmonk|date=12 May 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; were created without requiring taxes.

==Examples around the world==

===Cyprus===
In July 2013, the Cypriot government unveiled a plan to reform the welfare system in Cyprus and create a {{'}}''Guaranteed Minimum Income''{{'}} for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2013/07/26/president-announces-guaranteed-minimum-income-for-all-citizens/|title=President announces 'Guaranteed Minimum Income' for all citizens|work=Cyprus Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In 1988, France was one of the first countries to implement a minimum income, called the [[Revenu minimum d'insertion]]. In 2009, it was turned into [[Revenu de solidarité active]] (RSA), a new system which aimed at solving the [[poverty trap]] by providing low-wage workers a complementary income; thus encouraging activity.

The [[United States]] has multiple social programs that provide guaranteed minimum incomes for individuals meeting certain criteria such as assets or disability. For instance, [[Supplemental Security Income]] ('''SSI''') is a United States government program that provides [[stipend]]s to low-income people who are either aged (65 or older), blind, or disabled. SSI was created in 1974 to replace federal-state adult assistance programs that served the same purpose. Today the program provides benefits to approximately eight million Americans. Another such program is [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] ('''SSD''' or '''SSDI'''), a [[payroll tax]]-funded, [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|federal insurance]] program.  It is managed by the [[Social Security Administration]] and is designed to provide [[income supplement]]s to people who are physically restricted in their ability to be [[employed]] because of a notable [[disability]], usually a [[physical disability]]. SSD can be supplied on either a temporary or permanent basis, usually directly correlated to whether the person's disability is temporary or permanent.

An early guaranteed minimum income program in the U.S. was the&amp;nbsp;[[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]]&amp;nbsp;(AFDC), established by the&amp;nbsp;[[Social Security Act]]. Where previously the responsibility to assist needy children lay in the hands of the states, AFDC transferred that authority to the federal government.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lurie|first=Irene|date=1997-01-01|title=Temporary Assistance for Needy Families: A Green Light for the States|url=https://academic.oup.com/publius/article/27/2/73/1916654|journal=Publius: The Journal of Federalism|volume=27|issue=2|pages=73–87|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubjof.a029915|issn=0048-5950}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Over time, the AFDC was often criticized for creating disincentives to work, leading to many arguing for its replacement. In the 1970s, President&amp;nbsp;[[Richard Nixon|Richard M. Nixon]]&amp;nbsp;proposed the Family Assistance Program (FAP) which would replace the AFDC. FAP was designed to fix many of the problems that the AFDC suffered from, particularly the anti-work structure. Presidential nominee&amp;nbsp;[[George McGovern]]&amp;nbsp;also proposed a minimum income in the form of a Universal Tax Credit. Ultimately, neither of these programs were implemented. Throughout the decade, many other experimental minimum income programs were carried out in cities throughout the country, such as the Seattle-Denver Income Maintenance Experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larson|first=David|date=January 1, 1992|title=Long Overdue: The Single Guaranteed Minimum Income Program|url=|journal=University of Detroit Mercy Law Review.|volume= 69|pages=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;In 1996, under President&amp;nbsp;[[Bill Clinton]], the AFDC was replaced with the&amp;nbsp;[[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]]&amp;nbsp;program. This would&amp;nbsp;[[block grant]]&amp;nbsp;funds to the states to allow them to decide how aid would be distributed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another guaranteed minimum income program in the U.S. is the&amp;nbsp;[[Earned income tax credit|Earned Income Tax Credit.]]&amp;nbsp;This is a refundable tax credit that gives poorer families cash assistance every year. The EITC avoids the&amp;nbsp;[[welfare trap]]&amp;nbsp;by subsidizing income, rather than replacing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zelleke|first=Almaz|date=December 2005|title=Basic Income in the United States: Redefining Citizenship in the Liberal State|url=|journal=Review of Social Economy|volume= 63|pages=633–648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
Minimum income has been increasingly accepted by the Brazilian government. In 2004, President&amp;nbsp;[[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]] signed into law a bill to establish a universal basic income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wispelaere|first=Jurgen De|date=October 2016|title=Basic Income in Our Time: Improving Political Prospects Through Policy Learning?|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-social-policy/article/basic-income-in-our-time-improving-political-prospects-through-policy-learning/C69074D813A9FE5096E60718131ACAD6|journal=Journal of Social Policy|volume=45|issue=4|pages=617–634|doi=10.1017/s0047279416000039|issn=0047-2794|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;This law is primarily implemented through the&amp;nbsp;[[Bolsa Família]]&amp;nbsp;program. Under this program, poorer families will receive a direct cash payment via a government issued debit card. Bolsa Família is a&amp;nbsp;[[conditional cash transfer]]&amp;nbsp;program, meaning that beneficiaries will receive their aid if they accomplish certain actions. Families who receive the aid must put their children in school and participate in vaccination programs. If they do not meet these requirements, they will be cut off from aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/10650663|title=Happy families|date=2008-02-07|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-30|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;As of 2011, approximately 50 million people, or a quarter of Brazil's population, were participating in Bolsa Família.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/brazil/overview#2|title=Overview|work=World Bank|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Canada has experimented with minimum income trials, both in the past and in the present. The most prominent past example is the&amp;nbsp;[[Mincome]]&amp;nbsp;experiment, which ran in&amp;nbsp;[[Manitoba]]&amp;nbsp;in the 1970s. Mincome provided lower income families with cash transfers to keep them out of poverty. The researchers conducting Mincome found that it did not disincentivize work. The only recipients who reduced their number of hours worked were single mothers, who could now afford to stay at home and raise their children, and young men who preferred to stay in school rather than work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/2001-odyssee-espace/a-guaranteed-annual-income-from-mincome-to-the-millennium/|title=A guaranteed annual income? From moncome to millennium|work=Policy Options|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Budget shortfalls resulted in the shuttering of the program.

In 2017, the province of&amp;nbsp;[[Ontario]]&amp;nbsp;began an minimum income experiment. Approximately 4000 citizens began to receive a stipend based on their family situation and income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/24/pf/canada-ontario-money-basic-income-program/index.html|title=Canada: Ontario launches guaranteed income program for 4,000 residents|last=Petroff|first=Alanna|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Recipients of this program can receive upwards of $10,000 per year. Government researchers are using this pilot as a way of testing to see if a minimum income can help people meet their basic needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-basic-income-pilot|title=Ontario Basic Income Pilot|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ontario.ca|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erik Gustaf Larson''' (8 July 1887 – 4 July 1968) was a Swedish [[automotive engineer]] and the co-founder of [[Volvo]]. He held a Master of Science (M. Sc.) degree in [[Mechanical Engineering]] from the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm.

==Biography==
Larson was responsible for the technical design of the first Volvo model [[Volvo ÖV 4|ÖV 4]], introduced on 14 April 1927. He and [[Assar Gabrielsson]] founded Volvo. He was appointed vice president and technical manager for AB [[Volvo]] in Gothenburg, from the time the company was founded 1927. He worked for Volvo until his death in 1968.

===Invention and development===
In June 1924 when Gustav Larson met his old friend [[Assar Gabrielsson]] in Stockholm, Gabrielsson unveiled his plans to try to establish the manufacturing of a new Swedish automobile. Gustav Larson had worked for SKF between 1917-1919 but now worked for the company AB Galco in Stockholm. They made a verbal agreement in August 1924 at the [[Sturehof]] restaurant in Stockholm, then signed a written contract more than one year later, on 16 December 1925. In this contract Gustav was to carry out the engineering work for a new car, as well as an investment plan for a complete new manufacturing plant, but would only be rewarded for that work in case the project would turn out well. Well meant after at least 100 produced cars and in the case this was achieved before 1 January 1928. This famous contract shows that Assar Gabrielsson "owned" the project and that it was a high-risk project without any guarantees. Gabrielsson took the economic risks himself and Gustav, in the worst case, would have worked on the project without being rewarded, but still would have had his salary from AB Galco in Stockholm. Most of the capital that Gabrielsson intended to use for the project initially was actually extra sales commissions that he had saved from the time he was the [[managing director]] for the SKF subsidiary in [[Paris]] in 1921-22.
 
Gabrielsson had  decided to build a test series of ten vehicles with his own financing and later present the car and an entire investment plan to SKF. The idea to build a pre-series of ten vehicles was most certainly related to the fact that no company would have given he and Larsen an offer for the components (engines, gearboxes, chassis components etc.) With less quantity they were certain that SKF would approve plans in due time. Engineering, documentation and investment planning was carried out exactly in the same way, as if it had been carried out by SKF in order to prepare for the set up of a new automobile company. Gabrielsson most certainly had the full support from the managing director of SKF, Mr. [[Björn Prytz]], at that time, as long as his 'private' project did not interfere with his work as sales manager for SKF.

The first ten pre-series vehicles, model [[Volvo ÖV 4|ÖV 4]], were designed and assembled in Stockholm at AB Galco under the supervision of Gustav Larson, at that time still having his other work at AB Galco to attend to. A "design-office", often called "Volvo's first design-office", was established in one room of Larson's private apartment at [[Rådmansgatan]] 59. The design work started in the autumn of 1924 and a number of engineers were involved, among them engineer [[Jan G. Smith]], that had returned from America in 1924, and later engineer Henry Westerberg. All the invoices related to the project was sent to Gabrielsson's private address at Kungsportsavenyn 32 in Gothenburg. In a lot of orders that Gustav Larsson made himself, he referred to Gabrielsson as a "guarantee" so that the deliveries would be paid by him personally. These details shows that the Volvo automobile project in the beginning was a true private project, not sponsored by SKF from an economic point of view.

The first prototype car was ready in June 1926. Larsen and Gabrielsson took it and drove themselves, on bumpy roads, down to SKF in Gothenburg to show the SKF-board and now present the final investment plan.

===AB Volvo founded ===
At a board meeting held in [[Hofors]], Sweden on 10 August 1926, SKF decided to use the old subsidiary company Volvo AB, for the automobile project. AB Volvo, that was first registered in 1915 on the initiative of Björn Prytz, was originally set up to be used for a special series of ball bearings for the American market but it was never really used for this purpose. A small series of ball bearings stamped with Volvo was manufactured but it was never introduced on a larger scale.

A contract was signed on 12 August 1926 between SKF and Gabrielsson, stipulating that all ten prototype cars, engineering drawings, calculations etc. should be handed over to Volvo AB, and Gabrielsson in return would be refunded most of his private investments for the prototype cars.  The contract was signed by [[Björn Prytz]], managing director of SKF and Gabrielsson. Gustaf Larsson finally got paid for the initial engineering work with the ÖV4 according to the 'private' contract he and Gabrielsson had signed on 16 December 1925. That 1925 contract had stated that the automobile project may be sold to any company that would be interested, but they hoped that SKF would be the company to first offer.

Gustav Larson was appointed vice president and technical manager on 1 January 1927, and left his employment at AB Galco in Stockholm.

=== First production Volvo===
On 14 April 1927, at about 10 p.m., the first series production model, the [[Volvo ÖV 4|ÖV 4]], left the newly established factory on [[Hisingen]] in [[Gothenburg]].

The ten prototype cars that had been assembled in Stockholm were never sold, except for one that was sold to Volvo's photographer Sven Sjöstedt and was later donated to the [[Volvo Museum|Volvo Industrial Museum]] around 1930. However it was used as transportation vehicles within the manufacturing plant and as 'test benches' for new developed components during the first years.

=== Economic problems ===
The new company did not show any profit for the first couple of years and SKF invested more money to keep the company running. In 1928 the production of [[truck]]s began with the basic chassis components from ÖV4. The production of trucks was on a small scale, but the concept was successful from start.

However, in late 1929 SKF nearly sold the company to [[Charles W. Nash|Charles Nash]], president of [[Nash Motors]] in the [[United States]]. Björn Prytz and Gabrielsson managed to convince the SKF board to call the deal off, just one day before Charles Nash arrived by boat in [[Gothenburg]].  At the end of 1930 AB Volvo showed a small profit for the first time. In 1935 SKF came to the conclusion that Volvo now was ready to stand on its own feet. Volvo was introduced on the [[Stockholm stock exchange]] and SKF sold most of its shares. SKF could now concentrate on their core business, development and manufacturing of bearings, and still are, more than 100 years after the company was founded in 1907.

=== Sales success ===
In 1941, the 50,000th Volvo car was delivered. It took ten years to produce the first 25,000 cars but only four years for the next 25,000 cars. In 1944-45, just after the end of the [[Second World War]], the modern styled family car [[PV444]], with a completely new design, was introduced and the car was a sales success. The company now stood on solid ground and the production of both cars and trucks continued to increase for the rest of Larsen's life.

==Family==
Gustaf Larson was married to Elin Octavia Fröberg in 1918. They had four children: Erik, Anders, Gunnel, and Britt.

Gustaf Larson died on 4 July 1968, and is buried at the family tomb in [[Båstad]], Sweden.

Until 1980, Roschier competed in [[alpine skiing]], winning several medals in Finnish championships. He won the [[giant slalom]] in 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Roschier sai ensimmäisen SM:n suurpujottelussa | journal=Skimbaaja | volume=3 | issue=3 | pages=33 | year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Alppilajien SM-kilpailut | journal=Skimbaaja | volume=4 | issue=3 | pages=60 | year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 he went on to become the managing director of the Finnish alpine ski magazine [[Skimbaaja]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Skimbaaja 1977–1987 | journal=Skimbaaja | volume=11 | issue=7 | pages=64 | year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which he even acted as the editor-in-chief in 1989. After selling the publishing company to [[Sanoma]] Oyj, he worked for some time for the special interest title publishing unit within Sanoma, before becoming the CEO of a public company at 35. Roschier is still an active skier and passionate competitive sailor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Volvo Espoo-Suursaari Race 2005 | url=http://www.espoosuursaarirace.org/tulokset/2005/ims1final2005.htm | date=12 June 2005 | accessdate=8 July 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726034843/http://www.espoosuursaarirace.org/tulokset/2005/ims1final2005.htm | archivedate=26 July 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[H-boat]] class and with his 45-footer Luna. In 2012 a syndicate headed by Roschier launched Luna a [[8mR]] replica based on drawings by [[Charles E. Nicholson]]  from 1936. Luna came second in the 8 metre worlds in 2012 in Cowes.

'''''Investor's Business Daily''''' ('''''IBD''''') is an American newspaper and website covering the stock market, [[international business]], [[finance]] and [[economics]]. Founded in 1984 by [[William O'Neil]] as a print news publication, it is headquartered in [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref name="wallstreet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-business-daily-will-become-a-weekly-1457131255|title=Investor's Business Daily Will Become a Weekly|author=Lukas Alpert |publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=4 March 2016|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holding a [[conservative]] political stance, ''IBD'' provides news and analysis on [[stock]]s, [[mutual fund]]s, [[exchange-traded fund|ETFs]], [[commodities]], and other financial instruments aimed at individual investors and financial professionals.&lt;ref name =tbiz/&gt;

In March, 2016, the company announced that ''IBD'' would become a weekly publication and would focus more on digital operations.&lt;ref name=folio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2016/investors-business-daily-reduces-print-schedule/|title=Investor's Business Daily Reduces Print Schedule|publisher=Folio Magazine|author=Greg Dool |date=7 March 2016 |accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication will continue to use the ''Investor's Business Daily'' name as it will continue to publish daily on its website.&lt;ref name=tbiz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talkingbiznews.com/1/investors-business-daily-to-become-a-weekly-20-news-jobs-to-be-cut/|title=Investor's Business Daily to Become a Weekly, 20 News Jobs to be Cut|publisher=Talking Biz News|author=Chris Roush |date=4 March 2016 |accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, the company officially switched to a weekly print publishing schedule and published its first issue of ''IBD Weekly'' while continuing to update its website daily.&lt;ref name=tb2 &gt;{{cite web|url=http://talkingbiznews.com/1/explaining-the-changes-at-investors-business-daily/|title=Explaining the Changes at Investor's Business Daily|publisher=Talking Biz News|author=Chris Roush|date=May 9, 2016|access-date=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Investor's Business Daily (front page).jpg|220px|right]]
Entrepreneur and stockbroker [[William O'Neil]] founded the newspaper in 1984 due to frustration with the lack of data about stocks in newspapers.&lt;ref name=tbiz/&gt; In 1991, the publication's name was changed from ''Investor's Daily'' to ''Investor's Business Daily''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/4058903-warren-buffett-influential-investor-time|title=How Warren Buffett Is Not The Most Influential Investor of Our Time|work=Seeking Alpha|date=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, ten years after its founding, ''IBD'' was ranked among the fastest-growing newspapers in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-20/news/we-13561_1_investor-s-business-daily|title=Media: Financial Paper Closing In on Bottom Line |publisher=Los Angeles Times |author=Greg Krikorian|date=20 January 1994|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the political cartoonist [[Michael Ramirez]] joined ''IBD''.  In 2008, Ramirez won his second Pulitzer for editorial cartooning while at the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/07/business/media/07cnd-pulitzers.html?_r=0|title=Washington Post Wins 6 Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=The New York Times |author=Richard Perez-Pena |date=7 April 2008|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the ''IBD'' website was accessed by over 4 million monthly visitors.&lt;ref name = tbiz/&gt; In 2016, it was announced that the company would change its printing schedule to once a week, but continue to publish new content to its website daily.&lt;ref name=wallstreet/&gt; In May 2016, the first issue of ''IBD Weekly'' was published while the media outlet continued to publish new digital content daily.&lt;ref name =tb2/&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election in the U.S.]], ''IBD'' was one of two polls that consistently showed [[Donald Trump]] in the lead. Leading up to the election, ''IBD's'' poll was correctly dismissed as being an "outlying survey" and in the end missed the final popular vote tally by four percentage points in Trump's favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/bad-polling-in-hand-media-misses-mark-badly-with-election-predictions-1478710860|title=How the Media's Election Predictions Badly Missed the Mark|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|first1=Joe|last1=Flint|first2=Lukas|last2=Alpert|date=November 9, 2016|access-date=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/09/how-two-polls-predicted-trumps-surprise-victory.html|title=How Two Polls Predicted Trump's Surprise Victory|publisher=Fox News|date=November 9, 2016|access-date=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
''IBD'' takes a conservative political stance in its news and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;John Atlas, ''Seeds of Change: The Story of ACORN, America's Most Controversial Antipoverty Community Organizing Group'' (Vanderbilt University Press, 2010), p. 297: "In 2007, ''Investor's Business Daily'', a conservative business newspaper, repeated more misrepresentations."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Frantzich, ''The C-SPAN Revolution'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1996), p. 321:"After years of frustration with what they perceived as the liberal commercial media, conservative sources gloated after the 1994 election. An editorial in ''Investor's Business Daily'' argued..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John K. Wilson, ''Barack Obama: This Improbable Quest'' (Routledge, 2009), p. 209: "The conservative ''Investor's Business Daily'' editorialized..."&lt;/ref&gt; ''IBD'' provides investor education through its Investor's Corner, the Big Picture, and online resources. The information provided expands on William O'Neil's previous books that detail the [[CAN SLIM]] investment strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/conversation-with-a-maverick-investor-2011-09-13|title=Conversation With a Maverick Investor|publisher=MarketWatch |author=Kevin Marder |date=13 September 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''IBD'' includes several written sections that detail companies and news of interest. It covers internet and technology stocks in particular, and has a substantial editorial and opinion section. Every Monday in its weekly edition, ''IBD'' publishes a list of 50 stocks that are most attractive based on earnings, stock price performance, and other criteria used in the CAN SLIM strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/02/23/oneil-ibd-canslim-personal-finance_william_oneil.html|title=Breaking Out With Bill O'Neill |publisher=Forbes |author=John Dobosz |date=23 February 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IBD 50 ===
'''''The IBD 50 Index''''' is the flagship US stock market benchmark published by the Investor’s Business Daily, similar to how [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE 100]] was to the [[Financial Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/|title=Stock Lists 50 {{!}} Investor's Business Daily|work=Investor's Business Daily|access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://research.investors.com/stock-charts/nyse-i-b-d-50-index-0ibd5.htm?cht=null&amp;type=daily|title=I B D 50 Index - Stock Investment Research, IBD Stock Charts|work=Investor's Business Daily|access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The index is based on the CAN SLIM methodology invented by the newspaper’s founder William O’Neil, and the list of its constituents is published every Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://education.investors.com/financial-dictionary/ibd-tools/ibd-rgr--50-index|title=IBD® 50 Index {{!}} Financial Terms Key Terms University|work=Investor's Business Daily|access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later it becomes the basis for an [[exchange-traded fund]] (ETF) called the '''Innovator IBD 50 ETF''' (Ticker: FFTY), which is also rebalanced weekly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://innovatoretfs.com/|title=Innovator ETFs|website=Innovator ETFs|access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Errors and retractions==
In July 2009, an editorial in ''Investor's Business Daily'' claimed that physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] "wouldn't have a chance in the U.K., where the [British] [[National Health Service]] (NHS) would say the life of this brilliant man, because of his physical handicaps, is essentially worthless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Robertson| first = Lori| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = How to Not Prove a Point| work = FactCheck.org| publisher = Annenberg Public Policy Center| date = August 13, 2009| url = http://www.factcheck.org/2009/08/how-to-not-prove-a-point/| format = | doi = | accessdate = 12 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawking was British, lived in the [[United Kingdom]] nearly all of his life, and received his medical care from the NHS.  ''IBD'' later removed the editorial's reference to Hawking in its online version and appended an "Editor's Note" which said, "This version corrects the original editorial which implied that physicist Stephen Hawking, a professor at the University of Cambridge, did not live in the UK."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/12/hawking_british_and_alive/|title=Obama health reform critics face inconvenient truth|date=2009-08-12|accessdate=2014-08-14|publisher=[[The Register]]|last=Metz|first=Cade}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = [[The Washington Post]] | first = Ezra | last = Klein | title = How Stephen Hawking Proves That Investor's Business Daily's Editorial Page Tells Lies | url = http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/08/how_stehpen_hawking_proves_tha.html | date = August 10, 2009 | accessdate = August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawking himself responded, "I wouldn't be here today if it were not for the NHS.  I have received a large amount of high-quality treatment without which I would not have survived."&lt;ref&gt;Damien McElroy, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6017878/Stephen-Hawking-I-would-not-be-alive-without-the-NHS.html Stephen Hawking: I would not be alive without the NHS], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (August 12, 2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5389">'''Liban M. Hussein''' ({{lang-so|Liibaan Xuseen}}, {{lang-ar|لبنان حسين}}) (born in [[Somalia]]) is a [[Canadian citizen|Canadian]] entrepreneur and businessman. He was a stakeholder in the [[Al-Barakat]] money transfer firm. In November 2001, Hussein was arrested at the request of the [[United States]] government, which accused him of supporting terrorism through the company. His assets were also frozen. Hussein was eventually exonerated of the charges and released, after a court found that neither the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) nor the U.S.A authorities were able to provide any evidence of terrorist links.&lt;ref name="pays"&gt;[[CanWest]], "Canada: Government pay out of court settlement to falsely accused "terrorist" suspect", October 2, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,38272,00.html Arrests made throughout US], November 7, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, all charges against the Al-Barakat Group of Companies were also dropped.&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt;

==Businesses==
Hussein ran two businesses in [[Ottawa]], Ontario. The first was a cleaning company, which he started to offer his family employment and improve their chances of successful immigration to Canada.&lt;ref name="loome"&gt;Loome, Jeremy. [[Ottawa Sun]], "Security legislation: a double-edged sword", September 12, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The second was a ''[[hawala]]'', a form of informal money transfer business, named ''Barakaat North America Inc.'' Hussein and his brother ran the latter business out of [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]], [[Massachusetts]].

==Arrest==
When it was announced that [[al-Qaeda]] was believed to have ties to the Somali money transfer service, [[Al-Barakat]], which Hussein contracted, his brother was arrested in Boston. The cleaning [[Franchising|franchise]] also revoked Hussein's license.&lt;ref name="loome"/&gt;&lt;ref name="counterterrorism"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hocking |first1=Jenny |last2=Lewis |first2=Colleen |date=2007 |title=Counter-terrorism and the Post-democratic State |url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=ItgXW8MQCjAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing Limited |pages=86–87 |isbn=9781845429171 |access-date=10 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States]] listed Al-Barakat as a terrorist entity, along with Hussein and his brother. The [[Canadian government]] also followed suit and labelled Hussein, his brother and their company as terrorists, without conducting its independent investigation. The [[United Nations Security Council]] also listed Hussein as a terrorist and froze all his assets.&lt;ref name="counterterrorism" /&gt;

Hussein went to the Ottawa police department, where he was arrested on November 7, 2001 by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] at the request of the [[United States]] government.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;[[CBC News|CBC]], "[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2001/11/12/hawala_arrest011112.html Ottawa man wanted in U.S. arrested by RCMP]", November 12, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; A court later released him on bail, as no evidence of terrorist links had been produced.&lt;ref name="counterterrorism" /&gt; Hussein was later represented by lawyer [[Michael Edelson]].&lt;ref name="kerry"&gt;Pither, Kerry. "Dark Days: The Story of Four Canadians Tortured in the Name of Fighting Terror", 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exoneration==
On June 3, 2002, seven months after Hussein was originally listed as a terrorist, the Canadian government announced that it had been shown "no evidence" suggesting that he was linked to terrorism, and that charges would therefore be dropped.&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;[[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], "[http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/news-nouv/nr-cp/2002/doc_30513.html Canada Halts Extradition Process, Liban Hussein De-Listed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614042520/http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/news-nouv/nr-cp/2002/doc_30513.html |date=2011-06-14 }}, June 3, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Hussein's name was subsequently removed from the Canadian list of individuals supporting terrorism, and later off of the American and United Nations lists as well, after the Canadian government sought his de-listing there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Canada Gazette]] Part II, [http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p2/2002/2002-06-04-x/pdf/g2-136x8.pdf Vol. 136, No. 8, Extra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321012101/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p2/2002/2002-06-04-x/pdf/g2-136x8.pdf |date=2012-03-21 }}, June 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil Liberties Association of Ottawa was quoted in newspapers that "the government destroyed this man's life without a single shred of evidence".&lt;ref name="pays"/&gt; Hussein subsequently reached a monetary settlement with the Canadian government for an undisclosed amount, and has since remained out of the public eye.&lt;ref name="counterterrorism" /&gt; In February 2012, the charges against Al-Barakat were also dropped, and all 17 entities associated with the Al-Barakat Group of Companies were removed from the UN Security Council al-Qaida Sanctions Committee's list, including the Barakat Bank of Somalia, Al-Barakat Exchange and Barakat Telecommunications Company.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/sc10549.doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4317">'''Oldřich Klimecký''' (* 16 February 1940) [[Entrepreneurship|Czech entrepreneur]], [[researcher]], [[Management|manager]], and former director of Mostecká uhelná společnost.

== Career ==
After graduating from [[Technical University of Ostrava|VSB-Technical University of Ostrava]] (VSB-TUO), he spent most of his life devoted to [[Brown coal|brown-coal mining]] research in then [[Czechoslovakia]]. At VSB-TUO he also earned the academic title of CSc (a Doctoral-equivalent degree). After the [[Velvet Revolution]] in November 1989, he became the director of the Brown Coal Research Institute (Výzkumný ústav pro hnědé uhlí) in Most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.ihned.cz/c1-60034470-mostecka-uhelna-svycarsko-soud|title=Kauza Mostecká uhelná, dějství druhé: Soud si předvolal absentéry Koláčka a Klimeckého|first=|last=ČTK|date=9 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade began to address the very poor situation at Mostecká uhelná společnost (MUS) in 1995, it started looking for a new CEO for the mining company. The winner of the selection procedure was Oldřich Klimecký, who was tasked with restructuring MUS as quickly as possible, so that for the future Czech power supply, mining would continue on prospective sites only and end everywhere else.

Upon agreement with the representatives of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the National Property Fund, the regions and major shareholders, all of whom were members of the Board of Directors of MUS, Oldřich Klimecký initiated fundamental changes in the management of the entire company and the company’s transition to a [[market economy]]. In cooperation with the new management of MUS, he created new economic and business rules for MUS and succeeded in stabilising MUS within a few short years and securing its future.

Oldřich Klimecký has long been interest in the development of the entire Most region and has supported the development of the municipalities located there. Under his direction, MUS provided financial support in the tens of millions of crowns. He was also greatly involved in the construction of the Hippodrome, which was built on former mining dumps. The [[Hippodrome]] project in Most, which is part of the Velebudice land rehabilitation park, is one of the most important projects of the Czech land rehabilitation school.&lt;ref name="penize.cz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rejstrik.penize.cz/oldrich-klimecky|title=Oldřich Klimecký, 7. 2. 2017 - Obchodní rejstřík - Peníze.cz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oldřich Klimecký has also long been engaged in politics in the Most region. He became a member of the Most municipal council in 1994, representing ODS. Oldřich Klimecký still lives in Most, now as a retiree and is no longer involved in either business or politics.&lt;ref name="penize.cz"/&gt;

== MUS case ==
In October 2013, he was sentenced to 37 months in prison by the [[Swiss]] court of first instance in [[Bellinzona]] for fraud and money laundering in connection with Appian’s purchase of a minority package of MUS shares from the Czech government in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/246882-kraus-mus-jsme-nevytunelovali-ale-zachranili/?mobileRedirect=off|title=Kraus: MUS jsme nevytunelovali, ale zachránili|first=Česká|last=televize|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his advanced age and poor health, he has not attended any of the court hearings, always using the possibility to be represented by an [[Attorney at law|attorney]]. As all of his assets and even part of his old-age pension have been seized in the Czech Republic due to the criminal proceedings, he has to be represented by an attorney appointed to him ex officio. After 15 years of continuous investigation, Oldřich Klimecký has given up on justice, lives a secluded life, does not comment on the case and does not communicate with the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/zpravy/politika/_zprava/oldrich-klimecky-se-nedostavil-ke-svycarskemu-soudu-v-kauze-mus-je-doma-v-moste--1211768|title=Oldřich Klimecký se nedostavil ke švýcarskému soudu v kauze MUS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6538">In [[business]] or [[commerce]], an '''order''' is a stated intention, either spoken or written, to engage in a commercial transaction for specific products or services. From a buyer's point of view it expresses the intention to buy and is called a [[purchase order]]. From a seller's point of view it expresses the intention to sell and is referred to as a [[Sales Order|sales order]]. When the purchase order of the buyer and the sales order of the seller agree, the orders become a [[contract]] between the buyer and seller.

Within an organization, the term order may be used to refer to a [[work order]] for manufacturing, a [[preventive maintenance]] order, or an order to make repairs to a facility.

In many businesses, orders are used to collect and report [[cost]]s and [[revenue]]s according to well-defined purposes. Then it is possible to show for what purposes costs have been incurred.

==Spoken orders==
Businesses such as [[retail store]]s, [[restaurant]]s and [[filling station]]s conduct business with their customers by accepting orders that are spoken or implied by the buyer's actions. Taking a shopping cart of merchandise to a check-out counter is an implied intent to buy the merchandise. Placing a [[take-out]] or eat-in order at a restaurant is a spoken purchase order. Putting gasoline in one's tank at a filling station is an implied order. The seller usually expects immediate payment by cash, check or credit card for these purchases, and the seller provides the buyer with a receipt for the payment. In legal terms, this form of business order is an "[[implied in fact contract]]".

==Steps in commercial orders==
In commerce, various business documents are used to record the negotiation of an agreement to buy and sell, record the agreement itself, and record compliance with the agreement and closure of the contract. An agreement to buy and sell is a form of contract.

There are five basic requirements for a contract to exist between two parties: agreement, voluntary, consideration, capacity, and legality. A sixth requirement of "in writing" sometimes applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mallor |first=Jane P. |author2=A. James Barnes |author3=Thomas Bowers |author4=Michael J. Phillips |author5=Arlen W. Langvardt  |title=Business Law and the Regulatory Environment: Concepts and Cases |publisher=Irwin/McGraw-Hill |year=1998 |pages=175 |isbn=0-256-19716-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main concern for commercial orders is that there must be '''agreement''' (offer and acceptance) for the order to be a contract. Prior to this, businesses often record the details of negotiations by using a [[request for quotation]], request for bid, sales quotation, or sales bid. Quotations are non-binding and part of the negotiation process. A request for bid can be binding or non-binding, depending on the terms of the bid.{{citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Once an agreement or contract is in place, businesses record these as confirmed purchase orders and confirmed sales orders.{{citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Uniform Commercial Code==
In the US, Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] covers commercial contracts, and section 2-103 gives definitions of terms under this code.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/ Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Section 2-106 describes the difference between a '''present sale''' (recorded as a sales order) and a '''sale''' (recorded as a transfer of title to the buyer).

&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) In this Article unless the context otherwise requires "[[contract]]" and "agreement" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods.  "Contract for sale" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time.  A "sale" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section 2-401).  A "present sale" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Peter Monteverdi''' (7 June 1934 – 4 July 1998) was a Swiss carmaker and creator of the car brand ''[[Monteverdi (car)|Monteverdi]]''.

At the beginning of his career, Monteverdi was a [[automobile salesperson|car salesman]]. His father ran a garage and truck business, which Peter used as his initial inspiration. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldracingcars.com/driver/Peter_Monteverdi|title=Peter Monteverdi|first=Allen|last=Brown|website=oldracingcars.com|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1957 he acquired the Swiss franchise for [[Ferrari]], subsequently becoming Swiss importer for other international prestige brands including [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Bentley]].&lt;ref name="AutoMotoruSport2010"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Nachtschicht im Schloss: A report on a concours d'elegance at Schloss Bensberg | authorlink = Bernd Ostmann|journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u. Sport]]| volume = Heft 25 2010| pages = Seite 46 |date = 18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, he started producing cars under his own name.

==Formula One involvement ==
Peter Monteverdi was born in [[Binningen, Switzerland|Binningen]], in the northern Swiss canton of [[Basel-Landschaft]]. He engaged in the construction of [[Formula One]] cars from the late 1950s to the early 1960s. In 1961, he built the first Swiss Formula One car, which bore the name [[MBM (automobile)|MBM]] (''Monteverdi Basel Motoren''). He made a single Formula One appearance at the [[1961 Solitude Grand Prix]], where he retired after two laps, and subsequently withdrew his entry for the [[1961 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]]&lt;ref&gt;John Thompson, "The Formula One Record Book", Leslie Frewin Publishing, 1974. pp. 40-41&lt;/ref&gt; having been injured in a prior race. He subsequently retired from race driving.

In 1989 Monteverdi bought the [[Onyx (racing team)|Onyx]] Formula One team after its original backer ran into financial difficulties. The team's best result was when [[Stefan Johansson]] finished in third place at the [[1989 Portuguese Grand Prix]]. However, the involvement proved unsustainable and was terminated during the following season. A legacy was the [[Monteverdi Hai 650 F1]] sportscar, of which supposedly six copies were sold until 1994.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Death==
Monteverdi died from cancer on 4 July 1998 in Binningen, in his apartment directly above his own car-assembly workshop.&lt;ref name=AutoMotorundSport199815&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink = Bernd Ostmann  (Ed)| title =Traumautos aus der Schweiz: Monteverdi gestorben| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport]]| volume = 1998 Heft 15| pages = Seite 11|date = 15 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 64.

'''Product management''' is an organisational lifecycle function within a company dealing with the planning, forecasting, and production, or marketing of a product or products at all stages of the [[Product lifecycle (marketing)|product lifecycle]]. Similarly, product lifecycle management (PLM)&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=Product Life Cycle in Digital factory|last1=Kurkin|first1=O.|last2=Januška|first2=M.|publisher=International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA)|year=2010|isbn=9780982148945|location=Cairo|pages=1881-1886|script-title=|trans-title=In Knowledge management and innovation: A business competitive edge perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; integrates people, data, processes and business systems. It provides product information for companies and their extended supply chain enterprise.

The role may consist of [[New product development|product development]] and [[product marketing]], which are different (yet complementary) efforts, with the objective of maximizing sales revenues, market share, and profit margins. Product management also involves elimination decisions. Product elimination begins with the identification of elimination candidates, proceeds with the consideration of remedial actions, continues with a projection of the impact on the business as a whole if a candidate product is eventually eliminated, and concludes with the implementation stage, where management determines the elimination strategy for an item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Argouslidis|first1=P.|last2=Baltas|first2=G.|title=Structure in product line management: The role of formalization in service elimination decisions|journal=Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science|date=2007|volume=35|pages=475–491|doi=10.1007/s11747-006-0004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[product manager]] is often responsible for analyzing market conditions and defining features or functions of a product and for overseeing the production of the product. The role of product management spans many activities from strategic to tactical and varies based on the organizational structure of the company. To maximize the impact and benefits to an organization, Product management must be an independent function separate on its own.

While involved with the entire [[Product lifecycle (marketing)|product lifecycle]], the product management's main focus is on driving [[new product development]].  According to the [[Product Development and Management Association|Product Development and Management Association (PDMA)]], superior and differentiated new products&amp;mdash;ones that deliver unique benefits and superior value to the customer&amp;mdash;are the number one driver of success and product profitability.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Kenneth B. (Editor). The PDMA Handbook of New Product Development. Second Edition. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005. {{ISBN|0-471-48524-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the company size and history, product management has a variety of functions and roles. Sometimes there is a product manager, and sometimes the role of product manager is shared by other roles.  Frequently there is Profit and Loss (P&amp;L) responsibility as a key metric for evaluating product manager performance. In some companies, the product management function is the hub of many other activities around the product. In others, it is one of many things that need to happen to bring a product to market and actively monitor and manage it in-market.  In very large companies, the product manager may have effective control over shipment decisions to customers, when system specifications are not being met.

Product management often serves an inter-disciplinary role, bridging gaps within the company between teams of different expertise, most notably between engineering-oriented teams and commercially oriented teams.  For example, product managers often translate business objectives set for a product by Marketing or Sales into engineering requirements (sometimes called a Technical Specification). Conversely, they may work to explain the capabilities and limitations of the finished product back to Marketing and Sales (sometimes called a Commercial Specification). Product managers may also have one or more direct reports who manage operational tasks and/or a [[Change management|change manager]] who can oversee new initiatives.  Manufacturing is separate from the research function, the product manager has the responsibility to bridge the gaps if any exist.

In most technology companies, most product managers possess knowledge in the following areas: [[computer science]], business, and [[user experience]].

==Inbound and outbound==

Many{{what|date=September 2018}} refer to inbound (product development) and outbound (product marketing) functions.&lt;ref&gt;By Robert, Michael on Product Management and Marketing.

Inbound product management (aka inbound marketing) is the "radar" of the organization and involves absorbing information like customer research, competitive intelligence, industry analysis, trends, economic signals and competitive activity&lt;ref name="name"&gt;By Steven Haines. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=xTMWzXuPqgwC&amp;pg=PA389&amp;lpg=PA389&amp;dq=inbound+marketing+product+management+requirements&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GpxjBIyLsV&amp;sig=NgO7hkl0lnRZ092marDRr8H8m68&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wPtPT_nyG8iK0QG-o8HsDQ&amp;ved=0CHwQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=inbound&amp;f=false The Product Manager's Desk Reference]." Published by McGraw Hill. Page 390.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as documenting requirements and setting [[product strategy]].&lt;ref name="two"&gt;By Scott Sehlhorst, Tyner Blain.

Retrieved March 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, outbound activities are focused on distributing or pushing messages, training sales people, go to market strategies and communicating messages through channels like advertising, PR and events.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

In many organizations the inbound and outbound functions are performed by the same person.&lt;ref&gt;By Tarquin Clark, Toolbox. "[http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/tarquin/which-is-more-important-inbound-or-outbound-product-management-48362 Which is more important, inbound or outbound product management?]" September 12, 2011. Retrieved March 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

As these terms are under discussion, another way of looking at these activities is upstream and downstream product management, where 'upstream' is referring to any activity that helps to define, create, or improve the product, while 'downstream' refers to any activity that promotes the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Product Manager's Handbook|last=Gorchels|first=Linda|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2012|isbn=978-0-07-177298-3|location=United States|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This avoids the confusion with the term "inbound marketing" which nowadays clearly refers to a way of doing downstream product management, referring to 'making the product accessible', i.e. it can be found by suspects and prospects (compared to 'outbound marketing', where the product is 'pushed' in front of the suspect or prospect). 
The confusion stems mainly from the mix up between the term "Marketing" as a discipline, comprising Product Management, MarCom (Marketing Communications), etc. and using the same term 'Marketing' as a synonym for 'Promotion' or 'advertising', i.e. taking a product to the market (i.e. 'downstream').

It comes as a surprise that this confusion and ambiguity is hard to understand- because if you name the main (value creating) departments in today's organizations, you can clearly assign to Sales, R&amp;D, Operations, and Marketing their respective core functions and areas of responsibility. The core function of Marketing, that differentiates it from Sales, Operations, and R&amp;D is the ownership of the [[marketing mix]] (= 4 P: Product, Place, Price, Promotion). Still, many organizations put under 'Marketing' only Market Communications (MarCom), which is just the operational end of marketing and only a subset of what 'Promotion' comprises. From a Product Management perspective, MarCom is a supporting function (like IT, HR, Controlling etc.). In organizations, where the Product Management is weak or not existent, its tasks are taken over by the other departments (i.e. sales defines the distribution ('Place'), operations defines the prices, R&amp;D defines the product, MarCom decides on the promotion.

'''''Thinking Strategically: The Competitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Life''''' is a non-fiction book by Indian-American economist [[Avinash Dixit]] and [[Barry Nalebuff]], a professor of economics and management at [[Yale School of Management]]. The text was initially published by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] on February 1, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393029239|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|title=Thinking Strategically: The Competitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Life|accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book discusses issues of strategic behaviour, decision making, and [[game theory]]. The authors present the main concepts, such as [[backward induction]], [[auction theory]], [[Nash equilibrium]], noncooperative bargaining, to a general audience. Each concept is illustrated by examples from common life, business, sports, politics, etc.—as applying game theory to real life may be the best way of crystallizing the best options available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2138835?uid=3738936&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21106298406241|publisher=[[jstor.org]]|title=Thinking Strategically: The Competitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Life|accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{quote|Today our writers and critics nominate the books they have enjoyed reading most over the last twelve months. No rules were imposed but, as you will see, all have been encouraged to be adventurous and broaden their interests away from their usual subjects

''Thinking Strategically'' by Avinash Dixit &amp; Barry Nalebuff (W W Norton) offers essential training in making choices and weighing possibilities not only in business but in daily life. Reading it is a trip to the gym for the reasoning faculties. It presents game theory and business strategy as understandable, usable and everyday tools for living with others. Its examples of tactics in action range from King Lear to Maradonna. And the case studies make great bit-reading in queues or waiting-rooms. I also much enjoyed Howard Rheingold's ''Virtual Reality'' (Secker &amp; Warburg), which describes the computer-created world waiting around the corner of the century, and Simon Schama's ''Dead Certainties'' (Granta), which sent a bright spark between history and fiction: illuminating.}}

The '''Tomlinson Report''' was published on 25 November 2013 authored by [[Lawrence Tomlinson]] who was the Entrepreneur in Residence at the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomlinsonreport.com/ |title=Lawrence Tomlinson Report |publisher=Tomlinsonreport.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lawrence’s report focused on the large body of evidence he received from businesses about [[Royal Bank of Scotland|Royal Bank of Scotland's]] turnaround division, Global Restructuring Group (GRG).

==Background==
During his time as Entrepreneur in Residence, Lawrence uncovered very concerning patterns of behaviour which appeared to lead to the destruction of good and viable UK businesses.    Lawrence called for further investigation into this behaviour by the appropriate authorities and immediate action to stop this unscrupulous treatment of businesses.

The publication of the Tomlinson Report coincided with a Sunday Times investigation into the same issue, publishing their stories on the same date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/insight/article1344611.ece |title=You don’t expect a proper bank to pinch your house |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=2013-11-24 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory response==
The Financial Conduct Authority announced that they would undertake a section 166 investigation on 29 November 2013  and has since appointed Promontory Financial Services and Mazars to undertake the Skilled Person review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/statement-regarding-royal-bank-of-scotland |title=Statement regarding Royal Bank of Scotland - Financial Conduct Authority |publisher=Fca.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fca.org.uk/news/update-on-independent-review-of-rbs-treatment-of-business-customers-in-financial-difficulty |title=Update on independent review of Royal Bank of Scotland’s treatment of business customers in financial difficulty - Financial Conduct Authority |publisher=Fca.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence continues to work with the FCA Skilled Person to aid their review which is due to report in Quarter 3 of 2014.

==RBS response==
Immediately following the publication of the Tomlinson Report, RBS appointed Clifford Chance to investigate whether they were guilty of systematically defrauding their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs.com/news/2014/04/clifford-chance-report-into-allegations-of-systematic-fraud.html |title=RBS responds to Clifford Chance report into allegation of systematic fraud |publisher=Rbs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not something Lawrence accused the bank of.  The Clifford Chance Report was published on 17 April 2014.   Whilst it concentrated on accusations of fraud, many were surprised by how damning the report was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/04/17/rbs-clifford-chance-tomlinson-report_n_5167333.html |title=7 Things RBS Hoped You Would Not Notice In Its Clifford Chance Report |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |date=2014-04-17 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Total benefits of ownership (TBO)''' is a calculation that tries to summarise the positive effects of the acquisition of a [[Business plan|plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.auditmypc.com/tbo.asp|title = TBO Definitions|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-01|website = |publisher = Audit My PC|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an estimate of all the values that will affect a business. It is a financial estimate intended to help buyers and owners determine the direct and indirect benefits of a product or system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.asiaonline.net/EN/LanguageStudio/BenefitsROIAndTCO.aspx|title = Understanding Return On Investment (ROI) and Total Cost and Benefit of Ownership (TCBO)|date = |accessdate = 2015-10-28|website = Understanding Return On Investment (ROI) and Total Cost and Benefit of Ownership (TCBO)|publisher = Asia Online|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to determine potential [[Return On Investment|Return on Investment]] (ROI). The usage of TBO may lead to increase in efficiency and productivity of a business, improvements in decision-making or improvements in the workforce. It helps to identify important areas which a business should be focusing on, as well as uncovering the hidden aspects of the decisions made by the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/total-benefit-of-ownership-TBO|title = total benefit of ownership (TBO) definition|date = |accessdate = 2015-10-30|website = |publisher = TechTarget|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of concept ==
TBO goes beyond the initial purpose or implementation benefit to consider the full benefit of a decision or an asset over its [[Product lifetime|useful life]]. A TBO analysis often shows there can be a large difference between the short term benefit to the business and its long term benefit. This can include [[Operating cost|operational cost]] savings, productivity improvements, enhancements to a business’s ability to compete, greater [[employee retention]], increased [[brand equity]] and expanding sales reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.fuzebox.com/files/pdf/whitepapers/TCO.pdf|title = Analysing Your web conferencing: Total Cost of Ownership|date = |accessdate = 2015-10-30|website = |publisher = fuzebox|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a small company can now have access to the rest of the world's markets without the costs of travel. The decisions made from TBO analysis help adding monetary profit into the company's account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7FRGdB4EVg|title = How to show Total Benefits of Ownership [tm]|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-01|website = |publisher = Senior Advisory Group|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance of TBO ==
While many companies perform [[Total Cost of Ownership]] (TCO) analysis, TBO is considered to be as important as TCO. TCO aims to minimise the total cost of the business, whereas TBO targets the maximum value of the project. Enterprise decision makers often use both methods to estimate the actual value of an investment or strategic venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3450060/Hart_CostsBenefits.pdf?sequence=4|title = The Costs and Benefits of Ownership: A Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-02|website = |publisher = Harvard University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering a business proposition, the enterprise decision makers always consider other alternatives while deciding whether the original plan is the best. An advantage of using TBO is that it identifies the value of the short term and the long-term benefits of the propositions. This system helps the company to prioritise the importance of each decision. This analysis not only serves as a tool to reduce cost but also as a way to plan the future of the business, in a more detailed and sophisticated way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11740-011-0313-2|title = Linking total costs and benefits of ownership (TCBO) and process chain simulation for integrated assessment of manufacturing technologies and processes|date = |accessdate = 2015-10-28|doi=10.1007/s11740-011-0313-2|volume=5|pages=557–564 | last1 = Denkena | first1 = B. |journal=Production Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a company is considering whether to invest in a long-term project, such as [[infrastructure]]. TBO will consider whether the long-term benefit may outweigh the short-term benefits of [[opportunity cost]]; whether the money spent on investment may have a better alternate purpose, e.g. using the budget to improve training schemes for workers.

== Examples of different industries using Total Benefits of Ownership ==

=== Retailing industry with the use of Internet ===
The TBO concept is widely used within the web industry. For example, TBO identifies the benefits of using the Internet in a business. These include the exclusion of fixed cost (i.e. rent), as well as the decreasing cost of online advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wilsonmar.com/1tco.htm|title = Total Cost and Benefit of Ownership (TCBO)|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-04|website = |publisher = WilsonMar|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the key elements incorporated in the benefit of ownership within retailing industry. 
* Cheaper transportation cost
* Increase in global demand for products
* Decrease in variable cost ( i.e. cheaper wages)
* Benefits of outsourcing

=== Computer and software industries etc&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nashnetworks.ca/total-cost-of-ownership-tco-of-it.htm|title = Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of IT|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-02|website = Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of IT|publisher = Nash Networks Inc|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
* Software becomes more user-friendly
* Quicker data analysis
* Greater data storage space

He was born in [[Pittsburgh]] June 26, 1910, the son of [[financier]] [[William Larimer Mellon Sr.]] and a grandnephew of [[U.S. Treasury Secretary]] [[Andrew W. Mellon]].  His [[Mellon family|family]] fortune derived from [[Gulf Oil]], [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], [[BNY Mellon]], [[Koppers]], [[Alcoa]] and others.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}

He was married twice,&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D71F3BF936A3575BC0A96F948260 "W. L.

He owned and operated a [[cattle ranch]] in [[Arizona]] until, at the age of 37, he read about, and then studied, [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s [[Medical missions|medical missionary]] work in [[Gabon]], and resolved with Schweitzer's encouragement and guidance to create a similar [[third-world]] hospital.  He and Gwen Grant Mellon enrolled at [[Tulane University]]; he received his medical degree in 1954 at the age of 44, and she became qualified as a medical-laboratory technician.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;
