'''Alexander Zaïd''' (1886 − 10 July 1938) was one of the founders of the Jewish defense organizations [[Bar-Giora (organization)|Bar Giora]] and [[Hashomer]], and a prominent figure of the [[Second Aliyah]].

==Biography==
Zaïd was born in 1886 in [[Zima (town)|Zima]], a town in [[Irkutsk Oblast]], [[Siberia]].  His father had been deported from [[Vilna]] to [[Siberia]] due to revolutionary activity and his mother was a [[Subbotniks|Subbotnik]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3992298,00.html Russia's Subbotnik Jews get rabbi] Ynet, Published:  12.09.10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, the family moved to [[Irkutsk]]. In 1901 they returned to Vilna, where his father remarried. Two years later, the father died, too. The orphaned teenager met Michael Helpern, a [[First Aliyah]] pioneer sent to Vilna to promote immigration to [[History of Palestine#Ottoman era|Palestine]].  Zaid moved to Palestine in 1904, under the auspices of the [[Zionist Labour Movement]]. He worked at the [[winery]] in [[Rishon Letzion]], where he met [[Israel Shochat]], as a [[construction worker]] in [[Ben Shemen]] and a [[stonemason]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://zionism-israel.com/israel_news/2006/12/alexander-and-yiftah-zaid-end-of-legend.html The end of a legend]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, he helped establish the first Jewish watchmen's organization, the clandestine "[[Bar-Giora (organization)|Bar-Giora]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3456366,00.html Metal thieves vandalize Alexander Zeid's monument]&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 1909, he was one of the founders of [[Hashomer]], a Jewish defense organization, to safeguard the Jewish agricultural settlements in Palestine.

Zaid and his wife Tzippora were founders of Kibbutz [[Kfar Giladi]] in the [[Galilee]], which became a center of [[Hashomer]]'s underground activity. In 1926, following the establishment of the [[Haganah]], [[David Ben-Gurion]] demanded that Hashomer become subordinate to the new organization and transfer its weapons to it. Zaid and his wife supported this move, but most members of Kfar Giladi were opposed to it. As a result, the Zaids were forced to leave the kibbutz with their four young children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zionism-israel.com/israel_news/2006/12/alexander-and-yiftah-zaid-end-of-legend.html The end of a legend]&lt;/ref&gt; Zaid moved to [[Sheikh Abreik]] in the [[Valley of Jezreel]], where he worked as a watchman, overseeing the lands of the [[Jewish National Fund|JNF]]. The residents of the Arab village at the site had been evicted a few years earlier when the [[Sursuk family]] of [[Beirut]] sold the land.&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh L. Avneri, ''The claim of dispossession: Jewish land-settlement and the Arabs'', p122. The census of 1922 showed 111 Muslims living there (Census report, Table XI).&lt;/ref&gt; The locality was known to have archaeological importance but had never been excavated. In 1936, Zaid reported that he had found a breach in the wall of one of the known caves which led to another cave decorated with inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Mazar, ''Beth She'arim : Report on the Excavations during 1936-1940'', Vol. I, p27.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the excavation of the site and its identification as [[Beit She'arim]].

Zaïd survived two attacks by [[Arabs]], but on the night of 10 July 1938, he was killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/people/BIOS/zaid.html Alexander Zaid (1886-1938)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001230044/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/people/bios/zaid.html |date=2006-10-01 }} Jewish Agency&lt;/ref&gt; He was ambushed by an Arab gang while on his way to meet members of kibbutz [[Alonim]]. The killer was Qassem Tabash, a [[Bedouin]] from the al-Hilaf tribe. In 1942, the [[Palmach]] killed Tabash in retaliation. Zaïd was survived by his wife and four children.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/1.4944736&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
On a hilltop overlooking the Jezreel Valley is a bronze statue of Alexander Zaïd on horseback sculpted by David Polus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.israelphilately.org.il/articles/content/en/000531 Work of David Polus]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Givat Zaid]] and [[Beit Zaid]] were named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/939869.html Jezreel Valley gets it guard back]&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Alexander Penn]] dedicated his poem, ''Adamah, Admati'' ("Land, My Land") to Alexander Zaïd.

'''André Hueston Mack''' (born December 25, 1972) is an American [[sommelier]], [[winemaker]], and author. He is the first [[African American]] to win the title of Best Young Sommelier in America (2003), and was the runner-up for the title of Best Sommelier in North America in 2004.

==Career==
Despite a successful career with [[Citigroup|Citicorp Investment Services]], in the early 2000s Andre Mack decided to leave his "[[desk job]]" to pursue his passion for [[wine]]. Mack began to study wine in earnest while working at [[The Palm (restaurant)|The Palm]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. During his time working as a sommelier there, Mack discovered the joys of introducing guests to the little-known vineyards that first attracted him to the business and "the instant gratification of a guest's reaction." He left The Palm to work as head sommelier with the team that opened Bohanan's Prime Steaks and Seafood in San Antonio. In 2003, at the age of 30, he competed and won the title of Best Young Sommelier in America, awarded by the [[Confrerie de la Chaine des Rotisseurs|Chaine des Rotisseurs]]. He was the first African American sommelier to do so. Gaining exposure, [[Thomas Keller]] offered Mack a position on the opening team of his New York restaurant, [[Per Se (restaurant)|Per Se]]. He accepted the offer and spent three years as head sommelier one of New York's few four-star restaurants, where he worked to manage a 2500-selection award-winning wine list and consulted regularly with Chef Keller on menu and pairing development. His wine lists have also received recognition by ''[[Wine Spectator]]'', and he has been featured in ''[[Food &amp; Wine Magazine|Food &amp; Wine]]'', ''[[Wine &amp; Spirits]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Huffington Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/09/holiday-drink-picks-from-sommelier-andre-mack_n_1139068.html | publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] | title=Holiday Drinks From Sommelier Andre Mac | first=Jessica Cumberbatch| last=Anderson |accessdate=22 February 2013 |date=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324001104578163310319076972 | publisher=[[WSJ]] | title=A Wine Man in a Hurry | first=Lettie| last=Teague |accessdate=22 February 2013 |date=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Black Enterprise]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.blackenterprise.com/mag/in-high-spirits/ | publisher=[[Black Enterprise]] | title=In High Spirits | first=Joseph| last=Dumas |accessdate=22 February 2013 |date=1 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was honored in 2007 with ''The Network Journal'''s 40-Under-Forty Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=40 Under Forty Class of 2007|url=http://www.tnj.com/40-under-forty/2007/andre-hueston-mack|work=The Network Journal|publisher=The Network Journal|accessdate=23 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406085742/http://www.tnj.com/40-under-forty/2007/andre-hueston-mack|archive-date=2013-04-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mack is an ardent wine educator who has been invited to host seminars and lead panel discussions at several  food and wine gatherings including The Food &amp; Wine Classic in [[Aspen, Colorado]] and the [[Newport Mansions]] Wine and Food Festival. He also curates wines for [[Club W]], a wine club for a new generation of drinkers, to continue his mission of making wine more accessible.
==Personal life==
Since 2008, Mack has been married to author Phoebe Damrosch, whose ''New York Times'' notable book, ''Service Included: Four-Star Secrets of an Eavesdropping Waiter'', detailed their courtship and collaboration during the early years of Per Se. As of early 2013, Mack is in the process of writing his own book, a culinary activity and coloring book that
pulls together some of the most innovative chefs, ingredients, and technique.

==Television appearances ==
Mack appeared as a guest judge along with two [[Michelin stars]] chef [[David Kinch]] on episode 4 (entitled "Daring Pairings") of [[The Taste#Season 1|Season 1]] of the ABC reality show ''[[The Taste]]'', which aired on February 12, 2013.

==Business pursuits==
In 2007 Mack founded Maison Noir Wines (formerly named Mouton Noir Wines until a dispute with [[Chateau Mouton Rothschild]]) after having forged  relationships with  [[Oregon wine|growers and winemakers from Oregon]] over many years.

Based on the success of the [[wine label]]s he created for Maison Noir Wines, in 2011 Mack established Get Fraiche Cru, a boutique [[graphic design]] firm, for which he serves as creative director.  He has worked with clients such as Joel Gott, Palm Bay Imports, and Charles &amp; Charles.

'''Aslan (Khalid) Aliyevich Maskhadov''' ({{lang-ce|Аслан Али кӏант Масхадан|Aslan Ali-khant Masxadan}}; {{lang-ru|Аслан Алиевич Масхадов}}; 21 September 1951 – 8 March 2005) was a leader of the Chechen terrorism movement and the third President of the unrecognized [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]].

He was credited by many with the [[Chechen people|Chechen]] victory in the [[First Chechen War]], which allowed for the establishment of the de facto independent Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Maskhadov was elected [[President of Ichkeria|President]] of [[Chechnya]] in January 1997. Following the start of the [[Second Chechen War]] in August 1999, he returned to leading the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[Resistance movement|resistance]] against the Russian army. He was killed in Tolstoy-Yurt, a village in northern Chechnya, in March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenta.ru/articles/2005/12/02/bunker/ Кавказ: Масхадов и Басаев прятались в одном бункере] // [[Lenta.ru]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Сын Масхадова"&gt;[http://www.kavkaz-uzel.ru/newstext/news/id/926840.html Сын Масхадова опровергает официальную версию гибели лидера сепаратистов Чечни] // Кавказ Мемо.Ру&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
On 21 September 1951, Aslan Aliyevich Maskhadov was born in [[Karaganda Region]] of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]] (SSR) of the [[Soviet Union]], in the small village of Shakai, during the [[Operation Lentil (Caucasus)|mass deportation of the Chechen people]] ordered in 1944 by [[Joseph Stalin]]. His family was of the Alaroy [[teip]]. In 1957, his family returned to [[Chechnya]] where they settled in [[Zebir-Yurt]], [[Nadterechny District]].

Maskhadov joined the [[Soviet Army]], trained in the neighbouring [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]] and graduated from the [[Tbilisi]] Artillery School in 1972. He then graduated with honours from the [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] Kalinin Higher Artillery in 1981.&lt;ref name="memo"&gt;[http://eng.kavkaz.memo.ru/persontext/engperson/id/560900.html Maskhadov, Aslan (Khalid) Alievich] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211095815/http://eng.kavkaz.memo.ru/persontext/engperson/id/560900.html |date=11 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was posted to [[Hungary]] with a [[self-propelled artillery]] regiment until 1986 and then from 1986 in the [[Baltic Military District]]. He served from 1990 as the [[chief of staff]] of Soviet missile and artillery forces in [[Vilnius]], capital of the [[Lithuanian SSR]]. In January 1991, Maskhadov participated in the [[January Events]], the seizure of the television tower by Soviet troops (which he regretted later{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}), but didn't participate in the assault itself.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lenta.ru]], [http://www.lenta.ru/lib/14160290/full.htm Масхадов, Аслан (Profile in Russian for Aslan Maskhadov)]&lt;/ref&gt; During his service in the Soviet Army, he was presented with two [[Order for Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces of the USSR|Orders For Service to Homeland]]. Maskhadov retired from the Soviet Army in 1992 with the rank of a [[colonel]] and returned to his native land. He was at the head of ChRI [[civil defence]] from late 1992 to November 1993.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], in the summer of 1993, Maskhadov took part in raids on the armed opposition against the government of [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] in the [[Urus-Martan]], Nadterechny, and [[Gudermes]] districts. An unsuccessful anti-Dudayev [[mutiny]] in November 1993 resulted in the dismissal of Viskhan Shakhabov as chief of staff of the Chechen armed forces, Maskhadov was appointed as the acting chief of staff and, in March 1994, as the chief of staff.

===First Chechen War===
{{main|First Chechen War}}
In December 1994, when the [[First Chechen War]] broke out, he was the senior military figure on the Chechen side during the war and was widely seen as being instrumental to the Chechen victory over the Russian forces. As the First Deputy Chairman of the ChRI State Defence Council (ChRI President Dudayev was the chairman) and the chief of staff, Maskhadov organised defence of the Chechen capital during the [[Battle of Grozny (November 1994)|Battle of Grozny]]. Maskhadov commanded the city from the [[Presidential Palace, Grozny|Presidential Palace in Grozny]], where on one occasion a Russian [[bunker buster]] bomb landed 20 meters from him but failed to explode. In February 1995, Dudayev promoted Aslan to [[Divisional General]].

Beginning in June 1995, Maskhadov took part in peace talks in [[Grozny]] to resolve the crisis in Chechnya. In June 1996, at the negotiations in [[Nazran]], [[Ingushetia]], Maskhadov, on behalf of the ChRI administration, signed the Protocol of the Commission's Meeting on Ceasefire and Measures to Resolve the Armed Conflict in the CRI. In August 1996, after Grozny's seizure by Chechen units he repeatedly held talks with [[Alexander Lebed]] and on 31 August 1996, the signing of the [[Khasav-Yurt Accord]] took place, a [[ceasefire]] agreement, and peace treaty which marked the end of the First Chechen War. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria===

On 17 October 1996, Maskhadov was appointed [[Prime Minister]] of [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Ichkeria]], while he also remained Chief of Staff and [[Defence Minister]]. Maskhadov nominated himself for [[President of Ichkeria]] on 3 December 1996, for the January 1997 free democratic presidential and parliamentary elections held in Chechnya under the aegis of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], running primarily against [[Shamil Basayev]] and [[Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The elections were conducted on the basis of the Chechen constitution adopted in March 1992, according to which the Chechen Republic was an independent state. Representatives of more than 20 countries, as well as the [[United Nations]] and the OSCE, attended the elections as observers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Running with [[Vakha Arsanov]], who became his [[vice president]], Mashkadov won a majority of 60% of the votes and was congratulated by the [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]], who pledged to work towards rebuilding relations with Chechnya. Maskhadov was inaugurated on 12 February 1997, and at the same time he assumed the office of prime minister and abolished the office of Defence Minister he had occupied since late 1996. Maskhadov remained commander-in-chief of the republican armed forces. On 12 May 1997, Maskhadov then attained the apex of his political career when he signed a [[peace treaty]] with Yeltsin at the [[Kremlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/MHII-65G9TK?OpenDocument|title=Peace Treaty and Principles of Interrelation between Russian Federation and Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|date=12 May 1997|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1996, when Maskhadov assumed his office, nearly half a million people (40% of Chechya prewar population) had been internally displaced and lived in refugee camps or overcrowded villages.&lt;ref name="dissident"&gt;
[[Alexander Goldfarb (author)|Alex Goldfarb]] and Marina Litvinenko. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1416551654/ "Death of a Dissident: The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB." Free Press, New York, 2007.] {{ISBN|978-1-4165-5165-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The economy was destroyed and the [[warlord]]s had no intention to disband their militias. Under such circumstances, Maskhadov's political fortunes began to wane. His political standing within Chechnya became increasingly insecure as he lost control to Basayev and other warlords. Even his Vice-President Arsanov became his political enemy. Just like in the years before the First Chechen War under Dudayev, the years of Chechen independence were notorious for [[organized crime]], including kidnapping, leading to several public executions of criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR460251997?open&amp;of=ENG-373 |title=Chechen Republic: Amnesty International condemns public execution-Amnesty International |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041121235259/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR460251997?open&amp;of=ENG-373 |archivedate=21 November 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.lv/en/news/press-releases/1997/sep/2089/ "Latvia Condemns Public Executions in Chechnya"] (23 September 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Maskhadov attempted with only limited success to curb the growth of [[Wahhabism]] and other [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist Muslim]] groups supported by Basayev, producing a split in the Chechen separatist movement between Islamic fundamentalism and Chechen nationalists. In February 1999, as a concession to radical Islamists, Maskhadov introduced [[Sharia|Islamic Sharia law]]. The Sharia courts that were established sentenced people to death,  flogging, executing people for crimes such as adultery.&lt;ref name="ware"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chechnya: From Past to Future|editor=Richard Sakwa|publisher=Anthem Press|year=2005|pages=79–115|chapter=Robert Bruce Ware: Mythology and Political Failure in Chechnya|isbn=978-1-84331-164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maskhadov survived assassination attempts on his life three times, on 23 July 1998, 21 March and 10 April 1999, in which the attackers used [[anti-tank missile]]s and bombs. Russian secret services were officially blamed.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=21&amp;issue_id=1353&amp;article_id=13685 |title=Programs - The Jamestown Foundation |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214231526/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=21&amp;issue_id=1353&amp;article_id=13685 |archivedate=14 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Chechen War===
{{main|Second Chechen War}}
In the summer of 1999, Maskhadov condemned an attempt by Basayev and [[Ibn Al-Khattab]] to spread war to the neighboring republic of [[Dagestan]]&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt; (known as the [[Invasion of Dagestan]]). This raid, and the [[Russian Apartment Bombings]], were both blamed on the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. On 1 October 1999, the then Russian Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] declared the authority of President Maskhadov and his parliament illegitimate. Putin sent Russian forces into Chechnya, and his promise of a quick and decisive victory propelled him to the Russian Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profile.ru/items/?item=8475 Профиль — еженедельный деловой журнал]{{dead link|date=June 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October 1999, Maskhadov outlined a peace plan offering a crackdown on renegade warlords,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19991011/ai_n14278495 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115001724/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19991011/ai_n14278495 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 January 2008 |title=FindArticles.com - CBSi |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the offer was rejected by the Russian side. In response, President Maskhadov declared a ''[[Ghazw|gazavat]]'' (holy war) to confront the approaching Russian army. Soon, [[martial law]] was declared in Ichkeria and reservists were called, and the building of his Presidential Palace was one of the supposed targets of the disastrous [[Grozny ballistic missile attack]] on 23 October 1999.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Maskhadov was one of the main commanders in the [[Battle of Grozny (1999–2000)]] along with [[Shamil Basayev]], [[Ruslan Gelayev]], [[Ibn Al-Khattab]], Aslambek Ismailov and Khunkarpasha Israpilov. Maskhadov along with his men launched daring counter-attacks against the Russian troops while fighting in [[Grozny]] and also effectively used the sewer systems to attack Russian troops from behind. After a meeting with top rebel commanders, Maskhadov and others agreed to withdraw from Grozny and continue to attack Russian forces in the cities and towns surrounding the city. Maskhadov was  the first to withdraw because of his importance to the rebel cause and because he was the official President of Chechnya. As Maskhadov and his men retreated, they set up a vast amount of booby traps and landmines to hinder Russian forces and make most of Grozny impassable.:&lt;ref name="cul"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050211024352/http://chechnya.unesco.ru/books/culofchechnyarus.pdf Культура Чечни: история и современные проблемы / Отв. ред. Х. В. Туркаев; Ин-т этнологии и антропологии. — М.: Наука, 2002. — 382 с. —] {{ISBN|5-02-008832-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Chechen forces' withdrawal from Grozny following another battle for the city, Maskhadov returned to a life of a guerrilla leader, living in hiding as Russia's second most wanted man after Basayev, with Russia placing a $10 million [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on his capture. He was seen as the official political leader of the separatist forces during the war, but it is unclear what kind of a military role he played. Maskhadov offered his readiness for unconditional peace talks with Moscow several times in 2000 alone, continuing in the following years, but his appeals for a political solution were always ignored by the Russian side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1057400.html|title=Analysis: Is It Too Late For Peace Talks In Chechnya?|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maskhadov advocated armed resistance to what he saw as a Russian occupation of Chechnya but condemned attacks on civilians. He allegedly supported the assassination of pro-Russian Chechen President [[Akhmad Kadyrov]] in Chechnya, whilst condemning the Russian assassination of Chechen separatist ex-President [[Yandarbiyev]] in [[Qatar]] in 2004. Maskhadov often denied responsibility for the increasingly brutal terrorist acts against Russian civilians by Basayev's followers, continually issuing denunciations of such incidents through spokesmen abroad, such as [[Akhmed Zakayev]] in [[London]]. However, on 24 October 2002, radio communications were intercepted from Maskhadov's messages wherein he called for intensification of terrorist activities and sabotage in Russian territory.&lt;ref name="ware"/&gt; Evidence for Maskhadov's complicity in the 2002 [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] was provided by its two principal perpetrators, Movsar Barayev and Abu Said.&lt;ref name="ware"/&gt; Although he initially denied responsibility for the [[2004 Nazran raid]], in which 98 police officers/troops were killed, in July 2004 Maskhadov publicly accepted responsibility for the attacks. In the same month, Maskahdov promised similar attacks would happen, and vowed that the winner of Chechnya's upcoming presidential election would be illegitimate and would be attacked if necessary.&lt;ref name="ware"/&gt; He described the rebels behind the [[Beslan school siege]] as "madmen" driven out of their senses by Russian acts of brutality and called the terrorist attack an atrocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/459302.stm|title=Obituary: Aslan Maskhadov|date=8 March 2005|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2016|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2005, Maskhadov issued a special order to stop all military operations except those in self-defense, both inside and outside Chechnya, until the end of February (the date marking the anniversary of the Stalin's [[Vainakh]] deportations of 1944) as a gesture of good will, and again called for a negotiated end to the Chechen conflict. Umar Khambiev, his designated negotiator, said that the separatists were no longer seeking independence, but only "guarantees for the existence of the Chechen nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1057320.html|title=Chechnya: Cease-Fire Holding, But Little Chance Of Negotiations Seen|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This surprise, unilateral [[ceasefire]] was supported by Basayev but flatly rejected by the Russian and pro-Russian leaders who, once again, refused to negotiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/MHII-69G9KJ?OpenDocument|title=Chechnya: Ceasefire or bluff?|date=9 February 2005|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maskhadov's order to temporarily cease all offensive actions was largely followed by the rebel movement, except in Dagestan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=407&amp;issue_id=3225&amp;article_id=2369226 |title=Programs - The Jamestown Foundation |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214231531/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=407&amp;issue_id=3225&amp;article_id=2369226 |archivedate=14 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
On 8 March 2005, less than a month after Maskhadov announced the cease-fire, the head of the [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation]] (FSB) [[Nikolay Patrushev]] announced that special forces attached to the FSB had ''"today carried out an operation in the settlement of Tolstoy-Yurt, as a result of which the international  jihadist and leader of armed groups Maskhadov was killed, and his closest comrades-in-arms detained"''. He said the special operations unit had wanted to take Maskhadov alive for interrogation, but claim that they killed him accidentally with a [[grenade]] thrown into a bunker where Maskhadov was hiding.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Akhmed Zakayev, one of his closest allies who acted as his spokesman and foreign minister, told a Russian radio station that it was probable that Maskhadov had indeed been killed; he indicated later that a new Chechen leader could be chosen within days. [[Vladimir Putin]] awarded those responsible for the killings with medals. Shortly after Maskhadov's death, the Chechen rebel council announced that [[Abdul-Halim Sadulayev]] had assumed the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121222132927/http://www.savelev.ru/book/?ch=18&amp;mode=reply Андрей Савельев: Чёрная книга чеченской войны]&lt;/ref&gt;

Four Chechens, Vakhit Murdashev, Viskhan Hadzhimuradov, Skanarbek Yusupov and Ilias Iriskhanov, were captured by the special operation. According to the ballistic evidence at their trial in the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic, Maskhadov was killed by a shot from the pistol of [[Viskhan Hadzhimuradov]], his nephew and bodyguard. Hadzhimuradov testified that he does not remember whether he shot Maskhadov or not since he was stunned by an explosion but after the capture Hadzhimuradov reportedly said: "My uncle always told me to shoot him if he is wounded and his capture is imminent. He said that if he is taken prisoner, he would be mistreated like [[Saddam Hussein]] had been".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agentura.ru/timeline/2005/maskhadov/?id=1130484780 «Следствие: Масхадова застрелил охранник.»]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unmarked grave==
On 24 April 2006, the General Procurator's Office of Russia officially refused to turn the remains of Aslan Maskhadov over to his relatives for burial. The refusal was described as legal: &lt;blockquote&gt; Maskhadov A. A., in connection with terrorism, was criminally responsible for many separate serious crimes on the territory of the Russian Federation. Taking this into account, it was decided to suppress Maskhadov's activities and Maskhadov was being pursued for our protection. The burial of such persons is carried out in accordance with the rules concerning the burial of those whose death was a result of the suppression of their terrorist actions, affirmed by the government of the Russian Federation on 20 March 2003, in Order No. 164. In this case, the body is not handed over for burial, and the location of the burial is not communicated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maskhadov's family has been campaigning for the release of his remains or a disclosure of what happened to his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://eng.kavkaz.memo.ru/newstext/engnews/id/1181168.html |title="Maskhadov's family asks religious leaders to help them to get his body out" |access-date=8 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214230523/http://eng.kavkaz.memo.ru/newstext/engnews/id/1181168.html |archive-date=14 February 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://eng.kavkaz.memo.ru/newstext/engnews/id/1188808.html |title="All-European action for giving out Maskhadov's body to his relatives for burial" |access-date=8 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616083250/http://eng.kavkaz.memo.ru/newstext/engnews/id/1188808.html |archive-date=16 June 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family life==
He married at the age of 17. His wife Kusama holds a graduate degree in teaching. They had two children: a son, Anzor, who took part in military action during the First Russian-Chechen War, and a daughter, Fatima.

'''Barbadians''', or '''Bajans''', are the people who are identified with the country of [[Barbados]], be it the citizens of the country or their descendants in the Barbadian diaspora. This connection may be residential, legal, historical, or cultural. For most Barbadians, several (or all) of these connections exist and are collectively the source of their identity. Barbadians are a [[multi-ethnic]] and [[multicultural]] society of various different ethnic, religious and national origins.

==Diaspora==
Many Barbarians now live overseas and outside of Barbados; the majority have migrated to [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] countries, including 37,780 [[Barbadian Canadians|Barbadians in Canada]], some 19,000 in the [[Barbadian British|United Kingdom]], around 65,000 in the [[United States]] and some 500–1,000 Barbadians in [[Liberia]]. In addition to Anglophone countries other groups of Barbadians have moved to Latin countries including: [[Brazil]], [[Cuba]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gisbarbados.gov.bb/index.php?categoryid=15&amp;p2_articleid=7740 Bajan Descendants Living In Cuba Show Off Their Art]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://migrationeducation.de/51.1.html?&amp;rid=118&amp;cHash=1eee12c0ae606f4e9240ee0a68336729 |title=Chamberlain, M.: Migration and Post-Colonialism: the Commonwealth Caribbean, 2008 |access-date=6 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913072544/http://migrationeducation.de/51.1.html?&amp;rid=118&amp;cHash=1eee12c0ae606f4e9240ee0a68336729 |archive-date=13 September 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bajanreporter.com/2009/05/long-lost-bajans-in-panama-looking-for-family-in-barbados-can-you-help/ ‘LONG LOST’ BAJANS IN PANAMA – LOOKING FOR FAMILY IN BARBADOS, CAN YOU HELP?]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barbara í Gongini''' (born June 12, 1966) is a Faroese-Danish avant-garde [[fashion designer]] from [[Fuglafjørður, Faroe Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tyskland.um.dk/de/kultur-und-kreativitaet/daenische-kultur-in-deutschland/our-arctic-future/die-modedesigner|title=Die Modedesigner|first=Dänemark in|last=Deutschland|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Barbara í Gongini is a Faroese [[avant-garde]] fashion designer who was born in [[Fuglafjørður]] and grew up in the old part of [[Tórshavn]], the capital city of the [[Faroe Islands]] &lt;ref name="A Laconic Journey With Barbara I Gongini"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thekinsky.com/conversations/a-laconic-journey-with-barbara-i-gongini/ | title=A Laconic Journey With Barbara I Gongini | publisher=The Kinsky | date=13 June 2014 | access-date=13 February 2018 | author=Saalmink, Marlo}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
As a child, she always had an inclination for the arts and design&lt;ref name="Barbara I Gongini: Nordic by Nature"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/fashion/barbara-i-gongini | title=Barbara I Gongini: Nordic by Nature | publisher= Interview Magazine | date=1 May 2014 | access-date=13 February 2018 | author=Lawson, Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which led her to study painting, art and textile construction, graduating in 1990.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

Gongini completed her design education at [[Danmarks Designskole|Denmark’s School of Design]], at the Institute of Unica Design, in 1996.&lt;ref name="The Rebel Heart of Designer Barbara I Gongini"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://eluxemagazine.com/fashion/designer-barbara-i-gongini-2/ | title=The Rebel Heart of Designer Barbara I Gongini | publisher= Eluxe Magazine | access-date=13 February 2018 | author=Di Boscio, Chere}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing up with the values of the Faroe Islands, a small community that places focus on using the most of raw natural resources, influenced Gongini’s approach to fashion, inspiring her to create designs that are rich in multi-functional elements, so that they can be reused and transformed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dashmagazine.net/?p=15547 |website=Dash Magazine |date=1 March 2016 |title=Untitled|access-date=13 February 2018 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;Growing up with those values, of making the most out of what is given and these limitation, shaped logic towards creating designs that are rich in multi-functional elements,&amp;nbsp;...'}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Fashion design career==

Gongini’s first clothing collection was made from fabric residue and launched in 2000, when she was still part of the Könrøg movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dashmagazine.net/?p=15547 |website=Dash Magazine |date=1 March 2016 |title=Untitled|access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Könrøg was an artist collective formed by 10 Danish artists between 2001-2006, in response to the [[Antwerp Six]] designer collective that existed in the ‘80s. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.b.dk/mode/anna-og-modebaestet |title=Anna og modebæstet |date=13 September 2008 |access-date=13 February 2018 |language=Danish |trans-title=Anna and Fashion Boasted |quote=...&amp;nbsp;Könrøg eksisterede fra 2001 til 2006 og havde butik i Hyskenstræde i det indre København.&amp;nbsp;...'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, she was also part of the team behind the Könrøg clothing store in [[Copenhagen]], which at the time was known as the capital’s most hip shop with Danish [[Fashion design|designer]] clothes and [[Alternative fashion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/12/travel/going-to-copenhagen.html |title=GOING TO Copenhagen |date=12 June 2005 |publisher=The New York Times |author=Sherwood, Seth|access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, for those who dared to stand out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fyens.dk/bolig/Bolig-uden-lige/artikel/1476144 |title=Bolig uden lige |date=2 December 2009 |access-date=13 February 2018 |language=Danish |trans-title=Housing without equal |quote=...&amp;nbsp;Könrøg, der var hovedstadens absolut hippeste butik med dansk designertøj, til dem der turde skille sig ud,&amp;nbsp;...'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gongini stopped working for Könrøg in 2004 in order to focus on her design career, while the store closed down two year later, in 2006.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 2005, Gongini established her namesake label, with the brand name stylised as BARBARA I GONGINI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nordicstylemag.com/2014/08/barbara-i-gongini-ss15-copenhagen-fashion-week/ |title=Gender Neutrality by BARBARA I GONGINI |publisher=Nordic Style Mag |author=Kristinsdóttir, Signý |date=10 August 2014 |access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days, the BARBARA I GONGINI collections were created for both men and women, focusing on androgyny and multifunctionality. The menswear line only became separate starting with the Autumn/Winter 2013 collection, which was presented at the [[Copenhagen Fashion Week]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nordicstylemag.com/2013/04/nordic-avant-garde-barbara-i-gongini-collection-18-aw13/ |title=Nordic Avant-Garde: BARBARA I GONGINI |publisher=Nordic Style Mag |author=Káradóttir, Marta |date=13 April 2013|access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BARBARA I GONGINI AW2016 RUNWAY MAN.jpg|thumb|left|BARBARA I GONGINI AW2016 Men's Collection]]
In her fashion designs, she makes extensive use of draping and layering techniques, often creating asymmetrical garments that can be worn in multiple ways. Juxtaposition and deconstruction play a central part, with Gongini predominantly using black and non-colors ‘to allow fabrics and textures to speak as color instead’.&lt;ref name="Barbara I Gongini: Nordic by Nature"/&gt;
She combines a variety of natural and recycled textiles, sometimes mixing several types of materials, such as wool, leather, cotton and plastic, in a single garment. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norrmagazin.de/kultur-lebensstil/avantgarde-aus-wolle/ |title=Woll Couture: Färöische Mode |trans-title=Wool couture: Faroese fashion |publisher=Norr Magazin |author=Ladinger, Andrea |access-date=13 February 2018 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gongini’s leather garments are often treated to give a dramatic texture that is reminiscent of the Faroese landscape.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metalmagazine.eu/en/post/interview/barbara-i-gongini-nordic-avant-garde-in-silence |title=Barbara I Gongini: Nordic Avant-Garde in Silence |publisher=Metal Magazine |author=Maanmies, My |access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her designs are available at the BARBARA I GONGINI headquarters showroom in Copenhagen and in specialized avant-garde clothing stores worldwide.
Gongini’s avant-garde design philosophy means that the collections are not trend-based, but focus on ‘nurturing a longevity formula’.&lt;ref name="Barbara I Gongini: Nordic by Nature"/&gt; She often compares her collections to new chapters to turn to in a story, describing them as ‘numerical’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.deuxhomm.es/2015/05/06/barbara-i-gongini-autumnwinter-2015/ | title=Barbara I Gongini Autumn/Winter 2015 | publisher= Deuxhommes | date=6 May 2015 | access-date=13 February 2018 | author=Cao, Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a proponent of the zero-waste wardrobe, she seeks to lengthen the life-cycle of garments through innovative designs called ‘multiways’.
&lt;ref name="The Rebel Heart of Designer Barbara I Gongini"/&gt;

[[File:BARBARA I GONGINI AW2016 RUNWAY WOMAN.jpg|thumb|BARBARA I GONGINI AW2016 Women's Collection]]
Although her fashion collections integrate [[sustainability]] principles and she has been said to be ‘ahead of her time when it comes to sustainability’&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;, Gongini is known for making  exceptions ‘if a few materials do not quite meet the standards’, in order not to compromise on design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeit.de/online/2009/36/oeko-mode-kopenhagen/seite-2 |title=Die Dogma-Schneiderinnen |trans-title=The Dogma Tailors |publisher=Zeit |date=31 August 2009 |author=Ströbele, Carolin |access-date=13 February 2018 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nominated for the Danish Fashion Award Committee’s Ethical Award in 2010, she was also selected to represent [[Denmark]] at the Nordic Eco Fashion and Product Design Exhibition in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecofashiontalk.com/2011/03/barbara-i-congini/ |title=Barbara I Gongini |publisher=Eco Fashion Talk |access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her runway collections were first shown at the [[Paris Fashion Week]] in 2017. At this time, she also presented the film MODULE MODULAR, a video collaboration with director and photographer Mikkel Völcker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hungertv.com/feature/discover-barbara-i-gongini-a-nordic-brand-you-need-to-know/ |website=Hunger TV |date=8 March 2017 |title=DISCOVER BARBARA I GONGINI: A NORDIC BRAND YOU NEED TO KNOW|access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Barbara í Gongini was awarded the [[Faroese Cultural Prize]], the highest distinction that a person of culture can receive in the Faroe Islands.



==Artistic collaborations==
During her career, Gongini has been an active participant in the Nordic art discourse&lt;ref name="The Rebel Heart of Designer Barbara I Gongini"/&gt;, joining interdisciplinary collaborations showcased around the world. Notable examples include “The Weather Diaries”, an exhibition which was part of the third Nordic Fashion Biennale, shown at the [[Museum Angewandte Kunst]] in [[Frankfurt]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://form.de/de/news/the-weather-diaries-3rd-nordic-fashion-biennale |title=The Weather Diaries. 3rd Nordic Fashion Biennale |publisher=Form |access-date=13 February 2018 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nordic Heritage Museum]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/visual-arts/nordic-heritage-museum-casts-edgy-weather-diaries-exhibit/ |title=Nordic Heritage Museum casts edgy ‘Weather Diaries’ exhibit |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=20 September 2016 |access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “Outer Dark”, a collaboration that saw her work exhibited next to household avant-garde fashion names such as [[Yohji Yamamoto]], [[Martin Margiela]] and [[Alexander McQueen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumangewandtekunst.de/en/museum/exhibitions/outer-dark.html |title=Outer Dark.

==In popular culture==
Barbara I Gongini’s designs have been spotted on celebrities such as [[Florence Welch]] of [[Florence and the Machine]], in her 2012 [[music video]] for [[Never Let Me Go (Florence and the Machine song)|Never Let Me Go]], as well as on [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Rihanna]] and [[Chelsea Wolfe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bullettmedia.com/article/chelsea-wolfe-gets-deep/ | title=Chelsea Wolfe Gets Deep | publisher= Bullett Magazine | access-date=13 February 2018 | author=Weiss, Alexandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clarence and Carl Aguirre''' (born April 21, 2002) are former [[conjoined twins]] born in [[Silay]], [[Philippines]]. They were conjoined at the top of the head (vertical craniopagus). In 2003 they were brought to the [[United States]] by their mother Arlene in the hope of having them surgically separated. A revolutionary new process was used in separating the twin boys. Because "marathon" surgical operations have historically led to a high rate of mortality and morbidity, Clarence and Carl's doctors chose to separate them in several smaller operations, allowing the twins to recuperate after each surgery.

In October 2003, tissue expanders (pouches filled with [[Saline (medicine)|saline]]) were implanted under the boys' scalps. This is common practice in separating conjoined twins, as it creates more skin that can be used to cover the twins' wounds after separation. Over the next ten months, the brothers underwent several more operations to tease apart their joined skulls and brains. On August 4, 2004, the final surgery was completed. All of these operations were performed at [[Montefiore Medical Center]] in [[the Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]] by a team led by Dr. James T. Goodrich, a pediatric neurosurgeon and Dr. David A. Staffenberg, a plastic surgeon. They received most of their post-operative rehabilitation at [[Blythedale Children's Hospital]] in [[Valhalla, New York]] ([[Westchester County]]).

By December 2005, Clarence could walk short distances unassisted, and Carl could walk with a walker. As of August 2014 both boys and their mother live in a donated house in [[Scarsdale, New York]]. The twins continue to attend [[physical therapy]] at Blythedale. Goodrich says there was some degeneration of Carl’s right parietal lobe: he takes medication to control seizures, can utter just a word or two at a time, and has limited use of his left arm and leg. Both must still wear helmets to protect their brains; when they are fully grown, their skulls will be patched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2714913/Formerly-conjoined-twins-connected-brain-withered-died-not-separated-celebrate-10-YEARS-doctors-allowed-unique-individuals.html (3 August 2014) "Formerly conjoined twins who were connected at the brain and would have 'withered and died' if not separated celebrate 10 YEARS since doctors allowed them to become unique individuals". Daily Mail. London.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Casa Natal del General Santander''' (lit., "Birth house of General Santander") is the birthplace of the Colombian General [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], and is where he lived until the age of 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museoscolombianos.gov.co/museos-del-ministerio-de-cultura/museo-casa-natal-del-general-santander/Paginas/default.aspx|title=Museo Casa Natal del General Santander|publisher=Colombian Ministry of Culture|language=Spanish|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is in the municipality of [[Villa del Rosario, Norte de Santander|Villa del Rosario]] in [[Cúcuta]], along the International Highway to Venezuela.

The building now holds a museum that contains many of Santander's possessions, including his uniform and swords. The house is in the [[Park of the Great Colombia]], which also contains the [[historic church of Cúcuta]] (where the [[Colombian Constitution of 1821]] was written and signed), and the [[House of the Bagatela]], the seat of Colombia's government in its early years.

They had one child, [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs]].

==Early life==
Brennan was born in [[Dayton, Ohio]], in 1954, one of four daughters of James Richard Brennan and Virginia Lavern Rickey. Chrisann was named after the flower [[chrysanthemum]].&lt;ref name=bite/&gt; Brennan notes in her memoir that she is "[[dyslexia|dyslexic]], which has had the effect of making me differently wired, creative, and a voracious problem solver— bright, but more than slightly clueless to convention."&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;

Her father worked for [[Sylvania (brand)|Sylvania]] and the family lived in a number of places including [[Colorado Springs]] and [[Nebraska]]. They eventually settled in [[Sunnyvale, California]]. Her parents divorced after their move to [[Buffalo, New York]]. Brennan attended [[Homestead High School (Cupertino, California)|Homestead High School]] in [[Cupertino, California]], where she met [[Steve Jobs]] during the early months of 1972.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;

==Relationship with Steve Jobs==
Brennan and Jobs's relationship began in 1972 while they were students in high school together.&lt;ref name=bite/&gt;&lt;ref name="JobsBio1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter | authorlink =Walter Isaacson|title=[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]|year=2011|isbn= |page=ebook|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brennan remained involved with Jobs while he was at [[Reed College]].&lt;ref name="JobsBio1"/&gt; Brennan (who was now a senior at Homestead High School) did not have plans to attend college, and was supportive of Jobs when he told her he planned to drop out of Reed. He continued to attend by auditing classes, but Brennan stopped visiting him. Jobs later asked her to come and live with him in a house he rented near the Reed campus, but she refused. He had started seeing other women, and she was interested in someone she met in her art class. Brennan speculates that the house was Jobs' attempt to make their relationship monogamous again.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;

In mid-1973, Jobs moved back to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Brennan states by this point that their "relationship was complicated. I couldn't break the connection and I couldn't commit. Steve couldn't either." Jobs hitchhiked and worked around the West Coast and Brennan would occasionally join him. At the same time, Brennan notes, "little by little, Steve and I separated. But we were never able to fully let go. We never talked about breaking up or going our separate ways and we didn't have that conversation where one person says it's over." They continued to grow apart, but Jobs would still seek her out, and visit her. They remained involved with each other while continuing to see other people.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;

By early 1974, Jobs was living what Brennan describes as a "simple life" in a [[Los Gatos, California|Los Gatos]] cabin, working at [[Atari]], and saving money for [[Hippie trail|his impending trip]] to [[India]]. Brennan visited him twice at the cabin. Brennan's memories of this cabin consist of Jobs reading ''[[Be Here Now (book)|Be Here Now]]'' (and giving her a copy), listening to [[South Indian culture#Music|South Indian]] music, and using a Japanese meditation pillow. Brennan felt that he was more distant and negative towards her. Brennan states in her memoir that she met with Jobs right before he left for India and that he tried to give her $100 that he had earned at Atari. She initially refused to accept it but eventually accepted the money.&lt;ref name="bite2"&gt;"The morning of the day Steve left for India he came to my house to say good-bye and to give me a $ 100 bill. He had made a bit of money at Atari and he just wanted to give me this gift. I hadn't seen him in a while and was standing with my new boyfriend at the entrance to the apartment when Steve walked up. Steve touched my forehead to indicate that I was his, which I found outrageous. When I objected to the money, Steve demanded I not play the game of rejecting it. Steve was nothing if not ceremonial in his passages and this money was about him, not me, so I took it and thanked him." In {{cite book |last=Brennan |first=Chrisann |date= |title=[[The Bite in the Apple|THE BITE IN THE APPLE:A Memoir of My Life with Steve Jobs]] |url= |location= |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |page=ebook |isbn= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Brennan graduated from high school Jobs invited her to come and see him at the [[Robert Friedland#Early life and education|All One Farm]], a [[History of the hippie movement#New Communalism|commune]] in [[Oregon]]. While she did not spend much time with Jobs (who was recovering from an illness), Brennan was deeply influenced by the experience of meeting and working with the people that she met there.&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;

In early 1975, Brennan became involved with a [[Zen]] Buddhist community in Los Altos, where she accidentally bumped into Jobs (whom she had not seen since the All One Farm). It was through this community that they would both meet and work with the Zen master [[Kōbun Chino Otogawa|Kobun]]. Jobs and Brennan began to spend more time together, although she noted that his behavior with her was more aloof than in the past. Brennan notes their lives were on different paths as she was deeply involved in her art program at [[Foothill College]] where she studied under Gordon Holler&lt;ref name="menlo"/&gt; while Jobs was working with "[[Kōbun Chino Otogawa|Kobun]] and [[Steve Wozniak|Woz]]."&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt; She also fell in love with Greg Calhoun (Jobs' former Reed classmate) who had come to visit from the All One Farm.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1"/&gt; Brennan moved to the All One Farm and lived for a while with Calhoun in a renovated chicken coop. They eventually moved back to the Bay Area to earn money for [[Hippie trail|a trek to India]]. Jobs helped them find a home to rent, though he was opposed to their traveling together to India. After Brennan and Calhoun had earned enough money to go, Jobs drove them to the airport and gave them advice about how to survive in India. Brennan traveled for a year through India with Calhoun, though their relationship ended by the time she returned to the United States.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JobsBio1"/&gt;

==Apple (1977)==
After her return from India, Brennan visited Jobs, whom she now considered just a friend, at his parents' home, where he was still living. It was during this period that Jobs and Brennan fell in love again, as Brennan noted changes in him that she attributes to [[Kōbun Chino Otogawa]], whom she was also still following. It was also at this time that Jobs displayed a prototype [[Apple I|Apple computer]] for Brennan and his parents in their living room. Brennan notes a shift in this time period, where the two main influences on Jobs were [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and Kobun. By the early 1977, she and Jobs would spend time together at her home at [[Hidden Villa|Duveneck Ranch in Los Altos]], which served as a hostel and environmental education center. Brennan also worked there as a teacher for inner city children who came to learn about the farm.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;

As Jobs and Apple became more successful, his relationship with Brennan grew more complex. In 1977 Brennan, [[Daniel Kottke]], and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]]. Brennan notes that Jobs wanted the three of them to live together because, "Steve told me that he didn't want to get a house with just the two of us because it felt insufficient to him. Steve wanted his buddy Daniel to live with him because he believed it would break up the intensity of what wasn't working between us. Our relationship was running hot and cold. We were completely crazy about each other and utterly bored in turns. I had suggested to Steve that we separate, but he told me that he just couldn't bring himself to say good-bye." In addition, Jobs initially suggested that all three of them each have separate rooms. They were still involved with each other, but even then Brennan states that in her memory of the time, "I recalled how awful he was becoming and how I was starting to flounder."&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt; When she moved into the house, she had initially planned to commit to becoming an artist. However, she also needed to find work and eventually took a position at Apple in the Shipping Department (where she was part of a team that tested, assembled, and shipped [[Apple II]]s with Mark Johnson and Bob Martinengo whom she enjoyed working with).&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="standingphoto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/pictures-of-apples-first-employees-2013-12|title=These Pictures Of Apple's First Employees Are Absolutely Wonderful
|accessdate=2015-01-19|last=Edwards|first=Jim|date=2013-12-26|publisher=Business Insider
}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also took art classes at nearby [[De Anza College]].&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;

Brennan's relationship with Jobs was deteriorating as his position with Apple grew and she began to consider ending the relationship. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by Apple employee #5, [[Rod Holt]], who asked her to take "a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples." Both Holt and Jobs felt that it would be a good position for her, given her artistic abilities. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father. It took her a few days to tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan "turned ugly" at the news.  According to Brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: "I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion. I just didn't want to do that."&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt; He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1"/&gt; Brennan, herself, felt confused about what to do. She was estranged from her mother and afraid to discuss the matter with her father. She also did not feel comfortable with the idea of having an abortion. She chose instead to discuss the matter with Kobun, who encouraged her to have and keep the baby as he would lend his support. Meanwhile, Holt was waiting for her decision on the internship. Brennan states that Jobs continued to encourage her to take the internship, stating that she could "be pregnant and work at Apple, you can take the job. I don't get what the problem is." Brennan however notes that she "felt so ashamed: the thought of my growing belly in the professional environment at Apple, with the child being his, while he was unpredictable, in turn being punishing and sentimentally ridiculous. I could not have endured it." Brennan thus turned down the internship and decided to leave Apple. She states that Jobs told her "If you give up this baby for adoption, you will be sorry" and "I am never going to help you."&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;

==Lisa==
Now alone, Brennan was on welfare and cleaning houses to earn money. She would sometimes ask Jobs for money but he always refused. Brennan hid her pregnancy for as long as she could, living in a variety of homes, and continuing her work with Zen meditation. At the same time, according to Brennan, Jobs "started to seed people with the notion that I slept around and he was infertile, which meant that this could not be his child." A few weeks before she was due, Brennan was invited to have her baby at the All One Farm in Oregon and Brennan accepted the offer.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;

At the age of 23, Brennan gave birth to her daughter, [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa Brennan]], on May 17, 1978.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/15/steve-jobs-chrisann-brennan-memoir-apple|title=Steve Jobs' ex-girlfriend pens memoir on life with 'vicious' Apple founder|accessdate=2015-01-17|last=Metz|first=Rachel
|date=2013-10-15|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs initially did not come for the birth. He eventually did so after he was contacted by [[Robert Friedland]], their mutual friend and owner of the All One Farm. While distant, Jobs worked with her on a name for the baby. Brennan suggested the name "Lisa" and notes that Jobs was very attached to the name "Lisa" while he "was also publicly denying paternity." She would discover later that Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name. She states that she never gave him permission to use the baby's name for a computer and he hid the plans from her. Jobs also worked with his team to come up with the phrase, "Local Integrated Software Architecture" as an alternative explanation for the [[Apple Lisa]]&lt;ref name="Bullock"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minyanville.com/special-features/articles/lisa-brennan-jobs-business-icons-rich/8/31/2010/id/29768|archiveurl= |title= The Kids of Business Icons: Lisa Brennan-Jobs |last=Bullock |first= Diane |date=August 31, 2010|archivedate= |work=[[Minyanville]] |pages=|accessdate=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (decades later, however, Jobs admitted to his biographer [[Walter Isaacson]] that "obviously, it was named for my daughter"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter | authorlink=Walter Isaacson|title=[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]|year=2011|isbn= 1-4516-4853-7 |page=93|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Brennan did explore adoption both before and after Lisa's birth but ultimately decided to become a single parent. Once, while staying with friends in the Bay Area, Jobs stopped by to see her. Brennan states that they went for a walk when Jobs said to her, "I am really sorry. I'll be back, this thing with Apple will be over when I'm about thirty. I am really, really sorry." Around the same time, she met with Kobun who distanced himself from her and did not fulfill his promise to help her once the baby was born.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;

Brennan would come under intense criticism from Jobs, who claimed that "she doesn't want money, she just wants me." According to Brennan, Apple's [[Michael Scott (Apple)|Mike Scott]] wanted Jobs to give her money, while other Apple executives "advised him to ignore me or fight if I tried to go after a paternity settlement." Brennan also notes that later, after Jobs was forced out of Apple, "he apologized many times over for this behavior. He said that he never took responsibility when he should have and that he was sorry."&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt; By this time, Jobs had developed a strong relationship with Lisa, who wanted her name changed{{clarify|date=November 2016}} and Jobs agreed. So he had her name on her birth certificate changed from Lisa Brennan to Lisa Brennan-Jobs.&lt;ref name="bitecert"&gt;"Fast-forward six years when Lisa was nine, after she and her father had grown to know and love each other … It was in that window of time that Steve and Lisa decided to get her birth certificate straightened out. At nine, Lisa went from Lisa Brennan to Lisa Brennan-Jobs. Steve told me that he could hardly believe that she wanted to take his name. Very plainly relieved and honest, he said, 'I am just so happy that she does' … William Fenwick of Fenwick &amp; West was the lawyer Steve used to fact-check and change the birth certificate." In {{cite book |last=Brennan |first=Chrisann |date= |title=[[The Bite in the Apple|THE BITE IN THE APPLE:A Memoir of My Life with Steve Jobs]] |url= |location= |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |page=ebook |isbn= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lisa was a baby and Jobs continued to deny paternity, a [[DNA paternity testing|DNA paternity test]] was given that established him as Lisa's father. He was required to give Brennan $385 a month and return the money she had received from welfare. Jobs gave her $500 a month at the time when Apple went public, and Jobs became a millionaire. Brennan worked as a waitress in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]. Later, Brennan agreed to give an interview with [[Michael Moritz]] for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]].'' It would be for its 1982 [[Time Person of the Year]] special (released on January 3, 1983). She decided to be honest about her relationship with Jobs. The ''Time'' magazine issue had a lifelong impact on Brennan. Rather than give Jobs the "Person of the Year" award, ''Time'' offered the award of "Machine of the Year: The Computer Moves In."&lt;ref&gt;''Machine of the Year: The Computer Moves in.'' [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'', January 3, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; In the issue, Jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test (which stated that the "probability of paternity for Jobs, Steven... is 94.1%").&lt;ref name="machineofthe year1"&gt;Cocks Jay. Reported by Michael Moritz. "[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953633,00.html The Updated Book of Jobs]" in ''Machine of the Year: The Computer Moves in.'' [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'', January 3, 1983:27.&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs responded by arguing that "28% of the male population of the United States could be the father."&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="machineofthe year1"/&gt; ''Time'' also noted that "the baby girl and the machine on which Apple has placed so much hope for the future share the same name: Lisa."&lt;ref name="machineofthe year1"/&gt; After this issue, Brennan "didn't pay much attention to Steve's career again."&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;''

Over the years, however, Brennan and Jobs developed a working relationship to co-parent Lisa, particularly after he was forced out of Apple. Brennan credits the change in him to the influence of his newly found biological sister, [[Mona Simpson]], who worked to repair the relationship between Lisa and Jobs.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;

According to ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', Brennan wrote a letter to Jobs in 2005, and another in 2009, in which she said she would abandon writing her memoirs if Jobs would supply her with financial compensation of $28 million USD for the suffering she went through as a single mother.&lt;ref name=Fortune2015-08-06&gt;{{cite news|url = http://fortune.com/2015/08/06/steve-jobs-apple-girlfriend/|title = When Steve Jobs' ex-girlfriend asked him to pay $25 million for his "dishonorable behavior"|publisher = [[Fortune Magazine]]|date = 2015-08-05|author = Peter Elkind|accessdate = 2015-11-01|quote = In his estate, Jobs left their daughter a multi-million-dollar inheritance, which Lisa has used to help support her, according to Brennan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painter==
During the late 1980s, Brennan decided to finish her formal education and began to study at the [[California College of the Arts|California College of Arts and Crafts]] (where she was able to transfer her units from [[Foothill College]]).&lt;ref name="menlo"/&gt; She asked Jobs to pay her tuition. He agreed to this request and according to Brennan was quite happy to do so, as part of his developing relationship with Lisa. In 1989, she transferred to the [[San Francisco Art Institute]].&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;

Brennan is currently a painter who lives in [[Monterey, California]].&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt; She describes her art as "light encoded paintings" and works mostly on commission for either private or corporate parties.&lt;ref name="menlo"/&gt; She has also created murals for the [[Ronald McDonald House Charities|Ronald McDonald House]], [[LAC+USC Medical Center|Los Angeles County Hospital]], [[Massachusetts General Hospital|Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Brennan states that painting is "a language for me. Letters are form, and paintings are documents for information. When I mix those two, I'm happy. It gets me out of the normal way, which is what I want to do."&lt;ref name="menlo"/&gt;

'''Darcy G. Richardson''' (born December 6, 1955) is an American [[author]], [[historian]] and [[political activist]].

He was the [[Reform Party of Florida]]'s nominee for governor in [[Florida gubernatorial election, 2018|2018]]. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]], Richardson challenged incumbent [[Barack Obama]] for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination for [[president of the United States]] in five state primaries.

==Author and activist==
Richardson is the author of ''A Nation Divided: The 1968 Presidential Campaign'', published in 2002. The book describes in detail the "Clean for Gene" phenomenon that led to President [[Lyndon B.

==Political campaigns==

In 1988, the [[Citizens Party (United States)|Consumer Party]] again nominated Richardson, this time to run for [[U.S. Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2stRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3W0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3824,2604379&amp;dq=darcy-richardson&amp;hl=en | title=Heinz well on road to win | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | date=November 9, 1988 | accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Richardson was the national campaign manager of former Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s presidential campaign. McCarthy was also running on the Consumer Party ticket.

[[File:Andr22.jpg|thumb|''The Abduction of Ganymede'' (ca. 1650), by [[Eustache Le Sueur]]]]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Ganymede''' or '''Ganymedes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|æ|n|ɪ|ˌ|m|iː|d}};&lt;ref name="collins_english"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/ganymede |title=English Dictionary: Definition of Ganymede |publisher=Collins |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|æ|n|ɪ|m|iː|d}};&lt;ref name="collins_american"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/ganymede |title=American English Dictionary: Definition of Ganymede |publisher=Collins |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Γανυμήδης}}, ''Ganymēdēs'') is a [[Greek hero|divine hero]] whose homeland was [[Troy]]. He was the son of [[Tros (mythology)|Tros]] of Dardania, from whose name "Troy" was supposedly derived, and of [[Callirhoe (Greek mythology)|Callirrhoe]], the daughter of the river god [[Scamander]]. Ganymede was the brother of  [[Ilus]], [[Assaracus]] and [[Cleopatra (Greek myth)|Cleopatra]]. [[Homer]] describes Ganymede as the most beautiful of mortals, and in one version of the myth [[Zeus]] falls in love with his beauty and abducts him in the form of an eagle to serve as [[cup-bearer]] in [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]]. 

{{Quote|text=[Ganymedes] was the loveliest born of the race of mortals, and therefore&lt;br /&gt;the gods caught him away to themselves, to be Zeus' wine-pourer,&lt;br /&gt;for the sake of his beauty, so he might be among the immortals.|author=[[Homer]]|source=''[[Iliad]]'', Book XX, lines 233-235.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Lattimore|Lattimore, Richard]], trans. The Iliad of Homer. Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The myth was a model for the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek social custom of ''paiderastía'']], the socially acceptable romantic relationship between an adult male and an adolescent male. The Latin form of the name was '''Catamitus''' (and also "Ganymedes"), from which the English word "[[catamite]]" is derived.&lt;ref&gt;According to ''[[AMHER]]'' (2000), ''catamite'', p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myth==
Ganymede was abducted by [[Zeus]] from [[Mount Ida (Turkey)|Mount Ida]], near Troy in [[Phrygia]].&lt;ref&gt;Idaea was a [[oread|mountain nymph]], mate of the river god [[Scamander]], and mother of [[King Teucer]] a primeval [[Troy|Trojan]] king. On the same sacred mountain [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] lived in similar exile as a shepherd on Mount Ida, for his disastrous future effect on Troy had been foretold at his birth, and Priam had him [[Infanticide#Greece and Rome|exposed]] on the sacred slopes.&lt;/ref&gt; Ganymede had been tending sheep, a rustic or humble pursuit characteristic of a hero's boyhood before his privileged status is revealed. Zeus either summoned an [[eagle]] or turned into an eagle himself to transport the youth to Mount Olympus.

[[File:Rilievo con ganimede, fine I sec. dc. 01.JPG|thumb|left|Roman-era [[relief]] depicting the eagle of Zeus abducting Ganymede, his [[Phrygian cap]] denoting an eastern origin, and a river god]]
In the ''[[Iliad]]'', Zeus is said to have compensated Ganymede's father Tros by the gift of fine horses, "the same that carry the immortals",&lt;ref&gt;The [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] [[Diomedes]] is keen to capture the horses of [[Aeneas]] because "they are of the stock that great Jove&lt;!--Why the Roman form?--&gt; gave to [[Tros (mythology)|Tros]] in payment for his son Ganymede, and are the finest that live and move under the sun": ''Iliad'' 5.265ff.&lt;/ref&gt; delivered by the messenger god [[Hermes]]. Tros was consoled that his son was now immortal and would be the cupbearer for the gods, a position of much distinction. [[Walter Burkert]] found a precedent for the Ganymede myth on an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] seal that depicts the hero-king [[Etana]] riding heavenwards on an eagle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age'', 1992, p. 122; Burkert notes that there is no direct iconographic link.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Olympus, Zeus granted him eternal youth and immortality and the office of cupbearer to the gods, who was relived of her duties as cupbearer upon her marriage to the [[Heracles|Herakles]]. [[Edmund Veckenstedt]] associated Ganymede with the genesis of the intoxicating drink [[mead]], which had a traditional origin in Phrygia.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Veckenstedt, ''Ganymedes'', Libau, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; All the gods were filled with joy to see the youth, except for [[Hera]], Zeus's consort, who regarded Ganymede as a rival for her husband's affection. Zeus later put Ganymede in the sky as the [[constellation]] [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] ( the "water-carrier" or "cup-carrier"), which is associated with that of the Eagle ([[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]]). A moon of [[Jupiter]], the planet named after Zeus's Roman counterpart, was named [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] by the German astronomer [[Simon Marius]].&lt;ref&gt;Marius/Schlör, ''Mundus Iovialis'', p. 78 f. (with misprint ''In'' for ''Io'')&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ganymedes Zeus MET L.1999.10.14.jpg|thumb|Ganymede pouring Zeus a libation (Attic red-figure calyx krater by the [[Eucharides Painter]], c. 490–480 BCE)]]
[[Plato]] accounts for the pederastic aspect of the myth by attributing its origin to [[Crete]], where the social custom of ''paiderastía'' was supposed to have originated (see "[[Cretan pederasty]]").&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]''  636D, as cited by Thomas Hubbard, ''Homosexuality in Greece and Rome,'' p252&lt;/ref&gt;    [[Athenaeus]] ecorded a version of the myth were Ganymede was abducted by the legendary [[Minos|King Minos]] to serve as his cupbearer instead of Zeus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koehl|first=Robert B.|date=1986|title=The Chieftain Cup and a Minoan Rite of Passage|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/629645|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|publisher=The Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies|volume=106|pages=99-110|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have equated this version of the myth to Cretan pederasty practices, as recorded by [[Strabo]] and [[Ephorus|Ephoros]], that involved abduction of a youth by an older lover for a period of two months before the youth was able to re-enter society as a man.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Xenophon]] portrays [[Socrates]] as denying that Ganymede was the ''catamite'' of Zeus, and instead asserting that the god loved him for his ''psychē'', "mind" or "soul," giving the etymology of his name as ''ganu-'', "taking pleasure," and ''mēd-'', "mind." Xenophon's Socrates points out that Zeus did not grant any of his lovers immortality, but that he did grant immortality to Ganymede.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''[[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0212%3Atext%3DSym.%3Achapter%3D8%3Asection%3D29 8.29&amp;ndash;30]; Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

In poetry, Ganymede became a symbol for the beautiful young male who attracted homosexual desire and love. He is not always portrayed as acquiescent: in the ''[[Argonautica]]'' of [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], Ganymede is furious at the god [[Eros]] for having cheated him at the game of chance played with [[knucklebones]], and [[Aphrodite]] scolds her son for "cheating a beginner." The [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan poet]] [[Virgil]] portrays the abduction with pathos: the boy's aged tutors try in vain to draw him back to Earth, and his hounds bay uselessly at the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'' V 256–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The loyal hounds left calling after their abducted master is a frequent motif in visual depictions, and is referenced also by [[Statius]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Here the Phrygian hunter is borne aloft on tawny wings, [[Gargara]]’s range sinks downwards as he rises, and Troy grows dim beneath him; sadly stand his comrades; vainly the hounds weary their throats with barking, pursue his shadow or bay at the clouds."''&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''[[Thebaid (Latin poem)|Thebaid]]'' 1.549.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In the arts==

===Ancient===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
[[File:Berlin Painter Ganymedes Louvre G175.jpg|thumb|Ganymede rolling a hoop and bearing aloft a [[cockerel]], a love-gift&lt;ref&gt;For the cockerel as an emblematic gift to the ''[[eromenos]]'', see, for example, H.A. Shapiro, "Courtship scenes in Attic vase-painting", ''American Journal of Archaeology'', 1981; the gift is "gender specific, and it is clear that the cock had significance as evocative of male potency", T.J. Figueira observes, in reviewing two recent works on Greek pederasty, in ''American Journal of Archaeology'', 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; from Zeus, who is pictured in pursuit on the obverse of a vase by the Berlin Painter ([[Attica|Attic]] [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] [[krater]], 500&amp;ndash;490 BCE)]]
One of the earliest depictions of Ganymede is a red-figure [[krater]] by the [[Berlin Painter]] in the [[Musée du Louvre]].&lt;ref name=www.louvre.fr&gt;{{cite web|title=www.louvre.fr|url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/attic-red-figure-bell-krater}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeus pursues Ganymede on one side, while on the other side the youth runs away, [[Hoop rolling|rolling along a hoop]] while holding aloft a crowing cock. In fifth-century Athens, vase-painters often depicted the mythological story, which was so suited to the all-male [[symposium]] or formal banquet. The Ganymede myth was treated in recognizable contemporary terms, illustrated with common behavior of homoerotic courtship rituals, as on a vase by the "Achilles Painter" where Ganymede also flees with a cock. Ganymede is usually depicted as a well-developed, muscular young man.
[[Leochares]] (about 350 BCE), a Greek sculptor of Athens who was engaged with Scopas on the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]] cast a (lost) bronze group of Ganymede and the Eagle, a work that was held remarkable for its ingenious composition, which boldly ventured to the verge of what is allowed by the laws of sculpture, and also for its charming treatment of the youthful form as it soars into the air. It is apparently [[commons:Category:Copy of the Leochares Ganymede in the Vatican Museums| imitated in a well-known marble group in the Vatican, half life-size]]. Such [[Hellenistic]] gravity-defying feats were influential in the sculpture of the [[Baroque]].

===Renaissance and Baroque===
In Shakespeare's ''[[As You Like It]]'' (1599), a comedy of mistaken identity in the magical setting of the [[Forest of Arden]], Celia, dressed as a shepherdess, becomes "Aliena" (Latin "stranger", Ganymede's sister) and Rosalind, because she is "more than common tall", dresses up as a boy, Ganymede, a well-known image to the audience. She plays on her ambiguous charm to seduce Orlando, but also (involuntarily) the shepherdess Phoebe. Thus behind the conventions of Elizabethan theater in its original setting, the young boy playing the girl Rosalind dresses up as a boy and is then courted by another boy playing Phoebe.

When painter-architect [[Baldassare Peruzzi]] included a panel of ''The Rape of Ganymede'' in a ceiling at the Villa Farnesina, Rome, (''ca'' 1509–1514), Ganymede's long blond hair and girlish pose make him identifiable at first glance, though he grasps the eagle's wing without resistance. In [[Antonio da Correggio|Antonio Allegri Correggio]]'s ''Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle'' ([[Vienna]]) Ganymede's grasp is more intimate. [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]' version portrays a young man. But when [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]] painted the ''Rape of Ganymede'' for a Dutch Calvinist patron in 1635, a dark eagle carries aloft a plump cherubic baby (Paintings Gallery, Dresden) who is bawling and urinating in fright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfoot|first1=C.C.|last2=Todd|first2=Richard|title=The Great Emporium : the Low Countries as cultural crossroads in the Renaissance and the eighteenth century|publisher=Editions Rodopi B.V.|location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1685 statue of Ganymede and Zeus entitled ''Ganymède Médicis'' by Pierre Laviron stands in the gardens of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].

Examples of Ganymede in 18th century France have been studied by Michael Preston Worley.&lt;ref&gt;Worley, "The Image of Ganymede in France, 1730–1820: The Survival of a Homoerotic Myth," ''Art Bulletin'' '''76''' (December 1994: 630–643).&lt;/ref&gt; The image of Ganymede was invariably that of a naive adolescent accompanied by an eagle and the homoerotic aspects of the legend were rarely dealt with. In fact, the story was often "heterosexualized." Moreover, the Neoplatonic interpretation of the myth, so common in the Italian Renaissance, in which the rape of Ganymede represented the ascent to spiritual perfection, seemed to be of no interest to Enlightenment philosophers and mythographers. [[Jean-Baptiste Marie Pierre]], [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]], [[Guillaume Coustou the Younger|Guillaume II Coustou]], [[Pierre Julien]], [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]] and others contributed images of Ganymede to French art during this period.

[[File:Ganímedes (José Álvarez Cubero) MRABASF 01.jpg|thumb|Ganymede (1804) by [[José Álvarez Cubero]]]]

*[[José Álvarez Cubero]]'s sculpture of Ganymede, executed in Paris in 1804, brought the Spanish sculptor immediate recognition as one of the leading sculptors of his day.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Alvarez, Don José}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Vollmer's ''Wörterbuch der Mythologie aller Völker'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vollmer-mythologie.de/ganymedes/ |title=Vollmer-mythologie.de |publisher=Vollmer-mythologie.de |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Stuttgart, 1874) illustrates "Ganymede" by an engraving of a "Roman relief," showing a seated bearded Zeus who holds the cup aside to draw a naked Ganymede into his embrace. That engraving however was nothing but a copy of [[Anton Raphael Mengs|Raphael Mengs]]'s counterfeit Roman fresco, painted as a practical joke on the eighteenth-century art critic [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Johann Winckelmann]] who was growing desperate in his search for homoerotic Greek and Roman antiquities. This story is very briefly told by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] in his ''Italienische Reise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textlog.de/7116.html |title=Textlog.de |publisher=Textlog.de |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*At [[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth]] in the nineteenth century the bachelor [[Duke of Devonshire]] added to his sculpture gallery [[Adamo Tadolini]]'s [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassic]] "Ganymede and the Eagle," in which a luxuriously reclining Ganymede, embraced by one wing, prepares to exchange a peck with the eagle. The delicate cup in his hand is made of gilt-bronze, lending an unsettling immediacy and realism to the white marble group.
*In the early years of the twentieth century, the topos of Ganymede's abduction by Zeus was drafted into the service of commercial enterprise. Adapting an 1892 lithograph by [[Frank Kirchbach]], the brewery of [[Anheuser-Busch]] launched in 1904 an ad campaign publicizing the successes of [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] beer. Collectibles featuring the graphics of the poster continued to be produced into the early 1990s.
*The poem “[[Ganymed (Goethe)|Ganymed]]” &lt;!--Ganymed is correct--&gt; by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe|Goethe]] was set to music by [[Franz Schubert]] in 1817; published in his Opus 19, no. 3 (D. 544). Also set by Hugo Wolf.
*The Portuguese sculptor [https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/António_Fernandes_de_Sá António Fernandes de Sá] represented the [https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Fernandes_de_S%C3%A1#/media/File:Rapto_de_Ganimedes_Fernandes_S%C3%A1_Porto_Portugal_02.jpg abduction of Ganymede] in 1898. The sculpture can be found in [https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jardim_de_João_Chagas Jardim da Cordoaria], in [[Porto]] ([[Portugal]]).
*In stories by [[P. G. Wodehouse]], the [[Junior Ganymede Club|Junior Ganymede]] is a servants' club, analogous to the [[Drones Club|Drones]], to which [[Jeeves]] belongs. Wodehouse named it after Ganymede presumably in reference to his role of cup-bearer.
*Ganymede is a reluctant music fan in [[Kurtis Blow]]'s 1980 song "Way Out West". After hours of rap by "The Stranger" (Kurtis), he eventually gets up to dance.
*American artist [[Henry Oliver Walker]] painted a mural in the [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington D.C.]] circa 1900, depicting an adolescent, nude Ganymede on the back of an eagle.
*Ganymede and the god [[Dionysus]] make an appearance in ''Everworld VI: Fear the Fantastic'', of [[K.A. Applegate]]'s [[fantasy]] series [[Everworld]]. Ganymede is described as attracting both males and females.

&lt;blockquote&gt;My first thought, my first flash was that it was a beautiful woman.... The angel was beautiful, with a face dominated by immense, lustrous green eyes and framed by golden ringlets, and with a bow mouth and full lips and brilliant white teeth.&lt;br/&gt;
And only then, only after I had felt that first rush of improbable carnal lust, did it occur to me that this angel was a man.&lt;ref&gt;[[K. A. Applegate|Applegate, K. A.]], ''Everworld VI: Fear the Fantastic'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Ganymede Waters Zeus as an Eagle by Thorvaldsen.jpg|thumb|''Ganymede Waters [[Zeus]] as an Eagle'' by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] (Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Minneapolis, MN)]]
*In 1959 [[Robert Rauschenberg]] referenced the myth in one of his best-known works, ''Canyon'' and in another work, ''Pail for Ganymede''. In "Canyon", a photo of Rauschenberg's son Christopher beautifully reiterates the infant portrayed by Rembrandt in the 17th century. A stuffed eagle emerges from the flat picture plane with a pillow tied to a piece of string very near his claw. The pillow also reflects upon the young boy's body and Rembrandt's painting.
*[[Felice Picano]]'s 1981 novel ''[[An Asian Minor]]'' reinvents the story of Ganymede.
*In [[Anne Rice]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Of Love and Evil]]'', she refers to a troop of young boys, acting as cup-bearers at a party, as Ganymedes.
*In the 2016 video game ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]],'' the character Bastion has a bird named Ganymede.
*A character in the [[Terra Ignota (series)|Terra Ignota]] series by Ada Palmer is named Ganymede de la Trémoille
*The opening of [[Will Self]]'s 2017 novel ''[[Phone (Will Self novel)|Phone]]'' refers to 'agents of Ganymede' (p.6) to explore caution within the homosexual community in previous decades.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4414">'''George Spelvin''', '''Georgette Spelvin''', and '''Georgina Spelvin''' are traditional [[pseudonym]]s used in programs in American [[theater]]. The reasons for the use of an alternate name vary. Actors who do not want to be credited, or whose names would otherwise appear twice because they are playing more than one role in a production, may adopt a pseudonym. Actors who are members of the [[AFL-CIO]] trade union of professional actors known as [[Actors' Equity Association]], but are working under a non-union contract and wish to avoid the significant penalties ranging from substantial fines to revocation of union membership that could result from working under non-union contracts, also use pseudonyms.

In some plays, this name has appeared in cast lists as the name of an actor (or actress) portraying a [[unseen character|character who is mentioned in the dialogue but never turns up onstage]]: with the role credited to "George Spelvin", the audience is not forewarned that the character never makes an entrance.  The name is said to have first appeared on a cast list in 1886 in ''Karl the Peddler'', a play by Charles A. Gardiner. The 1927 musical play ''Strike Up the Band'' by George S. Kaufman and George and Ira Gershwin features a character named George Spelvin. The name can also be used when one actor is playing what appear to be two characters, but is later revealed as being one person with two names or identities.  Because of the pseudonym, the audience is not clued-in that the two seemingly separate characters are meant to be the same person.  This is especially useful in murder mysteries.

"Georgina Spelvin" has fallen out of general use since it was adopted as a screen name by [[pornographic actress]] [[Georgina Spelvin|Shelley Graham]], who was credited by that name in ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'' (1973) and her subsequent films.

Another example of the name being used occurred in Players de Noc's production of ''[[The Full Monty]]'', about a group of men who try their luck as male strippers.  A member of the production's orchestra, not wanting members of his church to find he was involved with such a risqué play, had his name credited as George Spelvin.

The one-act play ''[[The Actor's Nightmare]]'' by [[Christopher Durang]] features a main character named George Spelvin, and the January 27, 1942, episode of ''[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]'' ("The Blizzard") features a visit by a stranger calling himself George Spelvin (played by [[Frank Nelson (actor)|Frank Nelson]]).

The columnist [[Westbrook Pegler]] used this name in his writings; one of his books of collected columns is titled ''George Spelvin, American''.

The name was used in the ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' episode "Don Juan is Shelved", in the ''[[Mama's Family]]'' episode "Fangs A Lot, Mama" as the author of a book called ''A Nun's Life'', and as the name of a character villain voiced by [[Peter Serafinowicz]] in the "Tragical History" episode of ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]''. 

The name may also be used for a character who never delivers a line, and thus any member of the stage crew might be filling in the role. For example, a person makes a delivery to a character onstage: the doorbell rings, the delivery is made, and the delivery carrier disappears, with no words spoken.

'''Francis Gregory Stafford''' (February 9, 1948 – October 11, 2018), usually known as '''Greg Stafford''', was an [[Americans|American]] [[game designer]], [[publisher]], and practitioner of [[shamanism]].

Stafford is most famous as the creator of the fantasy world of [[Glorantha]], but he is also a prolific games designer. He was designer of ''[[Pendragon RPG|Pendragon]]'', he was co-designer of the ''[[RuneQuest]]'', Ghostbusters, Prince Valiant and ''[[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|HeroQuest]]'' [[role-playing game system|role-playing systems]], founder of the role-playing game companies [[Chaosium]] and [[Issaries, Inc.|Issaries]], designer of the ''[[White Bear and Red Moon]]'', ''[[Nomad Gods]]'', ''King Arthur’s Knights'' and ''Elric'' [[board game]]s, and co-designer of the ''[[King of Dragon Pass]]'' [[computer game]].

==Gaming industry career==
===1970s–: Chaosium ===
Greg Stafford began wargaming after picking up a copy of ''U-Boat'' by [[Avalon Hill]], and in 1966 as a freshman at [[Beloit College]] he started writing about the fantasy world of [[Glorantha]].&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons: A History of the Roleplaying Game Industry|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}} After rejection from a publisher, Stafford created ''[[White Bear and Red Moon]]'' set in Glorantha, and after three different companies were unable to publish the game he created [[Chaosium]].&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|82}} He derived the name partly from his home, which was near the [[Oakland Coliseum]], and combining "coliseum" with "chaos."&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|82}}

''White Bear and Red Moon'' (1975) was Chaosium's first published game,&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|82}} and was also Stafford's first professional game.&lt;ref name="HG"&gt;{{Cite book | contribution=[[Kingmaker (board game)|Kingmaker]] | title=Hobby Games: The 100 Best | last=Stafford | first=Greg | authorlink= | editor-last=Lowder | editor-first=James | editor-link=James Lowder | publisher=[[Green Ronin Publishing]] | year=2007 | pages=164–167 | isbn=978-1-932442-96-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stafford designed the board game ''[[Nomad Gods]]''.&lt;ref name="HG"/&gt; Stafford also designed the wargames ''[[Elric: Battle at the End of Time|Elric]]'' (1977) and ''King Arthur's Knights'' (1978).&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|82}}

Stafford wanted the world of Glorantha to be part of an original role-playing game; this ultimately resulted in [[Steve Perrin]]'s ''[[RuneQuest]]'' (1978), which was set in Glorantha.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|83}}

Stafford and [[Lynn Willis]] simplified the ''RuneQuest'' rules into the 16-page ''[[Basic Role-Playing]]'' (1980).&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|85}} He designed the miniatures game ''Merlin''.&lt;ref name="HG"/&gt; Stafford considers his [[Arthurian]] [[chivalric]] role-playing game ''[[Pendragon (role-playing game)|King Arthur Pendragon]]'' (1985) his masterpiece.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|88}}&lt;ref name="Phantasie"&gt;[http://weltentore.dyndns.org/?Interviews:Greg_Stafford:English_Version Interview with Greg Stafford] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719194323/http://weltentore.dyndns.org/?Interviews:Greg_Stafford:English_Version |date=2009-07-19 }} on ''Phantasie'' website.  URL checked 2008-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt; He co-designed the ''[[Ghostbusters (role-playing game)|Ghostbusters]]'' role-playing game (1986).&lt;ref name="HG"/&gt; 

Stafford designed the ''[[Prince Valiant: The Story-Telling Game|Prince Valiant]]'' roleplaying game (1989), which featured a strong storytelling basis and other innovations.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|90}} Stafford decided to produce a fiction line for ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' after he realized that many [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraft]] fans of the early 1990s had never actually read Lovecraft's fiction but were only familiar with him through ''Call of Cthulhu''.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|91}} Stafford co-designed the computer game ''[[King of Dragon Pass]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name="HG"/&gt;

===1998–: Issaries ===
Stafford left Chaosium in 1998, taking all of the rights for Glorantha, and founded the game company [[Issaries, Inc.|Issaries]].&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|94}}

Stafford approached [[Robin Laws]] to create a new game based on Glorantha, which became known as ''[[Hero Wars]]'', published in 2000 as the first fully professional product for Issaries.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|361}} Stafford published the second edition in 2003 under the name he always wanted ''[[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|HeroQuest]]'', as Milton Bradley's trademark on the name had lapsed.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|362}} Stafford moved to Mexico in 2004, bringing production from Issaries to an end.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|363}}

===Later years===
When Hasbro let the ''RuneQuest'' trademark lapse, Stafford picked up the rights to the game and licensed [[Mongoose Publishing]] to publish a new edition in 2006.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|363}} After [[White Wolf Publishing|White Wolf]] acquired the rights to ''[[Pendragon RPG|''Pendragon'']]'',  it was republished in 2005 by White Wolf. Their ArtHaus imprint published ''The Great Pendragon Campaign'' (2006), in which Stafford detailed the massive RPG campaign from the years 485 to 566.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|228}} After Nocturnal Games picked up the rights to ''Pendragon'', Stafford created a 5.1 edition of ''Pendragon'' (2010).&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|230}}

He moved from [[Berkeley, California]] to [[Arcata, California]] in 2007, having lived in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] for some years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cita web|url=http://www.staffordcodex.com/about-me/|title=About me|author=Greg Stafford|website=staffordcodex.com/|accessdate=2018-10-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181013082318/http://www.staffordcodex.com/about-me/|archivedate=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, it was announced that Greg and [[Sandy Petersen]] had returned to Chaosium Inc., Stafford taking the positions of President and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GREG STAFFORD &amp; SANDY PETERSEN REJOIN CHAOSIUM INC.|url=http://www.chaosium.com/blog/greg-stafford-sandy-petersen-rejoin-chaosium-inc/|date=2015-06-02|accessdate=2015-06-03|first=Greg|last=Stafford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glorantha==
{{main|Glorantha}}
{{refimprove-section|date=October 2018}}
Greg Stafford's interest in roleplaying and gaming originated in his adolescent fascination with [[mythology]]. During his adolescent years he read anything he could find on the subject, and when he exhausted the libraries, he started to write his own stories in his freshman year at [[Beloit College]], in 1966. This was the start of the world of Glorantha.

Stafford's 1974 board game ''White Bear and Red Moon'' had featured the violent struggle between several cultures in the Dragon Pass region of Glorantha. The heart of the game was a conflict between the [[barbarian]] Kingdom of Sartar and the invading Lunar Empire, a theme which has remained central to Gloranthan publications since then.

As Stafford was founding his company Chaosium, the game ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (and the concept of [[tabletop role-playing game]]s) was gaining great popularity. Role-players were keen to use the ''White Bear and Red Moon'' setting in such games. So Chaosium published ''[[RuneQuest]]'', written by "[[Steve Perrin]], Ray Turney, and Friends". Stafford left Chaosium in 1998.

For some years, Stafford slowly wrote several [[novel]]s set in Glorantha. Novels that he is known to have been working on are ''Harmast's Saga'', ''Arkat's Saga'', and his "Lunar novel".

He was one of the designers on the Glorantha-based video game "''[[King of Dragon Pass]]''".&lt;ref name="RPGnet review"&gt;[http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_2592.html Review of King of Dragon Pass, rpg.net] URL checked 2011-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shamanism-related works==

Stafford was a practicing shaman and member of the board of directors of ''[[Shaman's Drum]]'', a journal of experiential shamanism.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He had some short articles of Arthurian interest published.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Stafford lived in [[Mexico]] for 18 months, tutoring English as a foreign language, and exploring places of archeological and shamanic interest.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Honors and reception==
Fantasy author [[David A. Hargrave]] pays homage to Stafford in the [[Arduin]] series of supplements, the most widely known example of this being the [[Arduin#Greg Stafford and Chaosium|Stafford's Star Bridge]] 9th-Level [[wizard (character class)|mage]] spell ([[Arduin]] I, page 41).{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Stafford was inducted in the [[Origins Award]] hall of fame in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.originsawards.net/hall-of-fame/|title=Hall of Fame|work=The Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design|accessdate=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1999 ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' magazine named Greg Stafford one of The Millennium's Most Influential Persons, "at least in the realm of adventure gaming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Second Sight: The Millennium's Best "Other" Game and The Millennium's Most Influential Person|journal=[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]] (online)|url=http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/login/article.html?id=1306|last=Haring|first=Scott D.|date=1999-12-24|accessdate=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stafford won the [[Diana Jones Award]] in 2007, for ''The Great Pendragon Campaign'', published by [[White Wolf Publishing|White Wolf]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dianajonesaward.org/the-2007-award/|title=The 2007 Award|website=The Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gamig|accessdate=2018-10-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411075745/http://www.dianajonesaward.org/the-2007-award/|archivedate=2018-04-11|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 for  ''Guide to Glorantha'', coauthored with Jeff Richard and [[Sandy Petersen]] and published by [[Moon Design Publications]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dianajonesaward.org/the-2015-award/|title=The 2015 Award|website=The Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gamig|accessdate=2018-10-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323131234/http://www.dianajonesaward.org:80/the-2015-award/|archivedate=2018-03-23|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was honored as a "famous game designer" by being featured as the king of hearts in [[Flying Buffalo]]'s 2011 Famous Game Designers Playing Card Deck.&lt;ref name="buffalo_dec"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/pokerdeck.htm| title=Poker Deck| publisher=Flying Buffalo| accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ural Mountains]] extend from the [[Arctic Ocean]] in the north to the [[Ural River]] and northwestern [[Kazakhstan]] in the south over a distance of {{convert|1500|mi|km|abbr=on}}, the boundary between Europe and Asia. Human occupation begins in the [[Paleolithic]] and continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-ural.ru/kamenniy-vek/4-chelovek-na-urale-v-epohu-paleolita.html |title=Ural History - Humans in the Ural since the Paleolithic era (300-100 thousand years ago)Человек на Урале в эпоху палеолита (300—100 тыс. лет — 10 тыс. лет назад) | publisher=history-ural | date= | accessdate=December 24, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earliest presence is documented for the ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]''. Although no Neanderthal fossils were ever discovered, stone tools found at ''Byzovaya'', that date to 33,000 years ago are attributed to the [[Mousterian]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/05/110513-neanderthals-last-stand-science-tool-kit-russia-slimak-tools/ |title=Neanderthals Made a Last Stand at Subarctic Outpost? | publisher= national geographic | date=May 15, 2011 | accessdate=December 24, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous people, that migrated in the prehistoric era belong to the [[Ural-Altaic language families]], such as [[Finno-Ugric]],  [[Komi peoples|Komi]], [[Udmurts]], [[Khants]], [[Mansi people|Mansi]]; [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyeds]] - [[Nenets people|Nenets]]; [[Tyurks]] - [[Bashkirs]] and [[Volga Tatars]]. The name "Uralic" derives from the fact that areas where these languages are spoken spread on both sides of the Ural Mountains. Also, the original homeland ([[Urheimat]]) is commonly hypothesized to lie in the vicinity of the Urals. Proto-Uralic is the reconstructed language ancestral to the Uralic language family. The language was originally spoken in a small area about 7,000 to 2,000 years BCE (estimates vary), and expanded to differentiated proto-languages. The exact location of the area or [[Urheimat]] is not known and various strongly differing proposals have been advocated, but the vicinity of the Ural Mountains is usually assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgr.fi/sust/sust253/sust253_janhunen.pdf |title=THE PRIMARY LARYNGEAL IN URALIC AND BEYOND | publisher= JUHA JANHUNEN | date= | accessdate=December 24, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.kh/books?id=d2WcCIm6WaQC&amp;pg=PA1003&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: D-K | publisher= Google Books | date= | accessdate=December 24, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] settlers of the [[Southern Ural]] region arrive during the [[Bronze Age]] and the middle of the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref name="andro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eupedia.com/genetics/andronovo_culture.shtml |title=Andronovo Culture (c. 1800-1400 BCE) | publisher=eupedia | date= | accessdate=December 24, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonization by the [[Russian Empire]] including [[Ukrainians]], [[Germans]] and other peoples begins during the 16th century.

==Prehistory==
Earliest finds are Mousterian stone tools from 33,000 years ago. [[Upper Paleolithic]] [[Cave painting|rock paintings and drawings]] of the [[Kapova Cave]], [[Burzyansky District]] of [[Bashkortostan]] in the southern [[Ural mountains]] are 16,000 years old. Artwork comparison suggests a commonality of cultural processes from the Atlantic to the Ural in the [[Paleolithic era]]. Identified are more than 50 drawings by S. Lyahnitskogo of the Russian Geological Institute and the Russian Geographical Society. Drawings are executed with [[ochre]] - natural pigments on the basis of animal fat, that depict mammoths, horses and other animals, complex characters and anthropomorphic figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proza.ru/2010/12/22/1360%20The%20real%20story%20of%20Russia%20Kapova%20Cave |title=The real story of Russia Kapova Cave | publisher=Proza | date= | accessdate=December 24, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Andronovo culture ===

Trade of the prestigious bronze artifacts from Lake [[Baikal]] to the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] world in the West via Ural waterways correlated with the development of the Southern Ural proto-urban civilization from [[Arkaim]] via [[Sintashta]] to [[Andronovo culture]].
* Flat-bottomed, well smoothed pottery decorated with geometric patterns. Intensive copper and bronze metallurgy with distinctive curved bronze knives and twisted earrings.
* Pit-houses were partly dug into the ground (semi-subterranean), with deep storage pits and corridor-shaped exits. Dwellings were spacious, between {{convert|80|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|300|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, constructed on two rows either in a semi-circular or rectangular plan. They were usually aligned overlooking river banks.
* Burials in underground timber or stone chambers inside round or rectangular [[kurgan]]s. The bodies were accompanied by sacrificed animals (mostly horses and dogs), chariots, cheek pieces, weapons, pottery and jewellery.&lt;ref name="andro"/&gt;

==Iron Age==
[[File:Srubna culture01.jpg|thumb|180px|Srubna culture vessel]]
[[File:Srubna culture05.jpg|thumb|180px|Srubna culture weapons]]
Estonian, Finno-Ugric tribes, [[Samoyedic peoples]]  and other Uralic peoples had by the second millennium BCE accomplished settlement consolidation of the [[Ural Mountains#Middle Ural|Middle Ural]] and [[Ural Mountains#Northern Ural|Northern Ural]] according to the [[Proto-Uralic homeland hypotheses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgr.fi/sust/sust264/sust264_hakkinenj.pdf |title=Early contacts between Uralic and Yukaghir. | publisher=Häkkinen, Jaakko 2012 | date= | accessdate=December 24, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the II millennium BCE Ural has become a source for resources in North Asia. In the Southern Ural the Andronovo culture and [[Srubna culture]] were succeeded by the [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]].

A study on DNA variation among ancient Europeans found that, of the 6 samples extracted from Srubna culture sites for whom a Y-DNA hapogroup could be tested, all belonged to haplogroup [[R1a]], and four of them to subclade R1a-Z93, which is common among modern-day [[Indo-Iranians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite biorxiv|author=Iain Mathieson|title=Eight thousand years of natural selection in Europe|year=2015|biorxiv=016477|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mallory"&gt;[[J.

Authors of [[classical antiquity]] developed the concept of the [[Riphean Mountains]] - an area of which the location is uncertain. the [[Riphean Mountains]] referred to the Ural Mountains.

The Ural was considered the boundary between two worlds: the civilized Europe and distant, mysterious Asia. Where the world's civilizations converge. Fate of nations indelible marked on the precipice of history and culture of Eurasia.

By the early common Era [[Migration Period|great Migrations]]  of nomads from the east - [[Huns]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Slavs]], and [[Bulgars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.umwblogs.org/blogs.dir/8470/files/2013/12/Lit-Review-Final-Draft.pdf|publisher=Shauna Sanford|title=Ethnogenesis Throughout the Twentieth Century|date=|accessdate=December 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; via the Ural steppes ascended into [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Europe]] significantly influencing the indigenous peoples of the southern Ural region  - the [[Bashkirs]] and [[Bulgars]].

==The Middle Ages==
[[File:Herberstein-Moscovia-NE.png|thumb|180px|Ural in the fragment of von Herberstein's map]]
The complex archaeological cultures appeared in the Urals during the Middle Ages, characterized by ethnic descendants as the Sarmatians and Huns. At the same time the ancestors of the Hungarians - ancient Magyars, ([[Kushnarenkovo culture|Kushnarenkovo]] and [[Karayakupovo culture|Karayakupovo]] archaeological cultures), and ancestors of the Bashkirs - ancient Badzhgards ([[Turbasli culture|Turbasli archaeological culture]]) formed in the [[Southern Ural]].&lt;ref&gt;Мажитов Н.А. Турбаслинская культура//Степи Евразии в эпоху средневековья. М., 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Ural was the legendary birthplace of Great Hungary ([[Magna Hungaria]]) and the country of the [[Bashkirs]] - the [[Badzhgard]] ([[Bashkurd]]).
&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://books.google.com.kh/books?id=Zo2UVs_Sr68C&amp;pg=PA324&amp;lpg=PA324&amp;dq=The+Middle+Ages+Ural&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6elu3X8sHm&amp;sig=uYjNfSasDeTsXMxEFD953xIlOc4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqxM6o9ozRAhVEmJQKHYNnCCMQ6AEISTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Middle%20Ages%20Ural&amp;f=false |title=The Visigoths from the Migration Period to the Seventh Century: An Ethnographic Perspective|publisher=Google Books|date= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration period===
The migrations of  [[Warhonits|Avars-Warhonits]], [[Ashina tribe|Turks of Ashina]], the [[Pechenegs]], the [[Oghuz Turks|Guzs]], the [[Magyars|Hungarians-Magyars]], and [[Kipchaks]] [[nomads]] from the Southern Ural region or passing through the [[Southern Ural]] towards the west and Central Europe began during the early Medieval period.
&lt;ref name='Lendvai'&gt;Paul Lendvai, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UtIr97n3tP0C&amp;pg=PA533 The Hungarians: a thousand years of victory in defeat], C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, 2003, p. 15-29, p. 533&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern and Middle Ural maintains a continuous population and economy - Khants, Udmurts, Komi, Nenets, Mansi, Fins, etc. resume their semi-Neolithic lifestyle.

Bashkirs and [[Turkic people]] are the new indigenous people of the Southern Ural region. But the descendants of the Bulgars from Volga and Ural there are mostly modern Volga Tatars, Chuvash and part of Bashkirs. The hordes of [[Mongols]] arrive during the 13th century, followed by the [[Jochi Khan|Jochi Ulus]], the [[Golden Horde]] and the [[Nogai Horde]].

== Colonization period ==
[[File:Ilja Jefimowitsch Repin - Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks - Yorck.jpg|thumb|180px|"Zaporozhian Cossacks write to the Sultan of Turkey" by [[Ilya Repin]]]]
Known to medieval Russians as the Stone Belt, the Urals were reached in the early 12th century by colonists and fur traders from Novgorod. Colonization developed rapidly in the late 16th century. The first iron works were established in the 1630s, and metallurgy was encouraged by Peter the Great. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries the Ural area was a major iron producer, but its relative importance declined in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Geological Society of London (1894). The Quarterly journal of the Geological Society of London. The Society. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cossacks]] settled in the Southern Ural along the river [[Ural river|Yaik]] during the colonial period. The Bashkir wars against the [[Tsarist autocracy|Tsarist autocratic]] regime and the colonizers take place in the Ural. The last major uprising was associated with the name of [[Don Cossack]] - [[Yemelyan Pugachev]] and his companions - [[Salawat Yulayev|Salavat Yulaev]].

==Modern era==

Under the first two Five-Year Plans (1929–39), the tremendous industrial development of the Urals was based on Ural iron ore and coking coal shipped by rail from the Kuznetsk Basin. During World War II, industries were transplanted from European USSR to the Urals, strategically situated in the heart of the USSR. Since the war, coking coal from the Qaraghandy Basin, Kuznetsk coal, and hydroelectric power have supported the metallurgical industry, which has been enormously expanded.&lt;ref&gt;Podvig, Pavel; Bukharin, Oleg; von Hippel, Frank (2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CPRVbYDc-7kC&amp;pg=PA70 Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces]. MIT Press. p. 70. {{ISBN|978-0-262-66181-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Urals industrial area (c.290,000 sq mi/751,100&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), a major Russia metallurgical region, is in the central and S Urals and the adjacent lowlands. Huge industrial centers are found at Yekaterinburg, Magnitogorsk, Chelyabinsk, Perm, Berezniki, Nizhni Tagil, Orsk, Orenburg, Ufa, and Zlatoust.

History decreed that on the threshold of the third millennium, in spite of the significantly depleted natural resources, Ural continues to play an important role in the fate of the Russian Federation. From here we went many democratic initiatives of our time. Ural nominated from among themselves the leaders of the reform and the first President of Russia - [[Boris Yeltsin]].

'''Ibn Thabit''' is an anonymous [[Hip hop music]]ian from [[Libya]] known for his anti-government songs. Thabit has been living in Libya where any form of dissent was banned by law in [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s regime and could have resulted in his being arrested and imprisoned, the primary reason for his using an epithet to preserve his anonymity. Ibn Thabit's music is considered to have given a voice to Libyans who wish to express themselves politically and non-violently despite being disenfranchised.&lt;ref name="Aslanmedia 08082011"/&gt; Dissenting cultural figures have been arrested and tortured in a number of countries during the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref name="FreeMuse 20042011"/&gt;

Ibn Thabit considers himself to be an ordinary Libyan who is "speaking the thoughts of many Libyan youth".&lt;ref name="Aslanmedia 08082011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aslanmedia.com/music/306-music-artist-profile/3065-ibn-thabit-the-beat-behind-libyas-revolution |title=Ibn Thabit: The Beat Behind Libya's Revolution |author=Unattributed |date=8 August 2011 |work= |publisher=Aslan Media |accessdate=13  August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909082334/http://www.aslanmedia.com/music/306-music-artist-profile/3065-ibn-thabit-the-beat-behind-libyas-revolution |archivedate=9 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that he is inspired by the people, telling a journalist from the Danish newspaper ''Information'' that he was more affected by conversations with fellow Libyans than by anything else.&lt;ref name="FreeMuse 20042011"/&gt; Not much is known about him other than that he is young, male and Libyan.&lt;ref name="Aslanmedia 08082011"/&gt; He is thought to be from Tarhunah. Ibn Thabit was one of the early critics of Gaddafi in 2011, the nascent movement building up to a full-fledged civil war, part of the Arab Spring.

{{Quote box|width=|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|title = 'Al-Soo'al' (The Issue)&lt;ref name="FreeMuse 20042011"/&gt;|&lt;poem&gt;
Muammar: You have never served the people
Muammar: You'd better give up
Confess. You cannot escape
Our revenge will catch you
As a train roars through a wall
We will drown you.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Popular music of kind produced by Ibn Thabit represents the cultural face of the [[2011 Libyan civil war]]. One of his works praises the city of [[Benghazi]].&lt;ref name="Studio360 01072011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studio360.org/2011/jul/01/libyas-soundtrack-revolution/|title=Libya's Soundtrack to the Revolution/ |author1=Anderson, Kurt  |author2=John, Derek |date=1 July 2011 |work=Studio360|publisher=Public Radio International |accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheNewSignificance 22062011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsignificance.com/2011/06/22/top-five-arab-spring-hip-hop-songs/|title=Top Five Arab Spring Hip-Hop Songs|author=Nation Public Radio|date=22 Jun 2011|work=The New Significance (webzine)|publisher=|accessdate=13  August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918083916/http://www.thenewsignificance.com/2011/06/22/top-five-arab-spring-hip-hop-songs/|archivedate=18 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Thabit has his own website with support from people abroad on which many of his own songs and others produced in collaboration are freely available for download.&lt;ref name="TheNewSignificance 22062011"/&gt; On his website, Ibn Thabit claims that to have been "attacking Gaddafi" with music since 2008, when he posted his first song, "Moammar - the coward",  on the internet.&lt;ref name="TheNewSignificance 22062011"/&gt;

Lyrics of a song "Al-Soo'al" released by Ibn Thabit on YouTube on 27 January 2011, weeks before the riots began in Libya are indicative of the rebel sentiment.&lt;ref name="FreeMuse 20042011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freemuse.org/sw41490.asp|title=Hip-hop is a soundtrack to the North African revolt |author=Unattributed |date=20 April 2011 |work=Free Muse - Freedom of Musical Expression |publisher=Freemuse, Copenhagen, Denmark|accessdate=13  August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Thabit's music is featured in a compilation of Arabic Spring resistance rap songs by [[Khala (Arab musician)|Khala]] labelled ''Khala's Mixtape Volume 1''.&lt;ref name="FreeMuse 20042011"/&gt;

'''Isi Israel Metzstein''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (7 July 1928 – 10 January 2012) was a German-born architect who worked at [[Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia]] and taught at the [[Glasgow School of Art]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/9116790/Isi-Metzstein.html|title=Isi Metzstein|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became known for his postwar architectural designs working in the European modernist style of [[Le Corbusier]] and the American [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jan/22/isi-metzstein|title=Isi Metzstein obituary|last=Stamp|first=Gavin|date=2012-01-22|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lentrée de la "Glasgow School of Art" (3802873999).jpg|thumb|The Glasgow School of Art where Isi Metzstein taught.|328x328px]]

== Early life ==
Isi Metzstein was born in the Mitte district of Berlin in 1928,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200546|title=Dictionary of Scottish Architects - DSA Architect Biography Report (November 16, 2016, 3:30 pm)|last=Goold|first=David|website=www.scottisharchitects.org.uk|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of five children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His parents, Efraim and Rachel Metzstein, were Polish Jews who had moved to Germany in 1920. Isi had an older sister, Lee, an older brother, Josef, a twin sister, Jenny, and a younger brother, Leo,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1933, Isi's father, Efraim, died leaving his mother to raise the five children on her own.

In November 1938, after [[Kristallnacht]] had seen Isi's school set on fire, his mother saw to it that her children were kept safe by sending the 11-year-old Isi and his siblings to Britain on the [[Kindertransport]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With his brothers and sisters scattered around the UK, Isi was taken in by a family in [[Clydebank|Hardgate, Clydebank]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; before they could all be reunited once more, eventually settling in Glasgow.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Career ==
After leaving [[Hyndland Secondary School|Hyndland School]] in 1945, Isi's professional career as an architect began with taking evening classes in architecture at the Glasgow School of Art&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and an apprenticeship under [[Jack Coia]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; at Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia.  Whilst at the Glasgow School of Art, Isi met Andy MacMillan and the two became friends, often going for drinks together in the Kings Arms on Elmbank Street.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

When [[Andy MacMillan]] joined the firm in 1954, the pair designed many churches, colleges &amp; schools together in the Modernist style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1969, Isi began teaching at the Glasgow School of Art.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and became Professor of Architecture at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1984 before returning to teach in Glasgow in 1991.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Isi married Danielle Kahn in 1967 &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and the pair had three children, Mark, [[Saul Metzstein|Saul]] and Ruth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He died on 10 January 2012&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; at their home in Hillhead, Glasgow.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Writing of Isi Metzstein's passing for Architectural Review, Clare Wright noted that:&lt;blockquote&gt;"With a change of ethos post war, Coia ceded much of the design control to the young Isi and Andy. An early project for St Paul’s Church in Glenrothes (1957) is a modest building of simple form and materials, yet exhibits an extraordinary quality of light and monumental presence which owed much to Le Corbusier. The sixteen churches that followed formed a distinctive body of work. Combining functional requirements with resonant symbolism, they were the perfect vehicle for developing an architectural philosophy, which reached its most mature expression in the design for St Peter’s Seminary at Cardross."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1792">John Kendrew (1748-1800), a Darlington Quaker, is best known for having invented the first effective process for the mechanical spinning of flax. With Thomas Porthouse, a local clockmaker, he built a working machine and together in 1787 they patented the design in both England and Scotland.  They licensed  the technology to others, and subsequently each built their own mill - Kendrew's being near Haughton le Skerne on the NE outskirts of Darlington. After Kendrew's death, Porthouse took out his own patent, as did others and most flax mills were technological descendants of the Kendrew/Porthouse design.&lt;ref&gt;O. Gregory, ''A Treatise of Machanics'', vol 2, (London 1806), 511; J.Nicholson, ''The Operative mechanic'', (London 1825), 405; A. J. Warden, ''The linen trade: ancient and modern'' (1864; repr. 1967), 690-92;  B.Barber, 'John Kendrew &amp; Company, Flax Spinners, 1787-1794', ''Cleveland History'' no. 32 (1976/77), 1-3. &lt;/ref&gt;   

By 1776, Kendrew, a self-taught mechanic, had erected a water driven mill on the river Skerne, at Low Mill, just south of Darlington Bridge, for the purpose of grinding  spectacle lenses in large numbers.After that date he was frequently described as an 'optician'. This mill continued in operating after his death, and achieved contemporary fame, though claims that it was the first of its kind in the country cannot be upheld. &lt;ref&gt; D.J.Bryden, 'The Ribrights, Opticians in the Poultry, London: and the use of powered machinery for working lenses and mirros at Tewin (Herts), Bromley (Kent) and Darlington (Co.

'''Leland Jensen''' (22 August 1914 &amp;ndash; 6 August 1996) was the founder of a [[Bahá'í divisions|Bahá'í sect]] called the [[Bahá'ís Under the Provisions of the Covenant]] (BUPC). Jensen initially supported the claim of [[Mason Remey]] to be the successor to [[Shoghi Effendi]] in 1960, resulting in his excommunication from the mainstream [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] community.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=271}} Jensen went on to propagate his own teachings among a group of followers that observers say probably never exceeded 200,{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=271}} but declined in size significantly from 1990-1996.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=280}} During his lifetime adherents were mostly concentrated in [[Montana]], with smaller groups in other US states.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=271}}{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=280}}

Jensen gained national attention when on April 26, 1980 he led a group of followers into fallout shelters, expecting an apocalyptic nuclear holocaust.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=269}} He went on to predict that [[Halley's Comet]] would enter earth's orbit on April 29, 1986, and collide with the earth exactly one year later.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=277}} With Jensen's approval, in the early 1990s his companion Neal Chase made a total of 18 disconfirmed prophecies that pertained to small-scale disasters that he claimed would lead step-by-step towards the [[Apocalypse]], as well as dates for a nuclear attack on [[New York City]] by middle Eastern terrorists.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=272}}

==Background==
Jensen was a third generation [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] on his mother's side. He and his wife, Opal, received doctorates in natural medicine, becoming chiropractic doctors. They attended the School of Drugless Physicians and graduated in 1944. Opal was the valedictorian and Jensen graduated with distinction (cum laude).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bupc.org/establisher-fireside.pdf Proof for the Establisher Fireside pg 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

After they graduated, and after practicing for a while, they moved to [[St. Louis]]. In 1953 [[Shoghi Effendi]] launched the [[Ten Year Crusade]], which aimed at bringing the message of Bahá'u'lláh to the entire world. Jensen and his wife gave up their practice and went to two tiny islands in the Indian Ocean off the coast of [[Madagascar]]. The first island was the French island of [[Réunion]], which practiced Catholicism as the State Religion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} He then stayed six months in [[Mauritius]]. Jensen and his wife were the first Bahá'ís to visit these islands, and therefore received the title of [[Knights of Bahá'u'lláh]]. More than 200 Bahá'ís received the title after moving to areas designated by Shoghi Effendi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/roll_honor_knights_bahaullah Roll of Honor Bahá'í World Crusade 1953-1963], Leland and Opal can be found in the second row, fourth column.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Opal died in 1990.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=280}}

===Mason Remey===
{{main|Mason Remey}}
When Shoghi Effendi died in 1957 there were no eligible appointees who met the required conditions for successorship, and he died without having appointed a successor. [[Mason Remey]] was among the nine [[Hands of the Cause]] elected as an interim authority until the election of the first [[Universal House of Justice]] in 1963.{{sfn|Rabbani|1992|pp=28–30}} However, in 1960 Remey declared himself to be the successor of Shoghi Effendi, and expected the allegiance of the world's Bahá'ís. Subsequently, he and his followers were unanimously declared [[Covenant-breaker|Covenant breakers]] by the [[Hand of the Cause|Hands]].{{sfn|Smith|1999|p=292}} They reasoned that he lacked a formal appointment from Shoghi Effendi, and that the office was scripturally restricted to male descendants of [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. Almost the whole Bahá'í world rejected his claim,{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=69}} but he gained the support of a small but widespread group of Bahá'ís.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=69}} Jensen was among these first supporters of Remey. In 1964 he moved to [[Missoula, Montana]] with his wife where they opened a chiropractic clinic.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=271}}

===Prison===
In 1969 Jensen was convicted of "a lewd and lascivious act" for sexually molesting a 15-year-old female patient,{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=271}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/cases/montana/supreme-court/1969/11610-0.html ''State v. Jensen'', 153 Mont. 233, 455 P.2d 631 (Montana, 1969)]&lt;/ref&gt; and served four years of a twenty-year sentence in the [[Montana State Prison]]. He claimed to be wrongly convicted, and later taught his followers that his prison stay was instrumental towards fulfilling prophecy.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=272}} It was in prison that Jensen claimed to have a revelation, and converted several dozen inmates to his idea of being the "Establisher" of the Bahá'í Faith,{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=271}} stemming from his belief that the majority of Bahá'ís had followed the wrong leadership and that he was chosen to re-establish a divinely sanctioned order.{{sfn|Hyslop|2004}}

He recruited many followers in prison, and after his parole in 1973 he founded the BUPC. By 1979, his apocalyptic prophecy was receiving national press coverage and he had attracted followers in Wyoming, Colorado, and Arkansas.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=271}}

==Disconfirmed prophecies==

Between 1979 and 1995 Jensen, and his companion Neal Chase, made twenty specific predictions centering nuclear attacks, worldwide catastrophes, and some smaller scale disasters. Jensen himself set two of the dates, while Chase set the other 18.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=272}} Between 1980 and 1996, four researchers took part in group activities and even stayed the night in three BUPC fallout shelters in 1980.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=270}}

===Nuclear holocaust===

In 1979, approximately 6 years after being released from prison, Jensen began teaching his followers that on April 29, 1980 a nuclear holocaust would kill a third of the world's population, and that over the next twenty years, the planet would be ravaged until in the year 2000 "God's Kingdom" would be established and a thousand years of peace would follow.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=269}} On the fateful night, Jensen led a group of followers into fallout shelters in Missoula, Montana.{{sfn|Shermer|1999}}

The disconfirmed prophecy resulted in Jensen losing several contingents of adherents,{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=271}} and his response was that he was right all along. Over the following years Jensen used several types of explanations, as noted by researcher Robert Balch,{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=273}}
#The prediction was fulfilled spiritually rather than physically.
#The prophecy was fulfilled physically, but not in the manner expected.
#The date was off because of a miscalculation.
#The date was a prediction, not a prophecy.
#The leaders had a moral responsibility to warn the public despite the date's uncertainty.
#God had given the world a reprieve.
#The prediction had been a test of members' faith.

Jensen's followers had made substantial commitments to the prediction, building shelters, writing letters to government agencies and newspapers, and distributed thousands of leaflets urging fellow Missoulians to build fall-out shelters. To them the disconfirmation was "painfully obvious",{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=277}} and researchers used them as a case study in [[cognitive dissonance]].

On the day after Jensen's failed prophecy, the local newspaper of Missoula, Montana, the ''[[Missoulian]]'', published the following on April 30, 1980:

:"Based on his interpretations of the Bible and on measurements of the Great Pyramid of Kuhfu in Giza, Egypt, Jensen said, ‘either a provocative act that will escalate into World War III, or World War III itself,’ was to occur at 5:55 p.m. MDT Tuesday [4/29/80]." (''Missoulian'', Vol. 107 No. 311 April 30, 1980)

When asked by a UPI reporter Jensen did not express concern that the prediction might not come true, remarking "There will be a nuclear holocaust some day."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Florida Times-Union | date =1980-04-29 | title = Doomsday is upon us, group claims }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halley's Comet===
After the 1980 event, Jensen introduced the idea that the seven-year [[Tribulation]] had begun on the date of his prediction of a nuclear holocaust, and thus committed himself to another event happening on the same date in 1987.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=277}} In 1985 he made the prediction that [[Halley's Comet]] would enter Earth's orbit on April 29, 1986, and collide with the Earth exactly one year later. In the interim year, he taught that the comet would break apart, pelt the Earth with debris, and produce massive earthquakes.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=277}} The new prophecy rekindled his followers, who became excited with the new idea.

As opposed to the first prediction, this time his followers made very little commitments to the prophecy, and began making disclaimers even before the 1986 event. When the members gathered on the night before the comet was supposed to enter Earth's orbit, nobody mentioned the comet.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=278}} Jensen later said that the massive earthquakes were fulfilled by a "spiritual earthquake" when one of his important followers defected and left him.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=273}}

===Neal Chase===

By the 1990s one of Jensen's students had become a protoge and began making his own prophecies with Jensen's approval. Throughout the 1990s Neal Chase made a total of 18 predictions which pertained to small-scale disasters that he claimed would lead step-by-step towards apocalypse, as well as dates for a nuclear attack on New York City by middle Eastern terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;Balch states: "All eighteen predications in the 1990s were made by Chase…. Chase’s predictions pertained to small-scale disasters that he claimed would lead step-by step toward the apocalypse. Some of his predictions focused on upheavals caused by meteors, asteroids and comets, but most pertained to the destruction of New York City by a nuclear bomb that would be placed by Middle Eastern terrorists." (Balch et al., cf. {{sfn|Stone|2000|p=272}})&lt;/ref&gt; He based these predictions on Biblical prophecies, evidence from Hopi prophecies, planetary conjunctions, dreams, numerological coincidences, [[Nostradamus]], and psychics.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=278}} After each failed prediction, the BUPC adherents carried on as usual, giving disclaimers to future predictions, and focusing on Jensen's other teachings.

==Death and legacy==

Jensen taught that the leadership of the mainstream [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] community had gone astray, and that [[Mason Remey]] was the next rightful heir to leadership after [[Shoghi Effendi]]. Jensen considered himself restoring the rightful leadership, which he believed had been passed to Remey's adopted son Pepe Remey. Pepe denied this claim and refused association with Jensen's group, thus leaving Jensen's followers with no clear scripturally sanctioned leadership.

Jensen's followers consisted of roughly 150 people leading up to 1980,{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=132}} but declined in size significantly following the disconfirmed prophecy, with almost all of the believers outside of Montana eventually rejecting Jensen's teachings.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=138}} In 1994 a membership phone list showed 66 members in Missoula, Montana, and less than 20 in other states.{{sfn|Stone|2000|p=271}}

As Jensen's own chosen successor, Pepe Remey, refused to participate in his new sect and died in 1994. Jensen approached old age with disconfirmed prophecies, declining membership, and no Guardian to speak of when he died in 1996. A schism over leadership of the group in 2001 resulted in other defections and an unresolved [[Bahá'ís Under the Provisions of the Covenant#Leadership dispute|court battle]] for control of funds.

==Works==
Having worked in a print shop while in college, Jensen became a [[Self-publishing|self-publisher]].  The Bahá'í Publishers Under the Provisions of the Covenant published several of his and other books.  A few of his more notable books are:  
*[http://www.bupc.org/Most-Mighty-Document.pdf The Most Mighty Document] (1979) - The 7th Letter to Pepe Remey explaining their roles, the Covenant, and Jensen's beliefs on the succession of the Guardianship.

This is a partial list of confirmed '''famous people who were or are [[gay]], [[lesbian]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]]'''. Famous people who are simply rumored to be gay, lesbian or bisexual, are not listed.

The historical concept, [[definition]] and [[terminology]] of [[sexual orientation]] varies and has changed greatly over time; for example the word "gay" wasn't used to describe sexual orientation until the mid 20th century. A number of different classification schemes have been used to describe sexual orientation since the mid-19th century, and scholars have often defined the term "sexual orientation" in divergent ways. Indeed, several studies have found that much of the research about sexual orientation has failed to define the term at all, making it difficult to reconcile the results of different studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gerdes |first=L.C. |title=The Developing Adult | edition=Second |location=Durban: Butterworths; Austin, Texas |publisher=Butterworth Legal Publishers |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-409-10188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sell |first=Randall L. |date=December 1997 |title=Defining and Measuring Sexual Orientation: A Review: How do you define sexual orientation? |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume= 26 |issue= 6 |pages=643–658 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/context/defining.html |accessdate=11 July 2007 |doi=10.1023/A:1024528427013 |pmid=9415799}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most definitions include a psychological component (such as the direction of an individual's erotic desire) and/or a behavioural component (which focuses on the sex of the individual's sexual partner/s). Some prefer to simply follow an individual's self-definition or [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. See [[homosexuality]] and [[bisexuality]] for criteria that have traditionally denoted lesbian, gay and bisexual ([[LGBT|LGB]]) people.

The high prevalence of people from the West on this list may be due to [[societal attitudes towards homosexuality]]. The [[Pew Research Center]]'s 2003 Global Attitudes Survey found that "[p]eople in Africa and the Middle East strongly object to societal acceptance of homosexuality. But there is far greater tolerance for homosexuality in major Latin American countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil. Opinion in Europe is split between West and East. Majorities in every Western European nation surveyed say homosexuality should be accepted by society, while most Russians, Poles and Ukrainians disagree. Americans are divided – a thin majority (51&amp;nbsp;percent) believes homosexuality should be accepted, while 42&amp;nbsp;percent disagree."&lt;ref name="pewreport"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pew Global Attitudes Project |title=Views of a Changing World |url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=185 |format=PDF |date=June 2003 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Pew Research Center for the People &amp; The Press | oclc=52547041 |accessdate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The response from our readers on that was overwhelmingly positive. The difference for us is that Miss Racette was on our cover because of her accomplishments as a singer. Her relationship with her partner was and is a very important part of who she is an artist, so with her permission and encouragement, we included a discussion of that part of her life. We did not put her on the cover of the magazine because she was a lesbian.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lars (Lasse) Johansson''' (1638 &amp;ndash; August 13, 1674), usually referred to under his pseudonym '''Lucidor''', was a Swedish baroque poet. He is remembered for his burlesque poetry that is seen as foreshadowing that of [[Johan Runius]] and, especially, [[Carl Michael Bellman]], and for his dramatic death in a tumultuous brawl at the Fimmelstången tavern in Gamla stan in Stockholm. Lasse Johansson wrote under several different pseudonyms, but of these "Lucidor" (or "Lucidor den olycklige", "Lucidor the Unfortunate", as he called himself on occasion) is the one under which he is commonly known today.&lt;ref&gt;The hybrid form "Lasse Lucidor", which is sometimes seen, as in [[Nils Ferlin]]'s poem "På källaren Fimmelstången", seems not to be attested from his own time.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lars Johansson was born in [[Stockholm]]. His father was a naval officer and his grandfather was admiral [[Lars Strusshielm]], who was appointed head of a Swedish naval shipyard in [[Pomerania]] in 1638. A few years later, Strusshielm's daughter and son-in-law followed him to Pomerania, where Lars Johansson and his four siblings grew up. Both parents were dead by 1650, and the grandfather died in 1653. Lasse spent four years, from 1655 to 1659 at the university of [[Greifswald]] and from early 1659 at the university in [[Leipzig]], where he was expelled just before Christmas 1659, after a brawl with the town guards. His biography during the following years is unclear, but he travelled to [[France]], possibly as a tutor, and is said to have lived in poverty in Stockholm. He may have spent time with a travelling group of comedians, and is reported to have returned to Stockholm with these in 1668. During the winter 1668/69, he was enrolled as a student in [[Uppsala]], but appeared to have spent his time there as a language tutor for students; an appointment as a teacher of modern languages fell through.

A significant part of his modest income appears to have come from writing [[occasional poetry]] for weddings and burials. One piece brought him in trouble: "Giliare Kwaal" ("A suitor's sufferings"), a poem for the wedding in November 1669 of the powerful nobleman [[Conrad Gyllenstierna]] to Märta Christina Ulfsparre. Lucidor had previously written a well-received poem for the wedding of Conrad's brother Christoffer Gyllenstierna. "Giliare Kwaal", however, was received as libel by Conrad Gyllenstierna, who reported the author to Svea hovrätt, the appeal court. The poet was arrested and spent several months in prison until the process was finally at an end in the summer of 1670. Neither the town court in Stockholm nor the appeal court found the poem libellous, but the sentence still warned the poet to "use his pencil more carefully hereafter". The Lucidor scholar Stina Hansson explains the problems with the poem in that the author did not follow the conventions for which motifs were conventional for addressee of a particular social standing, and had broken the rules by using a style more suitable for occasional poetry in a bourgeois setting. After his run-in with the Gyllenstierna, Lucidor became much more careful in exactly following the conventions in this respect.

Lucidor's best remembered poem, the ballad "Skulle Jag sörja då wore Jag tokot" ("If I would mourn, I would be crazy") is traditionally said to have been written during his time in prison.

Lucidor was killed in a bar brawl-turned-duel with a Lieutenant Arvid Christian Storm.

Three of Lucidor's religious songs were published in 1685 under the name "Lucida intervalla", edited by [[Haquin Spegel]]. These remained part of the hymn book of the Church of Sweden into the 20th century. In 1689, Johan Andersin, an accountant who had been a friend of Lucidor, published a collection of his poetry with the title "Helicons blomster/ plåckade ok wid åtskillige tillfällen utdelte af Lucidor den olycklige", subtitled "det är alle de poëtiske skriffter som författade blefne af Lasse Johanson".

"Helicons blomster" was republished in 1835, and a new collection including some additional poems was published in 1865. Modern editions have been published by Fredrik sandwall in  1914-30 and by Stina Hansson in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Hansson's edition is available in a digital version online ({{cite web |url=http://spraakbanken.gu.se/vittsam/PDF/SVS_blue/lucidor_dikter.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928150303/http://spraakbanken.gu.se/vittsam/PDF/SVS_blue/lucidor_dikter.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-28 |df= }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucidor was not highly appreciated in the 18th century, but Carl Michael Bellman is known to have been familiar with Lucidor and refers to him and Runius together in one of his "Epistles of Fredman" (No 24):

:Jag skull' supa om ni tror,
:Liksom Runius, Lucidor.

:("I will certainly drink,
:like Runius, Lucidor")

The interest in Lucidor was re-awakened in the romantic period. The main authors influencing the image of Lucidor were [[Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom]], [[Oscar Levertin]] and (in the early 20th century) [[Erik Axel Karlfeldt]].

In the late 20th century, Lucidor has been the topic of a novel by [[Torbjörn Säfve]].

The musicologist and musician [[Martin Bagge]] (who is also known as an interpreter of the works of Bellman) has published a collection of Lucidor's poems with musical annotation, and a CD recording them. It has been known that many of Lucidor's poems were written to be sung but no melodies have been preserved. Assuming that Lucidor borrowed melodies popular in his time (as many other poets of the time, and later Bellman, did), Bagge has attempted to reconstruct the music by matching the metrics with hymns and other songs with which the poet would have been familiar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&amp;a=247542, "Lasse Lucidors okända visor återskapas"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{masculism sidebar}}
A  '''man''' is a [[male]] human.&lt;!--The word adult is not needed in this sentence; see the following sentence.--&gt; The term ''man'' is usually reserved for an [[adult]] male, with the term ''boy'' being the usual term for a male child or adolescent. However, the term ''man'' is also sometimes used to identify a male human, regardless of age, as in phrases such as "[[men's basketball]]".

Like most other male [[mammal]]s, a man's [[genome]] typically inherits an [[X chromosome|X&amp;nbsp;chromosome]] from his mother and  a [[Y chromosome|Y&amp;nbsp;chromosome]] from his father. The male [[fetus]] produces larger amounts of [[androgen]]s and smaller amounts of [[estrogen]]s than a female fetus. This difference in the relative amounts of these [[sex steroid]]s is largely responsible for the [[physiology|physiological]] differences that distinguish men from women. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes. However, there are exceptions to the above for some [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] men.

==Etymology==
{{Main|Man (word)}}
The English term "man" is derived from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*man-'' (see [[Sanskrit]]/[[Avestan]] ''manu-'', [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''mǫž'' "man, male").&lt;ref&gt;''American Heritage Dictionary'', Appendix I: Indo-European Roots. [http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE295.html man-1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519035935/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE295.html |date=19 May 2006 }}. Accessed 2007-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt; More directly, the word derives from [[Old English]] ''mann.'' The Old English form had a default meaning of "adult male" (which was the exclusive meaning of ''wer''), though it could also signify a person of unspecified gender. The closely related Old English pronoun ''man'' was used just as it is in Modern German to designate  "one" (e.&amp;nbsp;g., in the saying ''man muss mit den Wölfen heulen'').&lt;ref&gt;[[John Richard Clark Hall]]: A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;
The Old English form is derived from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*[[mannaz|mannz]]'', "human being, person", which is also the [[etymon]] of German ''Mann'' "man, husband" and ''man'' "one" (pronoun), [[Old Norse]] ''maðr'', and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''manna''. According to [[Tacitus]], the mythological progenitor of the Germanic tribes was called ''[[Mannus]]''. ''*Manus'' in [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European mythology]] was the first man, see [[Mannus]], [[Manu (Hinduism)]].

==Age and terminology==
{{Main|Virility}}
The term '''''manhood''''' is used to describe the period in a human male's life after he has transitioned from [[boyhood]], having passed through [[puberty]], usually having attained male [[secondary sexual characteristics]], and symbolises a male's [[coming of age]]. The word ''man'' is used to mean any adult male. In English-speaking countries, many other words can also be used to mean an adult male such as ''guy'', ''[[dude]]'', ''[[Friend|buddy]]'', ''bloke'', ''fellow'', ''chap'' and sometimes ''boy'' or ''lad''. The term ''manhood'' is associated with [[masculinity]] and [[virility]], which refer to male qualities and male [[gender roles]].

== Biology and sex == &lt;!-- Please don't rename to "...sex" as there is a link from "woman" here. Biology and sex is redundant here, whereas this section does discuss gender in paragraph 5 --&gt;
{{Main|Secondary sexual characteristics|Sex differences in humans}}
{{see also|Trans man|Intersexuality}}

Humans exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]] in many characteristics, many of which have no direct link to reproductive ability, although most of these characteristics do have a role in sexual attraction. Most expressions of sexual dimorphism in humans are found in height, weight, and body structure, though there are always examples that do not follow the overall pattern. For example, men tend to be taller than women, but there are many people of both sexes who are in the mid-height range for the species.

Some examples of male [[Secondary sex characteristic|secondary sexual characteristics]] in humans, those acquired as boys become men or even later in life, are:
* more [[pubic hair]]
* more [[facial hair]]
* larger hands and feet
* broader [[shoulder]]s and chest
* larger [[Human skull|skull]] and [[bone]] structure
* larger [[Brain size|brain mass and volume]]
* greater [[muscle]] mass
* a more prominent [[Adam's apple]] and deeper voice
* greater [[Human height|height]]
* a higher [[tibia]]:[[femur]] ratio (a longer shinbone in comparison to the thighbone)

===Sexual characteristics===
In mankind, the sex of an individual is generally determined at the time of [[fertilization]] by the genetic material carried in the [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] cell. If a sperm cell carrying an [[X chromosome]] fertilizes the [[ovum|egg]], the offspring will typically be female (XX); if a sperm cell carrying a [[Y chromosome]] fertilizes the egg, the offspring will typically be male (XY). Persons whose anatomy or chromosomal makeup differ from this pattern are referred to as [[intersex]].

This is referred to as the [[XY sex-determination system]] and is typical of most mammals, but quite a few other [[sex-determination system]]s exist, including some that are non-genetic.

The term ''primary sexual characteristics'' denotes the kind of [[gamete]] the [[gonad]] produces: the [[ovary]] produces egg cells in the female, and the [[testis]] produces sperm cells in the male. The term ''secondary sexual characteristics'' denotes all other sexual distinctions that play indirect roles in uniting sperm and eggs. Secondary sexual characteristics include everything from the specialized male and female features of the genital tract, to the brilliant plumage of male birds or facial hair of humans, to behavioral features such as courtship.

===Gender===
Biological factors are not sufficient determinants of whether a person considers themselves a man or is considered a man. [[Intersex]] individuals, who have physical or genetic features considered to be mixed or atypical for one sex or the other, may use other criteria in making a clear determination. There are also [[transgender]] and [[transsexual]] men, who were assigned as female at birth, but identify as men; there are varying social, legal and individual definitions with regard to these issues. (See [[trans man]].)

===Reproductive system===
{{main|Male reproductive system (human)}}
[[File:Male pelvic structures.svg|thumb|right|200px|Human male reproductive anatomy and surroundings]]
The male [[sex organ]]s are part of the reproductive system, consisting of the [[human penis|penis]], [[testicles]], [[vas deferens]], and the [[prostate]] gland. The male reproductive system's function is to produce [[semen]] which carries [[spermatozoon|sperm]] and thus [[DNA|genetic information]] that can unite with an egg within a woman. Since sperm that enters a woman's [[uterus]] and then [[fallopian tubes]] goes on to [[Fertilization|fertilize]] an egg which develops into a [[fetus]] or child, the male reproductive system plays no necessary role during the [[gestation]]. The concept of fatherhood and family exists in human societies. The study of male reproduction and associated organs is called [[andrology]].

[[File:NHGRI human male karyotype.png|thumbnail|left|[[Karyogram]] of human male using [[Giemsa]] staining. Human males typically possess an [[Sex determination and differentiation (human)|XY combination]].]]

===Sex hormones===

In mammals, the [[hormones]] that influence sexual differentiation and development are [[androgens]] (mainly [[testosterone]]), which stimulate later development of the ovary. In the sexually undifferentiated [[embryo]], testosterone stimulates the development of the [[Wolffian duct]]s, the penis, and closure of the [[labioscrotal folds]] into the scrotum.  Another significant hormone in sexual differentiation is the [[anti-Müllerian hormone]], which inhibits development of the [[Müllerian duct]]s.{{clear}}

===Illnesses===
In general, men suffer from many of the same illnesses as women. In comparison to women, men suffer from slightly more illnesses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Male life expectancy is slightly lower than female life expectancy, although the difference has narrowed in recent years.

For males during puberty, testosterone, along with [[gonadotropin]]s released by the [[pituitary gland]], stimulates [[spermatogenesis]], along with the full sexual distinction of a human male from a human female, while women are acted upon by [[estrogen]]s and [[progesterone]] to produce their sexual differences from the human male.

==Masculinity==
{{Main|Masculinity}}
{{See also|Stereotype}}
[[File:David von Michelangelo.jpg|thumb|220px|''[[Michelangelo]]'s [[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' is the [[Renaissance art|classical]] image of youthful male beauty in [[Western art]].]]
[[File:Model-sixpack.jpg|thumb|240px|A German male model showing a muscular body with sixpack, example of masculinity]]

Masculinity has its roots in [[genetics]] (see [[Biology of gender|gender]]).&lt;ref&gt;John Money, 'The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years', Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy 20 (1994): 163-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Laura Stanton and Brenna Maloney, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2006/12/18/GR2006121800372.html 'The Perception of Pain',] ''Washington Post'', 19 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, while masculinity looks different in different cultures, there are common aspects to its definition across cultures. In the past, and still among traditional and non-Western cultures, the most common and definitive sign of becoming a man is getting [[married]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnett|first=Jeffrey Jensen|date=1998|title=Learning to Stand Alone: The Contemporary American Transition to Adulthood in Cultural and Historical Context|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/22591|journal=Human Development|language=english|volume=41|issue=5-6|pages=295–315|doi=10.1159/000022591|issn=0018-716X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern American manhood is less tied to marriage itself, but some qualities traditionally associated with it, such as the "triple Ps" of ''protecting, providing, and [[procreating]],'' are still considered signs of having achieved manhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-DG9L6KQShMC|title=Manhood in the Making: Cultural Concepts of Masculinity|last=Gilmore|first=David D.|date=1990|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=0300050763|location=|pages=48|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sometimes gender scholars will use the phrase "[[hegemony|hegemonic]] masculinity" to distinguish the most dominant form of masculinity from other variants. In the mid-twentieth century United States, for example, [[John Wayne]] might embody one form of masculinity, while [[Albert Einstein]] might be seen as masculine, but not in the same "hegemonic" fashion.  

Anthropology has shown that masculinity itself has [[social status]], just like wealth, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and social class.  In [[western culture]], for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status. Many English words such as ''virtue'' and ''virile'' (from the [[Indo-European root]] ''vir'' meaning ''man'') reflect this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Virtue (2009) |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |month= |year=2009 |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/virtue |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Virile (2009) |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |month= |year=2009 |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/virile |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; An association with physical or moral strength is implied. Masculinity is associated more commonly with adult men than with boys.

A great deal is now known about the development of biological masculine characteristics, such as the hormonal changes that make it possible for men to grow a [[beard]]. The process of [[sexual differentiation]] specific to the reproductive system of ''Homo sapiens'' produces a female by default. The [[SRY gene]] on the [[Y chromosome]], however, interferes with the default process, causing a chain of events that, all things being equal, leads to [[testes]] formation, [[androgen]] production, and a range of both pre-natal and post-natal hormonal effects covered by the terms ''masculinization'' or ''[[virilization]]''. Because masculinization redirects biological processes from the default female route, it is more precisely called ''[[defeminization]]''.

There is an extensive debate about how children develop [[Gender identity|gender identities]].

In many cultures displaying characteristics not typical to one's gender may become a social problem for the individual. Among men, the exhibition of feminine behavior may be considered a sign of homosexuality, while the same is for a woman who exhibits masculine behavior. Within sociology such labeling and conditioning is known as [[gender role|gender assumptions]] and is a part of [[socialization]] to better match a culture's [[mores]]. The corresponding social condemnation of excessive masculinity may be expressed in terms such as "[[machismo]]" or "[[testosterone poisoning]]."

The relative importance of the roles of socialization and genetics in the development of masculinity continues to be debated. While [[social conditioning]] obviously plays a role, it can also be observed that certain aspects of the masculine identity exist in almost all human cultures.

The historical development of gender role is addressed by such fields as [[behavioral genetics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[human ecology]] and [[sociobiology]]. All human cultures seem to encourage the development of gender roles, through literature, [[costume]] and song. Some examples of this might include the epics of [[Homer]], the [[King Arthur]] tales in English, the [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] commentaries of [[Confucius]] or biographical studies of [[Muhammad]]. More specialized treatments of masculinity may be found in works such as the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' or [[bushido]]'s ''[[Hagakure]]''.

[[File:Pope Benedictus XVI january,20 2006 (2) mod.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Benedict XVI|Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI]] was the leader of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], a position that is reserved for men only.]]

Well into prehistoric culture, men are believed to have assumed a variety of social and cultural roles which are likely similar across many groups of humans. In hunter-gatherer societies, men were often if not exclusively responsible for all large game killed, the capture and raising of most or all domesticated animals, the building of permanent shelters, the defense of villages, and other tasks where the male physique and strong spatial-cognition were most useful.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Some anthropologists believe that it may have been men who led the Neolithic Revolution and became the first pre-historical ranchers, as a possible result of their intimate knowledge of animal life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Throughout history, the roles of men have changed greatly. As societies have moved away from agriculture as a primary source of jobs, the emphasis on male physical ability has waned. Traditional gender roles for working men typically involved jobs emphasizing moderate to hard manual labor (see [[Blue-collar worker]]), often with no hope for increase in wage or position. For poorer men among the working classes, the need to support their families, especially during periods of industrial change and economic decline, forced them to stay in dangerous jobs working long arduous hours, often without retirement. Many industrialized countries have seen a shift to jobs which are less physically demanding, with a general reduction in the percentage of manual labor needed in the work force (see [[White-collar worker]]). The male goal in these circumstances is often of pursuing a quality education and securing a dependable, often office-environment, source of income.

The [[Men's Movement]] is in part a struggle for the recognition of equality of opportunity with women, and for equal rights irrespective of gender, even if special relations and conditions are willingly incurred under the form of partnership involved in marriage. The difficulties of obtaining this recognition are due to the habits and customs recent history has produced. Through a combination of economic changes and the efforts of the feminist movement in recent decades, men in some societies now compete with women for jobs that  traditionally excluded women.  Some larger corporations have instituted tracking systems to try to ensure that jobs are filled based on merit and not just on traditional gender selection.  Assumptions and expectations based on sex roles both benefit and harm men in Western society (as they do women, but in different ways) in the workplace as well as on the topics of education, violence, health care, politics, and fatherhood – to name a few. Research has identified anti-male sexism in some areas which can result in what appear to be unfair advantages given to women.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The [[Gender role#Talcott Parsons' view|Parsons model]] was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles. Model A describes total separation of male and female roles, while Model B describes the complete dissolution of barriers between gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhaus: Enzyklopädie der Psychologie, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The examples are based on the context of the culture and infrastructure of the United States. However, these extreme positions are rarely found in reality; actual behavior of individuals is usually somewhere between these poles. The most common 'model' followed in real life in the United States and Great Britain is the 'model of double burden'.{{Clarify|date=August 2011}}

=== Exclusively male roles ===

Some positions and titles are reserved for men only. For example, the position of Pope and Bishop in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Also the [[priesthood]] is exclusively male in the Catholic Church and also some other religious traditions. Men are often given priority for the position of monarch (King in the case of a man) of a country, as it usually passes to the eldest male child upon [[Order of succession|succession]].

[[Image:Arrest Memmorable title page.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Title page of ''Arrest Memorable'', an account of the case written by trial judge [[Jean de Coras]] in 1560 and published in 1565]]

'''Martin Guerre''', a [[France|French]] peasant of the {{date|16th century|link}}, was at the center of a famous case of [[impostor|imposture]]. Several years after Martin Guerre had left his wife, child, and village, a man claiming to be him reappeared.  He lived with Guerre's wife and son for three years. 

The false Martin Guerre was eventually suspected of the impersonation. He was tried, discovered to be a man named '''Arnaud du Tilh''', and executed. The real Martin Guerre had returned during the trial. The case continues to be studied and dramatized to this day.

==Historical account==

=== Life before leaving his wife ===
Martin Daguerre was born around 1524 in the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque]] town of [[Hendaye]]. In 1527, his family moved to the village of [[Artigat]] in the [[Pyrenees]] of southwestern [[France]].  They changed their name to Guerre. When he was about fourteen years old, Martin married Bertrande de Rols, the daughter of a well-off family.  The marriage was childless for eight years until a son was born.&lt;ref name="Davis-1983"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Natalie Zemon|title=The Return of Martin Guerre|date=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-674-76691-1|edition=Paperback|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5f46_hWsJAkC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accused of stealing grain from his father, Martin abruptly disappeared in 1548.
[[Roman Catholic]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] did not allow his abandoned wife to remarry. (The Protestant [[Huguenots]] who were [[French Wars of Religion|then winning converts in France]] would have allowed such a remarriage.)

=== "New Martin" appears ===
On the summer of 1556,&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Edward Morphet, The Return of Martin Guerre (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; a man arrived in Artigat who claimed to be the long-gone Martin Guerre. By his similar looks and detailed knowledge of Guerre's life, he convinced most of the villagers. Martin Guerre's uncle and four sisters, as well as his wife Bertrande, believed the man was Guerre, as he claimed, although doubts remained.

The "new" Martin Guerre lived for three years with Bertrande and her son; they had two children together, with one daughter surviving. "Martin" claimed the inheritance of Guerre's father, who had died. He sued Guerre's paternal uncle Pierre Guerre for part of the inheritance.

Pierre Guerre, who had married Bertrande's widowed mother during Martin Guerre's long absence, became suspicious. He and his wife tried to convince Bertrande that the new Martin was an impostor. A soldier who passed through Artigat claimed the man was a fraud: he said the true Martin had lost a leg in the war. Pierre and his sons-in-law attacked the new Martin with a club, but Bertrande intervened.

In 1559, villagers accused the new Martin of [[arson]] and of impersonating the real Martin Guerre. With Bertrande remaining on his side, he was acquitted in 1560.

=== Trial in Rieux ===
In the meantime, Pierre Guerre had been asking around and believed he had uncovered the identity of the impostor: Arnaud du Tilh, nicknamed "Pansette"'','' a man with a poor reputation from the nearby village of Tilh, in the region of [[Sajas]]. Pierre initiated a new case against the man by falsely claiming to act in Bertrande's name (only the wronged wife could bring the suit). He and his wife, Bertrande's mother, pressured Bertrande to support the charge.  Eventually she agreed.

In 1560, the case was tried in [[Rieux-Volvestre|Rieux]]. Bertrande testified that at first she had honestly believed the man to be her husband, but that she had since realized that he was a fraud. Both Bertrande and the accused independently related an identical story about their intimate life from before 1548.

The man claiming to be Martin then challenged her: if she would swear that he was not her husband, he would gladly agree to be executed &amp;ndash; Bertrande remained silent. After hearing from more than 150 witnesses, with many testifying they recognized Martin Guerre (including his four sisters), many others testifying to Arnaud du Tilh's identity, and others refusing to take a side, the accused impostor was convicted and sentenced to death by beheading.

=== Appeal in Toulouse; Martin Guerre reappears ===
The condemned man immediately appealed to the [[parlement of Toulouse|''Parlement'' of Toulouse]].  Officials arrested Bertrande and Pierre on charges of possible false accusation and, in the case of Pierre, soliciting [[perjury]]. The new Martin eloquently argued his case, and the judges in Toulouse tended to believe his version of the story: that Bertrande was pressured to perjury by the greedy Pierre Guerre. The accused had to undergo detailed questioning about his past; his statements were double-checked, and no contradictions were found.

Then, dramatically, a man appeared in Toulouse during the trial, with a wooden leg, claiming to be the true Martin Guerre. When asked about the married couple's past, the man had forgotten some details and was not able to answer the questions as well as the alleged impostor; however, when the two men were both presented to the Guerre family, the case was closed: Pierre, Bertrande, and Martin's four sisters all agreed that the newly arrived man was the true Martin Guerre.

The impostor Arnaud du Tilh, who maintained his innocence, was convicted and sentenced to death for adultery and fraud; the public sentencing on 12 September 1560 was attended by [[Michel de Montaigne]]. Afterward, the condemned confessed: he had learned about Guerre's life after two men had confused him with Guerre; he had then decided to take Guerre's place, with two conspirators helping him with the details. He apologized to all involved, including Bertrande, for having deceived them.  He was [[hanging|hanged]] in front of Martin Guerre's house in Artigat four days later.

=== Martin's story ===
During his long absence from Artigat, the real Martin Guerre had moved to [[Spain]], where he served in the militia for a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and next in the army of [[Pedro de Mendoza]].{{cn|date=March 2017}} As part of the Spanish army, he was sent to [[Flanders]] and participated in the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Spanish attack on St. Quentin]] on 10 August 1557. There, he was wounded, and his leg had to be amputated.&lt;ref name="Davis-1983" /&gt;

Guerre lived for years in a monastery before returning to his wife and family.{{cn|date=March 2017}} The reason for his return at the time of the trial is unknown. Initially, he rejected his wife's apologies, maintaining that she should have known better than to take another man.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

== Contemporary accounts and interpretations ==
Two contemporary accounts of the case were written: ''Histoire Admirable'' by Guillaume Le Sueur and the better-known ''Arrest Memorable'' by [[Jean de Coras]], one of the trial judges in Toulouse.

In 1983, [[Princeton University]] history professor [[Natalie Zemon Davis]] published a detailed exploration of the case in her book ''The Return of Martin Guerre''.  She argued that Bertrande had silently or explicitly agreed to the fraud because she needed a husband in that society, and she was treated well by Arnaud. Davis noted as evidence for this theory the improbability of a woman's mistaking a stranger for her husband, Bertrande's support for Arnaud until (and even partially during) the trial, and their shared story of intimacy, likely prepared in advance.

The historian Robert Finlay has criticized Davis's conclusions, arguing that Bertrande was duped (as most of her contemporaries believed, including the trial judges) after her husband's long absence.  He thought that Davis attempted to read-in a modern societal model of an independent woman making her own choices onto the historical account. He points to the improbability of Bertrande's charging her own accomplice with fraud, as she would run the risk of having to defend herself against charges of adultery or false accusation.&lt;ref name="Finlay"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finlay|first1=Robert|title=The Refashioning of Martin Guerre|journal=The American Historical Review|date=June 1988|volume=93|issue=3|doi=10.2307/1868102|pages=553–571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis responded to Finlay's arguments in her article "On the Lame" in the same issue of ''The American Historical Review'' in June 1988.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Natalie Zemon|title=On the Lame|journal=American Historical Review|date=June 1988|volume=93|issue=3|pages=572–603|doi=10.2307/1868103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and popular culture==
The unusual story has continued to fascinate and inspire many writers:

*[[Alexandre Dumas, père]], included a fictional account of the events in his novel ''[[The Two Dianas]]'', as well as in his multi-volume ''Celebrated Crimes'' (1841).
*[[Janet Lewis]]'s historical novel, ''[[The Wife of Martin Guerre]]'' (1941), is a fictional exploration of Bertrande and her motives for her actions.
*  [[Philip K. Dick]]'s 1955 short story "[[Human Is]]" tells of the dilemma for the wife of a cold abusive man who returns from a mission changed for the better. The story was dramatized in the 2017 TV series  ''[[Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams|Electric Dreams]]'', which also features the man on trial as an alien imposter, who is saved by the testimony of his wife.
* ''The Wife of Martin Guerre'' (1956) is an [[opera]] by the [[United States|American]] composer [[William Bergsma]] with a [[libretto]] by [[Janet Lewis]].
* The 1982 film ''[[Le Retour de Martin Guerre]]'' (''The Return of Martin Guerre''), directed by [[Daniel Vigne]] and starring [[Gérard Depardieu]] and [[Nathalie Baye]], was based on the historic accounts.  The screenplay added a fictional ending, including an account of Bertrande's motives. Historian Davis (see above) served as consultant for the film.
* ''The True Story of Martin Guerre'', a [[BBC Radio 4]] two-part drama by Guy Meredith from the trial notes of [[Jean de Coras]], first broadcast in June 1992 and starring [[Sean Bean]] as both Martin Guerre and the Imposter and [[Lesley Dunlop]] as Bertrande.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Times 1923 - 2009|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/radio4/fm/1996-06-28|website=BBC  Genome BETA|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also uses the same fictionalized motives of Bertrande as in the Depardieu film, and was rebroadcast in February 2016 and August 2018 on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]]..
* ''[[Sommersby]]'' (1993) was an American Hollywood adaptation of the story, starring [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Richard Gere]].  It set the events in the [[United States]] during and after the [[American Civil War]].
* The [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[The House of Martin Guerre]]'' (1993) was based on the case and first produced in Toronto.
* The musical ''[[Martin Guerre (musical)|Martin Guerre]]'' (1996), by [[Claude-Michel Schönberg]] and [[Alain Boublil]], premiered in [[London]] at the [[Prince Edward Theatre]].  It set the story at the time of the [[Massacre of St. Bartholomew]], during the French government's persecution of the Huguenots.  Its ending deviated from the historical account.
* ''Wiedersehen mit einem Fremden'' (''The Return of a Stranger''), a 2010 German [[TV]] film, directed by Niki Stein, sets the account in a village in the [[Black Forest]] after [[World War II]]. The end differs from the historic events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvspielfilm.de/kino/filmarchiv/film/wiedersehen-mit-einem-fremden,4128676,ApplicationMovie.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another musical titled ''Martin Guerre'', written by Laura Harrington and Roger Ames, was premiered at the Hartford Stage, 1993, directed by Mark Lamos and starring Judy Kuhn.  It won the Connecticut "Best Play" award that year and had a sold-out, extended run into 1994.
*''[[The Simpsons]]'' season 9 episode ''[[The Principal and the Pauper]]'' is sometimes noted for its similarities to the case, with Principal Seymour Skinner discovered to be an imposter after the real Skinner returns to Springfield.  However, the episode's writer, [[Ken Keeler]], has stated that, "This episode is not—despite what people have been saying for eight years—based on or a rip-off of or a goof on the story of Martin Guerre."  He went on to clarify: "The pattern of facts is clearly the [[Tichborne_case|Tichborne claimant story]], and ''not'' Martin Guerre."&lt;ref name="Keeler"&gt;Keeler, Ken. (2006). Commentary for "The Principal and the Pauper", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox, 4:24–4:51.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The first feature film produced in the country of [[East Timor]], ''[[Beatriz's War]]'' (2013), reprised the plot of Martin Guerre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/review/beatrizs-war-review&lt;/ref&gt;
*Martin Guerre is mentioned in the pilot episode of the British sitcom ''[[Back (TV series)|Back]]'' (2017).

In [[the United States]], '''Obama-Trump voters''' (also known as '''Trump Democrats''') voted for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] and/or [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]]s, but later defected from their party to vote for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee [[Donald Trump]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]].

==Studies==
A study by the [[Democracy Fund]] Voter Study Group found that 9.2% of Obama voters voted for Trump in 2016.&lt;ref name=cohn/&gt; According to the [[American National Election Study]], 13% of Trump voters had voted for Obama in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvjke5/regretful-trump-voters-i-dont-understand-how-it-could-be-worse |title=Regretful Trump Voters: 'I Don’t Understand How It Could Be Worse' |last=Dent |first=David |date=2017-09-20 |website=Vice |language=en-us |access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts have argued that these voters had a disproportionately large impact on the 2016 election because they were concentrated in key [[swing state]]s in the [[United States Midwest|Midwest]], while others have said that they were actually "Obama Republicans" rather than Democrats to begin with.&lt;ref name=cohn&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/upshot/the-obama-trump-voters-are-real-heres-what-they-think.html |title=The Obama-Trump Voters Are Real.

==Significance==
[[Dana Milbank]] has disputed both the quantity and the significance of Obama-Trump voters in deciding the outcome of the 2016 election. Milbank argued in an August 2017 ''[[Washington Post]]'' column that the number of such voters was initially overstated, and that most of them were Republicans who only defected from their party to vote for Obama, not Democrats who defected to support Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/08/may-not-be-as-many-trump-democrats-as-previously-imagined.html |title=There May Not Be As Many ‘Trump Democrats’ As Previously Imagined |last=Kilgore |first=Ed |date=2017-08-04 |website=Daily Intelligencer |language=en |access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nate Cohn responded to Milbank's criticism by arguing that Milbank's focus on national data obscured the magnitude of Democratic defection to support Trump. Cohn noted that when looking specifically at white Obama voters with no higher education than a [[high school diploma]], Clinton only won 74% (based on data from the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group) or 78% (based on the [[Cooperative Congressional Election Study]] (CCES)).&lt;ref name=cohn/&gt;
==Voters' views==
Shortly before the 2016 election, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that Obama voters who now planned to vote for Trump felt that Trump was now the embodiment of the "change" they had hoped for when they voted for Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/us/politics/obama-donald-trump-voting.html |title=Some Who Saw Change in Obama Find It Now in Donald Trump |last=Alcindor |first=Yamiche |date=2016-11-02 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-02-25 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple [[focus group]]s of Obama-Trump voters convened by the [[Roosevelt Institute]] and [[Democracy Corps]] in early 2017 showed that, in general, these voters wanted to change the [[status quo]], and had skeptical views of Congressional Republicans and their proposals. The same focus groups also indicated that these voters hoped that President Trump would help reduce health care costs for working-class Americans, and that they were anxious about some immigrant groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://rooseveltinstitute.org/obama-trump-voters-expect-change-dont-trust-gop/ |title=Focus Group: Obama-to-Trump Voters Expect Change, Don't Trust GOP to Deliver |date=2017-03-15 |website=Roosevelt Institute |language=en-US |access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey conducted by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group found that Obama-Trump voters generally had liberal views on economic issues, but conservative views on social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2017/6/16/15817702/democrats-economics-trump-obama-voters |title=Democrats are unlikely to win back Obama-Trump voters. But they should still have an economic agenda to help them. |date=2017-06-16 |website=Vox |access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the CCES indicate that 75% of Obama-Trump voters supported repealing the [[Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/08/trump-democrats-are-rare-but-electorally-important.html |title=Trump Democrats Are Rare — But Electorally Important |last=Levitz |first=Eric |date=2017-08-16 |website=Daily Intelligencer |language=en |access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for President Trump==
A September 2017 poll found that 70% of Obama-Trump voters approved of the job Trump was doing as president. This figure was significantly lower than the 88% approval rating among all Trump voters. Similarly, the percent of voters who disapprove of Trump's performance in this poll was much higher among Obama-Trump voters (22%) than among Trump voters as a whole (9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/06/trump-obama-voters-poll-242334 |title=Poll: Obama-Trump voters drifting away from the president |date=2017-09-06 |website=POLITICO |access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19801">'''Particular social group''' ('''PSG''') is one of five categories that may be used to claim refugee status according to two key [[United Nations]] documents: the 1951 [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] and the 1967 [[Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees]]. The other four categories are [[race (human classification)|race]], [[religion]], [[nationality]], and [[political opinion]]. As the most ambiguous and open-ended of the categories, the PSG category has been the subject of considerable debate and controversy in refugee law.&lt;ref name=unhcr-guidance&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unhcr.org/3d58de2da.html|title = GUIDELINES ON INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION: "Membership of a particular social group" within the context of Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention and/or its 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees|publisher = UNHCR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dhs-debate&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/hot-topics-asylum-examination-particular-social-group-and-other-serious-harm|title = Hot Topics in Asylum: An Examination of Particular Social Group and Other Serious Harm|publisher = [[Department of Homeland Security]]|date = June 29, 2012|accessdate = July 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that just as with the other four categories, membership in a PSG is not sufficient grounds for being granted refugee status. Rather, to be granted refugee status, one must both demonstrate membership in one of the five categories (race, religion, nationality, particular political opinion, and particular social group) and a ''nexus'' between that membership and persecution one is facing or risks facing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Humanitarian/Refugees%20%26%20Asylum/Asylum/AOBTC%20Lesson%20Plans/Nexus-the-Five-Protected-Characteristics-31aug10.pdf|title = Asylum Eligibility Part Three: Nexus and the Five Protected Characteristics|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = September 26, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150927121005/http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Humanitarian/Refugees%20%26%20Asylum/Asylum/AOBTC%20Lesson%20Plans/Nexus-the-Five-Protected-Characteristics-31aug10.pdf#|archive-date = 2015-09-27|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://irishlawjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Nexus-with-a-Convention-Ground-The-Particular-Social-Group-and-Sexual-Minority-Refugees-in-Ireland-and-the-United-Kingdom.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928023556/http://irishlawjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Nexus-with-a-Convention-Ground-The-Particular-Social-Group-and-Sexual-Minority-Refugees-in-Ireland-and-the-United-Kingdom.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 28, 2015 |title=Nexus with a Convention Ground: The Particular Social Group and Sexual Minority Refugees in Ireland and the United Kingdom |journal=[[Irish Law Journal]] |year=2012 |volume=1 |pages=93 |accessdate=September 26, 2015 |last=Arnold |first=Samantha K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PSG determination is part of the general refugee determination process in most countries that are signatories to the 1951 Convention. In particular, these decisions are made by the immigration bureaucracies, immigration courts, and the general courts (to which immigration decisions may need to be appealed). Past decisions create guidelines and precedents for future decisions in the same country. In general, decisions in one country do not create precedents for decisions in other countries, but there is some influence through the influence on periodically updated UNHCR guidelines and through lawyers' use of these cases. Two particularly seminal decisions influencing PSG determination worldwide have been ''Matter of Acosta'' (1985, United States), and ''Ward'' (1993, Canada).

Examples of PSGs identified in various countries include women (and various subsets thereof), homosexuals and others with non-mainstream sexual orientations, specific families, and the poor.&lt;ref name=irb/&gt;

== United Nations documents ==

In 2002, the [[United Nations High Commission for Refugees]] (UNHCR) published updated guidance for the interpretation of the PSG category.&lt;ref name=unhcr-guidance/&gt;

=== Broad guidelines ===

* The PSG category is not meant to be used as a catch-all, and a PSG cannot be defined ''exclusively'' based on persecution. In other words, just the fact that a person is persecuted does not make the person a member of a PSG.
* There is no closed list of PSGs. Rather, membership in a PSG should evolve over time, based on the diverse and changing nature of different groups and evolving international human rights norms.
* The Convention grounds are not mutually exclusive. A person may claim refugee status based on membership in a PSG as well as the other grounds such as religion or political opinion, if they apply.

=== Two approaches: protected characteristics (immutability) and social perception ===

The UNHCR document identified two approaches have been used to determine membership in and legitimacy of PSGs:

# The '''protected characteristics''' (or '''immutability''') approach: This approach examines whether a group is united by one of these:
#* An innate immutable characteristic (such as sex or ethnicity)
#* An immutable characteristic that is not innate but is unalterable for other reasons (such as the historical fact of a past association, occupation, or status)
#* A characteristic that is so fundamental to human dignity that a person should not be required to change it.
# The '''social perception''' approach: This approach examines whether or not the group shares a common characteristic which makes them a cognizable group or sets them apart from the society at large.

The UNHCR document provides the following guidance regarding the interpretation of the protected characteristic approach:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A particular social group is a group of persons who share a common characteristic other than their risk of being persecuted, or who are perceived as a group by society.  The characteristic will often be one which is innate, unchangeable, or which is otherwise fundamental to identity, conscience or the exercise of one’s human rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Additional observations ===

The UNHCR document offered the following additional guidelines regarding PSG membership:

* Persecution cannot alone be used to define PSG status, but it can be part of the social perception case for PSG status, i.e., the fact that people having a characteristic are persecuted is evidence that that characteristic is socially perceived as making them a distinct group.
* The PSG need not be cohesive, i.e., the members may not know one another or be coordinating towards any common goal.
* Not all members of the PSG need be persecuted. The document notes that members of the group may not be at risk if, for example, they hide their shared characteristic, they are not known to the persecutors, or they cooperate with the persecutor.
* The size of a PSG should not be a relevant consideration. PSGs can range from small minorities to groups such as "women" (who constitute about half the population).
* Persecution by non-state actors is relevant if either the persecution itself is targeted based on membership in the PSG, ''or'' the state's unwillingness to help the victim of persecution is due to the victim's membership in the PSG.

== United States ==

The application of the PSG criterion in the United States is governed by decisions and clarifications made by the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]] as well as the [[United States courts of appeals]]. Officials and judges have considerable interpretive latitude in determining PSG status.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

=== Membership in a particular social group must be based on a characteristic that one either cannot change or should not be forced to change ===

In ''Matter of Acosta'' (1985), the Board of Immigration Appeals interpreted the 1951 Convention to come up with a rule of thumb for determining what constitutes a PSG for the purpose of the Convention. BIA compared it to the other four grounds for refugee status, and noted that two of them (race and nationality) were based on characteristics that one ''cannot'' change, whereas the other two (religion and political opinion) were based on characteristics one ''should not be required to change''. Generalizing from this, they argued that for a group to qualify as a PSG for the purpose of refugee status, it must be either a characteristic one cannot change or a characteristic one should not be required to change.&lt;ref name=nijc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.immigrantjustice.org/sites/default/files/PSG%2520Practice%2520Advisory%2520and%2520Appendices-Final-1.22.16.pdf |title=Particular Social Group Practice Advisory: Applying for Asylum After Matter of M-E-V-G-and Matter of W-G-R |publisher=[[National Immigrant Justice Center]] |date=January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach would be characterized by the UNHCR in 2002 as the "protected characteristics" approach.&lt;ref name=unhcr-guidance/&gt;

=== Particularity and social visibility ===

Drawing on the 2002 UNHCR guidelines, a series of decisions by BIA made 2008 onward gave importance to two additional criteria for defining a PSG: particularity and social visibility. However, unlike the UNHCR guidelines, which suggested social visibility as a way to identify PSGs that might get filtered out by the protected characteristics  approach, the BIA decisions endorsed the logic that these criteria need to be met over and above the protected characteristic criterion.&lt;ref name=nijc/&gt;&lt;ref name=unlv&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://scholars.law.unlv.edu/facpub/419 |title=The Emerging Importance of 'Social Visibility' in Defining a Particular Social Group and Its Potential Impact on Asylum Claims Related to Sexual Orientation and Gender |last1=Marouf |first1=Fatma E. |journal=[[Yale Law and Policy Review]] |volume=47 |pages=419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lexisnexis-2008&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/immigration/b/insidenews/archive/2014/02/07/new-bia-precedent-decisions-on-social-group-social-visibility.aspx|title = New BIA Precedent Decisions on Social Group, Social Visibility|last = Kowalski|first = Daniel|date = February 7, 2014|accessdate = July 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Particularity''': The social group in question must be identified in the broader society as a discrete class of persons.
# '''Social visibility''': Membership in the social group should generally be recognizable by others in the community.

The BIA decisions received criticism from many angles. Some critics argued that the notions of particularity and social visibility had been conflated, and that the decision left unclear whether social visibility ought to be interpreted as literal or figurative visibility.&lt;ref name=unlv/&gt;

== Australia ==

Refugee law in Australia is decided ''de facto'' by refugee tribunals and the [[Federal Court of Australia]]. As with the United States, judges have considerable interpretive latitude and decisions create precedents for further decisions.

=== Discretion requirement ===

One of the distinguishing features of the PSG definition in Australia has been the ''discretion'' requirement, particularly in connection with sexuality. While the Australian courts have generally accepted that if somebody needs to hide his or her political or religious beliefs in order be free from persecution, that itself counts as persecution, the same logic was not applied to homosexuality or other non-standard sexual orientations. The courts have upheld the view that sexuality is not something that one needs to openly disclose, so if one can be free from persecution by hiding it, then one does not qualify for refugee status. This contradicts the view expressed in UNHCR documents, where it is said that people's ability to prevent persecution by hiding their status does not undermine the case for persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Before the High Court. Applicants S396/2002 and S395/2002, a gay refugee couple from Bangladesh |last1=Dauvergne |first1=Catherine |last2=Millbank |first2=Jenni |journal=[[Sydney Law Review]] |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=97–124 |hdl=10453/866 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==

The [[Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada]] is responsible for guidelines related to determining refugee status, including criteria for membership in a particular social group.&lt;ref name=irb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/Eng/BoaCom/references/LegJur/Pages/RefDef04.aspx|title = Chapter 4: Grounds of Persecution|publisher = [[Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada]]|accessdate = August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRB and various scholars of Canadian refugee law have identified two key [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decisions that have helped delineate the definition of PSG: ''Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward'' (1993) and ''Chan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)'' (1995).&lt;ref name=irb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/ohlj/vol35/iss3/23 |title=The Cases of Ward and Chan |journal=Osgoode Hall Law Journal |volume=35 |issue=3/4 |year=1997 |pages=723–36 |last1=Shacter |first1=Ron }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ward&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrcr.org/safrica/freedom_security/canada_ward.html|title = Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689|accessdate = September 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrcr.org/safrica/freedom_security/chan_canada.html|title = Chan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)|accessdate = September 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ward'' decision cited the Supreme Court's use of tests in ''Mayers'', ''Cheung'', and the United States' ''Matter of Acosta'' to identify three possible categories of PSGs:&lt;ref name=irb/&gt;

# Groups defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic;
# groups whose members voluntarily associate for reasons so fundamental to their human dignity that they should not be forced to forsake the association; and
# groups associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historical permanence.

The IRB has identified the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]'s decision in ''Ward'' as providing an interpretative foundation for PSG membership.&lt;ref name=irb/&gt;

The categories identified in ''Ward'' were further clarified in ''Chan'':&lt;ref name=irb/&gt;

# The Ward decision enunciated a working rule and "not an unyielding deterministic approach to resolving whether a refugee claimant could be classified within a particular social group." The paramount consideration in determining a particular social group is the "general underlying themes of the defence of human rights and anti-discrimination."
# The "is versus does" distinction was not intended to replace the Ward categories. There must be proper consideration of the context in which the claim arose.
# With respect to category two of the Ward categories and the position taken by the Court of Appeal in Chan that this category required an active association between members of the group, Mr. Justice La Forest stated: "In order to avoid any confusion on this point let me state incontrovertibly that a refugee alleging membership in a particular social group does not have to be in voluntary association with other persons similar to him- or herself."

PSGs identified in Canadian jurisprudence include the family, homosexuals, trade unions, the poor, women subject to abuse or coercion of various kinds, and others.&lt;ref name=irb/&gt;

== United Kingdom ==

Asylum cases are first processed by the Home Office. They may be appealed to the First-Tier Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chambers. The unsuccessful side may appeal to the Upper Tribunal. The unsuccessful side may then appeal to the Court of Appeal. Precedents may be set by previous decisions at each stage.

Asylum decisions in the UK based on particular social groups have stressed the need to make a two-fold case:&lt;ref name=women-psg&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=2263350|title = Women as a Particular Social Group: A Comparative Assessment of Gender Asylum Claims in the United States and United Kingdom|author = Bethany Christa Lobo|journal = Georgetown Immigration Law Review|volume = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The persecution requirement: The applicant must demonstrate persecution or risk of persecution from staying in his or her homeland.
* The nexus requirement: The applicant must demonstrate the connection between the persecution and membership in the particular social group.

=== Tests for domestic violence asylum decisions ===

In 1999, the House of Lords in the United Kingdom granted asylum to two Pakistani women based on severe violence they faced at their husbands' hands and their fears of false charges of adultery. The case established ''three'' necessary conditions for women to get asylum for domestic violence based on particular social group status:&lt;ref name=women-psg/&gt;

# A failure of state protection
# Women in her state are treated sufficiently poorly as to constitute a PSG
# She lacks an internal flight alternative, i.e., she cannot realistically relocate elsewhere within the country and avoid persecution.

==Biography==
Pedro Pardo de Cela was a feudal lord. Supporter of the Infanta [[Joanna la Beltraneja]], the death of her father, [[Henry IV of Castile]] faced the policy of the new kings of Castile, [[Isabella I of Castile]] and her husband, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]].

He was married to the daughter of the first Earl of Lemos, Isabel Perez Osorio. The latter came with his uncle, Pedro Enríquez, bishop of Mondoñedo, city of Mondoñedo, where Pardo de Cela was merino representing the House of Lemos. Bishop Pedro Enriquez gave her wedding dowry in 1441 all the revenues of the bishopric, except those needed for their livelihood, made up most of the castles and fortresses of the bishopric dependent, counting among them the reconstructed castle Frouxeira . Bishop Pedro Enriquez had previously been cantor of the Cathedral of Orense, the son of Enrique Enriquez, brother Fadrique Enríquez of Castile, Duke of Arjona.

He died a bishop in 1445, he moved to Vivero, where he became mayor in 1474 obtaining the title of marshal. Buy the "casa do Carballo of Galdo," head of his morgado. In the year 1476 it is removed from the hall by the Catholic Monarchs. In 1478 he was expelled from Vivero and the Catholic Monarchs wrote to the municipalities of Santa Marta de Ortigueira and Mondoñedo so they would not allow their entry. Ask for a letter of "safe harbor" to the Kings and took refuge in the Castle gives Frouxeira, where he is strong with "the other two Pedros", Pedro de Bolaño and Pedro de Miranda, and defeat the Spanish troops, commanded by Fernando Cunha, son of the Count of Buendia, and Luis de Mudarra, who came to Galicia in September 1480 to "pacify" the Kingdom.

Pedro Pardo de Cela's last will was found in 2013, and it revealed that many of the stories told about him were not true.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/01/22/galicia/1358860127_276594.html Hallado el testamento del mariscal Pardo de Cela] El Pais. {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Percy Arrowsmith''' (March 13, 1900 – June 15, 2005) and '''Flo(rence) Arrowsmith''' (October 31, 1904 – April 9, 2007) were, until Percy's death, a long time married couple residing in [[Hereford]], [[England]].

==Life==
On June 1, 2005 they erroneously made it into the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' for the longest marriage for a living couple and the oldest aggregate age of a married couple. They had been married for 80 years, having married in [[Hereford]] in 1925, three years after they met.

However, ''[[Le Monde]]'' newspaper revealed that one couple in [[France]] was even older than the Arrowsmiths: [[André Debry|André Léon Alphonse Debry]] (June 15, 1898 - August 31, 2005) and Marguerite Pingaud (October 10, 1903 - January 2006) were married on August 12, 1924 and celebrated their 81st wedding anniversary in August 2005 shortly before the husband's death.

Percy died only exactly two weeks later on at age 105 and Florence died almost two years afterwards at age 102.

'''Pierrette Ringuette''' (born December 31, 1955), also formerly known as '''Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais''', is a [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]].

Ringuette, a businesswoman and professor, was the first [[francophone]] woman to be elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]]. She sat in the body as a member of the [[New Brunswick Liberal Party]] beginning in 1987.

In the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]], she won a [[parliamentary seat|seat]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] as the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Madawaska—Victoria]] by defeating [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] [[Canadian cabinet|Cabinet Minister]] [[Bernard Valcourt]].

She was defeated in the subsequent [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 federal election]], one of a number of [[Maritimes|Maritime]] Liberal MPs who lost their seats that year.

After her electoral defeat, she joined [[Canada Post Corporation]] in a senior position as manager of the international trade development unit.

On December 12, 2002, she was appointed to the Senate on the recommendation of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]].

On January 29, 2014, Liberal Party leader [[Justin Trudeau]] announced all Liberal Senators, including Ringuette, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-removes-senators-from-liberal-caucus-1.2515273|title=Liberal leader says senators not welcome in caucus|website=Cbc.ca|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senators referred to themselves as the [[Senate Liberal Caucus]] even though they are no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus.&lt;ref name=expuls&gt;{{cite news|title=Trudeau’s expulsion catches Liberal senators by surprise|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-to-boot-senators-from-liberal-caucus-in-bid-to-restore-senate-independence/article16567413/|accessdate=January 29, 2014|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=January 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ringuette announced, on February 2, 2016 that she was leaving the Senate Liberal caucus to sit as an Independent saying, in a statement, that "Canadians have been clear in their desire for a non-partisan Senate. The status quo is not acceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photo GalleriesCBC SecureDrop Irving Gerstein retires from Senate, Pierrette Ringuette to sit as Independent|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/senator-ringuette-independent-caucus-1.3430433|accessdate=12 February 2016|work=CBC News|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from the [[University of Moncton]] and a [[Master of Business Administration]] from the [[University of Ottawa]]. She has completed the coursework for a [[Master of Industrial Relations]].

'''Rajmund Roman Thierry Polański''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|l|æ|n|s|k|i}}; born 18 August 1933) is a French-Polish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= [[AllMovie|All Movie Guide]] |url= https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/106743/Roman-Polanski/biography |title= Roman Polanski – Biography |website= [[The New York Times]] website |accessdate= 20 November 2013 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131124015517/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/106743/Roman-Polanski/biography |archivedate= 24 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; film director, producer, writer, and actor. Since 1978, he has been a fugitive from the U.S. [[criminal justice system]], having fled the country while awaiting sentencing in his [[Roman Polanski sexual abuse case|sexual abuse case]], where he pleaded guilty to [[statutory rape]].&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

Polanski was born in Paris, and his [[Polish-Jewish]] parents moved the family back to Poland in 1937, when he was four. Two years later Poland was [[Invasion of Poland|invaded by Nazi Germany and the USSR]] starting [[World War II]] and the Polanski's found themselves trapped in the [[Kraków Ghetto]].  After his mother and father were taken in raids, Polanski spent his formative years in foster homes under an adopted identity, trying to survive the [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="INA"&gt;{{Cite web | title= Mémoires de la Shoah: témoignage de Roman Polanski, enfant de déporté, enfant caché, né le 18 aoüt 1933 | author1=Roman Polanski | author2 = Catherine Bernstein | date = 5 May 2006 | language = fr | publisher=[[Institut_national_de_l'audiovisuel | INA]]| url=https://entretiens.ina.fr/memoires-de-la-shoah/Polanski/roman-polanski/sommaire  | accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Polanski's first feature-length film, ''[[Knife in the Water]]'' (1962), was made in Poland and was nominated for a United States [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].&lt;ref name="california"/&gt; He has since received five more [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations, along with two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTAs]], four [[César Award|Césars]], a [[Golden Globe]] Award and the [[Palme d'Or]] of the Cannes Film Festival in France. In the United Kingdom he directed three films, beginning with ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965). In 1968 he moved to the United States and cemented his status by directing the horror film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968).

A turning point in his life took place in 1969, when his pregnant wife, [[Sharon Tate]], and four friends were brutally murdered by members of the [[Manson Family]].&lt;ref name="Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" /&gt; Following her death, Polanski returned to Europe and eventually continued directing. He made ''[[Macbeth (1971 film)|Macbeth]]'' (1971) in England and back in Hollywood, ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974), which was nominated for eleven [[Academy Awards]].&lt;ref name="Chinatown1974 at IMDB" /&gt;

In 1977, Polanski was arrested and charged with [[Roman Polanski sexual abuse case|drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl]]. He subsequently pled guilty to the lesser offence of unlawful sex with a minor.&lt;ref name="In Polanski Case, '70s Culture Collides With Today" /&gt; After spending 42 days undergoing psychiatric evaluation in prison in preparation for sentencing, Polanski, who had expected to be put on probation, learned that the judge planned to imprison him, so he fled to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Lindsay|last=Kimble|url=http://www.people.com/article/roman-polanski-victim-samantha-geimer-interview|title=Roman Polanski's Victim Samantha Geimer Is 'Pleased' the Director Won't Be Extradited, Says She Recovered 'A Long Time Ago'|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=31 October 2015|accessdate=19 November 2018|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102024913/http://www.people.com/article/roman-polanski-victim-samantha-geimer-interview |archivedate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, Polanski continued to make films, including ''[[Tess (1979 film)|Tess]]'' (1979), starring [[Nastassja Kinski]]. It won France's [[César Award]]s for Best Picture and Best Director, and received three Oscars. He later produced and directed ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' (2002), a drama a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish-Polish]] musician escaping [[Nazi]] persecution, starring [[Adrien Brody]] and [[Emilia Fox]]. The film won three Academy Awards including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], along with numerous international awards. He also directed ''[[Oliver Twist (2005 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' (2005), a story which parallels his own life as a "young boy attempting to triumph over adversity".&lt;ref name="Freer" /&gt; He was awarded Best Director for ''[[The Ghost Writer (film)|The Ghost Writer]]'' (2010)  at the [[23rd European Film Awards]].&lt;ref name=winners&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europeanfilmacademy.org/the-european-film-awards/the-winners/ |title= The Winners |date= 4 December 2010 |work= europeanfilmacademy.org |publisher= [[European Film Academy]] |accessdate= 4 December 2014 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120728095621/http://www.europeanfilmacademy.org/the-european-film-awards/the-winners/ |archivedate= 28 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, in light of the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] and [[Time's Up (movement)|Time's Up]] movements, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] voted to expel Polanski from its membership because of the statutory rape case and several other accusations of [[child sexual abuse]] made against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-43994591|title=Bill Cosby and Roman Polanski expelled from Oscars academy|website=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|location=London, England|date=3 May 2018|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Polanski was born in [[Paris]]; he was the son of Bula (née Katz-Przedborska)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://znanepary.pl/roman-polanski-i-emmanuelle-seigner/ |title=Roman Polański i Emmanuelle Seigner |publisher=Znane Pary |date=26 December 2012 |accessdate=6 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210222848/http://znanepary.pl/roman-polanski-i-emmanuelle-seigner/ |archivedate=10 December 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ryszard Polański,&lt;ref name="RPinterviewsxv" /&gt; a painter and manufacturer of sculptures, who had changed his family name from Liebling.&lt;ref name="Roman Polanski Biography" /&gt; His mother had a daughter, Annette, by her previous husband. Annette managed to survive [[Auschwitz]], where her mother died, and left Poland forever for France.&lt;ref name="Biography" /&gt; Polański's father was [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish]] and originally from Poland; Polański's mother, born in Russia, had been raised Roman Catholic and was of half Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref name="Guardian profile" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roman Polanski, UXL Newsmakers, Find Articles at BNET.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="polanski8"/&gt;&lt;!-- Thus Roman Polanski was born as Rajmund Roman Thierry Polański, ''not'' Rajmund Roman Thierry Liebling a year later in 1933 --&gt; Polański's parents were both agnostics.&lt;ref name="adherents"/&gt; Polański, influenced by his education in the [[People's Republic of Poland]], said "I'm an atheist" in an interview about his film, ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cronin|first=Paul |title=Roman Polanski: Interviews|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=1578067995|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II ===
The Polański family moved back to the Polish city of [[Kraków]] in 1936,&lt;ref name="RPinterviewsxv" /&gt; and were living there when World War&amp;nbsp;II began with the [[invasion of Poland]]. [[General Government|Kraków was soon occupied]] by the German forces, and the racist and anti-Semitic [[Nuremberg Laws]] made the Polańskis targets of persecution, forcing them into the [[Kraków Ghetto]], along with thousands of the [[Holocaust in Poland|city's Jews]].&lt;ref name="INA"/&gt; Around the age of six, he attended primary school for only a few weeks, until "all the Jewish children were abruptly expelled," writes biographer Christopher Sandford. That initiative was soon followed by the requirement that all Jewish children over the age of twelve wear white armbands with a blue [[Star of David]] imprinted for visual identification. After he was expelled, he would not be allowed to enter another classroom for the next six years.&lt;ref name="RPinterviewsxv" /&gt;{{rp|18}}&lt;ref name="fail"&gt;{{cite book |first=Roman |last=Polański|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UkMRxv820VwC&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22hadn%27t+intended+to+give+refuge%22 |title=Roman |publisher=Morrow (''ibidem'') |date=1984 |page=93  |isbn=0688026214 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101113257/https://books.google.com/books?id=UkMRxv820VwC&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22hadn%27t+intended+to+give+refuge%22 |archivedate=1 January 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polanski then witnessed both the ghettoization of Kraków's Jews into a compact area of the city, and the subsequent deportation of all the ghetto's Jews to [[concentration camp|German death camps]]. He watched as his father was taken away. He remembers from age six, one of his first experiences of the terrors to follow:
{{Quote|I had just been visiting my grandmother&amp;nbsp;... when I received a foretaste of things to come. At first I didn't know what was happening. I simply saw people scattering in all directions. Then I realized why the street had emptied so quickly. Some women were being herded along it by German soldiers. Instead of running away like the rest, I felt compelled to watch.

One older woman at the rear of the column couldn't keep up. A German officer kept prodding her back into line, but she fell down on all fours,&amp;nbsp;... Suddenly a pistol appeared in the officer's hand. There was a loud bang, and blood came welling out of her back. I ran straight into the nearest building, squeezed into a smelly recess beneath some wooden stairs, and didn't come out for hours. I developed a strange habit: clenching my fists so hard that my palms became permanently calloused. I also woke up one morning to find that I had wet my bed.&lt;ref name="polanski0" /&gt;
}}

[[File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 06b.jpg|thumb|A [[A Jewish boy surrenders in Warsaw |well-known photograph]] of Polish Jews captured by Germans during the suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising]]
His father was transferred, along with thousands of other Jews, to [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]], a group of 49 German concentration camps in Austria. His mother was taken to [[Auschwitz]], and was killed soon after arriving. The forced exodus took place immediately after the German liquidation of the Kraków ghetto, a true-life backdrop to Polanski's film [[The Pianist (2002 film)|''The Pianist'']] (2002). Polanski, who was then hiding from the Germans, remembered seeing his father being marched off with a long line of people. Polanski tried getting closer to his father to ask him what was happening, and managed to get within a few yards. His father saw him, but afraid his son might be spotted by the German soldiers, whispered (in Polish), "Get lost!"&lt;ref name="RPinterviewsxv" /&gt;{{rp|24}}

Polański escaped the Kraków Ghetto in 1943 and survived by assuming the name Romek Wilk, with the [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|help]] of some Polish [[Roman Catholic]] families. One such good Samaritan was a Mrs. Sermak, who promised Polański's father that she would shelter him.&lt;ref name="RPinterviewsxv" /&gt;{{rp|21}} Polański attended church, learned to recite Catholic prayers by heart, and behaved outwardly as a Roman Catholic, although he was never baptized. His efforts to blend into a Catholic household failed miserably at least once, when the parish priest visiting the family posed questions to him one-on-one about the [[catechism]], and ultimately said, "You aren't one of us", he said.&lt;ref name="Roman73 snippet"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UkMRxv820VwC&amp;q=%22Black+Virgin+of+Czestochowa+above+my+desk%22&amp;dq=%22Black+Virgin+of+Czestochowa+above+my+desk%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FTQBU-CyI5PpoATJiIDACg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA | title=Roman | publisher=Morrow (ibidem) | year=1984 | page=73 | author=Roman Polański | isbn=0688026214 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101113257/https://books.google.com/books?id=UkMRxv820VwC&amp;q=%22Black+Virgin+of+Czestochowa+above+my+desk%22&amp;dq=%22Black+Virgin+of+Czestochowa+above+my+desk%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FTQBU-CyI5PpoATJiIDACg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA | archivedate=1 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment for helping a Jew in German-occupied Poland was death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard Z.|last=Chesnoff|title=Pack of Thieves: How Hitler and Europe Plundered the Jews and Committed the Greatest Theft in History |publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York city|date=1999|ISBN=978-0385720649|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As he roamed the countryside trying to survive in a Poland now occupied by German troops, he witnessed many horrors, such as being "forced to take part in a cruel and sadistic game in which German soldiers took shots at him for target practice."&lt;ref name="Freer" /&gt; Author [[Ian Freer]] concludes that Polanski's constant childhood fears and dread of violence have contributed to the "tangible atmospheres he conjures up on film."&lt;ref name="Freer" /&gt;

By the time the war ended in 1945, a [[Poland#World War II|fifth of the Polish population]] had been killed,&lt;ref name="countrystudies" /&gt; with the vast majority of the victims being civilians. Of those deaths, 3 million were [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]], which accounted for 90% of the country's [[The Holocaust#By country|Jewish population]].&lt;ref name="holocaust" /&gt; According to Sandford, Polanski would use the memory of his mother, her dress and makeup style, as a physical model for [[Faye Dunaway]]'s character in his film [[Chinatown (1974 film)|''Chinatown'']] (1974).&lt;ref name="RPinterviewsxv" /&gt;{{rp|13}}

=== After the war ===
After the war, he was reunited with his father and moved back to Kraków. His father remarried 21 December 1946 to Wanda Zajączkowska (a woman Polanski had never liked) and died of cancer in 1984. Time repaired the family contacts; Polanski visited them in Kraków, and relatives visited him in Hollywood and Paris. Polanski recalls the villages and families he lived with as relatively primitive by European standards:
{{Quote|They were really simple Catholic peasants. This Polish village was like the English village in ''Tess''. Very primitive. No electricity. The kids with whom I lived didn't know about electricity&amp;nbsp;... they wouldn't believe me when I told them it was enough to turn on a switch!&lt;ref name="RS" /&gt;
}}

He stated that "you must live in a [[Communist]] country to really understand how bad it can be. Then you will appreciate [[capitalism]]."&lt;ref name="RS" /&gt; He also remembered events at the war's end and his reintroduction to mainstream society when he was 12, forming friendships with other children, such as [[Roma Ligocka]], [[Ryszard Horowitz]] and his family.&lt;ref name="polanski1" /&gt;

=== Introduction to movies ===
Polanski's fascination with cinema began very early, when he was around age four or five. He recalls this period in an interview:
{{Quote|Even as a child, I always loved cinema and was thrilled when my parents would take me before the war. Then we were put into the ghetto in Krakòw and there was no cinema, but the Germans often showed newsreels to the people outside the ghetto, on a screen in the market place. And there was one particular corner where you could see the screen through the barbed wire. I remember watching with fascination, although all they were showing was the German army and German tanks, with occasional anti-Jewish slogans inserted on cards.&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt;
}}

After the war, he watched films, either at school or at a local cinema, using whatever pocket money he had. Polanski writes, "Most of this went on the movies, but movie seats were dirt cheap, so a little went a long way. I lapped up every kind of film."&lt;ref name="polanski2" /&gt; As time went on, movies became more than an escape into entertainment, as he explains:
{{Quote|Movies were becoming an absolute obsession with me. I was enthralled by everything connected with the cinema—not just the movies themselves but the aura that surrounded them. I loved the luminous rectangle of the screen, the sight of the beam slicing through the darkness from the projection booth, the miraculous synchronization of sound and vision, even the dusty smell of the tip-up seats. More than anything else though, I was fascinated by the actual mechanics of the process.&lt;ref name="polanski3" /&gt;
}} He was above all influenced by Sir [[Carol Reed]]'s ''[[Odd Man Out]]'' (1947) - "I still consider it as one of the best movies I've ever seen and a film which made me want to pursue this career more than anything else... I always dreamt of doing things of this sort or that style. To a certain extent I must say that I somehow perpetuate the ideas of that movie in what I do."&lt;ref name="polanski"&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Cronin|title=Roman Polanski: Interviews|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|location=Jackson, Mississippi|date=2005|ISBN=978-1-57806-800-5|pages=159, 189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career in Poland ==
[[File:Roman Polanski gwiazda Lodz.jpg|thumb|Polanski's star on the [[Łódź]] walk of fame]]

Polanski attended the [[National Film School in Łódź]], the third-largest city in Poland.&lt;ref name="Łódź"/&gt; In the 1950s, Polanski took up acting, appearing in [[Andrzej Wajda]]'s ''[[Pokolenie]]'' (''A Generation'', 1954) and in the same year in Silik Sternfeld's ''[[Zaczarowany rower]]'' (''Enchanted Bicycle'' or ''Magical Bicycle''). Polanski's directorial debut was also in 1955 with a short film ''Rower'' (''Bicycle''). ''Rower'' is a semi-autobiographical feature film, believed to be lost, which also starred Polanski. It refers to his real-life violent altercation with a notorious Kraków felon, Janusz Dziuba, who arranged to sell Polanski a bicycle, but instead beat him badly and stole his money. In real life, the offender was arrested while fleeing after fracturing Polanski's skull, and executed for three murders, out of eight prior such assaults which he had committed.&lt;ref name="thesmokinggun" /&gt; Several other short films made during his study at Łódź gained him considerable recognition, particularly ''[[Two Men and a Wardrobe]]'' (1958) and ''[[When Angels Fall]]'' (1959). He graduated in 1959.&lt;ref name="Łódź" /&gt;

=== 1960s ===
====''Knife in the Water'' (1962)====
Polanski's first feature-length film, ''[[Knife in the Water]]'', was also one of the first significant Polish films after the Second World War that did not have a war theme. Scripted by  [[Jerzy Skolimowski]], [[Jakub Goldberg]], and Polanski,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,102030,7114095,Spieprzaj_do_Hollywood_.html |title=Polanski and the writing of "Knife in the Water" |publisher=Wyborcza.pl |accessdate=19 July 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527213705/http://wyborcza.pl/1,102030,7114095,Spieprzaj_do_Hollywood_.html |archivedate=27 May 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Knife in the Water'' is about a wealthy, unhappily married couple who decide to take a mysterious hitchhiker with them on a weekend boating excursion. ''Knife in the Water'' was a major commercial success in the West and gave Polanski an international reputation. The film also earned its director his first Academy Award nomination (Best Foreign Language Film) in 1963. [[Leon Niemczyk]], who played Andrzej, was the only professional actor in the film. Jolanta Umecka, who played Krystyna, was discovered by Polanski at a swimming pool.&lt;ref name="california1"/&gt;

Polanski left then-communist Poland and moved to France, where he had already made two notable short films in 1961: ''[[The Fat and the Lean]]'' and ''[[Ssaki|Mammals]]''. While in France, Polanski contributed one segment ("La rivière de diamants") to the French-produced omnibus film, ''[[Les plus belles escroqueries du monde]]'' (English title: ''The Beautiful Swindlers'') in 1964. (He has since had the segment removed from all releases of the film.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://olivefilms.com/product/the-worlds-most-beautiful-swindlers/|title=The World's Most Beautiful Swindlers - Olive Films|website=olivefilms.com|accessdate=11 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428051213/https://olivefilms.com/product/the-worlds-most-beautiful-swindlers/|archivedate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Polanski found that in the early 1960s, the French film industry was [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] and generally unwilling to support a rising filmmaker of foreign origin.&lt;ref name="mississippi"/&gt;

====''Repulsion'' (1965)====
Polanski made three feature films in England, based on original scripts written by himself and [[Gérard Brach]], a frequent collaborator. ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965) is a psychological horror film focusing on a young [[Belgians|Belgian]] woman named Carol ([[Catherine Deneuve]]) who suffers from a physical and emotional dread of sexual intercourse. The film's themes, situations, visual motifs, and effects clearly reflect the influence of early [[surrealist]] cinema as well as horror movies of the 1950s—particularly [[Luis Buñuel]]'s ''[[Un chien Andalou]]'', [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''[[The Blood of a Poet]]'', [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]]'s ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Diabolique]]'' and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.

====''Cul-de-sac'' (1966)====
''[[Cul-de-sac (1966 film)|Cul-de-sac]]'' (1966) is a bleak [[nihilism|nihilist]] [[tragicomedy]] filmed on location in [[Northumberland]]. The tone and premise of the film owe a great deal to [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', along with aspects of [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]''.

====''The Fearless Vampire Killers/Dance of the Vampires'' (1967)====
''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]'' (1967) (known by its original title, "Dance of the Vampires" in most countries outside the United States) is a parody of vampire films. The plot concerns a buffoonish professor and his clumsy assistant, Alfred (played by Polanski), who are traveling through [[Transylvania]] in search of [[vampire]]s. ''The Fearless Vampire Killers'' was Polanski's first feature to be photographed in color with the use of [[Panavision]] lenses, and included a striking visual style with snow-covered, fairy-tale landscapes, similar to the work of Soviet fantasy filmmakers. In addition, the richly textured color schemes of the settings evoke the paintings of the Belarusian-Jewish artist [[Marc Chagall]], who provides the namesake for the innkeeper in the film. The film was written for [[Jack MacGowran]], who played the lead role of Professor Abronsius.

Polanski met [[Sharon Tate]] while making the film; she played the role of the local innkeeper's daughter. They were married in London on {{Nowrap|20 January}} 1968.&lt;ref name="polanski4" /&gt; Shortly after they married, Polanski, with Tate at his side during a documentary film, described the demands of young movie viewers who he said always wanted to see something "new" and "different".&lt;ref&gt;video:[https://vimeo.com/135750398#t=8m4s ''The New Cinema'' (1968)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911170248/https://vimeo.com/135750398 |date=11 September 2015 }}, fair use clip&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Rosemary's Baby'' (1968)====
Paramount studio head [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]] brought Polanski to America ostensibly to direct the film ''Downhill Racer'', but told Polanski that he really wanted to him to read the horror novel ''[[Rosemary's Baby (novel)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' by [[Ira Levin]]&lt;ref name="california2"/&gt; to see if a film could be made out of it.&lt;ref name="christopher"/&gt; Polanski read it non-stop through the night and the following morning decided he wanted to write as well as direct it. He wrote the 272-page screenplay for the film in slightly longer than three weeks.&lt;ref name="christopher3"/&gt; The film, ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), was a box-office success and became his first Hollywood production, thereby establishing his reputation as a major commercial filmmaker. The film, a horror-thriller set in trendy Manhattan, is about Rosemary Woodhouse ([[Mia Farrow]]),&lt;ref name="publishing4"/&gt; a young housewife who is impregnated by the devil. Polanski's screenplay adaptation earned him a second Academy Award nomination.

On 9 August 1969, while Polanski was working in London, his wife, Sharon Tate, and four other people were murdered at the Polanskis' residence in Los Angeles by cult leader [[Charles Manson]]'s [[Manson family|followers]].&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;

=== 1970s ===
====''Macbeth'' (1971)====
Polanski adapted ''[[Macbeth]]'' into a screenplay with the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] expert [[Kenneth Tynan]].&lt;ref name="publishing5"/&gt; [[Jon Finch]] and [[Francesca Annis]] played the main characters.&lt;ref name="Bate, Jonath page 132"/&gt; [[Hugh Hefner]] and Playboy Productions funded [[Macbeth (1971 film)|the 1971 film]], which opened in New York and was screened in Playboy Theater.&lt;ref name="california6"/&gt; Hefner was credited as executive producer, and the film was listed as a "Playboy Production".&lt;ref name="shakespeare"/&gt; It was controversial because of Lady Macbeth's being nude in a scene,&lt;ref name="Bate, Jonath page 132" /&gt; and received an X rating because of its graphic violence and nudity.&lt;ref name="shakespeare7"/&gt; In his autobiography, Polanski wrote that he wanted to be true to the violent nature of the work, and that he had been aware that his first project following Tate's murder would be subject to scrutiny and probable criticism regardless of the subject matter; if he had made a comedy he would have been perceived as callous.&lt;ref name="polanski5" /&gt;

====''What?'' (1973)====
Written by Polanski and previous collaborator [[Gérard Brach]], ''[[What? (film)|What?]]'' (1973) is a mordant [[absurdist fiction|absurdist]] comedy loosely based on the themes of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' and [[Henry James]]. The film is a rambling [[shaggy dog story]] about the sexual indignities that befall a winsome young American [[hippie]] woman hitchhiking through Europe.

====''Chinatown'' (1974)====
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = #e1fcff|quote=Polanski was an outstanding director.

Polanski returned to Hollywood in 1973 to direct ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974) for [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film is widely considered to be one of the finest American mystery crime movies, inspired by the real-life [[California Water Wars]], a series of disputes over southern California water at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/bfi-film-releases/chinatown| title=Chinatown| accessdate=3 September 2013| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904201934/http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/bfi-film-releases/chinatown| archivedate=4 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including those for actors [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Faye Dunaway]]. [[Robert Towne]] won for Best Original Screenplay.&lt;ref name="Chinatown1974 at IMDB" /&gt; It also had actor-director [[John Huston]] in a supporting role,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnptsyyut6A John Huston Retrospective Trailer: "Chinatown"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213215611/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnptsyyut6A |date=13 December 2017 }}, ''Film Society of Lincoln Center''&lt;/ref&gt; and was the last film Polanski directed in the United States. In 1991, the film was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" and it is frequently listed as among [[List of films considered the best|the best in world cinema]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/best-film-ever-chinatown-season | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Andrew | last=Pulver | title=Chinatown: the best film of all time | date=22 October 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010211710/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/best-film-ever-chinatown-season | archivedate=10 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/momentsindx.html|title=100 Greatest Films|work=filmsite.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014162835/http://www.filmsite.org/momentsindx.html|archivedate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/greatest-film-ever-chinatown-wins-by-a-nose-20101023-16yk6.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Greatest film ever: Chinatown wins by a nose | date=24 October 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321002324/http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/greatest-film-ever-chinatown-wins-by-a-nose-20101023-16yk6.html | archivedate=21 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Tenant'' (1976)====
Polanski returned to Paris for his next film, ''[[The Tenant]]'' (1976), which was based on a 1964 novel by [[Roland Topor]], a French writer of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish origin]]. In addition to directing the film, Polanski also played a leading role of a timid Polish immigrant living in Paris. Together with ''Repulsion'' and ''Rosemary's Baby'', ''The Tenant'' can be seen as the third installment in a loose trilogy of films called the "Apartment Trilogy" that explore the themes of social alienation and psychic and emotional breakdown.&lt;ref name="trilogy" /&gt;

In 1978, Polanski [[Roman Polanski sexual abuse case|became a fugitive]] from American justice and could no longer work in countries where he might face arrest or extradition.

====''Tess'' (1979)====
He dedicated his next film, ''[[Tess (1979 film)|Tess]]'' (1979), to the memory of his late wife, [[Sharon Tate]]. It was Tate who first suggested he read ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', which she thought would make a good film; he subsequently expected her to star in it.&lt;ref name=People&gt;[http://people.com/archive/after-tess-and-roman-polanski-nastassia-kinski-trades-notoriety-for-l-a-propriety-vol-15-no-14/ "After 'tess' and Roman Polanski, Nastassia Kinski Trades Notoriety for L.a.

He offered her the starring role, which she accepted. Her father was [[Klaus Kinski]], a leading German actor, who had introduced her to films.

Because the role required having a local dialect, Polanski sent her to London for five months of study and to spend time in the Dorset countryside to get a flavor of the region.&lt;ref name=People/&gt; In the film, Kinski starred opposite [[Peter Firth]] and [[Leigh Lawson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/16/1376644998987/Polanski-directing-Peter--004.jpg?w=700&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=aee779bf01206a36dc861bb65dda38ce|title=Photo of Polanski directing Kinski and Firth|publisher=guim.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104141809/https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/16/1376644998987/Polanski-directing-Peter--004.jpg?w=700&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=aee779bf01206a36dc861bb65dda38ce|archivedate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=left|width=25em|bgcolor = mistyrose|quote=[Polanski] took a lot of time, two years, preparing me for that film.... He was strict with me, but in a good way.

''The Francis Ford Coppola Encyclopedia'', Scarecrow Press (2010) p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;}}
''Tess'' was shot in the north of France instead of Hardy's England and became the most expensive film made in France up to that time. Ultimately, it proved a financial success and was well received by both critics and the public. Polanski won France's César Awards for [[César Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[César Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and received his fourth Academy Award nomination (and his second nomination for Best Director). The film received three Oscars: best cinematography, best art direction, best costume design, and was nominated for best picture.

At the time, there were rumors that Polanski and Kinski became romantically involved, but she says the rumors are untrue; they were never lovers or had an affair.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11394696/Nastassja-Kinski-interview-Ive-had-such-low-self-esteem.html "Nastassja Kinski interview: 'I've had such low self-esteem'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619041655/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11394696/Nastassja-Kinski-interview-Ive-had-such-low-self-esteem.html |date=19 June 2016 }}, ''The Telegraph'', U.K., 6 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; She admits that "there was a flirtation.

=== 1980s ===
In 1981, Polanski directed and co-starred (as [[Mozart]]) in a stage production of [[Peter Shaffer]]'s play ''[[Amadeus]]'', first in Warsaw, then in Paris.&lt;ref name="contributions8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polanski On Polish Stage Amid Political Upheaval"/&gt; The play was again directed by Polanski, in Milan, in 1999.&lt;ref name="Roman Polanski-directed Amadeus Opens in Milan, Nov. 30 - Playbill.com"/&gt;

====''Pirates'' (1986)====
Nearly seven years passed before Polanski's next film, ''[[Pirates (1986 film)|Pirates]]'', a lavish period piece starring [[Walter Matthau]] as Captain Red, which the director intended as an homage to the beloved [[Errol Flynn]] swashbucklers of his childhood. Captain Red's henchman, Jean Baptiste, was played by Cris Campion. The film is about a rebellion the two led on a ship called the ''Neptune'', in the seventeenth century. The screenplay was written by Polanski, Gérard Brach, and John Brownjohn. The film was shot on location in Tunisia,&lt;ref name="publishing9"/&gt; using a full-sized pirate vessel constructed for the production. It was a financial and critical failure, recovering a small fraction of its production budget and garnering a single Academy Award nomination.&lt;ref name="publishing10"/&gt;

====''Frantic'' (1988)====
''[[Frantic (film)|Frantic]]'' (1988) was a [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] suspense-thriller starring [[Harrison Ford]]&lt;ref name="publishing11"/&gt; and the actress/model [[Emmanuelle Seigner]],&lt;ref name="publishing12"/&gt; who later became Polanski's wife. The film follows an ordinary tourist in Paris whose wife is kidnapped. He attempts, hopelessly, to go through the Byzantine bureaucratic channels to deal with her disappearance, but finally takes matters into his own hands.

=== 1990s ===
[[File:Roman Polanski Emmanuelle Seigner Cannes.jpg|thumb|Polanski with wife [[Emmanuelle Seigner]] at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]].]]
Polanski followed this with the dark psycho-sexual film ''[[Bitter Moon]]'' (1992), followed by a film of the acclaimed play ''[[Death and the Maiden (film)|Death and the Maiden]]'' (1994) starring [[Sigourney Weaver]].

In 1997, Polanski directed a stage version of his 1967 film ''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]'', which debuted in [[Vienna]]&lt;ref name="bartlomiej"/&gt; followed by successful runs in [[Stuttgart]], Hamburg, Berlin, and [[Budapest]]. On {{Nowrap|11 March}} 1998, Polanski was elected a member of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref name="Entertainment, Polanski joins French elite" /&gt;

====''The Ninth Gate'' (1999)====
''[[The Ninth Gate]]'' is a thriller based on the novel ''[[El Club Dumas]]'' by [[Arturo Perez-Reverte]] and starring [[Johnny Depp]]. The movie's plot is based on the idea that an ancient text called "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows", authored by Aristide Torchia along with Lucifer, is the key to raising Satan.&lt;ref name="publishing13"/&gt;

=== 2000s ===
[[File:Roman Polanski..jpg|thumb|left|upright|Polanski at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]] for ''The Pianist'']]

====''The Pianist'' (2002)====
In 2001, Polanski filmed ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'', an adaptation of the World War II [[The Pianist (memoir)|autobiography of the same name]] by [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] musician [[Władysław Szpilman]]. Szpilman's experiences as a persecuted Jew in Poland during World War II were reminiscent of those of Polanski and his family. While Szpilman and Polanski escaped the concentration camps, their families did not, eventually perishing.

When [[Warsaw, Poland]], was chosen for the 2002 premiere of ''The Pianist'', "the country exploded with pride." According to reports, numerous former communists came to the screening and "agreed that it was a fantastic film."&lt;ref name="worldcrunch" /&gt;

In May 2002, the film won the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' (Golden Palm) award at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]],&lt;ref name="cannes-2002.com" /&gt; as well as [[César Awards|Césars]] for [[César Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[Cesar Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and later the 2002 [[Academy Award for Best Director]]. Because Polanski would have been arrested in the United States, he did not attend the Academy Awards ceremony in Hollywood. After the announcement of the Best Director Award, Polanski received a standing ovation from most of those present in the theater. Actor [[Harrison Ford]] accepted the award for Polanski, and then presented the Oscar to him at the [[Deauville Film Festival]] five months later in a public ceremony.&lt;ref name="wlwt" /&gt; Polanski later received the [[Crystal Globe]] award for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema at the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] in 2004.

====''Oliver Twist''  (2005)====
''[[Oliver Twist (2005 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' is an adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]' [[Oliver Twist|novel]], written by ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]''{{'}}s [[Ronald Harwood]] and shot in [[Prague]].&lt;ref name="publishing14"/&gt; Polanski said in interviews that he made the film as something he could show his children, and that the life of the young scavenger mirrored his own life, fending for himself in World War II Poland.

====''The Ghost Writer'' (2010)====
''[[The Ghost Writer (film)|The Ghost Writer]]'', a thriller focusing on a ghostwriter working on the memoirs of a character based loosely on former British prime minister [[Tony Blair]], swept the [[European Film Awards]] in 2010, winning six awards, including best movie, director, actor and screenplay.&lt;ref name="Awards1" /&gt; When it premiered at the [[60th Berlin International Film Festival|60th Berlinale]] in February 2010, Polanski won a [[Silver Bear for Best Director]],&lt;ref name="historical"/&gt; and in February 2011, it won four [[César Awards]], France's version of the Academy Awards.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

The film is based on a novel by British writer [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]. Harris and Polanski had previously worked for many months on a film of Harris's earlier novel ''Pompeii'', a novel that was actually inspired by Polanski's ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Beard |first=Matthew |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/polanski-to-bring-bestseller-on-last-days-of-pompeii-to-the-big-screen-434816.html |title=Polanski to bring best-seller on last days of Pompeii to the big screen |work=The Independent |date= |accessdate=30 October 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924130551/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/polanski-to-bring-bestseller-on-last-days-of-pompeii-to-the-big-screen-434816.html |archivedate=24 September 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had completed a script for ''Pompeii'' and were nearing production when the film was cancelled due to a looming actors' strike in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/polanski-pulls-out-of-pompeii-2-1117971777/ |title=Polanski pulls out of 'Pompeii' |work=Variety |date=11 September 2007 |accessdate=30 October 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211033213/http://variety.com/2007/film/news/polanski-pulls-out-of-pompeii-2-1117971777/ |archivedate=11 December 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After that film fell apart, they moved on to Harris's novel, [[The Ghost (novel)|The Ghost]], and adapted it for the screen together.

The cast includes [[Ewan McGregor]] as the writer and [[Pierce Brosnan]] as former British Prime Minister Adam Lang. The film was shot on locations in Germany.&lt;ref name="studiobabelsberg" /&gt;

In the United States, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] included it in his top 10 pick for 2010, and states that "this movie is the work of a man who knows how to direct a thriller. Smooth, calm, confident, it builds suspense instead of depending on shock and action."&lt;ref name="firstshowing" /&gt; Co-star Ewan McGregor agrees, saying about Polanski that "he's a legend... I've never examined a director and the way that they work, so much before. He's brilliant, just brilliant, and absolutely warrants his reputation as a great director."&lt;ref name="articleslash" /&gt;

====''Carnage'' (2011)====
Polanski shot ''[[Carnage (2011 film)|Carnage]]'' in February/March 2011. The film is a screen version of [[Yasmina Reza]]'s play ''[[God of Carnage]]'', a comedy about two couples who meet after their children get in a fight at school, and how their initially civilized conversation devolves into chaos. It stars [[Kate Winslet]], [[Jodie Foster]], [[Christoph Waltz]] and [[John C. Reilly]]. Though set in New York, it was shot in Paris.&lt;ref name="dailymail" /&gt; The film had its world premiere on 9 September 2011 at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and was released in the United States by [[Sony Pictures Classics]] on 16 December 2011.

Co-stars Jodie Foster and Kate Winslet commented about Polanski's directing style. According to Foster, "He has a very, very definitive style about how he likes it done. He decides everything. He decided every lens. Every prop. Everything. It's all him."&lt;ref name="hollywoodchicago" /&gt; Winslet adds that "Roman is one of the most extraordinary men I've ever met. The guy is 77 years old. He has an effervescent quality to him. He's very joyful about his work, which is infectious. He likes to have a small crew, to the point that, when I walked on the set, my thought was, 'My God, this is it?'"&lt;ref name="inquirer" /&gt; Also noting that style of directing, [[New York Film Festival]] director [[Richard Pena]], during the American premiere of the film, called Polanski "a poet of small spaces... in just a couple of rooms he can conjure up an entire world, an entire society."&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt;

Polanski makes an uncredited cameo appearance as a neighbor.

====''Venus in Fur'' (2013)====
Polanski's French-language adaptation of the award-winning play ''[[Venus in Fur (film)|Venus in Fur]]'', stars his wife [[Emmanuelle Seigner]] and [[Mathieu Amalric]].

====''Based on a True Story''  (2017)====
Polanski's ''[[Based on a True Story (film)|Based on a True Story]]'' is an adaptation of the French novel by bestselling author Delphine de Vignan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/19/roman-polanski-and-olivier-assayas-join-forces-on-new-film|title=Roman Polanski and Olivier Assayas join forces on new film|first=Henry|last=Barnes|date=19 July 2016|work=The Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719192151/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/19/roman-polanski-and-olivier-assayas-join-forces-on-new-film|archivedate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film  follows a writer ([[Emmanuelle Seigner]]) struggling to complete a new novel, while followed by an obsessed fan ([[Eva Green]]).

====''J'accuse'' (2019)====
Polanski will next direct ''J'accuse'', a film about the notorious [[Dreyfus affair]] in the 19th century, starring [[Jean Dujardin]] as French officer [[Georges Picquart]]. The film tells the true story of Picquart's struggle from 1896-1906 to expose the truth about the doctored evidence that got Alfred Dreyfus, one of the few Jewish members of the French Army's general staff, wrongly convicted of passing military secrets to the [[German Empire]] and sent to [[Devil's Island]]. The film is written by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], who is working with Polanski for the third time.&lt;ref name="Roman Polanski to Direct Dreyfus Affair Drama 'D'"/&gt; It is set to go into production in the fall of 2018, co-starring [[Louis Garrel]] as Dreyfus, [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Olivier Gourmet]] and Polanski's wife [[Emmanuelle Seigner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roman-polanskis-jaccuse-is-his-first-film-metoo-era-1147851|title=Roman Polanski's 'J'Accuse' Is Filmmaker's First in the Post-#MeToo Era|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be produced by Alain Goldman's Legende Films and distributed by [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allocine.fr/article/fichearticle_gen_carticle=18675311.html|title=J’accuse : Jean Dujardin chez Roman Polanski pour son film sur l'affaire Dreyfus|first=|last=AlloCine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although set in Paris, the film was first scheduled to shoot in Warsaw in 2014, for economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/11/Artykul/174633,Polanski-wants-to-make-next-movie-in-Poland|title=Polanski wants to make next movie in Poland|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123133640/http://www.thenews.pl/1/11/Artykul/174633,Polanski-wants-to-make-next-movie-in-Poland|archivedate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, production was postponed after Polanski moved to Poland for filming and the U.S. Government filed extradition papers. The Polish government eventually rejected them, by which time new French film tax credits had been introduced, allowing the film to shoot on location in Paris. It was budgeted at 60 million euros and was again set to start production in July 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/culture-loisirs/polanski-tournera-dreyfus-en-france-09-02-2016-5527437.php#xtref=https://www.google.com|title=Polanski tournera " Dreyfus " en France|date=24 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however its production was postponed as Polanski waited on the availability of a star, whose name was not announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/11/Artykul/246505,Polanski-delays-filming-of-spy-thriller|title=Polański delays filming of spy thriller|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405080325/http://www.thenews.pl/1/11/Artykul/246505,Polanski-delays-filming-of-spy-thriller|archivedate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 interview Polanski discussed the difficulty of the project:
{{quote|The problem of the film is the combination of casting and financing, it's an expensive film and films of this scale are only made with a bankable star, as they say vulgarly, and the stars capable of satisfying the financial requirement I do not necessarily see in the role of Picquart, who is our main character. Apart from that, there are about fifty important roles. They should all speak with the same accent in English, otherwise it would be appalling. It is necessary so that the film can be sold around the world. To unlock the financial means to produce such a project is impossible if you shoot in French."&lt;ref&gt;Translated from: Gauthier Jurgensen, "[http://www.allocine.fr/article/fichearticle_gen_carticle=18668068.html Roman Polanski tournera un documentaire sur son enfance et s’exprime sur le projet Dreyfus]", ''Allocie'', October 18, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; }}

== Marriages and relationships ==
=== Barbara Kwiatkowska-Lass ===
Polanski's first wife, [[Barbara Kwiatkowska-Lass|Barbara Lass]] (née Kwiatkowska),&lt;ref name="RPinterviewsxv" /&gt; was a Polish actress who also starred in Polanski's 1959 ''When Angels Fall''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated" /&gt; The couple were married in 1959 and divorced in 1961.&lt;!-- or 1962 per Bugliosi--&gt;&lt;ref name="RPinterviewsxv" /&gt;

=== Sharon Tate ===
[[File:Sharon Tate in Eye of the Devil trailer 2.jpg|thumb|left|Sharon Tate in the trailer for the film ''[[Eye of the Devil]]''.]]
Polanski met rising actress [[Sharon Tate]] while filming ''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]'', and during the production, the two of them began dating.&lt;ref name="Bugliosip27" /&gt; On {{Nowrap|20 January}} 1968, Polanski married Tate in London.&lt;ref name="sknew" /&gt;

In August 1969, while Polanski was in Europe working on a film, Tate was [[Tate murders|murdered]] along with four of their friends at their home in Los Angeles by members of [[Charles Manson]]'s 'family,' a group of young, mostly female followers. Tate was pregnant at the time of her murder.

Manson, along with members of his 'family', was arrested in late 1969, and eventually tried and found guilty in 1971 of 27 counts, including first-degree murder, an event now called the Manson murders. Because at the time it was one of the most "horrific crimes in modern history," the crime and trial of Manson and his followers became a media sensation, leading to movies, documentaries and bestselling books.&lt;ref name="Statman"/&gt;

Polanski has said that his absence on the night of the murders is the greatest regret of his life.&lt;ref name="Roman Polanski: The artful dodger" /&gt; In his autobiography, he wrote, "Sharon's death is the only watershed in my life that really matters", and commented that her murder changed his personality from a "boundless, untroubled sea of expectations and optimism" to one of "ingrained pessimism&amp;nbsp;... eternal dissatisfaction with life".&lt;ref name="polanski7" /&gt; In his autobiography, Polanski described his brief time with Tate as the best years of his life.

Polanski was also left with a very negative impression of the press, which he felt was interested in sensationalizing the lives of the victims, and indirectly himself, to attract readers. He was shocked by the lack of sympathy expressed in various news stories:

{{quote
| I had long known that it was impossible for a journalist to convey 100 percent of the truth, but I didn't realize to what extent the truth is distorted, both by the intentions of the journalist and by neglect. I don't mean just the interpretations of what happened; I also mean the facts. The reporting about Sharon and the murders was virtually criminal. Reading the papers, I could not believe my eyes. I could not believe my eyes! They blamed the victims for their own murders. I really despise the press. I didn't always. The press made me despise it.&lt;ref name="playboy" /&gt;
}}

Among the media-generated [[sensationalism]] were rumors that claimed Tate and her visitors were taking drugs, despite the coroner's announcing that no traces of drugs or nicotine were found after Tate's autopsy.&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt; For years afterward, notes Sandford, "reporters openly speculated about the Polanskis' home life" and their personalities in order to create more media gossip about the private lives of Hollywood celebrities.&lt;ref name="RPinterviewsxv" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

=== Emmanuelle Seigner ===
In 1989, Polanski married French actress [[Emmanuelle Seigner]], who is 33 years younger than he. They have two children, daughter [[Morgane Polanski|Morgane]] and son Elvis.&lt;ref name="WTCIFTC" /&gt; Polanski and his children speak Polish at home.&lt;ref name="tvn24" /&gt;

== Legal history ==

=== Sexual abuse case ===
{{main article|Roman Polanski sexual abuse case}}
[[File:Mug shot of Roman Polanski.png|thumb|left|200px|Mugshot of Polanski following his 1977 arrest]]
On 11 March 1977, three years after making ''Chinatown,'' Polanski was arrested at Jack Nicholson's home for the [[Roman Polanski sexual abuse case|sexual assault]] of 13-year-old Samantha Gailey, who was modeling for Polanski during a ''Vogue'' magazine photo shoot around the pool. Polanski was indicted on six counts of criminal behavior, including rape.&lt;ref name="WTCIFTC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2009-09-28"/&gt; At his arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to all charges. Many executives in Hollywood came to his defense.&lt;ref name="Polanski Pleads Not Guilty in Drug-Rape Case"/&gt; Gailey's attorney next arranged a [[plea bargain]] in which five of the six charges would be dismissed, and Polanski accepted.&lt;ref name="Romney2008-10-05"/&gt;

At the time of the incident, Nicholson was out of town making a film, but his steady girlfriend, actress [[Anjelica Huston]], had dropped by unannounced to pick up some items. She heard Polanski in the other room say "We'll be right out."&lt;ref name=Huston/&gt; Polanski then came out with Gailey and he introduced her to Huston, and they chatted about Nicholson's two large dogs which were sitting nearby. Huston recalled Gailey was wearing platform heels and appeared quite tall.&lt;ref name=Huston/&gt;

After a brief conversation, Polanski had packed up his camera gear and Huston saw them drive off in his car. Huston told police the next day, after Polanski was arrested, that she "had witnessed nothing untoward" and never saw them together in the other room.&lt;ref name=Huston&gt;Huston, Anjelica. ''Watch Me'', Simon and Schuster (2014) e-book&lt;/ref&gt; Gailey learned afterwards that Huston had recently broken up with Nicholson, but stopped by to pick up some belongings.&lt;ref&gt;Geimer, Samantha. ''The Girl: A Life in the Shadow of Roman Polanski'', Simon and Schuster (2013) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman Polański.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Polanski in 2007]]
As a result of the plea bargain, Polanski pleaded guilty to the charge of "unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor,"&lt;ref name="onecle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer2009-09-28"/&gt; and was ordered to undergo 90 days of psychiatric evaluation at [[California Institution for Men]] at Chino.&lt;ref name="Court Orders Polanski Kept in Jail"/&gt; Upon release from prison after 42 days, Polanski agreed to the plea bargain, his penalty to be time served along with [[probation]]. However, he learned afterward that the judge, [[Laurence J. Rittenband]], had told some friends that he was going to disregard the plea bargain and sentence Polanski to 50 years in prison:&lt;ref name="Palmer2009-09-28"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bostonglobe"/&gt; "I'll see this man never gets out of jail," he told Polanski's friend, screenwriter [[Howard E. Koch]].&lt;ref name=Douglas&gt;Douglas, Edward. ''Jack: The Great Seducer'', Harper Collins (2004) p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Gailey's attorney confirmed the judge changed his mind after he personally met with the judge in his chambers:
{{quote|He was going to sentence Polanski, rather than to time served, to fifty years. What the judge did was outrageous. We had agreed to a plea bargain and the judge had approved it.&lt;ref name=Douglas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"How Roman Polanski Fled Country", ''Globe'' UK, March 18, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Polanski was told by his attorney that "the judge could no longer be trusted..." and that the judge's representations were "worthless".&lt;ref name="documentary2"/&gt; Polanski decided not to appear at his sentencing. He told his friend, director [[Dino De Laurentis]], "I've made up my mind. I'm getting out of here."&lt;ref name=Douglas/&gt; On the day before sentencing in 1978, Polanski left the country on a flight to [[London]], where he had a home. One day later, he left for France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1217378/French-government-drops-support-director-Roman-Polanski-faces-extradition-U-S.html|title=French government drops support for director Roman Polanski as LA police warn he could get 20 years for rape|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt; As a French [[Citizenship|citizen]], he has been protected from extradition and has lived mostly in France since then.&lt;ref name="Dyer2009-09-29"/&gt; However, since he fled the United States before final sentencing, the charges are still pending.

In 1988, Gailey sued Polanski. Among other things, the suit alleged sexual assault, [[false imprisonment]], seduction of a minor, and [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]]. In 1993, Polanski agreed to settle with his victim. In August 1996, Polanski still owed her $604,416; court filings confirm that the settlement was completed by 1997 via a confidential financial arrangement.&lt;ref name="Ryan2009-10-03"/&gt; The victim, now married and going by the name Samantha Geimer, stated in a 2003 interview with [[Larry King]] that the police and media had been slow at the time of the assault to believe her account, which she attributed to the social climate of the era.&lt;ref name="2003 Larry King Transcript"/&gt; In 2008, she stated, "I don't wish for him to be held to further punishment or consequences."&lt;ref name="Ryan2009-10-03"/&gt; 

On 26 September 2009, Polanski was arrested while in Switzerland at the request of United States authorities.&lt;ref name="AFP2009-09-27"/&gt; The arrest brought renewed attention to the case and stirred controversy, particularly in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name="bostonglobe"/&gt; Polanski was defended by many prominent individuals, including Hollywood celebrities and European artists and politicians, who called for his release.&lt;ref name="outcry"/&gt; American public opinion was reported to run against him, however,&lt;ref name="reaction"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; and polls in France and Poland showed that strong majorities favored his [[extradition]] to the United States.&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inpoland"/&gt;

Polanski was jailed near [[Zürich]] for two months, then put under [[house arrest]] at his home in [[Gstaad]] while awaiting decision of appeals fighting extradition.&lt;ref name="Roman Polanski begins house arrest at his Swiss chalet"/&gt; On 12 July 2010, the Swiss rejected the United States' request, declared Polanski a "free man" and released him from custody.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; He remains the subject of an [[Interpol notice|Interpol red notice]] issued in 2005 at the request of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.interpol.int/Wanted-Persons/(wanted_id)/2005-47995 |title=Wanted Persons: Polanski, Roman Raymond |author=Staff |year=2005 |publisher=[[Interpol]] |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a television interview on 10 March 2011, Geimer blamed the media, reporters, the court, and the judge for having caused "way more damage to me and my family than anything Roman Polanski has ever done", and opined that the judge was using her and Polanski for the media exposure.&lt;ref name="abcnews"/&gt;

In January 2014, newly uncovered emails from 2008 by a Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge, Larry P. Fidler, indicated that if Polanski returned to the United States for a hearing, the conduct of the judge who had originally presided over the case, Laurence A.

On 30 October 2015, Polish judge Dariusz Mazur denied a request by the United States to extradite Polanski (a dual French-Polish citizen) for a full trial, claiming that it would be "obviously unlawful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Michal|last1=Kolanko |first2=Michael|last2=Cieply|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/31/world/europe/roman-polanski-poland-extradiction.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0 | title=Polish Court Turns Down U.S. Request for Roman Polanski's Extradition | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | publisher=New York Times Conmpany|location=new York City|date=30 October 2015 | accessdate=30 October 2015| lastauthoramp=yes | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205214340/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/31/world/europe/roman-polanski-poland-extradiction.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0 | archivedate=5 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kraków prosecutor's office declined to challenge the court's ruling, agreeing that Polanski had served his punishment and did not need to face a U.S. court again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joanna|last=Berendt| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/roman-polanski-will-not-be-extradited-to-u-s-poland-says/?ref=topics | title=Roman Polanski Will Not Be Extradited to U.S., Poland Says | publisher=New York Times | date=27 November 2015 | accessdate=30 December 2016 | lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Poland's national justice ministry took up the appeal, arguing that sexual abuse of minors should be prosecuted regardless of the suspect's accomplishments or the length of time since the suspected crime took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/world/europe/roman-polanski-extradition-poland.html?_r=0 | title=Roman Polanski Extradition Request Rejected by Poland's Supreme Court | publisher=New York Times | date=6 December 2016 | accessdate=30 December 2016 | author1=JOANNA BERENDT | lastauthoramp=yes | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161208121854/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/world/europe/roman-polanski-extradition-poland.html?_r=0 | archivedate=8 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a December 2016 decision, the Supreme Court of Poland dismissed the government's appeal, holding that the prosecutor general had failed to prove misconduct or flagrant legal error on the part of the lower court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sn.pl/aktualnosci/SitePages/Komunikaty_o_sprawach.aspx?ItemID=138&amp;ListName=Komunikaty_o_sprawach | title=''Sąd Najwyższy oddalił kasację Prokuratora Generalnego w sprawie dopuszczalności ekstradycji Romana Polańskiego'' IV KK 192/16 (''in Polish'') | publisher=Supreme Court of the Republic of Poland | date=6 December 2016 | accessdate=30 December 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231170150/http://www.sn.pl/aktualnosci/SitePages/Komunikaty_o_sprawach.aspx?ItemID=138&amp;ListName=Komunikaty_o_sprawach | archivedate=31 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May 2018 Roman Polanski was removed from the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], with the decision referencing the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43994591|title=Oscars academy expels Cosby and Polanski|website=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|location=London, England|date=3 May 2018|accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Documentary films====
In 2008, the documentary film by Marina Zenovich, ''[[Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired]]'', was released in Europe and the United States where it won numerous awards.&lt;ref name="nytimes8" /&gt; The film focuses on the judge in the case and the possible reasons why he changed his mind. It includes interviews with people involved in the case, including the victim, Geimer, and the prosecutor, Roger Gunson. Geimer said that the judge "didn't care what happened" to her or Polanski, but "was orchestrating some little show,"&lt;ref name="documentary2" /&gt; while Gunson added, "I'm not surprised that Polanski left under those circumstances,&amp;nbsp;... it was going to be a real circus."&lt;ref name="documentary2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Romney2008-10-05"/&gt;

Former Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Wells, whose statements were the most damning against Polanski, and who said he advised the judge to imprison Polanski, admitted that he lied about those statements, and said that to the press to "play up" his own role.&lt;ref name="Former DA admits he lied in 'Roman Polanski: Wanted And Desired' film" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ex-prosecutor admits he lied about Polanski case" /&gt;

In December 2009, a California appellate court discussed the film's allegations as it denied Polanski's request to have the case dismissed. While saying it was "deeply concerned" by the allegations, and that the allegations were "in many cases supported by considerable evidence," it also found that "(e)ven in light of our fundamental concern about the misconduct&amp;nbsp;... flight was not Polanski's only option. It was not even his best option." It said dismissal of the case, which would erase Polanski's guilty plea, would not be an "appropriate result," and that he still had other legal options.&lt;ref name="bostonglobe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsnews" /&gt;

In September 2011, the documentary film ''[[Roman Polanski: A Film Memoir]]'' had its world premiere in [[Zürich, Switzerland]]. During an interview in the film, he offers his apology to Geimer: "She is a double victim: My victim, and a victim of the press."&lt;ref name="CNN-apology" /&gt; On this occasion, he collected the lifetime achievement award he was to have received at the time of his arrest two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Angelique|last=Chrisafis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/28/roman-polanski-zurich-film-festival|title=Roman Polanski gets Zürich film festival award after two-year wait|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=27 February 2011|accessdate=20 November 2018|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917185248/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/28/roman-polanski-zurich-film-festival |archivedate=17 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Vanity Fair'' libel case ===
In 2004, Polanski sued ''[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine in London for libel. A 2002 article in the magazine claimed that Polanski promised he would "make another Sharon Tate out of you" in an attempt to seduce a Scandinavian model while he was travelling to Tate's funeral. He received supporting testimony from Mia Farrow, and ''Vanity Fair'' "was unable to prove that the incident occurred." Polanski was awarded [[pound sterling|£]]50,000 in [[damages]] plus some of his [[legal costs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sarah|last=Lyall|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=F30715F93F5B0C708EDDAE0894DD404482| title=Polanski Wins Vanity Fair Libel Suit|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=23 July 2005|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Matan Uziel libel case ===
In December 2017, Polanski filed a [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]] 1.5 million suit in [[Herzliya]] Magistrates' Court against Israeli journalist and filmmaker Matan Uziel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Amy|last=Spiro|
url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Roman-Polanski-files-NIS-15m-libel-suit-against-Israeli-man-517205| title=Roman Polanski Files Nis 1.5m. Libel Suit Against Israeli Man|newspaper=[[Jerusalem Post]]|publisher=The Jerusalem Post Group|location=Jerusalem|date=6 December 2017|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polanski maintained that Uziel, through his website, www.imetpolanski.com, falsely reported that five women had come forward to accuse him of raping them. Polanski was suing for libel and defamation of character. Herzliya Magistrates' Court rejected Polanski's request to be exempt from appearing in court after filing the libel suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.israelhayom.com/2018/01/24/director-roman-polanski-ordered-to-testify-in-suit-against-israeli-blogger/| title=Director Roman Polanski ordered to testify in suit against Israeli blogger| accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Polanski gave various reasons for his inability to appear, the presiding judge, Gilad Hess, dismissed these one by one and ordered Polanski to pay Uziel NIS 10,000 in costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Amy|last=Spiro| url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Herzliya-court-Roman-Polanski-must-appear-in-person-at-trial-539688| title=Herzliya Court: Roman Polanski Must Appear In Person At Trial|newspaper=[[Jerusalem Post]]|publisher=The Jerusalem Post Group|location=Jerusalem|date=24 January 2018| accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018, it was published that Polanski decided to drop the lawsuit, and was ordered by the court to pay Uziel NIS 30,000 (USD 8,000) for court costs. The court accepted Uziel's request that the suit not be dropped, but rather that it be rejected, making Polanski unable to sue Uziel again over the same issue in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-polanski-ordered-to-pay-court-costs-to-israeli-journalist-after-pulling-libel-suit-1.6682184|title=Judge orders Roman Polanski to pay court costs to Israeli journalist after withdrawing libel suit|work=haaretz.com|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

=== Additional allegations, 2010 onwards ===
In 2010, British actress [[Charlotte Lewis]] said that Polanski had "forced himself" on her while she was auditioning for a role in Paris in 1983, when she was 16.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|first=Gwilym|last=Mumford|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/23/roman-polanski-marianne-barnard-allegations|title=Roman Polanski accused of sexually assaulting 10-year-old girl in 1975|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=23 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104155950/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/23/roman-polanski-marianne-barnard-allegations|archivedate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, however, Lewis gave a very different account of events in an interview with the UK's ''[[News of the World]]'', which was unearthed by the French daily ''[[Libération]]''. In that interview, Lewis asserted that she actually had a six-month tryst with Polanski when she was 17: "I knew that Roman had done something bad in the United States, but I wanted to be his mistress," Lewis said, according to ''Liberation''. "I wanted him probably more than he wanted me." In addition, Lewis never mentioned any sexual abuse, and she said that their relationship ended when Polanski introduced her to [[Warren Beatty]], and she claimed that they soon began an affair. Furthermore, she was cast in Polanski's 1986 film ''[[Pirates (1986 film)|Pirates]]'', appeared at the Cannes film festival on his arm years after the alleged incident, and in an interview the year of the film's release, Lewis stated, "I'd love to have had a romantic relationship with [Polanski], and a physical one. You can't help falling in love with him. But he didn't want me that way."&lt;ref name="Pape_5/17/2010"&gt;{{cite web |first=Eric| last=Pape |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/05/17/is-polanskis-new-accuser-lying | title=Roman Polanski Accuser, Charlotte Lewis, Lying? | website=[[The Daily Beast]] | publisher=IAC/InteractiveCorp| location=New York City| date=17 May 2010 | accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, a woman named Renate Langer interviewed by Swiss police said Polanski raped her in [[Gstaad]] when she was 15, in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/03/roman-polanski-under-investigation-by-swiss-police-over-new-allegations|title=Roman Polanski under investigation by Swiss police over new rape allegations|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=3 October 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=New York City|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111182001/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/03/roman-polanski-under-investigation-by-swiss-police-over-new-allegations|archivedate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, Marianne Barnard accused Polanski of having assaulted her in 1975, when she was 10 years old.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Pamela Jennings''' (1964–2012), known as '''Soho Pam''', was a homeless English woman who became well known in [[Soho]], London where she begged. She was much loved for her affectionate, polite manner and was the subject of artists and authors.

==Early life==
She was born in [[Carshalton]], [[Surrey]], on 19 April 1964.&lt;ref name=T&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9819550/Pamela-Jennings.html |date=22 January 2013 |journal=[[Daily Telegraph]] |title=Pamela Jennings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her siblings Michael and Susan, said that she was enthusiastic but accident-prone.&lt;ref name=O&gt;{{citation |author=Guy Rundle |journal=[[The Observer]] |date=10 February 2013 |title=Pamela Jennings obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/10/pamela-jennings-obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She worked as a [[carer]], [[shopgirl]] and played the [[glockenspiel|bell lyre]].&lt;ref name=O/&gt; She had mental health problems and, when her mother died in 1998, she became [[homelessness|homeless]] and estranged from her remaining family.&lt;ref name=O/&gt;

==Homeless==
{{quote box|width=35%|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|fontsize=90%|quote=Pam, the Fag{{efn|[[Wiktionary:fag#Etymology 1|Fag]]'' is British slang for "cigarette".}} Lady, is one of the characters of [[Old Compton Street]]. A small, squat woman in her late fifties with closely cropped hair and "barn owl" glasses. Pam usually starts begging at midday and finishes once she's collected enough money for a packet of cigarettes and a bed for the night...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[she gives the author an unexpected present]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Do you like it?  Do you like it?" she cries, like a kid at Christmas.  "I saved up for it!"&lt;br&gt;"But really, you shouldn't have."&lt;br&gt;"Well, we gotta look out for each other on this street", she reminds me, wagging her finger. Then she gives me a loving smile.  "Now, can I have two pounds, please?"|source=''Dirty White Boy: Tales of Soho'' by [[Clayton Littlewood]] (2008)&lt;ref name=DWB&gt;{{citation |title=Dirty White Boy: Tales of Soho |author=[[Clayton Littlewood]] |publisher=[[Cleis Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=9781573443302 |pages=239–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; |title=An Early Christmas Present}}
As a homeless person, she needed £7 every day to pay for a bed in the hostel in [[Pimlico]] which she used.&lt;ref name=O/&gt; To finance this and her habits of gambling and smoking, she regularly begged in the nearby district of Soho where she became familiar to the bohemian community in drinking establishments such as the [[The French House, Soho|French House]].&lt;ref name=O/&gt;

She was generally welcomed for her cheerful and affectionate nature, thanking benefactors with hugs and soft salutations such as "cuddle cuddle" and "love you".&lt;ref name=T/&gt;&lt;ref name=NS&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk-politics/2013/01/penniless-exiles-soho |journal=[[New Statesman]] |title=The penniless exiles of Soho |author=Yo Zushi |date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One exception was at the famous [[Coach and Horses, Soho|Coach and Horses]] where the landlord, Norman Balon, would chase her away. When he retired in 2006, she said, "I’ll miss looking in the window to check whether he's in or not".&lt;ref name=TO&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/bars-and-pubs/good-bye-norman-balon |journal=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |author=Andrew Humphreys |date=31 May 2006 |title=Good bye Norman Balon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new landlord, Alistair Choat, was more friendly, allowing her two visits per day and inviting her to his wedding.&lt;ref name=O/&gt; He said that her manner was especially polite and engaging, "It was her very gentle approach, she would never demand anything and she would just ask sweetly. She had this rocking motion, where she would rock on her feet and then chat, and she would always be counting the money she had in her hand, over and over and over. Most importantly, she was quite petite, she was quite childlike, but she was always very polite, so she just ingratiated people."&lt;ref name=WEE&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.westendextra.com/news/2013/jan/tributes-pam-jennings-sweet-soul-soho-who-inspired-areas-artists-and-writers |journal=[[West End Extra]] |date=25 January 2013 |author=William McLennan |title=Tributes to Pam Jennings, the 'sweet soul of Soho' who inspired area's artists and writers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of an SS Totenkopf Battalion and is accused of having been a guard in three [[concentration camp]]s in [[Germany]], [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]]. Szehinskyj emigrated to the United States after the war, but was named as a war criminal by the United States Department of Justice in 2000, subsequently had his citizenship revoked, and is facing attempts to deport him from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-08-27/news/41459421_1_nazi-war-crimes-theodor-szehinskyj-accused-nazi |title=Accused Nazi still has Chesco address |first=Aubrey |last=Whelan |date=August 27, 2013 |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is on the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]'s [[List of Most Wanted Nazi War Criminals according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center|list of most wanted Nazi war criminals]].

'''Ivan "Vane" Stefan Ivanović''' (9 June 1913 – 4 April 1999) was a Yugoslav-British [[sportsperson|athlete]], [[shipowner]], political activist, diplomat, writer and philanthropist. One of the founders of the [[European Movement]] and the consul general of [[Monaco]] in London, he devoted most of his life to the idea of [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] unity.

==Background==
Vane (pronounced "Vahnay") Ivanović (pronounced "Ivanovich") was born in 1913 in [[Osijek]], [[Austria-Hungary]] to a Jewish Croat father and a Serb mother. His father, [[Ivan Rikard Ivanović]], was originally born with the surname Kraus but like so many Jewish families feeling persecuted by the Austro-Hungarian Empire, they changed their name and converted to [[Catholic]]ism. Ivan Rikard subsequently became a representative in Croatia's [[Sabor]] (Assembly). His mother, Milica (b. 26 February 1888) was a sister of [[Dušan Popović (1877–1958)|Dušan Popović]], a leading Serb politician in the ruling [[Croat-Serb Coalition]]. [[Svetozar Pribićević]], the other leading Serb in the Coalition, was the best man at Rikard and Milica's wedding in July 1912, while [[Ivan Lorković]], member of Ivan Rikard Ivanović's party and the leading Croat in the Coalition, was Ivanović's godfather. Ivanović had a younger brother, Vladimir, born 1917, and a younger sister, [[Daška Ivanović]] (pronounced "Dashka"), born in 1915.

Whereas his family background clearly contributed to the development of Ivanović's strong Yugoslav identity, his life in Britain and the education he received there at [[Westminster School]] and at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]] (where he read Economics) made him a staunch [[Anglophile]]. A rather dandyish figure who often supported an impressive cigar, Ivanović appeared to [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] an English gentleman who spoke a slightly archaic [[Croatian language|Croat]]; to the British he was considered a no less exotic 'Eastern gentleman'. Despite spending much time in Britain, Ivanović never sought to be naturalised, although he did not hold a Yugoslav passport either. He was also the proud owner of two [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] dogs. In 1930, Ivanović, later a member of the British Dalmatian Club, took a pair to Dalmatia -- where the breed originated from -- as a present for his stepfather.

==Sports==
A well-known athlete, Ivanović was a member of the [[Yugoslavia at the 1936 Summer Olympics|Yugoslav team]] at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Berlin]], running the 110-metre and [[Athletics at the 1936 Summer Olympics – Men's 400 metres hurdles|400-metre hurdles]]. He was the undisputed Yugoslav champion in both disciplines throughout the 1930s. At the event, he was among the number of athletes who refused to give [[Hitler]] the [[Nazi salute]].&lt;ref name="kingston"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingston.ac.uk/news/article/627/23-jul-2012-memorabilia-from-hitlers-olympics-kept-by-the-late-vane-ivanovic-on-display-at-kingston-university/|title=Memorabilia from Hitler's Olympics - kept by the late Vane Ivanovic - on display at Kingston University archives - News - Kingston University London|publisher=kingston.ac.uk|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 110m he reached the semi-finals in Berlin and in 400m hurdles he held the Yugoslav record for 17 years, from 1936 until 1953.

Ivanović maintained his love of sport throughout his life. His only concession to age (in his 80s) was to cut back his runs around Hyde Park to alternate days. He was also an avid [[scuba diver]]. One of the pioneers of the sport, he contributed greatly to its development in Europe and the [[Bahamas]]. He wrote a number of books on [[spearfishing]], of which one in particular, "Modern Spearfishing" (1974), remains a classic among diving enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="vintagedoublehose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vintagedoublehose.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=4198|title=Vintage Double Hose &amp;bull; View topic - Vane Ivanovic--His spearfishing books &amp;amp; life|publisher=vintagedoublehose.com|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in shipping==
After his parents' divorce in the early 1920s, Ivanović's mother remarried Božidar "Božo" Banac (pronounced "Borgia Banatz") in London on 9 November 1921. Banac lived in London where he ran a shipping business, Jugoslovenski Lloyd, Ltd., (Yugoslav Lloyd), then Yugoslavia's largest shipping company which operated vessels in the Atlantic, Adriatic and Mediterranean waters. Ivanović and his siblings then moved in with their new stepfather. Banac, a native of [[Dubrovnik]] and a believer in Yugoslav unity, had helped the creation and activities of the [[Yugoslav Committee]], a group of [[Habsburg]] Croat, [[Slovenes|Slovene]] and Serb politicians and intellectuals also based in London. In 1937 he was made director of his stepfather's company.

==World War II==
In 1914, Banac had placed his ships at the disposal of the British war effort.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Voyage to Gallipoli: |author=Plowman, P.|date=2013|publisher=Rosenberg Publishing Pty, Limited|isbn=9781922013903|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pZVCAQAAQBAJ|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family did the same at the outbreak of [[World War II]], when Ivanović, acting on behalf of his then ailing stepfather, placed 10 out of the 22 steamers owned by Yugoslav Lloyd in the service of the [[Ministry of War Transport]].&lt;ref name="gold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.gold.ac.uk/4800/|title=Yugoslav Anti-Axis Resistance, 1939-1941: The Case of Vane Ivanovic - Goldsmiths Research Online|publisher=research.gold.ac.uk|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Banac and Ivanović were the first shipowners from a neutral country to join the Allies.

After the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] by [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and their external and internal allies in April 1941, Ivanović organized other Yugoslav shipowners into the "Yugoslav Shipping Committee". Their aim was to prevent the capture of the Yugoslav mercantile fleet, still in neutral waters, by the [[Nazis]].

In the summer of 1943, Ivanović joined the Yugoslav section of the [[Political Warfare Executive]] (PWE) the propaganda arm of Britain's [[Special Operations Executive]].&lt;ref name="aim25"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cats/44/19735.htm|title=AIM25 text-only browsing: Kingston University: Ivanovic, Vane: The Vane Ivanovic Library|publisher=aim25.ac.uk|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Parachutes, Patriots and Partisans: The Special Operations Executive and Yugoslavia, 1941-1945|author=Williams, H.|date=2003|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299194949|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWWJm6URz34C|page=269|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though most of the fleet of Yugoslav Lloyd had either been sunk or captured by this point, there were still enough independently owned Yugoslavian ships participating in the Allied effort under flags of convenience.

In his memoirs, Ivanović explained why he did not return to his occupied country to join [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s or [[Draža Mihailović]]'s resistance movements: "I had no desire to forget the enemy and engage in a fratricidal war among my fellow countrymen, especially as I did not wholly agree with either side." He spent the rest of the war between London, [[Bari]] and [[Cairo]] and was eventually demobilized as a Major in the [[British army]]. Because of the [[Communist]] seizure of power in Yugoslavia, he remained in Britain as a [[political refugee]]. In April 1945, Bozidar "Bozo" Banac, Ivanović's stepfather died.

==Post-war years==
After the war, and despite the fact that most of his pre-war fleet had been either destroyed or nationalized by the new Yugoslav authorities, Ivanović resumed a successful career in shipping.

In February 1949 Ivanović's biological father died in [[Genoa]]-Quinto, Italy. That same year his sister was remarried to Lt. Col. [[Neil McLean (politician)|Neil McLean]], DSO, who had also been a member of [[Special Operations Executive]] during the war. That same year Ivanović founded the "Benevolent Association of Free Citizens of Yugoslavia", a charity financed mainly by himself. Through this organization and as a private individual he helped innumerable refugees, students, artists and [[political dissidents]] escape Tito's dictatorship.&lt;ref name="pescanik"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pescanik.net/2009/04/mini-manjina-vane-ivanovic/|title=Mini manjina &amp;#8211; Vane Ivanović &amp;#124; Peščanik|publisher=pescanik.net|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]] years, along with other like-minded Yugoslavs, Ivanović organized many discussions about the fate of his homeland, which led to the two-volume collection "A Democratic Alternative", published in 1963, which warned that the establishment of independent states in the [[Balkans]] would spawn 'fatal conflicts'.&lt;ref name="kingston2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fass.kingston.ac.uk/research/helen-bamber/vane-ivanovic/|title=Vane Ivanovic Project - Helen Bamber Centre - Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences - Kingston University London|publisher=fass.kingston.ac.uk|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivanović would continue to help his fellow countrymen right up until his death, sponsoring a number of postgraduate students who fled the 1990s conflict in Yugoslavia, and was also one of the founders of [[Jean Monnet]]'s [[European Movement]], heading the Yugoslav Committee for more than three decades.

In 1967, Ivanović was appointed by Prince [[Rainier III]] to the post of consul general of [[Monaco]] in London.&lt;ref name="aim25"/&gt; His mother, Milica, subsequently moved there permanently and died in Monaco three years later. In 1977, he published his auto-biography entitled: ''LX, Memoirs of a Yugoslav''.

In 1982, the final memorandum of the "Democratic Alternative" argued that Yugoslavia could only survive as a democratic community of sovereign nations, and that any other scenario would almost inevitably lead to a civil war.&lt;ref name="yurope"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yurope.com/zines/republika/arhiva/99/211/211_24.html|title=Republika|publisher=yurope.com|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivanović lived long enough to witness the awful fulfillment of this prophecy with the outbreak of the [[Yugoslav wars]]. In 1990 Ivanović became a citizen of the Republic of Croatia.&lt;ref name="vane"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vane.hr/politics.htm|title=Vane|publisher=vane.hr|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in London on 4 April 1999. His father liked to point out that Ivanović was the first Yugoslav in the family. Born on the eve of unification, he died as its last remnants collapsed.

In 1939 Ivanović married June Fisher with whom he had two sons, Ivan Božidar ("Božo") and Andrija; and one daughter, Minja. His son Božo succeeded him as director of Ivanovic &amp; Co. and as Consul of Monaco upon his death.
