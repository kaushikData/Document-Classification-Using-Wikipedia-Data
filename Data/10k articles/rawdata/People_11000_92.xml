      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3568">'''[[Abdul Ghaffar Jutt Bron 1958|Abdul]] Ghaffar''' ({{lang-ar| عبد الغفار}}) and  '''Abdul Ghafoor''' ({{lang-ar| عبد الغفور}}) are two related male Muslim given names, and, in modern usage, surnames. They are built from the Arabic words ''[[Abd (Arabic)|Abd]]'', ''[[al-]]'' and either ''Ghaffar'' or ''Ghafoor'' respectively. Both names mean "servant of the All-forgiving", ''Al-Ghaffār'' and ''Al-Ghafūr'' being two of the [[names of God in the Qur'an]], which give rise to the [[List of Arabic theophoric names|Muslim theophoric names]].&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst &amp; Company| location=London| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rahman&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author= S. A. Rahman| publisher=Goodword Books|  location=New Delhi| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter ''a'' of the ''al-'' is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by ''u''. Alternative transliterations for the last word allow for the initial "gh" to appear as "g", the "ff" to appear as "f" or vice versa, and the "oo" to appear as "u" or "ou", all subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1471">'''Alois and Anna Bommer''' were a [[Germany|German]] couple who faced a [[military tribunal]] at [[Metz]] along with their three daughters after [[World War II]]. The family was accused of [[pillage]], having taken French property into Germany.

Their daughter Elfriede was under 16 at the time of the offences, and thus the tribunals had only the choices of a "reprimand" or "committal of the accused...to his parent's care" with a notice of conviction, and chose the former.&lt;ref name="law" /&gt;

The other two daughters, between the ages of 16 and 18 at the time of the offence, were imprisoned for four months apiece.&lt;ref name="law" /&gt;

Judgment was delivered on February 19, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Klip, Andre. "Annotated Leading Cases of International Criminal Tribunals", 2001 pp. 500&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Alois and Anna were convicted of both the theft of horses, furniture and linen, and the receiving of the same stolen property, an oddity since the crimes are exclusive; one cannot both have stolen goods, and then have received the same stolen goods.&lt;ref name="law"&gt;[[United Nations]], "Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals", 1949&lt;/ref&gt; They were also charged with the theft of silverware, jewellery and money.&lt;ref name="law" /&gt;

Their trial confirmed the principle that the laws of war apply equally to civilians and military personnel.&lt;ref name="law" /&gt;

[[File:Chen Yonglin.jpg|200px|thumb|Chen Yonglin]]

'''Chen Yonglin''' ({{zh|t=陳用林|s=陈用林}}) is a former [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] diplomat who sparked fears of a diplomatic incident through his defection to [[Australia]] in the summer of 2005. The episode highlighted the tensions faced by China's trade partners when concerns arise from that nation's [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights record]]. The episode was compared to the [[Petrov Affair]] by such observers as Shadow Minister for Immigration [[Laurie Ferguson]] and trade unionist [[Bill Shorten]].

==Background==
Chen had been a university student in [[Beijing]] during the pro-democracy movement that ultimately led to the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. Several of his friends were wounded in the ensuing repression by the government. He was said to have undergone political [[:wikt:reeducation|reeducation]] after the subsequent crackdown on [[dissident]]s, and joined the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1991. This culminated in his posting as the consul for political affairs in the Chinese consulate in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. In this position, Chen has stated that he was responsible for monitoring Chinese political dissidents, especially [[Falun Gong]], living in Australia. He also reportedly had access to highly classified information on Chinese intelligence activities in Australia. Chen has claimed that he had "gone easy" on dissidents and Falun Gong practitioners and had not reported some actions, to protest China's policies towards political dissent. He has also suggested that the Chinese government was becoming suspicious of his activities, and that as a result, he fears for his safety if returned to China. Chen remains unapologetic over his defection, insisting that he betrayed the [[Communist Party of China]], not China.

Factors contributing to the defection, according to Chen, are the torture and death of his father during the [[Cultural Revolution]], his witness of the Tiananmen Massacre and the persecution against the Falun Gong imposed by the Chinese Authorities.

==Defection and allegations==
On 26 May 2005, Chen walked out of the consulate with his wife and daughter. On that day he reportedly met an officer from the [[Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (Australia)|Department of Immigration]] who contacted the Chinese consulate to verify Chen's identity. A [[Australian Senate|Senate]] inquiry later criticized the government for this action, citing Chen's stated concern that such contact would put his life in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Standen |first=Susan |url=http://www.abc.net.au/ra/news/stories/s1458854.htm |title=News &amp;#124; ABC Radio Australia |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 31 May he met with a representative from the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]. Chen has stated that he was told at this meeting that his request for political asylum had been rejected, but that he could apply for a protection visa. The story broke to the international media on 3 June, when Chen contacted ''[[The Australian]]'' newspaper, sparking fears of a serious diplomatic incident between the two nations.  [[Anne Plunkett]]  the director of protocol at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade met with Chen, who alleges that she repeatedly urged him not to defect.&lt;ref name=Topsfield&gt;{{cite news|last1=Topsfield|first1=Jewel|title=Chinese diplomat was urged not to defect|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/chinese-diplomat-was-urged-not-to-defect/2005/07/26/1122143849438.html|accessdate=5 May 2015|publisher=The Age|date=27 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 June, though he allegedly feared being kidnapped, Chen came out of hiding to address a rally commemorating the 16th anniversary of the [[Tiananmen massacre#The crackdown|deaths in Tiananmen Square]]. During his speech, he claimed he would "reveal everything he knows". He also claimed that the Chinese government had more than a thousand agents in Australia, and that they were responsible for monitoring and kidnapping Chinese nationals back to China. Furthermore, Chen claimed that in one particular case in early 2000, Chinese agents in Sydney had kidnapped a student to force his father, [[Lan Fu]], a former senior Chinese official to return to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/fadt_ctte/asylum/report01/c05.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104142454/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/FADT_CTTE/asylum/report01/c05.htm |archivedate=2006-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the June 4th rally, Chen once again went into hiding, having claimed that he was under constant surveillance and in fear of his life. On 5 June, the Chinese embassy released a statement claiming that Chen was due to return home and had invented allegations of wrongdoing in the hope that he would be allowed to stay. The statement was intended to alleviate fears for Chen's safety if he returned to China.

==Support, opposition, and ultimate success==
On 7 June Chen's claims of a thousand-strong spy network were supported by [[Hao Fengjun]], a former police officer with the [[6-10 Office]], a special security force established to eradicate [[Falun Gong]] by whatever means they deem necessary. The Chinese government responded by claiming that documents seized from Hao's home in China had shown that he was a low-level policeman suspected of corruption. Hao's lawyer, [[Bernard Collaery]], attacked the claims, however, arguing that they were "standard [Chinese] tactics."  Hao was granted a protection visa by the Australian government in late July 2005.

On 7 July, a Chinese defector in [[Canada]] using the name [[Han Guangsheng]] emerged to support Chen and Hao's spying allegations. During his interview on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] show ''[[Lateline]]'', Han explained "I do know that the Communist Party of China sent people to collect intelligence information, including Chinese Embassy and Consulate staff. Some of the reporters coming from state Chinese media and visiting scholars are also given special spying tasks to carry out." The fifty-two-year-old defector has been denied political asylum and ruled ineligible to remain in Canada, because the federal Immigration and Refugee Board found him a "willing accomplice" in prior human rights abuses. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalnewsradio.com/index.php?nid=82&amp;sid=285509 |title=Federal News Radio |publisher=FederalNewsRadio.com |date= |accessdate=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appears consistent with Han's claim that he was in charge of [[Shenyang]]'s public security and [[laogai|labor camps]] before his defection. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2005/s1408570.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324062756/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2005/s1408570.htm |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's ambassador in [[Canberra]], [[Fu Ying]], condemned Chen for "attacking his motherland" with "allegations and noise" for what she claimed was the sole purpose of living in a wealthier country. She warned that many more would follow Chen, if he was allowed to relocate to Australia. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Chinese-ambassador-accuses-Chen-of-greed/2005/07/07/1120704478547.html?oneclick=true |title=Chinese ambassador accuses Chen of greed - Breaking News - National - Breaking News |publisher=Theage.com.au |date= |accessdate=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July, Chen Yonglin, his wife, and his 6-year-old daughter were granted permanent protection visas by the Immigration Department, despite the opposition of the Chinese government.

==Post-visa statements and activities==
Following the granting of protection visas to Chen and his family, he has met with Australian intelligence officials to discuss his earlier claims of a thousand-strong Chinese spy network. On 21 July Chen testified before the [[United States House of Representatives]] Subcommittee on Africa, Global Human Rights and International Operations as part of a panel discussing "Falun Gong and China's Continuing War on Human Rights." Here Chen broadened his earlier charges, stating: "I am aware there are over 1,000 Chinese secret agents and informants in Australia, and the number in the United States should not be less." He also testified that "The United States and Australia are considered by the CPC as the base of the Falun Gong overseas" and that "Chinese diplomats are required to denounce the Falun Gong and to distribute anti-Falun Gong materials whenever it is possible." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwc.house.gov/international_relations/109/22579.pdf |title=Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050916144041/http://wwwc.house.gov/international_relations/109/22579.pdf |archivedate=2005-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July, Chen attended a public seminar hosted by the Victorian Federation of Chinese Associations without invitation. There he defended and repeated his earlier spying allegations, and went on to claim that the VFCA was "controlled by the Chinese Consulate in Melbourne". The vice president of the federation, Sheng Wang, denied these claims and accused Chen of damaging the reputation of all Chinese Australians as well as undermining relations between China and Australia. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,16101674%255E663,00.html |title=Category: &amp;#124; Herald Sun |publisher=Heraldsun.news.com.au |date= |accessdate=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August, Chen was invited to a seminar at the [[University of Melbourne]].  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webdiary.smh.com.au/archives/001379.html |title=Margo Kingston's Webdiary - smh.com.au |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2006-01-15 |accessdate=2017-12-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060115122845/http://webdiary.smh.com.au/archives/001379.html |archivedate=2006-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 August, Chen accused the Chinese government of sending a three-member assassination squad into Australia, claiming he was alerted to their presence by a close friend in the foreign ministry. Chen told ABC TV, "they want to shut me up and ... they want to send a warning example to others who want to defect." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=37168 |title=Assassins out to kill me: Chen Yonglin |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824012550/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=37168 |archivedate=2005-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] called this "highly improbable."

In late September, Chen contended that the man in charge of China's spy network continued to operate out of the consulate-general in Sydney. As reported by ''[[The Bulletin]]'', this individual works independently of the consulate, complete with his own budget. Chen did not name this alleged spymaster. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=62059 |title=Iraqi diplomat seeks Australian asylum |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514024904/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=62059 |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October and November, Chen addressed the [[European Parliament]], the [[Flemish Parliament]] of [[Belgium]], and the [[British Parliament]] on the issue of humans rights in China. The Chinese Mission at the European Parliament sent three diplomats and three official media reporters to hear Chen's testimony at the European Parliament. While Chen was addressing to the British [[All-Party Parliamentary Group on Human Rights]] at the [[Palace of Westminster]], [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] [[Hu Jintao]] was visiting Westminster. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] was forced to raise the human rights issue with Hu under the pressure of overwhelming media attention.

On 30 March 2006, Chen joined more than 4000 signatories in an open letter to [[Australian Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] to question [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Wen Jiabao]] regarding the persecution against human rights lawyers in China by the Chinese Authorities and concern about allegations of [[Falun Gong and Live Organ Harvesting|live organ harvesting]] at the [[Shenyang]] Thrombosis Hospital &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clearwisdom.net/emh/articles/2006/4/7/71701.html |title=Commentary: As the World Loses Patience, The White House Responds to the Sujiatun Horror for the First Time &amp;#124; Falun Dafa - Minghui.org |publisher=Clearwisdom.net |date= |accessdate=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite official Chinese denials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4656">An unnamed&lt;ref&gt;Her name was probably Galla, Julia or Constantia, the names of her parents (Noel Emmanuel Lenski, ''The Cambridge companion to the Age of Constantine, Volume 13'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-521-52157-2}}, p. 107).&lt;/ref&gt; '''daughter of [[Julius Constantius]]''' was the first known wife of [[Constantius II]].&lt;ref name="roman-emperors.org"&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/gallus.htm Thomas M. Banchich , "Gallus Caesar (15 March 351 - 354 A.D.)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

She is mentioned in the "Letter To The Senate And People of Athens" by [[Julian the Apostate]] to have been a sister of [[Constantius Gallus]].&lt;ref name="roman-emperors.org" /&gt;  When mentioning the execution of Gallus by orders of Constantius II, Julian lists the several ways the two men were related. "Constantius gave over to his most inveterate enemies, his own cousin, the [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]], his [[Constantina|sister]]'s husband, the father of his niece, the man whose own sister he had himself married in earlier days".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/worksofemperorju02juliuoft"The Works of the Emperor Julian", 1913 translation by Wilmer Cave Wright, vol. 2, pages 253-255]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gallus was a son of [[Julius Constantius]] and his first wife [[Galla (wife of Julius Constantius)|Galla]]. She is assumed to be a full sister of Gallus.&lt;ref name="roman-emperors.org" /&gt; Julius Constantius was a son of [[Constantius Chlorus]] and [[Flavia Maximiana Theodora]]. He was a paternal half-brother of [[Constantine I]]. In 337, Constantine I died. Several of his relatives were killed shortly after his death. Julius Constantius was among them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/sibling.htm Michael DiMaio, Jr., "The Siblings of Constantine I"]&lt;/ref&gt; The "History of the Arians" (358) by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] reports on Constantius II having killed his father-in-law. Though Constantius had two later marriages, this is considered a reference to Julius Constantius. "The common feelings of humanity could not induce him to spare even his own kindred. His uncles he slew; his cousins he put out of the way; he commiserated not the sufferings of his father-in-law, though he had married his daughter, or of his kinsmen".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.xx.ii.viii.html Athanasius of Alexandria, "History of the Arians". Translation by Philip Schaff (1819-1893)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A brother is considered to have been assassinated with their father in 337. Julian the Apostate was a younger, paternal half-brother to this Empress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Marriage==

Her marriage to Constantius seems to be recorded in the [[Eusebius_of_Caesarea#Life_of_Constantine|Life of Constantine]] by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]. "On the completion of the thirtieth year of his [Constantine's] reign he solemnized the marriage of his second son [Constantius II],  having concluded that of his first-born long before. This was an occasion of great joy and festivity, the emperor himself attending on his son at the ceremony, and entertaining the guests of both sexes, the men and women in distinct and separate companies, with sumptuous hospitality. Rich presents likewise were liberally distributed among the cities and people." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/25024.htm Eusebius of Caesarea , "Life of Constantine", Book 4, Chapter 49]&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage can be estimated to 335 or 336.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Constantine I had been declared emperor in 306.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/conniei.htm Hans A. Pohlsander , "Constantine I (306 - 337 A.D.)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither her name nor the time of her death appear in surviving sources. Thomas M. Banchich, a modern historian, points that "her passing may have facilitated Gallus' fall in 353/4".&lt;ref name="roman-emperors.org" /&gt; The "Panegyric In Honour Of Eusebia" by Julian the Apostate places the marriage of [[Eusebia (empress)|Eusebia]], second wife of Constantius, prior to the defeat of rival emperor [[Magnentius]]. Magnentius was dead by August, 353. The marriage of Constantius and Eusebia may have occurred earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire]], vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[San Diego]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=car&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2012/12/2/0300/PM/The-Met-Orchestra |title=The MET Orchestra - Sunday, December 2, 2012 |publisher=Carnegie Hall |date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, natives of Taiwan, met as graduate students at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name=pour&gt;Eric Asimov, "The Pour: He Can Bring the Wine and the Music," ''New York Times'' (Nov. 19, 2008), p. D6.&lt;/ref&gt; He began his musical education at age 3 when his parents enrolled him in a violin class.&lt;ref name=pour/&gt;  At age 14 he won the [[San Diego Symphony]]'s Young Arts Concerto Competition, which enabled him to appear with the orchestra in two series of concerts. He was also the featured soloist with the San Diego Youth Symphony on their tour of Austria, Germany, Hungary and the former Czechoslovakia.

He received a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Harvard University]], and a [[master's degree]] from the [[Juilliard School]] in 1997, where he is currently on the faculty.&lt;ref name=jul&gt;[http://www.juilliard.edu/journal/portraits/faculty/archive/2009-10/0911.php  Juilliard Portraits: David Chan, Violin Faculty]&lt;/ref&gt;  His principal teachers were [[Dorothy DeLay]], [[Hyo Kang]] and Michael Tseitlin. He won the 5th prize at the [[International Tchaikovsky Competition]], and the third place bronze medal (with $10,000) and the Josef Gingold Prize at the [[International Violin Competition of Indianapolis]].&lt;ref name=ivci&gt;[http://www.violin.org/ivci/laureate_list2.html#davidchan International Violin Competition of Indianapolis Laureates, 1994 competition: David Chan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ind&gt;"Canadian Violinist Wins Indianapolis Contest," ''New York Times'' (Oct. 3, 1994), p. C16.&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his New York debut in on October 2, 1995 playing [[Paganini]]'s [[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Paganini)|Concerto no. 2]] with the Juilliard orchestra led by [[Hugh Wolff]].&lt;ref name=ivci/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Entertainment Events," ''New York Times'' (Oct. 2, 1995), p. C15.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has released two recordings: a recital album and a disc of two Paganini concertos with the English Chamber Orchestra, both for the Ambassador label.&lt;ref name=ivci/&gt;

He became one of the Metropolitan Opera's concertmasters in 2000.&lt;ref name=jul/&gt;  On February 2, 2003, the occasion of a Met Orchestra performance, he made his [[Carnegie Hall]] solo debut playing [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Concerto for Violin, Cello and Orchestra]] with Met colleague cellist Rafael Figueroa.  He was the soloist in [[Sofia Gubaidulina]]'s ''In Tempus Praesens'' (concerto for violin and orchestra) with the Met Orchestra in 2012. For [[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] [[Giulio Cesare]], Chan appeared onstage in costume during one of [[David Daniels (countertenor)|David Daniels']] arias to supply the [[obbligato]] violin part.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/arts/music/giulio-cesare-with-natalie-dessay-at-the-met.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Anthony Tommasini, "In Jodhpurs, Hailing Caesar With Seduction," ''New York Times'' (April 5, 2013), p. C1.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Met's 2012 tax return, Chan earned $394,652 for that year, making him the "highest-paid rank-and-file musician."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/metropolitan-operas-tax-filing-reveals-salary-details/ Brian Wise, "Metropolitan Opera's Tax Filing Reveals Salary Details," ''Operavore'' (WQXR) (June 16, 2014).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chan's career has included ample participation in [[chamber music]].  Articles from 1998 and 1999 show him as one of three members of the Emelin Trio.&lt;ref&gt;"Bard Festival Features Tchaikovsky," ''New York Times'' (Aug. 9, 1998), p. WE7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'Doctor Dolittle' on Stage: Music," ''New York Times'' (Jul. 25, 1999), p.

C5.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Met Chamber Ensemble, he has played in [[Alban Berg]]'s Chamber Concerto for Piano and Violin with 13 Wind Instruments, [[Richard Strauss]]'s [[Le bourgeois gentilhomme (Strauss)|Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme suite]], [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s ''[[Quatuor pour la fin du temps]]''  and other works, classical and contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/frame.htm  Metopera Database], search on "David Chan."&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the faculty of the Juilliard School in 2005.&lt;ref name=jul/&gt; He is also a faculty member at [[Mannes School of Music]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newschool.edu/mannes/faculty-az/?id=4d6a-6377-4e54-5535&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, Chan was named music director of Camerata Notturna, a chamber orchestra based in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://camerata-notturna.org/news/david_chan_music_director "David Chan Named Next Music Director of Camerata Notturna" Press release of the Camerata Notturna, June 7, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

He can be heard on the soundtrack of the films ''[[Teeth (film)|Teeth]]'' and ''[[The Caller (2008 film)|The Caller]]''.

After marrying his wife, violinist and Met colleague Catherine Ro,&lt;ref name=ivci/&gt; his father-in-law gave him a box of good wine.&lt;ref name=pour/&gt; Once he joined the Met Orchestra, he befriended colleagues who were wine [[connoisseur]]s. His budding interest led to an obsession with [[Burgundy wine]], to the point where he knew almost every [[vineyard]] on the [[Côte-d'Or]].

His interest in wine led him to meet with Bernard Hervet, chief executive of Maison Faiveley, and [[Aubert de Villaine]] of [[Domaine de la Romanee-Conti]]. Their meeting resulted in the founding of the festival ''Musique et Vin au Clos Vougeot'' in the Burgundy region of France, of which Chan is the music director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decanter.com/people-and-places/wine-articles/485209/david-chan-my-passion-for-wine Rosi Hanson, "My Passion For Wine," ''Decanter.com'' (Jan. 16, 2009).]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31253">The '''Four Horsemen''' are a [[fictional]] group from ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'' based on the Biblical [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]].

They were four [[Immortal (Highlander)|Immortals]] that murdered and looted across two continents in the [[Bronze Age]]. &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Caspian13.jpg|thumb|right|190px|The Four Horsemen]]  --&gt;
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:4horse.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Caspian (Highlander)|Caspian]], [[Silas (Highlander)|Silas]], [[Methos]] and [[Kronos (Highlander)|Kronos]]]] --&gt;

The horsemen consisted of:
*[[Kronos (Highlander)|Kronos]] (Pestilence)
*[[Methos]] ([[Death (personification)|Death]])
*[[Silas (Highlander)|Silas]] (War)
*[[Caspian (Highlander)|Caspian]] (Famine)

==Kronos==
'''Kronos''' is a [[fictional character]] from ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'', portrayed by actor [[Valentine Pelka]]. He is an [[Immortal (Highlander)|Immortal]]. Kronos represents Pestilence, as one of the Four Horsemen.

Kronos was the leader of the Four Horsemen. Along with [[Methos]], [[Silas (Highlander)|Silas]] and [[Caspian (Highlander)|Caspian]], he spread terror across two continents in the [[Bronze Age]], killing while roaming the  land and destroying everything in their way, just for the pleasure of it all. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Kronos14.jpg|thumb|190px|Kronos, leader of The Four Horsemen]]   --&gt;In November 1996, Kronos resurfaced in the city of Seacouver.  He tried to reunite his infamous brethren, The Four Horsemen again.  The Immortal female Cassandra, a former slave of The Four Horsemen was battling Kronos when [[Duncan MacLeod]] came across them. It was then that Duncan MacLeod  discovered the dark past of his close friend, the wily and peace-loving  Immortal [[Methos]]. For centuries,  Methos was one of the  infamous Four Horsemen. He destroyed, pillaged and plundered  a  myriad  lands  across  the world,  right alongside them.

Cassandra and MacLeod decided that all four of them had to be killed, though MacLeod still found it difficult to see his friend as an enemy. The two of them followed a trail laid by Methos to [[Bordeaux]], where they faced the Four Horsemen.

Kronos and Caspian were defeated after fierce and drawn-out battles by Duncan MacLeod (who had known Kronos as the vicious killer and outlaw  Melvin Koren in the [[American Old West]]). The Immortal Methos, who allied himself with Duncan MacLeod, beheaded the violent yet slow-witted Silas, his only true friend among The Four Horsemen. Cassandra then tried to kill Methos, her former captor, but was convinced by MacLeod to let him live.

===Reception===
Valentine Pelka's portrayal of the Immortal Kronos as a charismatic, funny and seductive yet evil warrior hellbent on world domination and destruction made him a favorite among ''Highlander'' fans.

===Appearances===
The character Kronos would also appear as an impersonation by the powerful demon [[Ahriman (Highlander)|Ahriman]], a formidable foe of Duncan MacLeod, in the episodes ''[[Episodes of Highlander (season 5)#Archangel|Archangel]] and [[Episodes of Highlander (season 6)#Armageddon|Armageddon]]''. He would make one last appearance in the series final episodes, 'To Be/Not To Be', in which a world without Duncan Macleod saw Kronos and Methos re-form The Horsemen, who were at war with James Horton's Hunters, who had seized control of the Watchers from Joe Dawson.

==Methos==
'''Methos''' is a [[fictional character]] from the ''[[Highlander (franchise)|Highlander]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]] - the film series, the television show ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'', and several fiction books. He is an [[Immortal (Highlander)|Immortal]]. He is portrayed by actor [[Peter Wingfield]] in both series and the movies. Methos, as one of the Four Horsemen, represented [[Death (personification)|death]].

Methos was first introduced in the ''Highlander'' episode "[[Episodes of Highlander (season 3)#Methos|Methos]]". It was originally planned to have him die at the end of the two-parter “[[Episodes of Highlander (season 3)#Finale|Finale]]”  episode, but the writers saw potential in the character and kept him.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Highlander: The Complete Watcher's Guide]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Highlander: The Series''===
36th century BC
 {{quote|Urik, Mesopotamia - Sumerians invent writing. [I have] been keeping [a journal] almost since writing began.&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt;}}

33rd century BC
 {{quote|Egypt - Egyptians start using hieroglyphics, and so do I.&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt;}}

 
Methos, when first introduced during Season 3, was portrayed as the "Oldest of the Immortals”. He claims he is roughly 5000 years + old,&lt;ref name="Methos episode"&gt;"[[Episodes of Highlander (season 3)#Methos|Methos]]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="One Minute To Midnight"&gt;“[[Episodes of Highlander (season 4)#One Minute to Midnight|One Minute To Midnight]]”&lt;/ref&gt; the approximate date he took his first head, but admits that “[b]efore that, it all starts to blur.”&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt;

According to the series, Methos had been keeping journals chronicling his life.&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt; Because of these journals, he was considered one of the Watcher Organization's greatest mysteries. His existence was doubted and questioned for many centuries. Methos (under the guise of Watcher Adam Pierson) was assigned to the writings chronicling the legendary Methos' past. These journals documented - with varied accuracy - much of his life. In doing so, he became somewhat of an off-field agent for [[Watcher (Highlander)|The Watchers]] and was able to keep tabs on other Immortals that he preferred to avoid. That changed when two Watchers died at the hand of Kalas, an evil Immortal.&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt;

During the third season [[Joe Dawson (Highlander)|Joe Dawson]], Duncan's Watcher and close friend, realized that Kalas was looking for Methos. Joe knew that with Methos's [[Quickening (Highlander)|Quickening]], Kalas could be unstoppable. Both Kalas and MacLeod raced to be the first to find Methos. Duncan's search led him to seek out the Watcher known as "Adam Pierson." When they first met, Duncan immediately sensed that Adam was an Immortal. Through his conversation with Adam, MacLeod realized that Adam was Methos.&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt; Duncan eventually killed Kalas on top of the Eiffel Tower in the season's finale.&lt;ref&gt;“[[Episodes of Highlander (season 3)#Finale|Finalé, Part 2]]”&lt;/ref&gt; Methos and Duncan become friends.

During the [[Bronze Age]], Methos rode alongside three other immortals: [[Silas (Highlander)|Silas]], [[Caspian (Highlander)|Caspian]], and [[Kronos (Highlander)|Kronos]], who were known as The Four Horsemen&lt;ref name="Comes A Horseman"&gt;“[[Episodes of Highlander (season 5)#Comes a Horseman|Comes A Horseman]]”&lt;/ref&gt; and who had plundered and raped across villages on two continents.&lt;ref name="Comes A Horseman" /&gt;&lt;ref name=" Revelation 6:8"&gt;“[[Episodes of Highlander (season 5)#Revelation 6:8|Revelation 6:8]]”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evening at Joe's"&gt;''[[Highlander: An Evening at Joe's|An Evening at Joe's]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Kronos tracked down Methos in order to get to MacLeod.&lt;ref name="Comes A Horseman" /&gt;

[[Cassandra (Highlander)|Cassandra]], an Immortal love interest of Duncan's and who was also tracking Kronos, pointed out to Duncan that Methos was actually [[Death (personification)|Death]]. She claimed he had enslaved her after destroying her village thousands of years ago.&lt;ref name="Comes A Horseman" /&gt;

Methos decided to flee, but Duncan caught him before he left. When asked whether Cassandra's accusations were true, Methos responded:

{{quote| I killed. But I didn't just kill fifty, I didn't kill a hundred. I killed a thousand. I killed TEN thousand! And I was good at it. And it wasn't for vengeance, it wasn't for greed. It was because... I liked it. Cassandra was nothing. Her village was nothing. Do you know who I was? I was Death. Death — Death on a horse. When mothers warned their children that the monster would get them, that monster was me. I was the nightmare that kept them awake at night. Is that what you want to hear?! The answer is yes. Oh, yes.&lt;ref name="Comes A Horseman" /&gt; }}

In that moment, Duncan decided to put an end to their friendship.&lt;ref name="Comes A Horseman" /&gt; Methos persuaded Kronos to put the band together again since he knew where both Caspian and Silas were. Kronos took the opportunity, relishing the idea of world domination again. In the end, Methos allied himself with Duncan MacLeod to destroy the Horsemen. The two defeated Kronos and Silas together in the same area, resulting in a powerful Double Quickening. Their friendship, however, still remained strained.&lt;ref name=" Revelation 6:8" /&gt;

Methos returned again in Season 6, the last season for the television series. During the episode "[[Episodes of Highlander (season 6)#Indiscretions|Indiscretions]]", he learns he's being chased by an obsessive Immortal named [[Morgan Walker]]. Walker hated him for having had an affair with his slave 200 years ago. Methos, trying to hide from Walker who had tracked him down, looked for  information in the Watchers' computer database. Joe Dawson was angry when he found out that Methos was only trying to save his own life by hacking into Joe's files, instead of explaining his whereabouts one year earlier. Although Joe and Methos' friendship was shaky, together they helped rescue a rookie Watcher and also Joe's illegitimate daughter, Amy Thomas. Their adventure helped them to rekindle their friendship and Methos was able to defeat Walker.&lt;ref name= Indiscretions /&gt;

====Alternate Methos====
During the series finale, Duncan MacLeod was thrown into another reality where he had never been born. In this reality, Methos had a lover named Jillian, who was killed by [[Watcher (Highlander)|The Watchers]] (who were trying to kill him). He survived their attack due to Kronos saving him. The event made him swear revenge to all the Watchers. He gathered together the Four Horsemen and also [[Richie Ryan (Highlander)|Richie Ryan]], but the Watchers killed Silas and Caspian. Methos later killed Richie, who couldn't bring himself to kill Joe Dawson on Methos's orders. Duncan MacLeod saw this with the help of [[Hugh Fitzcairn]]'s spirit, and tried to stop all of it. He fought Methos and killed him in revenge for Richie's death. In the same instant that Duncan executed the killing stroke, he returned to his original reality, where Methos tried to wake him up. In the end, it was the advice of Methos that put Duncan MacLeod back into [[Immortal (Highlander)#The Game|The Game]] once more.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Episodes of Highlander (season 6)#Not To Be|Not To Be]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other appearances===
According to the book ''[[Highlander: An Evening at Joe's|An Evening at Joe's]]'', he was born in [[ancient Egypt]] and was the second son of three boys and two girls, making him one of the few ancient immortals not known to be a foundling. When he was approximately 35 years old, the oasis at which his family lived ran dry. He had accompanied his family as they traveled to another oasis and experienced his first death when a sandstorm trapped them before they reached their destination. A [[Bedouin]] tribe found him and housed him for a while, teaching him the ways of survival in the desert. He stayed with them for many years, until it was evident that he wasn't aging. By the time he was an estimated 603 years old, he began to meet others that were like him. He then realized that there were many Immortals besides himself. He learned some facts of immortality from Menahem, an Immortal whom Methos considered ancient at the time. It was also during this time in his life that he took his first head, from another immortal named Joseph.&lt;ref name="Evening at Joe's" /&gt;

During time he spent in ancient Egypt an Immortal pharaoh named Djer took him under his wing. Methos soon learned that the Pharaoh had his nomad wife killed during a smiting of Sinai (the killing of all nomads). Angered at Djer, Methos buried him alive inside a sarcophagus deep within a tomb. He claimed Djer's throne and became Pharaoh of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Methos Chronicles]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
Methos is portrayed as having a dry sense of humor,&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Through A Glass, Darkly"&gt;"[[Episodes of Highlander (season 4)#Through a Glass, Darkly|Through A Glass, Darkly]]"&lt;/ref&gt; a pessimistic view on life,&lt;ref name="The Valkyrie"&gt;"[[Episodes of Highlander (season 5)#The Valkyrie|The Valkyrie]]"&lt;/ref&gt; a witty repartee,&lt;ref name=Timeless&gt;"[[Episodes of Highlander (season 4)#Timeless|Timeless]]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chivalry&gt;"[[Episodes of Highlander (season 4)#Chivalry|Chivalry]]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Till Death"&gt;"[[Episodes of Highlander (season 4)#Till Death|Till Death]]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Messenger"&gt;"[[Episodes of Highlander (season 5)#The Messenger|The Messenger]]"&lt;/ref&gt; and a somewhat loyal devotion to his friends.&lt;ref name= Indiscretions&gt;"[[Episodes of Highlander (season 6)#Indiscretions|Indiscretions]]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chivalry /&gt;&lt;ref name="Till Death" /&gt; He's also very untrusting of people,&lt;ref name="Through A Glass, Darkly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Valkyrie" /&gt; has been accused by others as putting himself first,&lt;ref name=" Revelation 6:8" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Indiscretions /&gt; as being arrogant,&lt;ref name="The Valkyrie" /&gt; and as being manipulative.&lt;ref name="Comes A Horseman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Messenger" /&gt; When in conversations with both Duncan and Richie, his manner is often comparable to that of a sarcastic old man (who hasn't managed to die yet), with his tendency to be right being rather annoying to his friends.&lt;ref name="Chivalry"/&gt; Ironically, Methos looks younger than most Immortals in the series, being physically stuck at ca. 25-35, causing his mannerisms to clash with his appearance. He has also the habit of saying "yes" after each sentence if he wants to emphasize whatever he is saying right now.&lt;ref name="Chivalry"/&gt; Methos is a method actor, being able to completely become whatever identity he has taken on at the time, but is able to switch to a far darker tone within a moment, surprising most people, and making them unsure of what to think of the "old man".&lt;ref name="Chivalry"/&gt;

Methos avoids battle and, for the most part, other Immortals whenever possible.&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt;&lt;ref name="One Minute To Midnight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Through A Glass, Darkly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Till Death" /&gt; In tune with this, it is hardly surprising that his Ivanhoe-style sword was quite subdued, simply serving the purpose of keeping him alive.&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt; He sleeps with his sword under his bed and sometimes carries a [[handgun]].&lt;ref name="Forgive Us Our Trespasses"&gt;"[[Episodes of Highlander (season 5)#Forgive Us Our Trespasses|Forgive Us Our Trespasses]]"&lt;/ref&gt; He rarely participated in [[Immortal (Highlander)#The Game &amp; The Prize|The Game]] (his preference was to observe rather than fight),&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Methuselah's Gift"&gt;"[[Episodes of Highlander (season 4)#Methuselah's Gift|Methuselah's Gift]]"&lt;/ref&gt; preferring to remain a legend so few would come looking for him.&lt;ref name="The Messenger" /&gt; Whenever he perceived that there was a great danger nearby, he had a habit of suddenly disappearing for a while.&lt;ref name="One Minute To Midnight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Comes A Horseman" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Indiscretions /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[Episodes of Highlander (season 4)#Judgement Day|Judgement Day]]"&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though he preferred to stay in the shadows, he could still defend himself when needed, and with time, his admittedly rusty skills would come back to life.&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt;&lt;ref name=" Revelation 6:8" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Indiscretions /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chivalry /&gt; In combat, he showed a deviousness and ruthlessness unmatched by most of his associates not considered evil, using underhanded tactics to win, such as a surprise attack with an additional dagger while locking his opponent's blade in defense.&lt;ref name="Forgive Us Our Trespasses"/&gt;

He considered opera music to be boring&lt;ref name="Till Death" /&gt; and he liked [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]],&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt; and other music as well. He collected things, mostly antiques that many people considered to be junk, claiming that he thought some of the "junk" could be his from the past.&lt;ref name="The Valkyrie" /&gt; He has also commented that although he knew most of everything in life, he was a bit weak in pop-cultural matters.&lt;ref name="Comes A Horseman" /&gt;

Methos often used the name "Adam" in some way in most of his aliases (likely a reference to the Biblical Adam and his extreme age). In the early 19th century, one of his aliases was “Benjamin Adams.”&lt;ref name="The Modern Prometheus"&gt;"[[Episodes of Highlander (season 5)#The Modern Prometheus|The Modern Prometheus]]"&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also known as “Ben Adams” when he moved to [[Arizona]] around 1860.&lt;ref name="Evening at Joe's" /&gt; Between 1980 and 1996 he was known as “Adam Pierson.”&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt; He also made rather frequent jokes and references to his age; Duncan and Joe often simply called him "Old Man". He is one of the few immortals who count their lifetimes in millennia, instead of centuries.

When an impostor calling himself Methos appeared he thought it was flattering, and was happy to let someone else be hunted for a while.&lt;ref name="The Messenger" /&gt;

===Professional degrees and credentials===
{{quote| Whatever you need: doctor, lawyer, Indian chief. I've got paperwork to cover it all.&lt;ref name="The Valkyrie" /&gt;}}

According to the episode “[[Episodes of Highlander (season 4)#One Minute to Midnight|One Minute To Midnight]]” he majored in medicine at the [[University of Heidelberg]] in [[Heidelberg]], Germany, in 1453.

He claims to have studied at the [[University of Paris]], majoring in classical studies.&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt;

===Friends and relationships===
Methos claims to have met [[Helen of Troy]],&lt;ref name="Comes A Horseman" /&gt; [[Socrates]],&lt;ref name="The Messenger" /&gt; [[Julius Caesar]],&lt;ref name="Comes A Horseman" /&gt; [[Jesus]],&lt;ref name="The Source"&gt;"[[Highlander: The Source|The Source]]"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cleopatra]].&lt;ref name="The Messenger" /&gt; He knew the [[England|English]] poets [[Byron]] and [[Percy Shelley]], the English author [[Mary Shelley]],&lt;ref name="The Modern Prometheus" /&gt; and rode with [[Butch Cassidy]] and [[The Sundance Kid]].&lt;ref name="Evening at Joe's" /&gt; In his first meeting with MacLeod, he said not many people can claim to have been on the same stage as both Julius Caesar and [[The Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt;

He's also been married 68 times, but never to an Immortal. According to him, it would be too much of a commitment.&lt;ref name="Till Death" /&gt;

====Alexa Bond====
He fell in love with a mortal named [[Alexa Bond (Highlander)|Alexa Bond]], a waitress who worked in Joe's bar, and who was terminally ill. Their relationship spanned three episodes ("[[Episodes of Highlander (season 4)#Timeless|Timeless]]", “[[Episodes of Highlander (season 4)#Deliverance|Deliverance]]”, and "[[Episodes of Highlander (season 4)#Methuselah's Gift|Methuselah's Gift]]") as well as multiple chapters (entitled:“Postcards From Alexa”) in the book ''[[Highlander: An Evening at Joe's|An Evening at Joe's]]''.

At first, Alexa refused his proposition of dating, because she didn't want to disappoint him as she was dying. However, Methos was persistent, and waited for her under the rain and asked her out on a date. He mentioned to Alexa that the reason for asking her on a date was "[b]ecause the alternative is unthinkable."&lt;ref name=Timeless /&gt; In his quest to make her feel alive even though she was dying, he wanted to make her dream come true by traveling the world.&lt;ref name="Evening at Joe's" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Timeless /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“[[Episodes of Highlander (season 4)#Deliverance|Deliverance]]”&lt;/ref&gt;

During their travels, Alexa became gravely ill. Methos wanted to use the Methuselah's Stone, rumored to be able to make a person Immortal, to save Alexa. He tried to steal it, with help from Amanda. Methos failed to retrieve the stone due to the intervention of the Watchers.&lt;ref name="Methuselah's Gift" /&gt; Methos remained at Alexa's side until she died of her illness.&lt;ref name="Through A Glass, Darkly" /&gt; It was her strength that taught Methos' humanity's will to live despite the fact they would ultimately die.  She was the person that opened his eyes, at the same time, cursed at the fact that with the power of immortality, he would have to live with the fact that he must watch her suffer and die.  A thing that Duncan knows too well.

====Amanda====
[[Amanda (Highlander)|Amanda]] and Methos had similar personalities in the series. Both are shown to be cunning, to think of themselves as a priority, and both remain loyal to their friends. When Amanda was captured by a nemesis of Duncan MacLeod's, Methos offered to help, saying he was “...fond of the little vixen [him]self.”&lt;ref&gt;"[[Episodes of Highlander (season 6)#To Be|To Be]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

She seemed to know Methos from earlier times and she also helped him when he tried to steal the Methuselah crystal.&lt;ref name="Methuselah's Gift" /&gt; When he failed, Amanda gave him a heartfelt hug and words of encouragement.&lt;ref name="Methuselah's Gift" /&gt;

====Duncan MacLeod====
Methos believes very strongly in [[Duncan MacLeod]]&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Source" /&gt; going so far as to offer him his head to defeat an evil Immortal.&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt; He often refers to MacLeod as a “[[Boy Scout]]”&lt;ref&gt;Through a Glass,  Darkly Season 4 x18&lt;/ref&gt; and tries to keep him out of trouble as much as possible.&lt;ref name="The Valkyrie" /&gt; Often, Methos will take on the opposite view of Duncan about situations, appearing to play [[devil's advocate]].&lt;ref name="The Valkyrie" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Messenger" /&gt; Although at times this quirk rubbed Duncan the wrong way, their friendship still remained relatively strong during the series and into the movies (even despite the events of “[[Episodes of Highlander (season 5)#Comes a Horseman|Comes A Horseman]]” and “[[Episodes of Highlander (season 5)#Revelation 6:8|Revelation 6:8]]”), as Duncan often seeks out Methos for help and guidance.&lt;ref name="The Source" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Highlander: Endgame]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Watchers ===
Nothing is known of his Watcher assignments, indeed, considering that he stayed ''among'' them for at least 200 years and being sought for likely even longer, it is presumable that he next-to-never had a watcher.&lt;br&gt;
During his time staying with the Watchers, he was essentially his own Watcher, tasked with locating himself (and thus preventing this altogether).

===Methos in The Game===
Sometime during his life, when realizing that for being the oldest Immortal, he was a primary target for all the other Immortals, he removed himself from [[Immortal (Highlander)#The Game &amp; The Prize|The Game]]. He hid within [[Watcher (Highlander)|The Watchers]], where he was put in charge of locating himself, essentially making himself his own watcher.&lt;ref name="Methos episode" /&gt; When Duncan MacLeod meets him in 1995, Methos had not taken a head for roughly 200 years; however, his sword skills were not diminished, although he admitted to be a little rusty, and later on also admitting he lacked the fire/passion to continue fighting at all.

==Silas==
'''Silas''' is a [[fictional character]] from ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'', portrayed by actor [[Richard Ridings]]. He is an [[Immortal (Highlander)|Immortal]]. Silas represents war as one of the Four Horsemen.

===History===

Silas was an Immortal known for great evil as a member of "The Four Horsemen"; a group of Immortals who raped and killed across two continents during the [[Bronze Age]]. The gruff-voiced Silas loves to do nothing more than kill, especially with the battle axe he wields. The Four Horseman came across a village where pre-Immortal Cassandra lived. The Four Horsemen killed everyone in her village. Silas and the others took trophies of their kills. Silas and [[Caspian (Highlander)|Caspian]] were fighting over a blanket. [[Kronos (Highlander)|Kronos]], the leader of the Horsemen used his sword to split the blanket in two. Silas was good friends with fellow Horseman, [[Methos]].

Silas then lived in [[Ukraine]], hiding in the woods for many centuries. In November 1996, he was chopping wood one day and sensed the presence of other Immortals: Kronos and Methos. The Four Horsemen are united after they got Caspian out of an insane asylum. They went to an abandoned submarine base in [[Bordeaux, France]]. Silas didn't realise how much times had changed, however, still wanting to ride on horseback to kill. Kronos makes plans to rule the world by developing a virus. Silas wanted one of the monkeys in the cage as a pet. Later on, Kronos sent Silas and Caspian to deal with [[Duncan MacLeod]]. Duncan beheaded Caspian and escaped while Silas returned to their hideout. Duncan goes there to rescue Cassandra, captured by the Horsemen. Duncan ends up fighting Kronos, and Silas goes to behead Cassandra, but Methos stops Silas and fights him. Silas is beheaded by Methos at the same time Duncan beheads Kronos. Duncan and Methos receive a Double Quickening.  Methos is grief-stricken for what he had done as he saw Silas the closest thing to a brother.

==Caspian==
'''Caspian''' is a [[fictional character]] from ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'', portrayed by actor [[Marcus Testory]]. Caspian represents [[famine]], as one of the Four Horsemen.

===History===

====Bronze Age====
An [[Immortal (Highlander)|immortal]], Caspian was born sometime in the 13th century BC. He was a member of the Four Horsemen, a group of mounted riders who terrorized, killed, and burned villages in two continents during the [[Bronze Age]].  He and fellow member [[Silas (Highlander)|Silas]] were always fighting. When they raided the village where Cassandra lived, Caspian and Silas fought over a blanket. [[Kronos (Highlander)|Kronos]], the leader of the Four Horsemen, ended up splitting the blanket so they could each have part of it.

====1996====
Centuries after his stint in the Four Horsemen, Caspian, under the alias Evan Caspari, became a [[serial killer]] in Romania. No one knows how many people he killed; he kept body parts in his basement, garden and his freezer. Caspian was arrested and sent to an asylum for the criminally insane outside of [[Bucharest, Romania]] where he was kept chained in a cell. Years later, in November 1996, Kronos attempted to reunite the Four Horsemen. Kronos, [[Methos]], and Silas visited the asylum, where Kronos bribed the doctor to see Caspian. Caspian killed the doctor and so the Four Horsemen reunited. They went to an abandoned submarine base in [[Bordeaux, France]] where they hid out. Kronos lays out his plan to rule the world, but Caspian is more anxious to kill.

A couple of days later, the Horsemen capture Cassandra from the hotel where she and Duncan MacLeod were staying while Duncan was visiting Methos on holy ground. Caspian and Silas, sent by Kronos to kill him, end up fighting MacLeod on a bridge. Caspian is killed, and before Silas can exact revenge, MacLeod escapes, jumping off the bridge while receiving the [[Quickening (Highlander)|Quickening]].

As "Famine," he has the propensity to consume living animals and possibly his victims. He eats a living roach in his cell at the asylum. He wants to eat one of the animals Kronos has caged at the submarine base (to Silas' protest). He threatens to cannibalize Duncan MacLeod at the beginning of their fight. Although not specifically stated in the show, these behaviors indicate that he possibly ate parts of his human victims, both as a serial killer in modern times and as one of the Horseman in the Bronze Age.

The native name of the Gin, '''''Kinh''''', simply means Vietnamese people and the Chinese character for the ethnic group, 京, is the same as in [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]]. They mainly live on three islands off the coast of [[Dongxing, Guangxi|Dongxing]], [[Fangchenggang]], in the Chinese autonomous region of [[Guangxi]].

The Gin population was estimated to be just over 28,000 as of 2010. This number does not include the 36,205 Vietnamese nationals studying or working in [[Mainland China]] recorded by the [[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|2010 national population census]].&lt;ref name="2010census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/newsandcomingevents/t20110429_402722638.htm |title=Major Figures on Residents from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan and Foreigners Covered by 2010 Population Census |publisher=National Bureau of Statistics of China |date=April 29, 2011 |accessdate=May 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514214156/http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/newsandcomingevents/t20110429_402722638.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ancestors of the Gin people immigrated to southern China from [[Vietnam]] during the 16th century and established communities on the three originally uninhabited islands of Wutou, Wanwei and Shanxin.&lt;ref name="Jing"&gt;[http://www.chine-informations.com/guide/jing_791.html Jing] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
The people of this very small ethnic minority have lived for about 500 years on the three islands of Wanwei, Wutou and Shanxin off the coast of [[Guangxi]], China, about 8km east of the border with Vietnam.
In the 1960s, the islands were connected to the mainland by a land reclamation project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Invisible China: A Journey Through Ethnic Borderlands
|first1= Colin |last1= Legerton |first2= Jacob |last2= Rawson
|publisher= Chicago Review Press |year= 2009
|isbn= 978-1-569-76263-9 |page= 85
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The islands are administered as part of [[Dongxing, Guangxi|Dongxing]] county within [[Fangchenggang]] prefecture.
A minority also live in nearby counties and towns with predominately [[Han Chinese]] or [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] populations.&lt;ref name = Jing/&gt;

The Gin live in a subtropical area with plenty of rainfall and rich mineral resources. The [[Beibu Gulf]] to its south is an ideal fishing ground. Of the more than 700 species of fish found there, over 200 are of great economic value and high yields. Pearls, sea horses and sea otters which grow in abundance are prized for their medicinal value. Seawater from the Beibu Gulf is good for salt making. The main crops there are rice, sweet potato, peanut, taro and millet, and sub-tropical fruits like [[papaya]], [[banana]], and [[longan]] are also plentiful. Mineral deposits include iron, [[monazite]], titanium, magnetite and silica. The large tracts of mangroves growing in marshy land along the coast are a rich source of [[tannin]], an essential raw material for the tanning industry.

== Language ==
The language of the Gin people is a [[Yue language|Yue]] dialect.&lt;ref name="olson"/&gt; Standard [[Cantonese]] is also spoken by many in the community as well as [[Mandarin Chinese]].  A survey in 1980 indicated that one third of Gin people had lost their native language and can only speak Cantonese or Mandarin, and another third who are bilingual in the Gin and Han Chinese languages.  The survey suggested a decline in the use of the Gin language, but in the 2000s, there appeared to be a revival in the use of the language.&lt;ref name="tsung"/&gt;

In addition to using [[Hanzi]], the Gin have their unique Zinan script, referred to as [[Chu Nom]] in Vietnamese, which is similar to the [[Sawndip|Zhuang old script]].&lt;ref name="olson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tsung"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=68CFBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title =Language Power and Hierarchy: Multilingual Education in China |author= Linda Tsung |date = 23 October 2014 |publisher = Bloomsbury Academic |page=188 |isbn=978-1441142351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created on the basis of the script of the Han people towards the end of the 13th century, it is found in old song books and religious scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/?id=Qc4ZAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Zinan |title = Russia and Eurasia, China |first1 = Paul |last1 = Friedrich |first2 = Norma |last2 = Diamond |year = 1994 |publisher = Hall |location= |page = 454 |isbn = 0-8161-1810-8 |accessdate = 2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Gin read and write in the Han script because they have lived with Hans for a long time.

== Culture ==

Gin people like [[antiphonal]] songs which are melodious and lyrical. Their traditional instruments include the two-stringed fiddle, flute, drum, gong and the single-stringed fiddle, a unique musical instrument of the ethnic group. Folk stories and legends abound. Their favorite dances feature lanterns, fancy colored sticks, embroidery and dragons.
 
Gin costume is simple and practical. Traditionally, women wear tight-fitting, collarless short blouses buttoned in front plus a diamond-shaped top apron and broad black or brown trousers. When going out, they would put on a light colored gown with narrow sleeves. They also like earrings. Men wear long jackets reaching down to the knees and girdles. Now most people dress themselves like their Han neighbors though a few elderly women retain their tradition and a few young women coil their hair and dye their teeth black. 

Many Gin are believers of Buddhism or Taoism, with a few followers of Catholicism. They also celebrate the [[Lunar New Year]], the [[Pure Brightness Festival]], the [[Dragon Boat Festival]], and the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] like the Han. 

[[Fish sauce]] is a favorite condiment of the Gin people for cooking, and a cake prepared with [[glutinous rice]] mixed with sesame is a great delicacy for them. 
There used to be some taboos, such as stepping over a fishing net placed on the beach.

'''Giuseppe Giacomo Gambino''' ([[Palermo]], May 21, 1941 – [[Milan]], November 30, 1996), also known as ''u tignusu'' (the bald one) was a member of [[the Mafia]] and head of the San Lorenzo [[mandamento (Sicilian Mafia)|mandamento]].

During the [[Second Mafia War]] in the beginning of the 1980s he was part of a "death squad" of the [[Corleonesi]] together with [[Mario Prestifilippo]], [[Filippo Marchese]], [[Vincenzo Puccio]], [[Gianbattista Pullarà]], [[Giuseppe Lucchese]], [[Giuseppe Greco]] and [[Nino Madonia]].

Since 1983, Gambino sat on the [[Sicilian Mafia Commission]]&lt;ref name=custodia&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.capitanoultimo.it/d/antimafiadoc3.htm Ordinanza di custodia cautelare in carcere], Tribunale di Caltanissetta, Ufficio del giudice per le indagini preliminari, April 11, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and was a close confidant of [[Totò Riina]].

Gambino was involved in the killing of Antimafia magistrates [[Giovanni Falcone]] and [[Paolo Borsellino]], as well as the politician [[Salvo Lima]] in 1992, and businessman [[Libero Grassi]] who opposed extortion by the Mafia.

He was arrested and committed suicide in the San Vittore prison in [[Milan]] on November 30, 1996.&lt;ref name=cds&gt;{{it icon}} [http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1996/dicembre/02/Boss_corleonese_impicca_carcere_co_0_9612029464.shtml Boss corleonese si impicca in carcere], Corriere della Sera, December 2, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

She was born in [[Kayunga District]] on 20 December 1979.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt; She attended Ndeeba Primary School in Kayunga District from 1986 to 1992, where she finished her Primary Leaving Examinations. Her father did not have money enough to take her to a very good secondary school so she joined Ndeeba Senior Secondary School for her S1 in 1993. Villagers in the village of Kisoga, in Kayunga District, recall how she used to be carried on a bicycle by a brother to school, about {{convert|14|km|mi}} from their home, daily. In 1994, Nantaba's mother acquired some money and Nantaba was moved from Ndeeba SSS to Katikamu SDA SSS where she studied from S2 to S6, from February 1994 to November 1998. On 26 September 1999, Nantaba was admitted to [[Makerere University]], together with the brother who used to ferry her to school, for a degree in tourism. She undertook an undergraduate student research project, "Medicinal Plants As Tourism Potential: Case Study of Uganda Wildlife Educational Center (UWEC)", which was supervised by Professor J. B. Nyakaana. Nantaba has a Bachelor of Tourism degree, obtained in 2003 from Makerere University.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/artsculture/Reviews/Who-is-idah-Nantaba-/691232-1538642-item-00-94bjikz/index.html | title=Who is Idah Nantaba? | newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] |location=Kampala | first=Fred | last=Mzaale|

{{Sufism|Notable modern}}

'''Idries Shah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|d|r|ɪ|s|_|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː}}; {{lang-ps|ادريس شاه}}, {{lang-ur|{{nq|ادریس شاه}}}}; 16&amp;nbsp;June 1924&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 23&amp;nbsp;November 1996), also known as '''Idris Shah''', né '''[[Sayyid|Sayed]] Idries el-[[Hashemite|Hashimi]]''' (Arabic: سيد إدريس هاشمي)  and by the [[pen name]] '''Arkon Daraul''', was an author and teacher in the [[Sufism|Sufi]] tradition who wrote over three dozen books on topics ranging from psychology and spirituality to travelogues and culture studies.

Born in [[India]], the descendant of a family of [[Pashtun people|Afghan]] nobles, Shah grew up mainly in England. His early writings centred on [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[witchcraft]]. In&amp;nbsp;1960 he established a publishing house, Octagon Press, producing translations of Sufi classics as well as titles of his own. His seminal work was ''[[The Sufis]]'', which appeared in&amp;nbsp;1964 and was well received internationally. In&amp;nbsp;1965, Shah founded the [[Institute for Cultural Research]], a London-based educational charity devoted to the study of human behaviour and culture. A similar organisation, the [[Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge]] (ISHK), exists in the United States, under the directorship of [[Stanford University]] psychology professor [[Robert Ornstein]], whom Shah appointed as his deputy in the U.S.

In his writings, Shah presented [[Sufism]] as a universal form of wisdom that predated [[Islam]]. Emphasizing that Sufism was not static but always adapted itself to the current time, place and people, he framed his teaching in Western psychological terms. Shah made extensive use of traditional [[teaching stories]] and [[parable]]s, texts that contained multiple layers of meaning designed to trigger insight and self-reflection in the reader. He is perhaps best known for his collections of humorous [[Nasreddin|Mulla Nasrudin]] stories.

Shah was at times criticized by [[Oriental studies|orientalists]] who questioned his credentials and background. His role in the controversy surrounding a new translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', published by his friend [[Robert Graves]] and his older brother [[Omar Ali-Shah]], came in for particular scrutiny. However, he also had many notable defenders, chief among them the novelist [[Doris Lessing]]. Shah came to be recognized as a spokesman for Sufism in the West and lectured as a visiting professor at a number of Western universities. His works have played a significant part in presenting Sufism as a form of spiritual wisdom approachable by individuals and not necessarily attached to any specific religion.&lt;ref name="Sufis54b"&gt;{{cite book

==Life==
===Family and early life===
Idries Shah was born in [[Shimla|Simla]], India, to an [[Afghan]]-[[Indian people|Indian]] father, Sirdar [[Ikbal Ali Shah]], a writer and diplomat, and a Scottish mother, [[Saira Elizabeth Luiza Shah]]. His family on the paternal side were [[Moosavi (name)|Musavi]] [[Sayyid]]s. Their ancestral home was near the [[Paghman Gardens]] of [[Kabul]].&lt;ref name=Saira&gt;{{cite book

Shah mainly grew up in the vicinity of [[London]].&lt;ref name="Hammer" /&gt; According to [[L. F. Rushbrook Williams]], Shah began accompanying his father in his travels from a very young age, and although they both travelled widely and often, they always returned to England where the family made their home for many years. Through these travels, which were often part of Ikbal Ali Shah's [[Sufi]] work, Shah was able to meet and spend time with prominent statesmen and distinguished personalities in both East and West. Williams writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Such an upbringing presented to a young man of marked intelligence, such as Idries Shah soon proved himself to possess, many opportunities to acquire a truly international outlook, a broad vision, and an acquaintance with people and places that any professional diplomat of more advanced age and longer experience might well envy. But a career of diplomacy did not attract Idries Shah...&lt;ref name=Williams-13-24&gt;{{cite book

Shah described his own unconventional upbringing in a 1971 BBC interview with Pat Williams. He described how his father and his extended family and friends always tried to expose the children to a "multiplicity of impacts" and a wide range of contacts and experiences with the intention of producing a well-rounded person. Shah described this as "the Sufi approach" to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|GriN_Wa8P30|1970 BBC interview with Idries Shah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his family moved from London to [[Oxford]] in 1940 to escape [[The Blitz]] (German bombing), he spent two or three years at the [[City of Oxford High School for Boys]].&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; In 1945, he accompanied his father to [[Uruguay]] as secretary to his father's ''[[halal]]'' meat mission. He returned to England in October 1946, following allegations of improper business dealings.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammer"/&gt;

===Personal life===
Shah married  the [[Parsi]] Cynthia (Kashfi) Kabraji in 1958; they had a daughter, [[Saira Shah|Saira]], in 1964, followed by twins – a son, [[Tahir Shah|Tahir]], and another daughter, [[Safia Shah|Safia]] – in 1966.&lt;ref name="Dangerously"&gt;{{cite news

===Friendship with Gerald Gardner and Robert Graves, and publication of ''The Sufis''===
Towards the end of the 1950s, Shah established contact with [[Wicca]]n circles in London and then acted as a secretary and companion to [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], the founder of modern Wicca, for some time.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamond"/&gt; In those days, Shah used to hold court for anyone interested in Sufism at a table in the Cosmo restaurant in [[Swiss Cottage]] (North London) every Tuesday evening.&lt;ref name="Lamond19"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamond|first=Frederic|authorlink=Frederic Lamond (Wiccan)|title=Fifty Years of Wicca|publisher=Green Magic|year=2005|page=19|isbn=0-9547230-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Shah founded his publishing house, [[Octagon Press]]; one of its first titles was Gardner's biography – ''Gerald Gardner, Witch''. The book was attributed to one of Gardner's followers, [[Jack Bracelin|Jack L. Bracelin]], but had in fact been written by Shah.&lt;ref name="Lamond"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamond|first=Frederic|title=Fifty Years of Wicca|publisher=Green Magic|year=2004|pages=9, 37|isbn=0-9547230-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Joanne|title=A Popular Dictionary of Paganism|publisher=[[Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group]]|year=2002|location=London, UK/New York, NY|page=28|isbn=0-7007-1591-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wiccan [[Frederic Lamond (Wiccan)|Frederic Lamond]], Bracelin's name was used because Shah "did not want to confuse his Sufi students by being seen to take an interest in another esoteric tradition."&lt;ref name="Lamond19"/&gt; Lamond said that Shah seemed to have become somewhat disillusioned with Gardner, and had told him one day, when he was visiting for tea:&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was interviewing Gerald, I sometimes wished I was a ''[[News of the World]]'' reporter. What marvellous material for an exposé! And yet I have it on good authority that this group will be the cornerstone of the religion of the coming age. But rationally, rationally I can't see it!&lt;ref name="Lamond19"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 1961, while on a trip to [[Mallorca]] with Gardner, Shah met the English poet [[Robert Graves]].&lt;ref name="OPrey213-215"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Prey|first=Paul|title=Between Moon and Moon – Selected Letters of Robert Graves 1946–1972|publisher=[[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]]|year=1984|pages=213–215|isbn=0-09-155750-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shah wrote to Graves from his ''[[Pension (lodging)|pension]]'' in [[Palma de Mallorca|Palma]], requesting an opportunity of "saluting you one day before very long".&lt;ref name="OPrey213-215"/&gt; He added that he was currently researching ecstatic religions, and that he had been "attending... experiments conducted by the witches in Britain, into mushroom-eating and so on" – a topic that had been of interest to Graves for some time.&lt;ref name="OPrey213-215"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Graves2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graves|first=Richard P.|title=''Robert Graves and The White Goddess 1940–1985''|publisher=Phoenix Giant|year=1998|location=London, UK|page=326|isbn=0-7538-0116-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah also told Graves that he was "intensely preoccupied at the moment with the carrying forward of ecstatic and intuitive knowledge."&lt;ref name="Graves2"/&gt; Graves and Shah soon became close friends and confidants.&lt;ref name="OPrey213-215"/&gt; Graves took a supportive interest in Shah's writing career and encouraged him to publish an authoritative treatment of Sufism for a Western readership, along with the practical means for its study; this was to become ''[[The Sufis]]''. Shah managed to obtain a substantial advance on the book, resolving temporary financial difficulties.&lt;ref name="OPrey213-215"/&gt;

In 1964, ''The Sufis'' appeared,&lt;ref name="Hammer"/&gt; published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], with a long introduction by Robert Graves.&lt;ref name="OISTI"/&gt; The book chronicles the impact of Sufism on the development of Western civilisation and traditions from the seventh century onward through the work of such figures as [[Roger Bacon]], [[John of the Cross]], [[Raymond Lully]], [[Chaucer]] and others, and has become a classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial Reviews for Idries Shah's ''The Sufis''|publisher=amazon.com|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sufis-Idries-Shah/dp/product-description/0385079664|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Shah's other books on the topic, ''The Sufis'' was conspicuous for avoiding terminology that might have identified his interpretation of Sufism with traditional Islam.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Jane I.|title=Islam in America (Columbia Contemporary American Religion Series)|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=1999|location=New York, NY/Chichester, UK|page=69|isbn=0-231-10966-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also employed a deliberately "scattered" style; Shah wrote to Graves that its aim was to "de-condition people, and prevent their reconditioning"; had it been otherwise, he might have used a more conventional form of exposition. The book sold poorly at first, and Shah invested a considerable amount of his own money in advertising it.&lt;ref name="OPrey236240"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Prey|first=Paul|title=Between Moon and Moon – Selected Letters of Robert Graves 1946–1972|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1984|pages=236, 239, 240|isbn=0-09-155750-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graves told him not to worry; even though he had some misgivings about the writing, and was hurt that Shah had not allowed him to proofread it before publication, he said he was "so proud in having assisted in its publication", and assured Shah that it was "a marvellous book, and will be recognised as such before long. Leave it to find its own readers who will hear your voice spreading, not those envisaged by Doubleday."&lt;ref name="OPrey240241"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Prey|first=Paul|title=Between Moon and Moon – Selected Letters of Robert Graves 1946–1972|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1984|pages=234, 240–241, 269|isbn=0-09-155750-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John G. Bennett and the Gurdjieff connection===
In June 1962, a couple of years prior to the publication of ''The Sufis'', Shah had also established contact with members of the movement that had formed around the [[mysticism|mystical]] teachings of [[Gurdjieff]] and [[P. D. Ouspensky|Ouspensky]].&lt;ref name="Elwell14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt; A press article had appeared,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Augy Hayter, a student of both Idries and Omar Ali-Shah, asserts that the article, published in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'', was written by Idries Shah under a pseudonym. When Reggie Hoare, a Gurdjieffian and associate of Bennett's, wrote to the author care of the magazine, intrigued by the description of exercises known only to a very small number of Gurdjieff students, it was Shah who replied to Hoare, and Hoare who introduced Shah to Bennett. Shah himself according to Hayter later described the ''Blackwood's Magazine'' article as "trawling". ({{cite book|last=Hayter|first=Augy|title=Fictions and Factions|publisher=Tractus Books|year=2002|location=Reno, NV/Paris, France|page=187|isbn=2-909347-14-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; describing the author's visit to a secret monastery in Central Asia, where methods strikingly similar to Gurdjieff's methods were apparently being taught.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt; The otherwise unattested monastery had, it was implied, a representative in England.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

One of Ouspensky's earliest pupils, Reggie Hoare, who had been part of the Gurdjieff work since 1924, made contact with Shah through that article. Hoare "attached special significance to what Shah had told him about the [[Fourth Way enneagram|Enneagram]] symbol and said that Shah had revealed secrets about it that went far beyond what we had heard from Ouspensky."&lt;ref name=Bennett2/&gt; Through Hoare, Shah was introduced to other Gurdjieffians, including [[John G. Bennett]], a noted Gurdjieff student and founder of an "Institute for the Comparative Study of History, Philosophy and the Sciences" located at Coombe Springs, a {{convert|7|acre|hectare|adj=on}} estate in [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=Bennett2&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=John G.|authorlink=John G. Bennett|title=Witness: The autobiography of John G. Bennett|publisher=Omen Press|year=1974|location=Tucson|pages=355–63|isbn=0-912358-48-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, Bennett had already investigated the Sufi origins of many of Gurdjieff's teachings, based on both Gurdjieff's own numerous statements, and on travels Bennett himself made in the East where he met various Sufi Sheikhs.&lt;ref name=Bennett3b&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=John G.|authorlink=John G. Bennett|title=Gurdjieff: Making a New World|publisher=Turnstone Books|year=1973|location=Santa Fe, NM|page=21|isbn=0-9621901-6-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was convinced that Gurdjieff had adopted many of the ideas and techniques of the Sufis and that, for those who heard Gurdjieff's lectures in the early 1920s, "the Sufi origin of his teaching was unmistakable to anyone who had studied both."&lt;ref name=Bennett3&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=John G.|authorlink=John G. Bennett|title=Gurdjieff: Making a New World|publisher=Turnstone Books|year=1973|location=Santa Fe, NM|page=104|isbn=0-9621901-6-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bennett wrote about his first meeting with Shah in his autobiography ''Witness'' (1974):&lt;blockquote&gt;At first, I was wary. I had just decided to go forward on my own and now another 'teacher' had appeared. One or two conversations with Reggie convinced me that I ought at least to see for myself. Elizabeth and I went to dinner with the Hoares to meet Shah, who turned out to be a young man in his early 40s. He spoke impeccable English and but for his beard and some of his gestures might well have been taken for an English public school type. Our first impressions were unfavourable. He was restless, smoked incessantly and seemed too intent on making a good impression. Halfway through the evening, our attitude completely changed. We recognized that he was not only an unusually gifted man, but that he had the indefinable something that marks the man who has worked seriously upon himself... Knowing Reggie to be a very cautious man, trained moreover in assessing information by many years in the Intelligence Service, I accepted his assurances and also his belief that Shah had a very important mission in the West that we ought to help him to accomplish.&lt;ref name="Bennett2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shah gave Bennett a "Declaration of the People of the Tradition"&lt;ref name="DeclarationPDF"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=Declaration of the People of the Tradition and Twenty-Two Principles|publisher=Sher Point Publications, UK|date=13 April 2007|url=https://xyzzy.jumpingcrab.com/sherpoint/docs/DeclarationOfThePeople.pdf|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011145738/https://xyzzy.jumpingcrab.com/sherpoint/docs/DeclarationOfThePeople.pdf|archive-date=11 Oct 2018|dead-url=yes|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and authorised him to share this with other Gurdjieffians.&lt;ref name=Bennett /&gt; The document announced that there was now an opportunity for the transmission of "a secret, hidden, special, superior form of knowledge"; combined with the personal impression Bennett formed of Shah, it convinced Bennett that Shah was a genuine emissary of the "[[Sarmoung]] Monastery" in [[Afghanistan]], an inner circle of Sufis whose teachings had inspired Gurdjieff.&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=John G.|authorlink=John G.

For the next few years, Bennett and Shah had weekly private talks that lasted for hours. Later, Shah also gave talks to the students at Coombe Springs. Bennett says that Shah's plans included "reaching people who occupied positions of authority and power who were already half-consciously aware that the problems of mankind could no longer be solved by economic, political or social action. Such people were touched, he said, by the new forces moving in the world to help mankind to survive the coming crisis."&lt;ref name=Bennett2 /&gt;

Bennett agreed with these ideas and also agreed that "people attracted by overtly spiritual or esoteric movements seldom possessed the qualities needed to reach and occupy positions of authority" and that "there were sufficient grounds for believing that throughout the world there were already people occupying important positions, who were capable of looking beyond the limitations of nationality and cultures and who could see for themselves that the only hope for mankind lies in the intervention of a Higher Source."&lt;ref name="Bennett2"/&gt;

Bennett wrote, "I had seen enough of Shah to know that he was no charlatan or idle boaster and that he was intensely serious about the task he had been given."&lt;ref name="Bennett2"/&gt; Wishing to support Shah's work, Bennett decided in 1965, after agonising for a long time and discussing the matter with the council and members of his Institute, to give the Coombe Springs property to Shah, who had insisted that any such gift must be made with no strings attached.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt; Once the property was transferred to Shah, he banned Bennett's associates from visiting, and made Bennett himself feel unwelcome.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt;

Bennett says he did receive an invitation to the "Midsummer Revels", a party Shah held at Coombe Springs that lasted two days and two nights, primarily for the young people whom Shah was then attracting.&lt;ref name=Bennett2/&gt; [[A. G. E. Blake|Anthony Blake]], who worked with Bennett for 15 years, says, "When Idries Shah acquired Coombe Springs, his main activity was giving parties. I had only a few encounters with him but much enjoyed his irreverent attitude. Bennett once said to me, 'There are different styles in the work. Mine is like Gurdjieff's, around struggle with one's denial. But Shah's way is to treat the work as a joke.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthonyblake.co.uk/Meetings.html |title=Meetings |website=Anthonyblake.co.uk |accessdate=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few months, Shah sold the plot – worth more than £100,000 – to a developer and used the proceeds to establish himself and his work activities at Langton House in [[Langton Green]], near [[Tunbridge Wells]], a 50-acre estate that once belonged to the family of [[Lord Baden-Powell]], founder of the [[Boy Scouts]].&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall 56"&gt;{{cite journal

Along with the Coombe Springs property, Bennett also handed the care of his body of pupils to Shah, comprising some 300 people.&lt;ref name=Bennett /&gt; Shah promised he would integrate all those who were suitable; about half of their number found a place in Shah's work.&lt;ref name=Bennett /&gt; Some 20 years later, the Gurdjieffian author [[James Moore (Cornish author)|James Moore]] suggested that Bennett had been duped by Shah.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; Bennett gave an account of the matter himself in his autobiography (1974); he said that Shah's behaviour after the transfer of the property was "hard to bear", but also insisted that Shah was a "man of exquisite manners and delicate sensibilities" and considered that Shah might have adopted his behaviour deliberately, "to make sure that all bonds with Coombe Springs were severed".&lt;ref name=Bennett /&gt; He added that Langton Green was a far more suitable place for Shah's work than Coombe Springs could have been and said he felt no sadness that Coombe Springs lost its identity; he concluded his account of the matter by stating that he had "gained freedom" through his contact with Shah, and had learned "to love people whom [he] could not understand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

I had learned to serve and to sacrifice and I knew that I was free from attachments. It happened about the end of the time that I went on business to America and met with Madame de Salzmann in New York. She was very curious about Idries Shah and asked what I had gained from my contact with him. I replied: "Freedom!"... Not only had I gained freedom, but I had come to love people whom I could not understand."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bennett, Shah later also engaged in discussions with the heads of the Gurdjieff groups in New York. In a letter to Paul Anderson from 5 March 1968, Bennett wrote, "Madame de Salzmann and all the others... are aware of their own limitations and do no more than they are able to do. While I was in New York, Elizabeth and I visited the Foundation, and we saw most of the leading people in the New York group as well as [[Jeanne de Salzmann]] herself. Something is preparing, but whether it will come to fruition I cannot tell. I refer to their connection with Idries Shah and his capacity for turning everything upside down. It is useless with such people to be passive, and it is useless to avoid the issue. For the time being, we can only hope that some good will come, and meanwhile continue our own work..."&lt;ref name=Speeth&gt;{{cite book|last=Speeth|first=Kathleen|title=The Gurdjieff Work|publisher=Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam|year=1989|location=New York|page=105|isbn=0-87477-492-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author and clinical psychologist [[Kathleen Speeth]] later wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Witnessing the growing conservatism within the [Gurdjieff] Foundation, John Bennett hoped new blood and leadership would come from elsewhere... Although there may have been flirtation with Shah, nothing came of it. The prevailing sense [among the leaders of the Gurdjieff work] that nothing must change, that a treasure in their safekeeping must at all costs be preserved in its original form, was stronger than any wish for a new wave of inspiration."&lt;ref name="Speeth"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sufi studies and institutes===
In 1965, Shah founded the Society for Understanding Fundamental Ideas (SUFI), later renamed [[The Institute for Cultural Research]] (ICR) – an educational charity aimed at stimulating "study, debate, education and research into all aspects of human thought, behaviour and culture".&lt;ref name="OISTI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Makers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DTOB" /&gt; He also established the Society for Sufi Studies (SSS).&lt;ref name="Galin" /&gt;

Langton House at Langton Green became a place of gathering and discussion for poets, philosophers and statesmen from around the world, and an established part of the literary scene of the time.&lt;ref name="Writers Meet"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Writers Meet|journal=The Courier|page=16|date=15 October 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICR held meetings and gave lectures there, awarding fellowships to international scholars including [[Sir John Glubb]], [[Aquila Berlas Kiani]], [[Richard Gregory]] and [[Robert Cecil (British diplomat)|Robert Cecil]], the head of European studies at the University of Reading who became Chairman of the Institute in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Writers Meet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICR fellows"&gt;{{cite web|title=ICR Fellows|publisher=[[The Institute for Cultural Research]]|url=http://www.i-c-r.org.uk/fellows.php|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah was an early member and supporter of the [[Club of Rome]],&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Some sources have described Shah as a "founding member" of the Club of Rome. Augy Hayter states, "To a certain extent, one can say that a good deal of the literature put out by Shah and friends under various pseudonyms was designed to act as a decoy. It occupied would-be students and opponents alike, and inflamed critics to quite amazing degree. A lot of it was fake: Shah knew perfectly well that he was not a founding member of the Club of Rome; he was a member for a short time and was politely asked to leave because he didn't turn up to meetings; but this mythology around Shah's public personage was necessary in order to provide the dream-lie without which no truth can exist, because a student must always have a choice."({{cite book|last=Hayter|first=Augy|title=Fictions and Factions|publisher=Tractus Books|year=2002|location=Reno, NV/Paris, France|page=262|isbn=2-909347-14-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; and several presentations were given to the Institute by scientists like [[Alexander King (scientist)|Alexander King]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=Elizabeth|title=At Home in East and West: A Sketch of Idries Shah|journal=[[Psychology Today]]|volume=9|issue=2|page=56|date=July 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICRSciTEch"&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=Dr. Alexander|title=Monograph Series No. 10: Science, Technology and the Quality of Life|publisher=[[The Institute for Cultural Research]]|url=http://www.i-c-r.org.uk/publications/monographarchive.php#M10|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICREyeToFuture"&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=Dr. Alexander|title=Monograph Series No. 15: An Eye to the Future|publisher=[[The Institute for Cultural Research]]|url=http://www.i-c-r.org.uk/publications/monographarchive.php#M15|accessdate=14 September 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other visitors, pupils, and would-be pupils included the poet [[Ted Hughes]], novelists [[J. D. Salinger]], [[Alan Sillitoe]] and [[Doris Lessing]], zoologist [[Desmond Morris]], and psychologist [[Robert Ornstein]]. The interior of the house was decorated in a Middle-Eastern fashion, and buffet lunches were held every Sunday for guests in a large dining room that was once the estate stable, nicknamed "The Elephant" (a reference to the Eastern tale of the "[[Blind men and an elephant|Elephant in the Dark]]").&lt;ref name="Hall 56"/&gt;

Over the following years, Shah developed [[Octagon Press]] as a means of publishing and distributing reprints of translations of numerous Sufi classics.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; In addition, he collected, translated and wrote thousands of Sufi tales, making these available to a Western audience through his books and lectures.&lt;ref name="Galin"/&gt; Several of Shah's books feature the [[Nasreddin|Mullah Nasruddin]] character, sometimes with illustrations provided by [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]]. In Shah's interpretation, the Mulla Nasruddin stories, previously considered a folkloric part of Muslim cultures, were presented as Sufi [[parable]]s.&lt;ref name="SW32"/&gt; 

Nasruddin was featured in Shah's television documentary ''Dreamwalkers'', which aired on the BBC in 1970. Segments included Richard Williams being interviewed about [[The Thief and the Cobbler|his unfinished animated film]] about Nasruddin, and scientist John Kermisch discussing the use of Nasruddin stories at the [[Rand Corporation]] [[Think Tank]]. Other guests included the British psychiatrist [[William Sargant]] discussing the hampering effects of [[brainwashing]] and [[social conditioning]] on creativity and problem-solving, and the comedian [[Marty Feldman]] talking with Shah about the role of humour and ritual in human life. The program ended with Shah asserting that humanity could further its own evolution by "breaking psychological limitations" but that there was a "constant accretion of pessimism which effectively prevents evolution in this form from going ahead... Man is asleep – must he die before he wakes up?"&lt;ref name="OnePairOfEyesVideo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shah|first=Idries (Presenter)|title=One Pair of eyes: Dreamwalkers|publisher=[[BBC Television]]|date=19 December 1970|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v0oGh7mTV0|format=video|accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah also organised Sufi study groups in the United States. [[Claudio Naranjo]], a [[Chilean people|Chilean]] psychiatrist who was teaching in California in the late 1960s, says that, after being "disappointed in the extent to which Gurdjieff's school entailed a living lineage", he had turned towards Sufism and had "become part of a group under the guidance of Idries Shah."&lt;ref name=Naranjo&gt;{{cite book|last=Naranjo|first=Claudio|authorlink=Claudio Naranjo|title=Character and Neurosis|publisher=Gateways|year=1994|location=Nevada City, CA|page=xxviii|isbn=0-89556-066-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naranjo co-wrote a book with [[Robert Ornstein]], entitled ''On The Psychology of Meditation'' (1971). Both of them were associated with the [[University of California]], where Ornstein was a research psychologist at the [[Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute]].&lt;ref name=Naranjo2&gt;{{cite book|last=Naranjo|first=Claudio|author2=Robert Ornstein|title=On the Psychology of Meditation|publisher=Viking Press|year=1972|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-670-00364-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ornstein was also president and founder of the [[Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge]], established in 1969; seeing a need in the U.S. for books and collections on ancient and new ways of thinking, he formed the [[Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge|ISHK]] Book Service in 1972 as a central source for important contemporary and traditional literature, becoming the sole U.S. distributor of the works of Idries Shah published by Octagon Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ishkbooks.com/ishk_history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215175421/http://www.ishkbooks.com/ishk_history.html |archivedate=15 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Shah associate, the scientist and professor [[Leonard Lewin (telecommunications engineer)|Leonard Lewin]], who was teaching telecommunications at the [[University of Colorado]] at the time, set up Sufi study groups and other enterprises for the promotion of Sufi ideas like the Institute for Research on the Dissemination of Human Knowledge (IRDHK), and also edited an anthology of writings by and about Shah entitled ''The Diffusion of Sufi Ideas in the West'' (1972).&lt;ref name=Lewin-no-page&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewin|first=Leonard|title=Diffusion of Sufi Ideas in the West| publisher=Keysign Press|year=1972|location=Boulder, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-c-r.org.uk/fellows.php |title=Dr Kate Fox : The Institute for Cultural Research |website=I-c-r.org.uk |accessdate=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planned animated feature film by Williams, provisionally titled ''The Amazing Nasruddin'', never materialised, as the relationship between Williams and the Shah family soured in 1972 amid disputes about copyrights and funds; however, Williams later used some of the ideas for his film ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dessem|first=Matthew|url=https://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/602-animations-lost-masterpiece/|title=Animation's lost masterpiece|date=5 June 2014|work=[[The Dissolve]]|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
===Books on magic and the occult===
Shah's early books were studies of what he called "minority beliefs". His first book ''[[Oriental Magic]]'', published in 1956, was originally intended to be titled ''Considerations in Eastern and African Minority Beliefs''. He followed this in 1957 with ''The Secret Lore of Magic: Book of the Sorcerers'', originally entitled ''Some Materials on European Minority-Belief Literature''. The names of these books were, according to a contributor to a 1973 ''festschrift'' for Shah, changed before publication due to the "exigencies of commercial publishing practices."&lt;ref name=Williams-230-231&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=L.F. Rushbrook|title=Sufi Studies: East and West|publisher=E.P. Dutton &amp; Co.|year=1974|location=New York, NY|pages=230–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his death in 1969, Shah's father asserted that the reason why he and his son had published books on the subject of magic and the occult was "to forestall a probable popular revival or belief among a significant number of people in this nonsense. My son... eventually completed this task, when he researched for several years and published two important books on the subject."&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Sirdar Ikbal Ali (1992). ''Alone in Arabian Nights''. London: Octagon Press Ltd. p. 136; {{ISBN|0-86304-063-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in ''[[Psychology Today]]'' from 1975, Shah elaborated:&lt;blockquote&gt;The main purpose of my books on magic was to make this material available to the general reader. For too long people believed that there were secret books, hidden places, and amazing things. They held onto this information as something to frighten themselves with. So the first purpose was information. This is the magic of East and West. That's all. There is no more. The second purpose of those books was to show that there do seem to be forces, some of which are either rationalized by this magic or may be developed from it, which do not come within customary physics or within the experience of ordinary people. I think this should be studied, that we should gather the data and analyze the phenomena. We need to separate the chemistry of magic from the alchemy, as it were.&lt;ref name="Hall 61"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=Elizabeth|url=http://www.idriesshahfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Psychology-Today.pdf|title=The Sufi Tradition: A Conversation with Idries Shah|journal=[[Psychology Today]]|volume=9|issue=2|page=61|date=July 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shah went on to say that his books on the subject were not written for the current devotees of magic and witchcraft, and that in fact he subsequently had to avoid them, as they would only be disappointed in what he had to say.&lt;ref name="Hall 61"/&gt;

These books were followed by the publication of the travelogue ''[[Destination Mecca]]'' (1957), which was featured on television by Sir [[David Attenborough]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1970/oct/22/the-mysterious-east-2/?pagination=false Lessing, Doris (1970). "The Mysterious East". ''[[The New York Times]]'' Review of Books, 22 October]&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Destination Mecca'' and ''Oriental Magic'' contain sections on the subject of [[Sufism]].&lt;ref name=Oriental&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Sayed Idries|title=Oriental Magic|publisher=Octagon Press, Ltd.|year=1956|location=London, UK|pages=59–75|isbn=0-86304-017-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Destination&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=Destination Mecca|publisher=Octagon Press|origyear=1957|year=1971|location=London, UK|pages=169–78|isbn=0-900860-13-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufism as a form of timeless wisdom===
Shah presented Sufism as a form of timeless wisdom that predated Islam.&lt;ref name="Farouki"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taji-Farouki|first=Suha|author2=Nafi, Basheer M. (eds.)|title=Islamic Thought in the Twentieth Century|publisher=I.B.Tauris Publishers|year=2004|location=London, UK/New York, NY|page=123|isbn=1-85043-751-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasised that the nature of Sufism was alive, not static, and that it always adapted its visible manifestations to new times, places and people: "Sufi schools are like waves which break upon rocks: [they are] from the same sea, in different forms, for the same purpose," he wrote, quoting [[Ahmad al-Badawi]].&lt;ref name="Galin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farouki"/&gt;

Shah was often dismissive of orientalists' descriptions of Sufism, holding that academic or personal study of its historical forms and methods was not a sufficient basis for gaining a correct understanding of it.&lt;ref name="Farouki"/&gt; In fact, an obsession with its traditional forms might actually become an obstacle: "Show a man too many camels' bones, or show them to him too often, and he will not be able to recognise a camel when he comes across a live one," is how he expressed this idea in one of his books.&lt;ref name="Farouki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dermis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=The Dermis Probe|publisher=Octagon Press|origyear=1970|year=1980|location=London, UK|page=18|isbn=0-86304-045-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah, like [[Inayat Khan]], presented Sufism as a path that transcended individual religions, and adapted it to a Western audience.&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smoley|first=Richard|author2=Kinney, Jay|title=Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions|publisher=Quest Books|year=2006|location=Wheaton, IL/Chennai, India|page=238|isbn=0-8356-0844-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Khan, however, he deemphasised religious or spiritual trappings and portrayed Sufism as a psychological technology, a method or science that could be used to achieve self-realisation.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deikman"/&gt; In doing so, his approach seemed to be especially addressed to followers of Gurdjieff, students of the [[Human Potential Movement]], and intellectuals acquainted with modern psychology.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; For example, he wrote, "Sufism ... states that man may become objective, and that objectivity enables the individual to grasp 'higher' facts. Man is therefore invited to push his evolution ahead towards what is sometimes called in Sufism 'real intellect'."&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt; Shah taught that the human being could acquire new subtle sense organs in response to need:&lt;ref name="Galin"/&gt;

{{quotation|Sufis believe that, expressed in one way, humanity is evolving towards a certain destiny. We are all taking part in that evolution. Organs come into being as a result of the need for specific organs ([[Rumi]]). The human being's organism is producing a new complex of organs in response to such a need. In this age of transcending of time and space, the complex of organs is concerned with the transcending of time and space. What ordinary people regard as sporadic and occasional outbursts of [[telepathy|telepathic]] or prophetic power are seen by the Sufi as nothing less than the first stirrings of these same organs. The difference  between all evolution up to date and the present need for evolution  is that for the past ten thousand years or so we have been given the possibility of a conscious evolution. So essential is this  more rarefied evolution that our future depends upon it.|Idries Shah, ''The Sufis''&lt;ref name="Sufis54"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=The Sufis|publisher=Octagon Press|origyear=1964|year=1977|location=London, UK|page=54|isbn=0-86304-020-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shah dismissed other Eastern and Western projections of Sufism as "watered down, generalised or partial"; he included in this not only Khan's version, but also the overtly Muslim forms of Sufism found in most Islamic countries. On the other hand, the writings of Shah's associates implied that he was the "Grand Sheikh of the Sufis" – a position of authority undercut by the failure of any other Sufis to acknowledge its existence.&lt;ref name="HW"/&gt;  Shah felt the best way to introduce Sufi wisdom in the West, while at the same time overcoming the problems of [[guru]]s and [[cult]]s, was to clarify the difference between a cult and an educational system, and to contribute to knowledge. In an interview, he explained,
"You must work within an educational pattern – not in the mumbo-jumbo area."&lt;ref name="New Psychology"/&gt; As part of this approach, he acted as Director of Studies at the ICR.&lt;ref name="New Psychology"&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Psychology|journal=The Courier|date=23 June 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also lectured on the study of Sufism in the West at the [[University of Sussex]] in 1966. This was later published as a monograph entitled ''Special Problems in the Study of Sufi Ideas.''&lt;ref name=Sussex&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|authorlink=Idries Shah|title=Special Problems in the Study of Sufi Ideas|publisher=Octagon Press|year=1974|location=London, UK|isbn=0-900860-21-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah later explained that Sufi activities were divided into different components or departments: "studies ''in'' Sufism", "studies ''of'' Sufism", and "studies ''for'' Sufism".&lt;ref name="Shahadvanced"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=An Advanced Psychology of the East|publisher=[[Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge|ISHK]]|year=1977|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D3ApJsE8yg|format=audio|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies ''for'' Sufism helped lead people towards Sufism and included the promotion of knowledge which might be lacking in the culture and needed to be restored and spread, such as an understanding of [[social conditioning]] and [[brainwashing]], the difference between the rational and intuitive modes of thought, and other activities so that people's minds could become more free and wide-ranging. Studies ''of'' Sufism included institutions and activities, such as lectures and seminars, which provided information about Sufism and acted as a cultural liaison between the Sufis and the public. Finally, Studies ''in'' Sufism referred to being in a Sufi school, carrying out those activities prescribed by the teacher as part of a training, and this could take many forms which did not necessarily fit into the preconceived notion of a "mystical school".&lt;ref name="Shahadvanced"/&gt;

Shah's Sufi aims and methodologies were also delineated in the "Declaration of the People of the Tradition" given at Coombe Springs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to making this announcement, to feeding into certain fields of thought certain ideas, and pointing out some of the factors surrounding this work, the projectors of this declaration have a practical task. This task is to locate individuals who have the capacity for obtaining the special knowledge of man which is available; to group them in a special, not haphazard, manner, so that each such group forms a harmonious organism; to do this in the right place at the right time; to provide an external and interior format with which to work, as well as a formulation of 'ideas' suitable to local conditions; to balance theory with practice.&lt;ref name="Bennett2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a BBC interview from 1971, Shah explained his contemporary, adaptive approach: "I am interested in making available in the West those aspects of Sufism which shall be of use to the West at this time. I don't want to turn good Europeans into poor Asiatics. People have asked me why I don't use traditional methods of spiritual training, for instance, in dealing with people who seek me out or hunt me down; and of course, the answer is, that it's for the same reason that you came to my house today in a motorcar and not on the back of a camel. Sufism is, in fact, not a mystical system, not a religion, but a body of knowledge."&lt;ref name=Lewin&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewin|first=Leonard|title=Diffusion of Sufi Ideas in the West|publisher=Keysign Press|year=1972|location=Boulder, CO|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah frequently characterised some of his work as really only preliminary to actual Sufi study, in the same way that learning to read and write might be seen as preliminary to a study of literature: "Unless the psychology is correctly oriented, there is no spirituality, though there can be obsession and emotionality, often mistaken for it."&lt;ref name="Wilson187-188"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Peter|editor=[[Peter B. Clarke]]|chapter=The Strange Fate of Sufism in the New Age|title=New Trends and Developments in the World of Islam|publisher=Luzac Oriental|year=1998|location=London, UK|pages=187–88|isbn=1-898942-17-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LHTL80"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=Learning How To Learn|publisher=Penguin Arkana|date=1978|location=New York, NY/London, UK/Ringwood, Victoria/Toronto, Canada/Auckland, NZ|page=80|isbn=0-14-019513-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Anyone trying to graft spiritual practices upon an unregenerate personality ... will end up with an aberration", he argued.&lt;ref name="Wilson187-188"/&gt; For this reason, most of the work he produced from ''The Sufis'' onwards was psychological in nature, focused on attacking the ''[[nafs|nafs-i-ammara]]'', the [[True self and false self|false self]]: "I have nothing to give you except the way to understand how to seek – but you think you can already do that."&lt;ref name="Wilson187-188"/&gt;

Shah was frequently criticised for not mentioning God very much in his writings; his reply was that given man's present state, there would not be much point in talking about God. He illustrated the problem in a parable in his book ''Thinkers of the East'': "Finding I could speak the language of ants, I approached one and inquired, 'What is God like? Does he resemble the ant?' He answered, 'God! No indeed – we have only a single sting but God, He has ''two''!'"&lt;ref name="Wilson187-188"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TOTE101"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=Thinkers of the East|publisher=Penguin Arkana|date=1972|location=New York, NY, US; London, UK; Ringwood, Victoria, Australia; Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Auckland, New Zealand|page=101|isbn=0-14-019251-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah and Ornstein met in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Westerlund53" /&gt; Realising that Ornstein could be an ideal partner in propagating his teachings, translating them into the idiom of [[psychotherapy]], Shah made him his deputy (''[[Caliph|khalifa]]'') in the United States.&lt;ref name="SW31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Westerlund53"/&gt; Ornstein's ''The Psychology of Consciousness'' (1972) was enthusiastically received by the academic psychology community, as it coincided with new interests in the field, such as the study of [[biofeedback]] and other techniques designed to achieve shifts in mood and awareness. Ornstein has published more books in the field over the years.&lt;ref name="Westerlund53"/&gt;

Philosopher of [[science]] and physicist [[Henri Bortoft]] used teaching tales from Shah's corpus as analogies of the habits of mind which prevented people from grasping the scientific method of Johann Wolfgang von [[Goethe]]. Bortoft's ''The Wholeness of Nature: Goethe's Way of Science'' includes tales from ''[[Tales of the Dervishes]]'', ''The Exploits of the Incomparable Mullah Nasruddin'' and ''[[A Perfumed Scorpion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bortoft, ''The Wholeness of Nature: Goethe's Way of Science'' (1996). Floris Books; {{ISBN|0-86315-238-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their original historical and cultural setting, Sufi teaching stories of the kind popularised by Shah – first told orally, and later written down for the purpose of transmitting Sufi faith and practice to successive generations – were considered suitable for people of all ages, including children, as they contained multiple layers of meaning.&lt;ref name="Galin" /&gt; Shah likened the Sufi story to a peach: "A person may be emotionally stirred by the exterior as if the peach were lent to you. You can eat the peach and taste a further delight ... You can throw away the stone – or crack it and find a delicious kernel within. This is the hidden depth."&lt;ref name="Galin" /&gt; It was in this manner that Shah invited his audience to receive the Sufi story.&lt;ref name="Galin" /&gt; By failing to uncover the kernel, and regarding the story as merely amusing or superficial, a person  would accomplish nothing more than looking at the peach, while others internalised the tale and allowed themselves to be touched by it.&lt;ref name="Galin" /&gt;

Tahir Shah mentions his father's storytelling at several points throughout his 2008 book ''In Arabian Nights'', first to discuss how Idries Shah made use of teaching stories:  "My father never told us how the stories worked. He did not reveal the layers, the nuggets of information, the fragments of truth and fantasy. He didn't need to – because, given the right conditions, the stories activated, sowing themselves."&lt;ref name=IAN&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Tahir|title=In Arabian Nights|year=2008|publisher=Bantam Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-553-80523-9|pages=10, 15, 24, 262}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then explains how his father used these stories to impart wisdom: "My father always had a tale at hand to divert our attention, or to use as a way of transmitting an idea or a thought. He used to say that the great collections of stories from the East were like encyclopedias, storehouses of wisdom and knowledge ready to be studied, to be appreciated and cherished. To him, stories represented much more than mere entertainment. He saw them as complex psychological documents, forming a body of knowledge that had been collected and refined since the dawn of humanity and, more often than not, passed down by word of mouth."&lt;ref name=IAN /&gt;

Later on in the book, he continues his discussion of stories as teaching tools, quoting the following explanation his father gave him at the end of a story:
{{Quotation|These stories are technical documents, they are like maps, or kind of blueprints. What I do is show people how to use the maps, because they have forgotten. You may think it's a strange way to teach – with stories – but long ago this was the way people passed on wisdom. Everyone knew how to take the wisdom from the story. They could see through the layers, in the same way you see a fish frozen in a block of ice. But the world where we are living has lost this skill, a skill they certainly once had. They hear the stories and they like them, because the stories amuse them, make them feel warm. But they can't see past the first layer, into the ice.

The stories are like a lovely chessboard: we all know how to play chess and we can be drawn into a game so complicated that our faculties are drained. But imagine if the game was lost from a society for centuries and then the fine chessboard and its pieces were found. Everyone would cluster round to see them and praise them. They might never imagine that such a fine object ever had a purpose other than to entertain the eyes. The stories' inner value has been lost in the same way. At one time everyone knew how to play with them, how to decipher them. But now the rules have been forgotten. It is for us to show people again how the game is played.|Tahir Shah|In Arabian Nights|&lt;ref name=IAN /&gt;}}

[[Olav Hammer]], in ''Sufism in Europe and North America'' (2004), cites an example of such a story.&lt;ref name="Hammer" /&gt; It tells of a man who is looking for his key on the ground.&lt;ref name="Hammer" /&gt; When a passing neighbour asks the man whether this is in fact the place where he lost the key, the man replies, "No, I lost it at home, but there is more light here than in my own house.".&lt;ref name="Hammer"&gt;{{cite book

This is an example of the long-noted phenomenon of similar tales existing in many different cultures, which was a central idea in Shah's folktale collection ''[[World Tales]]''.

Peter Wilson, writing in ''New Trends and Developments in the World of Islam'' (1998), quotes another such story, featuring a [[dervish]] who is asked to describe the qualities of his teacher, Alim.&lt;ref name="Wilson185"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then he proceeds to list the qualities which actually enabled Alim to be an effective teacher: "Hazrat Alim Azimi made me irritated, which caused me to examine my irritation, to trace its source. Alim Azimi made me angry, so that I could feel and transform my anger."&lt;ref name="Dermis21" /&gt; He explains that Alim Azimi followed the [[path of blame]], intentionally provoking vicious attacks upon himself, in order to bring the failings of both his students and critics to light, allowing them to be seen for what they really were: "He showed us the strange, so that the strange became commonplace and we could realise what it really is."&lt;ref name="Wilson185"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dermis21"/&gt;

Shah's concern was to reveal essentials underlying all cultures, and the hidden factors determining individual behaviour.&lt;ref name="Makers"/&gt; He discounted the Western focus on appearances and superficialities, which often reflected mere fashion and habit, and drew attention to the origins of culture and the unconscious and mixed motivations of people and the groups formed by them. He pointed out how both on the individual and group levels, short-term disasters often turn into blessings – and vice versa – and yet the knowledge of this has done little to affect the way people respond to events as they occur.&lt;ref name="Makers"/&gt;

Shah did not advocate the abandonment of worldly duties; instead, he argued that the treasure sought by the would-be disciple should derive from one's struggles in everyday living. He considered practical work the means through which a seeker could do self-work, in line with the traditional adoption by Sufis of ordinary professions, through which they earned their livelihoods and "worked" on themselves.&lt;ref name="Galin"/&gt;

Shah's status as a teacher remained indefinable; disclaiming both the [[guru]] identity and any desire to found a [[cult]] or [[sect]], he also rejected the academic hat.&lt;ref name="Makers" /&gt; Michael Rubinstein, writing in ''Makers of Modern Culture'', concluded that "he is perhaps best seen as an embodiment of the tradition in which the contemplative and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] aspects of the mind are regarded as being most productive when working together."&lt;ref name="Makers"/&gt;

===Legacy===
Idries Shah considered his books his legacy; in themselves, they would fulfil the function he had fulfilled when he could no longer be there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Tahir|authorlink=Tahir Shah|title=In Arabian Nights: A Caravan of Moroccan Dreams|publisher=Bantam|year=2008|location=New York, NY|pages=215–16|isbn=0-553-80523-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoting and distributing their teacher's publications has been an important activity or "work" for Shah's students, both for fund-raising purposes and for transforming public awareness.&lt;ref name="SW32"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malik|first=Jamal|author2=Hinnells, John R.

When Elizabeth Hall interviewed Shah for ''[[Psychology Today]]'' in July 1975, she asked him: "For the sake of humanity, what would you like to see happen?" Shah replied: "What I would really want, in case anybody is listening, is for the products of the last 50 years of psychological research to be studied by the public, by everybody, so that the findings become part of their way of thinking (...) they have this great body of psychological information and refuse to use it."&lt;ref name="Hall 61"/&gt;

Shah's brother, [[Omar Ali-Shah]] (1922–2005), was also a writer and teacher of Sufism; the brothers taught students together for a while in the 1960s, but in 1977 "agreed to disagree" and went their separate ways.&lt;ref name="Hayter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayter|first=Augy|title=Fictions and Factions|publisher=Tractus Books|year=2002|location=Reno, NV/Paris, France|pages=177, 201|isbn=2-909347-14-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Idries Shah's death in&amp;nbsp;1996, a fair number of his students became affiliated with Omar Ali-Shah's movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malik|first=Jamal|author2=Hinnells, John R.

==Reception==
Shah's books on Sufism achieved considerable critical acclaim. He was the subject of a [[BBC]] documentary ("One Pair of Eyes") in&amp;nbsp;1969,&lt;ref name=MENA/&gt; and two of his works (''[[The Way of the Sufi]]'' and ''Reflections'') were chosen as "Outstanding Book of the Year" by the [[BBC]]'s "The Critics" programme.&lt;ref name="DLES"&gt;{{cite news

A collection of positive assessments of Shah's work entitled ''Sufi Studies: East and West'' was published in 1973 which included, among others, contributions from L. F. Rushbrook Williams, [[Rom Landau]], [[Mohammad Hidayatullah]], [[Gyula Germanus]], [[Sir John Glubb]], Sir [[Razik Fareed]], [[Ishtiaq Hussain Qureshi]], [[Ahmet Emin Yalman]], Mahmoud Youssef Shawarbi and Nasrollah S.

[[Colin Wilson]] stated that "partly through Idries Shah, I have begun to see some rather new and interesting implications [about the subject of mysticism]"&lt;ref&gt;''The Nature of Religious Man'', edited by D.B. Fry, Octagon Press, London, 1982, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; and in his review of ''[[The Magic Monastery]]'' (1972) noted that Shah "is not primarily concerned with propagating some secret doctrine. He is concerned with the method by which mystical knowledge is transmitted... [The Sufis] transmit knowledge through direct intuition rather in the manner of the Zen masters, and one of the chief means of doing this is by means of brief stories and parables which work their way into the subconscious and activate its hidden forces."&lt;ref&gt;"Worlds of Magic", in ''Books and Bookmen'', June 1972, vol 17, no. 9, issue #201.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Afghanistan, the ''[[Kabul Times]]'' said that ''Caravan of Dreams'' (1968) was "highly recommended" and "of especial interest to Afghans" because it is "basically an anthology of short stories, tales and proverbs, jokes and extracts, from the written and oral literature which forms a part of many an evening's talk and interchange – even in these modern times – in Afghanistan."&lt;ref&gt;Kabul Times, 13 May 1973, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Afghanistan News'' reported that ''The Sufis'' "covers important Afghan contributions to world philosophy and science" and was "the first {{sic|?|hide=y|fully|-}}authoritative book on Sufism and the human development system of the dervishes." &lt;ref&gt;The Afghanistan News, May 1964, vol 7, no. 81&lt;/ref&gt; As far as doubts about Shah's background and credentials are concerned, the [[Sardar Haji Faiz Muhammad Khan Zikeria]], an Afghan scholar who had served as Afghan Minister of Education and later Ambassador and Foreign Minister of Afghanistan, issued a notarized Declaration for the scholars of the world about the Shah family in 1970: "The Musavi Saiyids of Afghanistan and Khans of Paghman are recognized as the descendants of the Prophet – may peace be upon him. They are recognized to be of the most noble descent of Islam and are respected as Sufi teachers and erudite scholars. Saiyid Idries Shah, son of the late Saiyid Ikbal Ali Shah, is personally known to me as an honourable man whose rank, titles and descent are attested and known by repute."&lt;ref&gt;"Spirituality, Science and Psychology in the Sufi Way" in Sufi Studies: East and West, edited by Professor L.F. Rushbrook Williams, E.P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1974, p. 116&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Professor [[Khalilullah Khalili]], former Poet Laureate of Afghanistan, praised the work of his "compatriot and friend the ''Arif'' (Sufi Illuminate) The Sayed Idries Shah", saying "Especially to be appreciated are his brilliant and important services in revealing the celestial inspirations and inner thoughts of the great teachers of Islam and Sufis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.octagonpress.com/titles/LI/qukhpage02.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602033731/http://www.octagonpress.com/titles/LI/qukhpage02.htm |archivedate=2 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Hindustan Standard]]'' of India found that ''Caravan of Dreams'', was a "fine anthology, dippable-into at any time for entertainment, refreshment, consolation, and inspiration... witty, engrossing, utterly and appealingly human."&lt;ref&gt;"Oriental Wisdom" in ''Hindustan Standard'', 4 January 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Institute for Cross-cultural Exchange]] (ICE), a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Charitable organization|charity]] founded in 2004, decided to use Idries Shah's children's books to distribute to thousands of needy children in Canada, [[Mexico]] and Afghanistan, as part of their children's [[literacy]] programme and promotion of [[cross-cultural]] understanding.

==="Shah-school" writings===
A hostile critic was [[James Moore (Cornish author)|James Moore]], a Gurdjieffian who disagreed with Shah's assertion that [[Gurdjieff]]'s teaching was essentially sufic in nature and took exception to the publication of a chronologically impossible, pseudonymous book on the matter (''[[The Teachers of Gurdjieff]]'' by Rafael Lefort) that was linked to Shah.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; In a 1986 article in ''[[Religion Today]]'' (now the ''[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]''), Moore covered the Bennett and Graves controversies and noted that Shah was surrounded by a "nimbus of exorbitant adulation: an adulation he himself has fanned".&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;!--; the [http://www.jamesmoore.org.uk/7.htm author's website] features a link, ''Pseudo-Sufism: the case of Idries Shah'', to an [http://www.geocities.com/metaco8nitron/moore.html online copy] of the paper--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He described Shah as supported by a "coterie of serviceable journalists, editors, critics, animators, broadcasters, and travel writers, which gamely choruses Shah's praise".&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; Moore questioned Shah's purported Sufi heritage and upbringing and deplored the body of pseudonymous "Shah-school" writings from such authors as "Omar Michael Burke Ph. D." and "Hadrat B. M. Dervish", who from 1960 heaped intemperate praise – ostensibly from disinterested parties – on Shah, referring to him as the "Tariqa Grand Sheikh Idries Shah Saheb", "Prince Idries Shah", "King Enoch", "The Presence", "The Studious King", the "Incarnation of Ali", and even the [[Qutub (Sufism)|Qutb]] or "Axis" – all in support of Shah's incipient efforts to market Sufism to a Western audience.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

Peter Wilson similarly commented on the "very poor quality" of much that had been written in Shah's support, noting an "unfortunately fulsome style", claims that Shah possessed various [[paranormal]] abilities, "a tone of superiority; an attitude, sometimes smug, condescending, or pitying, towards those 'on the outside', and the apparent absence of any motivation to substantiate claims which might be thought to merit such treatment".&lt;ref name="Wilson189-191" /&gt; In his view, there was a "marked difference in quality between Shah's own writings" and the quality of this secondary literature.&lt;ref name="Wilson189-191"&gt;{{cite book

Arguing for an alternative interpretation of this literature, the religious scholar Andrew Rawlinson proposed that rather than a "transparently self-serving [...] deception", it may have been a "masquerade – something that by definition has to be seen through".&lt;ref name="Rawlinson525"/&gt; Stating that "a critique of entrenched positions cannot itself be fixed and doctrinal", and noting that Shah's intent had always been to undermine false certainties, he argued that the "Shah myth" created by these writings may have been a teaching tool, rather than a tool of concealment; something "made to be deconstructed – that is ''supposed'' to dissolve when you touch it".&lt;ref name="Rawlinson525"&gt;{{cite book

===Assessment===
[[File:Doris lessing 20060312 (jha).jpg|thumb|right|260px|Nobel-prize winner [[Doris Lessing]] was profoundly influenced by Shah.]]
Doris Lessing, one of Shah's greatest defenders,&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; stated in a 1981 interview: "I found Sufism as taught by Idries Shah, which claims to be the reintroduction of an ancient teaching, suitable for this time and this place. It is not some regurgitated stuff from the East or watered-down Islam or anything like that."&lt;ref name="Galin"/&gt; In 1996, commenting on Shah's death in ''The Daily Telegraph'', she stated that she met Shah because of ''[[The Sufis]]'', which was to her the most surprising book she had read, and a book that changed her life.&lt;ref name="Lessingon"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessing|first=Doris|authorlink=Doris Lessing|title=On the Death of Idries Shah|work=dorislessing.org|url=http://www.dorislessing.org/on.html|accessdate=3 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing Shah's œuvre as a "phenomenon like nothing else in our time", she characterised him as a many-sided man, the wittiest person she ever expected to meet, kind, generous, modest ("Don't look so much at my face, but take what is in my hand", she quotes him as saying), and her good friend and teacher for 30-odd years.&lt;ref name="Lessingon"/&gt;

[[Arthur J. Deikman]], a professor of [[psychiatry]] and long-time researcher in the area of [[meditation]] and change of consciousness who began his study of Sufi teaching stories in the early seventies, expressed the view that Western psychotherapists could benefit from the perspective provided by Sufism and its universal essence, provided suitable materials were studied in the correct manner and sequence.&lt;ref name="Deikman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boorstein|first=Seymour (ed.)|title=Transpersonal Psychotherapy|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1996|location=Albany, NY|pages=241, 247|isbn=0-7914-2835-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Shah's writings and translations of Sufi teaching stories were designed with that purpose in mind, he recommended them to those interested in assessing the matter for themselves, and noted that many authorities had accepted Shah's position as a spokesman for contemporary Sufism.&lt;ref name="Deikman"/&gt; The psychologist and consciousness researcher [[Charles Tart]] commented that Shah's writings had "produced a more profound appreciation in [him] of what psychology is about than anything else ever written".&lt;ref name="Wilson195"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Peter|editor=[[Peter B.

Asked to give an assessment of Shah in 1973, [[J.G. Bennett]] said that Shah was doing important work on a large scale, "stirring people up very effectively all over the place, making them think, showing them that modes of thought that appear to be free are really largely conditioned." He referred to Shah as the [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti]] of Sufism, breaking down people's fixed ideas in many directions as part of an awakening process that is "a very necessary preparation for the new world."&lt;ref name="BennettTalk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennett|first=J.G.|title=Gurdjieff: Making a New World|publisher=Bennett Books|date=23 November 1973|url=http://www.bennettbooks.org/store/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=BB&amp;Product_Code=CDPT2-BL&amp;Category_Code=110|format=audio cd|accessdate=17 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402140546/http://www.bennettbooks.org/store/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=BB&amp;Product_Code=CDPT2-BL&amp;Category_Code=110|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian philosopher and mystic [[Rajneesh]], later known as Osho, commenting on Shah's work, described ''The Sufis'' as "just a diamond. The value of what he has done in ''The Sufis'' is immeasurable". He added that Shah was "the man who introduced Mulla Nasrudin to the West, and he has done an incredible service. He cannot be repaid. [...] Idries Shah has made just the small anecdotes of Nasrudin even more beautiful ... [he] not only has the capacity to exactly translate the parables, but even to beautify them, to make them more poignant, sharper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osho|authorlink=Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|title=Books I Have Loved|publisher=Tao Publishing Pvt. Ltd|year=2005|location=Pune, India|pages=127–28|isbn=81-7261-102-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Smoley]] and [[Jay Kinney]], writing in ''Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions'' (2006), pronounced Shah's ''The Sufis'' an "extremely readable and wide-ranging introduction to Sufism", adding that "Shah's own slant is evident throughout, and some historical assertions are debatable (none are footnoted), but no other book is as successful as this one in provoking interest in Sufism for the general reader."&lt;ref name="HW250-251"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smoley|first=Richard|author2=Kinney, Jay|title=Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions|publisher=Quest Books|year=2006|location=Wheaton, IL/Chennai, India|pages=250–51|isbn=0-8356-0844-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They described ''Learning How to Learn'', a collection of interviews, talks and short writings, as one of Shah's best works, providing a solid orientation to his "psychological" approach to Sufi work, noting that at his best, "Shah provides insights that inoculate students against much of the nonsense in the spiritual marketplace."&lt;ref name="HW250-251"/&gt;

[[Human Givens|Ivan Tyrrell]] and social psychologist [[Human Givens|Joe Griffin]], in their book about innate emotional needs, ''Human Givens: A new approach to emotional health and clear thinking'', wrote that Shah "more than anyone else, understood and appreciated the real significance of the givens of human nature".&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, J; Tyrrell, I. (2004) ''Human Givens: A new approach to emotional health and clear thinking.'' HG Publishing.{{ISBN|1-899398-31-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another book, ''Godhead: The Brain's Big Bang – The explosive origin of creativity, mysticism and mental illness'', they said that Shah's stories, "when told to young and old alike [...] lay down blueprints in the mind, not only for living and overcoming everyday difficulties but also for travelling the spiritual path. Their impact may not be recognized or felt for months or years after first hearing or reading them, but eventually the structural content they contain will exploit the pattern-matching nature of the brain and make it possible for students to observe the functioning of their own emotionally conditioned responses to changing life circumstances. It then makes it easier for them to take any action required by reality, and for their minds to connect to higher realms. Teaching stories should be read, told and reflected on, but not intellectually analysed, because that destroys the beneficial impact that they would otherwise have had on your mind." Shah, they added, was "a great collector and publisher of tales and writings that contain this 'long-term impact' quality. He understood the vital importance for humanity of the 'mental blueprint' aspect of them and his books are full of nourishing examples."&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, J; Tyrrell, I. (2011) ''Godhead: The Brain's Big Bang – The explosive origin of creativity, mysticism and mental illness''.; {{ISBN|978-1-899398-27-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olav Hammer notes that during Shah's last years, when the generosity of admirers had made him truly wealthy, and he had become a respected figure among the higher echelons of British society, controversies arose due to discrepancies between autobiographical data – mentioning kinship with the prophet [[Muhammad]], affiliations with a secret Sufi order in [[Central Asia]], or the tradition in which Gurdjieff was taught – and recoverable historical facts.&lt;ref name="Hammer"/&gt; While there may have been a link of kinship with the prophet [[Muhammad]], the number of people sharing such a link today, 1300 years later, would be at least one million. Other elements of Shah's autobiography appeared to have been pure fiction. Even so, Hammer noted that Shah's books have remained in public demand, and that he has played "a significant role in representing the essence of Sufism as a non-confessional, individualistic and life-affirming distillation of spiritual wisdom."&lt;ref name="Hammer"/&gt;

Peter Wilson wrote that if Shah had been a swindler, he had been an "extremely gifted one", because unlike merely commercial writers, he had taken the time to produce an elaborate and internally consistent system that attracted a "whole range of more or less eminent people", and had "provoked and stimulated thought in many diverse quarters".&lt;ref name="Wilson195"/&gt; Moore acknowledged that Shah had made a contribution of sorts in popularising a [[humanism|humanistic]] Sufism, and had "brought energy and resource to his self-aggrandisement", but ended with the damning conclusion that Shah's was "a 'Sufism' without self-sacrifice, without self-transcendence, without the aspiration of [[gnosis]], without tradition, without the Prophet, without the [[Qur'an]], without Islam, and without God. Merely that."&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farouki"/&gt;

[[Gore Vidal]] opined that Shah's "books are a great deal harder to read than they were to write."&lt;ref name="Hitchens"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Hitchens|title=Arguably|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2f9ECP49MLIC&amp;pg=PT61|accessdate=2 September 2012|publisher=Atlantic Books|isbn=978-0-85789-257-7|page=61|date=2011-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Sufis'' controversy====
The reception of Shah's movement was also marked by controversy.&lt;ref name="Galin" /&gt; Some orientalists were hostile, in part because Shah presented classical Sufi writings as tools for self-development to be used by contemporary people, rather than as objects of historical study.&lt;ref name="OISTI"&gt;{{cite news

Graves' introduction to ''The Sufis'', written with Shah's help, described Shah as being "in the senior male line of descent from the [[prophet Mohammed]]" and as having inherited "secret mysteries from the [[Caliphs]], his ancestors. He is, in fact, a Grand Sheikh of the Sufi ''[[Tariqa]]''...

And Shah's fiercest critic, University of Edinburgh scholar [[L.P. Elwell-Sutton]], in a 1975 article critical of what he called "pseudo-Sufis" like [[Gurdjieff]] and Shah, opined that Graves had been trying to "upgrade" Shah's "rather undistinguished lineage", and that the reference to Mohammed's senior male line of descent was a "rather unfortunate gaffe", as Mohammed's sons had all died in infancy. Although Elwell-Sutton accepted that the family were [[Sayyid]]s descended from the seventh [[Imam]] [[Musa al-Kadhim]], the great-greatgrandson of [[Hussein ibn Ali]], who was the younger son of the marriage of [[Fatimah]] (the daughter of the Prophet) and [[Ali|Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib]], he considered this an "undistinguished lineage" with no special sanctity because "Sayyids proliferate throughout the Islamic world, in all walks of society and on both sides of every religious and political fence."&lt;ref name="Elwell14"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elwell-Sutton|first=L.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took a dim view of Rushbrook Williams' ''[[festschrift]]'' (collection written in honour of) Shah, saying he considered many of the claims made in the book on behalf of Shah and his father, concerning their representing the Sufi tradition, to be self-serving publicity marked by a "disarming disregard for facts".&lt;ref name="RWreview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elwell-Sutton|first=L.

P.|date=May 1975|title=Sufism &amp; Pseudo-Sufism|journal=Encounter|volume=XLIV|issue=5|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Omar Khayyam controversy====
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Shah came under attack over a controversy surrounding the [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam#Robert Graves and Omar Ali-Shah|1967 publication of a new translation]] of [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat]], by Robert Graves and Shah's older brother, [[Omar Ali-Shah]].&lt;ref name="OISTI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DLES"/&gt; The translation, which presented the Rubaiyat as a Sufi poem, was based on an annotated "[[Crib sheet|crib]]", supposedly derived from a manuscript that had been in the Shah family's possession for 800&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="eagle"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844564,00.html|title=Stuffed Eagle at|work=time.com|accessdate=5 November 2008|last=Robert Graves|first=Omar Ali-Shah| date=31 May 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; L. P. Elwell-Sutton, an orientalist at [[Edinburgh University]], and others who reviewed the book expressed their conviction that the story of the ancient manuscript was false.&lt;ref name="DLES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eagle"/&gt;

Shah's father, the Sirdar [[Ikbal Ali Shah]], was expected by Graves to present the original manuscript to clear the matter up, but he died in a car accident in [[Tangier]] in November 1969.&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt; A year later, Graves asked Idries Shah to produce the manuscript. Shah replied in a letter that the manuscript was not in his possession, but even if it were, producing it would prove nothing, because it could not be accurately dated using the current methods and its authenticity would still be contested.&lt;ref name="Graves" /&gt; It was time, Shah wrote, "that we realised that the hyenas who are making so much noise are intent only on opposition, destructiveness and carrying on a campaign when, let's face it, nobody is really listening."&lt;ref name="Graves" /&gt; He added that his father had been so infuriated by those casting these aspersions that he refused to engage with them, and he felt his father's response had been correct.&lt;ref name="Graves" /&gt; Graves, noting that he was now widely perceived as having fallen prey to the Shah brothers' gross deception, and that this affected income from sales of his other historical writings, insisted that producing the manuscript had become "a matter of family honour".&lt;ref name="Graves" /&gt; He pressed Shah again, reminding him of previous promises to produce the manuscript if it were necessary.&lt;ref name="Graves" /&gt;

Neither of the brothers ever produced the manuscript, leading Graves' nephew and biographer to muse that it was hard to believe – bearing in mind the Shah brothers' many obligations to Graves – that they would have withheld the manuscript if it had ever existed in the first place.&lt;ref name="Graves"&gt;{{cite book

'''Iosif Chișinevschi''' (1905–1963), born '''Iosif Roitman''', was a [[Romania]]n [[Communism|communist]] politician. The leading [[Ideology|ideologue]] of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) from 1944 to 1957, he served as head of its [[Agitprop]] Department from 1948 to 1952 and was in charge of [[propaganda]] and culture from 1952 to 1955. He has been described as "[[Soviet Union|Moscow]]'s right-hand man in Romania".&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu 2003, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Chișinevschi was born to a [[Poverty|poor]] [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] family in [[Bassarabia]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Largely self-taught and a high-school [[Dropping out|dropout]], he joined the PCR in 1928. Arrested that year (since the PCR had been banned in 1924), he went to the [[Soviet Union]] upon his release in 1930. He attended the [[Comintern]]'s [[International Lenin School]] (his only ideological training) and was a participant at the Vth PCR Congress, held in [[Gorikovo]] near [[Moscow]] in December 1931. The Comintern delegates to the congress, [[Béla Kun]] and [[Dmitry Manuilsky]], sponsored his election to the PCR central committee. He had personal connections within the Soviet secret police, of which he was an agent (which he remained through the 1950s), infiltrating the PCR hierarchy’s upper ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu 2003, p. 159. (He was already a party member, but the infiltration took the form of a Bolshevisation meant to ensure obedience to Moscow's line.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chișinevschi came back to Romania with instructions from Moscow, helping to reorganize the Agitprop Department, the PCR’s propaganda nucleus. During the party's years of [[Resistance movement|underground]] activity, he helped orient it toward [[Bolshevism]] (specifically [[Stalinism]]). He shunned real intellectual problems and the debates of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] left, instead idolizing [[Joseph Stalin]]. He was most influenced by the latter’s ''The Problems of Leninism'', a sort of thumbnail sketch of revolutionary theory; once he had read the ''History of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (Bolsheviks) Short Course'', with its blatant falsifications, he looked no further than Stalin for ideological guidance. A devoted Comintern man, he was unconcerned with Romania’s cultural and political history and context.

Arrested again in 1933, he was freed in 1936 and integrated into the secretariat of the Central Committee, becoming head of the [[Bucharest]] party organization.&lt;ref name="Tismăneanu 2003, p. 159"&gt;Tismăneanu 2003, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In power===
Reconfirmed as a member of the PCR Central Committee in 1940, he was arrested that year, spending [[World War II]] in the [[Caransebeş]] penitentiary and the [[Târgu Jiu]] camp, where he was among the closest associates of [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], especially after 1942. Having navigated for several years between the party’s Gheorghiu-Dej and [[Ştefan Foriş|Ștefan Foriș]], he participated in the staging of a plot that resulted in the latter’s elimination and assassination,&lt;ref name="Tismăneanu 2003, p. 159"/&gt; accusing him of being a collaborator of the [[Kingdom of Romania]]'s secret police, [[Siguranţa Statului|Siguranța Statului]].&lt;ref&gt;Arvatu.&lt;/ref&gt; Joining the Politburo after August 23, 1944, he participated in the anti-intelligentsia campaign, also publishing several articles and brochures under the pen name of Stănciulescu the following year. Between 1952 and 1954, he was intimately involved in the shadowy machinations that led to the downfall of [[Ana Pauker]], the execution of [[Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu|Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu]], and the trial of [[Vasile Luca]].

Despite his Jewish ethnicity, Chișinevschi frantically distanced himself from his origins and helped persecute [[Jew]]s. For instance, on January 14, 1953, he wrote: "The Jewish communities have always been a nest of thieves, of spies. The communities have always had [[Wilhelm Filderman|Filderman]] and from the exploitation and robbing of poor people, to acts of criminal espionage, these have been part of their agenda. This is why I think we have to proceed firmly. The devil take them—they will eventually be quiet; otherwise they will damage us, and not only us, but the entire camp of peace".&lt;ref&gt;Wexler.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chişinevschi, known among party members as Ioșka, was a consummate intriguer and opportunist, sycophantically subservient to his superiors, vindictive, and despotic toward his subordinates. He was the patron of an entire group of crude, narrow-minded and aggressive apparatchiks who dominated Romania's spiritual life during the years of unrestrained Stalinism. As a committed Stalinist, he was unconditionally devoted to the USSR and identified his own destiny with that of the "homeland of socialism". He participated in all the important meetings with Soviet representatives and delegates from other Eastern European countries, also coordinating the party’s international relations and supervising cadre policy.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu 2003, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downfall===
For Chișinevschi, one’s attitude toward the USSR was his most important criterion of Leninist orthodoxy. Thus, when the Soviets changed course at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress]] (which Chișinevschi attended), he zealously changed course and immediately began spreading insidious critical allusions about his old friend Gheorghiu-Dej, hoping to cover up his own past crimes and abuses. At the March 1956 plenary, he and [[Miron Constantinescu]] called for a liberalisation, something that Gheorghiu-Dej categorically rejected. He did not make his proposal out of genuinely reformist sentiments, but rather because "his enduring opportunism, his unsurpassed chameleon-type of political conduct materialized in his will to associate himself with the group that was most probable to win the battle". As "a true follower of Moscow’s line, whatever its twist or turn, he grasped an opportunity to undermine Gheorghiu-Dej and re-compose for himself the image of a fighter for intra-party democracy". Thinking that "a critical re-assessment of the Stalinist purges in Romania was inevitable", he aligned himself in opposition to Gheorghiu-Dej.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu 2002, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably encouraged by [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]], Chișinevschi and Constantinescu sought allies on the Politburo to topple Gheorghiu-Dej by majority vote; they drew [[Constantin Pîrvulescu]], president of the party control commission to their side, but failed to capture [[Alexandru Moghioroş|Alexandru Moghioroș]], who informed Gheorghiu-Dej of the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu 2003, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, despite renewed professions of faith in Gheorghiu-Dej, Chişinevschi had no chance of political survival, as the former surpassed him in ability and duplicity. During the June 28–29 and July 1–3, 1957 plenum of the Central Committee, the Chişinevschi-Constantinescu "factionalist group" (invented by Gheorghiu-Dej for propaganda purposes) was purged from the Politburo. In June 1960, the Third Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party (as the PCR was then called) did not re-elect him to the Central Committee.

In late 1956, knowing about his dissent from Gheorghiu-Dej's line that March, the leaders of the [[Bucharest student movement of 1956]] saw Chișinevschi, then vice president of the Council of Ministers, as a potential interlocutor, but he rebuffed their calls for dialogue.

At the November 30–December 5, 1961 central committee plenum, his former comrades cruelly humiliated him: Gheorghiu-Dej, [[Nicolae Ceauşescu|Nicolae Ceaușescu]], [[Ion Gheorghe Maurer]], [[Leonte Răutu]], [[Petre Borilă]], Moghioroș, [[Alexandru Sencovici]], [[Valter Roman]] did not hesitate to accuse the man formerly celebrated as the "brain of the party", now the director of the ''[[Casa Presei Libere|Casa Scînteii]]'' printing works. It was here that Gheorghiu-Dej, absolving himself of responsibility, denounced the alleged Pauker-Luca-Georgescu and Chișinevschi-Constantinescu factions as being responsible for Romania’s worst Stalinist excesses. When Chișinevschi died in 1963, no obituary appeared in Romania. In April 1968, Ceaușescu relished the opportunity to denounce him (along with Gheorghiu-Dej and [[Alexandru Drăghici]]) for Pătrășcanu’s execution.

'''Juliet Anne Prowse''' (September 25, 1936 – September 14, 1996) was a dancer, whose four-decade career included stage, television and film. She was raised in [[South Africa]], where her family emigrated after [[World War II]].

==Early life==
Prowse was born in [[Bombay]], [[British India]] to  South African parents and reared in South Africa. She began studying dance at the age of four. In her early twenties, she was dancing at a club in [[Paris]] when she was spotted by a talent agent and eventually signed to play the role of "Claudine" in the [[Walter Lang]] film ''[[Can-Can (film)|Can-Can]]'' (1960). She had already missed a few opportunities to go to [[Hollywood]] because she was under contract but eventually left a show in [[Spain]] in which she was starring to travel to the [[United States]] for this film.

==Career==
It was during the filming of ''Can-Can'' in 1959 that she captured the international spotlight. Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] visited the set of the film and after Prowse performed a rather saucy can-can for the Russian leader, he proclaimed her dance "immoral." The publicity brought Prowse considerable attention in the United States. From there, her career accelerated.&lt;ref name="immoral"&gt;{{cite web|work=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Juliet Prowse |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-480770/Juliet-Prowse |accessdate=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film and television===
Prowse met [[Frank Sinatra]] on the set of ''Can-Can''. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine did not rate the movie highly, but declared Prowse the best thing in it: "In fact, the only thing really worth seeing is Juliet Prowse, a young South African hoofer who puts some twinkle in the stub-toed choreography. And the only thing really worth hearing is the crack that Frank flips back at Juliet when she whips a redoubtable hip in his direction. "Don't point", he gasps. "It's rude."&lt;ref name="movie review"&gt;{{cite news|work=Time |title=New Pictures, movie review of Can-Can |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894827,00.html |accessdate=17 September 2007 |date=21 March 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would go on to appear with Sinatra and other notable guests such as [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Peter Lawford]], [[Hermione Gingold]], [[the Hi-Lo's]], [[Red Norvo]], [[Nelson Riddle]] and his orchestra on the 1959 ''Frank Sinatra Show''. She at times would sing in the chorus with other guests or Sinatra would sing to her.&lt;ref name="its alright with me"&gt;{{cite web|title=YouTube |work=The Frank Sinatra Show December 13, 1959 with Juliet Prowse |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB6A7gf1zZ4 |accessdate=17 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinatra invited Prowse to join him in Las Vegas, even though she was living with the actor [[Nico Minardos]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/ondemand/findingnico&lt;/ref&gt; Sinatra and Prowse announced their [[engagement]] in 1962. Soon afterwards they broke up, reportedly because Prowse wanted to concentrate on her career. Prowse later admitted, "I was as much flattered as I was in love. He (Sinatra) was a complex person, and after a few drinks he could be very difficult."&lt;ref name="The Guardian Obituary 1996"&gt;''The Guardian'' obituary, 16 September 1996, by Ronald Bergan&lt;/ref&gt;

Prowse co-starred alongside [[Elvis Presley]] in ''[[G.I. Blues]]'' (1960). During shooting of the film, they had a short and intense fling. "Elvis and I had an affair. ... We had a sexual attraction like two healthy young people, but he was already a victim of his fans. We always met in his room and never went out."&lt;ref name="The Guardian Obituary 1996"/&gt; Prowse also made a brief cameo appearance in the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] documentary film, ''[[Elvis: That's the Way It Is]]'' (1970) as an interviewed audience member about to attend Elvis Presley's opening night show at the [[Westgate Las Vegas Resort &amp; Casino|International Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] on August 10, 1970.

She starred with [[Denny Miller|Denny Scott Miller]] on her own [[NBC]] sitcom in the 1965-1966 season: ''[[Mona McCluskey]]'', which was produced by [[George Burns]]. The series was based on the idea that the couple, Mike and Mona McCluskey, would live on his military salary, rather than her lucrative earnings as an actress. Miller died on September 9, 2014.

Prowse also did other feature films, including ''[[The Fiercest Heart]]'' (1961) and ''[[Who Killed Teddy Bear?]]'' (1965) with [[Sal Mineo]] and [[Elaine Stritch]].

Although her film and television career did not make her as big a star as predicted, Prowse had a rather philosophical way of looking at it. "Things generally happen for the best. ... I never worry about what happens in my career, because I can always do something else."&lt;ref name="career"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Free Library |title=Juliet Prowse |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/JULIET+PROWSE,+59,+ACTRESS,+DANCER+IN+1960S+TELEVISION,+MOVIE...-a083967450 |accessdate=17 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prowse would later go on to headline successful [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] shows, commanding a very high salary. Stating that Las Vegas was the most demanding place she ever worked, she won ''Entertainer of the Year'' for the Vegas run of ''[[Sweet Charity]]''. She would later show off her famous dancer's legs in a series of lucrative nationwide commercials for a number of advertisers, including [[L'eggs]] hosiery and Mannington Flooring.

Prowse was the first guest to appear on an episode of ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.&lt;ref name="Muppet Show, The, Season One"&gt;Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc. 2005. Muppet Show, The, Season One. US: The Muppets Holding Company, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, she was mauled by an 80-pound [[leopard]] – twice. Once, while filming a scene for ''[[Circus of the Stars]]'' in 1987 and later that same year rehearsing a promotional stunt on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', when the same leopard attacked her. The later attack was more serious, requiring upwards of twenty stitches to reattach her ear.&lt;ref name="LA Times report on Leopard Attack"&gt;{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-03/local/me-26193_1_juliet-prowse |title=Juliet Prowse Bitten Again by Same Leopard |accessdate=21 February 2011 |date=3 December 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the mid-1980s and 1990s, Prowse hosted the ''Championship Ballroom Dance Competition'' on [[PBS]].

==Death==
In 1994, Prowse was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]]. In 1995, she went into remission and was well enough to tour with [[Mickey Rooney]] in ''[[Sugar Babies (musical)|Sugar Babies]]''. The cancer subsequently returned and she died on September 14, 1996, eleven days short of her 60th birthday.

Her ex-husband, television actor [[John McCook]], is the father of her only child, Seth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E4DB123AF936A2575AC0A960958260 ''New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogan''' (born July 16, 1947) is a  [[poet]], [[storytelling|storyteller]], [[academic]], [[playwright]], [[novelist]], [[environmentalist]] and writer of [[short stories]].&lt;ref name="McClinton-Temple"&gt;&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_HeSvlkGFl4C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=Linda+Hogan+(writer)&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hJ0QTrDlOIShtwfQuN3zDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Linda%20Hogan%20(writer)&amp;f=false| title=Encyclopedia of American Indian literature| authors=Jennifer McClinton-Temple, Alan R.

She is currently the [[Chickasaw Nation]]'s Writer in Residence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120710114943/http://www.chickasaw.net/docs/Womens_Conference_April_16.pdf "Dynamic Women of the Chickasaw Nation."] ''Chickasaw Nation.'' 16 April 2009 (retrieved 17 Dec 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; She now lives in [[Tishomingo, Oklahoma]].

==Early life==
Linda Hogan is [[Americans|American]], born July 16, 1947 in Denver, Colorado. Her father, Charles C. Henderson, is a Chickasaw from a recognized historical family.&lt;ref name="L_Hogan"&gt;[http://nativeamericanlit.com/files/Linda_Hogan.pdf "Linda Hogan." Native American Literature.] Accessed October 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Cleona Florine (Bower) Henderson was of white descent,&lt;ref name="McClinton-Temple"/&gt; Linda's uncle, Wesley Henderson, helped form the White Buffalo Council in Denver during the 1950s,  to help other Indian people coming to the city because of [[Indian Relocation Act of 1956|The Relocation Act]], which forcibly removed Indigenous peoples for work and other opportunities. He had a strong influence on her and she grew up relating strongly to both her Chickasaw family in Indian Territory (Oklahoma) and to a mixed Indian community in the Denver area. At other times, her family traveled because of her father's career in the U.S. military. Her family lived in Germany for three years. She descended from a family of storytellers who helped shape her writing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linda Hogan|url=http://nativeamericanlit.com/files/Linda_Hogan.pdf|website=Writers of the Native American Renaissance|publisher=Native American Lit|accessdate=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with being an author, Hogan is also an environmentalist who spent eight years volunteering at a wildlife rehabilitation center. Two out of those eight years were spent at veterinarian school and the other six were spent at Birds of Prey Rehabilitation Center in Colorado. The work was very physical so Hogan reached a point where she was no longer able to handle it. Now, she does good for animals by talking and writing about them&lt;ref name="Interview With Linda Hogan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=John|title=Interview With Linda Hogan|url=http://www.terrain.org/1999/interviews/linda-hogan/|website=Terrain.org A Journal of the Built and Natural Environments|publisher=terrain.org|accessdate=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan married Pat Hogan and had children, Sandra Dawn Protector and Tanya Thunder Horse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linda Hogan|url=http://nativeamericanlit.com/files/Linda_Hogan.pdf|website=Writers of the Native American Renaissance|publisher=Native American Lit|accessdate=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Hogan earned a Master of Arts (M. A.) degree from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1978 at the Colorado Springs campus. She then briefly moved to Maryland with her husband and later moved back to Colorado where she went to school in Boulder&lt;ref name="Interview With Linda Hogan"/&gt; Her first university teaching position was at [[Colorado College]] in 1980-1984, the next was in American Indian Studies and American Studies at the [[University of Minnesota]] in Minneapolis (1982-1984).&lt;ref name="L_Hogan"/&gt; Hogan started writing in her late twenties after working with orthopedically handicapped children. During her lunch hours, she would read Kenneth Rexroth's work, which gave her the confidence to start writing publicly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linda Hogan|url=http://nativeamericanlit.com/files/Linda_Hogan.pdf|website=Writers of the Native American Renaissance|publisher=Native American Lit|accessdate=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; She kept a journal that she wrote in religiously. As she began to write essays and fiction, she realized that the energy she put into writing in a journal, had a new outlet. As she journaled, she also discovered that she was writing about the beauty of nature every morning and she believed she could do more for nature in less private writing settings&lt;ref name="Interview With Linda Hogan"/&gt; After writing her first book, ''Calling Myself Home'', she continued to write poetry.  Her work has both a historical and political focus, but is lyrical. Hogan's lyrical work is considered to have a voice of literary activism and in it is Native spirituality and indigenous knowledge systems of all genres&lt;ref name="Linda Hogan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hogan|first1=Linda|title=Linda Hogan|url=http://www.lindahoganwriter.com/index.htm|website=Linda Hogan Writer|publisher=lindahoganwriter.com|accessdate=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; She considers her work politically centered because it is about a world view that cannot be separated from the political.&lt;ref name="Interview With Linda Hogan"/&gt; Her most recent books are ''The Book of Medicines'' (1993) and ''Rounding the Human Corners.'' (2008) and a book of new and selected poetry containing work from the 1970s until 2014. Published in 2015.Hogan also has worked with Brenda Peterson in writing, Sightings, the Mysterious Journey of the Gray Whale for National Geographic books. She also wrote the script for the PBS documentary, Everything Has a Spirit, regarding Native American religious freedom.&lt;ref name="Linda Hogan"/&gt;

She is also a novelist and essayist. Her work centers on the world of native peoples, the environment, and from  her own indigenous perspective. She is currently known by students of ecological literature and eco-poetics. She was a full professor of Creative Writing at the [[University of Colorado]] and then taught for two years in the University's Ethnic Studies Department. Her most recent teaching has been as Writer in Residence for The Chickasaw Nation for six years, and a faculty position at the Indian Arts Institute in Santa Fe.

Hogan has published works in many different backgrounds and forms. Her concentration is on environmental themes as well Southeastern tribal histories and indigenous spirits and culture.&lt;ref name="Linda Hogan"/&gt; She has acted as a consultant in bringing together Native tribal representatives and feminist themes, particularly allying them to her native ancestry. She strives to balance the perception of male and female power in Native American culture that was disrupted by the effects of the early Christian Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linda Hogan|url=http://nativeamericanlit.com/files/Linda_Hogan.pdf|website=Writers of the Native American Renaissance|publisher=Native American Lit|accessdate=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work, whether fiction or non-fiction, expresses an indigenous understanding of the world. She has written essays and poems on a variety of subjects, both fictional and nonfictional, biographical and from research.  Hogan has also written historical novels.  Her work studies the historical wrongs done to Native Americans and the American environment since the European colonization of North America.

Hogan was a professor at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] and the [[University of Oklahoma]].Hogan is the second minority woman to become a full professor at the University of Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hogan|first1=Linda|title=Linda Hogan Biography|url=http://www.lindahoganwriter.com/index.htm|website=Linda Hogan Writer|publisher=lindahoganwriter.com|accessdate=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is the (inaugural) Writer-in-Residence for the [[Chickasaw]] Nation in [[Oklahoma]]. 
In October 2011, she instructed a writing workshop through the Abiquiu Workshops in [[Abiquiú, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abiquiuworkshops.com/schedule/dwellings-in-the-heart/ |title=Dwellings: Landscapes Of The Heart / Creative Writing From Nature |publisher=Abiquiu Workshops |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920230537/http://abiquiuworkshops.com/schedule/dwellings-in-the-heart/ |archivedate=September 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She currently teaches one class a year in the graduate writing program at the University of Colorado as she keeps up with her schedule from her other work. Supporting solely herself and her home, Hogan keeps very busy but rarely works full-time because otherwise, she would not be able to write.&lt;ref name="Interview With Linda Hogan"/&gt;

She has now returned to her Chickasaw homeland in Oklahoma, where she lives in [[Tishomingo, Oklahoma|Tishomingo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://centerwest.org/archives/990 Berry, Carol. "A Chickasaw Writer Returns to her Heartland."Center of the American West. University of Colorado. October 26, 2008.] Accessed October 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; with her family. Hogan feels as though she owes the future to her children and grandchildren. She says that her home is a place for her grandchildren particularly because they are given the opportunity to explore nature. Along with this, she believes that tradition and language are extremely important, especially in Native American culture, which is why her family is so important to her. Her work is completely dedicated to her children.&lt;ref name="Interview With Linda Hogan"/&gt;

For the next live shows, Devlin sang "[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]", "[[Sweet Child o' Mine]]", "[[Every Breath You Take]]", "[[I Want You Back]]", "[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]", "[[Kiss Me (Sixpence None the Richer song)|Kiss Me]]". On week 8 she sang "[[MMMBop]]" and "[[Under the Bridge]]", but was in the bottom two against Misha B. Devlin sang [[Chasing Cars]] for survival, but was voted out of the competition by [[Louis Walsh]] and [[Tulisa]]. [[Kelly Rowland]] refused to vote and the majority vote was used. [[Gary Barlow]] said he would have eliminated Devlin as well. However voting statistics revealed that Devlin received more votes than Misha B meaning if the result went to deadlock, Devlin would have been sent through to the semi-final and Misha B would have been eliminated.

After Frankie Cocozza was ejected from the show for breaking one of the competition's rules, the public was given a choice to vote, from 10–12 November, for one act which had been eliminated on week 1 to return. Amelia won the vote with over 48% of the vote and replaced Cocozza. She went on to make the final and finished in third place behind Marcus Collins and Little Mix.

Amelia has signed a £500,000 three-album record deal with [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]] subsidiary [[Xenomania]].

==Over 25s==
[[File:Louis Walsh2009July.jpg|thumb|180px|The over 25s category was mentored by Louis Walsh]]
The "Over 25s" category was mentored by [[Louis Walsh]]. Contestants in this category are of either gender, aged 25 or over. There is no upper age limit. The eight candidates were Sami Brookes, Kitty Brucknell, Goldie Cheung, Joseph Gilligan, Jonjo Kerr, [[Carolynne Poole]], Johnny Robinson and Terry Winstanley. Walsh chose:

===Sami Brookes===
{{redirect|Samantha Brookes|the pageant model|Samantha Brooks}}
'''Samantha "Sami" Brookes''' is from [[Rhyl]], [[Denbighshire]]. She replaced contestant Goldie Cheung, who left at the end of judges' houses. For the first live show, she sang [[Free (Ultra Naté song)|Free]], and was kept in the competition. The following weeks she sang "[[I Will Always Love You (Whitney Houston version)|I Will Always Love You]]" and "[[If I Could Turn Back Time]]". She was placed in the bottom two in the third week, along with fellow Over 25er Kitty Brucknell. She performed "[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]]" in the final showdown. The vote allowed Walsh to send the vote to deadlock, as although Rowland and Barlow sent Brookes home, Contostavlos opted against Brucknell. However, Walsh sent Brookes home, thus eliminating her from the competition. Voting statistics later revealed that Brookes had received more votes from the public than Brucknell meaning if Walsh sent the result to deadlock, Brookes would have been saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=X Factor 2011 voting figures revealed: Girl acts won every single week|url=http://metro.co.uk/2011/12/12/x-factor-2011-voting-figures-revealed-girl-acts-won-every-single-week-252825/|work=Metro|accessdate=22 August 2013|author=Christopher Hooton|date=12 December 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517181341/http://metro.co.uk/2011/12/12/x-factor-2011-voting-figures-revealed-girl-acts-won-every-single-week-252825/|archivedate=17 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Janet Devlin won The X Factor vote for the first four weeks, with Little Mix failing to win until week seven - see full voting results since week one|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/janet-devlin-won-the-x-factor-281230|accessdate=22 August 2013|newspaper=Daily Mirror|date=11 December 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115011148/http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/janet-devlin-won-the-x-factor-281230|archivedate=15 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her elimination, Brookes gave interviews accusing Walsh of playing favorites with Brucknell while ignoring her ideas and song lists, and forcing her to perform a Cher song in week 3 instead of a rock number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sami Brookes blames Louis Walsh for X Factor exit and denies Misha B bully claims|url=http://metro.co.uk/2011/10/24/sami-brookes-blames-louis-walsh-for-x-factor-exit-and-denies-misha-b-bully-claims-193135/|work=Metro|publisher=Metro.co|accessdate=22 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513134440/http://metro.co.uk/2011/10/24/sami-brookes-blames-louis-walsh-for-x-factor-exit-and-denies-misha-b-bully-claims-193135/|archivedate=13 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She, however, later stated that she only appeared on the show to boost her profile for a musical theatre career instead of a pop career and a recording contract.

{{Main article|Kitty Brucknell}}
[[File:Kitty Brucknell – Stevenage Christmas Lights Switch-on 2012 (8268539719).jpg|thumb|left|Kitty Brucknell in 2012]]
'''Kitty Brucknell''' (born '''Kimberley Dayle Edwards''' 15 November 1984&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoLS9cDGLhg |title=Kimberley Dayle on Radio One |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=11 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630092711/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoLS9cDGLhg |archivedate=30 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;), is from [[Cheltenham]].&lt;ref name="metro1"/&gt; She used to be a [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]], and (more recently) [[Lady Gaga]] tribute act, and featured on [[Dinner Date]] and also on [[BBC Radio 1]].

In week one, Kitty sang "[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and was put through by her mentor [[Louis Walsh|Louis]]. After the show, [[Brian May]] from Queen spoke out in support of her and thanking her for her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/878379-kitty-brucknell-compared-to-young-freddie-mercury-by-queens-brian-may |title=Kitty Brucknell compared to young Freddie Mercury by Queen's Brian May |publisher=Metro |date=12 October 2009 |accessdate=11 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017123631/http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/878379-kitty-brucknell-compared-to-young-freddie-mercury-by-queens-brian-may |archivedate=17 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In week two, Kitty sang "[[It's Oh So Quiet]]" with a theatrical Alice in Wonderland performance and was put through by the public vote. In week three she was in the bottom two after performing "[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]", along with Sami Brookes in spite of universal praise from the judges. She performed "[[The Edge of Glory]]" in the final showdown. [[Tulisa]] voted to eliminate her, but [[Gary Barlow]], [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Louis Walsh]] all saved her. However Brookes received more votes than Brucknell meaning if Walsh sent the result to deadlock, Brookes would have been saved. In week four for Halloween, Kitty took to the stage on a rotating wheel with pyrotechnics and a circus theme to perform "[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)|Sweet Dreams]]" and was put through by the public vote. In week five, Kitty sang a classic [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] song: "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]", but she was in the bottom three along with The Risk and Johnny Robinson in a double elimination special. The Risk had the fewest votes from the public and were eliminated. Brucknell and Robinson then sang again for survival in the final showdown. Her mentor Louis Walsh, Tulisa and Kelly Rowland all saved her and voted against Robinson. Although he was not required to vote as the judges had reached a majority verdict (like in the previous week), Gary confirmed he would have voted Robinson off. However it was revealed that Robinson received more votes than Brucknell meaning if the result went to deadlock, Robinson would have been saved. On the sixth live show, Kitty wanted to sing "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]". Misha B sung the song instead of Brucknell. Kitty then sang "[[Don't Stop Me Now]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Kitty was for the third time in the final showdown along with Misha B. She sang "[[Somewhere Over The Rainbow]]". Brucknell was eliminated after only Walsh voted to save her. However voting statistics revealed that Brucknell received more votes than Misha B meaning if the result went to deadlock, Brucknell would have been saved. After her elimination, [[Lady Gaga]] ran on stage in tears to comfort her. Brucknell's impromptu performance of "Born This Way" was featured at the end of the 19 November 2011 episode of ''[[Harry Hill's TV Burp]]''.

Brucknell returned to ''The X Factor'' in 2013 when she performed alongside other former contestants such as Rylan Clarke, Jedward, Wagner, 2 Shoes, Diva Fever and Johnny Robinson at the final in Wembley Arena.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} In January 2013, She went on her first tour which was dubbed the "Glamour and Damage" Tour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} She featured on a single which was released in [[Germany]] entitled "No Tomorrow".{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Groups==
[[File:Tulisa1.jpg|thumb|180px|The groups were mentored by singer Tulisa Contostavlos]]
The Groups category was mentored by [[Tulisa Contostavlos]]. Acts in this category are duos or vocal groups. All members must be aged 16 or over. The eight candidates were 2 Shoes, The Estrelles, Girl v Boy, The Keys, The Lovettes, Nu Vibe, Little Mix (formerly known as Rhythmix) and The Risk. Contostavlos chose:

===2 Shoes===

'''2 Shoes''' are a duo from [[Brentwood, Essex]], made up of Charley Bird (23), a telesales worker, and Lucy Texeira (21), a retail assistant. Bird became a mother to Beaux Bird, whom she gave birth to in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xfactor.itv.com/2011/finalists/2-shoes |title=The X Factor – 2 Shoes |publisher=Xfactor.itv.com |accessdate=11 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115230639/http://xfactor.itv.com/2011/finalists/2-shoes |archivedate=15 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the first of the groups to be eliminated from the live shows on 9 October by decision of mentor Tulisa Contostavlos, as there was no public vote in the inaugural live show. They were in the running to replace Frankie Cocozza after he was eliminated from the contest, but received the fewest votes.&lt;ref name="restoreact" /&gt; Their debut single, a cover of [[Kathy Brown]]'s "[[Turn Me On (Turn Me Out)]]" was produced by 'In Demand Music', and mixed by Christian Davies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiandavies.co.uk/credits.php|title=In Demand - Music - Video - Events|first=In Demand Music - In Demand|last=Digital|website=www.christiandavies.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812053404/http://christiandavies.co.uk/credits.php|archivedate=12 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and set an initial release date of 13 August 2012, but this was later postponed to 3 September 2012. The music video premiered on 22 June 2012. 2 Shoes are signed to [[All Around the World Productions]], the same record label as their former mentor, Contostavlos. On 14 August 2012, 2 Shoes were nominated for Best Music Act at the 2012 National Reality Television Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalrealitytvawards.com/articles/tv-news/2-shoes-nominated-for-best-music-act/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406173334/http://www.nationalrealitytvawards.com/articles/tv-news/2-shoes-nominated-for-best-music-act/ |archivedate=6 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judges then called them back and put them together as a group. They were put through to the live shows by their mentor Tulisa. For the first live show they sang [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]]'s "[[Beautiful People (Chris Brown song)|Beautiful People]]". Tulisa then sent them through to the first public vote after the first live show. For the second live show Nu Vibe sang [[U2]]'s "[[With or Without You]]".

===The Risk===

'''The Risk''' was a four-piece boyband that were initially composed of Ashley Baptiste (22, from London), car salesman Andy Merry (20, from [[Ayr]]), [[Burger King]] chef Derry Mensah (21, from London), Marlon McKenzie (28, from [[Manchester]]), and Mitchell McPike. Charlie Healy (25, from [[Coventry]]) was brought into the band, while Marlon and Mitchell were removed from the group at judges houses stage of the competition in a unique decision that has never been made before in X Factor history.&lt;ref name="metro1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xfactor.itv.com/2011/finalists/the-risk|title=The X Factor – The Risk|publisher=itv.com|accessdate=11 November 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112143356/http://xfactor.itv.com/2011/finalists/the-risk|archivedate=12 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healy originally auditioned in another group, The Keys, while the other three auditioned as soloists. Andy previously auditioned for ''The X Factor'' in [[The X Factor (UK series 5)|2008]], and came second in the [[United Kingdom in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2004|United Kingdom selection]] for the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2004|Junior Eurovision Song Contest]] in 2004. The band came under criticism from a Scottish band from [[Prestwick]], who have been performing together for several years as The Risk. They asked ''The X Factor'' management to change the name of its contestants to avoid confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/273910-scots-band-the-risk-want-x-factor-group-to-change-name/|title=STV: Scots band The Risk want X Factor group to change name|publisher=Entertainment.stv.tv|date=9 October 2011|accessdate=11 November 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613021509/http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/273910-scots-band-the-risk-want-x-factor-group-to-change-name/|archivedate=13 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 2011, just before week four's live show, it was announced that original member Ashley Baptiste had decided to leave the band after stating that his heart did not lie within a boyband any more. He was replaced by Ashford Campbell, as a fourth member. Campbell had been previously a member of Nu Vibe, but his original band had been eliminated on 16 October in week two of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2011/10/30/x-factor-2011-the-risk-s-ashley-baptiste-quit-show-for-jesus-as-uneasy-with-halloween-theme-115875-23524531/ |title=X Factor 2011: The Risk's Ashley Baptiste quit show for Jesus as uneasy with Halloween theme |work=Daily Mirror |date=30 October 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030135343/http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2011/10/30/x-factor-2011-the-risk-s-ashley-baptiste-quit-show-for-jesus-as-uneasy-with-halloween-theme-115875-23524531/ |archivedate=30 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In week 5, they received the fewest public votes and were sent home, after finding themselves in the bottom three with Johnny Robinson and Kitty Brucknell.

Later on, Ashley went on to release his debut single, "Show the People (How to Love)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsjI6J1O5fU|title=Show The People How To Love – Ashley John-Baptiste @AJBOfficial|publisher=YouTube|date=23 January 2012|accessdate=23 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140612053855/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsjI6J1O5fU|archivedate=12 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luis Anastasio Somoza Debayle''' (18 November 1922 – 13 April 1967) was the 26th [[List of Presidents of Nicaragua|President]] of [[Nicaragua]] from 29 September 1956 to 1 May 1963, but was effectively [[dictator]] of the country from 1956 until his death.

Somoza Debayle was born in [[León, Nicaragua|León]].  At the age of 14, he and his younger brother [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle|Anastasio]] attended [[Saint Leo University|Saint Leo College Prep]] near [[Tampa]], before transferring to [[La Salle Military Academy]] on [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Horgan, James J. (1990). ''Pioneer College: The Centennial History of Saint Leo College, Saint Leo Abbey, and Holy Name Priory''.  Saint Leo College Press. p 464&lt;/ref&gt; Luis was then educated at [[Louisiana State University]], where he was a member of [[Fi Sigma Alfa]] Hispanic fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fisigmaalfa.org/eterno.htm |title=Capitulo Eterno |publisher=fisigmaalfa.org |accessdate=2008-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415101900/http://www.fisigmaalfa.org/eterno.htm |archivedate=2008-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[assassination]] of his father, [[Anastasio Somoza García]], Luis was tapped as acting president, and was elected president in his own right later that year.  His rule was somewhat milder than that of his father.  However, civil liberties remained restricted, and corruption remained widespread.

His brother, [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]], headed the [[Guardia Nacional (Nicaragua)|National Guard]] and was the second most powerful man in the country during his older brother's rule.  Although Luis declined to run for reelection in 1963, he and Anastasio saw to it that the presidency was held from 1963 onward by politicians loyal to the Somozas.  As a result, Luis remained the real power in Nicaragua until his death in 1967, when he suffered a massive [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[Managua]] at the age of 44.

Under Luis Somoza's regime, Nicaragua played a key role leading to the creation of the [[Central American Common Market]], with the [[Alliance for Progress]] backing that common market's creation. During the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], he allowed the [[CIA]]-trained [[Cuba]]n rebels to embark from [[Puerto Cabezas]], on Nicaragua's Caribbean coast. The [[Sandinistas]] began their struggle against the government in 1963—a struggle that would oust his brother in 1979.

He is entombed at Cementerio Occidental with his father, in the National Guard Mausoleum in Managua, Nicaragua. His wife died in 2014.

McGuinness acknowledged that he was a former IRA member, but stated that he left the IRA in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Henry McDonald [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/12/ira-relative-martin-mcguinness-blood IRA victim's brother says Martin McGuinness has blood on his hands] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 12 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He originally joined the [[Official IRA]], unaware of the split at the December 1969 Army Convention, switching to the [[Provisional IRA]] soon after. By the start of 1972, at the age of 21, he was second-in-command of the IRA in [[Derry]], a position he held at the time of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]], when 14 civil rights protesters were killed in the city by soldiers of the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1308899.stm|title=BBC News – NORTHERN IRELAND – McGuinness confirms IRA role|website=New.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/widgery.htm|title=CAIN: [Widgery Report] Report of the Tribunal appointed to inquire into events on Sunday, 30 January 1972|work=ulst.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Saville Inquiry]] into the events of that day, [[Paddy Ward]] stated he had been the leader of the [[Fianna Éireann|Fianna]], the youth wing of the IRA at the time of Bloody Sunday. He said that McGuinness and an anonymous IRA member gave him bomb parts that morning. He said that his organisation intended to attack city centre premises in Derry on the same day. In response, McGuinness said the statements were "fantasy", while Gearóid Ó hEára (formerly Gerry O'Hara), a Derry [[Sinn Féin]] councillor, stated that he and not Ward was the Fianna leader at the time.&lt;ref&gt;John Innes, [http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=628&amp;id=1161662003 "McGuinness is named as bomb runner"], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 21 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inquiry concluded that, although McGuinness was "engaged in paramilitary activity" at the time of Bloody Sunday and had probably been armed with a [[Thompson submachine gun]], there was insufficient evidence to make any finding other than they were "sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire".&lt;ref name=SavilleMcGuinness3119&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003/#the-report|title=Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry – Volume I – Chapter 3|publisher=Bloody Sunday Inquiry|date=15 June 2010|accessdate=15 June 2010|quote=3.119 in the course of investigating the activities of the Provisional and Official IRA on the day, we considered at some length allegations that Martin McGuinness, at that time the Adjutant of the Derry Brigade or Command of the Provisional IRA, had engaged in paramilitary activity during the day. In the end we were left in some doubt as to his movements on the day. Before the soldiers of Support Company went into the Bogside he was probably armed with a Thompson sub-machine gun, and though it is possible that he fired this weapon, there is insufficient evidence to make any finding on this, save that we are sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824013430/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003|archivedate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGuinness negotiated alongside [[Gerry Adams]] with the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], [[William Whitelaw|Willie Whitelaw]], in 1972. In 1973, he was convicted by the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s [[Special Criminal Court]], after being arrested near a car containing {{convert|250|lb|kg}} of explosives and nearly 5,000 rounds of ammunition. He refused to recognise the court, and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. In court, he declared his membership of the Provisional IRA without equivocation: "We have fought against the killing of our people... I am a member of [[Óglaigh na hÉireann]] and very, very proud of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Taylor (Journalist)|title=Provos The IRA &amp; Sinn Féin|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year=1997|pages=152–53|isbn=0-7475-3818-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release, and another conviction in the Republic of Ireland for IRA membership, he became increasingly prominent in Sinn Féin, the political wing of the [[Republican movement (Ireland)|republican movement]]. He was in indirect contact with British intelligence during the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|1981 hunger strikes]], and again in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinnfein.ie/contents/15216 |title=Setting the Record Straight &amp;#124; Sinn Féin |website=Sinnfein.ie |date= |accessdate=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly (1982)|Northern Ireland Assembly]] at [[Parliament Building of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] in 1982, representing [[Londonderry (Assembly constituency)|Londonderry]]. He was the second candidate elected after [[John Hume]]. As with all elected members of Sinn Féin and the SDLP, he did not take up his seat.&lt;ref&gt;''Martin McGuinness: From Guns to Government'' by Liam Clarke and Kathryn Johnston ({{ISBN|1-84018-725-5}}), pages 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 December 1982, McGuinness, Gerry Adams and [[Danny Morrison (writer)|Danny Morrison]] were banned from entering Great Britain under the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act (Northern Ireland)|Prevention of Terrorism Act]] by the [[Home Secretary]], William Whitelaw.&lt;ref&gt;''Martin McGuinness: From Guns to Government'' by Liam Clarke and Kathryn Johnston ({{ISBN|1-84018-725-5}}), page 155&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1993, he was the subject of a two-part special by ''[[The Cook Report]]'', a [[ITV Central|Central TV]] investigative documentary series presented by [[Roger Cook (journalist)|Roger Cook]]. It accused him of continuing involvement in IRA activity, of attending an interrogation and of encouraging Frank Hegarty, an informer, to return to Derry from a safe house in England. Hegarty's mother Rose appeared on the programme to tell of telephone calls to McGuinness and of Hegarty's subsequent murder. McGuinness denied her account and denounced the programme saying "I have never been in the IRA. I don't have any sway over the IRA".&lt;ref&gt;''Martin McGuinness: From Guns to Government'' by Liam Clarke and Kathryn Johnston ({{ISBN|1-84018-725-5}}), page 222&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]], the Irish [[Tánaiste]], stated McGuinness, along with Gerry Adams and [[Martin Ferris]], were members of the seven-man [[IRA Army Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1483997/Adams-and-McGuinness-named-as-IRA-leaders.html |title=Adams and McGuinness named as IRA leaders |first=Thomas |last=Harding |date=21 February 2005 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=9 May 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGuinness denied this, saying he was no longer an IRA member. Experienced [[The Troubles|Troubles]] journalist [[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]] presented further apparent evidence of McGuinness's role in the IRA in his documentary ''Age of Terror'', shown in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7356159.stm Age of Terror], [[BBC News]], 21 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In his documentary, Taylor alleges that McGuinness was the head of the [[IRA's Northern Command]] and had advance knowledge of the IRA's 1987 [[Remembrance Day bombing|Enniskillen bombing]], which left 11 civilians dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7356159.stm|title=BBC NEWS – UK – Who knew about Enniskillen plans?|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chief negotiator and Minister of Education ==
He became Sinn Féin's chief negotiator in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] negotiations which led to the [[Good Friday Agreement]].  At the time of his death, former US President Bill Clinton noted that McGuinness was the one who personally oversaw the Agreement's arms decommissioning phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clintonfoundation.org/press-releases/statement-president-clinton-passing-martin-mcguinness|title=Statement from President Clinton on the Passing of Martin McGuinness|website=Clintonfoundation.org|accessdate=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair also acknowledged the leading role which McGuinness had in ensuring the Agreement would be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.derrynow.com/news/tony-blair-martin-mcguinness-good-friday-agreement-never-achieved-without-martins-leadership-courage/151921|title=Tony Blair on Martin McGuinness - Good Friday Agreement could never have been achieved 'without Martin's leadership and courage'|website=Derrynow.com|accessdate=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected to the [[Northern Ireland Forum]] in 1996 representing [[Foyle (Assembly constituency)|Foyle]]. Having contested Foyle unsuccessfully at the 1983, 1987 and 1992 Westminster elections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Election Data 1987|url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_1987.txt|publisher=[[Electoral Calculus]]|accessdate=18 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015054243/http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_1987.txt|archivedate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Election Data 1983|url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_1983.txt|publisher=[[Electoral Calculus]]|accessdate=18 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015054231/http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_1983.txt|archivedate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Election Data 1992|url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_1992ob.txt|publisher=[[Electoral Calculus]]|accessdate=18 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015054418/http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_1992ob.txt|archivedate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became MP for [[Mid Ulster (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Ulster]] in 1997 and after the Agreement was concluded, was returned as a member of the Assembly for the [[Mid Ulster (Assembly constituency)|same constituency]], and nominated by his party for a ministerial position in the power-sharing [[Northern Ireland Executive|executive]], where he became Minister of Education. One of his controversial acts as Minister of Education was his decision to scrap the [[Eleven plus exam|11-plus exam]], which he had failed as a child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/549635.stm. McGuinness: Let's work together] BBC News, 4 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected to the Westminster Parliament in 2001, 2005 and 2010.

In May 2003, transcripts of telephone calls between McGuinness and British officials including [[Mo Mowlam]], the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and [[Jonathan Powell (Labour adviser)|Jonathan Powell]], [[Tony Blair]]'s Chief of Staff, were published in a biography of McGuinness entitled ''From Guns to Government'' by Kathryn Johnston and Liam Clarke. The tapes had been made by [[MI5]] and the authors of the book were arrested under the [[Official Secrets Act]]. The conversations showed an easy and friendly relationship between McGuinness and Powell. He joked with Powell about [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] MPs while Mowlam referred to him as "babe" and discussed her difficulties with Blair. In another transcript, he praised [[Bill Clinton]] to Gerry Adams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/mcguinness-taps.htm |title=Martin McGuinness Wiretap Transcripts |publisher=Cryptome.org |accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the weeks following the [[St Andrews Agreement]], the four biggest parties—the DUP, Sinn Féin, the UUP and the SDLP—indicated their choice of ministries in the Executive and nominated members to fill them. The Assembly convened on 8 May 2007 and Paisley and McGuinness were nominated as First Minister and deputy First Minister respectively.

On 8 December 2007, while visiting President of the United States [[George W. Bush]] in the [[White House]] with the Northern Ireland First Minister Ian Paisley, McGuinness said to the press, "Up until the 26 March this year, Ian Paisley and I never had a conversation about anything—not even about the weather—and now we have worked very closely together over the last seven&amp;nbsp;months and there's been no angry words between us.... This shows we are set for a new course."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7123939.stm Paisley and McGuinness in US trip] BBC News, 3 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martina Purdy [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7134094.stm 'Charming' ministers woo president] BBC News, 8 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 December 2012 McGuinness announced that he had formally resigned as the MP for Mid-Ulster stating "I have served formal notice of my resignation from the position of MP for Mid-Ulster with immediate effect. This is in line with my party's commitment to end [[double jobbing]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20871049 "Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness resigns as Mid-Ulster MP"], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, he was made [[Steward of the Manor of Northstead]] on 2 January 2013 by Chancellor [[George Osborne]], making him an employee of the Crown and thus ineligible for membership of the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2013/0102/breaking32.html | work=The Irish Times|title=McGuinness awarded British title}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_01_13.htm |title=Manor of Northstead|publisher=HM Treasury |date=2 January 2013 |accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Renewable Heat Incentive scandal}}
[[File:Martin McGuinness and Michelle O'Neill.jpg|thumb|[[Michelle O'Neill]] replaced McGuinness as Sinn Féin's leader in the Northern Ireland Assembly in January 2017]]
In November 2016, a scandal came to light surrounding the Renewable Heat Incentive, an energy incentive championed by [[Arlene Foster]] when she was [[Department for the Economy|Minister for Enterprise, Trade, and Incentives]] in 2012. The incentive would cost the Northern Ireland Executive £480m over 20 years, and was marred by allegations of fraud, which were not acknowledged or acted upon by Foster or the DUP.&lt;ref name="whistleblower"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Macauley|first1=Conor|title=Renewable Heat Incentive scheme: Whistleblower 'ignored' after reporting abuse claims|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-37925402|work=BBC News|date=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGuinness and others in Sinn Féin called for Foster (now First Minister) to step aside to allow for independent inquiries, but Foster refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sinn Féin to table motion calling on Northern Irish First Minister to stand aside|url=http://www.newstalk.com/reader/47.301/89159/0/|work=newstalk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RHI scandal: Foster rejects Sinn Fein proposal to step aside during probe|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/business/rhi-scandal-foster-rejects-sinn-fein-proposal-to-step-aside-during-probe-1-7761880|work=Newsletter.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foster made a statement before the Assembly on 19 December without McGuinness' approval (as required under the power-sharing agreement), resulting in Sinn Féin and the opposition parties all walking out of the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Gareth|title=Robin Newton: 'Concerns recognised' over RHI statement|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-38373619|work=BBC News|date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinn Féin President [[Gerry Adams]] indicated on 8 January 2017 that McGuinness could resign, thus vacating both his and Foster's offices, if Foster did not agree to temporarily step aside to allow an independent inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RHI scandal: Gerry Adams says Sinn Féin will act over fiasco|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-38541704|work=BBC News|date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGuinness resigned the following day; in his statements to the press, he said "Today is the right time to call a halt to the DUP's arrogance", and said that Foster had a "clear conflict of interest" in the affair.&lt;ref name="Resignation" /&gt; Another reason cited for his resignation was the decision by DUP [[Department for Communities|Minister for Communities]] [[Paul Givan]] to remove £50,000 in funding from the [[Liofa]] Gaeltacht Bursary scheme, a yearly programme that allowed 100 school-age children to travel to the [[Gaeltacht#Donegal Gaeltacht|Donegal Gaeltacht]] to learn the [[Irish language]].&lt;ref name="liofa"&gt;{{cite news|title=Irish language bursary funding 'found' says Paul Givan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-38594609|work=BBC News|date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinn Féin refused to nominate a successor to McGuinness before 16 January, resulting in the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], [[James Brokenshire]], calling for [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2017|new elections]] scheduled for 2 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elections to be held in NI on 2 March|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-38641857|work=BBC News|date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGuinness subsequently announced that he would not run for re-election, due to ill health.&lt;ref name=Dominiczak /&gt;

'''Martin "Musa" Musaubach'''(born May 23, 1982 in [[La Plata]], [[Argentina]]) is an Argentine band-leading pianist, composer, arranger and producer in [[MUSA's]].

==About==

Musa has been learning, studying and working as keyboardist since very young age. He was the member of jazz, blues and Latin music bands including Labrusca, Zoe, 5 Australes, Reina Venus, Blues Oil and Bin Bin, which Labrusca was the first band he joined in his hometown La Plata&amp;mdash;he was only at the early age of 13, as a keyboardist and the youngest member in the band.&lt;ref name="studiologic"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.studiologic-music.com/musicians/martin-musaubach.html |title=Musicians: Martin Musaubach @Studiologic Music | accessdate=2013-09-26 |work=Studiologic Music |date=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="album"&gt;Introducted from Martin Musaubach studio album "3690" (released Aug 16 2013 under AsiaMuse Entertainment)&lt;/ref&gt;

From around 2007 Musa started his career in [[China]] playing live music in some famous jazz bars with his band members as MUSAS. By 2011 he was the Musical Director in Shangri-La Summit Wing Hotel ([[Beijing]]), and leading his own Latin jazz band MUSA's Trio with bass/ double bassist [[Lautaro Bellucca|Lautaro "LuKa" Bellucca]] and drummer/ percussionist [[Adriano Moreira (Gaofei)|Adriano "Gaofei" Moreira]]. In the 3rd quarter of 2011, accompanied by LuKa and Gaofei, Musa moved to [[Taipei]] to join ''Gary Chaw Project SENSATION'' (the band, so as a music project) as the key pianist and composer with the Malaysian Chinese vocalist [[Gary Chaw]] and Taiwanese compose-producer Michael Tu.&lt;ref name="twnext"&gt;台灣壹週刊 Next Magazine Taiwan #581 (2012/07/12) - p.194 - 紅男綠女「音樂讓我們相遇 Sensation」&lt;/ref&gt;

Musa is now living in Taipei as his new home and working location, continued to play music in local jazz bars and venues with his bandmates and different musicians, at the same time collaborating with mainstream record labels and artists in live performing or recording albums.

== Biography ==

Salameh first became interested in mountaineering in 2004 while working as a food and beverage manager at the Sheraton Hotel in Edinburgh, Scotland. His interest started when he had a dream of himself praying on top of Mt. Everest. His first climb in the Himalaya was in April 2004, when he tried to climb [[Mera Peak]] ({{convert|6,500|m}}) in Nepal, but had to retreat just {{convert|200|m}} from the top because of illness.&lt;ref name="Arab Irish Journal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Onwards &amp; Upwards|url=http://www.jaicc.ie/sites/jaicc.test.drupal.web.ie/files/Arab%20Irish%20Journal.pdf|work=the arab irish journal – Arab-Irish Chamber of Commerce|pages=50–55|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His ascent of Everest was finally made on May{{nbsp}}25, 2008, Jordan Independence Day, after he had sold some of his possessions to fund the expedition.&lt;ref name="IE"&gt;{{cite web|title='I rang the King of Jordan from the top of Everest'|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/i-rang-the-king-of-jordan-from-the-top-of-everest-26734224.html|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rang his parents and the King of Jordan via satellite phone from the peak.&lt;ref name="IE"/&gt;

He completed the "Seven Summits" on November{{nbsp}}16, 2012 and is now among the (as of 2012) 235 people in the world at the time to have stood on top of the highest peak on every continent.&lt;ref name="Jordan Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jordanian climber tackles Seven Summits|url=http://jordantimes.com/jordanian-climber-tackles-seven-summits|newspaper=Jordan Times|date=31 January 2013|author=Muath Freij|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115228/http://jordantimes.com/jordanian-climber-tackles-seven-summits|archivedate=26 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reached the North Pole on April 19, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=meet our 2014 north pole teams|url=http://polarexplorers.com/polarexplorers-media/blog/north-pole/item/46-meet-our-2014-north-pole-teams|website=Polar Explorers|accessdate=26 June 2014|date=28 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819185902/http://polarexplorers.com/polarexplorers-media/blog/north-pole/item/46-meet-our-2014-north-pole-teams|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Mostafa was awarded the [[Order of Independence (Jordan)|Independence Medal]] by King [[Abdullah II of Jordan]] for his ascent of Everest.&lt;ref name=7iberDotCom&gt;{{cite web|title=UPDATE: Climber Knighted By HM King Abdullah|url=http://www.7iber.org/2008/10/update-climber-knighted-by-hm-king-abdullah/#disqus_thread|website=7iberDotCom|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His Royal Highness Ali Ibn Al Hussein and HRH Princess Haya Bint Al Hussein, the King’s brother and sister respectively, have also been major supporters.&lt;ref name="Arab Irish Journal" /&gt;

He reached South Pole on January 15, 2016.&lt;ref name="Adopted Scot and First Muslim"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adopted Scot and First Muslim|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/just-brrrrilliant-adopted-scot-first-7213312#ySirqth6hHFTl0IY.97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is now 1 of 16 people in the world who completed the [[Explorers Grand Slam]].

== Motivational speaking ==
Mostafa acts as a motivational speaker, addressing youths, corporate management and employees through direct comparisons between summit expeditions and daily life experiences. He focuses on themes such as team building, leadership, motivation and facing personal fears.&lt;ref name="Mostafa Salameh"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Speaking|url=http://www.mostafasalameh.com/speaking|work=Mostafa Salameh|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030170053/http://www.mostafasalameh.com/speaking|archivedate=2013-10-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He names as his role models the philosopher [[Al Razi]], the explorer [[Ibn Battuta]], the philosopher, mathematician, physician and musician [[Al Kindi]], the poet, jurist and theologian [[Rumi]] and the late [[King Hussein]].&lt;ref name="Arab Irish Journal" /&gt; He had also come to Birla Public School in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]] for a small speech as a part of a fund to aid relief in Gaza.

'''Nadim Kobeissi''' (born 1990) is a computer science researcher specialized in [[applied cryptography]] and a professor at [[New York University]]'s Paris campus. He is the author of [[Cryptocat]], an open-source encrypted web chat client. Kobeissi is also known for speaking publicly against [[Internet censorship]] and [[Internet surveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newint.org/blog/2013/06/21/prism-surveillance-nsa-software/|title=How to fight PRISM|date=21 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and education==
Kobeissi was born in [[Beirut]], Lebanon. He studied psychology at the [[Lebanese American University]] in Beirut from 2008–2009, and graduated with a double major in political science and philosophy at [[Concordia University]] in Montreal in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.nadim.cc/resume.pdf Resumé], nadim.cc. Retrieved 12 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After that he was a PhD student studying applied cryptography at the [[French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation]] (Inria), in France &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nadim.computer/|title=Nadim Kobeissi|website=nadim.computer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked at [[Microsoft Research]] in [[Cambridge]], [[United Kingdom]].

==Research==
Kobeissi is the primary author of Cryptocat. In 2012, he presented Cryptocat at the [[Hackers on Planet Earth|HOPE]] hacker conference in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopenumbernine.net/schedule/#whybrowser|title=Schedule - HOPE Number 9|website=www.hopenumbernine.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r95Apc5riyE|title=Nadim Kobeissi HOPE 9  Why Browser Cryptography Is Bad &amp; How We Can Make It Great|first=|last=TheEthanwashere|date=1 October 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the following year, Kobeissi presented Cryptocat-related talks and research at [[Google]]'s Internet at Liberty conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netizenproject.org/2012/06/10/cryptocat-and-internet-freedom-innovation/|title=Page not found – Netizen Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beirut's SHARE conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shareconference.net/en/talk/cryptocat-nadim-kobeissi|title=Cryptocat - Nadim Kobeissi - SHARE Foundation|first=Fermicoding Internet Engineering,|last=www.fermicoding.com|website=www.shareconference.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chaos Computer Club]]'s SIGINT2013 conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sigint.ccc.de/schedule/speakers/3812.html|title=Cryptocat: The Social and Technical Challenges of Making Crypto Accessible to Everyone|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at RightsCon in Rio de Janeiro,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.crypto.cat/2012/06/a-cryptocat-spring/|title=A Cryptocat Spring|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at Republika in Rijeka, Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.republika.io/en/performer/103?width=560&amp;height=80%2525&amp;iframe=true Nadim Kobeissi: Cryptocat&lt;/ref&gt;

Kobeissi is also known for discovering a privacy issue in [[Windows 8]], in which the operating system automatically reported to Microsoft what applications users were installing in an insecure fashion. Kobeissi's research was picked up by [[Gizmodo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5937649/windows-8-tells-microsoft-about-everything-you-install-not-very-securely|title=Windows 8 Tells Microsoft About Everything You Install, Not Very Securely|first=Nadim|last=Kobeissi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Microsoft issued a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bgr.com/2012/08/24/windows-8-privacy-microsoft-smartscreen/|title=Windows 8 sends Microsoft information about every program you install [updated]|first=Dan|last=Graziano|date=24 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kobeissi is also a known proponent of browser cryptography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nadim.computer/post/84140092153/thoughts-on-critiques-of-javascript-cryptography|title=Thoughts on Critiques of JavaScript Cryptography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a member of the [[W3C]]'s Web Cryptography Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/2000/09/dbwg/details?group=54174&amp;public=1&amp;order=org|title=Participants in the Web Cryptography Working Group - DBWG, the Working Groups Database|website=www.w3.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
In 2010, Kobeissi was one of the earliest supporters of the [[Chelsea Manning#Impact and reception|Bradley Manning Support Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Denver Nicks|Nicks, Denver]] (2012). ''Private: Bradley Manning, WikiLeaks, and the Biggest Exposure of Official Secrets in American History''. Chicago Review Press, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; He organized a march through Montreal in December that year in support of [[WikiLeaks]], ran a WikiLeaks mirror site, and defended WikiLeaks on various Canadian news publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2010/12/08/wikileaks-mirror-site-in-montreal.html|title=Montreal student hosts mirror WikiLeaks site|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2011 and 2012, Kobeissi hosted CHOMP.FM, a radio program on Internet activism that ran weekly on Montreal's [[CKUT-FM]] radio station. The show included guests from the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), security researcher [[Bruce Schneier]], and journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]].&lt;ref&gt;For the march, see Shingler, Benjamin (18 December 2010).

In 2013, Kobeissi led an effort known as the Skype Open Letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skypeopenletter.com/|title=PHEENIX::SELL|first=|last=Pheenix|website=www.skypeopenletter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which brought together more than forty organizations, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, [[Reporters Without Borders]], and the [[Open Technology Institute]], calling on [[Microsoft]] and [[Skype]] to release [[Transparency Report|transparency reports]] regarding Skype monitoring and surveillance. The effort was successful, and Microsoft released its first transparency report shortly after the letter was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/its-time-transparency-reports-become-new-normal|title=It's Time for Transparency Reports to Become the New Normal|date=29 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Detention and entrapment attempt===
Kobeissi was detained and questioned at the U.S. border by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]] in June 2012 about Cryptocat's censorship resistance. He tweeted about the incident afterwards, resulting in media coverage and a spike in the popularity of Cryptocat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/06/07/detaining-developer-at-us-border-increases-cryptocat-popularity|title=Detaining Developer At US Border Increases Cryptocat Popularity|first=Jon|last=Matonis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/News.asp?id=67866|title=Developer’s detention spikes interest in Montreal’s Cryptocat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kobeissi was regularly searched and questioned whenever he flew in the U.S. in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/07/crypto-cat-encryption-for-all/|title=This Cute Chat Site Could Save Your Life and Help Overthrow Your Government|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] attempted to entrap Kobeissi using [[Sabu (hacktivist)|Sabu]] – an American hacker involved with [[LulzSec]], an offshoot of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] – as an undercover informant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Somini | last=Sengupta | title=A Hacker Charms and Disappoints | url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/a-hacker-charms-and-disappoints/ | newspaper=The New York Times |date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kobeissi responded on his blog: "To all young hackers out there – use your talents for research. Never acquiesce to anything illegal with anyone, even if they do it with you."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Nadim | last=Kobeissi | title=On Sabu and FBI Entrapment | url=http://log.nadim.cc/?p=65 | publisher=nadim.cc | date=12 March 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618010832/http://log.nadim.cc/?p=65 | archivedate=18 June 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryptocat vulnerability===
In mid-2013, critical vulnerabilities were discovered and fixed in the Cryptocat application suite,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web| title=DecryptoCat | url=http://tobtu.com/decryptocat.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tobtu.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tobtu.com/decryptocat-old.php|title=DecryptoCat - TobTu|website=tobtu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially exposing prior communication via the chat program for over a year. The vulnerability was limited to group chat and did not affect private one-on-one conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.crypto.cat/2013/07/new-critical-vulnerability-in-cryptocat-details/|title=New Critical Vulnerability in Cryptocat: Details|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705051050/https://blog.crypto.cat/2013/07/new-critical-vulnerability-in-cryptocat-details/|archivedate=2013-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing controversy centered on the technical naïveté of Nadim and others who had worked on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Bad kitty! "Rookie mistake" in Cryptocat chat app makes cracking a snap | url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/07/bad-kitty-rooky-mistake-in-cryptocat-chat-app-makes-cracking-a-snap/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Thomas, the security researcher who discovered the vulnerabilities, blogged criticizing Cryptocat as "run by people that don't know [[Cryptography|crypto]], make stupid mistakes, and [does not have] enough eyes [that] are looking at their code to find the bugs."&lt;ref name="tobtu.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/07/04/cryptocat_wide_open_new_version_a_must/|title=Cryptocat WIDE OPEN, new version a must|first=Richard Chirgwin 4 Jul 2013 at 22:27|last=tweet_btn()|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this comment was removed in more recent versions of Thomas's blog post.

Meanwhile, other security blogs and news sites called the vulnerability a "responsible disclosure" and praised Cryptocat's transparency regarding vulnerabilities and Kobeissi's warnings regarding the experimental nature of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/07/06/cryptocat-encrypted-group-chats-may-have-been-crackable-for-7-months/|title=Cryptocat ‘encrypted’ group chats may have been crackable for 7 months|first=Dubstepcat|last=Says|date=5 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staysmartonline.gov.au/alert_service/alerts/_popular_encrypted_chat_service_cryptocat_contained_a_vulnerability_for_7_months|title=Popular "encrypted chat" service Cryptocat contained a vulnerability for 7 months|first=Stay Smart|last=Online|date=18 July 2013|website=www.staysmartonline.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Caudill, an independent security researcher noted that "[Cryptocat developers] didn't understand the data they were working with.

Kobeissi himself had been vocal in the past about other services using [[encryption]]. In a ''[[Forbes]]'' online article investigating the security of encrypted storage service [[Mega (website)|MEGA]], Kobeissi, who voiced concern along with other security researchers, noted: "It's a nice website, but when it comes to cryptography they seem to have no experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/01/21/researchers-warn-megas-new-encrypted-cloud-cant-keep-its-megasecurity-promises/|title=Researchers Warn: Mega's New Encrypted Cloud Doesn't Keep Its Megasecurity Promises|first=Andy|last=Greenberg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made Cryptocat's own vulnerabilities a more high-profile discussion among security researchers. Nevertheless, MEGA eventually adopted Kobeissi's critique and implemented the suggested changes to their cryptographic code delivery methods.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/kaepora/status/359684121221537792&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peerio backdoor claims ===
In January 2016 Kobeissi tweeted his reasons for leaving [[Peerio]], a cloud-based encrypted communications company he co-founded. These centred around potential plans to sell backdoored versions of the Peerio software to certain clients. Peerio soon denied the claims on their own blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grauer|first1=Yael|title=Peerio Co-Founder On Why He Left The Company (Hint: It Had To Do With Admin Backdoors)|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ygrauer/2016/01/25/peerio-co-founder-on-why-he-left-the-company-hint-it-had-to-do-with-admin-backdoors/|website=Forbes.com|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nelson Muntz'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Loan-a Lisa|series=The Simpsons|date=October 3, 2010|number=466|season=22|credits=Garza, Valentina; Faughnan, Matthew|network=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[fictional character]] and the lead school bully from the [[animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]'', best known for his signature mocking laugh "Ha-ha!". He is voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]] and was introduced in Season 1's "[[Bart the General]]" as an [[antagonist]] but later turned into an on-and-off friend of [[Bart Simpson]].

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
Nelson is a student and [[Bullying|bully]] at [[Springfield Elementary School]]. He is known to have terrorized virtually every kid in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] at one point or another. Most often, however, it is the school nerds and less popular students, such as [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] and [[Martin Prince|Martin]], who are the subject of his cruelty. Nelson shows the occasional glimpse of humanity, though, and other characters have occasionally warmed to him; Lisa dates him briefly in "[[Lisa's Date with Density]]", [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] informally adopts him in "[[Sleeping with the Enemy (The Simpsons)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]", and Bart is shown as a friend to him several times, such as in "[[The Haw-Hawed Couple]]".

His family life is dysfunctional. While some early episodes offer inconsistent histories (such as [[Lisa's Date with Density|Nelson's dad going insane and abandoning him]], [[A Milhouse Divided|Nelson's parents divorcing because of his mom's cough drop addiction]], or [[Bart the Mother|Nelson's dad in prison while his mom "has bigger problems"]]), the [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] story that has evolved is that he lives in a dilapidated house with his mother who works on the fringes of the sex industry, either as a waitress at [[Hooters]] or in a topless bar. The [[Characterisation|character design]] and voice portrayal of both parents has varied throughout the course of the series.

It is shown in many episodes that Nelson's father abandoned him and his mother at an early age when he "went to pick up some [[Pop-Tarts]]" although, later on in the series, he was said to have gone to pick up a pack of cigarettes. In the fourth-season episode "[[Brother from the Same Planet]]", Nelson's father is the children's soccer coach who awards Nelson with a free trip to Pele's Soccer and Acting Camp. Nelson's father also appears briefly in the sixth-season episode "[[Bart's Girlfriend]]"; depicted capturing Nelson with a leash as the children run through the cornfields in an attempt to avoid attending church. He also appears in the ninth-season episode "[[Bart Star]]" to congratulate Nelson after a football game victory and take him to Hooters (with Nelson turning down the invitation because he "doesn't want to see [his] Mom at work"). Nelson's father returns in the sixteenth-season episode "[[Sleeping with the Enemy (The Simpsons)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]". It turns out that he did not leave Nelson deliberately; he bit into a chocolate bar, not knowing it had peanuts and had an [[Anaphylaxis|allergic reaction]], covering 90% of his body with large [[tumors]]. Looking like [[Joseph Merrick]], he ran out of the store and encountered a circus that made him a part of its [[freak show]]. At performances, circus attendees threw peanuts at him, which perpetuated his reaction, preventing him from returning to normal. When the circus came through Springfield, Bart recognized him and brought him home to rid himself of Nelson (who had been taken into the Simpson home by Marge).

Nelson is also a natural athlete. In the episode "[[Bart Star]]", Nelson almost singlehandedly carries the entire Springfield Pee-Wee football team. As the team quarterback, he also on one occasion catches his own pass and plows through the opposing team with extreme ease. In various episodes, he gives out the impression that he is a lot smarter than he may first appear. Nelson often points out painfully obvious things to adults and kids alike that take them longer to grasp. Another example is a running joke where Nelson does a class assignment that is implied to be of high quality. However, he is always brushed off by the teachers before he gets to show them his work. Another running joke, though, is Nelson presenting ridiculously simple assignments, such as repeatedly showing a can of tomato paste in Show and Tell, and a presentation on ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'', consisting of himself crushing a bunch of grapes with a hammer, stating "Here's the grapes, and here's the wrath!" In later episodes, Nelson shows signs of being a tormented artist type, even [[Any Given Sundance|submitting a film]] to the [[Sundance Film Festival]] about his life as a child living in poverty with a single, unfit mother and no strong father figure. He memorably says in the documentary, "I like to cry at the ocean, because only there do my tears seem small."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/05/04/the-simpsons-any-given-sundance/ |title=The Simpsons: Any Given Sundance&amp;nbsp;— VIDEO |publisher=Tvsquad.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode "[[Little Big Girl]]", it is revealed that Nelson is German-American. Ironically, in "[[Much Apu About Nothing]]", Nelson picks on foreign exchange student [[Üter Zörker|Üter]] for being German during Springfield's anti-immigration mania. He is shown to be a big fan of [[Andy Williams]] as he, Bart, Milhouse and Martin went to a concert performed by him in "[[Bart on the Road]]".

==Relationships with other characters==
Even though in the first season (and for many seasons afterwards) Nelson seemed to be [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s antagonist, he eventually becomes what can be considered as Bart's second closest friend after Milhouse.

In [[Bart the General|his debut episode]], Lisa was the initial target of Nelson's bullying, which prompted Bart to defend her. Bart's actions resulted in frequent beatings by Nelson and his gang, but finally ended when Bart received help from [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters|Herman]], who came up with the idea of standing up to Nelson and his gang by pelting them with [[water balloon]]s. From that point on, Nelson shows a grudging respect for Bart, though he occasionally reverts to his past behavior towards him.

Although still prone to violence, Nelson hangs out with Bart and his less popular friends, such as [[Milhouse Van Houten]] and occasionally even common bullying target [[Martin Prince]]. In "[[The Debarted]]", it is shown that Nelson has become Bart's "other best friend", along with Milhouse.

Nelson has many other moments where he displays his hidden good nature, such as his brief amorous relationship with Lisa. Although he cannot control his delinquent tendencies, he treats her with respect and even tries to change for her, although both of them realize that he is not being true to himself by doing so. In "[[Lisa's Date with Density]]", Nelson kisses Lisa, only to be berated by [[Jimbo Jones|Jimbo]], [[Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]], and [[Dolph Starbeam|Dolph]], who believe that kissing girls is "[[gay]]" (despite the events that occurred revolving around Jimbo in "[[New Kid On The Block]]").

He also punishes [[Sherri and Terri]] for tormenting Lisa. Another curious example of his "good side" is with Martin, a boy whom Nelson picks on perhaps more so than any other kid in town. Despite the utter cruelty, there are occasional hints that Nelson does not harbor any real hatred towards Martin and only does so to maintain his 'tough guy' reputation. In "[[Dial 'N' for Nerder]]", when it is believed that Martin has died, Nelson endeavours to learn the truth and find Martin's killers. When it is revealed that Martin is alive, Nelson mocks and punches him, but also states that he is glad Martin is not dead. In this same episode, however, when Lisa tries to bribe him to not rat her out by offering to get back together with him, he rejects it. In another episode, it is revealed that both Martin and Nelson went to space camp, and that Nelson was a loyal officer to Martin. (See "[[I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can]]")

In "[[Loan-a Lisa]]", Lisa uses $50 to help Nelson fund his bicycle company, which becomes a success. When Nelson almost drops out of school to spend more time on the company, Lisa is saddened and attempts to stop him from doing so, but eventually respects his decision after realising he won't change despite the money used to fund it. Nelson eventually decides not to drop out after all and takes Lisa skating to make it up to her.

Though Nelson is often said to not really have friends aside from his on-and-off relationship with Bart and the others, Nelson sometimes hangs out with his fellow school bullies [[Jimbo Jones|Jimbo]], [[Dolph Starbeam|Dolph]], [[Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]], and (to a lesser extent) two smaller and younger fraternal twin minions known as the Weasels. Though only seen with them occasionally, Nelson is also ironically the leader of the school bullies (possibly by virtue of being the most often seen and most recognizable of the gang).

In "[[Sleeping with the Enemy (The Simpsons)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]", [[Moe Szyslak]] appears briefly during a Muntz family reunion. The facial similarities between Moe and the Muntz are surprisingly quite apparent and Moe's childhood experiences and behaviors are somewhat relatable with Nelson's. Moe briefly appears and claims that he is part of the family and is then shunned off screen by the Muntz' confused looks.

==Character==
[[File:Nancy Cartwright.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nancy Cartwright]] voices Nelson, even though the role wasn't assigned to her originally.]]
''[[The Simpsons]]'' creator [[Matt Groening]] named Nelson after the [[Nelson hold|wrestling hold of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;Groening, Matt (2004). Commentary for the episode "[[Lady Bouvier's Lover]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson was also said to be named after popular [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]] actor [[Judd Nelson]], who portrayed the character John Bender in the eighties classic ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'', partially of whom Nelson Muntz's character has similarities. Cast member [[Nancy Cartwright]] voices the character, which first appeared in the fifth episode of the first season, "[[Bart the General]]" (1990). American voice actress [[Dana Hill]] was first supposed to provide Nelson's voice, and attended the [[read-through]] of the episode. However, as Cartwright wrote in her autobiography ''[[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]'', "the producers were still putting together this ensemble of [actors] and, come Monday, at the recording, she was nowhere to be found and the part was assigned to me. I didn't have time to ask why and I still don't have a clue."&lt;ref name="cartwright102"&gt;{{cite book |title= [[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]|last= Cartwright|first= Nancy|authorlink= Nancy Cartwright|chapter=Lady, That Ain't No Gutterball!|pages=102–103|year= 2000|publisher=[[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]]|isbn=0-7868-8600-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright also commented that when she first found out she would be voicing Nelson, "I asked myself, 'What does a bully sound like?' Well... what you hear is what you get. When I first uttered, 'I'll get you after school, man!' I let out a sigh of relief when I got through the line and a double-sigh when it got a laugh."&lt;ref name="cartwright102"/&gt;

By the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''The Simpsons'', the [[List of writers of The Simpsons|writers]] had begun to explore the secondary characters of the show. "[[Lisa's Date with Density]]" (season eighth, 1996) was the first episode to center around Nelson and was used to explain why he acts the way he does. The idea of Nelson dating [[Lisa Simpson]] had already been around for a while, but this was the first time that the staff worked it into the show.&lt;ref&gt;Scully, Mike; Weinstein, Josh (2007). Commentary for the episode "[[Lisa's Date with Density]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright said in 2012 that she thinks Nelson "has evolved the most out of all the characters I do. There's a soft spot in him that the writers have found. He's got this special attraction to Marge, and he sings these songs, and he's got a crush on Lisa. There's something about this poor kid&amp;nbsp;– his mother works at Hooters, his dad went out to buy milk and never came back. I wouldn't want him to come over for dinner, but I really love doing his voice."&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Stacey|title='The Simpsons' at 500: Untold Stories|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/simpsons-500-episodes-conan-obrien-matt-groening-287864?page=2|accessdate=2012-02-08|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved on 2008-07-11&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of the season 22 episode "[[Loan-a Lisa]]", Rowan Kaiser of [[The A.V. Club]] commented that Nelson's character has undergone a "[[tvtropes:BadassDecay|Spikeification]]", in reference to the bully's near-exclusive portrayal as being likable and vulnerable in later seasons of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/loanalisacleveland-liveexcellence-in-broadcasting1,45839/|title="Loan-a-Lisa"/"Cleveland Live!"/"Excellence in Broadcasting"/"100 A.D., Pt 1 of 2"|last=Kaiser|first=Rowan|work=[[The A.V.

==In popular culture==
* In 2016, independent recording artist, @Kendallisall, used a photo of Nelson for the cover of his single "Ha Ha" released to [[SoundCloud]], which received 22.4 thousand streams. This trend was followed by artists DDG ("Lettuce"), [[Famous Dex]] ("Ok Dexter"), [[Rich the Kid]] (''[[Rich Forever 3]]'') and [[Ugly God]] ("[[Water (Ugly God song)|Water]]"), who's single covers depicted re-imagined interpretations of characters from other animated television series.

'''Ovide William Mercredi''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|OM}} (born January 30, 1946) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[politician]]. He is [[Cree]] and a former National Chief of the [[Assembly of First Nations]]. He was elected president of the [[Manitoba New Democratic Party]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="Ovide Mercredi elected president of Manitoba NDP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ovide Mercredi elected president of Manitoba NDP|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/ovide-mercredi-elected-president-of-manitoba-ndp-1.2985855|work=CBC News|date=March 7, 2015|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Mercredi attended the [[University of Manitoba]] and graduated with a degree in law in 1977. While a student he became President of the first [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|native]] students' association formed in [[Canada]]. He was elected Regional Chief of the Assembly of First Nations for [[Manitoba]] in 1989. Mercredi had specialized in constitutional law, and became a key strategist{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} for the Assembly during the time of the [[Meech Lake Accord]] constitutional reform discussions. He also had a strong leadership role in resolving the [[Oka Crisis]].

Mercredi was elected as National Chief for the Assembly of First Nations, the national political body representing over 600 [[First Nations]] [[tribal chief|chief]]s across Canada. During his first term, Mercredi played a major role in the [[Charlottetown Accord]] constitutional discussions.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He was re-elected as National Chief in 1994, and served until 1997. As National Chief, Mercredi addressed the [[United Nations]] in both [[Geneva]] and [[New York City|New York]]. He also led a Canadian delegation to the troubled area of the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]].

In addition to serving as a [[lawyer]] and politician, Mercredi is a noted author.{{peacock inline|date=August 2016}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He co-wrote, with Justice Mary Ellen Turpel Lafond, the 1993 book ''In The Rapids: Navigating the Future of First Nations''.

Mercredi is an advocate of non-violent methods for change and has been nominated by the Government of [[India]] for the [[Gandhi Peace Prize]]. He has also received honorary law degrees from [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)|Saint Mary's University]] and [[Bishop's University]].

== Career since his national chiefship ==
In April 2005, Mercredi announced he would challenge [[Bev Desjarlais]] for the [[New Democratic Party]] nomination in the riding of [[Churchill (electoral district)|Churchill]] for the next [[Canadian federal election, 2006|federal election]], but he later withdrew his candidacy.

In May 2007, Mercredi along with his fellow Manitoba chiefs began seeking compensation from [[Manitoba Telecom Services]] for every cellphone signal that passes through First Nations land, saying the airspace should be considered a resource like land and water. Mercredi was quoted as saying, "When it comes to using airspace, it's like using our water and simply because there's no precedent doesn't mean that it's not the right thing to do."

He is the former chancellor of [[University College of the North]] in northern Manitoba, and delivered his inaugural address at a ceremony on November 6, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2009, Ovide Mercredi received an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Letters]] degree from [[Athabasca University]].&lt;ref name="Doctor"&gt;''Edmonton Journal'', page B4, June 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athabascau.ca/convocation/about/HRdocs.php AU Convocation] Honorary Doctorates&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercredi became Chief of the [[Misipawistik Cree Nation]] and served his community from 2005 to 2011.

In 2012, Mercredi endorsed [[Sheila Copps]]' bid for the presidency of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rabson |first=Mia |date=January 5, 2012 |title=Local Liberals pin hopes on former MP |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/local-liberals-pin-hopes-on-former-mp-136722093.html |newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press |access-date=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Ovide Mercredi received the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Manitoba.

He was elected president of the [[Manitoba New Democratic Party]] on March 7, 2015.&lt;ref name="Ovide Mercredi elected president of Manitoba NDP"/&gt; While now the president of a political party, he has previously publicly questioned the utility of voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=King |first=Hayden |date=August 21, 2015 |title=3 reasons why First Nations voters are suddenly more engaged |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/aboriginal/3-reasons-why-first-nations-voters-are-suddenly-more-engaged-1.3198052 |work=CBC News |access-date=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Hilmar Jensen''' (28 April 1930 – 17 July 2004),&lt;ref&gt;[http://stamps.org/HOF-2005#Jensen Paul Hilmar Jensen.] [[American Philatelic Society]], ''Hall of Fame'', 2013. Retrieved 17 May 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6GgA2RvIl Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; was a Norwegian [[Philately|philatelist]] whose collections often won gold at philatelic shows, and whose work in community service in the field of philately was recognized  by [[King Harald V of Norway]].

==Collecting interests==
Jensen had wide knowledge of the entire field of philately but specialized in the collection and study of postage stamps and postal history of certain countries, especially [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Cook Islands]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Norway]].  His exhibits at various stamp shows generally won the gold prize.

==Philatelic activity==
Jensen was a founder and the first president of the ''Norwegian Postal History Society'', served as president of the ''Norwegian Philatelic Federation'' and the ''FIP Postal History Commission''. He was also named vice president of the Norwegian philatelic exhibition  NORWEX 1980 and later secretary general of NORWEX 1997. 

Along with Patrick Pearson and [[Robert P. Odenweller]], Jensen was co-author of the ''F.I.P. Guide to Exhibiting and Judg-ing Traditional and Postal History Exhibits'', published in 1993. Jensen was also a noted speaker on philatelic subjects, and dedicated efforts to introduce youth into the hobby of stamp collecting.

==Honors and awards==
Jensen received many awards and recognition, especially a notable one by [[King Harald V of Norway]] for his philatelic efforts. He signed the [[Roll of Distinguished Philatelists]] in 1988 and received awards which included: the Anderssen-Dethloff Medal of Norway, the Copenhagen Philatelic Club Medal, the [[Lichtenstein Medal]], the FIP Medal of Service, and the Golden Lion of the Norwegian Philatelic Federation.

'''Percy Edmund Creed Coleman''' (23 October 1892 &amp;ndash; 25 May 1934) was an [[Australia]]n union organiser and politician. Born at [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]] in [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]] to Thomas Coleman and Ellen, née Creed, Coleman was orphaned when still a young child and, after a [[New Zealand]] education, went to sea at the age of 13. After three years, he was a clerk with the Sydney branch of the [[Federated Seamen's Union of Australasia]], and by 1916 he was general secretary of the United Clerks' Union of New South Wales.

==Military service==

Despite his opposition to [[conscription]], Coleman enrolled with the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] in February 1918 and served with the [[Army Service Corps]] in [[France]] and [[England]]. Having been promoted to temporary sergeant by 1919, he became attached to [[Australia House]] as a lecturer. He was discharged from the armed forces in April 1920.

==Politics==

Coleman toured the [[United States|United States of America]] as a lecturer in 1920, and returned as secretary of the renamed Australian Clerical Association, a post he retained until 1922. He was also a founder and secretary of the Australian Alliance of Professional, Clerical and Government Employees' Associations.

Coleman's standing in the union movement led him to be selected as the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] candidate for the new seat of [[Division of Reid|Reid]] in 1922, an endeavour in which he was successful. He became known as a strong supporter of the [[League of Nations]]. Despite some negative publicity, during which he was called before a royal commission to testify with regard to apparent bribes made to some Labor members, Coleman easily held his seat in 1925 and 1929.

Although he did not rise to become a minister in [[James Scullin]]'s government, Coleman was appointed as the Australian representative at the [[International Labour Conference]] and the [[League of Nations Mandates]] Commission meeting in [[Geneva, Switzerland|Geneva]], as well as the British Commonwealth Labour Conference in [[London]]. He was again embroiled in controversy when he was accused of accepting a ₤500 bribe during an enquiry into the broadcasting stations, but was cleared of all charges. In 1931, Coleman, who had remained loyal to Scullin's Labor, was defeated in his seat by the [[Lang Labor]] candidate, [[Joe Gander]], and became a strong opponent of [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]]'s "dictatorship" in [[New South Wales]]. Although he attempted to re-enter parliament via a by-election for the seat of [[Division of East Sydney|East Sydney]] in 1932, he was forced to withdraw due to sickness, and was also narrowly unsuccessful in his bid to enter the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] by contesting Lang's own seat of [[Electoral district of Auburn|Auburn]]. Admitted to the bar in 1933, he became president of the New South Wales (Federal) branch of the Australian Labor Party, but died unexpectedly on 25 May 1934 while in a car at [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]]. It was later determined that the cause was [[heart disease]].

Coleman had married Elsie Allen Victoria Prince on 17 December 1921 in Sydney; he was survived by her and their daughter.

'''''Ragnar Lodbrok''''' or '''Lothbrok''' ({{lang-non|Ragnarr Loþbrók}}, "Ragnar shaggy breeches", contemporary Icelandic: ''Ragnar Loðbrók'') is a legendary{{sfn|Magnusson|2008|p=106}}{{sfn|Harrison|1993|p=16}} [[Norsemen|Norse]] [[Viking]] hero and ruler, known from [[Viking Age]] [[Old Norse poetry]] and [[legendary saga|sagas]]. According to that traditional literature, Ragnar distinguished himself by many raids against [[Francia]] and [[Anglo-Saxon England]] during the 9th century. There is no known evidence to substantiate that he actually existed under this name and outside of the mythology associated with him.

== The Viking Sagas ==
[[File:Rayner Lothbroc &amp; Kraka by August Malmström c 1880.jpg|thumb|Ragnar receives [[Aslaug|Kráka]] (Aslaug), as imagined by [[August Malmström]].]]
[[File:Ragnar Lodbroks död by Hugo Hamilton.jpg|thumb|19th century artist's impression of Ælla of Northumbria's execution of Ragnar Lodbrok]]
According to the [[Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok]], Ragnar was the son of the Swedish king [[Sigurd Hring]].  

The [[Hervarar saga]] tells that when [[Valdar]] died, his son [[Randver]] became the king of Sweden, while [[Harald Wartooth]] became the king of Denmark. Then Harald conquered all of his grandfather [[Ivar Vidfamne]]'s territory. After Randver's death, his son Sigurd Hring became the king of Sweden, presumably as the subking of Harald. Sigurd Hring and Harald fought the Battle of the Brávellir ([[Bråvalla]]) on the plains of Östergötland, where Harald and many of his men died. Sigurd ruled Sweden and Denmark from about 770 until his death in about 804. He was succeeded by his son Ragnar Lodbrok. Harald Wartooth's son [[Eysteinn Beli]] ruled Sweden as Ragnar's viceroy until he was killed by the sons of Ragnar.

The [[Tale of Ragnar's Sons]] tells that the [[Great Heathen Army]] that invaded England in 865 was led by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, to wreak revenge against King [[Ælla of Northumbria]] who had supposedly captured and executed Ragnar.

== Frankish accounts of a 9th century Viking leader named Ragnar ==

The [[Siege of Paris (845)|Siege of Paris]] and the Sack of Paris of 845 was the culmination of a Viking invasion of the kingdom of the West Franks. The Viking forces were led by a Norse chieftain named "Reginherus", or Ragnar.{{Sfn | Kohn | 2006 | p = 588}}  This Ragnar has often been tentatively identified with the legendary saga figure Ragnar Lodbrok, but the accuracy of this remains a disputed issue among historians.{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 | p = 212}}{{Sfn | Sprague | 2007 | p = 225}}  Around 841, Ragnar had been awarded land in [[Turholt]], Frisia, by Charles the Bald, but he eventually lost the land as well as the favour of the King.{{Sfn | Sawyer | 2001 | p = 40}}  Ragnar's Vikings raided Rouen on their way up the Seine in 845,{{Sfn | Duckett | 1988 | p = 181}}  and in response to the invasion, determined not to let the royal [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of Saint-Denis]] (near Paris) be destroyed,{{Sfn | Duckett | 1988 | p = 181}} Charles assembled an army which he divided into two parts, one for each side of the river.{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 |  p = 212}}  Ragnar attacked and defeated one of the divisions of the smaller Frankish army, took 111 of their men as prisoners and hanged them on an island on the Seine.{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 | p = 212}}  This was done to honour the [[Norse religion|Norse god]] [[Odin]],{{Sfn | Kohn | 2006 | p = 588}} as well as to incite terror in the remaining Frankish forces.{{Sfn | Jones | 2001 | p = 212}}

== Ragnar's sons ==

The [[Great Heathen Army]] is said to have been led by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, to wreak revenge against King [[Ælla of Northumbria]] who had supposedly executed Ragnar in 865 by casting him into a pit full of snakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/history-famous-people/ragnar-lothbrok-ferocious-viking-hero-became-myth-008177|title=Ragnar Lothbrok: The Ferocious Viking Hero that Became a Myth|last=Karasavvas|first=Theodoros|work=Ancient Origins|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Heathen Army was organized and led by the brothers [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Ubba]], [[Halfdan Ragnarsson|Halfdan]], [[Björn Ironside]], [[Hvitserk]], and [[Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye]]. The first four are known historical figures.{{sfn|Holman|2003|p=220}}

Ivar the Boneless was the leader of the Great Heathen Army from 865 to 870, but he disappears from English historical accounts after 870&lt;ref&gt; Forte, Angelo; Oram, Richard; Pedersen, Frederik (2005-05-30). Viking Empires (First ed.). Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|9780521829922}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-82992-2}}. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;. A great number of Viking warriors arrived from Scandinavia, as part of the Great Summer Army, led by King [[Bagsecg]] of Denmark, bolstering the ranks of Halfdan's army&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, Nicholas Hooper; Bennett, Matthew (1996). The Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare: the Middle Ages. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-44049-1}}. p.22&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]], the Danes battled the West Saxons nine times, including the [[Battle of Ashdown]] on 8 January 871, where Bagsecg was killed&lt;ref&gt;Costambeys, M (2004). "Hálfdan (d. 877)". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press. doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/49260&lt;/ref&gt;. Halfdan accepted a truce from the future [[Alfred the Great]], newly crowned king of Wessex&lt;ref&gt;Forte, A; Oram, RD; Pedersen, F (2005). Viking Empires. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-82992-2}}. p. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Halfdan succeeded Bagsecg as King of most of Denmark ([[Jutland]] and [[Wendland]]) in about 871. Bjorn Ironside became King of Sweden and Uppsala in about 865, (the same year his father Ragnar is said to have died). Bjorn had two sons, Refil and [[Erik Björnsson]]. His son Erik became the next king of Sweden, and was succeeded in turn by [[Erik]] the son of Refil. Sigurd Snake-in-the-eye became King of [[Zealand]] and the Danish Isles in about 871, and also succeeded his brother Halfdan as King of Denmark in about 877.

== Sources and historicity ==
[[File:Rayner Lothbroc Saga by Norstedts 1880.jpg|thumb|The saga as published by [[Norstedts]] in a large-size illustrated version (1880).]]
Whereas Ivar the Boneless and Halfdan Ragnarsson are widely considered to have been actual historical figures, opinion regarding their supposed father is divided, but stories about him are mostly believed to be fictional. According to [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]], writing in 1979: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Certain scholars in recent years have come to accept at least part of Ragnar's story as based on historical fact."&lt;ref&gt;Davidson p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; A generation later, however, Katherine Holman, writing in 2003, expressed the more nuanced contemporary opinion: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Although his sons are
historical figures, there is no evidence that Ragnar himself ever lived, and he seems to be an amalgam of several different historical figures and pure literary invention."&lt;ref name="Z"&gt;Holman 2003 p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to traditional sources, Ragnar (possibly as a literary composite) was:
* married three times, to the [[shieldmaiden]] [[Lagertha]], the noblewoman [[Þóra Borgarhjǫrtr|Thóra Borgarhjǫrtr]] and [[Aslaug]] (also known as Kráka, Kraba), a Norse queen
* the father of historical Viking figures including [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Björn Ironside]], [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]], [[Hvitserk]], [[Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye]] and [[Ubba]]{{sfn|Holman|2003|p=220}}
* captured by King [[Ælla of Northumbria]] and died after Ælla had him thrown into a [[snakepit|pit of snakes]]
* avenged by the [[Great Heathen Army]] that invaded and occupied [[Northumbria]] and adjoining Anglo-Saxon kingdoms{{sfn|Holman|2003|p=220}}

The most significant medieval sources that mention Ragnar include:
* Book IX of the ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', a 12th-century work by the Christian Danish chronicler [[Saxo Grammaticus]]
* the ''[[Tale of Ragnar's Sons|Tale of Ragnar's sons]]'' (''Ragnarssona þáttr''), a [[legendary saga]]
* the ''[[Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok]]'', another saga, a sequel to the ''[[Völsunga saga]]''
* the ''[[Ragnarsdrápa]]'', a [[skaldic poem]] of which only fragments remain, attributed to the 9th-century poet [[Bragi Boddason]]
* the ''[[Krákumál]]'', Ragnar's death-song, a 12th-century Scottish skaldic poem

The extent of Ragnar's [[historicity]] is not clear.

In her commentary on [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]]'s ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', Davidson notes that Saxo's coverage of Ragnar's legend in book IX of the ''Gesta'' appears to be an attempt to consolidate many of the confusing and contradictory events and stories known to the chronicler into the reign of one king, Ragnar. That is why many acts ascribed to Ragnar in the ''Gesta'' can be associated, through other sources, with various figures, some of whom are more historically tenable. These candidates for the "historical Ragnar" include:
* the ''Reginherus'' or ''Ragnar'' who [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieged Paris]] in the mid-9th century
* King [[Horik I]] (d. 854)
* King [[Reginfrid]] (d. 814), a king who ruled part of Denmark and came into conflict with [[Harald Klak]]
* possibly the [[Rognvald Eysteinsson|Ragnall]] (Rognvald) of the [[Irish Annals]]{{sfn|Davidson|1980|p=277}}

So far, attempts to firmly link the legendary Ragnar with one or several of those men have failed because of the difficulty in reconciling the various accounts and their chronology. Nonetheless, the core tradition of a Viking hero named Ragnar (or similar) who wreaked havoc in mid-[[9th-century]] Europe and who fathered many famous sons is remarkably persistent, and some aspects of it are covered by relatively reliable sources, such as the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

== In popular culture ==
Ragnar Lodbrok features prominently in:
* [[History (Canadian TV network)|History]]'s 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]''
* [[Edwin Atherstone]]'s novel ''Sea-Kings in England''
* [[Edison Marshall]]'s 1951 novel ''The Viking''

'''Robert Moussallem''' met with [[FBI]] and [[IRS]] agents in October 1988 to initiate a [[sting operation]] to catch [[Birmingham, Alabama]], [[mayor]] [[Richard Arrington]] and other [[African-American]] city officials to accept bribes, in lieu of indictment for Moussallem's bribing an IRS agent. The repeated attempts to trap Arrington (dubbed 'Operation Bowtye') were unsuccessful and Moussallem, fearing betrayal, told Arrington why he had been meeting him. Shortly thereafter, Moussallem was indicted. Two days before his trip to Washington, he was shot in the face with a shotgun.

Although Arrington was never indicted by federal investigators, he brought Moussallem's story to the public and it brought public attention to a seemingly systematic targeting of black officials by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. U.S. Attorney Frank Donaldson dismissed these notions, saying "We're colorblind, and we simply follow the evidence where it leads"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974787,00.html?promoid=googlep Time, "Civil Rights: Let Me Out of Here!" by  Michael Riley Birmingham, 3 Feb. 1992; accessed 28 Jan. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and that Moussallem "was a twice-convicted felon.

'''Robert S. Corrington''' (born May 30, 1950)&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. Public Records Index'' Vol 1 (Provo, UT: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.), 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[philosopher]] and author of many books exploring human interpretation of the universe as well as biographies on [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]]. He is currently the Henry Anson Buttz Professor of [[Philosophical Theology]] at [[Drew University]] in [[Madison, New Jersey|Madison]], [[New Jersey]]. Before that he was a professor at [[Pennsylvania State University]].  He is a Senior Fellow of the American Institute for Philosophical and Cultural Thought.

Corrington is member of [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] and [[Theosophical Society|The Theosophical Society of America]] and a lecturer for both organizations, and he is also an affiliate of The [[Parapsychological Association]].

==Ecstatic naturalism==
Robert S. Corrington’s work contributes to philosophical and theological inquiry through the development of a perspective called 'ecstatic naturalism’. Ecstatic [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], also referred to as ‘deep [[pantheism]]’ or ‘[[religious naturalism]],’ has emerged through Corrington’s eleven books and over eighty articles on the subject. His influences are many and range across the disciplines of philosophy, theology, science, and psychology. Deep appreciation of the American philosophers [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[George Santayana]], [[Justus Buchler]] and [[John Dewey]] grounds Corrington’s insights in a [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] mode even as his work creatively extends this tradition philosophically through a psychologically sophisticated [[semiotics]] with the aid of [[Carl Jung]], [[Otto Rank]], [[Heinz Kohut]], and [[Julia Kristeva]] and theologically through liberal Protestant thinkers [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and [[Paul Tillich]] toward a Hindu-inspired Emersonian post-Christian nature spirituality. [[Ernst Bloch]] is another influence on Corrington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Corrington, Robert S. |title=Nature and Spirit: An Essay in Ecstatic Naturalism |publisher=Fordham University Press |location=New York |year=1992 |page=113 |isbn=0-8232-1363-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative to contemporary [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] perspectives that are either too dependent upon a brute descriptive [[materialism]] on the one hand or to an honorific process cosmology on the other, ecstatic naturalism, like all versions of naturalism, assumes that nature is all there is; there is no recourse made to supernaturalistic forces or entities. For Corrington, however, ‘nature’ does not refer to anything, but is the dynamic entirety, an extremely wide and deeply vast reality that creates itself out of itself alone. In order to effectively speak or theorize about nature, then, Corrington has picked up on “a distinction dear to [[Averroes]], [[Thomas of Aquinas]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (among others)” between [[natura naturans]] (nature naturing) and [[natura naturata]] (nature natured). (A Semiotic Theory p.&amp;nbsp;40) The perspective of ecstatic naturalism attempts to remain accountable to the insights of evolutionary sciences even as it probes ever deeper into those aspects of nature that elude strictly scientific inquiries. As a naturalist, Corrington is deeply suspicious of [[Teleology|teleological]] descriptions of nature and finds in [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]’s ‘will to life’ a foundational ‘intention’ in organisms which anticipates Darwinian explanations of life’s perpetuation.

==Bibliography==
Robert S. Corrington is the author of 12 books and 80 articles in the fields of philosophy, [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]], theology, [[psychoanalysis]], and semiotics as well as editor of several books on [[metaphysics]] and [[semiotics]]. He has also authored two plays.

'''Rudolf Bahro''' (November 18, 1935 – December 5, 1997) was a dissident from [[East Germany]] who, since his death, has been recognised as a philosopher, political figure and author. Bahro was a leader of the [[West Germany|West German]] party [[Alliance '90/The Greens|The Greens]], but became disenchanted with its political organization, left the party and explored spiritual approaches to [[sustainability]].

=={{anchor|Childhood and education}}Early life and education==
Bahro was the eldest of three children of Max Bahro, a livestock-industry consultant, and Irmgard Bahro (née Conrad). Until 1945, the family lived in [[Lower Silesia]]: first in the spa town of [[Bad Flinsberg]] and then in neighboring Gerlachsheim,&lt;ref&gt;This could refer to any of the three villages Ober Gerlachsheim ([[Grabiszyce Górne]]), Mittel Gerlachsheim ([[Grabiszyce Średnie]]), or Nieder Gerlachsheim ([[Grabiszyce Dolne]], all in then [[Lauban (district)|district Lauban]] [[:de:Landkreis Lauban|(de)]])&lt;/ref&gt; where Bahro attended the village school. Towards the end of [[World War II]] Max Bahro was drafted into the [[Volkssturm]],&lt;!-- it doesn't specify that in the German article, but it is plausible. --&gt; and, after his capture, detained as a Polish prisoner. As the Eastern Front approached, the family was evacuated and Bahro was separated from his mother and siblings during the flight (the rest of Bahro's family, with the exception of his father, died of [[typhoid]] soon afterwards). Bahro lived with an aunt in Austria and Hesse, spending several months in each location and eventually reuniting with his father, who was managing a widow's farm in Rießen (now part of [[Siehdichum]]).

From 1950 to 1954, Bahro attended high school in Fürstenberg (now part of [[Eisenhüttenstadt]]). Since it was assumed that all high-school students would join the [[Free German Youth]] (FDJ), Bahro reluctantly joined in 1950. This was, as he later commented, the only time he did something against his will under pressure. In 1952 he applied for membership in the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED), which he joined in 1954. Bahro was regarded as intelligent, and graduated from high school with honors. He attended [[Humboldt University]] in Berlin from 1954 to 1959 and studied philosophy. Among his teachers were [[Kurt Hager]] (who later became the philosopher of the SED), [[Georg Klaus]] and [[:de:Wolfgang Heise|Wolfgang Heise]]. The topic of his thesis was "[[Johannes R. Becher]] and the relationship of the German working class and its party to the national question of our people".

Until 1956, Bahro was an admirer of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]; Khrushchev's leaked "[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|secret speech]]" in February 1956 changed his views. He followed the [[Polish October]] and the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] with great interest, expressed his solidarity with the insurgents in a [[wall newspaper]] and openly criticized the restricted-information policy of the GDR leadership. As a result of his views, [[Stasi|national security]] spied on him for two years.

=={{anchor|The party workers}}Party work==
After passing the [[Staatsexamen|government licensing examination]], the SED sent Bahro to Sachsendorf (a part of [[Lindendorf]]). He edited a local newspaper, ''Die Linie'' (''The Line'') and encouraged the area's farmers to join the [[landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaft|LPG agricultural cooperative]]. In 1959 Bahro married Gundula Lambke, a Russian language teacher. The couple had two daughters (one of whom died at birth) and a son, in addition to Gundula's daughter. In 1960 Bahro was appointed to the party leadership of the [[University of Greifswald]], where he founded the ''Unsere Universität'' ("Our University") newspaper and served as editor-in-chief. The same year saw the publication of his first book, a collection of poems entitled ''In dieser Richtung'' (''In This Direction''). Beginning in 1962, Bahro worked as a consultant for the Corporate Executive Committee of the Union of Science (one of the divisions of the [[Free German Trade Union Federation]]) in Berlin; in 1965 he was appointed deputy chief of the [[Free German Youth|Freie Deutsche Jugend (FDJ)]] student magazine, ''Forum''. During Bahro's tenure with the FDJ he was hampered by conflict with the increasingly restrictive policies of the SED, which made him a target of criticism. Due to the unauthorized publication of an article by [[Volker Braun]],&lt;ref&gt;The Germany article gives "Kipper Paul Bauch" as the name of the piece, but this name doesn't make sense, and it doesn't appear in [[:de:Volker Braun]].&lt;/ref&gt; Bahro was dismissed as deputy chief in 1967.

=={{anchor|The path to ''The Alternative''}}Evolution of ideas==
From 1967 to 1977 Bahro worked for a number of companies in the rubber and plastics industry as an [[organization development]] specialist. Seeing conditions in the factories soon brought him to the conclusion that the East German economy was in a crisis and the primary reason for this was that workers had little voice in the workplace. He expressed this view in a December 1967 letter to the Chairman of the State Council, [[Walter Ulbricht]], proposing a transfer of workplace responsibility to the workers with [[grassroots democracy]]. A few weeks later, the [[Prague Spring]] began; Bahro took a lively interest, supported the movement. In May 1968 he was interviewed by a member of the [[Central Committee]], who made it clear that his solidarity with the "counter-revolution" was no longer tolerated. This led Bahro to develop his ideas systematically, and to publish them. His decision was reinforced by the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] on August 21. This was, as Bahro later said, "the blackest day" of his life and the reason for his final break with the SED. He decided not to make the break publicly, to protect his book project.

In 1972 Bahro began part-time work on his dissertation on development conditions of high-school and technical-college groups in the [[Volkseigener Betrieb|VEBs]] (state-owned enterprises of the GDR). At the same time, he secretly wrote a thematically broader manuscript which later became ''The Alternative''. In 1973, Gundula filed for divorce; both spouses said later this was as a precautionary measure to protect the children against government reprisals. However, in 1974 Gundula informed state security about the secret book project and handed over a copy of the manuscript; after that, Bahro was under [[surveillance]].

In 1975 Bahro submitted his dissertation at the [[:de:Technische Hochschule Leuna-Merseburg|Technische Hochschule Leuna-Merseburg]], which was evaluated favorably by three reviewers. The Stasi intervened, engineering two opposing reviews. His work on ''The Alternative'' was unhindered, but Bahro was convinced that he would be unable to disseminate his book to the GDR citizenry. In December 1976 he learned that one of his [[samizdat]]s had fallen into Stasi hands, which prompted him to finish his work quickly. Intermediaries arranged a contract with Europäische Verlagsanstalt, a West German publisher. Swiss musicologist [[:de:Harry Goldschmidt|Harry Goldschmidt]] smuggled the finished manuscript into West Berlin, and copies of the manuscript reached individuals in the GDR by mail.

Later in West Germany, Bahro said that the theoretical bases for ''The Alternative'' were [[Karl August Wittfogel]]'s "Oriental Despotism" and earlier Marxist works. He was unable to cite Wittfogel because of the latter's anticommunism. Wittfogel also influenced Bahro's later ecological work.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}&lt;!--this is not part of the German article, but was added by [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rudolf_Bahro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=433545460] --&gt;

=={{anchor|''The Alternative'' (Book)}}''The Alternative''==
''The Alternative'' is divided into three parts:
# The non-capitalist path to an industrial society
# Anatomy of socialism
# Strategy for a communist alternative
The introduction begins with the premise that the [[communist society|Communist movement]] did not lead to the theoretically expected situation, but instead continued on the capitalist path with only superficial changes. "[[Social alienation|Alienation]] and the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern mentality]] of the working masses continue on a new level." The book analyzes the reasons for this, and offers solutions.

The first part is a historical analysis of the development of [[socialism]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. Bahro concludes that in the Soviet Union (and, consequently, also in countries such as the GDR) not the theoretically expected socialism but a form of proto-socialism had emerged. For the reason, he posits that at the time of the [[October Revolution]] the Soviet Union was far from the stage of development presumed in [[Marx's theory of history]]. Nevertheless, the path chosen by Lenin was correct. Bahro regards Stalin's subsequent [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)|massive industrialization]] as a necessary development, justifying the [[Great Purge|party purge]] as inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Guntolf Herzberg, Kurt Seifert: Rudolf Bahro – Glaube an das Veränderbare, Taschenbuch-Ausgabe Berlin 2005, page 177f&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second part Bahro analyzes the existing [[social system]], which he believes was incorrectly called "[[real socialism]]" when in reality it was still a [[class society]]. He detailed how this society worked, and argues that this provided the rationale for the observed economic stagnation.

In the third part he developed solutions, including a call for a new revolution which would transform not only the social circumstances but the people. Its intention is to overcome the subaltern mentality, the "form of existence and way of thinking of ordinary people." He demanded the abolition of the division of labor; all should participate in science, art and menial work.

=={{anchor|Responses to ''The Alternative''}}Response==
On 22 August 1977 the West German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' published an extract from ''The Alternative''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Das trifft den Parteiapparat ins Herz. Ein SED-Funktionär kritisiert den DDR-Sozialismus|language=German|trans-title=That's gonna hit the heart of the party. An SED functionary criticises GDR socialism.|date=22 August 1977|newspaper=DerSpiegel|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-40763980.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an interview with Bahro, during which he admitted writing the book. The next day, Bahro was arrested and taken to the [[Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial|Berlin-Hohenschönhausen]] prison. That evening, West German television stations ARD and ZDF broadcast Bahro's interview.

In early September, the book went on sale. The first edition was sold out before delivery, and was translated into other languages. ''The Alternative'' sparked debate in the West European left about the nature of socialism. For [[Herbert Marcuse]], Bahro's book was "the most important contribution to Marxist theory and practice that has appeared in recent decades"; a similar view was expressed by the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] [[Ernest Mandel]]. To Lawrence Krader, Bahro was the "conscience of the revolution, the strength of the truth". [[Rudi Dutschke]] was critical, classifying Bahro as detached from Leninism with too little respect for human rights and calling his suggestions "totally unrealistic".

These analyses were accompanied by a broad wave of publicly expressed solidarity with Bahro, climaxing in a letter by [[Heinrich Böll]] and [[Günter Grass]] in ''[[The Times]]'' on 1 February 1978 which was also signed by [[Arthur Miller]], [[Graham Greene]], Carol Stern, [[Mikis Theodorakis]] and other celebrities. In the GDR, however, Bahro's recognition was suppressed and he was told nothing of the reaction to his book and subsequent arrest. About half of the copies of ''The Alternative'' which Bahro had posted shortly before his arrest in the GDR were intercepted by the authorities. His influence of East German students was limited.&lt;ref&gt;Natalia Tsvetkova. Failure of American and Soviet Cultural Imperialism in German Universities, 1945-1990. Boston, Leiden: Brill, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

To write and publish a book was, in itself, legal in the GDR; however, Bahro was accused of working for the West German intelligence service (from whom he was thought to have obtained his information). On 30 June 1978 Bahro was convicted ''in camera'' of treason and betraying state secrets, and sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. Evidence indicates a [[kangaroo court]], with a predetermined verdict; an appeal to the Supreme Court of the GDR filed by defense attorney [[Gregor Gysi]] was summarily rejected as unfounded.

The verdict immediately sparked violent protests and expressions of solidarity in the West. The Committee for the Release of Rudolf Bahro organized an international conference, held 16 to 19 November 1978 in [[West Berlin]] and attended by over 2,000 participants. The depth of solidarity is illustrated by an appeal to the State Council of the GDR in the ''[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]'' of 11 May 1979, organized by Bahro Committee in 12 countries and signed by a number of celebrities. Bahro was awarded the [[Carl von Ossietzky]] Medal by the [[International League for Human Rights]] and made a member of the Swedish and Danish chapters of [[PEN International]].

On 11 October 1979, the 30th anniversary of the founding of the GDR, Bahro was granted amnesty. On 17 October he was deported with his former wife, their two children and his partner Ursula Beneke to the Federal Republic of Germany, in accordance with his July request.

=={{anchor|Work in West Germany}}West German work==
In West Germany Bahro soon joined the nascent Greens party, making a commitment to unite socialist and [[:de:Wertkonservatismus|"wertkonservative"]] currents in the new party since compromise was a necessity. A 1980 book formulated elements of a new policy: the relationship between [[ecology]] and socialism. Breaking from his position in ''The Alternative'', Bahro now felt that classical Marxism was no longer appropriate.

Another new motif in Bahro's thinking was religion. While in custody he had studied the Bible, and when he moved to the west he noticed unhappiness in spite of material prosperity. He interpreted this as a lack of introspection and transcendence, rejecting the traditionally materialistic outlook of socialism. The goal of human emancipation, represented (in different ways) by Karl Marx and Jesus Christ. In this context, Bahro referred to early Christianity and [[liberation theology]].

At the beginning of 1980, Bahro studied with [[Oskar Negt]] at the [[University of Hanover]]. His thesis appeared as a book, ''A Plea for Creative Initiative''. In 1983, he earned his [[habilitation]] in social philosophy.

In 1982, Bahro adopted a more radical position due to the contemporary economic crisis. He advocated a restructuring of society in economic, environmental and social-policy terms, which should be linked to a broad retreat from the world market and a move away from capitalist industry. Bahro also became involved in the [[peace movement]], advocating a [[nuclear-free Europe]].

Bahro's Dare Commune was an alternative community during the early days of the Greens. He believed that the transformation of society must begin on a small scale, requiring a change in the people themselves and a rediscovery of spirituality. Bahro was influenced by the Congregation of the [[Benedictine]]s and the mystical experience of God.

In 1981 Bahro visited the [[Korean People's Democratic Republic]], where he was received as a guest of the state. He saw this as his most important trip, to a state he admired with a system "to satisfy all the basic requirements of security". As part of a lecture tour of the United States in summer 1983, Bahro enjoyed several weeks at [[Rajneeshpuram]] with [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]] (Osho).

After the Green Party entered the [[Bundestag]] for the first time in March 1983, the question arose whether they would join a coalition with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (the SPD) or remain in opposition. Bahro strongly favored the latter option (which placed him in opposition to [[Joschka Fischer]]), and believed in renewal rather than reform. In his December 1984 "Hamburg speech", Bahro made a comparison with the political and social situation in the [[Weimar Republic]]: At that time, there had also been a broad movement in society which was dissatisfied with prevailing conditions and wanted change. What mattered now was to prevent the errors and political disasters of the past. In the Weimar Republic, the "brown" pole of the political spectrum (the [[Nazi]]s) overpowered the left with "nationalist mythology in disguise; therefore, resistance to capitalist development" could not begin. Bahro's "popular uprising" could occur this time without violence, but it was important that the Greens "are not lost" in the system. Bahro also called for the conquest of the right-left divide; to escape its minority position, the Greens should also "penetrate the territory of the [[Bavarian CSU]]". Bahro's Hamburg speech ended with the allegation that Joschka Fischer's supporters had a lust for power, a situation that could lead to civil war and subsequent dictatorship.

During the summer of 1985 Bahro left the Greens and focused on his new book, which was published in 1987 as ''Logic of Salvation''. In it he described a "logic of self-extermination" and its consequences for humanity at present, presenting a "logic of life" requiring a "leap in consciousness" and a withdrawal from the industrial "mega-machine". It was important to implement a "rescue policy", before the worsening environmental crisis leads to an emergency government. Bahro called for long-term goals, the elimination of short-term tactics and government decentralization. He advocated an "invisible church", which would provide the necessary spiritual dimension. As a conservative on the left, he noted common ground with [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] politician and critic [[Kurt Biedenkopf]]. Inspired by Mikhail Gorbachev's ''perestroika'', Bahro hoped for a "prince of environmental change" and suggested the establishment of a consensus-oriented body similar to the British [[House of Lords]]. The book met a mostly negative response, and Bahro's references to a prince and an invisible church were criticized.

In 1986, Bahro held "learning workshops" at his home in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], which featured discussion of his ideas and meditation. He met Beatrice Ingermann, who had been conducting a similar project since 1983 that was also a community in the Eifel. Bahro joined her group; they married in 1988, and had a daughter.

==In Berlin after the fall of the Wall==
Seeing the [[Die Wende|rapid decline of the GDR]], at the end of 1989 Bahro went to [[East Berlin]] to fight against the feared  "sellout of the GDR," its absorption by the Federal Republic. He wanted to work to ensure that the regime could keep its autonomy and maintain what he thought was its greatest political achievement: the primacy of politics over economics.

On 16 December 1989, Bahro had the opportunity of speaking to the assembled delegates of the extraordinary party conference of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], whose chairman had, a week ago, been his former legal counsel, Gysi. The main item on the agenda was whether the party should continue or be dissolved. What was finally decided was that the party should continue under a new name: Socialist Unity Party of Germany – Party of Democratic Socialism (German: Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands – Partei des Demokratischen Sozialismus, abbreviated SED-PDS). Bahro's request to address the conference as a guest speaker found only a slight majority (54%), and he was granted only 30 minutes, not the requested 45 minutes. Bahro was annoyed at this and had to improvise. After reading out the names of all the people who had helped him with his book, ''Die Alternative'', he criticized the previous speaker, Minister President and Deputy Party Chairman Hans Modrow, as well as Karl Marx, Gorbachev and [[Boris Yeltsin]]. He went on to present his vision of a "socio- ecological" restructuring of the GDR. His radical environmental ideas, which were hardly known in the GDR at that time, were far removed from the problems that interested the delegates, and his polemical introduction provoked fierce resentment. Bahro concluded that he no longer had anything in common with this party.

In the spring of 1990, he began setting up an "Institute for Social Ecology" at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. Instead of the usual discussion of the ecological crisis, he wanted this institute to address the issue holistically and, above all, study the deeper social and cultural causes of the crisis and develop practical alternatives. Bahro thus set up his own school of social science that is not to be confused with others that also go by the name of social ecology.

On 16 June 1990, again represented by Gysi, Bahro was rehabilitated by the Supreme Court of the GDR. On 15 September, shortly before the end of the GDR, the Minister of Education and Science appointed him associate professor of social ecology at Humboldt University. From the winter semester 1990/1991, Bahro regularly held lectures on issues of the environmental crisis, where he further developed the theories that he had put forward in his book ''Logik der Rettung'' (published in English as ''Avoiding social and ecological disaster: the politics of world transformation: an inquiry into the foundations of spiritual and ecological politics''). The lectures, to which he frequently invited guest speakers, were aimed at students in all years and also attracted an audience from outside the university. In the first years, the main lecture hall (''auditorium maximum'')  of the university was consistently full, and this also resulted in increased sales of his book on which the lectures were based. However, the Institute remained a temporary arrangement that could only exist thanks to financial support from the [[Schweisfurth Foundation]]. It was not until 1995 that the institute was integrated into the university as a working group of the Faculty of Agriculture and Horticulture.

In 1990, there were accusations that Bahro was striving for "eco-dictatorship". This accusation was made particularly aggressively by the ''Association for the Advancement of Psychological Knowledge of Human Nature'', an organization founded in Zurich which, in a work entitled ''The Fascism of the New Left'', claimed that Bahro's real goal was an "eco-fascist dictatorship". Bahro indignantly denied this but soon found himself confronted with more accusations of this nature. The accusations were based on quotations from his book ''Logik der Rettung''. In 1992, a former party colleague of his, [[Jutta Ditfurth]] joined the debate when, in her book ''Feuer in die Herzen'' [Putting Fire in the Hearts], she accused him of turning to esoteric, authoritarian and nationalist ideas.

In addition to his activities in Berlin, until 1991 Bahro also active in the ''Lernwerkstatt'' [Learning Workshop] a non-profit organization in [[Niederstadtfeld]], and he planned similar experiments with new sustainable living and economic systems in the former GDR. A conversation with the [[Minister-President of Saxony]], [[Kurt Biedenkopf]], in the summer of 1991 led to the socio-ecological futurology project ''LebensGut'' in the village of [[Pommritz]], near [[Bautzen]]. There, the socio-ecological research begun at the Humboldt University is also being continued, mainly by Bahro's former associate [[Maik Hosang]].

In September 1993, Bahro's wife Beatrice committed suicide following a marital dispute. He was so devastated that he had to cancel a semester of lectures. In the spring of 1994, he also became physically ill and in the autumn of that year he was diagnosed with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], a rare form of cancer. Bahro was convinced that his illness was the consequence of traumatic experiences such as the suicide of his wife and resisted conventional therapy, instead trying various alternative methods of diagnosis and therapy and temporarily moving into a monastery. Only after his condition deteriorated dramatically did he agree to another course of [[chemotherapy]]. In May 1995, on his sickbed, he married his girlfriend and companion Marina Lehnert, who had been caring for his daughter for some time.

After a year's break due to illness, in summer 1996 Bahro resumed teaching, but only to a limited extent. He gave his last lecture in July 1997. After that, he caught [[pneumonia]] and the cancer broke out again.

Rudolf Bahro died in Berlin on 5 December 1997 and was buried at the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]] in Berlin.

Some years after Bahro's death, suspicions were raised that his cancer and that of two other former political prisoners may have been caused by secret irradiation during detention.

'''Sara Riel''' (October 11, 1848 – December 27, 1883) was the first Métis [[Grey Nuns|Grey Nun]] from Red River.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was a highly educated and active member of the Catholic Church. She is best known as the sister of Métis leader [[Louis Riel]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Born in 1848 in the [[Red River Colony|Red River]] settlement to parents Jean-Louis Riel and Julie (Lagimodière) Riel, as a young child she was surrounded by the word of God, being educated by [[Sisters of Charity of Montreal]] but also by her mother, who was dedicated to the Christian faith.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was inspired to become a nun after her brother Louis Riel entered the [[seminary]] to become a priest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although Louis did not become a priest, Sara actively took her [[Solemn vows]] in 1868.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She taught languages and arts at the Grey Nuns boarding schools between 1868 and 1871, after which she became a Catholic missionary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Her family were active members in the Red River community right up to the Métis resistance. Although separated from her family, her writings showed a sympathetic view on the eve of the resistance. Given that her brother was an active member in leading the revolution against the government, in 1869 the congregation feared for her safety and she was moved several times within a few years.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Even though she took no active part in the cause, she provided support to her brother and a voice to the Métis of the local Catholic Churches. In 1871 she became the first Métis missionary from Red River and set off for [[Île-à-la-Crosse]] in northern Saskatchewan.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; In 1872 Sara Riel was taken ill and almost died, after a vision from God, Sara Riel changed her name to ‘Sister Marguerite-Marie of Alacoque’ and re-honored her vows and commitment to the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Sara actively wrote to her family telling them of her experiences, wishes, and hopes for them. She died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1884 at the age of 35.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Family ==

Sara Riel was born on October 11, 1848 in [[Red River Colony|Red River]], a small community settled originally through the fur trade and later expanded by the colonization of Lord Selkirk.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Ip86AAAAcAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=red+river+rebellion&amp;ots=Q_i0XCBRLD&amp;sig=h25WMuGn_lVs-yk7klPXT6mVdx0#v=onepage&amp;q=red%20river%20rebellion&amp;f=true|title=The Red River Settlement: its rise, progress, and present state|last=Ross|first=Alexander|date=1856|publisher=Schmith, Elder and Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Red River was a secluded place in the 1850s. It could only be reached by water, leaving it almost impossible to reach in the winter.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The [[North West Company]]’s fur trade was the primary economic resource of the region.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There were large alliances formed between the trader and the indigenous people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They taught each other important aspect of survival and adaptation with the [[Métis buffalo hunt|buffalo hunt]], agriculture, and medicine. Red River eventually became a place where retired fur traders could live with their families.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The new culture created in the settlement produced a generation of half settlers, half indigenous children known as the [[Métis in Canada|Métis]], who created their own unique culture.

Sara Riel's father was Jean-Louis Riel born in 1817, he was a [[voyageurs|voyageur]] for the North West Company.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=De ta soeur, Sara Riel|last=Jordan|first=Mary|publisher=Édition des Plaines|year=1980|isbn=0-920944-03-5|location=Saint-Boniface, Manitoba|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the 5th generation settler. His background was that of a French-Canadian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Red River, Jean-Louis Riel became a very important person within the growing Métis community. Jean-Louis Riel taught his children to be proud of their Métis heritage and to embrace their culture. He himself led many Métis revolts, including the one surrounding the [[Sayer trial|Sayer Trial]] in 1849.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sara and Louis Riel’s mother, Julie (Lagimodière) Riel was born in 1822 in French River.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was also from a French background that integrated with the Métis culture and passed on their traditions to their children.  Prior to marriage, Julie Lagimodière was planning to join the Grey Nuns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her parents chose the marriage to Jean-Louis Riel as a sense of financial and social security for their loving daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=C1PS3xjBK_oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Recollecting+:+Lives+of+Aboriginal+Woman+of+Canadian+North+West+and&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1pKeWvJTZAhWo34MKHd1ECckQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Recollecting%20:%20Lives%20of%20Aboriginal%20Woman%20of%20Canadian%20North%20West%20and&amp;f=false|title=Recollecting: Lives of Aboriginal Women of the Canadian Northwest and Borderlands|last=Carter|first=Sarah|last2=McCormack|first2=Patricia Alice|date=2011|publisher=Athabasca University Press|year=|isbn=9781897425824|location=|page=119|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sara Riel was the fourth child born to Jean-Louis and Julie Riel. The first born was Louis, followed by two children who did not make it past birth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=De ta soeur, Sara Riel|last=Jordan|first=Mary|publisher=Éditions des Plaines|year=1980|isbn=0-920944-03-5|location=Saint-Boniface, Manitoba|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sara was the next child born. This dynamic left a special bond between Louis and Sara as the two eldest children of the family. Altogether the Riel family consisted of 11 children but only 8 lived to adulthood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Riel family were members of the Red River elite and the children lived a more privileged life, very close to the Catholic Church, receiving the best education Red River had to offer. From the mid1840's till the late 1880s, the family went through hard economic times and had to sacrifice their prior way of living.

Education was important to the Riel family and was taken very seriously by Julie Riel, whom herself wanted to join the sisterhood prior to marriage. She taught her children the ways of the Catholic Church and to love God in their actions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Education ==
[[File:St. Boniface, Red River Settlement.png|thumb|left|St. Boniface Cathedral and the [[Le Musée de Saint-Boniface Museum|Grey Nuns' Convent]] in 1858]]

Sara Riel was educated by the Sisters of Charity boarding school in [[Saint Boniface, Winnipeg|St. Boniface]]. She excelled in many subjects including languages, art, and music. But she also learned household skills such as cooking and cleaning along with spin, knit, sewing, and embroidering.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=C1PS3xjBK_oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Recollecting+:+Lives+of+Aboriginal+Woman+of+Canadian+North+West+and&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1pKeWvJTZAhWo34MKHd1ECckQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Recollecting%20:%20Lives%20of%20Aboriginal%20Woman%20of%20Canadian%20North%20West%20and&amp;f=false|title=Recollecting: Lives of Aboriginal Women of the Canadian Northwest and Borderlands|last=Carter|first=Sarah|last2=McCormack|first2=Patricia Alice|date=2011|publisher=Athabasca University Press|year=|isbn=9781897425824|location=|page=121|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grey Nuns believed that orderliness and cleanliness of Métis were a representation of the schooling provided by the Church, therefore they encouraged the young girls to perfect their skills in household chores.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

She attended school in St. Boniface from 1858 until 1866 when she was chosen to join the Grey Nuns.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=C1PS3xjBK_oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Recollecting+:+Lives+of+Aboriginal+Woman+of+Canadian+North+West+and&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1pKeWvJTZAhWo34MKHd1ECckQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Recollecting%20:%20Lives%20of%20Aboriginal%20Woman%20of%20Canadian%20North%20West%20and&amp;f=false|title=Recollecting: Lives of Aboriginal Women of the Canadian Northwest and Borderlands|last=Carter|first=Sarah|last2=McCormack|first2=Patricia Alice|date=2011|publisher=Athabasca University Press|year=|isbn=9781897425824|location=|pages=115–116|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She entered the congregation in 1866. In 1868 she became the first Métis Grey Nun from Red River.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=De ta Soeur, Sara Riel|last=Jordan|first=Mary|publisher=Édition des Plaines|year=1980|isbn=0-920944-03-5|location=Saint-Boniface, Manitoba|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was skilled in many languages including French, English, [[Michif]], and Cree.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The church saw her as ideal to become a teacher but also a mediator between; the missionaries and the aboriginal people. Also between the aboriginal woman, the church, and the [[Hudson's Bay Company|Hudson Bay Company]].

After the death of her father in 1864, Louis became the head of the family therefor responsible for his mother and younger siblings including Sara Riel.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He and the rest of the children were forced to quit school to help with agriculture and sustaining the family home. Sara Riel was the only one who was allowed to stay in school and fulfill her mission as a nun.

== Religion ==
The Riel family was very dedicated to the education of their children. Their mother was especially dedicated to the church and instilled the will of God into her children. The family found themselves very close to [[Alexandre-Antonin Taché]] who was the head of the Catholic church in St. Boniface. It was through him that Sara Riel learned of the missionaries and Louis Riel was chosen to study for the priesthood. Louis Riel left school in 1865, abandoning all wishes to join the church. He did not return home from Montreal until after his father's death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Following in her loving brother's footsteps Sara Riel was accepted to the Grey Nuns as a novice in 1866.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=De ta Soeur, Sara Riel.|last=Jordan|first=Mary|publisher=Édition des Plaines|year=1980|isbn=0-920944-03-5|location=Saint-Boniface, Manitoba|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later in 1868, Sara Riel took her vows and joined the Catholic community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At this time, Red River had just 26 sisters serving as missionaries.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=C1PS3xjBK_oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Recollecting+:+Lives+of+Aboriginal+Woman+of+Canadian+North+West+and&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1pKeWvJTZAhWo34MKHd1ECckQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Recollecting%20:%20Lives%20of%20Aboriginal%20Woman%20of%20Canadian%20North%20West%20and&amp;f=false|title=Recollecting: Lives of Aboriginal Women of the Canadian Northwest and Borderlands|last=Carter|first=Sarah|last2=McCormack|first2=Patricia Alice|date=2011|publisher=Athabasca University Press|year=|isbn=9781897425824|location=|page=125|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of which came from Quebec, who helped provide a better education for the country born children and Métis.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

On the 22nd of June 1871, Sister Riel left for the mission of Ile-a-La-Crosse now in northern Saskatchewan. Le Métis (a local Red River newspaper) reported: “Sister Riel, Sister of Mr. Louis Riel, however, had been designated to accompany her (Sister Charlebois), she is believed the first missionary from the Métis nation of Red River, given to this Great Apostolic work, and one could not find a more dignified person. a kind heart, keen intelligence, and inexhaustible charity distinguished this new missionary, her departure is a sacrifice for her family and the entire population, but at the same time it is an honor and a blessing for us”.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== The Métis Resistance 1869-1870 ==
The first Métis resistance happened between 1869-1870. This happened following the establishment of the Canadian government and first signs of surveyors on the Métis land.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c5YiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=m%C3%A9tis+resistance&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikndLUguLZAhUFF6wKHW6wDzYQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=m%C3%A9tis%20resistance&amp;f=false|title=Métis: Race, Recognition, and the Struggle for Indigenous Peoplehood|last=Andersen|first=Chris|date=2014-04-21|publisher=UBC Press|year=|isbn=9780774827232|location=|page=113|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hudson Bay Company sold [[Rupert's Land|Rupert’s Land]] to the Canadian Government without thinking about the people who occupied it or had claims over it.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Louis Riel and the other Métis believed that the creation of the Canadian state was not only a political issue but also a religious and cultural one.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=hgJwXcKKK4oC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=louis+riel+%22red+river+rebellion%22&amp;ots=oNukA-RcAB&amp;sig=oYxr0TpPB6VY4Wi329JRmf2xyoQ#v=onepage&amp;q=louis%20riel%20%22red%20river%20rebellion%22&amp;f=false|title=Louis Riel and the Creation of Modern Canada: Mythic Discourse and the Postcolonial State|last=Reid|first=Jennifer|date=2008|publisher=UNM Press|year=|isbn=9780826344151|location=|page=189|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With determination to preserve their way of life the Métis people took arms. After stopping surveyors, the Métis of Red River formed a provisional government.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c5YiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=m%C3%A9tis+resistance&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikndLUguLZAhUFF6wKHW6wDzYQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=m%C3%A9tis%20resistance&amp;f=false|title=Métis: Race, Recognition, and the Struggle for Indigenous Peoplehood|last=Andersen|first=Chris|date=2014-04-21|publisher=UBC Press|year=|isbn=9780774827232|location=|page=114|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the head of the provisional government was Louis Riel.

During the conflict, the Métis took [[Fort Garry, Winnipeg|Fort Gary]] and executed [[Thomas Scott (Orangeman)|Thomas Scott]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This forced the Canadian government to acknowledge the people who lived on the land. This uprising created the province known as Manitoba. With Sara and Louis Riel's close relationship and tensions rising between the Métis and the government, the congregation had to take special precaution with Sara Riel.

By 1869 the congregation feared for Sister Riel’s safety. With the rebellion unfolding, she was moved back to St.Boniface. Sara Riel was not impressed by the choice to move her. When Sara learned that she would have to perform manual and domestic duties, she saw that as a demotion to all the hard work she had done. Sister Riel wrote in one of her letters: “The annual autumn changes took place today on the 20th. my mission to St.Norber is over. The order placed me in the day school. I must also mend and was the community linen-- a job that occupies me continuously without fatigues”&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=C1PS3xjBK_oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Recollecting+:+Lives+of+Aboriginal+Woman+of+Canadian+North+West+and&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1pKeWvJTZAhWo34MKHd1ECckQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Recollecting%20:%20Lives%20of%20Aboriginal%20Woman%20of%20Canadian%20North%20West%20and&amp;f=false|title=Recollecting: Lives of Aboriginal Women of the Canadian Northwest and Borderlands|last=Carter|first=Sarah|last2=McCormack|first2=Patricia Alice|date=2011|publisher=Athabasca University Press|year=|isbn=9781897425824|location=|page=127|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With all the stress and chaos that the rebellion brought at home, Sister Riel still wrote actively to her brother. In the many letters sent, Sara  Riel repeatedly told her brother to stay strong and fight for what they both believed in. In September 1868, she wrote: “Louis, chase away the sad and troubling thoughts to which our last meeting gave birth. Which time and the grace of God, the darkness of the present will disappear. Be confident! until then, we must do out duties. You as a fervent Christian and me as a sister of charity”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=C1PS3xjBK_oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Recollecting+:+Lives+of+Aboriginal+Woman+of+Canadian+North+West+and&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1pKeWvJTZAhWo34MKHd1ECckQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Recollecting%20:%20Lives%20of%20Aboriginal%20Woman%20of%20Canadian%20North%20West%20and&amp;f=false|title=Recollecting: Lives of Aboriginal Women of the Canadian Northwest and Borderlands|last=Carter|first=Sarah|last2=McCormack|first2=Patricia Alice|date=2011|publisher=Athabasca University Press|isbn=9781897425824|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Louis Riel was in exile to Saint-Joseph, Detroit after the first uprising, Sara Riel wrote several letters to Louis showing confidence, love and vital information that may have played a role in the future of the cause. She wrote; “truthfully I believe it would be an insult to God if I doubted for only a second the complete success of our cause  ... remember last winter when everything seemed over. It was God’s will that you should be overthrown, it overthrew in order to better your success”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=C1PS3xjBK_oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Recollecting+:+Lives+of+Aboriginal+Woman+of+Canadian+North+West+and&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1pKeWvJTZAhWo34MKHd1ECckQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Recollecting%20:%20Lives%20of%20Aboriginal%20Woman%20of%20Canadian%20North%20West%20and&amp;f=false|title=Recollecting: Lives of Aboriginal Women of the Canadian Northwest and Borderlands|last=Carter|first=Sarah|last2=McCormack|first2=Patricia Alice|date=2011|publisher=Athabasca University Press|year=|isbn=9781897425824|location=|page=128|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another letter she sent she described the heartache felt by the Métis following his departure. She wrote: &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; Louis let us bury our sorrows in the wounds of his (God) sacred heart...to love and pray, these are the arms with which we must fight to vanquish the conqueror&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=CLVawm9_f6QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Unsettled Pasts: Reconceiving the West Through Women's History|last=Carter|first=Sarah|date=2005|publisher=University of Calgary Press|year=|isbn=9781552381779|location=|page=18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the exile, Sister Riel and Mgr Taché knew of Louis Riel's whereabouts and even helped him with news and information of Canadian politics.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=De ta soeur, Sara Riel|last=Jordan|first=Mary|publisher=Éditions des Plaines|year=1980|isbn=0-920944-03-5|location=Saint-Boniface, Manitoba|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is about the same time that Sara Riel chose to exile herself. But like the letters to Louis Riel, they both had to wait until the time was right.This was a hard time for Sara Riel, she prayed for her brother's health and safety.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Following the resistance, the people of Red River elected Louis Riel to a seat in [[Parliament]] in 1873 but he was a wanted man in Canada.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The Canadian Government wanted him for the murder of Scott, which prevented him from taking his seat and delayed his return to Red River. The last Métis resistance occurred in 1885, one year after the death of Sara Riel.

== Life after the Resistance ==
Sara Riel was often mentioned in the writings and correspondence of the Gray Nuns.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; She was a very active, important and hardworking member of the clergy, who was often recognized for her actions.

In 1872 Sister Riel was taken ill and almost died one day after choir practice. After a miraculous recovery, she claimed to have been saved by God and her faith was solidified. She changed her name to that of a great saint: “Marguerite-Marie of Alacoque” after a vision from God.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=C1PS3xjBK_oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Recollecting+:+Lives+of+Aboriginal+Woman+of+Canadian+North+West+and&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1pKeWvJTZAhWo34MKHd1ECckQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Recollecting%20:%20Lives%20of%20Aboriginal%20Woman%20of%20Canadian%20North%20West%20and&amp;f=false|title=Recollecting: Lives of Aboriginal Women of the Canadian Northwest and Borderlands|last=Carter|first=Sarah|last2=McCormack|first2=Patricia Alice|date=2011|publisher=Athabasca University Press|year=|isbn=9781897425824|location=|page=116|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s her health began to decline. Sara Riel suffered from tuberculosis for many years. When her health became very serious she was given permission to return to Red River, to be with her family in her final days. Sister Riel refused the offer. She was determined that her mission was to Île-à-la-Cross and would stay until the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=De ta Soeur, Sara Riel.|last=Jordan|first=Mary|publisher=Éditions des Plaines|year=1980|isbn=0-920944-03-5|location=Saint-Boniface, Manitoba|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sara Riel died December 27, 1883 at the age of 35.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=De ta Soeur, Sara Riel|last=Jordan|first=Mary|publisher=Éditions des Plaines|year=1980|isbn=0-920944-03-5|location=Saint-Boniface, Manitoba|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served the Catholic Church as a Nun for just over 17years, either as a teacher, a translator or a missionary.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The chronicles from Île-à-la-Cross described her last moments as ones of suffering and difficulties.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; One of her final letters was addressed to her brother, Louis Riel.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She claimed her love for him, she reminded him to be strong and to remain dedicated to God in all his actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=De ta Soeur, Sara Riel|last=Jordan|first=Mary|publisher=Éditions des Plaines|year=1980|isbn=0-920944-03-5|location=Saint-Boniface, Manitoba|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 1885, the day after the [[Green Lake, Saskatchewan|Green Lake Post]] was looted during the [[North-West Rebellion]], the Grey Nuns of Île-à-la-Crosse were terrified that Louis Riel, who had accused them of letting his younger sister die in misery would seek revenge. They fled the village along with most of the personnel and dependents of the Hudson's Bay Company Post and the Roman Catholic Mission. The large group camped on a small wooded island north of [[Patuanak, Saskatchewan|Patuanak]] until the crisis was over and returned to Île-à-la-Crosse on May 29, 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peel.library.ualberta.ca/bibliography/1483/134.html?qid=peelbib|title=Peel 1483, p. 129|website=peel.library.ualberta.ca|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Today, Sara Riel is not talked about as much as her brother. The Riel family home still stands in Red River and has become a historical site in the province of Manitoba.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=De ta Soeur, Sara Riel|last=Jordan|first=Mary|publisher=Éditions des Plaines|year=1980|isbn=0-920944-03-5|location=Saint-Boniface, Manitoba|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is referred to as the birthplace of the Métis resistance.

Sara Riel is seen as an important figure in the history of the Métis woman, of Red River and in the Catholic Missionary. She was an active writer which left a larger paper trail allowing historians and scholars an insight into her life, family and the people at the time of the resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=C1PS3xjBK_oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Recollecting+:+Lives+of+Aboriginal+Woman+of+Canadian+North+West+and&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1pKeWvJTZAhWo34MKHd1ECckQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Recollecting%20:%20Lives%20of%20Aboriginal%20Woman%20of%20Canadian%20North%20West%20and&amp;f=false|title=Recollecting: Lives of Aboriginal Women of the Canadian Northwest and Borderlands|last=Carter|first=Sarah|last2=McCormack|first2=Patricia Alice|date=2011|publisher=Athabasca University Press|year=|isbn=9781897425824|location=|page=117|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in the 1970&lt;nowiki&gt;'s Sara was looked at in a more negative way, she was declared '' a pale representation of her brother''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; her letter left important information in Canadian History, allowing an alternate view into many aspects of life of the 1800s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7209">'''Shuah''' ({{lang-he-n|שׁוּחַ}}) is the name of one of four minor Biblical figures.  It is sometimes used as the name of a fifth.  Their names are different in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], but they were all transliterated as "Shuah" in the [[King James Version]].

==Genesis 25==

Shuah (Hebrew: שׁוּחַ, pronounced "Shuakh", "ditch; swimming; humiliation"&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibletools.org//index.cfm/fuseaction/Def.show/RTD/Hitchcock/ID/2321/Shuah.htm ''Hitchcock's Bible Dictionary'':] Shuah&lt;/ref&gt; or "sinks down"&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/hebrew/7743.htm Brown-Driver-Briggs]&lt;/ref&gt;) was the sixth son of [[Abraham]] (the [[patriarch]] of the [[Israelites]]) and [[Keturah]], whom Abraham had wed after the death of [[Sarah]].&lt;ref name=Gen25&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:1-6|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|1:32|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the youngest of Keturah's sons; the others were [[Zimran]], [[Jokshan]], [[Medan (son of Abraham)|Medan]], [[Midian (son of Abraham)|Midian]], and [[Ishbak]].&lt;ref name=Gen25/&gt;

Shuah in Greek is Σωυε, transliterated Soie.&lt;ref&gt;From the [[Septuagint]] and [[Brenton's English Translation of the Septuagint|Brenton]] [http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/physis/septuagint-genesis/25.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephus]] gave his name as Σοῦος (Sous in [[Antiquities of the Jews#Translations|Whiston]]).&lt;ref name=Josephus1151&gt;[[Josephus]], Flavius, ''Antiquities'', 1.15.1 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0145%3Abook%3D1%3Awhiston+chapter%3D15%3Awhiston+section%3D1 Greek] [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link2HCH0015 Whiston]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josephus]] writes of the brothers that "Abraham contrived to settle them in colonies; and they took possession of [[Troglodytis]],&lt;ref&gt;In this case the word is applied to the cave dwelling peoples of the Rift Valley&lt;/ref&gt; and the country of [[Arabia Felix]], as far as it reaches to the [[Red Sea]]."&lt;ref name=Josephus1151/&gt;  It is a traditional view among believers in the story that Abraham tried to keep his other sons apart from [[Isaac]] to avoid conflict. &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|1:27,28|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Genesis|9:1|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], Flavius, ''Antiquities'', 1.4.1-3&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=Existing references are Bible/Josephus, we need a reliable source making the speculation|date=July 2014}}   But unlike his brothers, Shuah seems to have turned northward and travelled into northern [[Mesopotamia]], in what is now the northern region of modern-day [[Syria]].  As evidenced by [[cuneiform]] texts, the land seems to have been named after him, being known as the land of ''Sûchu'' which lies to the south of ancient [[Hittites|Hittite]] capital of [[Carchemish]] on the [[Euphrates]] river.&lt;ref&gt;''Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary'', Review and Herald Publishing Association (Washington, D.C., USA), 1953, p.367&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible also records that [[Job (Bible)|Job]]'s friend [[Bildad]] was a ''Shuhite''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Job|2:11|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Job|8:1|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis 38==
Shuah or Shua (Hebrew: שׁוּעַ, pronounced "Shuaʿ", with an [[ayin]] glottal stop at the end, "opulence"&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/hebrew/7769.htm Brown-Driver-Briggs]&lt;/ref&gt; or "cry for help"&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/hebrew/7769.htm Strong's Concordance]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a certain Caananite, whose unnamed daughter marries [[Judah (biblical person)|Judah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|38:2,12|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was thereby also the grandfather of Er, [[Onan]], Shelah.

The Targum translates "Canaanite man" as "merchant", and Rashi refers to this.  In the Talmud, ''Pesachim'' 50a, there is a discussion explaining this translation.

In the King James Version, Genesis 38:2 reads "And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah ..." This is ambiguous as to who is named Shuah, the Canaanite or his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew says "''his'' name", and Genesis 38:12 refers to the death of Shuah's daughter.&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led some to say that Shuah was Judah's wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible Cyclopedia|volume=3|author=John Parker Lawson|year=1850|page=791|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=znNAAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=shuah%20%22wife%20of%20judah%22&amp;pg=PA791#v=onepage&amp;q=shuah%20%22wife%20of%20judah%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Illustrated History of the Holy Bible|author=John Kitto|year=1869|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9tI3AQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=shuah&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q=shuah&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuah in Greek is Σαυα, transliterated Sava.&lt;ref&gt;From the Septuagint and Brenton [http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/physis/septuagint-genesis/38.asp].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Septuagint is explicit that Sava is the daughter of the Canaanite man and the wife of Judah.

The reference to Judah's wife in Genesis 38:12 refers to her as the "daughter of Shuah", or "bat-Shuah" in Hebrew.  This has led some to take Bat-Shuah (and variants) as her actual name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Biblical Personality|author=Richard S. Chapin|publisher=Jason Aronson|year=1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9xIyUYMc7RsC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=bat-shua&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q=bat-shua&amp;f=false|page=48|isbn=9780765760333}}&lt;/ref&gt; A midrashic tradition says her name was Aliyath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]]}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=8AHZ-l0u4n8C&amp;lpg=RA1-PR17&amp;dq=sefer%20ha%20yashar&amp;pg=PA134#v=snippet&amp;q=aliyath&amp;f=false Chapter 45:4,29]&lt;/ref&gt; Bat-Shuah is also an alternative name for Bat-Sheva, wife of Judah's descendant, King David.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|3:5|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1 Chronicles 4==

Shuah or Shuhah (Hebrew: שׁוּחָה, pronounced "Shukhah") is a descendant of Judah.  No gender or father is named, just a brother Chelub and his descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|4:11|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gersonides|Ralbag]] in his commentary&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikraot Gedolot|מקראות גדולות דברי הימים א]]&lt;/ref&gt; says that Shuhah is the same as Hushah (חוּשָׁה) listed earlier in the genealogy.  Nave says Shuhah is "probably the same" as Hushah.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d4swAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=nave's%20topical%20index&amp;pg=PA584#v=onepage&amp;q=hushah&amp;f=false Nave's Topical Index]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuah in Greek is ᾿Ασχὰ, transliterated Ascha.&lt;ref&gt;From the Septuagint and Brenton [http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/septuagint/chapter.asp?book=13&amp;page=4].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Septuagint states that Chaleb is Ascha's father.

==1 Chronicles 7==

Shuah or Shua (Hebrew: שׁוּעָא, pronounced "Shuʿa", with an ayin glottal stop in the middle, "wealth"&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/hebrew/7774.htm Strong's Concordance]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a great-granddaughter of [[Asher]].  She was the daughter of Heber, who was a son of Beriah, a son of Asher.  Her brothers were Japhlet, Shomer, and Hotham.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|7:32|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuah in Greek is Σωλὰ, transliterated Sola.&lt;ref&gt;From the Septuagint and Brenton [http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/septuagint/chapter.asp?book=13&amp;page=7].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:27 Alfandari Street.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A plaque is affixed beside the doorway of a new apartment building at 27 Alfandari Street, [[Jerusalem]]. The original home that was razed for the construction of this building was the home of Rabbi Solomon Eliezer Alfandari in the original Ruchama neighborhood (founded 1921, now [[Mekor Baruch]]). The plaque reads: "Here lived until 1930 Rabbi Shlomo Eliezer Alfandari, a [[Kabbalist]] and one of the great [[Poskim]]".]]
'''Solomon Eliezer Alfandari''' ({{lang-he|שלמה אליעזר אלפנדרי}}) ({{abbr|c.|circa}} 1826 – 1930), also known as the '''Saba Kadisha''' ("Holy Grandfather"), was a distinguished [[rabbi]], [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]] and [[rosh yeshiva]] in his native home of [[Constantinople]], and later served as [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Damascus]], [[Syria Vilayet]], and [[Safed]], [[Beirut Vilayet]]. He was known for his stringent interpretation of [[halakha]] and his uncompromising dedication to [[Orthodox Judaism]].

==Early life==
The Saba Kadisha was born in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-controlled Constantinople around 1826 (some say as early as 1820&lt;ref name="Sofer"&gt;[http://www.torahcenter.com/bios/alfandri.htm Sofer, D. ''Rav Shlomo Eliezer Alfandari''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219233235/http://www.torahcenter.com/bios/alfandri.htm |date=2012-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) to a distinguished family of [[Talmid Chacham|Torah scholars]]. His father, Yaakov, was a [[Talmud]]ic scholar; his grandfather, Rabbi [[Ḥayyim ben Yaakov Alfandari]], authored ''Maggid MiReishit'', and his great-grandfather, Rabbi [[Jacob ben Ḥayyim Alfandari|Yaakov ben Ḥayyim Alfandari]], authored ''Mutzal MiEish''. His mother, Chana, also came from an illustrious family.

As a youth, Solomon Eliezer was noted for his sharp understanding of Torah subjects. Yet he refused to accept a rabbinical position or to wear the customary dress of the city's sages. He did agree to join the [[Vaad]] Haruchani (Spiritual Council) of Constantinople, and accepted the position of rosh yeshiva in a yeshiva which the city's Jews founded for him. In the latter post, he taught many outstanding scholars, including Rabbi [[Chaim Hezekiah Medini]], later known as the Sdei Chemed.&lt;ref name="Sofer"/&gt;

==Fighting the draft==
Rabbi Solomon Eliezer displayed his willingness to take a firm stand in a highly charged political situation which found him challenging the views of his entire community.

The issue at hand was the drafting of Jewish soldiers into the [[sultan]]'s army, a decree fraught with spiritual peril. Originally, the Jews who had fled the [[Spanish Inquisition]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] were exempted from the army by the sultan. In Rabbi Solomon Eliezer's day, however, a new sultan, [[Abdul Hamid II]], decreed that all non-[[Muslim]]s must enlist.

The city's rabbis tried to reverse the edict, without success. Eventually they decided to accept the decree rather than provoke the authorities. The Vaad Haruchani issued a directive urging the region's Jews to go ahead and enlist.

Rabbi Solomon Eliezer was the only one who protested this course of action. At the Vaad meeting, he declared, "Since serving in the Turkish army involves [[Shabbat]] desecration and the defiling of oneself with [[Kashrut|nonkosher]] food, enlisting in the army is considered a ''[[Chillul Hashem]]''. We must not yield to Sultan Abdul Hamid. If we are firm, [[Names of God in Judaism|Hashem]] will help us." After this declaration, he burst into tears.

One of the community's wealthy members had some influence in the sultan's court. Yet this Jew, too, backed the draft decree. One day, as this man visited the palace to oversee certain aspects of the decree, he fell unconscious and died.

The next day, a huge gathering assembled at the wealthy man's funeral. At that time, it was customary for Rabbi Solomon Eliezer to deliver the first eulogy at every funeral, and no one dared precede him. But today, Rabbi Solomon Eliezer stayed home. Community representatives came to plead with him to speak, or at least to let others speak without him, but he refused. The sons of the wealthy man came to offer him a large sum of money which he could use for [[tzedaka]], but still he refused. "Yesterday I visited your father and asked him not to collaborate with the sultan," the rabbi explained. "But he defied me. Therefore, I cannot honor him."

In the end, none of the city's rabbis eulogized the man.

Sultan Abdul Hamid was furious when he heard about Rabbi Solomon Eliezer's efforts to cancel the draft decree. He summoned the rabbi to the palace, intending to punish him for inciting the Jews against him. But when the sultan met the rabbi and heard his position, he was very impressed with him. He even granted him the title of [[Hakham Bashi]], with the power to issue edicts in the Jewish community.&lt;ref name="Sofer" /&gt;

In the end, the draft was not enforced due to internal conflicts in the royal court.

==Damascus==
In 1897, the Saba Kadisha decided to leave Constantinople to accept the position of Chief Rabbi of Damascus. Here he founded a yeshiva which produced dozens of students who served as rabbis and ''[[beth din|dayanim]]'' in Sephardic communities in the region.&lt;ref name="Sofer" /&gt;

==Safed==
In 1904, at almost 90 years of age, he immigrated to Palestine. At first he lived for several years in the city of [[Haifa]], but then accepted the invitation of the Torah leaders of [[Safed]] to serve as their Chief Rabbi, a position he held until 1918.

The story is told that when Rabbi Solomon Eliezer went outside to [[Kiddush Levana|bless the new moon]] with his congregants at the beginning of the month of [[Nisan]] 5674 (April 1914), he looked up after completing the blessings, clapped his hands and cried loudly. He explained, "I see that a large-scale war will soon break out."&lt;ref name="Sofer" /&gt; Four months later, World War I began.

Rabbi Solomon Eliezer was able to relieve the water and food shortages faced by the Jews of Safed during World War I as a result of another encounter with a Turkish official. This time, a Turkish [[pasha]] came to the city riding a white horse and dressed in a flashy uniform, with a retinue of Turkish soldiers. When the Saba Kadisha came out to greet him, the pasha was impressed by the rabbi's distinguished appearance, and asked him for a blessing.

"Only the humble can receive blessings," the rabbi replied. "I will bless you after you come down from your horse."

The pasha complied, and the rabbi blessed him: "May God help you in your efforts to see to the needs of the oppressed Jewish nation." As a result of that encounter, the pasha did arrange for food and water to be supplied to Safed's Jewish residents."&lt;ref name="Sofer" /&gt;

In 1918, rabbi [[Yisroel Ber Odesser]], a [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslover]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasid]], became a personal attendant to rabbi Solomon Eliezer, who was living in [[Tiberias]] at the time. After seeing Odesser recite ''[[Tikkun Chatzot]]'' one night, however, the Saba Kadisha refused to let him attend him anymore, and instead treated him as a young colleague.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanach.org/intro/highlights-rabbi-yisroel-dovber-odesser.html ''Highlights in the Life of Rabbi Yisroel DovBer Odesser''. nanach.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jerusalem==
[[File:Alfandari Street Sign.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Jerusalem street on which Alfandari lived has been named after him.]]
In his final years, Alfandari suffered many ailments, for which he sought medical treatment in [[Jerusalem]]. Although he tried to travel incognito, many Torah leaders desired to meet him when they found out he was in their city. One of these ''gedolim'' was Rabbi [[Ezra Attiya]], who later became rosh yeshiva of [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]]. The Saba Kadisha held Rabbi Attiya in high esteem, and would always stand up for him when he visited.

In 1925, Alfandari developed a serious illness while in [[Tiberias]]. He refused to be treated in the local hospital, where the rules of ''[[tzniut]]'' (modesty) were not meticulously observed, and was taken to [[Shaare Zedek Medical Center|Shaarei Tzedek Hospital]] in Jerusalem instead. After he recovered, Jerusalem's sages begged him to stay in their city. He rented an apartment in the Ruchama neighborhood (today [[Mekor Baruch]]).

Here he hosted meetings with many prominent Torah scholars who came to consult with him and speak with him in learning. These included: Rabbi [[Tzvi Pesach Frank]], Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem; Rabbi [[Velvel Mintzberg]], leader of the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] community in the Old Yishuv;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/parsha/gleaned/archives/noach.htm Grossbard, Rabbi Simcha Leib. ''Gleaned from the Sfas Emes: Parshas Noach''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Avraham Weinberg of [[Slonim (Hasidic dynasty)|Slonim]], author of ''Birkas Avraham''; and Rabbi [[Yitzchak Abuchatzeira]], brother of the [[Baba Sali]] and a Torah sage in his own right.&lt;ref name="Sofer" /&gt; Shortly before the Saba Kadisha's death, the [[Munkacs (Hasidic dynasty)|Munkatcher]] [[Rebbe]], Rabbi [[Chaim Elazar Spira]], of [[Hungary]] made a special trip to meet him. Theirs was considered an historic meeting between two worlds, the Sephardi genius of the Middle East and the Hasidic tradition of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Rabbi Moshe (2009). ''Journey to Jerusalem: The historic meeting of the Minchas Eluzar of Munkacs zt"l to the Saba Kadisha zt"l''. Mesorah Publications. {{ISBN|1-4226-0887-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfandari contracted [[pneumonia]] in May 1930 and was treated by Dr. [[Moshe Wallach]] of Shaarei Tzedek Hospital. His disease worsened, however, and he died on 20 May 1930 (22 [[Iyar]] 5690). His funeral was attended by thousands, as his students carried his casket on foot from his home all the way to the [[Mount of Olives]]. He was nearly 110 years old.

The street on which Alfandari lived in Jerusalem was named in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yqXXD_74yAEC&amp;pg=PA19 Eisenberg, Ronald L. (2006). ''The Streets of Jerusalem: Who, What, Why''. Devora Publishing], {{ISBN|1-932687-54-8}}, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

He forbade the shaving of beards, even using scissors or [[Chemical depilatory|depilatory cream]]. He even refused to speak with a ''[[Talmid Chacham|talmid chacham]]'' who did not have a beard, even if the discussion concerned the [[Talmud]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koshershaver.info/pdf/Letter_to_the_Editor.pdf ''A Letter to the Editor From a Resident of the Flatbush Sephardic Community''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his move from Syria to Palestine, the Saba Kadisha stopped off in [[Beirut]], where many questions were addressed to him regarding ''[[shmita]]'' (the laws of the Sabbatical year). His responses indicate that he strongly opposed the ''heter mechira'' which Israel's Chief Rabbinate had adopted to spare its farmers from loss.&lt;ref name="Sofer" /&gt;
Rabbi Solomon Eliezer was a strong opponent of the  Zionist Nationalist Council (Vaad Haleumi), which, in British Mandate Palestine, automatically enlisted all Jews, unless they opted out. Rav Alfandari signed legal rulings obligating every Jew to opt out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/news/currentarticle.cfm?id=215 True Torah Jews Against Zionism: "Rabbi curses Palestinians, Anti-Zionist Jews respond", August 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, Gibson worked on light pen technology for use with Apple and Atari systems. In 1985, he founded Gibson Research Corporation,  best known for its [[SpinRite]] software.

==Personal==
Gibson started working on computers as a teenager, and got his first computing job with [[Stanford University]]'s [[artificial intelligence]] lab when he was 15 years old.&lt;ref name=MillarGuardian/&gt;  He studied electrical engineering and computer science at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=GibsonResume/&gt;

==Career==
Gibson was hired as a programmer for [[California Pacific Computer Company]] in 1980, where he worked on copy protection for the company's products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knudsen |first=Richard |title=Exec California Pacific: Innovative Marketing Budges |url=http://www.softalkapple.com/sites/default/files/Softalk_V1.05_draft.pdf |work=Softalk Magazine |date=January 1981 |volume=1 |number=5 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson founded Gibson Laboratories in [[Laguna Hills, California]] in 1981; Gibson Labs developed a [[light pen]] for the Apple II, Atari, and other platforms and went out of business in 1983.&lt;ref name=GibsonResume&gt;{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Gibson |url=https://www.grc.com/resume.htm |title=Steve's Resumé |work=GRC.com |accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ei4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Hardware: Light Pen Technology looks to the Micro |last=Mace |first=Scott |date=December 26, 1983 |page=61 |work=InfoWorld |accessdate=January 27, 2015 |quote=The Gibson Light Pen has been developed for Atari home computers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=InfoWorld Aug 9, 1982 / P13-17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NDAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=david+needle+lps+II&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EzqKX99XPh&amp;sig=nHRHeNsDHThMZHFc-yAX-u-PMWA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9wLzGgJHLAhXLVz4KHar4BX8Q6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20needle%20lps%20II&amp;f=false|website=books.google.com|publisher=Popular Computing Inc|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1985 Gibson founded Gibson Research Corporation (GRC) - a computer [[software development]] firm.&lt;ref name=GibsonResume/&gt;

From 1986 to 1993 Gibson wrote the "Tech Talk" column for ''[[InfoWorld]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ToEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102 |title=SpinRite upgrade |date=October 11, 1993 |work=InfoWorld  |quote=...Steve Gibson, whose Tech Talk column has run in InfoWorld for close to eight years...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Gibson created one of the first [[adware]] removal programs, which he called OptOut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lavasoft |url=http://www.lavasoft.com/mylavasoft/securitycenter/articles/spyware-history |title=The History of Spyware |work=Lavasoft.com |accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Gibson predicted that Microsoft's implementation of the [[raw socket|SOCK_RAW]] protocol in the initial release of [[Windows XP]] would lead to widespread chaos by making it easier for Windows XP users to create [[denial of service]] (DoS) attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Deborah |last=Radcliff |work=Computerworld |date=October 22, 2001 |url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2585406/operating-systems/windows-xp--is-it-safe-.html |title=Windows XP: Is it safe?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite media |type=video |url=http://www.vpwsys.net/download/grc_low.wma | title=Raw Sockets Debate: Steve Gibson with Tom C.

In 2005 Gibson launched a weekly [[podcast]] called "[[Security Now]]" with [[Leo Laporte]] on [[TWiT.tv]], with its archives hosted on GRC's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.grc.com/sn/past/2005.htm |title=Security Now!

In 2006 Gibson raised the possibility that the [[Windows Metafile vulnerability]] bug was actually a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] intentionally engineered into the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-022.htm |title=Security Now!

'''Hasan Predojević''' ({{circa}} 1530 – 22 June 1593), also known as '''Telli Hasan Pasha''' ({{lang-tr|Telli Hasan Paşa}}){{Cref2|a}}, was the fifth [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[beylerbey]] ([[Wāli|vali]]) of [[Bosnia Eyalet|Bosnia]] and a notable [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] [[Bosnian people|Bosnian]] military commander, who led an invasion of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia]] during the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]].

At first, Telli Hasan Pasha's troops met little resistance, allowing them to capture numerous Uskoci settlements, where they enslaved or slaughtered the entire population and burned the settlements. His forces soon besieged and captured Senj and exterminated the Uskoci population. For his successes, the Pasha was awarded the title of "[[Vizier]]" by the Sultan. However, the following year, Telli Hasan Pasha decided to advance further into Croatia.

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 1261''', adopted unanimously on 25 August 1999, in the first resolution to address the topic, the Council condemned the targeting of children in [[war|armed conflict]] including the recruitment and use of [[Military use of children|child soldiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Security Council strongly condemns targeting of children in situations of armed conflict, including their recruitment and use as soldiers|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1999/19990825.sc6716.html|publisher=United Nation|date=25 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Security Council was informed prior to the adoption of the resolution that 300,000 children from the age of seven or eight were serving as soldiers, [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] or supporting roles in armed conflicts in more than 30 countries around the world.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|title=UN move to protect children from war|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/430574.stm|agency=[[BBC News]]|date=26 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also told that wars within the past decade, armed conflicts had killed 2 million children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN passes resolution on child soldiers|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/1999/0826/un.html|agency=[[RTÉ]]|date=26 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution==
===Observations===
The preamble of the resolution noted recent efforts to bring to an end the use of child soldiers in violation of [[international law]], including the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999|Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] and the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] which prohibits forced [[conscription]] of children under the age of fifteen in armed forces or the participation in [[war crime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Happold|first=Matthew|title=Child soldiers in international law|year=2005|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-6586-6|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acts===
The Security Council expressed concern at the effect of armed conflict on children and the long-term effects on peace, security and development. It strongly condemned the targeting of children in conflict via murder, [[mutilation]], [[sexual violence]], [[child abduction|abduction]], [[forced migration|displacement]] or use in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singer|first=Peter W.|title=Talk Is Cheap: Getting Serious About Preventing Child Soldiers|journal=Cornell International Law Journal|year=2004|pages=561–586|url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/singer/20041201.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; All concerned parties were called upon to comply with their obligations under international law, in particular the [[Geneva Conventions]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and violators and bring violators to justice. The parties were also urged to ensure the protection of children (particularly with respect to gender-based violence) and to take their welfare and rights seriously during peace negotiations and additionally to facilitate the delivery of [[humanitarian aid]] to children.

The Council supported the efforts of the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] and [[Special Representative of the Secretary-General]] for Children and Armed Conflict. It underlined the importance of the safety, security and [[freedom of movement]] for United Nations and humanitarian personnel and urged all countries and the United Nations system to ensure an end to the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict through political efforts and the [[demilitarisation]], [[demobilisation]], rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vandewiele|first=Tiny|title=Optional protocol: the involvement of children in armed conflicts, Volume 51|year=2006|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-90-04-14730-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council recalled the provisions of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1209|Resolution 1209]] (1998) concerning the effects of the proliferation of arms on vulnerable groups, particularly children and in this regard reminded states to restrict arms transfers that would provoke or prolong conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ensalaco|first=Mark|title=Children's human rights: progress and challenges for children worldwide|year=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-2988-5|page=125|author2=Majka, Linda C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The resolution reaffirmed the Security Council's readiness when dealing with situation of children in armed conflict to:

:(a) ensure the provision of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population and taking into account the needs of children;
:(b) support the protection and [[human migration|resettlement]] of displaced children through the UNHCR and others;
:(c) consider the impact on children when adopting measures under Article 41 of the [[United Nations Charter]] concerning sanctions;
:(d) consider appropriate responses when buildings or sites used by children were targeted in armed conflict.

Finally, the Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] was asked to ensure that United Nations personnel had appropriate training on the rights and welfare of children and to report to the Council by 31 July 2000 on the implementation of the current resolution.

'''Vatslav Vatslavovich Vorovsky''' (&lt;small&gt;Russian:&lt;/small&gt; Ва́цлав Ва́цлавович Воро́вский; &lt;small&gt;Polish:&lt;/small&gt; Wacław Worowski) (1871 – 1923) was a [[Marxist]] revolutionary, literary critic, and [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russian]] [[diplomat]]. One of the first Soviet diplomats, Vorovsky is best remembered as the victim of a May 1923 political [[assassination]] in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], where he was the official representative of the Soviet government to the [[Conference of Lausanne]].

==Biography==

===Early years===

Vatslav Vorovsky was born October 27, 1871 (n.s.) in Moscow, the son of an ethnic [[Poles|Polish]] [[engineer]].&lt;ref name="L&amp;D"&gt;Branko Lazitch with Milorad M. Drachkovitch, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition.'' Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pp. 498-499.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the completion of [[secondary school]], Vorovsky enrolled at the [[University of Moscow]], where he was exposed to the ideas of political radicalism.&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt;

===Political career===

Vorovsky became active in the socialist movement in 1895.&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt; He was arrested by the [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] [[Okhrana|secret police]] shortly thereafter and sentenced to three years' exile in the city of [[Orlov, Russia|Orlov]].&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt; Upon his release, Vorovsky adopted a new underground [[pseudonym]], "P. Orlovsky," as a tribute to this experience.&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt; During the course of his underground career, Vorovsky also used the pseudonyms "Y. Adamovich," "M. Schwarz," "Josephine," and "Felix Alexandrovich."&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt;

Vorovsky emigrated to Europe in 1902, spending time in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt; In 1903 he affiliated himself with the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labor Party]], becoming an editor of the official organ of the party, ''Vperyod'' (Forward), in 1905.&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt;

During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], Vorovsky returned to Russia, working actively as a revolutionary in [[St. Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt; Following the defeat of the 1905 uprising he moved to [[Odessa]] in the [[Ukraine]], where he was a leading underground Bolshevik from 1907 to 1912.&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt;

In 1912, Vorovsky was arrested again, this time to be deported to Europe.&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt;

Vorovsky returned to Russia in 1915, landing in Petrograd — the new name of St. Petersburg — but he was soon sent to [[Stockholm]] by a business firm.&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt;

He was the first director of [[Gosizdat]], the State Publishing House, from its foundation in 1919 until 1921.&lt;ref name=GSUE&gt;{{cite web|title=Gosizdat|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Gosizdat|website=The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition (1970-1971)|publisher=The Gale group|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomatic career===

Following the victory of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in November 1917, Vorovsky was named the Soviet government's diplomatic representative to [[Scandinavia]], remaining based in Stockholm.&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt; In Stockholm, Vorovsky was the point of contact between the new Bolshevik government and representatives of the government of Germany, being introduced by [[Alexander Parvus]] to such luminaries of the [[German Social-Democratic Party]] as [[Philipp Scheidemann]] during November and December 1917.&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia: The Bolshevik Revolution, 1917-1923: Volume 3.'' London: Macmillan, 1953; pg. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1918, Sweden, responding to pressure on the part of the Allied powers who were intent upon imposing an unbreakable blockade, withdrew official recognition of Vorovsky as the representative of Soviet Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Fischer, ''The Soviets in World Affairs: A History of the Relations between the Soviet Union and the Rest of the World, 1917-1929.'' Second Edition. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1951; vol. 1, pg. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; This action on the part of the Swedish government forced Vorovsky's return to Russia the following month.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''The Bolshevik Revolution,'' vol. 3, pg. 114, fn. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This action taken against Vorovsky followed the precedent followed by Great Britain in expelling [[Maxim Litvinov]] in September 1918 and that of Germany in expelling [[Adolph Joffe]] in November of that same year.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''The Bolshevik Revolution,'' vol. 3, pp. 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1919, Vorovsky served as a member of the Soviet delegation to the [[Founding Congress of the Comintern|Founding Congress]] of the [[Communist International]].&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt; He was named the representative of the Russian Communist Party to the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International|Executive Committee of the Comintern]].&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt; He also served as one of the secretaries of the organization, along with [[Angelica Balabanoff|Angelica Balabanova]].&lt;ref name="Carr121"&gt;Carr, ''The Bolshevik Revolution,'' vol. 3, pg. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grigory Zinoviev|Grigorii Zinoviev]] was tapped as president of the organization.&lt;ref name="Carr121" /&gt;

In July 1920, Vorovsky resumed work as a Soviet diplomat, participating in diplomatic negotiations with [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt;

From 1921 to 1923, Vorovsky was the Soviet representative to Italy.&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt; In that capacity he was involved in attempts at negotiation of a trade agreement between the two countries, with a preliminary pact signed in December 1921.&lt;ref name="Fink"&gt;Carole Fink, ''The Genoa Conference: European Diplomacy, 1921-1922.'' Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1984; pg. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; This success proved short-lived, however, as negotiations to extend the six-month treaty failed in May 1922.&lt;ref name="Fink" /&gt;

Vorovsky was a member of the Soviet delegation to the 1922 [[Genoa Conference (1922)|Genoa Conference]], a group headed by Soviet Foreign Minister [[Georgy Chicherin|Georgii Chicherin]].

===Death and legacy===

Vorovsky's final diplomatic mission came in the spring of 1923, when he served as Soviet representative to the [[Conference of Lausanne|Lausanne conference]] of 1923.&lt;ref name="L&amp;D " /&gt; Accompanied by two diplomatic attachés, Vorovsky arrived in Lausanne from Rome on April 27, hoping to force the conference's official participants to recognize Soviet interests in the Turkish [[Black Sea|Black Sea Straits]].&lt;ref name="Fisher409"&gt;Fischer, ''The Soviets in World Affairs,'' vol. 1, pg. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, Vorovsky dispatched his final report to Moscow, noting that three days earlier a group of right wing youths had appeared at his hotel and sought a meeting. Vorovsky wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I refused to receive them, and Comrade Ahrens, who went out to them to find out what it was all about, disposed of them at once, telling them that they should put such matters before their Government. Now they are going about the town declaring that they will compel us to leave Switzerland by force, and so on.

"As to whether the police are taking any measures for our safety, we have no idea. At any rate, it is not apparent on the surface. It is only too evident that behind these hooligan boys there is some conscious directing hand — possibly foreign. The Swiss Government, well aware of what is going on — for the papers are full of it — must bear responsibility for our safety. The behaviour of the Swiss Government is a shameful violation of the guarantees given at the beginning of the conference, and any attack on us in this particularly well-organised country is only possible with the knowledge and permission of the authorities. On them is the responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;"The Murder of Vorovsky," first published in ''Izvestiia,'' (Moscow) May 15, 1923; reprinted in ''Russian Information and Review'' (London), vol. 2, no. 35 (June 9, 1923), pg. 547.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the evening of May 10, 1923, Vorovsky was seated at a dining table in the restaurant of his hotel with his colleagues when the group was approached by an individual they did not know. The unknown figure, a Russian [[White émigré]] named [[Maurice Conradi]], pulled a gun and shot Vorovsky to death, wounding his two companions, Ahrens and Divilkovsky, in the attack.&lt;ref name="Fisher409" /&gt; Conradi was defended by the advocate [[Théodore Aubert]] and later acquitted by the Swiss court in the epilogue of what would be known as the [[Maurice Conradi#Murder of Vorovsky|Conradi affair]]. It was later alleged that the murder was actually ordered by Stalin. &lt;ref name="vaksberg"&gt;Vaksberg, ''Toxic Politics:  The Secret History of the Kremlin's Poison Laboratory'' pp.  23,24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vatslav Vorovsky was 51 years old at the time of his death.

It was while at Yangzheng Primary School that he took his first step into his musical career. His teacher, Ou Jianfu, first noticed Xian Xinghai's musical talent, and he was enrolled into the school's military band. Xian received training in both musical instruments as well as music.{{clarify|date=June 2012}} He was later brought to Guangzhou for further education by his then school principal, Lin Yaoxiang, along with 19 other students. Xian started learning the [[clarinet]] in 1918 at the [[YMCA]] charity school attached to the [[Lingnan University (Guangzhou)|Lingnan University]] in [[Guangzhou]] (Canton). 

In 1924 he studied in [[Saint Andrew's School, Singapore|Saint Andrew's School]] of Singapore.&lt;ref name="sg" /&gt; In 1926 he joined the National Music Institute at [[Peking University]] to study music and in 1928 he entered National [[Shanghai Conservatory of Music]] to study [[violin]] and [[piano]]. The same year he published his well-known essay ''The Universal Music''. In 1929 he went to [[Paris]] (where he met [[Ma Sicong]] who introduced him to many artists there) and was disliked by his teacher first because he didn't know how to play piano but one night he got home and was mad and composed a song which the teacher heard. The teacher came inside and was fascinated with his work and asked him to bring his piece of work to the university where the composers competed their work and he won and he was accepted to that music school. In 1934 he was the first Chinese student admitted to the [[Paris Conservatory]] to study senior composition&lt;ref name="CC" /&gt; with [[Paul Dukas]].&lt;ref name="DGC" /&gt; And before this, he had studied with [[Vincent D'Indy]]. During this period he composed ''Wind'', ''Song of a Wanderer'', ''Violin Sonata in D Minor'', and other works.

==Musical career==
Xian returned to [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|China]] in 1935 to the [[Manchukuo|Japanese occupation of the northeastern part of the country]] (known then as [[Manchuria]]).&lt;ref name="DGC" /&gt; Using his music as a weapon to protest the occupation, he took part in patriotic activities.&lt;ref name="DGC" /&gt; During the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)]], he wrote vocal works that encouraged the people to fight the Japanese invaders, including ''Saving the Nation'', ''Non-Resistance the Only Fear'', ''Song of Guerrillas'', ''The Roads Are Opened by Us'', ''The Vast Siberia'', ''Children of the Motherland'', ''Go to the Homefront of the Enemy'', and ''On the Taihang Mountains'', among others.&lt;!--need Chinese characters for these song titles--&gt; He worked for film studios before going to the Communist headquarters in [[Yan'an]], where he became dean of the Music Department at [[Lu Xun]] Institute of Arts in 1938. It is at this time that he composed the famous ''[[Yellow River Cantata]]'' and the ''Production Cantata''.

[[File:冼星海墓.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Tomb of Xian Xinghai]]
In 1940 Xian went to the [[Soviet Union]] to compose the score of the documentary film ''Yan'an and the Eighth Route Army''.&lt;ref name="CC" /&gt; Before departure [[Mao Zedong]] invited him to dinner. In 1941 the German invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] disrupted his work and he attempted to return to [[China]] by way of [[Xinjiang]] but the local anti-communist warlord, [[Sheng Shicai]], blocked the way and he got stranded in [[Alma Ata]], [[Kazakhstan]]. It was here that he composed the symphonies ''Liberation of the Nation'' and ''Sacred War'', and the suites ''Red All Over the River'' and ''Chinese Rhapsody'' for winds and strings. He developed pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] due to overwork and [[malnutrition]]. After the war, Xian went back to [[Moscow]] for medical treatment but died of pulmonary disease on October 30, 1945&lt;ref name="CC" /&gt; at the age of 40.

==Legacy==
Xian composed over 300 works, published 35 papers, including ''Nie Er—the Creator of New Chinese Music'' and ''On the National Styles of Chinese Music''. His influence in Chinese music won him the title '''People's Composer'''.

During the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976), when all the Western and some Chinese art was forbidden, the pianist [[Yin Chengzong]] arranged the ''[[Yellow River Cantata]]'' into a concerto for piano and orchestra, by the name of ''[[Yellow River Piano Concerto]]'' (1969).

After [[China]] opened its doors to the world in late 1970s, Yin planned the performance of the piano concerto. There was a debate whether some politically incorrect anthems like "[[The East Is Red (song)|The East Is Red]]", which Yin interpolated into the concerto, should be removed. It was decided that the work itself was a cultural legacy of the time when it was created, the melodies reminding listeners of that period and creating a unique sense of history. Hence, the work remained intact as it was originally arranged.

Beginning in the 1970s, the ''Yellow River Concerto'' has been heard in the West, often performed by [[Yin Chengzong]] himself, and in 1988 the Italian pianist Riccardo Caramella became the first Western pianist who performed it in China with a Chinese orchestra, the [[Beijing Radio Symphony Orchestra]].

The epic film ''[[The Star and The Sea]]'' (2009)  created by directors Qiankuan Li and Guiyun Xiao (a husband and wife team) is about  the hard  childhood and suffering of Xian in that period of his life and the efforts of his mother to help him developing his musical talents.

==Biography==
Yehuda Leib Fishman (later Maimon) was born  in [[Mărculești]], [[Bessarabia]] (then part of the [[Russian Empire]], now in [[Moldova]]), Maimon studied in a number of [[yeshivot]] and received rabbinic ordination from Rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Epstein]], the author of the [[Aruch HaShulchan]].  He was one of the founders of the [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi movement]] in 1902. By this time Maimon had moved to the [[Russian Empire]], where he was arrested several times for [[Zionism|Zionist]] activity. He was a delegate to the ninth [[Zionist Congress]] in 1909, and attended every one until Israeli independence in 1948.&lt;ref name=PA/&gt;

In 1913, Maimon [[aliyah|immigrated]] to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]), but was expelled during [[World War I]]. He moved to the [[United States]], where he organised the Mizrachi movement. 

His sister, [[Ada Maimon|Ada]] also served as a member of the Knesset for [[Mapai]]. One of his great grand-daughters is the model [[Nina Brosh]].

==Political career==
After returning to [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] (now under British control) in 1919, Maimon became leader of [[Mizrachi (political party)|Mizrachi]] in the country and together with [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] he helped establish the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbinate]]. He was elected to the board of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]] in 1935.&lt;ref name=PA&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=503 Yehuda Leib Maimon: Public Activities] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, he founded [[Mossad Harav Kook]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mosadharavkook.com/store/about.php About] Mossad HaRav Kook&lt;/ref&gt; a religious research foundation and notable publishing house named in honor of Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]].

In 1946, he was imprisoned by the British in [[Latrun]] during [[Operation Agatha]]. The British detained him on the Jewish Sabbath, and he objected to riding in a vehicle on the Sabbath, and offered instead to walk to a nearby police station. The British refused his offer and forced him into a waiting car.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Bruce: ''Anonymous Soldiers'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Maimon helped draft [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israel's declaration of independence]], and was one of the people to sign it. He was appointed [[Ministry of Religious Services|Minister of Religions]], and also as Minister of War Victims in the [[Provisional government of Israel|provisional government]] set up immediately after independence. He was elected to the [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|first Knesset]] in 1949 as a member of the [[United Religious Front]] (an alliance of [[Agudat Yisrael]], [[Poalei Agudat Yisrael]], Mizrachi and [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]) and retained his ministerial role in the [[First government of Israel|first]] and [[Second government of Israel|second governments]]. He was the driving force behind a [[Semikhah#Attempt by Rabbi Yehudah Leib Maimon.2C 1949|failed effort]] to reestablish the Sanhedrin. He lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1951|1951 elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=503 Yehuda Leib Maimon: Knesset Activities] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;
==Awards and recognition==
