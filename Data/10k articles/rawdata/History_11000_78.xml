The year '''1937''' saw a number of significant events in '''[[radio broadcasting]]''' history.

==Events==
*1 February – First broadcast of the [[Sveriges Radio|Swedish radio]] programme ''Dagens dikt'' ("Poem of the day"), still on the air six days a week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2031&amp;artikel=459027 Sveriges Radio - Dagens dikt: historik ''(in Swedish)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

*4 July – Following the alteration of frequencies at the [[BBC]]'s [[Washford transmitting station|Washford transmitter]] to enable it to radiate separate regional services for Wales and the West of England, a new [[BBC_Regional_Programme|Welsh Regional Programme]] begins, broadcast from Washford on 1050 kHz and Penmon on 804 kHz.

Feeling against [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], and especially against [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], was running strongly; the [[Exclusion Bill]] had been passed by the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]], and the popularity of [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth]], was very great.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

To prevent this bill from passing into law, Charles had dissolved parliament in July 1679, and in the following October had [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogue]]d its successor, which became known as the [[Exclusion Bill Parliament]], without allowing it to meet.  He was then deluged with petitions urging him to call it together, and this agitation was opposed by Sir [[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|George Jeffreys]] and [[Francis Wythens]], who presented addresses expressing ''abhorrence'' of the ''Petitioners,'' and thus initiated the movement of the abhorrers, who supported the action of the king. "The frolic went all over [[England]]," says [[Roger North (17th century)|Roger North]]; and the addresses of the Abhorrers which reached the king from all parts of the country formed a counterblast to those of the [[Petitioner]]s. It is said that the terms [[British Whig Party|Whig]] and [[British Tory Party|Tory]] were first applied to English political parties in consequence of this dispute.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Alexander Nadson''' ({{lang-be|Аляксандар Надсан}}, '''Aliaksandar Nadsan''', 8 August 1926 – 15 April 2015) was the [[Apostolic visitor|Apostolic Visitor]] for [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church|Belarusian Greek-Catholic]] faithful abroad and a notable [[Belarus]]ian émigré social and religious leader.

Born Aliaksandar Bochka ({{lang-be|Аляксандар Бочка}}) in the village [[Haradzeya|Haradzieja]] near [[Niasvizh|Niasviž]], he studied at the Niasvizh seminary. In 1944 he emigrated from Belarus, and in 1945 was a soldier in the [[2nd Polish Corps]] fighting in northern Italy, where he was wounded. In 1946 he moved to [[Great Britain]] where he studied at the [[University of London]]. Nadson was one of the founders of the [[Association of Belarusians in Great Britain]] and its chairman in 1951–1953. He was editor of the periodicals ''Biełarus na čužynie'' and ''Na šlachu'', and took part in the activities of the Belarusian Christian academic society ''Ruń'' and the ''Belarusian People's Independent Christian Movement''.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

From fall 1953 he studied at the [[Greek Pontifical College#Collegio Pontifico Greco|Pontifical Greek College]] in [[Rome]]. He was ordained priest on 23 November 1958. In July 1959 Fr Nadson returned to [[London]], where he resumed his activities in organizations of the Belarusian diaspora.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

From 1971 Fr Nadson was the director of the [[Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library and Museum]] in London, the largest Belarusian library abroad. From 1981 he was head of the Belarusian Catholic mission in Great Britain, and from 1986, Apostolic Visitor for all Belarusian [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church|Greek-Catholic]] faithful abroad.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

He was the author of several books on the history of Belarus and the head of a [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] charity fund. Nadson died at 88 on 14 April 2015.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;[http://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=147863 Памёр духоўны лідар беларускай эміграцыі, айцец Аляксандр Надсан], Nasha Niva 16.04.2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alternatiba''' ({{lang-en|Alternative}}) is a [[Basque people|Basque]] [[socialist]] [[political party]]. Founded in 2009, Alternatiba was born as a critical tendency within [[United Left (Spain)|Izquierda Unida]] (IU) in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] opposing a participation in the Basque government along with the [[Basque Nationalist Party|PNV]] and [[Eusko Alkartasuna]]. In 2009 this tendency broke away from IU and formed an independent party.

'''Andra Gavrilović''' ({{lang-sr|Андра Гавриловић}}; [[Svilajnac]], [[Principality of Serbia]] 11 July 1864 — [[Belgrade]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] 24 February 1929) was Serbian historian, historian of literature, writer and diplomat.

Gavrilović disagreed with opinion of [[Jovan Tomić]] that figure of [[Djemo the Mountaineer]] was based on Jegen Osman Pasha.

The '''Battle of Luchana''' (''Lutxana'' in [[Basque language|Basque]]) occurred at [[Bilbao]] and its vicinities during the night of December 23, 1836 and went on until December 24, 1836.  The [[Carlists]] were besieging Bilbao and controlled the water and land routes towards the city.  The battle of Luchana took place in the district belonging to the parish of [[Deusto]] and the municipality of [[Erandio]], on the banks of the [[Asua|Asúa River]], which empties into the [[Nervión]] at the spot known as Luchana.  The Carlists were defeated and the siege of Bilbao was lifted.

'''Bertrand Gille''' (March 29, 1920, [[Paris]] &amp;ndash; November 30, 1980) was a [[France|French]] archivist and [[history of technology|historian of technology]].

Although best known for his work on technology, Gille also wrote on diverse subjects including the history of French banking and Russian economics. After teaching at the university of [[Clermont-Ferrand]], he became a director of studies at the [[École pratique des hautes études]], as well as giving a course on the history of technology at the [[University of Paris I: Panthéon-Sorbonne]].

== Early career ==
After studying at the [[École Nationale des Chartes]], in 1943 Gille completed his thesis on the French iron industry, ''Les Origines de la grande industrie métallurgique en France'' (published 1947). In 1959 Gille published his doctoral thesis, ''La Banque et le crédit en France de 1815 à 1848'', part of a longer work derived from the archives of several French banks. This in turn led to the publication of the two-volume, 1000 page, ''Histoire de la maison [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]]'' (1965, 1967).

== History of technology ==
In 1962 Gille published the first volume of ''Histoire générale des techniques'', followed in 1965 by volume two. Between these he published ''Les ingénieurs de la Renaissance'' (1964; re-edited 1978). In 1978 he published his magisterial ''Histoire des techniques'', in which he developed his concept of "technical systems." Although it was a collaborative work, Gille himself wrote 1300 out of a total 1500 pages. This was followed by a work on [[ancient Greek technology and innovation|ancient Greek technology]] entitled ''Les Mécaniciens grecs, la naissance de la technologie'' (1980). In the same year he published ''Petites questions et grands problèmes: la brouette'', on the history of the [[wheelbarrow]].

== Awards ==
Gille was a Corresponding Member of the [[Society for the History of Technology]], which in 1970 awarded him its highest honour, the [[Leonardo da Vinci Medal]].

== Influence ==
Gille's theoretical work on the history of technology was an important influence on the French philosopher of technology, [[Bernard Stiegler]], and in particular on his book, ''[[Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]]''.

== Bibliography ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2067">'''Cadmus of Miletus''' ({{lang-grc|Κάδμος ὁ Μιλήσιος}}, ''Kádmos ho Milésios'') was according to some ancient authorities, the oldest of the ''[[logographi]]''. Modern scholars who accept this view, assign him to about 550 BC; others regard him as purely mythical. A confused notice in the [[Suda]] mentions three persons of the name: the first, the inventor of the [[alphabet]]; the second, the son of [[Pandion (hero)|Pandion]], according to some the first [[prose]] writer, a little later than [[Orpheus]], author of a history of the foundation of [[Miletus]] and of [[Ionia]] generally, in four books; the third, the son of Archelaus, of later date, author of a history of [[Attica]] in fourteen books, and of some poems of an [[erotic]] character. As [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (''Judicium de Thucydide'', c. 23) distinctly states that the work current in his time under the name of Cadmus was a forgery, it is most probable that the two first are identical with the [[Phoenicia]]n [[Cadmus]], who, as the reputed inventor of letters, was subsequently transformed into the Milesian and the author of an historical work. In this connection it should be observed that the old Milesian nobles traced their descent back to the Phoenician or one of his companions. The text of the notice of the third Cadmus of Miletus in the [[Suda]] is unsatisfactory; and it is uncertain whether he is to be explained in the same way, or whether he was an historical personage, of whom all further record is lost.

'''Ebbe Carsten Hornemann Hertzberg''' (11 April 1847 – 2 October 1912) was a Norwegian professor and social economist. He was also a [[Legal history|legal historian]]  and published several works in that field.&lt;ref name=SNL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Ebbe_Carsten_Hornemann_Hertzberg|title=Ebbe Carsten Hornemann Hertzberg|last=Mardal|first=Magnus A.|publisher=[[Store Norske Leksikon]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Hertzberg was born at [[Holmestrand]] in  [[Vestfold]], Norway.  He was the son of Johan Christian Linde Hertzberg (1816–84) and Inger Horneman (1820–95). He attended the [[University of Christiania]] (now University of Oslo). In 1868, he was awarded the Crown Prince's gold medal (''Kronprinsens gullmedalje'') for  a thesis regarding  changes in Norwegian  judicial institutions. He graduated as [[cand.jur.]] in 1870.
He earned a travel scholarship and studied at [[Uppsala University]] from 1870. From 1872 to 1873, he studied under   legal historian [[Konrad Maurer]] at the [[University of Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/wiki/Ebbe_Hertzberg
|title=  Ebbe Hertzberg|publisher=  lokalhistoriewiki.no|accessdate= February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed professor of statistics and economics  at the [[University of Christiania ]] in 1877. He was a short-time government minister during April-June 1884 as  a member of the Council of State Division in [[Stockholm]].

In 1886, Hertzberg withdrew from public life and moved away from [[Oslo|Kristiania]] for a decade. Officially, this was motivated by a desire to focus on his research, but in reality he been pushed to resign by the university after admitting to being homosexual.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; During his exile in [[Berlin]], [[Holmestrand]], [[Munich]] and Stockholm, he completed his greatest work, a [[glossary]] of historic Norwegian legal terms, ''Glossarium til Norges gamle love''.&lt;ref name="SNL"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

In 1896, he returned to [[Oslo|Kristiania]] where in 1903 he became director of [[Norges Hypotekbank]] and in 1906 he was appointed as an administrator in the [[National Archives of Norway |National Archives]]. In 1901, he was awarded  Knight 1st Class  and in 1907 was decorated  Commander of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]].

The '''Ennead''' or '''Great Ennead''' was a group of nine [[Egyptian pantheon|deities]] in [[Egyptian mythology]] worshiped at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]: the [[sun god]] [[Atum]]; his children [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and [[Tefnut]]; their children [[Geb]] and [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]]; and their children [[Osiris]], [[Isis]], [[Seth (mythology)|Seth]], and [[Nephthys]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/937102309|title=Gods and men in Egypt : 3000 BCE to 395 CE|last=Dunand|first=Françoise|last2=Zivie-Coche|first2=Christiane|authorlink=Françoise Dunand|location=Ithaca, NY|year=2004|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801488532|oclc=937102309}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ennead sometimes includes the son of Osiris and Isis, [[Horus]]. It rose to importance in [[Dynasty V|Dynasties V]] and [[Dynasty VI|VI]] and remained prominent in Egypt into its [[Ptolemaic Egypt|occupation]] by the [[ancient Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] established by [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[diadochi|successor]] in the area, [[Ptolemy I]].

The Great Ennead was only one of several such groupings of nine deities in ancient Egypt and its claims to preeminence by its Heliopolitan priests were not respected throughout Egypt.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creation Accounts in the Ancient Near East|last=Clifford|first=Richard|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=99-116}}&lt;/ref&gt; As close as [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] (also within modern [[Cairo]]), the priests of [[Ptah]] celebrated him as superior to the Nine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to Memphis having its own creation myth, the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]]/Hermopolitan centered around physical creation and 8 primordial gods was another creation story that existed at the same time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ennead is a borrowing via [[Latin]] of the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] name ''Enneás'' ({{lang|grc|Ἐννεάς}}), meaning "the Nine".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=ennead, ''n.'' |title=Oxford English Dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |contribution-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/62478 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was a [[calque]] of the Egyptian name, written ''{{lang|egy|Psḏt}}'' and also meaning "the Nine". Its original pronunciation is uncertain, since hieroglyphs do not record vowels. [[Egyptologist]]s conventionally transcribe it as ''Pesedjet''.

==History==
The [[ancient Egyptians]] created several enneads as their [[unification of Egypt|unification]] under [[Dynasty I]] brought numerous local cults into contact with one another. The ancient Egyptian mythology often had many different explanations for the same phenomenon. This concept is especially unique because no single story was more accurate than another, but rather the truth was a mix of them all&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The [[Pyramid Texts]] of [[Dynasty V|Dynasties V]] and [[Dynasty VI|VI]] mention the "Great Ennead", the "Lesser Ennead", the "Dual Ennead", and the "Seven Enneads". Some [[pharaoh]]s established enneads that [[apotheosis|incorporated themselves as gods]]. The most notable case is [[Seti I]] of [[Dynasty XIX]], whose temple at [[Redesiyah]] celebrated an ennead of six major gods and three deified forms of himself. In the [[Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days]],&lt;ref&gt;Papyrus Cairo 86637.&lt;/ref&gt; the ennead mentioned may reference the [[Pleiades]].{{sfnp|Jetsu &amp; al.|2015}}

The most important was the "Great" or "Heliopolitan Ennead" of Awanu ({{lang-egy|I͗wnw}}), known under the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Greeks]] and [[Roman Egypt|Romans]] as [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]. It celebrated the family of the [[sun god]] [[Atum]] (sometimes referred to as Atum-[[Atum-re|Re]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) and thrived from the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] to the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic period]].

Its development remains uncertain, although it appears to have first appeared when [[Ra (god)|Ra]]'s cult—supreme under [[Dynasty V]]—declined in importance under [[Dynasty VI]]. [[Egyptologist]]s have traditionally theorized that the Heliopolitan priesthood established it to establish the preeminence of Atum over the others, incorporating some major gods in lesser positions and omitting others entirely. The most prominent of such deities was [[Osiris]], [[vegetation deity|god of vegetation]] and the [[Egyptian netherworld|afterlife]], who was incorporated into the Ennead as Atum's great-grandson. However, in the 20th century, some Egyptologists{{Who|date=December 2009}} question the whole scenario. After the Great Ennead was well established, the cult of Ra—[[syncretization|identified with]] Atum—recovered much of its importance until superseded by the cult of [[Horus (god)|Horus]]. The two were then combined as Ra–Horus of the Horizons.

{{anchor|Legend|Legends|Myth}}

==Myths==
According to the [[creation story]] of the Heliopolitan priests, the world originally consisted of the primordial waters of precreation personified as [[Naunet|Nun]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From it arose a mound on the First Occasion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Upon the mound sat the self-begotten god [[Atum]], who was equated with the [[sun god]] [[Ra (god)|Ra]]. [[Atum]] evolved from Nun through self-creation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Atum either [[spitting|spat]] or [[masturbation|masturbated]], producing [[Air (classical element)|air]] personified as [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and [[humidity|moisture]] personified as [[Tefnut]]. The siblings Shu and Tefnut mated to produce the earth personified as [[Geb]] and the nighttime sky personified as [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]].

Geb and Nut were the parents of [[Osiris (god)|Osiris]] and [[Isis (goddess)|Isis]] and of [[Set (god)|Set]] and [[Nephthys]], who became respective couples in turn. Osiris and Isis represent fertility and order, while Set and Nephthys represent chaos to balance out Osiris and Isis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Horus]], the son of Osiris and Isis, is often included in this creation tradition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to the duality of Ancient Egyptian myths, this is only one of [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths|many creation stories]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Egyptians believed no specific myth was more correct than the other, rather that some combination of these myths was correct.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This creation story, the Heliopolitan tradition, is one of physiological creation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The other major creation traditions are the [[Memphite Theology|Memphite]] Tradition and Hermopolitian/[[Ogdoad creation myth|Ogdoad]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{History of Japan |image=Shoso-in.jpg |caption=[[Shōsōin]]}}

{{nihongo|'''Genna'''|元和}} was a {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]|年号|''nengō''|"year" name"}} coming after ''[[Keichō]]'' and before ''[[Kan'ei]].''  This period spanned the years from July 1615 to February 1624.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Genna''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=  ''Japan encyclopedia'', p. 239;] n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File].&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning emperor was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Mizunoo of Japan|Go-Mizunoo]]''-tennō''|後水尾天皇}}.&lt;ref&gt;Tittsingh, Isaac. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA410,M1  ''Annales des empereurs du japon'', pp. 410]–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change of era==
* '''1615''' {{nihongo|''Genna gannen''|元和元年}}: The era name was changed to mark the enthronement of [[Emperor Go-Mizunoo of Japan|Go-Mizunuoo]] and because of disasters such as the {{nihongo|[[Siege of Osaka]]|大坂の役,|''Ōsaka-no-eki''}}, or more commonly -- {{nihongo|Siege of Osaka|大坂の陣,|''Ōsaka-no-jin''}}. The old era ended and a new one commenced in ''Keichō'' 20.

The Siege of Osaka was a series of battles undertaken by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] against the [[Toyotomi clan]], and ending in that clan's destruction. Divided into two stages (the "Winter Campaign" and the "Summer Campaign"), and lasting from 1614 through 1615, the siege put an end to the last major armed opposition to the establishment of an enduring Tokugawa shogunate. The end of this period of fighting is also sometimes called the {{nihongo|[[Siege of Osaka|Genna Armistice]]|元和偃武,|''Genna-enbu''}} because the [[Japanese era name|era name]] was changed from ''[[Keichō]]'' to ''Genna'' immediately following its ultimate resolution.

By order of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], the era name of [[Emperor Xianzong of Tang]] China was adopted.

==Events of the ''Genna'' era==

Pineda's scholarly work develops across the disciplines of global studies, urban history, sociology, politics, [[Objectivist philosophy]] and global history. His research has been published in a variety of social science magazines and journals, including ''The National Catholic Reporter'', ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'', ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'', etc. He has written non-scholarly articles for the online blogs since 2005.

His MSc research is related to the [http://rudar.ruc.dk/handle/1800/12416 Libertarian Free Cities in a global studies focus].  This project is the first academic research in the field of large scale city-building projects in Latin America.  He has also examined how cultural and national identities are constructed through conflicting collective memories in a political and cultural environment defined by historically changing borders and discourses in Guinea-Bissau and India.

After his MA from [[Leipzig University]], Pineda has engaged various areas of research. He writes and publishes on urban history and city-building from a global studies perspective.

Pineda worked as a teacher of Objectivist philosophy with high school and undergraduate students from 2009-11.  He completed three and a half years of study at the [http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=education_academic_index Objectivist Academic Center].  He has lectured at international conferences on the [http://www.atlassociety.org/as/history-capitalism-part-1 history of capitalism] and currently does research related to urban anthropology and global studies at Roskilde University. In 2010 he edited an ebook version of Frederic Bastiat's essay ''[[The Law (1850 book)|The Law]]''.

Pineda is principally interested in how social sciences ideas and approaches can inform global political and global social theory in the study of contemporary politics and contemporary history.

In recent work Pineda has sought to develop an anthropological approach to city-building and [[Saskia Sassen]]'s [[global cities]]. In 2013 he published a project studying [[2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'état|the military coup]] staged by [[Guinea-Bissau]]’s army on the evening of 12 April 2012 and its linkage to foreign and local drug barons. Pineda proposed in his project that Guinea-Bissau should be recognized as the first legitimate [[narco-state]] in Africa and the world.

Via participation in the yearly held [http://www.atlassociety.org/as/history-capitalism-part-1 Atlas Summit] in Washington, DC, Pineda has also taken an interest in [[Ayn Rand|Ayn Rand's]] philosophy and the methodological applications of Rand's philosophy to the study of global history and the history of capitalism.

His current research in Denmark involves the history of anthropological thought in the study of urbanism, and the connections between global approaches to social theory.

==Teaching career==
Pineda taught a broad spectrum of Socratic dialogues at [[Francisco Marroquín University]] while working as executive director of the [[Center for the Study of Capitalism]]. These included areas such as: Objectivist philosophy, history of liberty, free market economics, sociology, and politics. His career includes over ten years of experience in teaching and student advising at institutions in Latin America.

'''Harry M. Caudill''' (May 3, 1922 &amp;ndash; November 29, 1990) was an [[Americans|American]] author, historian, lawyer, legislator, and environmentalist from [[Letcher County, Kentucky|Letcher County]], in the coalfields of southeastern [[Kentucky]].

==Biography==
Caudill served in [[World War II]] as a private in the U.S. Army and was elected three times as to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives|Kentucky State House of Representatives]].  He taught in the History Department at the [[University of Kentucky]] from 1976 to 1984.

A common theme explored in many of Caudill's writings is the historic underdevelopment of the [[Appalachia]]n region (particularly his own home area of southeastern Kentucky). In several of his books (most prominently ''[[Night Comes to the Cumberlands]]'', 1962) and many of his published articles, he probes the historical poverty of the region, which he attributes in large part to the rapacious policies of the [[coal mining]] industries active in the region, as well as their backers: bankers of the northeastern United States.  He notes that such interests most often had their headquarters not in Appalachia but in the Northeast or Midwest, and thus failed to properly reinvest their sizable profits in the Appalachian region. Following publication of ''Night Comes to the Cumberlands'', President [[John F. Kennedy]] appointed a commission to investigate conditions in the region and subsequently more than $15 billion in aid was invested in the region over twenty-five years.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|author=Glenn Fowler|title=Harry M. Caudill, 68, Who Told of Appalachian Poverty|work=[[New York Times]]|date=December 1, 1990|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/01/obituaries/harry-m-caudill-68-who-told-of-appalachian-poverty.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Harry%20M.%20Caudill&amp;st=cse|accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In his later years he became an active opponent of the rapidly growing practice of [[strip mining]] as practiced by companies working in Appalachia, which he believed was causing irreparable harm to the land and its people.  He published articles in many magazines in addition to speaking out about the subject. Caudill pointed out that strip mining could be done responsibly as in [[England]], [[Germany]], and [[Czechoslovakia]] where [[topsoil]], [[subsoil]], and rocks are removed separately and placed back in layers in their original order.&lt;ref name=mcc&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David McCullough]]|title=[[Brave Companions: Portraits in History]]|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992|page=163f|isbn=0-671-79276-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caudill became interested in the work of [[William Bradford Shockley Jr.|William Shockley]], a scientist with controversial eugenicist stances at Stanford University in California. Caudill came to believe in Shockley's theory of "dysgenics," the argument that unintelligent people weaken the genes of a 'race' over time. He felt that "genetic decline" in Eastern Kentucky contributed to issues of poverty. "The slobs continue to multiply," Caudill wrote in a 1975 letter to Time magazine. The editors of Time rejected Caudill's letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cheves|first1=John|last2=Estep|first2=Bill|title=Chapter 4: Disillusioned, Harry Caudill blames 'genetic decline' in Eastern Kentucky|url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/special-reports/fifty-years-of-night/article44394057.html|website=Lexington Herald Leader|publisher=Lexington Herald Leader|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also produced several volumes of [[folklore]] and [[oral history]], which he collected himself from residents of the area centering on [[Letcher County, Kentucky|Letcher County]] and [[Harlan County, Kentucky]].  One of those oral history interviews in 1941 of a man who would have been about 90 years old, was the basis for the 1995 movie, "Pharoah's Army," starring Chris Cooper, Patricia Clarkson, and Kris Kristofferson.

Caudill killed himself with a gunshot to the head in 1990, faced with an advancing case of [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;  He is buried in Battle Grove Cemetery, [[Cynthiana, Kentucky]].

==Legacy==
The Harry M. Caudill Library located in [[Whitesburg, Kentucky]], the main library of the Letcher County Public Library District, is named for Caudill.

==Quote==
"And we just can't afford to sit back and watch all that (land) be destroyed so a few people can get rich now. One of these days the dear old federal government is going to have to come in and spend billions of dollars just to repair the damage that's already been done. And guess who will have the machines and the workmen to do the job? The same coal operators who made the mess in the first place will be hired to fix it back, and the taxpayers will bear the cost."&lt;ref name=mcc/&gt;

==Works==
[[Image:Hecataeus world map-en.svg|thumb|right|280px|Reconstruction of Hecataeus' map]]

Two works by Hecateus are known: Περίοδος γῆς (''Periodos ges'', "Journey round the Earth" or "World Survey") and  Γενεαλογίαι (''Genealogiai'') or the Ἱστορία (''Historia''). However, they only survive in fragments.&lt;ref&gt;"Hecataeus" in ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' 3rd. ed. [[Oxford]]; [[Oxford University Press]] 1999 pp.670-1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Periodos ges''  ===

''Periodos ges'' was written in two books, the first on Europe, the second on Asia, in which he included Africa. The book is a comprehensive work on geography beginning at the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] and going [[clockwise]] ending at the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]] of [[Morocco]] following the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]]. Hecataeaus provides information about the people and places that would be encountered on a coastal voyage between these points, as well as the inhabitants of the various [[Mediterranean islands]], the [[Scythians]], [[Persia]], [[India]], [[Egypt]] and [[Nubia]]. Over 300 fragments of this work are preserved, mostly as citations for [[place names]] in the work of [[Stephanus of Byzantium]].&lt;ref&gt;''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.671&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Genealogies'' ===

Hecataeus' other work was a book on [[mythography]] in four books. Less than forty fragments remain. He applied a more skeptical approach to the traditions of families who claimed to be descended from gods.&lt;ref&gt;''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.671&lt;/ref&gt;

One fragment that has survived is the opening "Hecataeus of Miletus thus speaks: I write what I deem true; for the stories of the Greeks are manifold and seem to me ridiculous."{{sfn|Shotwell|1939|p=172}}

[[Herodotus]] (II, 143) tells a story of a visit by Hecataeus to an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] temple at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. It recounts how the priests showed Herodotus a series of statues in the temple's inner sanctum, each one supposedly set up by the high priest of each generation. Hecataeus, says Herodotus, had seen the same spectacle, after mentioning that he traced his descent, through sixteen generations, from a god. The Egyptians compared his genealogy to their own, as recorded by the statues; since the generations of their high priests had numbered three hundred and forty-five, all mortal men, they refused to believe Hecataeus's claim of descent from a god. Historian [[James Shotwell]] has called this encounter with the antiquity of Egypt an influence on Hecataeus's scepticism: he recognized that oral history is untrustworthy.{{sfn|Shotwell|1939|p=172-173}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Ancient Greek Historians''; [[J. B. Bury|Bury, John Bagnell]] (NY, Dover Publications, 1958), pp. 14, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Map ===

Besides his written works, Hecataeus is also credited with improving the map of [[Anaximander]], which he saw as a disc encircled by [[Oceanus]].&lt;ref&gt;''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.671&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==

He was probably the first of the [[Logographer (history)|logographers]] to attempt a serious prose history and to employ critical method to distinguish myth from historical fact, though he accepts [[Homer]] and other poets as trustworthy authorities. Herodotus, though he once at least contradicts his statements, is indebted to Hecataeus for the concept of a prose history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2762">'''Hegesias of Magnesia'''&lt;ref&gt;Magnesia ad Sipylum, on the plains of [[Lydia]].&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἡγησίας ὁ Μάγνης}}), [[Greeks|Greek]] [[rhetoric]]ian, and historian, flourished about 300 BC. [[Strabo]] (xiv. 648), speaks of him as the founder of the florid [[Asiatic style]] of composition.

[[Agatharchides]], [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (''De compositione verborum'' [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924026465165#page/n109/mode/2up 18]) and [[Cicero]] all speak of him in disparaging terms, although [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] seems to have approved of his work. He professed to imitate the simplest style of [[Lysias]], avoiding long periods, and expressing himself in short, jerky sentences, without modulation or finish. His vulgar affectation and bombast made his writings a mere caricature of the old [[Attic]]. Dionysius describes his composition as tinselled, ignoble and effeminate. According to [[Gualtiero Calboli]], Hegesias and his fellow Asiatics rejected Attic examples (and in particular the example of [[Thucydides]]) in favor of a return to "the models of Ionic and [[sophist]]ic prose."&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Nicolai, "''Ktêma es aei'': Aspects of the Reception of Thucydides in the Ancient World," in Jeffrey Rusten (ed.) ''Thucydides: Oxford Readings in Classical Studies'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=XFPghh2u-z0C&amp;lpg=PA386&amp;dq=hegesias%20rusten&amp;pg=PA386#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 386]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally supposed, from the fragment quoted as a specimen by Dionysius (and cf. [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/3.html#3.6 3]), that Hegesias is to be classed among the writers of lives of [[Alexander the Great]]. This fragment describes the treatment of [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and its inhabitants by Alexander after its conquest, but it is possible that it is only part of an epideictic or show speech, not of an historical work. This view is supported by a remark of Agatharchides in [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] (cod. 250) that the only aim of Hegesias was to exhibit his skill in describing sensational events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7897">'''Hillel Schwartz''' (born 1948) is an American [[cultural historian]], [[poet]] and [[Translation|translator]].

==Education and teaching==
Hillel Schwartz was born in Chicago and got his B.A. degree at [[Brandeis University]] in 1969. He went on to earn a Ph.D. in European History at [[Yale University]] (1974), and the following year he got a master's degree in library science (M.L.S.) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

Schwartz considers himself primarily an independent scholar, but he has also taught history, humanities, and religious studies at UC Berkeley (1975), the University of Florida, Gainesville (1975–77), San Diego State University (1979–82, 1996). Most recently, he was an instructor in the History Department at UC San Diego (1992).

Schwartz has been both a fellow at and an adviser to the Millennium Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit organization founded in the 1980s to work on global sustainability issues.&lt;ref&gt;Gallacher, Lynn. [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/legacy/programs/atoday/stories/s249556.htm "Hillel Schwartz &amp; the Millenniium Institute"]. ''Arts Today'', Feb. 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwartz lives in [[Encinitas, California]].&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, Peter Andrey, [http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/01/the-society-for-the-suppression-of-unnecessary-noise.html The Society for the Suppression of Unnecessary Noise], ''The New Yorker'' online, 21 January 2013. Accessed 19 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Schwartz, who has been called a "peripatetic cultural historian," has written on the [[French prophets]], [[millenarianism]], and [[Copying|copies]], as well as on the history of [[dieting]], [[fat]], and [[noise]]. His scholarship is formidable, with one of his recent books, ''Making Noise'', sporting 350 pages of notes.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; Schwartz's work has been translated into German, Italian, Japanese, and Portuguese.

''Making Noise'' examines the changing understanding of sound in western culture—from music to tinnitis, babies' cries to urban hubbub—demonstrating that the primacy of the visual in human experience has been somewhat oversold.&lt;ref&gt;Vandevelde, Tom. "Materializing Modernist Sound: Towards a Framework for the Study of Narrative Sound." (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Culture of the Copy'' is a comprehensive 600-page exploration of doubles of all kinds: facsimiles, reproductions, fakes, twins, mannequins, [[trompe l'oeil]] painting, camouflage, and so on. Schwartz examines how copies have been framed in western culture over the centuries, with a particular interest in the ethical dimensions of our relationship to replicas. Schwartz takes the position that copies are an important part of our cultural inheritance and should not be immediately dismissed as inauthentic.&lt;ref&gt;Tofts, Darren John. "'The World Will Be Tlon': Mapping the Fantastic onto the Virtual." ''Postmodern Culture'' 13, no. 2 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Losh, Elizabeth. "Reading Room(s): Building a National Archive in Digital Spaces and Physical Places." ''Literary and Linguistic Computing'' 19, no. 3 (2004): 373-384.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Never Satisfied'' (1986), Schwartz surveys the history of dieting fads and changing fashions in body types, with attention to major cultural shifts around the turn of the 20th century attendant on the rise of consumer culture.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, Amy Erdman. "The Narrowing of American Bodies: Christian Fitness Culture and the Politics of Body Size Reduction." ''American Quarterly'' 58, no. 2 (2006): 517-522.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kersh, Rogan, and James Morone. "How the Personal Becomes Political: Prohibitions, Public Health, and Obesity." ''Studies in American Political Development'' 16, no. 02 (2002): 162-175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Michael Tavel. "Fat Shame: Stigma and the Fat Body in American Culture". Book review in ''Journal of Social History'' 46, no. 4 (2013): 1077-1079.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The French Prophets'', Schwartz's 1980 book on French prophets of the 18th century, has been called an excellent historical monograph &lt;ref&gt;Popkin, Richard H. "Christian Interest and Concerns About Sabbatai Zevi." In ''Millenarianism and Messianism in Early Modern European Culture'', pp. 91-106. Springer Netherlands, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first systematic exploration of these prophets' origins.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Jon. "''The French Prophets: The History of a Millenarian Group in Eighteenth-Century England''". Book review in ''Church History'' 51, no. 02 (1982): 225-226.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Century's End'', Schwartz analyzes the fuss that is persistently made over millennial dates, publishing his "wise and humane" survey in anticipation of the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Shostak, Arthur B. "Reflections on Teaching About Utopias: Oh What a Lift That Phantom Offers!" ''Thinking Creatively in Turbulent Times'' (2004): 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwartz is also the co-founder of Sage Case Management, a California company that advocates on behalf of people who are terminally ill or in need of complex medical care. This experience led him to write his most recent book, ''Long Days Last Days'' (2013), a highly personal and deeply informed guide to the experience of accompanying another person through their last days on earth.

As a poet, Schwartz has been published in ''Beloit Poetry Journal'', ''The Fiddlehead'', ''Prairie Schooner'', ''Field'', and [[James Tate (writer)|James Tate]]'s survey, ''The Best American Poetry 1997''.

Schwartz was co-translator (with Sunny Jung) of poems by the South Korean poet [[Ko Un]], published by Tupelo Press under the title ''Abiding Places: Korea North and South'' (2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4715">'''Historians without Borders''' is a Finnish organisation. It was founded at the initiative of [[Erkki Tuomioja]], the former foreign minister of Finland. The purpose of the organization is to further public discussion about history and to promote the use of historical knowledge for peace-building and conflict-resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.finlandia.org.pt/public/default.aspx?contentid=356500&amp;culture=fi-FI| title = Historioitsijat ilman rajoja - Suomen suurlähetystö, Lissabon : Ajankohtaista| work = www.finlandia.org.pt| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation has an international network of Historians without Borders and coordinating committee, with which the organisation aims to promote their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.historianswithoutborders.fi/yhdistys/| title = Yhdistys - Historians without Borders| work = Historians without Borders| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In June 2015, Erkki tuomioja convened a number of historians and policy makers to a meeting, which led to the founding of HWB. First board was appointed, which included names like Finnish politician and historian Pilvi Torsti, former editor-in-chief of [[Helsingin Sanomat]] [[Janne Virkkunen]] and executive director of [[Crisis Management Initiative|C]]MI Tuija Talvitie. Erkki Tuomioja has acted as Chairman of the Board since the founding meeting. Behind the initiative was Tuomioja´s concern, that history is often used and abused for personal or political purposes. Inadequate knowledge of history makes people more vulnerable to manipulation of politicians, who can use historical myths and propaganda to their advantage easier. HWB aims to prevent the abuse of history by bringing historians and their knowledge to society and conflict-resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.finlandia.org.pt/public/default.aspx?contentid=356500&amp;culture=fi-FI| title = Historioitsijat ilman rajoja - Suomen suurlähetystö, Lissabon : Ajankohtaista| work = www.finlandia.org.pt| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HWB has aimed from the beginning to the wider international co-operation between historians across the borders. With this in mind, HWB organised in May 2016 and international conference "Historians without Borders: The Use and Abuse of History in Conflicts" at the University of Helsinki. Around 300 participants gathered in Helsinki and the conference ended with the creation of an international network of Historians without Borders and the appointment of a Coordinating Committee. Members of this committee are Jan C. Behrends, [[Carl Bildt]], Vasu Gounden, [[Margaret MacMillan]], Erkki Tuomioja, Christina Twomey and Sergei Zhuravlev. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000002832711.html| title = Historioitsijat tarjoavat apua konfliktien ratkaisuun| work = Helsingin Sanomat| date = 2015-06-18| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-8897872| title = Historioitsijat järjestäytyivät rauhan puolesta| work = Yle Uutiset| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://areena.yle.fi/1-3394283| title = Historian käyttö ja väärinkäyttö konflikteissa {{!}} Tiedeykkönen| work = areena.yle.fi| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/13988-social-media-is-a-powerful-tool-in-conflicts-warns-ahtisaari.html| title = Social media is a powerful tool in conflicts, warns Ahtisaari| author = Aleksi Teivainen| work = Helsinki Times| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dailysabah.com/op-ed/2016/05/18/abuse-of-history-and-historians-without-borders| title = Abuse of history and Historians without Borders| work = DailySabah| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims ==

* promote and deepen general and comprehensive knowledge and understanding of history
* promote open and free access to historical material and archives
* promote interactive dialogue between different views and interpretations of history to bring closer diverging views of the course of historical events 
* support efforts to impede the abuse of history to foster conflicts or to sustain enemy images and distorted myths, and to contribute to the use of history in defusing and resolving conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.historianswithoutborders.fi/yhdistys/| title = Yhdistys - Historians without Borders| work = Historians without Borders| accessdate = 2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2402">'''Abu'l Fada'il Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Ali ibn Muzhir ibn Barakat''', commonly known as '''Ibn Nazif al-Hamawi''' (/[[ALA-LC]]: ''Ibn Naẓīf al-Ḥamawī''), was a 13th-century Muslim chronicler and historian of the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] era.

==Biography==
There is scant biographical information about Ibn Nazif, and most information about him comes from his chronicle.&lt;ref name="Mallet245"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallet|first1=Alex|editor1-last=Thomas|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Mallet|editor2-first=Alex|title=Christian-Muslim Relations.

'''Ivo Banac''' ({{IPA-sh|iːʋo baːnats|hr}}; born 1 March 1947) is a [[Croats|Croatian]] historian, a long-time history professor at [[Yale University]] and was a politician of the former [[Liberal Party (Croatia)|Liberal Party]] in Croatia. {{As of|2012}}, Banac is a consultant for the [[Bosnian Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/about/staff.cfm|title=Bosnian Institute - People|publisher=[[Bosnian Institute]]|accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Banac was born in Dubrovnik in 1947. In 1959 he emigrated to the United States with his mother, reuniting with his father who had escaped from Yugoslavia in 1947.&lt;ref name="Nacional20030408"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/13420/ivo-banac-americki-profesor-protiv-balkanskih-politicara |title=Ivo Banac - Američki profesor protiv balkanskih političara |trans-title=Ivo Banac - US professor against Balkan politicians |publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] |date=8 April 2003 |last=Bajruši |first=Robert |language=Croatian |accessdate=July 3, 2012 |archivedate=3 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68sYYu86a?url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/13420/ivo-banac-americki-profesor-protiv-balkanskih-politicara |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his father's death in a traffic accident a year later, Ivo lived with his mother in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name="Nacional20030408"/&gt; where he studied history at the [[Fordham University]], graduating in 1969.&lt;ref name="IRB izobrazba"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://tkojetko.irb.hr/znanstvenikDetalji.php?sifznan=9771&amp;podaci=izobrazba|title=Ivo Banac - Izobrazba|work=Tko je tko u hrvatskoj znanosti|publisher=[[Ruđer Bošković Institute]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Banac moved to [[California]],&lt;ref name="Nacional20030408"/&gt; where he obtained M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="IRB izobrazba"/&gt; Although he was a member of [[Students for a Democratic Society]], by his own account he was not attracted by the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] [[flower power]] movement of the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="Nacional20030408"/&gt;

Banac worked at the Stanford University Department of History and Linguistics from 1972 to 1977,&lt;ref name="IRB zaposlenja"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://tkojetko.irb.hr/znanstvenikDetalji.php?sifznan=9771&amp;podaci=zaposlenja|title=Ivo Banac - Zaposlenja|work=Tko je tko u hrvatskoj znanosti|publisher=[[Ruđer Bošković Institute]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then moved back to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] to teach at [[Yale University]]. While at Yale, he earned his [[tenure]], and was a two-time master of [[Pierson College]].&lt;ref name="Nacional20030408"/&gt;

During his stay in the United States, Banac regularly visited Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="Nacional20030408"/&gt; While visiting Zagreb in 1971, he met [[Vlado Gotovac]] and [[Franjo Tuđman]], who would both become major Croatian political figures after the fall of communism.&lt;ref name="Nacional20030408"/&gt; Banac remained in close contact with Gotovac until his death in   2000;&lt;ref name="Nacional20030408"/&gt; on the other hand, he reportedly didn't think highly of Tuđman, describing him as a person who could not tolerate dissent.&lt;ref name="Nacional20030408"/&gt; Nonetheless, Banac organized Tuđman's lecture at [[Yale University]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="Nacional20030408"/&gt; In 1990, Banac was accepted as an associate member in the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.hazu.hr/ivo_banac_biografija|language=Croatian|title=Ivo Banac profile|work=Članovi Akademije|publisher=[[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]|accessdate=2010-11-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427102712/http://info.hazu.hr/ivo_banac_biografija|archivedate=2010-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1994 and 1999 he was the director of the Institute on Southern Europe at the [[Central European University]], [[Budapest]]. From 1990 onwards, Ivo Banac was also active in Croatian politics. He joined the [[Croatian Social Liberal Party]] (HSLS) and became one of the strongest critics of [[Franjo Tuđman]] and his government, especially with regards to policy towards [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He expressed his criticism in a column written for ''[[Feral Tribune]]''. After the HSLS split in 1997, Banac joined the [[Liberal Party (Croatia)|Liberal Party]], keeping a critical distance towards the government even after LS became part of a new governing left-centre coalition in 2000.

He often accused [[Ivica Račan]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]] of not doing enough to reverse the negative policies of Tuđman's era. Many were surprised to find Banac, who had a reputation of a maverick and independent intellectual, become the leader of the LS. It was even more surprising to see him take the post of Minister of Environmental Protection in 2003. He held that post for only a few months, until the SDP - the party with whom the LS was aligned - lost the election to a rejuvenated HDZ. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

He was elected to the Croatian Parliament in the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003]].&lt;ref name="Sabor"/&gt; After the elections, Banac advocated a merger of all liberal parties in Croatia. This policy was opposed by [[Zlatko Kramarić]] who orchestrated Banac's removal from the party leadership in 2004. Banac left the LS in February 2005 and was an independent representative in the [[Sabor]] for the rest of his term.&lt;ref name="Sabor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=298|language=Croatian|title=Ivo Banac - nezavisni|work=Zastupnici 5. saziva Hrvatskoga sabora|publisher=[[Croatian Parliament]]|accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was publicly criticized for having allegedly mishandled public funds, by renting his personal apartment to himself as office space, as well as furnishing it with taxpayers money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/ovo-su-ljudi-koji-cuvaju-ugled-sabora/195947|language=Croatian|newspaper=[[Jutarnji list]]|title=Ovo su ljudi koji čuvaju ugled Sabora|date=2009-02-24|accessdate=2010-11-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213232521/http://www.jutarnji.hr/ovo-su-ljudi-koji-cuvaju-ugled-sabora/195947|archivedate=2012-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banac replied, to accusations that such actions constitute mishandling of public funds, that while "the data published in the media are correct, it is all a matter of interpretation, is the glass half full or half empty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/novosti/hrvatska/clanak/id/22351/banac-o-tome-kako-je-sam-sebi-iznajmio-poslovni-prostor-sve-je-legalno|language=Croatian|newspaper=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|title=Banac o tome kako je sam sebi iznajmio poslovni prostor: Sve je legalno!|date=2008-09-23|accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2007 and 2009, Banac was the President of the [[Croatian Helsinki Committee]].

At Yale, he is the Bradford Durfee Professor of History Emeritus.&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.yale.edu/history/faculty/banac.html|title=Ivo Banac|work=www.yale.edu|publisher=[[Yale University]]|accessdate=2010-11-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821060144/http://www.yale.edu/history/faculty/banac.html|archivedate=2010-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as the director of the Council on [[European Studies]] at [[Yale University]].

This collaborative effort allowed the fledgling party to utilize the existing support structure of an established conference.

In January 2009, he formed "[[Archive Team]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiveteam.org/ |title=archiveteam.org |publisher=archiveteam.org |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a group dedicated to preserving the historical record of websites that close down.

In October 2009, he started raising funds for a year-long sabbatical from his job as a computer systems administrator, to pursue technology history and archival projects full-time. By November 2009, he had reached his funding goals, with the support of over 300 patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.kickstarter.com/projects/textfiles/the-jason-scott-sabbatical |title=The Jason Scott Sabbatical |publisher=Kickstarter |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kōwa''' (弘和) was a [[Japanese era name]] (年号, ''nengō'', lit. year name) of the [[Southern Court]] during the [[Nanboku-cho|Era of Northern and Southern Courts]] after [[Tenju]] and before [[Genchū]]. This period spanned the years from February 1381 to April 1384.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Nengō''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA566&amp;dq=  ''Japan encyclopedia'', p. 566;] n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Court]] emperors in Yoshino during this time-frame were {{nihongo|[[Emperor Chōkei]]|長慶天皇| ''Chōkei-tennō''}} and {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Kameyama]]|後亀山天皇|''Go-Kameyama-tennō}}.

==Nanboku-chō overview==
[[File:Nanbokucho-capitals.svg|thumb|140px|The Imperial seats during the ''Nanboku-chō'' period were in relatively close proximity, but geographically distinct. They were conventionally identified as: {{unordered list|Northern capital : [[Kyoto]] |Southern capital : [[Yoshino, Nara|Yoshino]].}}]]   
During the [[Meiji period]], an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] through [[Emperor Go-Murakami]], whose {{nihongo|Southern Court|南朝|''nanchō''}} had been established in exile in [[Yoshino District|Yoshino]], near Nara.&lt;ref name="concise"&gt;Thomas, Julia Adeney. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Re4djF3oaTMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA199&amp;dq=1911+texbook+controversy#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  ''Reconfiguring modernity: concepts of nature in Japanese political ideology'', p. 199 n57], citing Mehl, Margaret. (1997). ''History and the State in Nineteenth-Century Japan.'' p. 140-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of the [[Edo period]], the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the [[Ashikaga shogunate]] had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies despite the undisputed fact that the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan|Imperial Regalia]] were not in their possession.&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20673">'''Laconophilia''' (also known as '''Laconism''')&lt;ref&gt;Mainly within the context of [[classical scholarship]].&lt;/ref&gt; is love or admiration of [[Sparta]] and of the Spartan culture or constitution. The term derives from [[Laconia]], the part of the [[Peloponnesus]] where the Spartans lived.

Admirers of the Spartans typically praise their valour and success in war, their "[[laconic]]" austerity and self-restraint, their [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]ic and [[virtue|virtuous]] ways, the [[Eunomia (goddess)|stable order]] of their political life, and their constitution, with its tripartite [[mixed government]]. Ancient Laconophilia started to appear as early as the 5th century BC, and even contributed a new verb to {{lang-grc|λακωνίζειν}} (literally: to act like a Laconian). Praise of the Spartan city-state persisted within classical literature ever afterward, and surfaced again during the [[Renaissance]].

==Ancient Laconophilia ==

===Athens===
In ancient Athens, Laconism began as a current of thought and feeling after the [[Persian Wars]]. Some, like [[Cimon]], son of [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]], believed that Athens should ally with Sparta against the [[Persian Empire]]. [[Cimon]] persuaded the Athenians to send soldiers to aid Sparta, when the [[helot]]s (serfs of the Spartans) revolted and fortified Mount [[Ithome]]. The Spartans sent the Athenians home again with thanks, lest democratic Athenian ideas influence the helots or the ''[[perioeci]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0247%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D102 ''History of the Peloponnesian War'' I.102]; De Ste. Croix (1972) 76; [[Plutarch]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0017%3Achapter%3D16%3Asection%3D1 ''Cimon'' 16.1ff].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Athenians, especially those who disliked commerce, preferred a [[open society|closed society]] and the [[oligarchy|rule of the few]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} They believed that the Spartan constitution was superior to their own. Some even went so far as to imitate Spartan manners by going around Athens long-haired and unwashed, like the [[Spartiate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristophanes]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0026&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1281 ''Birds'' 1281]; Plato Comicus ''Fragmenta'' 132 (PCG); Epilycus ''Fragmenta'' 4 (PCG).&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's ''Republic'', which is set in the 5th century BC, gives credence to this claim by having Socrates opine that the Spartan or [[Crete|Cretan]] type of political regime is the favorite of "the many".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168&amp;layout=&amp;loc=8.544c Republic VIII, 544c].&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of extreme Laconising oligarchs, known as the [[Thirty Tyrants]], seized power in Athens in 404 BC and held it for eleven months, assisted by a Spartan army. Their rule, however, was quickly overthrown, and democracy was reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;See the article on the [[Thirty Tyrants]] for references.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 371 BC, the Spartans were defeated in the [[Battle of Leuctra]]. As a result of that defeat, Sparta's allies revolted and the helots of [[Messenia]] were freed. Afterward, the Spartan economy became less able to support professional soldiers, and inequalities between supposedly [[Spartiate|equal citizens]] increased. As a result, the reputation of Sparta, either as a military success or as a guide in domestic affairs, diminished substantially.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Philosophers===
[[Image:Lycurgus.jpg|thumb|[[Lycurgus of Sparta]], legendary founder of the city's constitution]]
Laconophiles nevertheless remained among the philosophers. Some of the young men who followed [[Socrates]] had been Laconophiles. Socrates himself is portrayed as praising the laws of Sparta and Crete.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2006) 38-39; Dawson (1992) 58-59, 61, 74, 103-104; Cartledge ''The Socratics Sparta'' (1999); Plato, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&amp;layout=&amp;loc=Crito+52e ''Crito'' 52e].&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Critias]], a companion of Socrates, helped bring about the [[oligarchic]] rule of the [[Thirty Tyrants]], who were supported by Sparta.   [[Xenophon]], another disciple of Socrates, fought for the Spartans against Athens. Plato also, in his writings, seems to prefer a Spartan-type regime over a democratic one.&lt;ref&gt;See his dialogue the ''Laws''.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aristotle]] regarded the kind of laws adopted by Crete and Sparta as especially apt to produce virtuous and law-abiding citizens, although he also criticises the Cretans and Spartans themselves as incompetent and corrupt, and built on a culture of war.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1102a 1102a7-11].&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek philosophy, therefore, inherited a tradition of praising Spartan law. This was only reinforced when [[Agis IV]] and [[Cleomenes III]] attempted to "restore the ancestral constitution" at Sparta, which no man then living had experienced. This attempt ended with the collapse of the institutions of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]], and one [[Nabis]] established a tyranny in Laconia.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;For (some) references, see the article on [[Agis IV]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In later centuries, Greek philosophers, especially [[Platonists]], often described Sparta as an ideal state, strong, brave, and free from the corruptions of commerce and money.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} These descriptions, of which [[Plutarch]]'s is the most complete, vary in many details.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Plutarch [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2008.01.0047 ''Lycurgus'']; Plutarch ''Instituta Laconica'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2008.01.0199 Greek][http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2008.01.0201 English][http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2008.01.0200 English].&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars have attempted to reconstruct which parts of these utopias the classical Spartans actually practised, which parts Cleomenes, and which later classical authors invented.&lt;ref&gt;Most notably: Ollier (1933); Tigerstedt (1965-72).&lt;/ref&gt;

It became fashionable for the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] to visit Lacedaemon and see the rites of [[Artemis Orthia]], as a sort of tourist attraction – the nearest Greece had to offer to gladiatorial games.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes]]'' II.34. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0044%3Abook%3D2%3Asection%3D34 Latin][http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14988/14988-h/14988-h.htm English]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contrary views ===
Even in ancient cultures, Laconophilia was a tendency, not an absolute. None of the contemporaries of the Lycurgan Constitution praised Sparta without reservations, except the Spartans themselves.

[[Herodotus]] of Dorian [[Halicarnassus]], consistently portrays the Spartans, except when actually facing battle, as rustic, hesitant, uncooperative, corrupt, and naïve. [[Plato]] had [[Socrates]] [[Republic (Plato)|argue]] that a state which really followed the simple life would not need a warrior class; one which was luxurious and aggressive would need a group of philosophers, like Plato himself, to guide and deceive the guardians. Even [[Xenophon]]'s encomium of the [[Constitution of the Lacedaemonians]] is not unalloyed praise.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[Aristotle]] criticises the Spartans in his [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']]: the [[helots]] keep rebelling; the Spartan women are luxurious; the magistrates (and especially the [[ephor]]s) are irresponsible; reaching decisions by the loudest yell in the [[apella]] is silly; the wealth of the citizens is unequal (so that too many are losing the resources necessary to be a citizen and a hoplite); and the Spartiates let each other evade taxes, so the city is poor and the individual citizens are greedy. Above all, the Spartans know no other arts than war, so in peace they are incompetent and corrupt. The [[Cretan]] institutions, he says, are even worse.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Politics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D2%3Asection%3D1269a 1269a]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D2%3Asection%3D1271b 1271b]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the collapse, and idealisation, of Sparta, [[Polybius]] wrote, "My object, then, in this digression is to make it manifest by actual facts that, for guarding their own country with absolute safety, and for preserving their own freedom, the legislation of Lycurgus was entirely sufficient; and &lt;em&gt;for those who are content with these objects&lt;/em&gt; we must concede that there neither exists nor ever has existed a constitution and civil order preferable to that of Sparta."&lt;ref&gt;Polybius ''Histories'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plb.+6.50&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234 VI, 50]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plb.+1.6&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234 I,6]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Laconophilia==
Admiration of Sparta continued in the [[Renaissance]]. [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] agreed that  [[Sparta]] was noteworthy for its long and static existence, but nevertheless asserted that, for ''virtù'' and glory, [[Rome]] was much preferable (''Discourses''). The Elizabethan English constitutionalist [[John Aylmer (English constitutionalist)|John Aylmer]] compared the mixed government of Tudor England with the Spartan republic, stating that "Lacedaemonia [meaning Sparta], [was] the noblest and best city governed that ever was". He commended it as a model for England. The Swiss-French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] contrasted Sparta favourably with Athens in his [[Discourse on the Arts and Sciences]], arguing that its austere constitution was preferable to the more cultured nature of Athenian life.  [[Samuel Adams]] expressed a disappointment that the American republic was failing to meet his ideal of a "Christian Sparta".&lt;ref&gt;http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch18s14.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Hamilton]] mocked the Laconophilia of his era as unrealistic:&lt;blockquote&gt;
We may preach till we are tired of the theme, the necessity of disinterestedness in republics, without making a single proselyte. The virtuous declaimer will neither persuade himself nor any other person to be content with a double mess of porridge, instead of a reasonable stipend for his services. We might as soon reconcile ourselves to the Spartan [[common ownership|community of goods]] and wives, to their iron coin, their long beards, or their [[black broth|Black soup]]. There is a total dissimulation in the circumstances, as well as the manners, of society among us; and it is as ridiculous to seek for models in the simple ages of Greece and Rome, as it would be to go in quest of them among the Hottentots and Laplanders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch18s15.html University of Chicago]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Laconophilia increased in importance during the nineteenth century. The development of the [[public school (UK)|English Public School]]s was influenced by the schooling of Spartan children,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/stiff-upper-lip/biography/spartans-and-stoics-with-stiff-upper-lips Spartans and Stoics with stiff upper lips] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212000000/http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/stiff-upper-lip/biography/spartans-and-stoics-with-stiff-upper-lips |date=2009-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as were [[Ivy League]] American universities. Sparta was also used as a model of social purity by Revolutionary and Napoleonic France. [[Slavoj Žižek]] stated that "all modern egalitarian radicals, from [[Rousseau]] to the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]]…imagined the republican France as a new Sparta".&lt;ref name="The "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacan.com/zizhollywood.htm|last = Žižek|first = Slavoj| authorlink = Slavoj Žižek| title = The True Hollywood Left| publisher = www.lacan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Zionism ===
{{See also|Kibbutz#Communal_life|label 1 = The communal life of the Kibbutz}}
Early Zionists, and particularly the founders of [[Kibbutz]] movement in Israel, had been influenced by Spartan ideals, and drew on the Spartan model in particular when disparaging the materialistic values they associated with the diaspora communities they had left.&lt;ref&gt;''Land and Power: The Zionist Resort to Force, 1881–1948'', By Anita Shapira, Stanford University Press 1999, 300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kafka and Cultural Zionism: Dates in Palestine'' By Iris Bruce, Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2007, page 170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of Israeli Militarism'', By Uri Ben-Eliezer, Indiana University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Tabenkin, for example,  a founding father of the Kibbutz and the [[Palmach]], was greatly influenced by ancient Sparta. He prescribed that "fighters' education should begin from the nursery", that children should from kindergarten age be taken to "spend nights in the mountains and valleys", taught to fight, and educated for war.&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of Israeli Militarism'', By Uri Ben-Eliezer, Indiana University Press, 1998, page 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial Laconophilia===

====Karl Müller====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
[[Image:Karl Otfried Müller - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|Karl Müller]]
A new element was introduced into Laconophilia by [[Karl Otfried Müller]], who linked Spartan ideals to the supposed racial superiority of the [[Dorians]], the ethnic sub-group of the Greeks to which the Spartans belonged. While the Greek Laconophiles like Plutarch had praised the Spartans, they did not extend this admiration to the Dorians as a whole. Plutarch argued that the founder of their constitution, [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]], had inherited corrupt Dorian institutions. [[Argos]], the traditional enemy of Sparta, was also a Dorian state; so were [[Corinth]], [[Rhodes]], and [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], three of the most commercial states in Greece.

In 1824, however, Müller wrote ''Die Dorier'', a history of the Dorian "race". It has been described as a "thousand-page fantasia", which portrays the Dorians as a heroic and noble race who expanded into Greece from the north. He used the new disciplines of [[comparative linguistics]] and [[Quellenförschung|source-criticism]] to argue that the Dorians represented a distinct [[ethno-linguistic]] group whose original culture could be isolated from later influences. He linked the origin of the Dorians to the mythic [[Myrmidons]] of the Trojan war, and their leader [[Achilles]].

====Nazi Laconophilia====
Müller's emphasis on the northern origins and racial qualities of the Spartans later fed into the development of [[Nordicism]], the theory of the superiority of a North European [[Aryan race|Aryan]] [[master race]]. Later German writers regularly portrayed the Spartans as a model for the modern [[Prussian state]], which also emphasised military self-discipline. It was a short step from this to argue that the Prussians and the Spartans were originally of the same race. [[Frank H. Hankins]] summarises views of the American Nordicist [[Madison Grant]], writing in 1916:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sparta is pictured as particularly Nordic on account of the purity of its Dorian stock, while Athens is more of a mixture. Sparta thus exhibited the military efficiency, the thorough organization and the patriotic sacrifice of the individual to the state characteristic of Nordics everywhere and exemplified in modern Prussia, while Athens exhibited the intellectual brilliancy, the instability, the extreme individualism, the tendency to treason and conspiracy so characteristic of populations having a large [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean element]].&lt;ref&gt;Hankins, Frank, ''The Racial Basis of Civilization'', Knopff, 1926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These arguments were repeated by Nazi race theorists such as [[Hans F. K. Günther]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] particularly praised the Spartans, recommending in 1928 that Germany should imitate them by limiting "the number allowed to live". He added that "The Spartans were once capable of such a wise measure... The subjugation of 350,000 Helots by 6,000 Spartans was only possible because of the racial superiority of the Spartans." The Spartans had created "the first racialist state."&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;[https://www.un.org/holocaustremembrance/docs/paper3.shtml ''Hitler, Pol Pot, and Hutu Power: Distinguishing Themes of Genocidal Ideology''] Professor Ben Kiernan, Holocaust and the United Nations Discussion Paper&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Operation Barbarossa|the invasion of the]] [[USSR]], Hitler insisted that the Slavs should be treated like the helots under the Spartans: "They [the Spartans] came as conquerors, and they took everything", and so should the Germans. A Nazi officer specified that "the Germans would have to assume the position of the Spartiates, while... the Russians were the Helots."&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

===Contemporary Laconophilia===

{{see also|Sparta in popular culture}}

Modern Laconophilia has been present in popular culture, particularly with reference to the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], as portrayed in films such as ''[[The 300 Spartans]]''. It is also evident in the graphic novel ''[[300 (comics)|300]]'' and the [[300 (film)|film derived from it]].

In the modern world, the adjective "spartan" is used to imply simplicity, frugality, or avoidance of luxury and comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Webster Dictionary http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Spartan&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their reputation for physical prowess, the name "Spartans" has been adopted by teams in several sports. Michigan State University adopted "Spartans" as their collegiate team identity in 1925. In addition to the [[Michigan State Spartans]], other teams include the [[San Jose State Spartans]], [[Norfolk State Spartans]], and others. [[Association football|Soccer]] clubs include [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] ([[Czech Republic]]), [[Spartans F.C.|Spartans]] ([[Scotland]]), [[Ħamrun Spartans F.C.|Ħamrun Spartans]] ([[Malta]]) and [[Sparta Rotterdam]] ([[Netherlands]]).

'''Levon Marashlian''' ({{lang-hy|Լևոն Մարաշլյան}}; born December 18, 1948) is an American historian, professor, and scholar. His scholarly work has largely focused on Armenian, Russian, and Middle-Eastern history. He has participated in various debates, lectures, and conferences throughout the world. He is currently a professor of history at [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]].

==Life==
Of [[Armenians|Armenian]] descent, Marashlian was born in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] in 1948,&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|last=McGUINNESS|first=LIZ|title=Armenians Build for Future: Work to Maintain Culture, Restore Homeland|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=16 Sep 1981|page=oc_d1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relocated to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in 1956.&lt;ref name=glendale&gt;{{cite web|title=CV of Levon Marashlian|url=http://gcc.glendale.edu/marashlian/Webs/cvbrief.htm|publisher=Glendale Community College Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Vietnam War]], Marashlian served in the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] as an infantryman and grenadier from 1968&amp;ndash;69.&lt;ref name=glendale /&gt; He received his B.A. (1974) from the [[University of Illinois, Chicago]], and his M.A. (1978) and Ph.D. (1992) from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. His Ph.D. dissertation was titled, "The Armenian Question from Sèvres to Lausanne: Economics and Morality in American and British policies," which also appeared in Turkish translation in 2000 as ''Ermeni Sorunu Ve Türk-Amerikan İlişkileri''.

He was one of the founders of an Armenian Congress in 1981 which served Armenians throughout Southern California.&lt;ref name=latimes /&gt; One of the main aims of the congress is to have more Armenian-Americans become politically active.&lt;ref name=latimes /&gt;

On 15 May 1996, Marashlian provided testimony in support of [[Armenian Genocide recognition]] in a panel hearing of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref name=reporter&gt;{{cite news|title=Levon Marashlian Discusses Genocide/Denial in Various Public Forums in April and May|newspaper=Armenian Reporter International|date=24 May 1997|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that, "Those who today deny the Armenian Genocide are resorting to academically unsound revisionism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Record Volume 144, Number 148 (Friday, October 16, 1998)|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-10-16/html/CREC-1998-10-16-pt1-PgE2215.htm|publisher=Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marashlian was instrumental in bringing about the Armenian Genocide curriculum in California public schools when serving as an adviser to the California Department of Education Curriculum Committee in 1987.&lt;ref name=glendale /&gt;

He has lectured in many countries throughout the world, including [[Armenia]] and [[Karabakh]].&lt;ref name=richard&gt;{{cite book|last=Hovannisian|first=ed. by Richard G.|title=Remembrance and denial : the case of the Armenian genocide|date=1998|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit|isbn=081432777X|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kiBHkRtRmIIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Marashlian also participated in an academic debate in [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]] which dealt with the issue of the [[Armenian Genocide]] and Turkish-Armenian relations.&lt;ref name=asbarez&gt;{{cite news|title=Book on Armenian Question by Levon Marashlian Published in Turkish in Istanbul|url=http://asbarez.com/44406/book-on-armenian-question-by-levon-marashlian-published-in-turkish-in-istanbul/|newspaper=Asbarez|date=1 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marashlian's writings and opinions have been featured in several newspapers throughout the world including the ''[[Los Angeles Times]], [[Washington Times]], [[The Jewish Daily Forward]], [[Houston Chronicle]], [[Hurriyet Daily News]]'', and others.&lt;ref name=glendale /&gt;

==Life==
Adam was born in Grottkau, [[Duchy of Nysa|Nysa]], [[Habsburg Silesia]] (present-day [[Grodków]], [[Opole Voivodeship]]). He visited the college in ''Brieg'' [[Brzeg]], then studied on various academies with financial support of his benefactor [[Joachim von Berg]]. He was called in 1601 to teach as magister at the municipal school of Heidelberg, and later became co-rector and professor at the same institution.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Works==
[[File:Adam Melchior (1575-1622).jpg|thumb|''Vitae germanorum philosophorum'', 1615]]
His major achievement consisted of various literary historian biographies, which have been printed in [[Stuttgart]] and Heidelberg in five volumes: ''German Philosophers'' (incl. philologists, poets, mathematicians and physicists), ''German Theologians'', ''Foreign Theologians'', ''Jurists and Politicians'' and ''Medics''. The discussed German (with the exception of vol. three) personalities were sorted chronologically by the date of their death - these dates lie mostly between 1420 and 1620. His sources were biographic texts, personal records, funeral orations, letters and various academic records.

His ''Vitae Germanorum philosophorum'' (Lives of German philosophers) of 1615 contains&lt;ref&gt;CAMENA - Lateinische Texte der Frühen Neuzeit: [http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camenaref/adam/adam1/Adam_vitae_1.html#s142 HTML]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Internet Archive [https://archive.org/stream/vitaegermanorum00adamgoog#page/n152/mode/1up Scan]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the earliest [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] biographies.

It is mentioned that he discussed the [[Lutheran]] theologians in a deprecative manner, as he himself was [[Calvinist]].{{sfn|Kelchner|1875 }}

{{Indigenous rights}}
The '''Māori protest movement''' is a broad [[indigenous rights|indigenous-rights]] movement in [[Aotearoa]] [[New Zealand]]. While this movement has existed since Europeans first colonised New Zealand, its modern form emerged in the early 1970s and has focused on issues such as the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], Māori land rights, the [[Māori language]] and [[Māori culture|culture]], and [[racism]]. It has generally been allied with the [[Left-wing politics|left wing]] although it differs from the mainstream left in a number of ways. Most members of the movement have been [[Māori people|Māori]] but it has attracted some support from {{Lang|mi|[[pākehā]]}} (non-Māori) New Zealanders and internationally, particularly from other [[indigenous peoples]]. Notable successes of the movement include establishment of the [[Waitangi Tribunal]], the return of some Māori land, and the Māori language being made an official language of New Zealand. The movement is part of a broader [[Māori Renaissance]].

== Background ==
{{More sources|section|date=June 2018}}
There is a long history of Māori resistance to {{Lang|mi|[[pākehā]]}} (New Zealanders of European ancestry). Many Māori embraced most aspects of European culture while retaining many aspects of their own culture. From about 1500 Māori developed an increasing warlike culture that is believed to have its origins in climate cooling and other natural disasters which led to increasing fighting. The culmination of this was the enormous pre musket battle of Hingakaka near Te Awamutu about 1800 when 16,000 warriors took part and about 1600 died according to the Tainui historian Pei Te Hurinui-Jones. From 1805 to 1843, Māori tribes continued to fight amongst themselves during the musket wars. From the 1840s to the 1870s, various Māori chiefs and, later, parts of {{Lang|mi|[[iwi]]}} (tribes) fought against {{Lang|mi|pākehā}} settlers and later soldiers, in the 1863-4 [[New Zealand Land Wars]]. They also used petitions, court cases, deputations to the [[British monarch]] and New Zealand and British governments, passive resistance and [[boycotts]] to try to achieve their goal of a separate Maori political system . Some of this resistance came from religious cults such as [[Pai Marire]] and [[Ringatu]]. [[Prophet]]s such as Te Kooti, [[Rua Kenana]] and [[Te Whiti o Rongomai|Te Whiti]] are sometimes seen as early Māori activists. The [[Māori King]] movement was also an important focus of resistance, especially in the [[Taranaki]] and [[Waikato]] regions,although the Taranaki support for the king movement was limited with Wiremu Kingi, the dominant Taranaki chief, suddenly returning to Taranaki when government gunboats appeared in the Waikato River at Rangiriri . Some Māori also worked within {{Lang|mi|pākehā}} systems such as the [[New Zealand Parliament]] in order to resist [[land consumption|land loss]] and [[cultural imperialism]]. Ngata was one of the most important and influential Māori MP's who tried to combine the benefits of both cultures for Māori. He was forced to resign when he became involved in one of the biggest cases of mismanagement and maladministration which amounted to half a million pounds, ever seen in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Te Puea .M. King. Reed &gt;2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[World War II]], but especially from the 1950s, Māori moved from rural to urban areas in large numbers. Most {{Lang|mi|pākehā}} believed that New Zealand had ideal [[race relations]] and, although relations were good compared to many other countries, the harmony existed mostly because the mostly urban {{Lang|mi|pākehā}} and mostly rural Māori rarely came into contact. Māori urbanisation brought the differences between the cultures and the economic gaps between Māori and {{Lang|mi|pākehā}} into the open. In addition, many Māori had difficulty coping with modern urban society away from the stabilizing influence of their {{Lang|mi|[[whānau]]}} and {{Lang|mi|[[hapū]]}}. Some turned to alcohol or crime, and many felt lost and alone. Several new groups, most prominently the [[Māori Women's Welfare League]] and the [[New Zealand Māori Council]] emerged to help urban Māori and provide a unified voice for Māori. These groups were conservative by later standards but did criticise the government on numerous occasions.

The first significant Māori involvement in conventional protest came during controversy over the exclusion of Māori players from the 1960 [[All Blacks]] rugby tour of [[South Africa]]. However the protests tended to be organised and led by {{Lang|mi|pākehā}}.

==The Māori Affairs Amendment Act==
In the mid-1960s the [[Second National Government of New Zealand|National government]] proposed to make Maori land more ‘economic’ by encouraging its transfer to a {{Lang|mi|pākehā}} system of land ownership. The [[Maori Affairs Amendment Act]] 1967, as it became, generally allowed greater interference in Māori landholding, and was widely seen amongst Māori as a {{Lang|mi|pākehā}} "land grab". Under the Māori Affairs Act of 1957, land owners who had shares less than $50 were forced to sell their shares which became a problematic type of land alienation. This was intensified under the 1967 Act. The plans were strongly opposed by virtually every Maori group and organisation as the Act blatantly ignored the importance of Māori land being turangawaewae. Despite this, the Act was passed with only minor modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Richard S|title="Maori and the State: Crown-Māori relations in New Zealand/Aotearoa, 1950-2000" - The Maori Affairs Amendment Act|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-HilMaor-t1-body-d7-d4.html|website=New Zealand Electronic Text Collection|publisher=Victoria University of Wellington Library|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act is generally seen as the catalyst for the Māori protest movement, and the evidence certainly points to this. However the movement can also be seen as part of a wider [[civil rights movement]] which emerged across the world in the 1960s. The Act was abolished under the Māori Affairs Amendment Act of 1974, led by minister of Māori Affairs, Matiu Rata&lt;ref&gt;https://teara.govt.nz/en/te-tango-whenua-maori-land-alienation/page-9&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Sporting contact with South Africa==
[[File:NoMaorisNoTour.jpg|thumb|left|Early activism over the issue of sporting contacts with apartheid South Africa]]
{{main article|Rugby union and apartheid|1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand}}
New Zealand has a long history of sporting contact with [[South Africa]], especially through [[rugby union]]. Until the 1970s this resulted in discrimination against Māori players, since the [[apartheid]] political system in South Africa for most of the twentieth century did not allow people of different races to play sport together, and therefore South African officials requested that Māori players not be included in sides which toured their country. Despite some of New Zealand's best players being Māori, this was agreed to, and Māori were excluded from tours of South Africa. Some Māori always objected to this, but it did not become a major issue until 1960, when there were several public protests at Māori exclusion from that year's tour. The protest group [[Halt All Racist Tours]] was formed in 1969. Although this was an issue in which Māori were central, and Māori were involved in the protests, the anti-tour movement was dominated by {{Lang|mi|pākehā}}.

In 1973, a proposed tour of New Zealand by the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] (the South African rugby team) was cancelled. In 1976 the South African government relented and allowed a mixed-race [[All Black]] team to tour South Africa. However, by this time international opinion had turned against any sporting contact with South Africa, and New Zealand faced significant international pressure to cut ties. Despite this, in 1981 the Springboks toured New Zealand, sparking mass protests and [[civil disobedience]]. Although {{Lang|mi|pākehā}} continued to dominate the movement, Māori were prominent within it, and in [[Auckland]] formed the {{Lang|mi|[[patu]]}} squad in order to remain autonomous within the wider movement.

During and after the Tour, many Māori protesters questioned {{Lang|mi|pākehā}} protesters' commitment to racial equality, accusing them of focussing on racism in other countries while ignoring it within New Zealand. The majority of {{Lang|mi|pākehā}} protesters were not heavily involved in protest after the Tour ended, but a significant minority, including several anti-Tour groups, turned their attention to New Zealand race issues, particularly {{Lang|mi|pākehā}} prejudice and the Treaty of Waitangi.

==Waitangi Day protests==
The first act of the Māori protest movement was arguably the boycott of [[Waitangi Day]] by a handful of Māori elders in 1968 in protest over the Māori Affairs Amendment Act. A small protest was also held at parliament, and was received by [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] MP [[Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan]]. Although both were reported in the newspapers they made little impact. In 1971 the ceremonies were disrupted by the protest group [[Ngā Tamatoa]] (The Young Warriors) who chanted and performed {{Lang|mi|[[haka]]}} during speeches, and attempted to destroy the flag. Protest has been a feature of Waitangi Day ever since.

==Māori language and culture activism==
One of the early goals of the Māori protest movement was the promotion of [[Māori language]] (te reo Māori) and [[Māori culture|culture]]. Both of these had been generally ignored by the education system and New Zealand society in general, and schoolchildren were actively discouraged from speaking Māori in school. The [[1867 Native Schools Act]] decreed that English should be the only language used in the education of Māori children- this policy was later rigorously enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tetaurawhiri.govt.nz/english/issues_e/hist/index.shtml|title=- Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori|website=www.tetaurawhiri.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement was led by Māori MPs who saw the advantages of Maori becoming fluent in a dominant world language. Until Māori became largely urbanised after World War II, this did not seriously damage the language since most Māori spoke it in their rural communities. Urbanisation produced a generation of Māori who mostly grew up in non-Māori environments and were therefore less exposed to the language. In addition, many parents felt that it was much more important for their children to be fluent in English and made no attempts to pass on the language. 

As a result, many leaders of Māori protest were not fluent in Māori and felt that this was a major cultural loss. In the face of official indifference and sometimes hostility, Nga Tamatoa and other groups initiated a number of schemes for the promotion of the language. These included Māori Language Day, which later became [[Māori Language Week]]; a programme which trained fluent speakers as teachers; and {{Lang|mi|[[kohanga reo]]}}: Māori language pre-schools and later Māori kura or separate immersion schools at primary and secondary level. Later there were campaigns for a Māori share of the airwaves. These eventually resulted in the iwi radio stations and a [[Māori Television]] channel, all of which actively promote the language. 

In 1987 Te Reo was made an [[official language]] of New Zealand, with the passing of the [[Māori Language Act]]. Activists also campaigned to change the names of landmarks such as mountains back to their original Māori names, and to end the mispronunciation of Māori words, especially by newsreaders and other broadcasters. Many Māori cultural forms, such as carving, weaving and performing arts such as haka had gone into decline in the nineteenth century. From the early twentieth century [[Āpirana Ngata]] and others made efforts to revive them, for example setting up intertribal {{Lang|mi|[[kapa haka]]}} competitions and getting state funding for meeting houses. Māori activists continued this tradition, but their primary focus was on stopping the abuse of Māori cultural forms. 

The best known example of this was the 'haka party' incident. A group of [[University of Auckland]] engineering students had for many years performed a parody haka and paddled an imaginary {{Lang|mi|[[Waka (canoe)|waka]]}} around central Auckland as a [[capping stunt]]. Repeated requests to end the performance were ignored and eventually a group of Māori assaulted the students. Although the activists' actions were widely condemned by {{Lang|mi|[[pākehā]]}}, they were defended in court by Māori elders and were convicted but the students' stunt was not performed again. Most recent Māori protest in this sphere has been directed against non-New Zealand groups and businesses who use the Māori language and cultural forms—sometimes copyrighting them—without permission or understanding. Since it is internationally known, the [[haka of the All Blacks]] is particularly vulnerable to this treatment.

==The Treaty of Waitangi==
The [[Treaty of Waitangi]] has always been a major focus of Māori protest. It is often used to argue for particular aims, such as return of unjustly taken land, and the promotion of the Māori language.

===The Treaty to the mid 20th century===
{{main article|Treaty of Waitangi}}
The Treaty of Waitangi was an agreement, made in 1840, between the [[British Crown]] and various Māori chiefs. Although major differences between the Māori and English language versions of the Treaty make it difficult to ascertain exactly what was promised to who, the Treaty essentially gave the British the right to establish a governor in New Zealand, stated the rights of the chiefs to ownership of their lands and other properties, and gave Māori the rights of British citizens. Although the Treaty is generally seen as marking the beginning of the New Zealand nation, it was largely ignored for more than a century after its signing, and various legal judgements ruled it irrelevant to New Zealand law and government. Despite this, Māori frequently used it to argue that their rights were being denied.

===Campaign for ratification===
From about the mid nineteenth century, Māori campaigned for proper recognition of the Treaty, generally asking that it be [[ratified]] or otherwise made a part of New Zealand law. In the 1960s and the 1970s, Māori activists continued this campaign, sometimes making it a focus of their [[Waitangi Day]] protests. In 1975 the Treaty was given some recognition with the [[Treaty of Waitangi Act]]. This established the [[Waitangi Tribunal]], which was given the task to investigating contemporary breaches of the Treaty. However, since it was not able to investigate historical breaches, was underfunded, and generally unsympathetic to claimants, most Māori were disappointed by the Tribunal.

==="The Treaty is a Fraud"===

Possibly as a result to the failure of the Waitangi Tribunal to achieve much, many Māori activists in the early 1980s stopped asking for the Treaty to be honoured and instead argued that it was a fraudulent document. They argued that Māori had been tricked in 1840, that either they had never agreed to sign away their sovereignty or that {{Lang|mi|pākehā}} breaches of the Treaty had rendered it invalid. Since the Treaty was invalid, it was argued, the New Zealand government had no right to sovereignty over the country. This argument was broadly expressed in [[Donna Awatere]]'s book ''Māori Sovereignty''.

===Activism and the Tribunal===
In 1985 the Treaty of Waitangi Act was amended to allow the Tribunal to investigate historic breaches of the Treaty. It was also given more funding and its membership increased. In addition, the Treaty was mentioned in several pieces of legislation, and a number of court cases increased its importance. As a result, most Māori activists began to call once again for the Treaty to be honoured. Many protesters put their energies into Treaty claims and the management of settlements, but many also argued that the Tribunal was too underfunded and slow, and pointed out that because its recommendations were not binding the government could (and did) ignore it when it suited them. Some protesters continued to argue for Māori sovereignty, arguing that by negotiating with the Tribunal Māori were only perpetuating the illegal occupying government.

==Land==
{{main article|Aboriginal title in New Zealand}}
The longest-standing Māori grievances generally involve land. In the century after 1840 Māori lost possession of most of their land, although the amount lost varied significantly between [[iwi]]. In some cases the land was purchased legitimately from willing Māori sellers, but in many cases the transfer was legally and/or morally dubious. The best known cause of Māori land loss is the [[confiscation]] in the [[Waikato]] and [[Taranaki]] regions following the [[New Zealand Wars]]. Other causes included owners selling land without fully understanding the implications of the sale (especially in the early years of colonisation); groups selling land which did not belong to them; {{Lang|mi|pākehā}} traders enticing land owners into debt and then claiming the land as payment; the conducting of unrequested surveys which were then charged to the owners, and the unpaid bills from this used to justify taking the land; levying of unreasonable rates and confiscation following non-payment; the taking of land for [[public works]]; and simple fraud. Upon losing land, most iwi quickly embarked on campaigns to regain it but these were largely unsuccessful. Some iwi received token payments from the government but continued to agitate for the return of the land or, failing that, adequate compensation.

The return of lost land was a major focus of Māori activists, and generally united the older, more conservative generation with the younger 'protest' generation. Some of the best-known episodes of Māori protest centred on land, including:

===Bastion Point===
{{main article|Bastion Point}}
[[Bastion Point]] in [[Auckland]] was originally part of a large area of land owned by [[Ngāti Whātua|Ngāti Whatua]]. Between 1840 and 1960 nearly all of this was lost, leaving Ngāti Whatua with only the Point. In the 1970s the [[Third National Government of New Zealand|third National government]] proposed taking the land and developing it. Bastion Point was subsequently occupied in a protest which lasted from January 1977 to May 1978. The protesters were removed by the army and police, but there continued to be conflict over the land. When the Waitangi Tribunal was given the power to investigate historical grievances, this the [[Orakei]] claim covering the Bastion Point area was one of the first cases for investigation. The Tribunal found that Ngāti Whatua had been unjustly deprived of their ancestral land hence Bastion Point was returned to their ownership with compensation paid to the tribe by the Crown.

===Raglan Golf Course===
{{main article|Eva Rickard}}

During the Second World War, land in the [[Raglan, New Zealand|Raglan]] area was taken from its Māori owners for use as an airstrip. Following the end of the war, the land was not returned but instead leased to the Raglan Golf Club, who turned it into a golf course. This was particularly painful for the original owners as it contained burial grounds, one of which was turned into a [[bunker (golf)|bunker]]. A group of protesters led by [[Eva Rickard]] and assisted by [[Angeline Greensill]] occupied the land and also used legal means to have the land returned, a goal which was eventually achieved.

[[File:Whina Cooper in Hamilton.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Whina Cooper]] leads the Māori Land March through Hamilton in 1975]]

===1975 Land March===
In 1975 a large group (around 5000) of Māori and other New Zealanders, led by then 79-year-old [[Whina Cooper]], walked the length of the [[North Island]] to [[Wellington]] to protest against Māori land loss. Although the government at the time, the [[Third Labour Government of New Zealand|third Labour government]], had done more to address Māori grievances than nearly any prior government, protesters felt that much more needed to be done. Following the march, the protesters were divided over what to do next. Some, including [[Tame Iti]], remained in Wellington to occupy parliament grounds. A 1975 documentary from director Geoff Steven includes interviews with many of those on the march: [[Eva Rickard]], [[Tama Poata]] and [[Whina Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;This documentary can be viewed on [http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/te-matakite-o-aotearoa-1975 NZ On Screen] (requires [[Adobe Flash]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Footage of the television coverage of the march was included in the 1978 television adaptation of ''Death of the Land'' by Māori playwright [[Rowley Habib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/death-of-the-land-1978 |title=Death of the Land (video) |year=1978 |website= |publisher=NZOnScreen |accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resurgence of protest on land and Treaty issues in the 1990s==
A series of protests in the mid-1990s marked a new phase of activism on land and Treaty issues with action focused not only on the Government but also Māori conservatives who were seen as being complicit with the Government agenda. Symbolic acts included attacking Victorian statuary, the America's Cup and the lone pine on [[One Tree Hill, New Zealand|One Tree Hill]] and removing a Colin McCahon painting (subsequently returned) from the [[Lake Waikaremoana]] Visitor Centre. Rising protests at the [[Waitangi Day]] celebrations led the government to move the official observance to Government House in Wellington. Many protests were generated in response to the government's proposal to limit the monetary value of Treaty settlements to one billion dollars over 10 years, the so-called fiscal envelope. A series of hui (meetings) graphically illustrated the breadth and depth of Māori rejection of such a limitation in advance of the extent of claims being fully known. As a result, much of the policy package, especially the fiscal cap, was dropped. These protests included occupations of Whanganui's Moutoa Gardens and the Takahue school in Northland (leading to its destruction by fire).

===Fiscal Envelope===
The government unveils the fiscal envelope — its answer to settling Treaty of Waitangi grievances limiting the total amount that will be spent to one billion dollars. While early Tribunal recommendations mainly concerned a contemporary issue that could be revised or rectified by the government at the time, historical settlements raised more complex issues. The [[Office of Treaty Settlements]] was established in the Ministry of Justice to develop government policy on historical claims. In 1995, the government developed the "Crown Proposals for the Settlement of Treaty of Waitangi Claims"&lt;ref name="Crown Proposals"&gt;{{cite web | last = Office of Treaty Settlements| title = Crown Proposals for the Settlement of Treaty of Waitangi Claims | year = 1995 | url = http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AILR/1996/91.html | accessdate = 2006-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to attempt to address the issues. A key element of the proposals was the creation of a "[[fiscal envelope]]" of [[NZD|$]]1 billion for the settlement of all historical claims, an effective limit on what the Crown would pay out in settlements. The Crown held a series of consultation [[Hui (Māori assembly)|hui]] around the country, at which Māori vehemently rejected such a limitation in advance of the extent of claims being fully known.&lt;ref name="Gardiner"&gt;{{Cite book | surname=Gardiner| given=Wira| title=Return to Sender; what really happened at the fiscal envelope hui| publisher=Reed| place=[[Auckland]] | year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the fiscal envelope was subsequently dropped after the [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996 general election]]. Opposition to the policy was coordinated by [http://newzeal.blogspot.com/2007/02/tauni-sinclair-new-wave-radical.html Te Kawau Maro] an Auckland group who organised protests at the Government consultation Hui. Rising protests to the Fiscal Envelope at the [[Waitangi Day]] celebrations led the government to move the official observance to Government House in Wellington. Despite universal rejection of the 'Fiscal Envelope', Waikato-Tainui negotiators, accepted the Government Deal which became known as the [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements#Waikato Tainui Raupatu|Waikato Tainui Raupatu Settlement]]. Notable opposition to this deal was led by Maori leader [[Eva Rickard]].

===Pākaitore===
{{More citations needed|section|date=June 2018}}
For 79 days in 1995, people of the Whanganui tribes occupied historic Pākaitore (Moutoa Gardens), beside the river and within the city of Whanganui. This protest was resolved peaceably, and a tripartite agreement with government and local government has since been signed. At the heart of all this is the Whanganui tribes’ claim to the river, which is still seen as both an ancestor and a source of material and spiritual sustenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/whanganui-tribes/3/3/2|title=March through Whanganui|last=Reid|first=Phil|last2=Taonga|first2=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=www.teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We were forced to leave, and it shouldn't be lost on anybody that we upheld our dignity," protest leader [[Ken Mair]] told a press conference in Whanganui 18 May 1995 following the end of the occupation." In no way were we going to allow the state the opportunity to put the handcuffs on us and lock us away."{{Quote without source}}

The police were reported to have up to 1,000 reinforcements ready to evict the land occupants. Whanganuí Kaitoke prison had been gazetted as a "police jail" to enable its use as holding cells. The police eviction preparations were code-named "Operation Exodus". A week earlier, on 10 May, up to 70 police in riot gear had raided the land occupation in the middle of the night, claiming the protest had become a haven for "criminals and stolen property" and "drug users." Ten people were arrested on minor charges including "breach of the peace" and "assault." Throughout the occupation there has been a strict policy of no drugs or alcohol on the site.

Protest leaders denounced the raid as a dress rehearsal for their forced eviction and an attempt to provoke, intimidate, and discredit the land occupants. Throughout the 79-day occupation, the land protesters faced almost nightly harassment and racist abuse by the police. The decision to end the Māori occupation of Moutoa Gardens was debated by participants at a three-hour meeting 17 May 1995. At 3:45 the next morning the occupants gathered and began dismantling tents and buildings and the surrounding fence. Bonfires burned across the site. At 4:50&amp;nbsp;a.m., the same time they had entered the gardens 79 days earlier, the protesters began their march to a meeting place several miles away.

Over the next few days, a team continued to dismantle the meeting house and other buildings that had been erected during the occupation. "Every step of the way has been worthwhile as far as we are concerned," [[Niko Tangaroa]] told the 18 May press conference in Wanganui. "Pakaitore is our land. It will remain our land, and we will continue to assert that right irrespective of the courts." The protest leaders vowed to continue their fight, including through further land occupations. "As long as the Crown [government] buries its head in the sand and pretends that issues of sovereignty and our land grievances are going to go away—we are going to stand up and fight for what is rightfully ours," [[Ken Mair]] declared.

===Takahue===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
The Whanganui occupation of Pakaitore inspired a group of Māori from Takahue a small Northland settlement to occupy the local schoolhouse. The several dozen protesters who have occupied the school since then are demanded that title to the land on which the school stands be returned to them. The {{convert|6|acre|m2}} they claimed were part of {{convert|4500|acre|km2}} purchased by the government in 1875, in a transaction the protesters, descendants of the original owners, regard as invalid. The school has been closed since the mid-1980s and used as an army training camp and for community activities since then. Bill Perry, a spokesperson for the protesters, explained to reporters who visited the occupation on 22 April 1995 that the land they are claiming has been set aside in a government controlled Landbank together with other property in the region. This Landbank allegedly protects lands currently subject to claims under the Waitangi Tribunal from sale pending settlement of the claims. The occupation ended with mass arrests and the burning of the school.

===Huntly===
Another occupation inspired by Pakaitore began on 26 April 1995 in Huntly, a coal mining town south of Auckland. The block of land sits atop a hill overlooking the town, in full view of the mine entrance with its coal conveyor leading to a power station. Protesters told reporters who visited the occupation 29 April that the land is part of {{convert|1200000|acre|km2}} confiscated by the government 132 years ago from the Tainui tribe. It is now owned by [[Solid Energy]], previously Coalcorp, a state-owned enterprise.

Those occupying the land are demanding its return to Ngāti Whawhakia, the local Māori sub-tribe. The claim includes coal and mineral rights. Robert Tukiri, chairman of Ngāti Whawhakia Trust and spokesperson for the occupation said, "We have got our backs to the wall. There is a housing shortage. We need to have houses." Tukiri opposed a NZ$170 million (NZ$1=US$0.67) deal between the government and the Tainui Maori Trust Board due to be signed 22 May as final settlement for the government's land seizures last century. The agreement will turn over {{convert|86000|acre|km2}} of state-owned land to the trust board and NZ$65 million for further purchases of private land. "The Tainui Maori Trust Board stands to become the biggest landlord around, while 80 percent of our tribe rents their homes," Tukiri commented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themilitant.com/1995/5919/5919_36.html|title=The Militant - 5/15/95 -- New Zealand Maoris Occupy Land In Coal-Mining District|website=www.themilitant.com|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreshore and Seabed==
[[File:Hikoi-foreshore.jpg|thumb|right|The foreshore and seabed hikoi outside [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]]]]
{{main article|New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy}}
In 2003 the [[New Zealand Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] ruled that Māori could seek customary title to areas of the New Zealand [[foreshore]] and [[seabed]], overturning assumptions that such land automatically belonged to the Crown. The ruling alarmed many {{Lang|mi|pākehā}}, and the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour government]] proposed legislation removing the right to seek ownership of the foreshore and seabed. This angered many Māori who saw it as confiscation of land. [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] MP [[Tariana Turia]] was so incensed by the legislation that she eventually left the party and formed the [[Māori Party]]. In May 2004 a {{Lang|mi|[[hīkoi]]}} (march) from [[Northland Region|Northland]] to Wellington, modeled on the 1975 land march but in vehicles, was held, attracting thousands of participants. Despite this, the legislation was passed later that year.

==Te Mana Motuhake o Tuhoe==
Te Mana Motuhake o Tuhoe is a group which includes the Tuhoe leader [[Tame Iti]]. The group has held numerous campaigns highlighting the rights of the [[Tuhoe]] people. The ideology of the group is based on self-government as a base principle of democracy and that Tuhoe has the democratic right to self-government. Tuhoe were not signatories of the Treaty of Waitangi, and have always maintained a right to uphold uniquely Tuhoe values, culture, language and identity within their homelands.

===Te Urupatu===
On 16 January 2005 during a {{Lang|mi|[[pōwhiri]]}} (or greeting ceremony) which formed part of a [[Waitangi Tribunal]] hearing, Iti fired a shotgun into a [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand flag]] in close proximity to a large number of people, which he explained was an attempt to recreate the 1860s [[East Cape War]]: "We wanted them to feel the heat and smoke, and Tūhoe outrage and disgust at the way we have been treated for 200 years".{{Quote without source}} The incident was filmed by television crews but initially ignored by police. The matter was however raised in parliament, one opposition [[Member of parliament|MP]] asking "why Tāme Iti can brandish a firearm and gloat about how he got away with threatening judges on the Waitangi Tribunal, without immediate arrest and prosecution".{{Quote without source}}

The police subsequently charged Iti with discharging a firearm in a public place. His trial occurred in June 2006. Tāme Iti elected to give evidence in Māori (his native language), stating that he was following the Tūhoe custom of making noise with [[totara]] poles. Tūhoe Rangatira stated Iti had been disciplined by the tribe and protocol clarified to say discharge of a weapon in anger was always inappropriate (but stated that it was appropriate when honouring dead warriors, (in a manner culturally equivalent to the firing of a volley over a grave within Western cultures)). Judge Chris McGuire said "It was designed to intimidate unnecessarily and shock. It was a stunt, it was unlawful".{{Quote without source}}

Judge McGuire convicted Iti on both charges and fined him. Iti attempted to sell the flag he shot on the [[TradeMe]] auction site to pay the fine and his legal costs, but the sale—a violation of proceeds of crime legislation—was withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tumeke.org|title=Domain Default page|website=www.tumeke.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iti lodged an appeal, in which his lawyer, [[Annette Sykes]], argued that Crown Law did not stretch to the ceremonial area in front of a Marae's Wharenui. On 4 April 2007, the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand]] overturned his convictions for unlawfully possessing a firearm. While recognising that events occurred in "a unique setting", the court did not agree with Sykes' submission about Crown law. However Justices Hammond, O'Regan and Wilson found that his prosecutors failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Iti's actions caused "requisite harm", under Section 51 of the Arms Act. The Court of Appeal described Iti's protest as "a foolhardy enterprise" and warned him not to attempt anything similar again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Anti-terror raids===
{{main article|2007 New Zealand anti-terror raids}}
On Monday, 15 October 2007, several police raids were conducted across New Zealand in relation to the discovery of an alleged paramilitary training camp deep in the [[Te Urewera|Urewera]] mountain range near the town of [[Ruatoki]] in the eastern [[Bay of Plenty]].
[[File:Ngāi Tūhoe.png|thumb|right|250px|Approximate area of the [[Te Urewera|Urewera]] mountain range.]]

About 300 [[New Zealand Police|police]], including members of the [[Armed Offenders Squad|Armed Offenders]] and anti-terror squads, were involved in the raids&lt;ref name=tv3-1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tv3.co.nz/Policefoilparamilitaryplotnapalmbombtested/tabid/209/articleID/36974/Default.aspx|title=Police foil paramilitary plot - napalm bomb tested|work=[[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]]|date=15 October 2007|accessdate=16 October 2007}}([https://www.webcitation.org/5SkdEBKU8 cached 21 October 2007])&lt;/ref&gt; in which four [[guns]] and 230 rounds of [[ammunition]] were seized and 17 people arrested, all but one of them charged with firearms offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Terror raids - charges linked to just 4 guns | work = The New Zealand Herald | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10476635 | date = 17 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to police, the raids were a culmination of more than a year of surveillance that uncovered and monitored the training camps. Search warrants were executed under the Summary Proceedings Act to search for evidence relating to potential breaches of the [[Terrorism Suppression Act 2002|Terrorism Suppression Act]] and the [[Arms Act (New Zealand)|Arms Act]].

On 29 October, police referred evidence gathered during the raids to the [[Solicitor-General of New Zealand|Solicitor-General]] to consider whether charges should be laid under the Terrorism Suppression Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title  = Solicitor-General to decide whether to lay terrorism charges | work = Radio New Zealand | url = http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/latest/200710291628/solicitor-general_to_decide_whether_to_lay_terrorism_charges | date = 29 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorisation for prosecutions under the Act is given by the Attorney-General though he has delegated this responsibility to Solicitor-General [[David Collins (New Zealand Solicitor-General)|David Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Terror raid evidence with Solicitor-General | work = The New Zealand Herald | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10472766 | date = 29 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 November the Solicitor-General declined to press charges under the Terrorism Suppression Act, because of inadequacies of the legislation.&lt;ref name=nocharges&gt;{{cite web | title = Terror legislation too complex - Collins | work = Stuff.co.nz | url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/4266436a25364.html | date = 9 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]], one of the reasons police tried to lay charges under anti-terror legislation was because they could not use telephone interception evidence in prosecutions under the Arms Act.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10475675"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10475675&amp;ref=rss |title=Wider phone tapping considered |author=Claire Trevett and Elizabeth Binning |date=13 November 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign to fly the ''Tino Rangatiratanga'' flag==

The official recognition of the ''[[Tino Rangatiratanga]]'' flag was a campaign of indigenous-rights-advocacy group Te Ata Tino Toa. The group applied for permission for the Tino Rangatiratanga flag to be flown on the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] on Waitangi Day. After considerable debate in the public arena the group adopted various tactics to raise awareness of the issues, including lobbying [[Transit New Zealand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/in050208.pdf|title=Request for Support (Transit NZ and the Maori flag)|last=Jackson|first=Bryan|date=5 February 2008|website=converge.org.nz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0812/S00242.htm|title=Letter To Dr Sharples About Flying The Maori Flag {{!}} Scoop News|website=www.scoop.co.nz|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; submissions to the [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|Human Rights Commission]] and holding an annual "Fly the Flag" competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0702/S00080.htm|title=Images: The Maori Flag Flies On Waitangi Day {{!}} Scoop News|website=www.scoop.co.nz|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to more [[Direct action|direct protest actions]] including [[bungee jumping]] off and traffic-jamming the Harbour Bridge, as well as flying the flag from the bridge. Organisers of the campaign included Tia Taurere, Gareth Seymour and Teanau Tuiono.{{Cn|date=June 2018}}

===Sanctioned uses of the Tino Rangatiratanga Flag===

On 14 December 2009 Prime Minister [[John Key]] and Māori Affairs Minister [[Pita Sharples]] announced that the Maori Tino Rangatiratanga flag has been chosen to fly from the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] and other official buildings (such as [[Premier House]]) on [[Waitangi Day]]. The announcement followed a Māori Party-led promotion and series of [[hikoi]] on which Māori flag should fly from the bridge and 1,200 submissions, with 80 per cent of participants in favour of Tino Rangatiratanga flag as the preferred Māori flag.&lt;ref name="tr_announce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3159495/Maori-flag-to-fly-on-Waitangi-Day|author=Colin Espiner|publisher=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|title=Maori flag to fly on Waitangi Day |date=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ngai Tahu reject the flag saying the "flag has been nothing but trouble".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3295467/Ngai-Tahu-reject-flag-as-trouble|title=Ngai Tahu reject flag as 'trouble'|website=Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key said the Māori flag would not replace the New Zealand flag but would fly alongside it to recognise the partnership the Crown and Māori entered into when signing the Treaty of Waitangi. "No changes are being made to the status of the New Zealand flag," Mr Key said.

Sharples said the Māori flag was a simple way to recognise the status of Māori as [[tangata whenua]]. "However, the New Zealand flag remains the symbol of our nation, and there is no intention to change this, nor to diminish the status of our national flag."

The Ministry of Culture and Heritage published guidelines describing the appropriate way to fly the Māori flag in relation to the New Zealand flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/nzflag/maori-flag.html|title=Flags {{!}} Ministry for Culture and Heritage|website=www.mch.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saqr Abu Fakhr''' ({{lang|ar|صقر أبو فخر}}) is an Arab writer living in [[Lebanon]]. He is a former editor at majallat al-dirasat al-filastiniyya (مجلة الدراسات الفلسطينية),the Arabic-language journal of the Institute for Palestine Studies (مؤسسة الدراسات الفلسطينية). He is a researcher and author specialized in [[Arab]] Affairs, with special focus on [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] Affairs. He first started writing in 1973, and his writings have been published in [[As-Safir]] newspaper, the journal ''[[Arab Studies]]'' and the journal ''[[Palestinian Affairs]]''.

Saqr has held a variety of editorial and research positions; he was appointed as the Editorial Secretary for the "Palestine Supplement"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=الملحق الفلسطيني|url=http://palestine.assafir.com/index.asp|publisher=Assafir}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Assafir, a leading Arabic daily newspaper. Since 1981, he was the editor or the assistant managing editor for a number of journals and research institutes, namely the [[PLO Planning Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=مركز التخطيط الفلسطيني|url=http://www.oppc.pna.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Institute for Palestine Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=مؤسسة الدراسات الفلسطينية|url=http://www.palestine-studies.org/ar_index.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written extensively about Palestinian history, culture, and the situation of refugees in Lebanon. His writings have been translated to various languages (such as Turkish, Kurdish, [[Persian language|Persian]], French and English). He is a member of a number of professional associations (such as the General Union of Palestinian Writers and Journalists, the Information Committee in the International Council for the Palestinians in the Diaspora -Geneva) and other advocacy societies (such the Arab National Congress, the Right of return, Aidoun [We will return]). Additionally, after discovering a collection of unknown short stories by the Palestinian writer [[Samira Azzam]], he edited and published them. Abu Fakher obtained his BA in Economics in 1976.

He is the author of the article "''Seven Prejudices about the Jews''" published in [[Al-Hayat newspaper]] (November 12, 13, 14 1997). He criticized ignorance, narrow-mindedness, and denial prevalent in the Arab world, and described Arab thought regarding the Jews and the history of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] as full of misconceptions and myths.

Saqr examined and refuted seven common subjects of Arab myths about Israel:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw97-8/arab.html Tel Aviv University Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

* That [[Judaism]] is not a [[monotheistic]] religion.
* That the [[blood libel]] and the [[matzah]] of Zion stories are true.
* That the Israeli flag represents the goal of the borders of Israel be from the [[Greater Israel|Nile to the Euphrates]]
* That ''The [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' is true.
* That there is a Zionist [[Zionist Occupation Government|Jewish conspiracy]] and that Jews wield [[Jewish conspiracy#Jewish world domination|hidden power]]
* That there is a unique [[Ashkenazi intelligence|Jewish ingenuity]].
* That there is an all-powerful Zionist "[[Jewish lobby]]" in the United States.

Saker Abu Fakhr is currently a Researcher and Editor at the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies.

'''Tacitean studies''', centred on the work of [[Tacitus]] ({{circa|56}} &amp;ndash; {{circa|120 AD}}) the [[Ancient Roman]] historian, constitute an area of scholarship extending beyond the field of history. The work has traditionally been read for its moral instruction, its narrative, and its inimitable prose style; Tacitus has been (and still is) most influential as a political theorist, outside the field of history.{{ref|remembrance}} The political lessons taken from his work fall roughly into two camps (as identified by [[Giuseppe Toffanin]]): the "red Tacitists", who used him to support [[republicanism|republican]] ideals, and the "black Tacitists", those who read his accounts as a lesson in [[Machiavellian]] ''[[Realpolitik]]''.{{ref|redandblack}}

Though his work is the most reliable source for the history of his era, its factual accuracy is occasionally questioned: the ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' are based in part on secondary sources of unknown reliability, and there are some obvious minor mistakes (for instance confusing the two daughters of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Octavia Minor]], both named Antonia). The ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'', written from primary documents and personal knowledge of the Flavian period, is thought to be more accurate, though Tacitus's hatred of Domitian seemingly colored its tone and interpretations.

==Antiquity and Middle Ages==
Tacitus's contemporaries were well-acquainted with his work; [[Pliny the Younger]], one of his first admirers, congratulated him for his better-than-usual precision and predicted that his ''Histories'' would be immortal: only a third of his known work has survived and then through a very tenuous textual tradition; we depend on a single manuscript for books I-VI of the ''Annales'' and on another one for the other surviving half (books XI-XVI) and for the five books extant of the ''Historiae''.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Michael, ''Latin Literature: an anthology'', Penguin Classics, London, 1978 p.378f&lt;/ref&gt; His books were clearly used by 2nd-early 3rd century historians such as [[Cassius Dio]]'s report on Agricola's exploration of Britain, and [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]] may have borrowed from his account of the [[Great Jewish Revolt]].{{ref|dio}} His difficult historical methods and elliptic literary style, however, went unimitated except by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], who consciously set out to write a continuation of his works.{{ref|ammianus}} His popularity waned with time: his unfavorable portrayals of the early emperors could not have earned him favor with Rome's increasingly autocratic rulers, and his obvious contempt for [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] (both troublesome foreign cults in the eyes of a 1st-century Roman aristocrat) made him unpopular among the early [[Church Fathers]].{{ref|patres}} The 3rd century writer [[Tertullian]], for example, blames him (incorrectly&amp;mdash;see [[history of anti-Semitism]]) for originating the story that the Jews worshipped a donkey's head in the [[Holy of Holies]] and calls him "''ille mendaciorum loquacissimus''", 'the most loquacious of liars'.{{ref|tertullian}}

[[Image:Einhard.jpg|thumb|left|Monks like [[Einhard]] were the only readers of Tacitus for most of the [[Middle Ages]].]]
In the 4th century there are scattered references to his life and work. Flavius Vopiscus, one of the supposed ''[[Augustan History|Scriptores Historiae Augustae]]'', mentions him twice ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Aurelian/1*.html#2 ''Aurelian'' 2.1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Probus*.html#2.7 ''Probus'' 2.7.]) and names him among the ''disertissimos viros'', the most eloquent men. Ammianus Marcellinus, as mentioned, started his history where Tacitus had finished. [[Jerome]] knew of him, and [[Sulpicius Severus]] either used his [[Annales (Tacitus)|Annales]] as a source for passages on [[Nero]]{{ref|4thcentury}} or, according to Aurthur Drews, the passage in [[Sulpicius Severus]]'s Chronicles later found its way into [[Annales (Tacitus)|Annales]]. By the 5th century only a few authors seem aware of him: [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], who admires him, and [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], who alternately derides him as a fool and borrows passages (including many that are otherwise lost) from his works.{{ref|5thcentury}} [[Cassiodorus]] and his disciple [[Jordanes]] (middle of the 6th century) make the last known antique references; Cassiodorus draws on parts of the ''Germania'' and Jordanes cites the ''Agricola'', but both know the author only as ''Cornelius''.{{ref|Cassiodorus}}

After Jordanes, Tacitus disappeared from literature for the better part of two centuries, and only four certain references appear until 1360. Two come from [[Franks|Frankish]] monks of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]: the ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'' from the [[Fulda|monastery of Fulda]] used Tacitus's ''Annals'', and [[Rudolf of Fulda]] borrowed from the ''Germania'' for his ''Translatio Sancti Alexandri''.{{ref|fulda}} Some of Tacitus's works were known at [[Monte Cassino]] by 1100, where the other two certain references appear: [[Peter the Deacon]]'s ''Vita Sancti Severi'' used the ''Agricola'', and [[Paulinus Venetus]], [[Bishop of Pozzuoli]], plagiarized passages from the ''Annals'' in his ''[[mappa mundi]]''.{{ref|montecassino}} Hints and reminiscences of Tacitus appear in French and English literature, as well as German and Italian, from the 12th to the 14th century, but none of them are at all certain.{{ref|hints}} It was not until [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] brought the manuscript of the ''Annals'' 11-16 and the ''Histories'' out of Monte Cassino to [[Florence]], in the 1360s or 1370s, that Tacitus began to regain some of his old literary importance. His Annals survive only in single copies of two halves of the works, one from Fulda and one from Cassino.

==Italian Renaissance==
[[Image:Leonardo Bruni 2.jpg|thumb|left|Leonardo Bruni was the first to use Tacitus as a source for political philosophy.]]
Boccaccio's efforts brought the works of Tacitus back into public circulation&amp;mdash;where they were largely passed over by the [[Renaissance humanism|Humanists]] of the 14th and 15th centuries, who preferred the smooth style of Cicero and the patriotic history of [[Livy]], who was by far their favorite historian.{{ref|livy}} The first to read his works&amp;mdash;they were four: Boccacio, Benvenuto Rambaldi, Domenico Bandini, and [[Coluccio Salutati]]&amp;mdash;read them solely for their historical information and their literary style. On the merits of these they were divided.{{ref|humanists}} Bandini called him "[a] most eloquent orator and historian",{{ref|bandini}} while Salutati commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For what shall I say about Cornelius Tacitus? Although a very learned man, he wasn't able to equal those closest [to Cicero]. But he was even way behind Livy&amp;mdash;whom he proposed to follow&amp;mdash;not only in historical series but in imitation of eloquence.{{ref|salutati}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The use of Tacitus as a source for [[political philosophy]], however, began in this era, triggered by the [[Florentine Republic]]'s struggle against the imperial ambitions of [[Giangaleazzo Visconti]]. Visconti's death from an illness did more than lift his siege of Florence; it sparked [[Leonardo Bruni]] to write his ''Panegyric to the City of Florence'' (c. 1403), in which he quoted Tacitus (''Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+1.1 1.1]) to buttress his [[republicanism|republican]] theory that monarchy was inimical to virtue, nobility, and (especially) genius.{{ref|bruni}} The inspiration was novel&amp;mdash;Bruni had probably learned of Tacitus from Salutati. The thesis likewise: Tacitus himself had acknowledged that the good emperors Nerva and Trajan posed no threat to his endeavors.{{ref|bruni_thesis}}

Tacitus, and the theory which Bruni based on him, played a vital role in the spirited debate between the republicans of Florence and the proponents of monarchy and aristocracy elsewhere. [[Guarino da Verona]], in 1435, used the literary flowering of [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus's]] era&amp;mdash;which included Livy, [[Horace]], [[Virgil]], and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]&amp;mdash;to argue against Bruni's contention; [[Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini]] countered with the argument that all the authors had been born during the waning years of the [[Roman Republic]]. [[Pietro Candido Decembrio|Pier Candido Decembrio]], a [[Milan]]ese courtier, addressed the same argument to Bruni in the following year, which Bruni did not bother to rebut, the best counterargument having been made already.{{ref|15thc_political}} The rule of [[Cosimo de Medici]], however, saw the end of these political readings of Tacitus, though his works were now readily available in the public library of Florence. Instead, scholars such as [[Leone Battista Alberti]] and [[Flavio Biondo]] used him in academic works on the history and architecture of 1st century Rome. His laconic style and bleak outlook remained unpopular.{{ref|15thc_academic}}

[[Image:Santi di Tito - Niccolo Machiavelli's portrait headcrop.jpg|thumb|right|Niccolò Machiavelli occasionally resembles Tacitus in his pessimistic realism, but he himself preferred Livy.]]
At the beginning of the 15th century, following the expulsion of the [[Medici]] from Florence, their return, and the [[History of Italy during foreign domination and the unification|foreign invasions of Italy]], Tacitus returned to prominence among the theorists of [[classical republicanism]]. [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] was the first to revive him, but not (at first) in the republican model which Bruni and others had followed. One quotation from the ''Annals'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+13.19 13.19]) appears in ''[[The Prince]]'' (ch. [http://www.constitution.org/mac/prince13.htm 13]), advising the ruler that "it has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength".{{ref|principe}} The idealized Prince bears some resemblance to Tacitus's Tiberius; a few (most notably Giuseppe Toffanin) have argued that Machiavelli had made more use of Tacitus than he let on. In fact, though, Machiavelli had probably not read the first books of the ''Annals'' at that time&amp;mdash;they were published after ''The Prince''.{{ref|toffanin}}

In his overtly republican ''[[Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio|Discourses on the First Ten Books of Livy]]'', Machiavelli returned to Bruni's republican perspective on Tacitus. Four overt references appear in the work. Chapter [http://www.constitution.org/mac/disclivy1.htm#1:10 1.10] follows Tacitus (''Histories'' 1.1), and Bruni, on the chilling effects of monarchy. Chapter [http://www.constitution.org/mac/disclivy1.htm#1:29 1.29] quotes the ''Histories'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Hist.+4.3 4.3]) on the burden of gratitude and the pleasure of revenge. Chapter [http://www.constitution.org/mac/disclivy3.htm#3:06 3.6] quotes Tacitus&lt;!--not sure exactly which passage--&gt;: "men have to honor things past but obey the present, and ought to desire good Princes, but tolerate the ones they have". [http://www.constitution.org/mac/disclivy3.htm#3:19 3.19] twists a line from Tacitus ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+3.55 3.55]) into something very similar to Machiavelli's famous maxim that it is better for a prince to be feared than loved. (The original made a very different point: that respect for the Emperor and a desire to conform, not fear and punishment, kept certain senators in line.) Many covert references appear: Machiavelli generally follows Tacitus's decidedly negative slant on the history of Rome under the [[Roman Emperor|Emperors]].{{ref|Machiavelli}}

Machiavelli had read Tacitus for instruction on [[form of government|forms of government]], republican as well as autocratic, but after his books were placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'', writers on political philosophy (the so-called "black Tacitists"&amp;mdash;see above) frequently used the Roman as a stand-in for the Florentine (that is the ''Machiavellian'' part of the Florentine), and the Emperor Tiberius as a mask for the ideal Prince. So, writers like [[Francesco Guicciardini]] considered Tacitus' work to be an instruction on how to build a despotic state. Following that line of thought (Catholics in appearance reading ''Tacitus'' instead of Machiavelli's still forbidden ''Prince''), the thinkers of the [[Counter-Reformation]] and the age of absolute monarchies used his works as a set of rules and principles for political action.
Girolamo Cardano in his 1562 book ''Encomium Neronis'' describes Tacitus as a scoundrel of the worst kind, belonging to the rich senatorial class and always taking their side against the conmmon people.

==Enlightenment and revolutions==
Early theoreticians of ''[[raison d'état]]'' used Tacitus to defend an ideal of Imperial rule. Other readers used him to construct a method for living under a despotic state, avoiding both servility and useless opposition. [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], for example, used Tacitus' works, in his apology for Seneca, to justify the collaboration of philosophers with the sovereign.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Tacitus was mostly admired for his opposition to despotism. In literature, some great tragedians such as [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], [[Jean Racine]] and [[Vittorio Alfieri|Alfieri]], took inspirations from Tacitus for their dramatic characters.

[[Edward Gibbon]] was strongly influenced by Tacitus' historical style in his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'',

The [[French Revolution]]aries, for whom Tacitus had been a central part of their early education,
made much use of his criticisms of tyranny and love of the [[republic]]&amp;mdash;he is one of the authors most often quoted (behind Cicero, Horace, and Plutarch) by the members of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National]] and [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assemblies]] and by revolutionary authors such as [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]]. Later, during the [[Reign of Terror]], [[Camille Desmoulins]] and the writers of the ''[[Actes des apôtres]]'' used him to denounce the excesses of the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]].{{ref|frevolution}}

[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], on the other hand, attacked his works furiously, both for style and contents. This would-be founder of an Imperial dynasty, praised by amongst others [[Goethe]] for his insight in literature, knew the danger that Tacitus's histories might pose to one who wished to go around grabbing for power. [[François-René de Chateaubriand|François de Chateaubriand]], for one, had already compared the new Emperor of the French to the worst emperors of Rome, warning that a new Tacitus would someday do for Napoleon what Tacitus had done for Nero. The Emperor's reaction was vicious: to Goethe and [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]] he complained that "[[Tacitus]] finds criminal intention in the simplest acts; he makes complete scoundrels out of all the emperors to make us admire his genius in exposing them". To others he swore that Tacitus, ''ce [[pamphleteer|pamphlétaire]]'', had "slandered the emperors" whom, he averred, the Roman people had loved.{{ref|Napoleon}}

==Twentieth century==
By the 20th century authenticity of the remaining texts ascribed to Tacitus was generally acknowledged, apart from some difference of opinion about the ''[[dialogus de oratoribus|Dialogus]]''. Tacitus became a stock part of any education in classical literature&amp;nbsp;– usually, however, only after the study of Caesar, Livy, Cicero, etc., while Tacitus' style requires a greater understanding of the Latin language, and is perceived as less "classical" than the authors of the Augustan age.

A remarkable feat was accomplished by [[Robert Graves]]: the major gap of text that had gone lost of the ''Annals'' regarded parts of the end of [[Tiberius]]' reign, the whole of [[Caligula]]'s reign, and the major part of [[Claudius]]' reign (the remaining part of Tacitus' manuscript only took up again at this Emperor's death, for the transition to the reign of [[Nero]]). Robert Graves' 1934 ''[[I, Claudius]]'', and the ensuing ''[[Claudius the God]]'' (1935) filled the gap perfectly: all the missing parts of the Annals, up to the latter part of the reign of Claudius himself, were covered by a coherent story. Of course part of it can be considered "mockumentary" in the ''[[Augustan History]]'' tradition (for example how Claudius really felt about [[republicanism]], heavily elaborated by Graves sometimes based on "reconstructed" historical documents, will probably never be really established). Graves borrowed much from Tacitus' style: apart from the "directness" of an Emperor pictured to write down his ''memoires'' for private use (linked to the "lost testament of Claudius" mentioned in Tacitus' ''Annals''), the treatment is also on a year-by-year basis, with digressions not unlike Tacitus' "moralising" digressions, so that in the introduction of the second of these two volumes Graves saw fit to defend himself as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some reviewers of ''I, Claudius'', the prefatory volume to ''Claudius the God'', suggested that in writing it I had merely consulted Tacitus's ''Annals'' and [[Suetonius]]'s ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Twelve Caesars]]'', run them together, and expanded the result with my own "vigorous fancy." This was not so; nor is it the case here. Among the Classical writers who have been borrowed from in the composition of ''Claudius the God'' are Tacitus, Cassius Dio, Suetonius, [[Pliny (disambiguation)|Pliny]]&lt;!--ambiguity is deliberate, please don't fix it--&gt;, [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], [[Valerius Maximus]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], [[Frontinus]], [[Strabo]], [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Columella]], [[Plutarch]], [[Josephus]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], [[John Xiphilinus|Xiphilinus]], [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Petronius]], [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]], [[Philo]], [[Celsus]], the authors of the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' and of the pseudo-gospels of [[Nicodemus]] and [[James the Just|St. James]], and Claudius himself in his surviving letters and speeches.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
...no doubt, Tacitus remains the first author mentioned in this list.

Graves' work reflected back on the perception of Tacitus' work: Graves curbed the "slandering of Emperors" by portraying Claudius as a good-humoured emperor, at heart a ''republican'' (...probably stretching some of Claudius' ''naivety'' to accomplish that effect) - resulting in the perception that if the "Claudius" part of Tacitus' annals had survived it probably wouldn't have been all slander towards the emperors of the 1st century.{{ref|series}} The more explicit defence of republicanism in Graves' work (that is: ''much more'' explicit than in Tacitus' work) also made any further direct defense of ''black Tacitism'' quite impossible (as far as Napoleon, by ''not'' advocating a ''black Tacitism'' line of thought hadn't already made such interpretation obsolete).

By the end of 20th century, however, a sort of ''inverted red tacitism'' (as the new variant of black tacitism could be called) appeared, for example in publications like [[#References|Woodman's ''Tacitus reviewed'']]: the new theories described the emperors of the [[principate]] no longer as ''[[monarch]]s'' ruling as [[Autocracy|autocrat]]s, but as "magistrates" in essence defending a "republican" form of government (which might excuse some of their rash actions), very much in line with Graves' lenient posture regarding crimes committed under the rule of ''princeps'' Claudius (for instance the putting aside of the [[Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus|elder L. Silanus]], showing the emperor's lack of conscience according to Tacitus, ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ann.]]'' XII,3; while Graves' account of the same incident appears not to incriminate Claudius).

==Twenty-first century==
One of Tacitus' polemics against the evils of empire, from his ''Agricola'' (ch. 30), was often quoted during the United States [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasions of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]], by those who found its warnings as applicable to the modern era as to the ancient (see for example
[https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,930843,00.html ''The Guardian'']). It reads, in part:
:{|-
|Raptores orbis, postquam cuncta vastantibus defuere terrae, iam mare scrutantur: si locuples hostis est, avari, si pauper, ambitiosi, quos non Oriens, non Occidens satiaverit [...]&lt;br /&gt;Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.
|&amp;nbsp;
|Brigands of the world, after the earth has failed their all-devastating hands, they probe even the sea; if their enemy be wealthy, they are greedy; if he be poor, they are ambitious; neither the East nor the West has glutted them [...]&lt;br /&gt;They plunder, they slaughter, and they steal: this they falsely name Empire, and where they make a wasteland, they call it peace.
|}

On the contrary, the persecution of genius fosters its influence; foreign tyrants, and all who have imitated their oppression, have merely procured infamy for themselves and glory for their victims."
#{{note|series}} A website discussing the ''I, Claudius'' television series, which were based on Graves work, qualifies Tacitus as being of a "somewhat suspect" reliability because of Tacitus' so-called "malice" towards the emperors (see: http://www.anselm.edu/internet/classics/I%2CCLAUDIUS/tacitus.html ). The books by Graves, discussed at the same website (see: http://www.anselm.edu/internet/classics/I%2CCLAUDIUS/graves.html ) are free of such reliability suspicions. So, in sum that website says: Tacitus is not very reliable because he slanders Emperors. Graves is reliable because his story-telling of the Imperial household is so ''convincing''.

'''USS ''Carl Vinson'' (CVN-70)''' is the  [[United States Navy]]'s third {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|0}} [[supercarrier]] and named for [[Carl Vinson]], a Congressman from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in recognition of his contributions to the U.S. Navy. The ship was launched in 1980, undertook her maiden voyage in 1983, and underwent [[refueling and overhaul]] between 2005 and 2009. ''Carl Vinson''{{'}}s [[call sign]] is "Gold Eagle."

Besides deployments in [[Cruise missile strikes on Iraq (1996)|Operation Desert Strike]], [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]], [[Operation Southern Watch]], and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], ''Carl Vinson'' was involved in a number of notable events. The body of [[Osama bin Laden]] was buried at sea in 2011 from the deck of ''Carl Vinson'', and that same year, on [[Veterans Day]], she played host to the first [[2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|NCAA basketball]] game on an aircraft carrier, between [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] and [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]].

==Namesake==
[[File:Ceremonies for marking the 90th birthday of former Congressman Vinson of Georgia - NARA - 194554.tif|thumb|left|President [[Richard Nixon]], Navy Secretary [[John Warner]], and Defense Secretary [[Melvin Laird]] present Congressman Vinson (third from left) with a model of the ship that will bear his name, 18 November 1973.]]
A member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] for 50 years, Carl Vinson was, for 29 years, the Chairman of the House Naval Affairs and Armed Services Committee; Vinson was the principal sponsor of the so-called "Vinson Acts", culminating in the [[Two-Ocean Navy Act]] of 1940, which provided for the massive naval shipbuilding effort in World War II.

===Ship seal===
The seal of USS ''Carl Vinson'' shows an eagle, wings spread and talons extended, carrying a banner in its beak. The eagle is emblematic of the nation and the ship's motto, and also represents the power that resides in the ship's aircraft. The eagle flies in the form of a stylized letter "V," the initial of the ship's namesake, Congressman Carl Vinson. The "V" also represents the ship's hull when viewed bow-on. Inscribed on the banner that the eagle carries is the Latin phrase "''Vis Per Mare''" which means "Strength through the Sea".&lt;ref name="cvn70.navy.mil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cvn70.navy.mil/ |title=Welcome to USS Carl Vinson CVN 70 Public Site |publisher=Cvn70.navy.mil |accessdate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410002423/http://www.cvn70.navy.mil/ |archivedate=10 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carrier Strike Group 1===
In October 2009, the US Navy announced that ''Carl Vinson'' would be the flagship of the newly established [[Carrier Strike Group 1]], based in San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/news/article/navy-news/navy-establishes-carrier-strike-group-1.html?ESRC=navy-a.nl|title=Navy Establishes Carrier Strike Group 1|accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship, under the command of Captain Bruce H. Lindsey, departed Norfolk for San Diego on 12 January 2010. Accompanying the carrier was [[Carrier Air Wing Seventeen]], [[Destroyer Squadron One (United States)|Destroyer Squadron 1]] and the guided missile cruiser [[USS Bunker Hill (CG-52)|''Bunker Hill'']]. As of May 2015, the ship is under the command of Captain Douglas C. Verissimo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=64137|title=USS Carl Vinson Conducts Change of Command|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Patrick, "Carrier Carl Vinson To Leave Tuesday For San Diego", ''[[Norfolk Virginian-Pilot]]'', 9 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and construction==
{{Main|Nimitz-class aircraft carrier}}
The keel was laid at [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding]] on 11 October 1975, and on 15 March 1980 the ship was launched/[[Ship naming and launching|christened]]. Congressman Carl Vinson became the first person in the history of the United States Navy to witness a ship's launching in his honor.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} After builder sea trials, she was delivered to the Navy on 26 February 1982.

==Ship history==

===1980s===
USS ''Carl Vinson'' was commissioned on 13 March 1982 at Newport News, Virginia, with Captain Richard Martin commanding. Present were the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Thomas B. Hayward]], [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[John F. Lehman]], keynote speaker Senator [[John Tower]], and ship's sponsor [[Molly Snead]]. After commissioning, ''Carl Vinson'' put to sea to conduct [[flight deck]] certifications, an evaluation designed to test the ship's ability to conduct [[modern US Navy carrier air operations]]. That was followed by numerous at sea periods for various training evolutions along the East Coast.&lt;ref name="cvn70.navy.mil"/&gt;

''Carl Vinson'' departed Norfolk on 1 March 1983 with [[Carrier Air Wing 15]] embarked for her [[Maiden voyage|maiden deployment]], an eight-month, around-the-world cruise that had them operate in the Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, [[South China Sea]], and Pacific Ocean in a multitude of exercises and with port visits in Monte Carlo, Monaco, Casablanca, Morocco, Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Perth, Australia, Subic Bay, Philippines, Hong Kong, Sasebo, Japan, Pusan, Republic of Korea, and [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, before arriving in her new homeport of [[Naval Air Station Alameda]], California, arriving on 28 October 1983.&lt;ref name="cvn70.navy.mil"/&gt;

''Carl Vinson'' participated in [[RIMPAC]] '84 before departing on 14 October 1984 for an overseas deployment in the [[Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]]. [[Carrier Air Wing 15]] was embarked. From January until April 1985, ''Carl Vinson'' was in the Indian Ocean for 107 consecutive days. The WESTPAC deployment included Sea of Japan operations while pursuing a Soviet [[Charlie class submarine|Charlie I]] class submarine in the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/shiphist/c/cvn-70/1985.pdf
|title=1985 COMMAND HISTORY
|author=G.D. O'Brien, Jr
|date=30 November 1988
|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The carrier received her first [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for operations conducted from November 1984 to May 1985. In February, the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] named ''Carl Vinson'' the winner of the Admiral [[James H. Flatley]] Memorial Award for operational readiness and aviation safety for 1984.

On 12 August 1986, the ship departed Alameda for a western Pacific deployment, again with CVW-15 aboard, and in the process became the first modern U.S. aircraft carrier to operate in the [[Bering Sea]]. In January 1987, after operating extensively in the Indian Ocean and North [[Arabian Sea]], ''Carl Vinson'' transited the Bering Sea once more while returning to NAS Alameda.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/archives/command-operation-reports/ship-command-operation-reports/c/carl-vinson-cvn-70-i/pdf/1987.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

''Carl Vinson'' and CVW-15 departed for the ship's fourth overseas deployment on 15 June 1988. While on station, the carrier supported [[Operation Earnest Will]], the escort of U.S. flagged [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]] in the [[Persian Gulf]]. The carrier returned to the States on 16 December 1988 and was awarded the Admiral Flatley Memorial Award for aviation safety for 1988.

On 18 September 1989, the carrier departed Alameda to participate in [[PACEX]] '89, the largest peacetime [[Military exercise|naval exercise]] since the Second World War. During the exercise ''Carl Vinson'' operated in the Bering Sea and the [[Aleutian Islands]], eventually leading a three-carrier battle group operation in the [[Sea of Japan]] and the Pacific Ocean. ''Carl Vinson'' had a port call in [[Busan|Pusan]], South Korea, and then returned to her home port of Alameda shortly after the devastating [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/archives/command-operation-reports/ship-command-operation-reports/c/carl-vinson-cvn-70-i/pdf/1988.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2001, ''Carl Vinson'' hosted Gene Hackman, David Keith, Owen Wilson, and others for filming of the carrier scenes for the movie ''Behind Enemy Lines'' during intermediate pre-deployment underway workups. During this two-week period, ''Vinson'' crewmembers and CVW 11 crews took part in the filming along with the actors and film crews. Later, prior to commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom, David Keith returned to ''Vinson'' on station in the North Arabian Sea to present the first international viewing of ''Behind Enemy Lines'' to the combined ship and air wing crew.

On 23 July 2001, again with CVW-11 embarked, ''Carl Vinson'' steamed from Bremerton, Washington, bound for the Persian Gulf to support [[Operation Southern Watch]]. This changed abruptly on 11 September 2001, as the ship was rounding the tip of India. In response to the [[11 September 2001 attacks|terror attacks]] on U.S. soil, ''Vinson'' changed course and sped toward the North [[Arabian Sea]], where on 7 October 2001, ''Vinson'' launched the first airstrikes in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/trade.center/deployment.map/vinson.html

''Carl Vinson'' earned the Battle E and Navy Unit Commendation during this deployment. In mid December, ''Carl Vinson'' began the return trip home, briefly stopping in Pearl Harbor Hawaii to commence a "Tiger Cruise" allowing crew member family members the opportunity to ride the ship to Vinson's homeport of Bremerton Wa. reaching the U.S. on 23 January 2002. In April, the ship was overhauled, setting sail in September for a post-refit shakedown. During this time several new operational systems were installed, and the ship's flight deck and catapults were completely renovated. Numerous other spaces and crew living areas were also entirely restored, drastically improving working and living conditions for the crew. Completing its maintenance / overhaul period in record-setting time, USS ''Carl Vinson'' and crew got underway in September to conduct sea trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Journalist 3rd Class Mat Sohl, USS Carl Vinson Public Affairs |url=http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=3486 |title=USS Carl Vinson: Back in Action Following a Record-Setting Yard Period |publisher=News.navy.mil |accessdate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913121934/http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=3486 |archivedate=13 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During January 2012, ''Carl Vinson'' began its patrol of the Arabian Sea.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

On 23 May 2012, ''Carl Vinson'' returned to  [[Naval Air Station North Island]], California, to end its November 2011 deployment. It had stopped earlier in Hawaii to pick up approximately 900 "Tigers" – friends and family of the sailors aboard the ship who traveled with the ship from Hawaii to San Diego.

On 5 July 2012, ''Carl Vinson'' began preparations for a Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) period. PIA is a major maintenance phase that all American naval vessels must go through multiple times throughout their lifetime to be able to sustain underway operations. PIA 2012–2013 for ''Carl Vinson'' included overhauls of over 40 crew living spaces, 30 heads and hundreds of workspaces throughout the ship. It also included upgrades to many of the electronics and defense systems that the ship uses during deployments, to include an upgrade from the [[Global Command and Control System]]-Maritime (GCCS-M) to the [[Distributed Common Ground System]]-Navy (DCGS-N).

On 30 January 2013, ''Carl Vinson'' commenced sea trials, marking its first time underway in seven months, since its ammo offload which ended on 29 June 2012. Upon returning from this underway period, the ship's commanding officer, Captain Kent Whalen, announced on 2 February 2013 that PIA had officially ended, marking the first on-time PIA completion since 1999. Since February 2013, the ship has been underway multiple times conducting carrier qualifications with [[Carrier Air Wing Seventeen]] as well as multiple crew certification exercises. The most recent accomplishment for ''Carl Vinson'' was the completion of its evaluation of nuclear reactor operation. During this evaluation, the [[Naval Sea Systems Command]] embarks a team of proctors who put the ship's engineering department through a multitude of drills and exercises to test their ability to safely operate a nuclear reactor and to contain any casualty of the reactor as it occurs. This was completed on 1 July 2013.

On 22 August 2014, ''Carl Vinson'' and assigned [[Carrier Air Wing Seventeen|CVW-17]] began a scheduled deployment to the U.S. [[United States Fifth Fleet|5th]] and [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]] areas of responsibility. {{USS|Bunker Hill|CG-52|6}}, Destroyer Squadron 1 and its ships {{USS|Gridley|DDG-101|6}}, {{USS|Sterett|DDG-104|6}}, and {{USS|Dewey|DDG-105|6}} deployed with the carrier as part of the ''Carl Vinson'' Carrier Strike Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=82905{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carrier was deployed to the Persian Gulf to relieve USS ''George H. W. Bush'' in fighting the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/09/30/navy-replaces-ships-in-arabian-gulf-as-bombing-continues.html|title=Navy Replaces Ships in Arabian Gulf as Bombing Continues|first=Sean|last=OMelveny|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 September 2014 at 17:40 hrs local time, two F/A-18C's from CVW-17 crashed in the western Pacific Ocean whilst operating from ''Carl Vinson''. The carrier was in its area of operations in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region. The planes where attached to Strike Squadron 94 and Strike Fighter Squadron 113 and collided 7 miles from the carrier, an area approximately 290 miles west of Wake Island. USS ''Bunker Hill'', USS ''Gridley'', USS ''Sterett'', USS ''Dewey'', and helicopters assigned to Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 15 (HSC 15) and Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 73 (HSM 73) assisted in the search for the pilots. Whilst one pilot was recovered alive soon after the crash, the second pilot could not be located. The Navy continued its search for the second pilot until 13 September 2014, when the search was abandoned.

''Carl Vinson'' returned to San Diego on 4 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=87493|title=Team Carl Vinson Returns to San Diego|first=This story was written by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Travis Alston, USS Carl Vinson Public|last=Affairs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the deployment, supporting strike operations in Iraq and Syria, CVW-17 successfully flew 12,300 sorties, including 2,382 combat missions and dropped more than half a million pounds (230 tons) of ordnance against ISIS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=87476 ''Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group Returns from Western Pacific, U.S. Central Command Deployment''], NNS150604-24 from Commander, Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 1 Public Affairs, retrieved 6 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 2015, ''Carl Vinson'' began a planned incremental availability (PIA) period at [[Naval Air Station North Island]]. The ship received more than $300 million worth of improvements over six months during this modernisation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=90624 Team Carl Vinson Begins PIA], story number NNS150814-24 by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Travis S.

In 2016, [[Carrier Air Wing Two]] was reassigned to ''Carl Vinson''. The carrier began its next scheduled deployment to the Western Pacific with CVW-2 on 5 January 2017.&lt;ref name=NNNS170105-041&gt;{{cite web | author= USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) Public Affairs | title= Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group Begins Western Pacific Deployment| url= http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=98352 | work= NNS170105-04 | publisher= USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) Public Affairs | date= 5 January 2017 | accessdate=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid February 2017, it was reported that the ''Carl Vinson'' strike group started what it called "routine operations" in the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-39018882|title=South China Sea: US carrier group begins 'routine' patrols|date=19 February 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first half of April 2017, the strike group was reportedly ordered towards the Korean Peninsula amid growing concerns about North Korea's ballistic missile program. It had recently conducted training exercises with the [[Republic of Korea Navy|ROK Navy]] in the Western Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-39542990|title=North Korea missiles: US warships deployed to Korean peninsula|date=9 April 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "We are sending an armada," [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]] announced on 12 April 2017, sending a signal to deter North Korea after missile and nuclear provocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/384554-us-armada-china-korea-menace/|title='We are sending an armada': Trump ready to eliminate N.

Confusion appeared to stem from a "glitch-ridden sequence of events" that included a premature announcement of the deployment from the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/world/asia/aircraft-carrier-north-korea-carl-vinson.html|title=Aircraft Carrier Wasn't Sailing to Deter North Korea, as U.S. Suggested|first1=Mark|last1=Landler|first2=Eric|last2=Schmitt|date=18 April 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2018, ''Carl Vinson'' left San Diego for her next scheduled deployment to the Western Pacific.&lt;ref name=NNS180105-11&gt;{{cite web | author= Carrier Strike Group 1 Public Affairs | title= Carl Vinson Strike Group Departs for Deployment to Western Pacific| url= http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=103944 | work= NNS180105-11 | publisher= Carrier Strike Group 1 Public Affairs | date= 5 January 2018 | accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 March 2018, the ship entered [[Da Nang Port]], alongside {{USS|Lake Champlain|CG-57}} and {{USS|Wayne E. Meyer|DDG-108}}, on a scheduled visit to Vietnam. This visit was planned from when President [[Donald Trump]] was on a State visit to [[Vietnam]]. U.S. Navy sailors on the ships engaged in cultural activities and training with the Vietnamese Navy. This visit was hoped to "increase the relations between the two countries."&lt;ref name= NNS180305-03&gt;{{cite web | author= Carl Vinson Strike Group Public Affairs | title= US Aircraft Carrier Arrives in Vietnam for Historic Visit| url= http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=104590 | work=  NNS180305-03 | publisher= Carl Vinson Strike Group Public Affairs | date= 5 March 2018 | accessdate=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Carl Vinson'' returned to San Diego on 12 April 2018. In July 2018, ''Carl Vinson'' participated in exercise RIMPAC 2018.

On 2 August 2018, it was announced that ''Carl Vinson'' will move from [[San Diego]] to [[Naval Base Kitsap]] to go through a period of maintenance at [[Puget Sound]]. {{USS|John C. Stennis|CVN-74|6}} will change homeport to [[Norfolk, Virginia]] in advance of its reactor complex overhaul (RCOH) at Newport News Shipbuilding and {{USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72|6}} will replace ''Carl Vinson'' at San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= U.S. Navy | title= Three Aircraft Carriers to Change Homeports | url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=106596 | work= NNS180802-19 | publisher= from Commander, Naval Air Forces Public Affairs | date= 2 August 2018 | accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vastu shastra (''{{IAST|vāstu śāstra}}'') is a traditional Hindu system of architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quack|first1=Johannes|title=Disenchanting India: Organized Rationalism and Criticism of Religion in India|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=119|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TNbxUwhS5RUC&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which literally translates to "science of architecture."&lt;ref name="narlikar_CUP"/&gt; These are texts found on the Indian subcontinent that describe principles of design, layout, measurements, ground preparation, space arrangement, and spatial geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vastukarta.com/principles_of_vastu.php|title=GOLDEN PRINCIPLES OF VASTU SHASTRA Vastukarta|website=www.vastukarta.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pka/&gt; Vastu Shastras incorporate traditional Hindu and in some cases Buddhist beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vastushastra|first=Vijaya |last=Kumar|publisher=New Dawn/Sterling|year=2002|isbn=978-81-207-2199-9|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designs are intended to integrate architecture with nature, the relative functions of various parts of the structure, and ancient beliefs utilizing geometric patterns ([[yantra]]), symmetry, and [[Direction (geometry, geography)|directional]] alignments.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;

Vastu Shastra are the textual part of ''Vastu Vidya'', the latter being the broader knowledge about architecture and design theories from ancient India.&lt;ref name=vsgt1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Sachdev, Giles Tillotson|title=Building Jaipur: The Making of an Indian City|date=2004|isbn=978-1861891372|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vastu Vidya knowledge is a collection of ideas and concepts, with or without the support of layout diagrams, that are not rigid. Rather, these ideas and concepts are models for the organization of space and form within a building or collection of buildings, based on their functions in relation to each other, their usage and to the overall fabric of the Vastu.&lt;ref name=vsgt1/&gt; Ancient Vastu Shastra principles include those for the design of ''Mandir'' ([[Hindu temple]]s),&lt;ref&gt;George Michell (1988), The Hindu Temple: An Introduction to Its Meaning and Forms, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226532301}}, pp 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; and the principles for the design and layout of houses, towns, cities, gardens, roads, water works, shops and other public areas.&lt;ref name=pka/&gt;&lt;ref name="GD Vasudev 2001 pp 74-92"&gt;GD Vasudev (2001), Vastu, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|81-208-1605-6}}, pp 74-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherri Silverman 2007"&gt;Sherri Silverman (2007), Vastu: Transcendental Home Design in Harmony with Nature, Gibbs Smith, Utah, {{ISBN|978-1423601326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The Sanskrit word ''vastu'' means a dwelling or house with a corresponding plot of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Latest Vastu Shastra (Some Secrets)|first=Jagdish|last= Gautum|page=17|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=2006|isbn=978-81-7017-449-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[vrddhi]], ''vāstu'', takes the meaning of "the site or foundation of a house, site, ground, building or dwelling-place, habitation, homestead, house". The underlying root is ''vas'' "to dwell, live, stay, reside".&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams (1899).&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[shastra]] may loosely be translated as  "doctrine, teaching".

''Vastu-Sastras'' (literally, science of dwelling) are ancient Sanskrit manuals of architecture. These contain Vastu-Vidya (literally, knowledge of dwelling).&lt;ref name=bbdutt&gt;BB Dutt (1925), {{Google books|J3jEJFNxdy4C|Town planning in Ancient India}}, {{ISBN|978-81-8205-487-5}}; See critical review by LD Barnett, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol 4, Issue 2, June 1926, pp 391&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Proposals tracing potential links of the principles of composition in ''Vastu Shastra'' and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] have been made, but [[Kapila Vatsyayan]] is reluctant to speculate on such links given the Indus Valley script remains undeciphered.&lt;ref name="Singer1991p117"&gt;{{cite book|author=Milton Singer|title=Semiotics of Cities, Selves, and Cultures: Explorations in Semiotic Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9G6h1EfTTwC&amp;pg=PA117 |year=1991|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-085775-7|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chakrabarti, Vastu Vidya is as old the Vedic period and linked to the ritual architecture.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti2013p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vibhuti Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory and Practice: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgmakH37M0UC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-77882-7|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Michael W.

==Description==
[[File:Plan of Kandariya Mahadeva temple.jpg|thumb|360px|Ancient India produced many Sanskrit manuals of architecture, called Vastu Sastra. Many of these are about Hindu temple layout (above), design and construction, along with chapters on design principles for houses, villages, towns. The architect and artists (Silpins) were given wide latitude to experiment and express their creativity.&lt;ref name=mmgeometry/&gt;]]
There exist many Vastu-Sastras on the art of building houses, temples, towns and cities. One such Vastu Sastra is by [[Thakkura Pheru]], describing where and how temples should be built.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1976), The Hindu Temple Volume 1 &amp; 2, {{ISBN|81-208-0223-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Hebner (2010), Architecture of the Vastu Sastra - According to Sacred Science, in Science of the Sacred (Editor: David Osborn), {{ISBN|978-0557277247}}, pp 85-92; N Lahiri (1996), Archaeological landscapes and textual images: a study of the sacred geography of late medieval Ballabgarh, World Archaeology, 28(2), pp 244-264&lt;/ref&gt; By 6th century AD, Sanskrit manuals for constructing palatial temples were in circulation in India.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Lewandowski (1984), Buildings and Society: Essays on the Social Development of the Built Environment, edited by Anthony D. King, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0710202345}}, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; Vastu-Sastra manuals included chapters on home construction, town planning,&lt;ref name=bbdutt/&gt; and how efficient villages, towns and kingdoms integrated temples, water bodies and gardens within them to achieve harmony with nature.&lt;ref name="GD Vasudev 2001 pp 74-92"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherri Silverman 2007"/&gt; While it is unclear, states Barnett,&lt;ref&gt;LD Barnett, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol 4, Issue 2, June 1926, pp 391&lt;/ref&gt; as to whether these temple and town planning texts were theoretical studies and if or when they were properly implemented in practice, the manuals suggest that town planning and Hindu temples were conceived as ideals of art and integral part of Hindu social and spiritual life.&lt;ref name=bbdutt/&gt;

The ''Silpa Prakasa'' of Odisha, authored by Ramachandra Bhattaraka Kaulachara sometime in ninth or tenth century CE, is another Vastu Sastra.&lt;ref name=aliceboner66&gt;Alice Boner and Sadāśiva Rath Śarmā (1966), {{Google books|itQUAAAAIAAJ|Silpa Prakasa Medieval Orissan Sanskrit Text on Temple Architecture}}, E.J. Brill (Netherlands)&lt;/ref&gt; Silpa Prakasa describes the geometric principles in every aspect of the temple and symbolism such as 16 emotions of human beings carved as 16 types of female figures. These styles were perfected in Hindu temples prevalent in eastern states of India. Other ancient texts found expand these architectural principles, suggesting that different parts of India developed, invented and added their own interpretations. For example, in ''Saurastra'' tradition of temple building found in western states of India, the feminine form, expressions and emotions are depicted in 32 types of ''Nataka-stri'' compared to 16 types described in ''Silpa Prakasa''.&lt;ref name=aliceboner66/&gt; Silpa Prakasa provides brief introduction to 12 types of Hindu temples. Other texts, such as ''Pancaratra Prasada Prasadhana'' compiled by Daniel Smith&lt;ref&gt;H. Daniel Smith (1963), Ed. Pāncarātra prasāda prasādhapam, A Pancaratra Text on Temple-Building, Syracuse: University of Rochester, {{OCLC|68138877}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Silpa Ratnakara compiled by Narmada Sankara&lt;ref&gt;Mahanti and Mahanty (1995 Reprint), Śilpa Ratnākara, Orissa Akademi, {{OCLC|42718271}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide a more extensive list of Hindu temple types.

Ancient Sanskrit manuals for temple construction discovered in Rajasthan, in northwestern region of India, include Sutradhara Mandana’s ''Prasadamandana'' (literally, manual for planning and building a temple) with chapters on town building.&lt;ref&gt;Amita Sinha (1998), Design of Settlements in the Vaastu Shastras, Journal of Cultural Geography, 17(2), pp 27-41, {{doi|10.1080/08873639809478319}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Manasara shilpa'' and ''Mayamata'', texts of South Indian origin, estimated to be in circulation by 5th to 7th century AD, is a guidebook on South Indian Vastu design and construction.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tillotson, G. H. R. (1997). Svastika Mansion: A Silpa-Sastra in the 1930s. South Asian Studies, 13(1), pp 87-97&lt;/ref&gt; ''Isanasivagurudeva paddhati'' is another Sanskrit text from the 9th century describing the art of building in India in south and central India.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ganapati Sastri (1920), Īśānaśivagurudeva paddhati, Trivandrum Sanskrit Series, {{OCLC|71801033}}&lt;/ref&gt; In north India, ''Brihat-samhita'' by [[Varāhamihira]] is the widely cited ancient Sanskrit manual from 6th century describing the design and construction of ''Nagara'' style of Hindu temples.&lt;ref name=mmgeometry&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meister |first=Michael W. |author-link=Michael W.

These ancient ''Vastu Sastras'', often discuss and describe the principles of Hindu temple design, but do not limit themselves to the design of a Hindu temple.&lt;ref&gt;S Bafna, On the Idea of the Mandala as a Governing Device in Indian Architectural Tradition, Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 59, No. 1 (Mar., 2000), pp. 26-49&lt;/ref&gt; They describe the temple as a holistic part of its community, and lay out various principles and a diversity of alternate designs for home, village and city layout along with the temple, gardens, water bodies and nature.&lt;ref name="Sherri Silverman 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=stellakvolm1&gt;[[Stella Kramrisch]], The Hindu Temple, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0222-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandala types and properties==
[[File:64 grid Manduka design Hindu Temple Floor Plan Vastu Purusa Mandala Ancient Architecture.svg|thumb|220px|The 8x8 (64) grid Manduka Vastu Purusha Mandala layout for [[Hindu Temple]]s. It is one of 32 Vastu Purusha Mandala grid patterns described in Vastu sastras. In this grid structure of symmetry, each concentric layer has significance.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;]]
The central area in all [[mandala]] is the [[Brahmasthana]]. Mandala "circle-circumference" or "completion", is a concentric diagram having spiritual and ritual significance in both Hinduism and Buddhism. The space occupied by it varies in different [[mandala]] – in ''Pitha'' (9) and ''Upapitha'' (25) it occupies one square module, in ''Mahaapitha'' (16), ''Ugrapitha'' (36) and ''Manduka'' (64), four square modules and in ''Sthandila'' (49) and ''Paramasaayika'' (81), nine square modules.&lt;ref name=vcm/&gt; The Pitha is an amplified Prithvimandala in which, according to some texts, the central space is occupied by earth. The Sthandila mandala is used in a concentric manner.&lt;ref name=vcm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0700711130|pages=86–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important [[mandala]] is the Manduka/ Chandita Mandala of 64 squares and the Paramasaayika Mandala of 81 squares. The normal position of the Vastu Purusha (head in the northeast, legs in the southwest) is as depicted in the Paramasaayika Mandala. However, in the Manduka Mandala the Vastu Purusha is depicted with the head facing east and the feet facing west. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
[[File:Vastu direction chakar.jpg|thumb|vastu directional chakara]]
It is believed that every piece of a land or a building has a soul of its own and that soul is known as Vastu Purusha.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockingbaba.com/blog/index.php/2015/07/06/vastu-for-beginners-blog-3/&lt;/ref&gt;

A site of any shape can be divided using the Pada Vinyasa. Sites are known by the number of squares. They range from 1x1 to 32x32 (1024) square sites. Examples of mandalas with the corresponding names of sites include:&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;
* ''Sakala'' (1 square) corresponds to ''Eka-pada'' (single divided site)
* ''Pechaka'' (4 squares) corresponds to ''Dwi-pada'' (two divided site)
* ''Pitha'' (9 squares) corresponds to ''Tri-pada'' (three divided site)
* ''Mahaapitha'' (16 squares) corresponds to ''Chatush-pada'' (four divided site)
* ''Upapitha'' (25 squares) corresponds to ''Pancha-pada'' (five divided site)
* ''Ugrapitha'' (36 squares) corresponds to ''Shashtha-pada'' (six divided site)
* ''Sthandila'' (49 squares) corresponds to ''Sapta-pada'' (seven divided site)
* ''Manduka/ Chandita'' (64 square) corresponds to ''Ashta-pada'' (eight divided site))
* ''Paramasaayika'' (81 squares) corresponds to ''Nava-pada'' (nine divided site)
* ''Aasana'' (100 squares) corresponds to ''Dasa-pada'' (ten divided site)
* ''Bhadrmahasan'' (196 squares) corresponds to ''Chodah-pada'' (14 divided sites)

==Modern adaptations and usage==
[[File:Plan, Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur, Rajasthan.JPG|thumb|Vastu Shastra-inspired plan adapted and evolved by modern architect [[Charles Correa]] in the design of Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur, Rajasthan.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=kpg1/&gt;]]

Vastu sastra represents a body of ancient concepts and knowledge to many modern architects, a guideline but not a rigid code.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt; The square-grid mandala is viewed as a model of organization, not as a ground plan. The ancient Vastu sastra texts describe functional relations and adaptable alternate layouts for various rooms or buildings and utilities, but do not mandate a set compulsory architecture. Sachdev and Tillotson state that the mandala is a guideline, and employing the mandala concept of Vastu sastra does not mean every room or building has to be square.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt; The basic theme is around core elements of central space, peripheral zones, direction with respect to sunlight, and relative functions of the spaces.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;

The pink city [[Jaipur]] in Rajasthan was master planned by Rajput king [[Jai Singh II|Jai Singh]] and built by 1727 CE, in part around Vastu Shilpa Sastra principles.&lt;ref name=vsgt2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Sachdev, Giles Tillotson|title=Building Jaipur: The Making of an Indian City|date=2004|isbn=978-1861891372|pages=155–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nus1&gt;[http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-07-jantar_mantar.pdf Jantar Mantar &amp; Jaipur - Section II] National University of Singapore, pp. 17-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nus1/&gt; Similarly, modern era projects such as the architect [[Charles Correa]]'s designed [[Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya]] in [[Ahmedabad]], Vidhan Bhavan in [[Bhopal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irena Murray|title=Charles Correa: India's Greatest Architect|date=2011|publisher=RIBA Publishing|isbn=978-1859465172}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jawahar Kala Kendra]] in Jaipur, adapt and apply concepts from the Vastu Shastra Vidya.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc1&gt;{{cite book|last1=V Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0700711130|date=2013|pages=86–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the design of [[Chandigarh]] city, [[Le Corbusier]] incorporated modern architecture theories with those of Vastu Shastra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=SAJAH|date=2011|volume=26|issue=3|pages=45–56|author=Gerald Steyn|title=Le Corbusier’s research-based design approaches|url=http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/20055/Steyn_LeCorbusier(2011).pdf?sequence=1|publisher=Tshwane University of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=H Saini|title=Vaastu ordains a full flowering for Chandigarh|date=1996|publisher=The Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reena Patra|title=Vaastu Shastra: Towards Sustainable Development|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2009|volume=17|pages=244–256|publisher=Wiley InterScience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial rule period of India, town planning officials of the [[British Raj]] did not consider Vastu Vidya, but largely grafted Islamic Mughal era motifs and designs such as domes and arches onto Victorian-era style buildings without overall relationship layout.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anthony D'Costa|title=A New India?: Critical Reflections in the Long Twentieth Century|pages=165–168|isbn=978-0857285041}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement, later known as the Indo-Saracenic style, is found in chaotically laid out, but externally grand structures in the form of currently used major railway stations, harbors, tax collection buildings, and other colonial offices in South Asia.&lt;ref name=vsgt3&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Sachdev, Giles Tillotson|title=Building Jaipur: The Making of an Indian City|date=2004|isbn=978-1861891372|pages=149–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vastu sastra vidya was ignored, during colonial era construction, for several reasons. These texts were viewed by 19th and early 20th century architects as archaic, the literature was inaccessible being in an ancient language not spoken or read by the architects, and the ancient texts assumed space to be readily available.&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt; In contrast, public projects in the colonial era were forced into crowded spaces and local layout constraints, and the ancient Vastu sastra were viewed with prejudice as superstitious and rigid about a square grid or traditional materials of construction.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt; Sachdev and Tillotson state that these prejudices were flawed, as a scholarly and complete reading of the Vastu sastra literature amply suggests the architect is free to adapt the ideas to new materials of construction, local layout constraints and into a non-square space.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc2&gt;{{cite book|last1=V Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0700711130|date=2013|pages=86–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design and completion of a new city of [[Jaipur]] in early 1700s based on Vastu sastra texts, well before any colonial era public projects, was one of many proofs.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc2/&gt; Other examples include modern public projects designed by [[Charles Correa]] such as Jawahar Kala Kendra in Jaipur, and Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=kpg1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klaus-Peter Gast|title=Modern Traditions: Contemporary Architecture in India|page=11|isbn=978-3764377540|date=2011|publisher=Birkhäuser Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vastu Shastra remedies have also been applied by Khushdeep Bansal in 1997 to the Parliament complex of India, when he contented that the library being built next to the building is responsible for political instability in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/harmonising-homes-hearts/story-UR90utlqvNojXaolxBmtNN.html | title=‘Harmonising’ homes, hearts | publisher=[[Hindustan Times]] | date= 9 June 2012 | accessdate= 4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German architect Klaus-Peter Gast states that the principles of Vastu Shastras is witnessing a major revival and wide usage in the planning and design of individual homes, residential complexes, commercial and industrial campuses, and major public projects in India, along with the use of ancient iconography and mythological art work incorporated into the Vastu vidya architectures.&lt;ref name=kpg1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephen Marshall|title=Urban Coding and Planning|pages=83–103|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415441261|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vastu and superstition ===
{{see also|Superstition in India#Vastu Shastra}}
The use of ''Vastu shastra'' and ''Vastu consultants'' in modern home and public projects is controversial.&lt;ref name=vc2/&gt; Some architects, particularly during India's colonial era, considered it arcane and superstitious.&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt; Other architects state that critics have not read the texts and that most of the text is about flexible design guidelines for space, sunlight, flow and function.&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm1/&gt;

Vastu Shastra is considered as pseudoscience by rationalists like [[Narendra Nayak]] of [[Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations]].&lt;ref name=OUP-Johannes&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quack|first1=Johannes|title=Disenchanting India: Organized Rationalism and Criticism of Religion in India|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=170|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TNbxUwhS5RUC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientist and astronomer [[Jayant Narlikar]] considers Vastu Shastra as pseudoscience and writes that Vastu does not have any "logical connection" to the environment.&lt;ref name="narlikar_CUP"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Narlikar|first1=Jayant V.|editor1-last=Percy|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Pasachoff|editor2-first=Jay|title=Teaching and Learning Astronomy: Effective Strategies for Educators Worldwide|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=165|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=mdzQ4uCnYfkC&amp;pg=PA165|chapter=Astronomy, pseudoscience and rational thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the examples cited by Narlikar arguing the absence of logical connection is the Vastu rule, "sites shaped like a triangle ... will lead to government harassment, ... parallelogram can lead to quarrels in the family." Narlikar notes that sometimes the building plans are changed and what has already been built is demolished to accommodate for Vastu rules.&lt;ref name="narlikar_CUP"/&gt; Regarding superstitious beliefs in Vastu, Science writer [[Meera Nanda]] cites the case of [[N.T.Rama Rao]], the ex-chief minister of [[Andhra Pradesh]], who sought the help of Vastu consultants for his political problems. Rama Rao was advised that his problems would be solved if he entered his office from an east facing gate. Accordingly, a slum on the east facing side of his office was ordered to be demolished, to make way for his car's entrance.&lt;ref name=Sokal&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sokal|first1=Alan|title=Beyond the Hoax: Science, Philosophy and Culture|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=306–307|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=SjBdUTpf184C&amp;pg=PT407}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knowledge of Vastu consultants is questioned by Pramod Kumar (citation required), "Ask the Vaastu folks if they know civil engineering or architecture or the local government rules on construction or minimum standards of construction to advise people on buildings. They will get into a barrage of "ancient" texts and "science" that smack of the pseudo-science of astrology. Ask them where they were before the construction boom and if they will go to slum tenements to advise people or advise on low-cost community-housing—you draw a blank."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kumar|first1=Pramod|title=Akshaya Tritiya and the great Indian superstition industry|url=http://www.firstpost.com/business/akshaya-tritiya-and-the-great-indian-superstition-industry-781471.html|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Firstpost|date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Viking expansion''' is the process by which [[Norse]] explorers, traders and warriors, the latter known in modern scholarship as [[Vikings]], sailed most of the [[North Atlantic]], reaching south to North Africa and east to Russia, [[Constantinople]] and the Middle East as looters, traders, colonists and mercenaries. Vikings under [[Leif Erikson]], the heir to [[Erik the Red]], reached North America and set up a short-lived settlement in present-day [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], Canada. Longer lasting and more established settlements were formed in Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Great Britain, Ireland and [[Normandy]].

==Motivation for expansion== 
There is much debate among historians about what drove the Viking expansion. One widely held idea is that it was a quest for retaliation against continental Europeans for their previous invasions of Viking homelands, such as [[Charlemagne]]'s campaign to force Scandinavian pagans to convert to Christianity by killing any who refused to become baptized.&lt;ref name=Simek2005&gt;Rudolf Simek, "The emergence of the Viking age: circumstances and conditions", ''The Vikings first Europeans VIII&amp;nbsp;— XI century&amp;nbsp;— the new discoveries of archaeology'', other, 2005, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Dumézil, master of Conference at Paris X-Nanterre, Normalien, aggregated history, author of ''Conversion and freedom in the barbarian kingdoms, 5th - 8th centuries'' (Fayard, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "annals R.20"&gt;"Franques Royal Annals" cited in Peter Sawyer, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings'', 2001, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire d'histoire de France'' – Perrin&amp;nbsp;— Alain Decaux and André Castelot. 1981.  pp. 184–85 {{ISBN|2-7242-3080-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Les vikings : Histoire, mythes, dictionnaire'' R. Boyer , Robert Laffont, 2008, p96 {{ISBN|978-2-221-10631-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Rudolf Simek has observed, "It is not a coincidence if the early Viking activity occurred during the reign of Charlemagne."&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Simek, "the emergence of the Viking age: circumstances and conditions", "The vikings first Europeans VIII&amp;nbsp;— XI century&amp;nbsp;— the new discoveries of archaeology", other, 2005, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[François-Xavier Dillmann]], ''Viking civilisation and culture. A bibliography of French-language'', Caen, Centre for research on the countries of the North and Northwest, University of Caen, 1975, p. 19, and ''Les Vikings&amp;nbsp;— the Scandinavian and European 800–1200'', 22nd exhibition of art from the Council of Europe, 1992, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who favor this explanation point out that the penetration of Christianity into Scandinavia caused serious conflict and divided Norway for almost a century.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Kings of Norway'' by Snorri Sturlusson translated by Professor of History François-Xavier Dillmann, Gallimard {{ISBN|2-07-073211-8}} pp. 15–16, 18, 24, 33, 34, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first target of Viking raids was not the Frankish Kingdom, but Christian monasteries in England. According to the historian [[Peter Sawyer (historian)|Peter Sawyer]], these were raided because they were centers of wealth and their farms well-stocked, not because of any religious reasons.&lt;ref name=sawyer96&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sawyer |first=Peter |title=The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings |location=Oxford |year=2001 |publisher=OUP |isbn=0-19-285434-8 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nicholas Roerich, Guests from Overseas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Guest from Overseas''.  [[Nicholas Roerich]]. 1901]]

Another idea is that the Viking population had exceeded the agricultural potential of their homeland. This may have been true of western Norway, where there were few reserves of land, but it is unlikely the rest of Scandinavia was experiencing famine.&lt;ref name=sawyer3&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sawyer |first=Peter |title=The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings |location=Oxford |year=2001 |publisher=OUP |isbn=0-19-285434-8 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, some scholars propose that the Viking expansion was driven by a [[youth bulge]] effect: since the eldest son of a family customarily inherited the family's entire estate, younger sons had to seek their fortune by emigrating or engaging in raids. Peter Sawyer suggests that most Vikings emigrated due the attractiveness of owning more land rather than the necessity of having it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings|last=Sawyer|first=Peter|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, no rise in population, youth bulge, or decline in agricultural production during this period has been definitively demonstrated. Nor is it clear why such pressures would have prompted expansion overseas rather than into the vast, uncultivated forest areas in the interior of the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], although perhaps emigration or sea raids may have been easier or more profitable than clearing large areas of forest for farm and pasture in a region with a limited growing season.

An idea that avoids these shortcomings is that the Scandinavians might have practiced selective procreation leading to a [[female infanticide|shortage of women]], and that the Vikings' main motive for emigration was to [[Raptio|acquire wives]], although this would not explain why the Vikings chose to settle in other countries rather than bringing the women back with them to Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Barrett, "What caused the Viking Age?" ''Antiquity'' Volume 82 Number 317 (September 2008), 671–685; [http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/09/17/viking-women.html "Viking Age Triggered by Shortage of Wives?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible that a decline in the profitability of old trade routes drove the Vikings to seek out new, more profitable ones. Trade between western Europe and the rest of Eurasia may have suffered after the [[Roman Empire]] lost its western provinces in the 5th century, and the [[expansion of Islam]] in the 7th century may have reduced trade opportunities within western Europe by redirecting resources along the [[Silk Road]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Trade in the Mediterranean was at its lowest level in history when the Vikings began their expansion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The Viking expansion opened new trade routes in Arab and Frankish lands, and took control of trade markets previously dominated by the Frisians after the Franks'  destroyed the [[Frisia]]n fleet.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Settlement demographics===
[[File:The Ravager.jpg|left|thumb|''The Ravager''&lt;br /&gt;[[John Charles Dollman]], 1909]]

Viking settlements in Ireland and Great Britain are thought to have been primarily male enterprises, however some graves show nearly equal male/female distribution. Disagreement is partly due to method of classification; previous archaeology often guessed biological sex from burial artifacts, whereas modern archaeology may use [[osteology]] to find biological sex, and [[isotope analysis]] to find origin ([[DNA]] sampling is usually not possible).&lt;ref&gt;SHANE MCLEOD. "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x/full Warriors and women: the sex ratio of Norse migrants to eastern England up to 900 AD]" 18 JUL 2011. Early Medieval Europe, Volume 19, Issue 3, pp. 332–53, August 2011. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x}} [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x/ Web] [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x/epdf PDF] Quote:"These results, six female Norse migrants and seven male, should caution against assuming that the great majority of Norse migrants were male, despite the other forms of evidence suggesting the contrary."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Halsall, "The Viking presence in England? The burial evidence reconsidered" in D. M. Hadley and J. Richards, eds, ''Cultures in Contact: Scandinavian Settlement in England in the Ninth and Tenth Centuries'' (Brepols: Turnhout, 2000), pp. 259–76. {{ISBN|2-503-50978-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The males buried during that period in a cemetery on the [[Isle of Man]] had mainly names of Norse origin, while the females there had names of indigenous origin. Irish and British women are mentioned in old texts on the founding of [[Iceland]], indicating that the Viking explorers were accompanied there by women from the British Isles who either came along voluntarily or were taken along by force. Genetic studies of the population in the Western Isles and [[Isle of Skye]] also show that Viking settlements were established mainly by male Vikings who mated with women from the local populations of those places.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

However, not all Viking settlements were primarily male. Genetic studies of the Shetland population suggest that family units consisting of Viking women as well as men were the norm among the migrants to these areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Highfield]], [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1487303/Vikings-who-chose-a-home-in-Shetland-before-a-life-of-pillage.html  "Vikings who chose a home in Shetland before a life of pillage", ''Telegraph'', 7 Apr 2005, accessed 12 Dec 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

This may be because areas like Shetland Island, being closer to Scandinavia, were more suitable targets for family migrations, while frontier settlements further north and west were more suitable for groups of unattached male colonizers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v95/n2/full/6800695a.html Heredity - Human migration: Reappraising the Viking Image&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of King [[Beorhtric of Wessex]] (786–802) three ships of "Northmen" landed at [[Isle of Portland|Portland Bay]] in [[Dorset]].

In 794, according to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', a small Viking fleet attacked a rich monastery at [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey|Jarrow]]. The Vikings met with stronger resistance than they had expected: their leaders were killed. The raiders escaped, only to have their ships beached at [[Tynemouth]] and the crews killed by locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Raid on Jarrow 794|publisher=Historic England|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1579441&amp;sort=2&amp;type=&amp;rational=a|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=asc794&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/776-99.html|title= ASC 794|publisher= Britannia Online|accessdate= 15 July 2012 | quote = [...] the heathen armies spread devastation among the Northumbrians, and plundered the monastery of King Everth at the mouth of the Wear.

The Vikings focused instead on Ireland and Scotland.

In 865 a group of hitherto uncoordinated bands of predominantly Danish Vikings joined together to form a large army and landed in East Anglia. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle described this force as the [[Great Heathen Army]] and went onto say that it was led by [[Ivar the Boneless]] and [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]].&lt;ref name=asc865&gt;

The army crossed the Midlands into Northumbria and captured York ([[Jorvik]]). In 871 the Great Heathen army was reinforced by what was known as the Great Summer Army, one of its leaders was [[Guthrum]].

Most of the English kingdoms, being in turmoil, could not stand against the Vikings, but King [[Alfred of Wessex]] defeated Guthrum's army at the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878. There followed the [[Treaty of Wedmore]] the same year and the [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]] in 886. These treaties formalised the boundaries of the English kingdoms and the Viking [[Danelaw]] territory, with provisions for peaceful relations between the English and the Vikings. Despite these treaties, conflict continued on and off. However, Alfred and his successors eventually drove back the Viking frontier and retook York.&lt;ref name=sawyer57&gt;{{Cite book |last= Sawyer |first= Peter |title= The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings |location= Oxford |year= 2001 |edition= 3rd |publisher= OUP |isbn= 0-19-285434-8 |pages= 57–70|quote= ..in 944 [[Edmund I|Edmund]] drove Olaf Sihtricsson and Ragnald Guthfitson from York, and proceeded to reduce all of Northumbria to his rule..}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
[[File:Kingdom of Mann and the Isles-en.svg|thumb|200px|Map of the [[Kingdom of the Isles]] and [[Earldom of Orkney]]]]
{{main article|Scandinavian Scotland|Norse-Gaels}}
The monastery at [[Iona]] on the west coast was first raided in 794, and had to be abandoned some fifty years later after several devastating attacks. While there are few records from the earliest period, it is believed that Scandinavian presence in Scotland increased in the 830s.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The isles to the north and west of Scotland were heavily colonised by Norwegian Vikings. [[Shetland]], [[Orkney]] and the [[Hebrides]] came under Norse control, sometimes as fiefs under the King of Norway, and at other times as separate entities under variously the [[Kingdom of the Isles|Kings of the Isles]], the [[Earldom of Orkney]] and the later [[Kingdom of the Isles#Later rulers of the Hebrides and of Mann|Kings of Mann and the Isles]]. Shetland and Orkney were the last of these to be incorporated into Scotland in as late as 1468.

===Wales===
Wales was not colonized by the Vikings significantly as in eastern England. The Vikings did, however, settle in small numbers in the south around [[St Davids]], [[Haverfordwest]], and the Gower. Place names such as [[Skokholm]], [[Skomer]], and [[Swansea]] remain as evidence of the Norse settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwp.enta.net/walhist.html Welsh place names.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220020051/http://www.gwp.enta.net/walhist.html |date=February 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vikings, however, were not able to set up a Viking state or control Wales, owing to the powerful forces of Welsh kings, and, unlike in Scotland, the aristocracy was relatively unharmed.

Nevertheless, following the successful Viking alliance with [[Britanny]] in 865, the Britons made their peace with the Danes, and a Viking/Welsh alliance in 878 defeated an Anglo-Saxon army from [[Mercia]]. Although the Welsh had been longtime enemies of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia, their relationship with the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex was somewhat warmer.&lt;ref name=yorke151&gt;{{Cite book |last=Yorke |first=Barbara |title=''Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England'' |location=London |year=1990 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd. |isbn=978-0-415-16639-3 |page=151}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of 893, for example, refers to Vikings being pursued by a combined force of West Saxons and north Welsh along the River Severn.&lt;ref name=lavelle23&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lavelle |first=Ryan |title=Alfred's Wars Sources and Interpretations of Anglo-Saxon Warfare in the Viking Age |publisher=Boydel Press |location=Woodbridge, Suffolk |isbn=978-1-84383-569-1 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined Anglo-Saxon and Welsh army eventually overtook the Vikings before defeating them at the [[Battle of Buttington]].&lt;ref name=horspool104&gt;Horspool.

The city of Swansea was founded by [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], King of Denmark, who by 1013 was King of the Danes, Anglo-Saxons and Norwegians. The English name for the town derives from {{lang-non|Sveinsey|}}, meaning either "Sweyn's island" or "Sweyn's inlet" (see [[Swansea]]). The neighboring [[Gower Peninsula]] has some place names of Norse origin. For example, [[Worm's Head]] is from {{lang-non|ormr|}}, the word for [[snake]] or [[dragon]], as the Vikings believed that the serpent-shaped island was a sleeping dragon. Some {{convert|20|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} west of [[Cardiff]] on the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] coast is the semi-flooded island of [[Tusker Rock]], which takes its name from Tuska, the Viking who established a settlement in the area.

===Cornwall===

The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' reported that ''heathen men'' (the Danes) raided [[Charmouth]], Dorset in 833 AD, then in 997 AD they destroyed the [[Dartmoor]] town of [[Lydford]], and from 1001 AD to 1003 AD they occupied the old Roman city of [[Exeter]].&lt;ref name=asc&gt;{{ws|[[s:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cornish were subjugated by King [[Æthelstan]], of England, in 936 and the border finally set at the [[River Tamar]]. However, the Cornish remained semi-autonomous until their annexation into England after the [[Norman Conquest]].&lt;ref name=wood146&gt;{{Cite book |first=Michael |last=Wood |year=2005 |title=In Search of the Dark Ages |publisher=BBC |location=London |isbn=978-0-563-52276-8 |pages=146–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
{{main article|History of Ireland (800–1169)|Early Scandinavian Dublin|Norse-Gaels}}
{{Campaignbox Viking wars in Ireland|state=expanded}}
[[File:Viking Ireland.png|thumb|right|Map showing areas of Norse control in Ireland in the 10th Century]]
The Vikings conducted extensive raids in Ireland and founded many towns, including [[Dublin]], [[Limerick]], [[Wexford]], [[Waterford]], [[Wicklow]], [[Arklow]] and [[Leixlip]]. Literature, crafts, and decorative styles in Ireland and Britain reflected Scandinavian culture. Vikings traded at Irish markets in Dublin. Excavations found imported fabrics from England, [[Byzantium]], [[Persia]], and central Asia. Dublin became so crowded by the 11th century that houses were built outside the town walls.

The Vikings pillaged monasteries on Ireland's west coast in 795, and then spread out to cover the rest of the coastline. The north and east of the island were most affected. During the first 40 years, the raids were conducted by small, mobile Viking groups. From 830 on, the groups consisted of large fleets of Viking ships. From 840, the Vikings began establishing permanent bases at the coasts. Dublin was the most significant settlement in the long term. The Irish became accustomed to the Viking presence and culture. In some cases they became allies and also intermarried.

In 832, a Viking fleet of about 120 ships under [[Turgesius]] invaded kingdoms on Ireland's northern and eastern coasts. Some believe that the increased number of invaders coincided with Scandinavian leaders' desires to control the profitable raids on the western shores of Ireland. During the mid-830s, raids began to push deeper into Ireland. Navigable waterways made this deeper penetration possible. After 840, the Vikings had several bases in strategic locations throughout Ireland.

In 838, a small Viking fleet entered the [[River Liffey]] in eastern Ireland, probably led by the chieftain Saxolb (''Soxulfr'') who was killed later that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncte.ie/viking/dubhist.htm A History of Viking Dublin], Viking Network Ireland.  Retrieved 14 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vikings set up a base, which the Irish called [[longphort]]s. This longphort would eventually become Dublin. After this interaction, the Irish experienced Viking forces for about 40 years. The Vikings also established longphorts in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]], and [[Wexford]]. The Vikings were driven out of Ireland for a short period in 902, but returned to Waterford in 914 to found what would become Ireland's first city. The other longphorts were soon re-occupied and developed into cities and towns.

The last major Irish battle involving Vikings was the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014, in which a large force from the pan-Viking world and their Irish allies opposed [[Brian Boru]], then the High King of Ireland and his forces, a small contingent of which were Viking defectors. The battle was fought in what is the now Dublin suburb of [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]] on Good Friday of that year. Boru, the Irish High King had allowed the Viking King of Dublin; Sigtrygg Silkbeard, one year to prepare for his coming assault. Silkbeard responded by offering the bed of his mother to several Viking lords from Scandinavia, Ireland and Britain. The savage mêlée between the heavily mailed Norse and the unarmoured, yet undaunted Gaels ended in a rout of the Vikings and their Irish allies. Careful accounts were taken by both sides during the battle, and thus many famous warriors sought each other out for personal combat and glory. High King Brian, who was nearly eighty, did not personally engage in the battle but retired to his tent where he spent the day in quiet prayer. The Viking [[Brodir and Ospak of Man|Brodir of Man]] chanced upon Brian's tent as he fled the field. He and a few followers seized the opportunity, and surprised the High King, killing the aged Brian before being captured. Brian's foster son [[Wolf the Quarrelsome]] later tracked down and dispatched Brodir by disembowelment. Wolf watching as Brodir marched and wound his own innards around the trunk of a large tree. The battle was fairly matched for most of the day and each side had great respect for the prowess of the other; however, in the end, the Irish forced the Norse to return to the sea. Many of the fleeing Vikings were drowned in the surf due to their heavy mail coats as they struggled for the safety of their longships; others were pursued and slain further inland. After the battle, Viking power was broken in Ireland forever, though many settled Norse remained in the cities and prospered greatly with the Irish through trade. With Brian dead, Ireland returned to the fractured kingdom it had once been, but was now cleared of further Viking predation.

===Normandy===
The name of Normandy itself denotes the Viking origin. After their settlement when it became known as "Northmannia" or Land of The Norsemen.

The Viking presence in Normandy began with raids into the territory of the Frankish Empire, from the middle of 9th century. Viking raids extended deep into the Frankish territory, and included the sacking of many prominent towns such as Rouen, Paris and the abbey at Jumieges. The inability of the Frankish king [[Charles the Bald]], and later [[Charles the Simple]], to prevent these Viking incursions forced them to offer vast payments of silver and gold to prevent any further pillage. These pay-offs were short lived and the Danish raiders would always return for more.

The [[Duchy of Normandy]] was created for the Viking leader [[Rollo]] after he had besieged Paris. In 911, Rollo entered [[vassalage]] to the king of the [[West Franks]] Charles the Simple through the [[Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte]]. This treaty made of Rollo the first Norman [[Count of Rouen]]. In addition, Rollo was to be baptized and marry Gisele, the illegitimate daughter of Charles. In exchange for his homage and fealty, Rollo legally gained the territory which he and his Viking allies had previously conquered.

The descendants of Rollo and his followers adopted the local [[Gallo-Romance languages]] and intermarried with the area's original inhabitants. They became the Normans&amp;nbsp;– a [[Norman French]]-speaking mixture of Scandinavians and indigenous [[Franks]] and [[Gauls]]. The language of Normandy heavily reflected the Danish influence, as many words (especially ones pertaining to seafaring) were borrowed from [[Old Norse]]&lt;ref&gt;RIDEL, ELISABETH, ''Les Vikings et les mots; l'apport de l'ancien scandinave à la langue française'', éditions Errance, 2009, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; or Old Danish.&lt;ref&gt;WOOD BREESE, LAUREN, ''The Persistence of Scandinavian Connections in Normandy in the Tenth and Early Eleventh Centuries'' , Viator, 8 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; More than the language itself, the [[Norman toponymy]] retains a strong Nordic influence. Nevertheless, only a few archaeological traces have been found: swords dredged out of the [[Seine river]] between its estuary and Rouen, the tomb of a female Viking at [[Pîtres]], the two [[Thor's hammer]]s at [[Saint-Pierre-de-Varengeville]]&lt;ref&gt;RIDEL (E.), ''Deux marteaux de Thor découverts en Normandie'' in Patrice Lajoye, ''Mythes et légendes scandinaves en Normandie'', OREP éditions, Cully, 2011, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently the horde of Viking coins at [[Saint-Pierre-des-Fleurs]].&lt;ref&gt;Cardon, T., en collaboration avec Moesgaard, J.-C., PROT (R.) et Schiesser, P., ''Revue Numismatique'', vol. 164, 2008, p. 21–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rollo's descendant [[William, Duke of Normandy]] (the ''Conqueror'') became [[King of England]] after he defeated [[Harold Godwinson]] and his army at the [[Battle of Hastings]] in October 1066. As king of England, he retained the fiefdom of Normandy for himself and his descendants. The kings of England made claim to Normandy, as well as their other possessions in France, which led to various disputes with the French. This culminated in the French confiscation of [[Gascony]] that precipitated what became known as the  [[Hundred Years' War]], in 1337.&lt;ref name=curry11&gt;{{Cite book |last=Curry |first=Anne |title=The Hundred Years' War: 1337–1453 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=Oxford |year=2002 |isbn=0-415-96863-1 |pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Francia and Middle Francia===
{{see also|Viking raids in the Rhineland}}
[[West Francia]] and [[Middle Francia]] suffered more severely than [[East Francia]] during the Viking raids of the 9th century. The reign of [[Charles the Bald]] coincided with some of the worst of these raids, though he did take action by the [[Edict of Pistres]] of 864 to secure a standing army of cavalry under royal control to be called upon at all times when necessary to fend off the invaders. He also ordered the building of fortified bridges to prevent inland raids.

Nonetheless, the [[Bretons]] allied with the Vikings and [[Robert the Strong|Robert]], the [[margrave]] of [[Neustria]], (a [[March (territorial entity)|march]] created for defence against the Vikings sailing up the [[Loire]]), and [[Ranulf I of Aquitaine|Ranulf of Aquitaine]] died in the [[Battle of Brissarthe]] in 865. The Vikings also took advantage of the civil wars which ravaged the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] in the early years of Charles' reign. In the 840s, [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|Pepin II]] called in the Vikings to aid him against Charles and they settled at the mouth of the [[Garonne]] as they did by the Loire. Two [[Duke of Gascony|dukes of Gascony]], [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] and [[William I of Gascony|William I]], died defending [[Bordeaux]] from Viking assaults. A later duke, [[Sancho Mitarra]], even settled some at the mouth of the [[Adour]] near Bayonne in an act presaging that of [[Charles the Simple]] and the [[Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte]] by which the Vikings were settled in Rouen, creating [[Normandy]] as a bulwark against other Vikings.

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Vikings raided the largely defenceless [[Frisians|Frisian]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] towns lying on the coast and along the rivers of the [[Low Countries]]. Although Vikings never settled in large numbers in those areas, they did set up long-term bases and were even acknowledged as lords in a few cases. They set up bases in [[Saint-Florent-le-Vieil]] at the mouth of the Loire, in [[Taillebourg, Charente-Maritime|Taillebourg]] on the mid Charente, also around [[Bayonne]] on the banks of the Adour, in [[Noirmoutier]] and obviously on the [[River Seine]] (Rouen) in what would become Normandy.

[[Antwerp]] was raided in 836. Later there were raids of Ghent, [[Kortrijk]], [[Tournai]], [[Leuven]] and the areas around the [[Meuse]] river, the [[Rhine]], the [[Rupel]] river and the tributaries of those rivers. Raids were conducted from bases established in [[Siege of Asselt|Asselt]], Walcheren, Wieringen and Elterberg (or Eltenberg, a small hill near [[Elten]]). In Dutch and Frisian historical tradition, the trading centre of [[Dorestad]] declined after Viking raids from 834 to 863; however, since no convincing Viking archaeological evidence has been found at the site ({{As of|2007|lc=y}}), doubts about this have grown in recent years.

One of the most important Viking families in the Low Countries was that of [[Rorik of Dorestad]] (based in [[Wieringen]]) and his brother Harald (based in [[Walcheren]]). Around 850, [[Lothair I]] acknowledged Rorik as ruler of most of Friesland. And again in 870 Rorik was received by [[Charles the Bald]] in [[Nijmegen]], to whom he became a vassal. Viking raids continued during this period. Harald's son Rodulf and his men were killed by the people of [[Oostergo]] in 873. Rorik died sometime before 882.

Buried Viking treasures consisting mainly of silver have been found in the Low Countries. Two such treasures have been found in Wieringen. A large treasure found in Wieringen in 1996 dates from around 850 and is thought perhaps to have been connected to Rorik. The burial of such a valuable treasure is seen as an indication that there was a permanent settlement in Wieringen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumkennis.nl/lp.rmo/museumkennis/i000412.html Vikingschat van Wieringen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718064223/http://www.museumkennis.nl/lp.rmo/museumkennis/i000412.html |date=2011-07-18 }} Retrieved 26 June 2008. (Dutch only)&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 879, [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia|Godfrid]] arrived in Frisian lands as the head of a large force that terrorised the Low Countries. Using [[Ghent]] as his base, they ravaged Ghent, [[Maastricht]], [[Liège]], [[Stavelot]], [[Prüm]], [[Cologne]], and [[Koblenz]]. Controlling most of Frisia between 882 and his death in 885, [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia|Godfrid]] became known to history as [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]]. His lordship over Frisia was acknowledged by [[Charles the Fat]], to whom he became a vassal. In the [[siege of Asselt]] in 882, the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]] sieged a Viking camp at Asselt in Frisia. Although the Vikings were not forced by arms to abandon their camp, they were compelled to come to terms in which their leader, Godfrid, was converted to Christianity. Godfrid was assassinated in 885, after which [[Gerolf of Holland]] assumed lordship and Viking rule of Frisia came to an end.

Viking raids of the Low Countries continued for over a century. Remains of Viking attacks dating from 880 to 890 have been found in [[Zutphen]] and [[Deventer]]. The last attacks took place in [[Tiel]] in 1006 and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in 1007.

===Iberian Peninsula===

[[File:Catoira 060905 033.JPG|thumb|Modern sculpture of a Viking in Catoira]]

Compared with the rest of Western Europe, the Iberian peninsula seems to have been little affected by Viking activity, either in the Christian north or the Muslim south.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Christys, &lt;i&gt;Vikings in the South&lt;/i&gt; (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), p. 65 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Our knowledge of Vikings in Iberia is mainly based on written accounts, many of which are much later than the events they purport to describe, and often also ambiguous about the origins or ethnicity of the raiders they mention.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Christys, &lt;i&gt;Vikings in the South&lt;/i&gt; (London: Bloomsbury, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; A little possible archaeological evidence has come to light,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Christys, &lt;i&gt;Vikings in the South&lt;/i&gt; (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; but research in this area is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.abdn.ac.uk/the-north/news/7686/ |title= Digging up the 'Spanish Vikings' |date=2014 |website= |publisher= University of Aberdeen |access-date= 22 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viking activity in the Iberian peninsula seems to have begun around the mid-ninth century as an extension of their raids on and establishment of bases in Frankia in the earlier ninth century, but although Vikings may have over-wintered there, there is as yet no evidence for trading or settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Christys, &lt;i&gt;Vikings in the South&lt;/i&gt; (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 5-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent and probably most significant event was a raid in 844, when Vikings entered the [[Garonne]] and attacked [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Asturias]]. They then proceeded south, raiding [[Lisbon]] and [[Seville]]. This [[Viking raid on Seville]] seems to have constituted a significant attack.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Christys, ''Vikings in the South'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 33-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

859–861 saw another spate of Viking raids, apparently by a single group. Despite some elaborate tales in late sources, little is known for sure about these attacks. After unsuccessful raids on both northern Iberia and al-Andalus, the Vikings seem also to have raided other Mediterranean targets—possibly but not certainly including [[Italy]], [[Alexandria]] and [[Constantinople]]−and perhaps over-wintering in Francia.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Christys, ''Vikings in the South'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 47-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for Viking activity in Iberia vanishes after the 860s, until the 960s-70s, when a range of sources including [[Dudo of Saint-Quentin]], [[Ibn Ḥayyān]], and [[Ibn Idhari|Ibn Idhārī]], along with a number of [[Charter|charters]] from Christian Iberia, while individually unreliable, together afford convincing evidence for Viking raids on Iberia in the 960s and 970s.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Christys, ''Vikings in the South'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 79-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenth- or eleventh-century fragments of mouse bone found in Madeira, along with mitocondrial DNA of Madeiran mice, suggests that Vikings also came to Madeira (bringing mice with them), long before the island was colonised by Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Christys, &lt;i&gt;Vikings in the South&lt;/i&gt; (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quite extensive evidence for minor Viking raids in Iberia continues for the early eleventh century in later narratives (including some Icelandic sagas) and in northern Iberian charters. As the Viking Age drew to a close, Scandinavians and Normans continued to have opportunities to visit and raid Iberia while on their way to the Holy Land for pilgrimage or crusade, or in connection with Norman conquests in the Mediterranean. Key examples in the saga literature are [[Sigurðr Jórsalafari]] (king of Norway 1103-1130) and [[Røgnvaldr kali Kolsson]] (d. 1158).&lt;ref&gt;Ann Christys, ''Vikings in the South'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 95-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy and Sicily===
{{main|Norman conquest of southern Italy}}
Around 860, [[Ermentarius of Noirmoutier]] and the [[Annals of St-Bertin]] provide contemporary evidence for Vikings based in Frankia proceeding to Iberia and thence to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Christys, &lt;i&gt;Vikings in the South&lt;/i&gt; (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), pp. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three or four eleventh-century Swedish [[Italy runestones|Runestones mention Italy]], memorialising warriors who died in 'Langbarðaland', the Old Norse name for southern Italy ([[Langobardia Minor]]). It seems clear that rather than being Normans, these men were [[Varangians|Varangian]] mercenaries fighting for Byzantium.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Jesch, ''Ships and Men in the Late Viking Age: The Vocabulary of Runic Inscriptions and Skaldic Verse'' (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2001), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varangians]] may first have been deployed as mercenaries in Italy against the Arabs as early as 936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ullidtz |first1=Per |title=1016 The Danish Conquest of England |date= |publisher=BoD&amp;nbsp;– Books on Demand |page=936}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later several Anglo-Danish and Norwegian nobles participated in the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy]]. [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardrada]], who later became [[king of Norway]], seems to have been involved in the Norman conquest of Sicily between 1038 and 1040,&lt;ref&gt;Judith Jesch, ''Ships and Men in the Late Viking Age: The Vocabulary of Runic Inscriptions and Skaldic Verse'' (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2001), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; under [[William Iron Arm|William de Hauteville]], who won his nickname ''Iron Arm'' by defeating the [[emir]] of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] in single combat, and a [[Lombards|Lombard]] contingent, led by [[Arduin the Lombard|Arduin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carr |first1=John |title=Fighting Emperors of Byzantium |date= |publisher=Pen and Sword |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hill |first1=Paul |title=The Norman Commanders: Masters of Warfare 911-1135 |date= |publisher=Pen and Sword |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edgar the Ætheling]], who left England in 1086, went there,&lt;ref&gt;''Anglo-Saxon Chronicles'', p. 217; Florence of Worcester, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Jarl [[Erling Skakke]] won his nickname after a battle against Arabs in Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Orkneyinga Saga, Anderson, Joseph, (Edinburgh: Edmonston and Douglas, 1873), FHL microfilm 253063., pp. 134, 139, 144–45, 149–51, 163, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many Anglo-Danish rebels fleeing [[William the Conqueror]], joined the Byzantines in their struggle against [[Robert Guiscard]], [[duke of Apulia]], in Southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Translation based on Chibnall (ed.), ''Ecclesiastical History'', vol. ii, pp. 203, 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-known [[Harald Hardrada]] would also serve the Byzantine emperor in Palestine as well as raiding North Africa, the Middle East as far east as Armenia, and the island of Sicily in the 11th century, as recounted in his saga in Snorri Sturluson's ''[[Heimskringla]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sturlason, Snorre.

Evidence for Norse ventures into Arabia and Central Asia can be found in [[runestone]]s erected in Scandinavia by the relatives of fallen Viking adventurers. Several of these refer to men who died in "[[Serkland]]" (possibly Arabia).&lt;ref&gt;Blöndel, Sigfus. ''The Varangians of Byzantium''. Trans. Benedikt S. Benedikz.

Meanwhile, in the Eastern Mediterranean the Norse (referred to as Rus') were viewed more as "merchant-warriors" who were primarily associated with trade and business.&lt;ref name=Gabriel1999/&gt; Indeed, one of the only detailed accounts of a Viking burial come from [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan|Ibn-Fadlan's]] account.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn-Fadlan.

The [[Varangians]] or [[Varyags]] (Russian, Ukrainian: Варяги, Varyagi) sometimes referred to as Variagians were Scandinavians who migrated eastwards and southwards through what is now Russia, [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]] mainly in the 9th and 10th centuries. Engaging in trade, colonization, piracy and mercenary activities, they roamed the river systems and portages of [[Garðaríki]], reaching and settling at the [[Caspian Sea]] and in Constantinople.

The real involvement of the Varangians came after they were asked by the Slavic tribes of the region to come and establish order, as those tribes were in constant warfare among each other ("Our country is rich and immense, but it is rent by disorder. Come and govern us and reign over us."&lt;ref&gt;Roesdahl, Else; ''The Vikings'': Edition 2, Penguin Group, 1999. p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;). The tribes were united and ruled under the leadership of [[Rurik]], a leader of a group of Varangians. Rurik had successfully been able to establish a set of trading towns and posts along the Volga and Dnieper Rivers, which were perfect for trade with the Byzantine Empire. Rurik's successors were able to conquer and unite the towns along the banks of the [[Volga]] and [[Dnieper]] Rivers, and establish the Rus' Khaganate. Despite the distinction of the Varangians from the local Slavic tribes at the beginning, by the 10th century, the Varangians began to integrate with the local community, and by the end of 12th century, a new people&amp;nbsp;— the Ruthenians, have emerged.

====Georgia====
{{See also|Caspian expeditions of the Rus'}}

Around 1036, Varangians appeared near the village of [[Bashi (Georgia)|Bashi]] on the [[Rioni River|Rioni]] River, to establish a permanent{{clarify|date=July 2018}} settlement of Vikings in Georgia. [[The Georgian Chronicles|''The Georgian Chronicles'']] described them as 3,000 men who had traveled from Scandinavia through present-day Russia, rowing down the [[Dnieper]] River and across the [[Black Sea]]. King [[Bagrat IV of Georgia|Bagrat IV]] welcomed them to Georgia and accepted some of them into the Georgian army; several hundred Vikings fought on Bagrat's side at the [[Battle of Sasireti]] in 1047.

Other Vikings continued westward, thereafter disappearing from history. Swedish researchers recently suggested that the story in the Georgian chronicle was about the Swedish expedition by the Viking chieftain [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled|Ingvar den Vittfarne]] (Ingvar the Far-Traveled), which features in many rune stones in mid-Sweden.

===Iceland===
{{Main article|Settlement of Iceland}}
[[File:LandnamabokManuscriptPage.jpg|thumb|l120px|right|A page from a skin manuscript of Landnámabók in the [[Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies]] in Reykjavík, Iceland]]

Iceland was discovered by [[Naddodd]], one of the first settlers on the [[Faroe Islands]], who was sailing from Norway to the Faroe Islands but got lost and drifted to the east coast of Iceland. Naddoddr named the country ''Snæland'' (Snowland). Swedish sailor Garðar Svavarsson also accidentally drifted to the coast of Iceland. He discovered that the country was an island and named it ''Garðarshólmi'' (literally ''Garðar's Islet'') and stayed for the winter at [[Húsavík]]. The first Scandinavian who deliberately sailed to ''Garðarshólmi'' was [[Flóki Vilgerðarson]], also known as Hrafna-Flóki (Raven-Flóki). Flóki settled for one winter at [[Barðaströnd]]. It was a cold winter, and when he spotted some [[drift ice]] in the [[fjord]]s he gave the island its current name, ''Ísland'' (Iceland).

Iceland was first settled around 870.&lt;ref name=Smith1995&gt;Smith K. 1995. "Landna'm: the settlement of Iceland in archaeological and historical perspective". ''World Archaeology'' 26:319–347.&lt;/ref&gt; The first permanent settler in Iceland is usually considered to have been a Norwegian chieftain named [[Ingólfr Arnarson]]. According to the story, he threw two carved pillars overboard as he neared land, vowing to settle wherever they landed. He then sailed along the coast until the pillars were found in the southwestern peninsula, now known as [[Reykjanesskagi]]. There he settled with his family around 874, in a place he named [[Reykjavík]] (Bay of Smokes) due to the geothermal steam rising from the earth. It is recognized, however, that Ingólfur Arnarson may not have been the first one to settle permanently in Iceland&amp;nbsp;— that may have been [[Náttfari]], a slave of [[Garðar Svavarsson]] who stayed behind when his master returned to Scandinavia.

===Greenland===
{{main article|History of Greenland#Norse settlement}}
In the year 985, Erik the Red was believed to have discovered Greenland after being exiled from Iceland for murder in 982. Three years later in 986, Erik the Red returned with 14 surviving ships (as 25 set out on the expedition).Two areas along Greenland's southwest coast were colonized by Norse settlers, including Erik the Red, around 986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Life and Times of Erik the Red |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngqYBgAAQBAJ |publisher=Mitchell Lane Publishers, Inc. |date=2009-09-01 |isbn=978-1-61228-882-6 |language=en |first=Earle Rice |last=Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 6 Viking Leaders You Should Know&amp;nbsp;— History Lists|url = http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/6-viking-leaders-you-should-know|website = HISTORY.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land was at best marginal for Norse pastoral farming. The settlers arrived during a warm phase, when short-season crops such as rye and barley could be grown. Sheep and hardy cattle were also raised for food, wool, and hides. Their main export was [[walrus]] ivory, which was traded for iron and other goods which could not be produced locally. Greenland became a dependency of the king of Norway in 1261. During the 13th century, the population may have reached as high as 5,000, divided between the two main settlements of ''[[Eastern Settlement|Eystribygð]]'' (Eastern Settlement) and ''[[Western Settlement|Vestribygð]]'' (Western Settlement). The organization of these settlements revolved mainly around religion, and they consisted of around 250 farms, which were split into approximately fourteen communities that were centered around fourteen churches,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, J. ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; one of which was a cathedral at [[Garðar, Greenland|Garðar]]. The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] diocese of Greenland was subject to the archdiocese of [[Nidaros]]. However, many bishops chose to exercise this office from afar. As the years wore on, the climate shifted (see [[Little Ice Age]]). In 1379, the northernmost settlement was attacked by the [[Skræling]]s (Norse word for Inuit).&lt;ref&gt;[http://personal.utulsa.edu/~marc-carlson/history/grontime2.html History of Medieval Greenland]&lt;/ref&gt; Crops failed and trade declined. The Greenland colony gradually faded away. By 1450, it had lost contact with Norway and Iceland and disappeared from all but a few Scandinavian legends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/features/societies/default.htm Why societies collapse]&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
{{main article|Norse colonization of the Americas}}
[[File:Christian-krohg-leiv-eriksson.jpg|right|thumb| ''Leif Erikson discovering America'' [[Christian Krohg]], 1893]]

A Norwegian ship's captain named [[Bjarni Herjólfsson]] first came across a part of the North American continent ca. 985 when he was blown off course sailing to Greenland from Iceland.  Subsequent expeditions from Greenland (some led by [[Leif Erikson]]) explored the areas to the west, seeking large timbers for building in particular (Greenland had only small trees and brush).  Regular activity from Greenland extended to [[Ellesmere Island]], [[Skraeling Island]] and [[Ruin Island]] for hunting and trading with [[Inuit]] groups. A short-lived settlement was established at L'Anse aux Meadows, located in the northern part of Newfoundland, Canada. Since 2012, [[Norse colonization of the Americas#Aftermath|five other potential settlements]] have been discovered ranging from [[Tanfield Valley]] in the north to [[Point Rosee]]&lt;ref name=SP2017&gt;{{cite news |title=Point Rosee, Codroy Valley, NL (ClBu-07) 2016 Test Excavations under Archaeological Investigation Permit #16.26|publisher=geraldpennyassociates.com, 42 pages|first1=Sarah|last1=Parcak|first2=Gregory|last2=Mumford|date=November 8, 2017 |access-date=June 19, 2018|url=http://vocm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PENNEY-2017-Point-Rosee-Codroy-Valley-NL-Test-Excavation-Report.pdf|quote=[The 2015 and 2016 excavations] found no evidence whatsoever for either a Norse presence or human activity at Point Rosee prior to the historic period. […] None of the team members, including the Norse specialists, deemed this area [Point Rosee] as having any traces of human activity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the south.

There is also evidence for Viking contact with Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gwyn, A History of the Vikings (2nd edn, Oxford, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The Vikings referred to them as Skraelings or ’uglies’. Fighting between the Natives and the Vikings did take place with the natives having the advanced weaponry of bows and arrows. However trade by barter did also take place between them. This contact led to a mutual amazement of two peoples toward each other. However, the conflict between these two groups led to the Vikings eventual evacuation of the area.

The Greenlanders called the new-found territory ''[[Vinland]]''.  It is unclear whether ''Vinland'' referred to in the traditionally thinking as Vínland (wine-land) or more recently as Vinland (meadow- or pasture-land). In any case, without any official backing, attempts at colonization by the Norse proved failures.  There were simply too many natives for the Greenlanders to conquer or withstand and they withdrew to Greenland.

===Svalbard===
{{further information|History of Svalbard}}

Vikings may have discovered Svalbard as early as the 12th century. Traditional Norse accounts exist of a land known as ''Svalbarð'' - literally "cold shores". (But this land might also have been [[Jan Mayen]], or a part of eastern [[Greenland]].) The Dutchman [[Willem Barents]] made the first indisputable discovery of Svalbard in 1596.

==Genetic evidence and implications==
Studies of [[genetic diversity]] have provided scientific confirmation to accompany archaeological evidence of Viking expansion. They additionally indicate patterns of ancestry, imply new migrations, and show the actual flow of individuals between disparate regions. However, attempts to determine historical population genetics are complicated by subsequent migrations and demographic fluctuations. In particular, the rapid migrations of the 20th century has made it difficult to assess what prior genetic states were.

Genetic evidence contradicts the common perception that Vikings were primarily pillagers and raiders. A [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1487303/Vikings-who-chose-a-home-in-Shetland-before-a-life-of-pillage.html news article] by [[Roger Highfield]] summarizes recent research and concludes that, as both male and female genetic markers are present, the evidence is indicative of colonization instead of raiding and occupying. However, this is also disputed by unequal ratios of male and female haplotypes (see below) which indicate that more men settled than women, an element of a raiding or occupying population.

===Mitochondrial and Y-chromosome Haplotypes===
Y-chromosome [[haplotype]]s serve as markers of paternal lineage much the same as [[mitochondrial DNA|mDNA]] represents the maternal lineage. Together, these two methods provide an option for tracing back a people's genetic history and charting the historical migrations of both males and females.

Often considered the purest remnants of ancient Nordic genetics, Icelanders trace 75–80% of their patrilineal ancestry to Scandinavia and 20–25% to Scotland and Ireland.&lt;ref name=Helgason2000&gt;Helgason A, Sigurethardottir S, Nicholson J, Sykes B, Hill EW, Bradley DG, Bosnes V, Gulcher JR, Ward R, Stefansson K. 2000. Estimating Scandinavian and Gaelic ancestry in the male settlers of Iceland. Am J Hum Genet 67:697–717.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodacre2005&gt;Goodacre S, Helgason A, Nicholson J, Southam L, Ferguson L, Hickey E, Vega E, Stefansson K, Ward R, Sykes B. 2005.Genetic evidence for a family-based Scandinavian settlement of Shetland and Orkney during the Viking periods. Heredity 95:129–135.&lt;/ref&gt; On the maternal side, only 37% is from Scandinavia and the remaining 63% is mostly Scottish and Irish.&lt;ref name=Goodacre2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Helgason2009&gt;Helgason A, Lalueza-Fox C, Ghosh S, Sigurdardottir S, Sampietro ML, Gigli E, Baker A, Bertranpetit J, Arnadottir L, Thornorsteinsdottir U, Stefansson K. 2009. Sequences from first settlers reveal rapid evolution in Icelandic mtDNA pool. PLoS Genet 5:e1000343&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland also holds one of the most well-documented lineage records which, in many cases, go back fifteen generations and at least 300 years. These are accompanied by one of the largest genetic records which have been collected by [[deCODE genetics]]. Together, these two records allow for a mostly reliable view of historical Scandinavian genetic structure although the genetics of Iceland are influenced by Norse-British migration as well as that directly from Scandinavia.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Common Y-Haplogroups====
[[Haplogroup I-M253]], also known as haplogroup I1, is the most common haplotype among Scandinavian males. It is present in 35% of males in Norway, Denmark and Sweden; 40% of males within Western Finland.&lt;ref name=Lappalainen2008&gt;Lappalainen, T., Laitinen, V., Salmela, E., Andersen, P., Huoponen, K., Savontaus, M.-L. and Lahermo, P. (2008). Migration Waves to the Baltic Sea Region. Annals of Human Genetics, 72: 337–348.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also prominent on the Baltic and North Sea coasts, but decreases further south.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Haplogroup R1b]] is another very common haplotype in all of Western Europe. However, it is not distinctly linked to Vikings or their expansion. There are indications that a mutant strand, R-L165, may have been carried to Great Britain by the Vikings,&lt;ref name=Moffat&gt;Moffat, Alistair; Wilson, James F. (2011). The Scots: a genetic journey. Birlinn. pp. 181–82, 192. {{ISBN|978-0-85790-020-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the topic is currently inconclusive.

====C1====
The mitochondrial [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|C1]] haplotype is primarily an East Asia-American haplotype that developed just prior to migration across the Bering sea.&lt;ref name=Starikovskaya2005&gt;Starikovskaya EB, Sukernik RI, Derbeneva OA, Volodko NV, Ruiz-Pesini E, Torroni A, Brown MD, Lott MT, Hosseini SH, Huoponen K, Wallace DC. 2005.

Beringian standstill and spread of Native American founders. PLoS One 2:e829.&lt;/ref&gt; This maternal haplotype, however, was found in several Icelandic samples.&lt;ref name=Helgason2000/&gt; While originally considered to be a 20th-century immigrant,&lt;ref name=Helgason2000/&gt; a more complete analysis has shown that this haplotype has been present in Iceland for at least 300 years and is distinct from other C1 lineages.&lt;ref name=Eben2010&gt;Ebenesersdóttir, S. S., Sigurðsson, Á., Sánchez-Quinto, F., Lalueza-Fox, C., Stefánsson, K. and Helgason, A. (2011), A new subclade of mtDNA haplogroup C1 found in icelanders: Evidence of pre-columbian contact?. Am. J. Phys. Anthropol., 144: 92–99.&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence indicates a likely genetic exchange back and forth between Iceland, Greenland, and [[Vinland]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Surname Histories and the Y-Haplotype====
There is evidence suggesting Y-Haplotypes may be combined with surname histories to better represent historical populations and prevent recent migrations from obscuring the historical record.&lt;ref name=Bowden2008&gt;Georgina R. Bowden, Patricia Balaresque, Turi E. King, Ziff Hansen, Andrew C. Lee, Giles Pergl-Wilson, Emma Hurley, Stephen J. Roberts, Patrick Waite, Judith Jesch, Abigail L. Jones, Mark G. Thomas, Stephen E. Harding, and Mark A. Jobling (2008).

Molecular Biol Evol 25(2): 301–309.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cys282Tyr===
Cys282Tyr (or C282Y) is a mutation in the [[HFE (gene)|HFE gene]] that has been linked to most cases of [[hereditary hemochromatosis]]. Genetic techniques indicate that this mutation occurred roughly 60–70 generations ago or between 600 and 800 CE, assuming a generation length of 20 years.&lt;ref name=Ajioka1997&gt;Ajioka RS, Jorde LB, Gruen JR et al. (1977). "Haplotype analysis of hemochromatosis: evaluation of different linkage-disequilibrium approaches and evolution of disease chromosomes". ''American Journal of Human Genetics 60'': 1439–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas1998&gt;Thomas W, Fullan A, Loeb DB, McClelland EE, Bacon BR, Wolff RK (1998). "A haplotype and linkage-disequilibrium analysis of the hereditary hemochromatosis gene region". ''Hum Genet 102'': 517–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The regional distribution of this mutation among European populations indicates that it originated in Southern Scandinavia and spread with Viking expansion.&lt;ref name=Milman2003&gt;Milman N, Pedersen P (2003). "Evidence that the Cys282Tyr mutation of the HFE gene originated from a population in Southern Scandinavia and spread with the Vikings". ''Clinical Genetics 64'': 36–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the timing of the mutation and subsequent population movements, C282Y is very prominent in Great Britain, Normandy, and Southern Scandinavia although C282Y has been found in almost every population that has been in contact with the Vikings.&lt;ref name=Milman2003/&gt;

'''Vsevolod Emilevich Meyerhold''' ({{lang-ru|Все́волод Эми́льевич Мейерхо́льд}}; born {{lang-de|Karl Kasimir Theodor Meierhold}}; {{OldStyleDate|9 February|1874|28 January}}{{spaced ndash}}2&amp;nbsp;February 1940) was a Russian and Soviet [[theatre director]], [[actor]] and [[theatrical producer]]. His provocative experiments dealing with physical being and [[symbol]]ism in an unconventional theatre setting made him one of the seminal forces in modern international theatre.
During the [[Great Purge]], Meyerhold was arrested, tortured and executed in February 1940.

==Life and work==

===Early life===
[[File:Grigoriev Meyerkhold.jpg|thumb|left|Vsevolod Meyerhold by [[Boris Grigoriev]], 1916]]
Vsevolod Meyerhold was born '''Karl Kasimir Theodor Meierhold''' in [[Penza]] on 28 January o.s. (9 February n.s.) 1874 to Russian-German wine manufacturer Emil Fyodorovich Meierhold and his Russian-Dutch wife, Alvina Danilovna (née van der Neese).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Braun|year=1998|title=Meyerhold: a Revolution in Theatre|publisher=A &amp; C Black|isbn=9781408148808|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYnaFmCj_QIC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=Alvina+Emil+Meyerhold&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Alvina%20Emil%20Meyerhold&amp;f=false|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest of eight children.&lt;ref name="Pitches_4"&gt;Pitches (2003, pg. 4)&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing school in 1895, Meierhold studied law at [[Moscow University]] but never completed his degree. He was torn between studying theatre or a career as a violinist. However, he failed his audition to become the second violinist in the University orchestra and in 1896 joined the [[Moscow Philharmonic Dramatic School]].&lt;ref name="Pitches_4"/&gt;

On his 21st birthday, he converted from [[Lutheranism]] to [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christianity]] and accepted "Vsevolod" as an Orthodox Christian name (after the Russian writer [[Vsevolod Garshin]], whose prose Meyerhold loved).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sovsekretno.ru/magazines/article/1243 |title=P. V. Merkuviev reminiscing about his grandfather — V. E. Meyerhold|publisher=Sovershenno Sekretno|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Meyerhold began acting in 1896 as a student of the [[Russian Academy of Theatre Arts|Moscow Philharmonic Dramatic School]] under the guidance of [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]], co-founder with [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Konstantin Stanislavsky]] of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]]. At the MAT, Meyerhold played 18 roles, such as Vasiliy Shuiskiy in ''[[Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich]]'' and Ivan the Terrible in ''[[The Death of Ivan the Terrible]]'' (both by [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy|Aleksey Tolstoy]]). In 1898, in the first successful production of [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov's]] first play, ''[[The Seagull]]'', Meyerhold played the lead male role,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McSmith |first1=Andy |title=Fear and the Muse Kept Watch, The Russian Masters - from Akhmatova and Pasternak to Shostakovich and Eisenstein - Under Stalin |date=2015 |publisher=The New Press |location=New York |isbn=978-1-59558-056-6 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposite Chekhov's future wife, [[Olga Knipper]].

After leaving the MAT in 1902, wanting to break free of the highly naturalistic 'missing fourth wall' productions of Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko, Meyerhold participated in a number of theatrical projects, as both a director and actor. Each project was an arena for experiment and creation of new staging methods. Meyerhold was one of the most fervent advocates of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] in theatre, especially when he worked as the chief producer of the [[Vera Komissarzhevskaya]] theatre in 1906–1907. He was invited back to the MAT around this time to pursue his experimental ideas.
[[File:Alexander Y Golovin Portrait of Meyerhold.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aleksandr Golovin (artist)|Alexander Golovin]]'s portrait of Meyerhold.]]
Meyerhold continued theatrical innovation during the decade 1907–1917, while working with the imperial theatres in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. He introduced classical plays in an innovative manner, and staged works of controversial contemporary authors like [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Zinaida Gippius]], and [[Alexander Blok]]. In these plays, Meyerhold tried to return acting to the traditions of ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'', rethinking them for the contemporary theatrical reality. His theoretical concepts of the "conditional theatre" were elaborated in his book ''[[On Theatre]]'' in 1913.

=== Career under communism ===
On the day when the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] broke out - on 25 February, under the old style calendar then used in Russia - Meyerhold's production of ''Masquerade'' by [[Mikhail Lermontov]] had a dress rehearsal at the [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]], in front of an audience that included the poet [[Anna Akhmatova]]. That evening has been described as "the last act of the tragedy of the old regime, when the Petersburg elite went to enjoy themselves at this splendidly luxurious production in the midst of the chaos and confusion.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reeder |first1=Roberta |title=Anna Akhmatova, Poet &amp; Prophet |date=1995 |publisher=Allison &amp; Busby |location=London |isbn=0 85031 998 6 |pages=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergei Eisenstein, who was then a teenager but would later be a world-renowned film director, desperately wanted to see the production, having heard that it featured clowns, but having made his way across the city that was in the throes of a revolution was disappointed to discover that the Alexandrinsky was closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McSmith |title=Fear and the Muse |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Meyerhold was one of the first prominent Russian artists to welcome the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] - and one of only five out of 120 who accepted an invitation to meet the new People's Commissar for Enlightenment, [[Anatoly Lunacharsky|Anatoly Luncharsky]] in November 1917. (Among the others were the poets Alexamder Blok and [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]].) He joined the [[Bolshevik Party]] in 1918, narrowly escaping execution when he was caught on the wrong side of the battle lines during the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McSmith |title=Fear and the Muse |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became an official of the Theatre Division (TEO) of the [[People's Commissariat for Education|Commissariat of Education and Enlightenment]]. In 1918–1919, Meyerhold formed an alliance with [[Olga Kameneva]], the head of the Division. Together, they tried to radicalize Russian theatres, effectively nationalizing them under Bolshevik control. Meyerhold came down with [[tuberculosis]] in May 1919 and had to leave for the south. In his absence, the head of the Commissariat, [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], secured [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s permission to revise government policy in favor of more traditional theatres and dismissed Kameneva in June 1919.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert Leach and Victor Borovsky. ''A History of Russian Theatre'', Cambridge University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-521-43220-0}} p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; 
After returning to Moscow, Meyerhold founded his own theatre in 1920, which was known from 1923 as the [[Meyerhold Theatre]] until 1938. Meyerhold confronted the principles of theatrical [[academism]], claiming that they are incapable of finding a common language with the new reality. Meyerhold's methods of [[Constructivism (art)|scenic constructivism]] and [[circus]]-style effects were used in his most successful works of the time. Some of these works included [[Nikolai Erdman]]'s ''The Mandate'', Mayakovsky's ''[[Mystery-Bouffe]]'', [[Fernand Crommelynck]]'s ''[[Le Cocu magnifique]]'' (''The Magnanimous Cuckold'') and [[Aleksandr Sukhovo-Kobylin]]'s ''Tarelkin's Death''. Mayakovsky collaborated with Meyerhold several times, and was said to have written ''[[The Bedbug]]'' especially for him; Meyerhold continued to stage Mayakovsky's productions even after the latter's [[suicide]].

=== Acting techniques ===
The actors participating in Meyerhold's productions acted according to the principle of ''biomechanics'' (only distantly related to the [[biomechanics|present]] scientific use of the term), the system of actor training that was later taught in a special school created by Meyerhold.
Meyerhold's acting technique had fundamental principles at odds with the American [[method acting|method actor]]'s conception. While method acting melded the character with the actor's own personal memories to create the character's internal motivation, Meyerhold connected psychological and physiological processes. He had actors focus on learning gestures and movements as a way of expressing emotion physically. Following Konstantin Stanislavski's lead, he said that the emotional state of an actor was inextricably linked to his physical state (and vice versa), and that one could call up emotions in performance by practicing and assuming poses, gestures, and movements. He developed a number of body expressions that his actors would use to portray specific emotions and characters. (Stanislavski was also at odds with Method acting, because like Meyerhold, his approach was psychophysical.)

=== His influence ===
Meyerhold gave initial boosts to the stage careers of some of the most distinguished comic actors of the USSR, including [[Sergey Martinson]], [[Igor Ilyinsky]] and [[Erast Garin]]. His landmark production of [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' (1926) was described as the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Energetic, mischievous, charming Ilyinsky left his post to the nervous, fragile, suddenly freezing, grotesquely anxious Garin. Energy was replaced by trance, the dynamic with the static, happy jesting humour with bitter and glum satire.&lt;ref&gt;Konstantin L. Rudnitsky. ''Meyerhold the Director''. Moscow, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meyerhold also gave a start to his one time assistant of "[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]" [[Matvey Dubrovin]], who later created his own [[Theater of Youth Creativity|theater]] in [[Leningrad]].

In autumn 1921, Meyerhold was appointed head of the State Higher Theatre Workshops, in Moscow, where one of his first students was Sergei Eisenstein, who later wrote

&lt;blockquote&gt;The God-like, incomparable Meyerhold, I beheld him then for the first time and I was to worship him all my life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But they fell out, apparently because Eisenstein failed to treat the older man with sufficient deference, for which he was, as he put it, "expelled from the Gates of Heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McSmith |title=Fear and the Muse |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his films, Eisenstein used actors who worked in Meyerhold's tradition.  He also cast actors based on what they looked like and their expression, and followed Meyerhold's stylized acting methods. In ''[[Strike (1925 film)|Strike]]'', for instance, the bourgeois are always obese, drinking, eating, and smoking, whereas the workers are more athletic.
For the original production of ''The Bedbug'', in February 1929, Meyerhold hired the young [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] as a pianist. Many years later, Shostakovich reputedly recalled: "It's impossible to imagine now how popular Meyerhold was. Everyone knew him, even those who had no interest or connection with the theatre or art. In the circus, clowns always made jokes about Meyerhold. They go for instant laughs in the circus, and they wouldn't sing ditties about people the audience wouldn't recognise immediately. They even used to sell combs called Meyerhold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Volkov |first1=Solomon |title=Testimony, The Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich |date=1979 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |location=London |pages=163–164}} (the extent to which this book is a genuine memoir is disputed)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repression ===
In the early 1930s, [[Joseph Stalin]] launched a campaign to bring soviet artists to heel, and compel them all to observe the rules of 'socialist realism', which precluded [[avant-garde]] art and experimentation, and any art form reckoned to be 'formalist', in that the artist had paid more attention to the form of a work than to its political message. After Shostakovich had been singled out as being guilty of 'formalism', in January 1936, Meyerhold evidently surmised that he would soon be a target, and in March delivered a talk entitled "Meyer Against Meyerholdism" in which he said - reportedly to 'thunderous applause' - that "the path to simplicity is not an easy one. Each artist goes at his own pace, and they must not lose their distinctive way of walking...Soviet subject matter is often a smoke screen to conceal mediocrity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McSmith |title=Fear and the Muse |pages=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in April 1937, his wife, the actress Zinaida Raikh, wrote Stalin a long letter alleging that her husband was the victim of a conspiracy by [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] and former members of the disbanded [[Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]]. The letter was not answered. In December 1937, Stalin's crony, [[Lazar Kaganovich]] went to a production at the Meyerhold Theatre, and walked out in disgust. The theatre was closed, by order of the Politburo, on 7 January 1938, on the grounds that "throughout its entire existence, the Meyerhold Theatre has been unable to free itself from thoroughly bourgeois Formalist positions.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McSmith |title=Fear and the Muse |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;  his works were proclaimed antagonistic and alien to the Soviet people.

===Arrest and death===
[[File:MeyerholdMug.jpg|thumb|200px|Meyerhold's mugshot, taken at the time of his arrest by Soviet police]]
The ailing Stanislavsky, who was the director of an opera theatre now known as [[Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Moscow Academic Music Theatre|Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Music Theatre]], invited Meyerhold to be his assistant - an invitation that surprised many in Moscow, given their long standing artistic differences. Stanislavsky died soon afterwards, in August 1938. His dying wish was "Take care of Meyerhold; he is my sole heir in the theatre - here or anywhere else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Braun |first1=Edward |title=The Theatre of Meyerhold, Revolution on the Modern Stage |date=1986 |publisher=Methuen |location=London |isbn=0 413 41120 6 |page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyerhold directed his theatre for nearly a year, and was engaged in a production of an opera by [[Sergei Prokofiev]], when he was instructed that he was to choreograph a spectacle in Leningrad, involving 30,000 athletes. On 17 June 1939, he addressed a conference of theatre directors, in the presence of [[Andrey Vyshinsky|Andrei Vyshinsky]], the state prosecutor who had presided over the infamous Moscow show trials. His speech was not reported in the soviet press, giving rise to a report that he had declared, defiantly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If what you have been doing with the soviet theatre recently is what you call anti-formalism, if you consider what is now taking place on the stages of the best theatres in Moscow as an achievement of the soviet theatre, then I would prefer to be what you consider a formalist....In hunting formalism, you have eliminated art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gorchakov |first1=Nikolai A. |title=The Theatre in Soviet Russia |date=1957 |publisher=Columbia Press |location=New York |pages=363–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is from a version of the speech written up later by the emigre musician Yuri Yelagin, from notes he said that he made at the conference - but its accuracy is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Braun |title=The Theatre of Meyerhold |pages=268–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the speech, he returned to Leningrad, and was arrested on arrival, on 20 June 1939. Shortly afterwards, intruders broke into his flat and repeatedly stabbed his wife, [[Zinaida Reich|Zinaida Raikh]], who died from her injuries. Taken to NKVD headquarters in Moscow, Meyerhold broke down and confessed to being a British and Japanese spy. In his final days, he wrote a letter to the head of the soviet government [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], which was retained in police files, where it was discovered after the collapse of communism by the journalist [[Vitaly Shentalinsky]]. In it, he wrote:

{{quote|The investigators began to use force on me, a sick 65-year-old man. I was made to lie face down and beaten on the soles of my feet and my spine with a rubber strap. They sat me on a chair and beat my feet from above, with considerable force... For the next few days, when those parts of my legs were covered with extensive internal hemorrhaging, they again beat the red-blue-and-yellow bruises with the strap and the pain was so intense that it felt as if boiling water was being poured on these sensitive areas. I howled and wept from the pain. They beat my back with the same rubber strap and punched my face, swinging their fists from a great height ... The intolerable physical and emotional pain caused my eyes to weep unending streams of tears, Lying face down on the floor, I discovered that I could wriggle, twist and squeal like a dog when its master whips it ... When I lay down on the cot and fell asleep, after 18 hours of interrogation, in order to go back in an hour's time for more, I was woken up by my own groaning and because I was jerking about like a patient in the last stages of typhoid fever ... "death, oh most certainly, death is easier than this!" the interrogated person says to himself. I began to incriminate myself in the hope that this, at least, would lead quickly to the scaffold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shentalinsky |first1=Vitaly |title=The KGB's Literary Archive |date=1995 |publisher=John Crowfoot |location=Harvill |isbn=1 86046 072 0 |pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was sentenced to death by firing squad on 1 February 1940, and executed the next day. The Soviet Supreme Court cleared him of all charges in 1955, during the first wave of [[de-Stalinization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Leach|title=Makers of Modern Theatre: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GuMK-X0p6F0C&amp;pg=PA93|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Meyerhold married his first wife, Olga Munt, in 1896 and together they had three daughters. He later met the actress Zinaida Raikh when she began studying with him.  They fell in love and he divorced his wife; Raikh was already divorced and had two children of her own.  They married in 1922 or 1924.
