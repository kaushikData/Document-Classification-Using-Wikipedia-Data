== Plot ==
{{See also|2012 Benghazi attack}}
In 2012, [[Benghazi]], [[Libya]] is named one of the most dangerous places in the world, and countries have pulled their diplomatic offices out of the country in fear of an attack by militants. The [[United States]], however, still has a diplomatic compound (not an official consulate) open in the city. Less than a mile away is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] outpost called "The Annex", which is protected by a team of [[Private military company|private military contractors]] from [[Global Response Staff]] (GRS). New to the detail is Jack Silva, who arrives in Benghazi and is picked up by [[Tyrone S. Woods|Tyrone "Rone" Woods]], commander of the GRS team and a personal friend of Silva. Arriving at the Annex, Silva is introduced to the rest of the GRS team and the CIA [[Chief of Station]], who constantly gives the team strict reminders to never engage the citizens.

The [[U.S. Ambassador to Libya|U.S. Ambassador]] [[J. Christopher Stevens|Chris Stevens]] arrives in Benghazi to maintain diplomatic connections amidst the political and social chaos. Despite warnings, Stevens decides to stay at the [[Special Mission Unit|Special Mission]] with limited protection from five [[Diplomatic Security Service|Diplomatic Security]] (DS) agents, principally, Scott Wickland and Dave Ubben, along with guards hired from the local [[February 17th Martyrs Brigade]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; militia, nicknamed "17-Feb". On the morning of the eleventh anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks]], Stevens notices suspicious men taking pictures of the compound and notifies his security detail. Back at the Annex, Silva finds out that his wife is pregnant.

That night, a group of militants from [[Ansar al-Sharia (Libya)|Ansar al-Sharia]] assault the compound. The 17-Feb guards quickly surrender their posts, allowing the attackers easy access to the Special Mission compound. Wickland takes Stevens and [[Sean Smith (diplomat)|Smith]], an IT specialist, into the safe room. Unable to breach the safe room, the attackers set the building on fire hoping to burn the men out. Wickland is able to escape but loses both Stevens and Smith. At the Annex, the GRS team desperately wants to go to the compound to help, but the Chief refuses, fearing that the team's departure would expose the Annex. However, the team dispatches to the compound and meets up with the DS agents. Silva and Woods go into the building to try to find Stevens and Smith, but are only able to find Smith's body. The DS team from the compound retreats to the Annex; but after Wickland goes in the wrong direction, they are followed back to the Annex. Later, the GRS team also retreats to the Annex.

Knowing an attack by the militants is imminent, the CIA staff of the Annex makes several desperate calls for help. The only help they can get is from [[Glen Doherty|Glen "Bub" Doherty]], a GRS officer in [[Tripoli]], who forms a team including two [[Delta Force|Delta]] operators that fly to Benghazi after several delays. Meanwhile, the GRS team fends off the militants as they try to breach the Annex perimeter. After repelling the largest attack wave, the Annex receives word from [[Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance|ISR]] that help is en route.

The Tripoli GRS reinforcements arrive and begin preparing the CIA and DS staff to depart for the airport. The militants launch a mortar attack in which Ubben and Geist are wounded; Geist's left arm is partially severed. Woods rushes to aid Geist and is killed by another mortar round. Doherty is also killed when a third mortar detonates directly in front of him.

With the GRS team compromised, and the Annex now vulnerable, the remaining GRS operators watch as a convoy of vehicles rolls toward the Annex. Fearing the worst, the operators prepare to make a final stand, until it is revealed that the convoy is an element of the [[Libya Shield Force]] militia escorting the GRS reinforcements. They also find out that Stevens was found behind the compound, but was pronounced dead at the hospital.

At the airport, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] staff and the wounded Geist board the plane to Tripoli while the remainder of the GRS team waits for the next plane with the bodies of Stevens, Smith, Woods and Doherty. Closing titles reveal that all of the surviving members of the Annex security team received contractor medals in a private ceremony and have since retired from the GRS team and live with their families (Geist was able to save his arm after several surgeries).

Likely due to a boost from the [[2016 U.S. Presidential Election]], the film made $40 million in DVD and Blu-ray sales by August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2016/08/05/michael-bays-13-hours-gets-huge-sales-boost-as-election-nears.html |title=Michael Bay's '13 Hours' gets huge sales boost as election nears |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date= |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michael-bays-benghazi-film-gets-916588 |title=Michael Bay's Benghazi Film Gets Trump Bump in Home Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
''13 Hours'' grossed $52.9 million in North America and $16.5 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $69.4 million, against a production budget of $50 million,&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt; making it Michael Bay's lowest-grossing directorial film to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Director&amp;id=michaelbay.htm | title=Michael Bay Movie Box Office Results | website=Box Office Mojo | accessdate=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was projected to earn around $20 million in its four-day Martin Luther King weekend debut. It faced competition from fellow newcomer ''[[Ride Along 2]]'', as well as holdovers ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-movie-projector-20160113-story.html|title='Ride Along 2' is likely to take over No. 1 spot at box office this weekend|first=Ryan|last=Faughnder|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other films in a similar vein that had opened on the MLK weekend in previous years, ''[[American Sniper]]'' ($107.2 million in 2015) and ''[[Lone Survivor (film)|Lone Survivor]]'' ($37.8 million in 2014), found success, although they had faced weaker competition, and were considered less politically divisive.&lt;ref name="THRbox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-preview-13-hours-855167|title=Box-Office Preview: Michael Bay's Benghazi Movie '13 Hours' Could Be Politically Divisive|first=Pamela|last=McClintock|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 12, 2016|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the film could outperform expectations if it was buoyed by waves of patriotism.&lt;ref name="THRbox" /&gt; The film made $900,000 from 1,995 theaters during its Thursday previews and $16.2 million in its opening weekend, finishing fourth at the box office.&lt;ref name="Thursday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/01/ride-along-2-begins-to-zoom-in-thursday-previews-box-office-1201683644/ |title=

=== Critical response ===
''13 Hours'' received mixed reviews from critics, though some viewed it as a welcomed tame effort from Michael Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/13-hours-the-secret-soldiers-of-benghazi-review-dramatized-look-at-the-deadly-2012-benghazi-attack-1.11328669|title=‘13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi’ review: Dramatized look at the deadly 2012 Benghazi attack|first=Rafer|last=Guzmán|work=Newsday}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cinemalogue.com&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.cinemalogue.com/2016/01/15/13-hours-the-secret-soldiers-of-benghazi/ | title =13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi | last1 = Jorgenson | first1 =Todd | author-link1 = | last2 = | first2 = | author-link2 = | date =January 16, 2016 | year = | website =Cinemalogue.com | publisher = | access-date =January 18, 2016 | subscription = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theyoungfolks.com/review/13-hours-the-secret-soldiers-of-benghazi-michael-bay/70719|title=Movie Review: '13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi'&amp;nbsp;– The Young Folks|work=The Young Folks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatguysatthemovies.com/13-hours-the-secret-soldiers-of-benghazi-movie-review/|title=Fat Guys at the Movies - ’13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi’ Movie Review|work=Fat Guys at the Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tri-cityherald.com/entertainment/movies-news-reviews/mr-movie/article54596165.html|title=Mr. Movie|work=tri-cityherald}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 50% based on 210 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 5.5/10 against an audience approval rating of 82%. The site's consensus reads, "''13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi'' is a comparatively mature and restrained effort from Michael Bay, albeit one that can't quite boast the impact its fact-based story deserves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/13_hours_the_secret_soldiers_of_benghazi/ |title=''13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi'' (2016) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 48 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/13-hours-the-secret-soldiers-of-benghazi |title=''13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi'' Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CY0f1EJUAAAeatD.png |title=CinemaScore |publisher=cinemascore.com |via=[[Twitter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thursday /&gt;

Soren Andersen, writing for ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', gave the film 3 stars out of 4, criticizing the lack of distinctive characters but ultimately summarizing ''13 Hours'' as "engrossing" and "a ground-level depiction of heroism in the midst of the fog of war".&lt;ref name="seattlereview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/13-hours-a-gripping-look-at-what-happened-in-benghazi/?|title=13 Hours: a gripping look at what happened in Benghazi|first=Soren|last=Andersen|work=[[Seattle Times]]|date=January 14, 2016|accessdate=January 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Roeper]] similarly praised ''13 Hours'' in his review for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. Although he lamented the script, Roeper found the film to be a "solid action thriller with well-choreographed battle sequences and strong work from the ensemble cast".&lt;ref name="roeperreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.suntimes.com/entertainment/post/13-hours-secret-soldiers-benghazi-michael-bay-keeps-focus-fight-fighters/|title=’13 HOURS: THE SECRET SOLDIERS OF BENGHAZI': MICHAEL BAY KEEPS FOCUS ON FIGHT AND FIGHTERS|author=[[Richard Roeper]]|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=January 14, 2016|accessdate=January 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Roeper's review, ''[[New York Daily News]]''{{'}} Joe Dziemianowicz was less receptive towards the script, but applauded the film's focus on the real-life attack, summarizing: "War is gritty here, not glamorous... &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Michael Bay]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; delivers a gripping, harrowing, and heartfelt film."&lt;ref name="dailynews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/michael-bay-13-hours-gripping-benghazi-story-article-1.2495477|title=Movie review: Michael Bay's ‘13 Hours’ is a gripping Benghazi story with a ripped John Krasinski|first=Joe|last=Dziemianowicz|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=January 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a mixed review, Inkoo Kang of [[TheWrap]] praised ''13 Hours'' for its action scenes, but panned Bay's direction as "myopic". She writes, "''13 Hours'' is the rare Michael Bay movie that wasn't made with teenage boys in mind. But that doesn't make his latest any less callously juvenile."&lt;ref name=wrapreview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/13-hours-review-john-krasinski-james-badge-dale-pablo-schreiber/|title=’13 Hours’ Review: Michael Bay's Benghazi Tale Has Way More Bullets Than Brains|first=Inkoo|last=Kang|website=[[TheWrap]]|date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=January 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsey Bahr of the [[Associated Press]] was critical of the film's direction and cinematography, and found the screenplay to be confusing.&lt;ref name="abcreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/review-13-hours-thrilling-video-game-36279697|title=Review: '13 Hours' Is Thrilling, but Too Video Game-Like|first=Lindsey|last=Bahr|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=January 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''[[The Economist]]'' described the film as "a sleek, poorly scripted and largely meaningless film".&lt;ref name=M.S.R. /&gt;

=== Libyan response ===
The film caused controversy in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2015/10/20/hollywood-benghazi-film-sparks-controversy-inside-libya/ Hollywood Benghazi film sparks controversy inside Libya] New York Post&lt;/ref&gt; Many Libyans believed it ignored the contributions of local people who helped save the US ambassador.&lt;ref name="angry libyans"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/22/michael-bay-13-hours-the-secret-soldiers-of-benghazi-libyan-politicians-bloggers-criticism-social-media Angry Libyans slam Michael Bay's Benghazi attack thriller] The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; Libya's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Salah Belnaba, denounced the film's portrayal of the Libyan people and described it as "fanatical and ignorant."&lt;ref name="sparking anger"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hollywood-benghazi-film-sparking-anger-inside-libya/ Hollywood Benghazi film sparking anger inside Libya] CBS News&lt;/ref&gt;
Libya's Culture and Information Minister, Omar Gawaari, also criticized the film saying: "the movie shows the US contractors who actually failed to secure the ambassador ... as heroes", adding that Michael Bay “turned America’s failure to protect its own citizens in a fragile state into a typical action movie all about American heroism”.&lt;ref name="angry libyans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sparking anger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/arabic/artandculture/2015/10/151020_libya_film_controversy فيلم حول الهجوم على القنصلية الأمريكية في بنغازي يثير جدلا داخل ليبيا] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accolades ===
At the [[89th Academy Awards]], ''13 Hours'' received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/24/la-la-land-equals-record-for-most-oscar-nominations|title=La La Land equals record for most Oscar nominations|date=January 24, 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Greg P. Russell]] (one of the four nominees from the film) had his nomination rescinded when it was discovered that he had contacted voters for the award by telephone in violation of campaigning regulations.&lt;ref name=award /&gt;

== Historical accuracy ==
The film's historical accuracy has been disputed. In the film's most controversial scene, the CIA chief in Benghazi (identified only as "Bob") tells the military contractors there, who seek permission to go defend the embassy, to "stand down", thus denying them permission. The real-life CIA chief stated that there was no stand-down order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/movies/former-benghazi-cia-chief-slams-13-hours-secret-soldiers-benghazi-n497506|title=Former Benghazi CIA Chief Slams '13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi'|first=Corky|last=Siemaszko|publisher=NBC News| accessdate =January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His statement was echoed by the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee's finding that there was "no evidence of intentional delay or obstruction by the Chief of Base or any other party".&lt;ref name=Beauchamp&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/15/10774928/13-hours-benghazi-michael-bay|title=Michael Bay's 13 Hours promotes some of the worst Benghazi conspiracy theories|first=Zack|last=Beauchamp|date=January 15, 2016|work=Vox| accessdate =January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no help was sent, even though officials at the highest levels  found out about the attack within the first few hours out of the 13.  Also, ''[[National Review]]'' commentator [[David A. French|David French]] argues that the Senate committee cited above found plenty of evidence of the "stand down" order in the form of personal testimony from multiple witnesses. It just chose to rule that the contrary testimony outweighed it.&lt;ref name="French"&gt;{{cite web |title=13 Hours: Of Course There's Evidence of a ‘Stand-Down  Order’ in Benghazi |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/429855/13-hours-yes-there-evidence-stand-down-order-benghazi |first=David |last=French |publisher=National Review |date=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kris "Tanto" Paronto, a CIA contractor who was involved in action during the event said, "We were told to 'stand down'. Those words were used verbatim—100 percent. If the truth of it affects someone's political career? Well, I'm sorry. It happens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = New Benghazi movie reignites ‘stand-down’ order debate|url = http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/benghazi-movie-stand-down-order-debate-217622|website = POLITICO|accessdate = January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA base chief portrayed in the film has directly contradicted Paronto's claims, saying "There never was a stand-down order... At no time did I ever second-guess that the team would depart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daly|first=Matthew|title=AP FACT CHECK: Benghazi movie misstates some facts|url=http://wtop.com/movies/2016/01/ap-fact-check-benghazi-movie-misstates-some-facts/|publisher=WTOP (Associated Press)|date=January 20, 2016|access-date=May 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415024226/http://wtop.com/movies/2016/01/ap-fact-check-benghazi-movie-misstates-some-facts/|archive-date=April 15, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also disputed is the film's portrayal that air support was denied. A House Armed Services Committee report found that air support was unavailable, or it would have arrived too late to make a difference.&lt;ref name=M.S.R.&gt;{{cite news|author1=M.S.R.|title=Could a Hollywood film about Benghazi damage Clinton?|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2016/01/outstandown-nonsense-0|date=January 18, 2016|accessdate=January 19, 2016|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; French defended the film's references to air support, writing that even if resources could not have been flown in during the time available, this would itself be "scandalous", given Libya's known instability.&lt;ref name="French" /&gt; In July 2016, the Republican-led House Select Committee on Benghazi released its report that included numerous witnesses indicating that U.S. military help was available, but not called upon. The report indicated the Department of Defense would not provide the requested list of military assets that were available that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://benghazi.house.gov/NewInfo |title=Select Committee on Benghazi Releases Proposed Report &amp;#124; Select Committee on Benghazi |publisher=Benghazi.house.gov |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013190741/http://benghazi.house.gov/NewInfo |archive-date=October 13, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film also asserts that Ambassador Stevens didn't want additional security, but that is false.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2018}}

American conservative columnist [[Deroy Murdock]] wrote that the film confirmed his personal view that President [[Barack Obama]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] were lying when they initially blamed the [[YouTube]] video ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]'' for the attacks in the weeks after they occurred. The video led to various [[reactions to Innocence of Muslims|protests among Muslims around the world]], and Obama and others initially stated publicly that the Benghazi attacks emerged from such a protest. Murdock noted that ''13 Hours'' instead portrays the attacks as having been initiated by "well-armed jihadists who know exactly what they are doing".&lt;ref name="murdock"&gt;{{cite web |title=13 Hours Confirms Obama's and Hillary Clinton's Lies about Benghazi |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/430080/13-hours-movie-benghazi-obama-hillary-clinton |first=Deroy |last=Murdock |work=National Review |date=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the vehicles used in the movie are models from later years, especially the [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class]] (model year 2013) and the [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W205)]] (model year 2015) which did not exist when the attacks happened in 2012, only known to be original prototypes.

'''''A Prairie Home Companion''''' is a weekly radio [[variety show]] created and hosted by [[Garrison Keillor]] that aired live from 1974 to 2016. In 2016, musician [[Chris Thile]] took over as host, and the successor show was eventually renamed ''[[Live from Here]]''. ''A Prairie Home Companion'' aired on Saturdays from the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]; it was also frequently heard on tours to [[New York City]] and other U.S. cities. The show is known for its musical guests, especially [[Folk music|folk]] and traditional musicians, tongue-in-cheek radio drama, and relaxed humor. Keillor's wry storytelling segment, "[[Lake Wobegon|News from Lake Wobegon]]", was the show's best-known feature during his long tenure.

Distributed by [[Minnesota Public Radio]]'s distribution arm, [[American Public Media]], ''A Prairie Home Companion'' was heard on 690 [[public radio]] stations in the United States at its peak in spring{{Date needed|date=April 2018}} 2015 and reached an audience of four million U.S. listeners each week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.twincities.com/2017/12/06/whats-next-after-end-of-decades-long-keillor-mpr-relationship/|title=What’s next after end of decades-long Keillor-MPR relationship?|date=2017-12-06|work=Twin Cities|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show borrowed its name from a radio program in existence in 1969 that was named after the [[Prairie Home Cemetery]] near [[Concordia College, Moorhead|Concordia College]], in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/features/hodgepodge/25anniversary/list/c_cemetery.html| title=PHC 25th anniversary website| accessdate=December 15, 2009| website=prairiehome.publicradio.org}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It inspired a 2006 [[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|film of the same name]], written by Keillor, directed by [[Robert Altman]], and featuring Keillor, [[Kevin Kline]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Meryl Streep]], and [[Lindsay Lohan]].

==History==
=== Origin ===
The Saturday-evening show was a partial spin-off of ''A Prairie Home Morning Show'' with Keillor and [[Tom Keith]], which ran from 6 to 9&amp;nbsp;a.m. on [[Minnesota Public Radio]] and was continued by Keith and Dale Connelly for many years as ''[[The Morning Show (Minnesota Public Radio)|The Morning Show.]]''

After researching the [[Grand Ole Opry]] for an article, Keillor became interested in doing a variety show on the radio. On July 6, 1974, the first live broadcast of ''A Prairie Home Companion'' took place. That show was broadcast from St. Paul in the Janet Wallace Auditorium of [[Macalester College]]. Twelve audience members turned out, mostly children. The second episode featured the first performance on the show by [[Butch Thompson]], who became house pianist. Thompson stayed with the program until 1986 and still frequently performs on the show.

In 1978, the show moved into the World Theater in St. Paul, which Minnesota Public Radio purchased and renovated in 1986 and renamed the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in 1994. This is the same venue the program uses today.

=== Hiatus ===
The show went off the air in 1987, with a "final performance" on June 13, and Keillor married and spent some time abroad during the following two years. For a brief time, the show was replaced—both on the air and in the World Theater—by ''[[Good Evening (radio program)|Good Evening]]'', hosted by [[Noah Adams]], a live variety show designed by ex-''Prairie Home'' and ''[[All Things Considered]]'' staffers to retain the audience Keillor had cultivated over the years. However, many stations opted instead to continue ''APHC'' repeats in its traditional Saturday time slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Bowermaster| first=Jon| title=Fresh Voices Hope to Be Far From Wobegon| newspaper=The New York Times| date=December 13, 1987 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/13/arts/television-fresh-voices-hope-to-be-far-from-wobegon.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Keillor returned to radio with ''The American Radio Company of the Air'' (renamed ''Garrison Keillor's American Radio Company'' in its second season), broadcast originally from the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]]. The new program featured a broadly similar format to ''A Prairie Home Companion'', with sketches and musical guests reflecting a more New York sensibility, rather than the country and folk music predominant in ''APHC''. Also, while Keillor sang and delivered a regular monologue on ''American Radio Company'', Lake Wobegon was initially downplayed, as he felt it was "cruel" to talk to a [[Brooklyn, NY|Brooklyn]] audience about life in a small town. During this period, Keillor revived the full ''APHC'' format only for "annual farewell performances". In the fall of 1992, Keillor returned to the World Theater with ''ARC'' for the majority of the season, with Lake Wobegon and other ''APHC'' elements gradually but unmistakably returning to prominence.
=== Return and final years ===
[[File:2011APHC.jpg|thumb|''A Prairie Home Companion'' at the 2011 Minnesota State Fair]]
The following year, on October 2, 1993, the program officially reverted to the ''A Prairie Home Companion'' name and format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Songer| first=Marcia| title=Garrison Keillor: A Critical Companion| publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group| year=2000| pages=9–10| isbn=0-313-30230-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many of the episodes originated from St. Paul, the show often traveled to other cities around the U.S. and overseas for its live weekly broadcasts. Common road venues included [[The Town Hall]] in New York City; [[Tanglewood]] in [[Lenox, Massachusetts]]; [[Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts]] in [[Vienna, Virginia]]; [[Ryman Auditorium]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theater]] in Los Angeles; and the State Theater in [[Minneapolis]]. It also broadcast a show each year from the [[Minnesota State Fair]].

The show was originally distributed nationally by Minnesota Public Radio in association with [[Public Radio International]]. Later, its distributor was Minnesota Public Radio's distribution unit, [[American Public Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Listening Information {{!}} A Prairie Home Companion| url=https://www.prairiehome.org/listen/| website=www.prairiehome.org| accessdate=2 December 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202234731/https://www.prairiehome.org/listen/| archive-date=December 2, 2016| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guest hosts===
[[File:2016-01-30ChrisThileAPHC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Thile as guest host in 2016]]
Singer [[Sara Watkins]] of San Diego, California hosted the January 15, 2011, broadcast. The format was the same, but Keillor appeared only as a guest actor and to deliver the News from Lake Wobegon. He claimed he had taken the chance to see the show being performed for himself. It was reported that this could be the beginning of a trend toward Keillor's eventual retirement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/state-of-the-arts/archive/2011/01/the-news-from-lake-woebegon-more-guest-hosts-likely.shtml |title=The news from Lake Wobegon: more guest hosts likely &amp;#124; State of the Arts |publisher=Minnesota Public Radio News |date=2011-01-15 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on March 16, 2011, Keillor stated in an interview with the [[AARP]] that he would most likely retire from the show by the time he turned 70 in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Carol (2011-03-16).

Retrieved March 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29, 2011, [[Erica Rhodes]] expressed frustration over not being picked to guest host.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In September 2011, Keillor told ''[[The Tuscaloosa News]]'' that his last broadcast would be recorded in "early July 2013", and that instead of a permanent replacement host, there will be "a whole group of people. A rotation of hosts",&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Mark Hughes (2011-09-09).

Retrieved September 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but in December 2011 Keillor said he had changed his mind and reconsidered his plans to retire because he still enjoyed hosting the show.

On February 7 and 14, 2015, mandolinist [[Chris Thile]] hosted the show (like Sara Watkins, a member of [[Nickel Creek]]). As when Watkins hosted, the format remained largely unchanged, but Keillor did not make an appearance. Instead, storyteller [[Tristan Jimerson]] appeared on the February 7 show and comedian/storyteller [[Elna Baker]] on the February 14 show. Thile's band [[Punch Brothers]] performed on the February 7 show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Seel |first1=Steve |title=Musician Chris Thile subs for Keillor on APHC |url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/02/07/thile |publisher=Minnesota Public Radio News |date=February 7, 2015 |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thile was named permanent host of the show in late June 2015.

===Name change===

From the show's inception until 1987, its theme song was [[Hank Snow]]'s hit "[[Hello Love (Hank Snow song)|Hello Love]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Sawyer| first1=Bobbie Jean| title=The Country Roots of 'A Prairie Home Companion'| url=http://www.wideopencountry.com/the-country-roots-of-a-prairie-home-companion/|website=Wide Open Country| accessdate=2 December 2016| date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1987, each show has opened with [[Spencer Williams]]' composition "[[Tishomingo Blues]]" as the theme song, with lyrics written especially for ''A Prairie Home Companion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Barton| first1=Chris| title=Garrison Keillor brings 'A Prairie Home Companion' to a close at the Hollywood Bowl| url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-st-prairie-home-companion-final-show-review-20160627-snap-story.html| accessdate=2 December 2016| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music is a main feature of the program; the show is a significant outlet for [[American folk music]] of many genres, especially [[country music|country]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[blues]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]], but it also has guest performers from a wide variety of other styles of music, including classical, opera, and music from a number of different countries. The country musician and former record company executive [[Chet Atkins]] has appeared on the show many times, as have singer-songwriters [[Mark Knopfler]] (lead guitarist and [[frontman]] of the bands [[Dire Straits]] and the [[Notting Hillbillies]]) and [[Jeff Lang]]. Folk/gospel duo [[Robin and Linda Williams]] have been regular guests since 1976, and often join Keillor and another female performer, often [[Jearlyn Steele]], to form "The Hopeful Gospel Quartet". [[Peter Ostroushko]], [[Greg Brown (folk musician)|Greg Brown]], [[Jean Redpath]], and [[Prudence Johnson]], among others, were recurring guests on the program between 1974 and 1987. The [[Wailin' Jennys]] and Andra Suchy are current recurring guests, and when the show travels, Keillor generally features local musicians and acts.

Greetings from members of the audience to friends and family at home (frequently humorous) are read each week by Keillor just after the show's [[intermission]], at the top of the second hour. Birthdays and anniversaries of famous composers and musicians are also observed.

===Features===
[[File:PrairieHomeCompanion2007RhubarbSisters.JPG|thumb|190px|The Rhubarb Sisters singing during taping of the show]]
Keillor and the ensemble performed comedy [[skits]]. Notable skits and characters often recur, such as the satirical "[[Guy Noir]], [[Private investigator|Private Eye]]", which parodied [[film noir]] and [[radio dramas]]. Guy Noir's popularity was such that the first few notes of the theme or the first lines of the announcer's introduction ("A dark night in a city that knows how to keep its secrets&amp;nbsp;...") often drew applause and cheers from the audience. Also regularly featured were the adventures of Dusty and Lefty, "The Lives of the Cowboys".

===News from Lake Wobegon===
One of the show's best-known features was Keillor's "News from Lake Wobegon", a weekly storytelling monologue, claiming to be a report from his fictitious hometown of [[Lake Wobegon]], "the little town that time forgot and the decades cannot improve&amp;nbsp;... where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average". The opening words of the [[monologue]] usually did not change: "Well, it's been a quiet week in Lake Wobegon, Minnesota, my hometown, out on the edge of the [[prairie]]." Keillor often poked fun at central Minnesota's large [[Scandinavian-American]] and [[German-American]] communities, and many of his fictional characters have names that reflect this. The "News from Lake Wobegon" did not have a set structure, but featured recurring characters and places such as the Chatterbox Café, the Sidetrack Tap, Pastor Ingqvist of the Lake Wobegon [[Lutheran Church]] and his successor Pastor Liz, Father Emil of Our Lady of Perpetual Responsibility Roman Catholic Church (a parody of [[Our Mother of Perpetual Help]]),{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} the Lake Wobegon [[Whippets]] sports teams, various members of the Bunsen and Krebsbach families, and an assortment of nearby "Norwegian bachelor farmers".{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Once a year the program featured a special "joke show", which generally included the Lake Wobegon monologue and musical acts, but with other skits replaced by the performers taking turns telling jokes. Humorists such as [[Paula Poundstone]] and [[Roy Blount Jr.]] often made guest appearances on those shows, and listeners and audience members were encouraged to submit jokes for use on the air.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

[[In-joke]]s are also sprinkled through the show, such as "Piscacadawadaquoddymoggin", a made-up word that's been used both for places and for people's names. The components of this made-up word are portions of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] place names in the New England region of the United States, most of them in Maine (i.e.: Piscataqua, Passamaquoddy, and Androscoggin).

===Fictional sponsors===
[[Image:PrairieHomeCompanionGuysShoes.JPG|thumb|right|A sign for "Guy's Shoes", one of ''A&amp;nbsp;Prairie Home Companion''{{'}}s fictitious sponsors.]]
The show creates fictional advertisements for fictional products, performed in the style of live old-time radio commercials. The show acknowledges its actual [[underwriting spot|underwriters]] at the beginning, end, and middle (break) of the show.

''Prairie Home''{{'}}s most prominent "sponsor" is the fictitious "Powdermilk Biscuits". Before he and the band performed the product's jingle every week ("Has your family tried 'em, Powdermilk?"), [[Garrison Keillor]] would extol Powdermilk's virtues in this way:

{{cquote|Heavens they're tasty, and expeditious. Give shy persons the strength they need to get up and do what needs to be done. Made from whole wheat raised by Norwegian bachelor farmers, so you know they're not only good for you, they're pure, mostly.

Among its other "sponsors", Bebop-A-Reebop [[Rhubarb pie|Rhubarb Pie]] (and Frozen Rhubarb Pie Filling) has been prominent, with ads featuring the Bebop-A-Reebop jingle, performed to the tune of "[[Shortnin' Bread]]":{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}{{quote|One little thing can revive a guy&lt;br&gt; And that is a piece of rhubarb pie&lt;br&gt; Serve it up, nice and hot&lt;br&gt; Maybe things aren't as bad as you thought&lt;br&gt; Momma's little baby loves rhubarb, rhubarb&lt;br&gt; Bebopareebop rhubarb pie.&lt;ref name=RhubarbEx&gt;{{cite web | author = Keillor, Garrison, [[Tim Russell]], [[Sue Scott (actress)|Sue Scott]], and [[Fred Newman (actor)|Fred Newman]] | date = February 14, 2004 | title = Rhubarb [Segment;''A Prairie Home Companion, with Garrison Keillor''] | format=transcript| url=http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/2004/02/14/scripts/rhurbarb.shtml| location = Saint Paul, MN| publisher=American Public Media| access-date=November 30, 2016}} [Contributing performer/writer names for this program were inferred by a Wikipedia editor from initials appearing in this source, based on regular cast information appearing elsewhere.]&lt;/ref&gt;}} The jingle is usually sung after a bombastic, sound-effect-enhanced tale of woe, and is immediately followed by Keillor asking, "Wouldn't this be a great time for a piece of rhubarb pie? Yes, nothing gets the taste of shame and humiliation out of your mouth quite like Bebop-A-Reebop Rhubarb Pie."&lt;ref name=RhubarbEx/&gt;{{better source|date=December 2016}}

Other prominent "sponsors" include Bertha's Kitty Boutique, whose locations in the fictional "Dales" shopping centers ("Roy 'n' Dale, Airedale, Teasdale, Clydesdale, Chippendale, Mondale, and all the other fine shopping centers") allude to various real people and things, and The Catchup &lt;!-- CORRECT SPELLING, see http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/20030927/scripts/catchup.shtml --&gt;Advisory Board — its name a mashup of the common "catsup" and "ketchup" spellings—which has the tagline "Catchup: For the good times."&lt;ref name=CatchupEx&gt;{{cite web| last1=Keillor| first1=Garrison| first2=Tim| last2=Russell| first3=Sue| last3=Scott| first4=Rich| last4=Dworsky| last-author-amp=yes| date=February 4, 2012| title=Catchup [Segment;''A Prairie Home Companion, with Garrison Keillor'']| format=streaming video| url=http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/2012/02/04/videos/02.shtml| location=Saint Paul, MN| publisher=American Public Media| access-date=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the recurring segment "The Lives of the Cowboys" featured its own Western-themed sponsors, including Prairie Dog Granola Bars ("healthier than chewing tobacco and you don't have to spit") and Cowboy Toothpicks ("the toothpick that's guaranteed not to splinter").{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Alterations===
While much of the show is directed toward [[radio comedy]], a portion is usually devoted to some more sentimental and sometimes dark stories put together by Keillor and others. The program occasionally also features political satire. At the beginning of the June 5, 2004, show (broadcast from [[Meadowbrook U.S. Cellular Pavilion|Meadowbrook Musical Arts Center]] in [[Gilford, New Hampshire]]), Keillor announced that former U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] had died. A member of the audience hooted and cheered loudly, but Keillor, a staunch Democrat, gave the Republican Reagan a warm tribute in the form of a gospel song. Similarly, in a 2002 show airing the weekend after the death of Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], Keillor changed the format of the show, starting it off with Wellstone's favorite segment, Guy Noir, skipping even the show's theme song.

'''''Another World''''', also known as '''''Out of This World''''' in North America and '''''Outer World'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|''Outer World''|アウターワールド|Autā Wārudo}}}} in Japan, is a [[1991 in video gaming|1991]] [[Platform game#Cinematic platform game|cinematic platformer]] [[action-adventure game]] designed by [[Éric Chahi]] and published by [[Delphine Software International|Delphine Software]]. The game tells a story of Lester, a young scientist who, as a result of an experiment gone wrong, finds himself on a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival.

''Another World'' was developed by Chahi alone over a period of about two years, with only help with the soundtrack from Jean-François Freitas. Chahi developed his own [[game engine]], completing all the game's art and animations in [[Vector graphics|vector]] form to reduce memory use, with some use of [[rotoscope|rotoscoping]] to help plan out character movements. Both narratively and gameplay-wise, he wanted the game to be told with little to no language or user-interface elements. The game was originally developed for the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] but has since been widely ported to other contemporary systems, including home and portable consoles and mobile devices. Chahi has since overseen release of various anniversary releases of the game.

''Another World'' was innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and [[cutscene]]s, which earned the game praise among critics and commercial success. It also influenced a number of other video games and designers, inspiring such titles as ''[[Ico]]'', ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', ''[[Silent Hill (video game)|Silent Hill]]'', and even Delphine's later ''[[Flashback (1992 video game)|Flashback]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Megadrive another world.png|thumb|left|The first level of the [[Sega Genesis]] version, with Lester climbing out of the pond into which he has been teleported.]]

''Another World'' is a [[platform game]], featuring a control scheme where the player uses either the keyboard, [[joystick]] or [[gamepad]] to make the protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation-specific actions, such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial part of the game, the player's character Lester is unarmed. He is able to kick at small creatures, but is otherwise defenseless.

Later in the game, the player acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the ability to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uk.ign.com/videos/2012/03/26/86-laser-gun-another-world-igns-top-100-video-game-weapons | title=Tenchi Muyo GXP - Volume 1: Out of This World (Collector's Box) - #86: Laser Gun (Another World) - IGN's Top 100 Video Game Weapons | publisher=IGN | date=2012-03-26 | accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.

Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game ends immediately if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard.&lt;ref name=gr/&gt; However, the game uses numerous [[saved game|checkpoints]] enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. In any given scene, the game provides no clues as to what the player should do next, features no [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] except for an oxygen bar during the swimming sequences, and no on-screen text; and the characters the player meets speak in unintelligible alien language.&lt;ref name=1up/&gt;&lt;ref name=retro/&gt;

==Plot==
The [[protagonist]] of the game is Lester Knight Chaykin, a young genius [[physicist]]. In the opening cinematic, Lester arrives at his high-tech underground laboratory in his [[Ferrari 288 GTO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Out of this World Manual | publisher=Interplay | author=Cousseau, Pierre | page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a thunderstorm and goes to work on his experiment using a [[particle accelerator]], attempting to reconstruct what happened when the universe was born. Immediately before the particles reach their intended destination, a lightning bolt strikes the laboratory and interferes with the accelerator, causing an unforeseen particle fusion and an explosion, opening a hole in time and space and [[teleportation|teleporting]] Lester to a barren, alien planet.&lt;ref name=1up/&gt;

After evading a number of dangerous indigenous animals, Lester is captured by a race of humanoid [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|aliens]] and taken to a subterranean prison camp. Lester escapes along with an alien captive known as "Buddy" and the two of them must evade capture while travelling through a series of dangerous environments, battling alien soldiers and wild creatures while solving numerous puzzles in order to survive. The duo traverse the prison complex, a cave system and a tower structure.&lt;ref name=1up/&gt;&lt;ref name=retro/&gt; In the game's climax, Lester is severely wounded by one of the aliens, but with the help of his alien friend, manages to kill his attacker and escape. After reaching the top of the tower, Lester collapses, but is promptly joined by Buddy, who picks Lester up and the two escape on a dragon-like creature, flying off to the horizon.

==Development==
[[File:Eric Chahi 2010 GDC Conference.jpg|thumb|[[Éric Chahi]], the creator of ''Another World'', at the 2010 [[Game Developers Conference]]]]

The game's French designer Éric Chahi had previously worked as a [[game programmer]] and then as a [[graphic designer]] for video games since 1983. It was the success of his earlier work with [[Paul Cuisset]] as a graphic designer for the [[adventure game]] ''[[Future Wars]]'' for [[Delphine Software International|Delphine Software]] and its royalties that gave him the chance to develop ''Another World'' "without any constraint of any sort or any editorial pressure." After ''Future Wars'' was released in 1989, Chahi had the choice either to work on Cuisset's next game, ''[[Operation Stealth]]'', or create his own game. As "there had been many books and tools released to develop easily on the [[Amiga]] at that time," Chahi felt confident that he could go back to programming.&lt;ref name=inter/&gt;

The game was influenced by works that Chahi liked at the time. The art and atmosphere were influenced by [[science fiction]] books such as ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'', artists such as [[Michael Whelan]], and comic illustrators such as [[Richard Corben]].&lt;ref name=inter/&gt; [[Manga]] such as ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' influenced the way it suggests a lot with very little, character blurring effects, and charging power attacks.&lt;ref name="Eric Chahi Interview"&gt;{{YouTube|GTb6zX7Hd5I|Another World Rotoscoping &amp; Interview Eric Chahi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1989, Chahi was impressed by the flat-color animations that the Amiga version of ''[[Dragon's Lair (1983 video game)|Dragon's Lair]]'' had and thought that it would be possible to use [[Euclidean vector|vector]] outlines to create a similar effect using much less [[Computer data storage|computer storage]]. After first attempting to write the graphical routines in [[C (programming language)|C]], he turned to [[assembly language]]. He wrote a [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]] routine for the [[Motorola 68000]] on an [[Atari ST]] to test his theory, with much success. Later, he found that he could run the code on the Amiga platform and achieve a [[frame rate]] of about 20 frames per second, later recognizing this as "a major turning point in the creation of the game" and the point where he knew the polygon approach would work.&lt;ref name="gdc postmortem"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33356/GDC_2011_Eric_Chahi_Retro_Postmortem_Another_World_.php | title = GDC 2011: Eric Chahi Retro Postmortem: Another World | first = Christian | last = Nutt | date =2011-03-03 | accessdate = 2011-03-03 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110306162759/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33356/GDC_2011_Eric_Chahi_Retro_Postmortem_Another_World_.php| archivedate= 2011-03-06 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to take advantage of the Amiga's [[genlock]] capabilities to create [[rotoscoping|rotoscoped]] animations with the polygons, using video recordings of himself performing various actions. Though he had tried to use smaller polygons (which Chahi called "pixigons") to construct the backgrounds for the scenes based on [[Deluxe Paint]] artwork, the process of creating them was excruciatingly slow, and he returned to using [[bitmap]]ped images.&lt;ref name="gdc postmortem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chahi realisation"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/page_realisation.htm|title=Another World: Realisation | publisher = [[Éric Chahi]] | accessdate = 2008-08-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080802062429/http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/page_realisation.htm| archivedate= 2 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box | width=25% | align=left | quote=''Another World'' was influenced by everything I liked at that time of my life&amp;nbsp;— mainly by pictorial art, movies and science fiction books, like ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' or ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]''. Comics and [[Fantastic art|fantasy art]] also inspired me; artists like [[Michael Whelan]], [[Richard Corben]], [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and [[Frank Frazetta]].|source=[[Éric Chahi]]&lt;ref name=inter/&gt;}}

While Chahi had a clear idea of how to implement his [[game engine]], he mostly improvised when creating the actual content of the game, allowing the game to develop "layer by layer without knowing where it was going."&lt;ref name="gdc postmortem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="genesis"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/another_world.htm | title = Another World: Genesis | publisher= Eric Chahi | accessdate=2008-08-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080829181941/http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/another_world.htm| archivedate= 2008-08-29 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He planned on creating a [[science fiction]] game that was similar to ''[[Karateka (video game)|Karateka]]'' and ''[[Impossible Mission]]''. Because he wanted to create a dramatic, cinematic experience, the game features no HUD or dialog, giving the player only a representation of the surrounding game world during both gameplay elements and the cutscenes progressing the story. However, with no idea of the technical limitations he would face while building out the story, he focused more on creating ambiance, rhythmic pacing, and narrative tension to the game.&lt;ref name="gdc postmortem"/&gt; Chahi resorted to developing his own tool with a new programming language through [[GFA BASIC]] coupled with the game's engine in Devpac assembler, to control and animate the game, interpreted in real-time by the game engine, effectively creating his own animation sequencer.&lt;ref name="gdc postmortem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chahi realisation"/&gt;

With the creation of the tools needed for building out the rest of the game by December 1989, Chahi began working on the introductory sequence as a means to validate the full capacities of his engine. The introduction sequence also gave Chahi the chance to explore the types of cinematics he could create through the engine. Chahi later considered this the "first step in the improvisation process" that he used throughout the rest of development. He finished the game's introduction sequence in early 1990 and started working on the first [[Level (video gaming)|level]]. Chahi worked at the game at a linear pace, developing each section of the game in chronological order and influenced by his own personal feelings and attitude at the time. For example, as Chahi recognized he was trying to create a game on his own, the first portions of the game evoke loneliness and isolation, reflecting Chahi's mood at the time. He did not have the original intention of the character meeting an ally, but again described the improvisation approach led him to include the alien friend, and had included specific cinematics that showed a close up of the alien to help the player imagine this world.&lt;ref name="gdc postmortem"/&gt;

Later in the game's development, Chahi added laser pistols, including the one that Lester carries for several effects. The idea was influenced by the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, but added depth to the gameplay by giving the player more options. He also found that repeated laser fire by the enemies helped to enunciate the rhythm of the game. Chahi would later add in the plasma ball that increased the available strategy to players. Several points in the game use elevators or teleporters to move Lester between levels; Chahi had used these instead of stairways, as it was difficult to produce proper animation for these.&lt;ref name="gdc postmortem"/&gt;

After 17 months of development, Chahi was only about one-third finished with the game, and realized that this rate would have been impractical. He began to take steps to simplify the development, including reusing background graphics and creating building blocks that allowed him to focus more on the game's puzzles. At the same time, he began to seek a publisher for the game. He first spoke to his former employer, Delphine Software, but also sought other distributors. One, [[Virgin Interactive]], was favourable to Chahi's game but had suggested that he change it to a [[Point and click|point-and-click]] style adventure game. Chahi had considered changing the game in line with this request but realized "the effort to do this would have been too huge, and some friends who played the game loved it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/03/03/how-another-world-almost-became-a-point-and-click-adventure/ | title=How 'Another World' almost became a point-and-click adventure | publisher=joystiq.com | date=2001-03-03 | accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, he accepted Delphine's offer in June 1991, and set a tentative release date in November. To meet this deadline, Chahi used [[storyboard]]s to sketch out the rest of the game's plot, balancing the overall pacing of the game. One ending captured on these storyboards, but abandoned, was Lester becoming the leader of the alien world. Chahi also argued for his own cover art for the game even with the time crunch for release; he had been disappointed in cover art that was foisted on his games by previous publishers and insisted he be allowed to create it for this game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-world-creator-on-improvisational-design/1100-6301814/ | title = Another World creator on improvisational design | first = Brendan | last = Sinclair | date =March 4, 2011 | accessdate  = September 15, 2018 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was finished in 1991, which inspired the game's tagline: "It took six days to create the Earth. ''Another World'' took two years"; Chahi noted his own exhaustion at completing this project is mirrored in the near-death of Lester at the end of the game.&lt;ref name="gdc postmortem"/&gt;

Upon publishing, Delphine did not perform a playtest of the full game, only having previously tested the first portion of the game. Delphine's U.S. publisher [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] undertook a full playtest and Chahi fixed a number of bugs that arose from this. Interplay had also requested additional changes in the game, including making the game longer and changing the game's introduction music. Chahi was adamant about retaining the game's opening music, and had attempted to change Interplay's minds by sending them an "infinite fax", a looped piece of paper, with the message "keep the original intro music" on it. Only when Delphine's lawyer got involved and told Interplay they legally could not change the music did Interplay relax this requirement.&lt;ref name="gdc postmortem"/&gt;&lt;ref name=versions/&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The game's music was composed by Jean-François Freitas. The music was influenced by film soundtracks such as ''[[Back to the Future]]''.&lt;ref name="Eric Chahi Interview"/&gt; Black Screen Records released CD and vinyl versions of the 18-song soundtrack in August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blackscreenrecords.limitedrun.com/products/597546-jean-francois-freitas-another-world-official-soundtrack | title = Jean-François Freitas - Another World: Official Soundtrack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
[[Image:Out Of This World - Amiga.png|thumb|Screenshot of the introduction [[cutscene]] to the final level from the original [[Amiga]] version. [[Nintendo]] requested that all scenes that feature blood, or any blood-like thing, such as the [[venus flytrap]] saliva, as well as this brief nudity scene, be redrawn, and so "crack of the naked aliens' bottoms was reduced by 3 pixels."&lt;ref name=versions/&gt;]]
The game was originally released for the Amiga and Atari ST in 1991, running at a [[display resolution]] of 320×200 pixels. These versions received less [[Playtest|play-testing]] than other versions, making for a less-fluid game, but the Amiga's sound capabilities afford it a high sound quality compared to contemporary ports. The game released on the Atari ST is identical, but with a less refined sound, and its colors are less sharp than on Amiga. These versions had [[code wheel]] protection that made it difficult to use unauthorized copies, forcing the player to enter a code (series of figures) looked up from a code wheel that came with the game. The player had to turn the wheel according to the number that was requested in the screen whenever the game is loaded in order to reload the game.&lt;ref name="versions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/page_versions.htm|title=Versions|publisher=Another World|accessdate=2008-08-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080802071301/http://www.anotherworld.fr/anotherworld_uk/page_versions.htm| archivedate= 2008-08-02&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another small change between the Amiga and ST versions and the others was that Lester would yell as he grabs the vine in the first area if he was not being chased by the beast in these versions; this feature was omitted from most other versions.

The game was published in North America under the title ''Out of This World'' in order to avoid confusion with the popular but unrelated [[soap opera]] television series ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]''. Coincidentally, the science fiction [[sitcom]] ''[[Out of This World (TV series)|Out of This World]]'' aired at the same time as the game's USA-Canada release.

=== Ports ===
Reviews praised the game's graphics, sound, and gameplay, but criticized its short span. Chahi, working for 16 hours a day for two months, responded with creating a new level just before the amphitheatre scene, when the alien friend rescues Lester at the end of a long dead-end corridor. Chahi said: "I like this extra level a lot because it reinforces the close relationship between the hero and the alien by developing their mutual aid."&lt;ref name=inter/&gt; Also added were more dangers and more save points. This ended up being the 1992 [[DOS]] version, which was coded by Daniel Morais, and had the exact code wheel protection of the Amiga and ST versions. The [[Macintosh]] features higher resolution than the DOS version, but is otherwise identical.&lt;ref name=versions/&gt;

Through [[Interplay Entertainment]], the game was ported to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES), the [[Sega Genesis]] (Mega Drive), and the [[Apple IIGS]] in 1992. The SNES, [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] (3DO) and Apple IIGS ports each contain a [[prologue]] before the introduction begins, which consists of an entry that comes from Lester's diary. The Mega Drive port's prologue is different from that of the SNES and 3DO ports. The [[Sega CD]] version of ''Another World'' combines the original game (with CD quality new music by Freitas) with the sequel, ''[[Heart of the Alien]]'',&lt;ref name=versions/&gt; and was released exclusively in North America as '''''Heart of the Alien: Out of This World Parts I and II'''''.

All of the console versions include some form of dynamic musical score during gameplay, and in the case of the Mega Drive conversion, use arrangements of the music originating in the SNES and Apple IIGS versions. This differs from other versions which only have music for the opening and ending segments. Interplay wanted to add additional tunes by [[Charles Deenen]]. They also wanted to exchange Jean-François Freitas's music for a different soundtrack, but Chahi did not agree to the change and Delphine's lawyer helped to keep the original intro music.&lt;ref name=versions/&gt; The Apple IIGS and Super NES versions were programmed by [[Rebecca Heineman]], who said: "Since Interplay wouldn't pay for a [[Super FX]] chip, I found a way to do it with [[Static random-access memory|static RAM]] on the cart and [[Direct memory access|DMA]] which got me a great frame rate. Interplay wouldn't pay for the static RAM either, so I ended up using Fast [[Read-only memory|ROM]] instruction. Interplay wouldn't pay for a 3.6 MHz ROM either. So, frustrated, I shoved my block move code into the DMA registers and use it as RAM running at 3.6 MHz. It worked. I got fast block moves on slow [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]] and made a game using polygons working on a 65816 with pure software rendering."&lt;ref name="Interview: Rebecca Heineman"&gt;{{cite interview | url=http://grokcode.com/106/interview-rebecca-heineman/ | title=Interview: Rebecca Heineman | publisher=GrokCode  | interviewer=Jess Johnson | first=Rebecca | last=Heineman | subjectlink=Rebecca Heineman| accessdate=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Another World'' is the only game directly ported from the Super NES to the Apple IIGS, which has the same [[WDC 65816/65802|65C816]] microprocessor.

The 3DO port was developed by Interplay in 1993, and features very detailed [[raster graphics]] backgrounds. However, Chahi believes that this actually detracts from the game, because the polygons do not fit in with this, and thus make the backgrounds look flat. The game's soundtrack was changed again, albeit without any legal troubles, due to Chahi's focus on a new project. Some new tunes were also added, all played from the disc, such as when Lester escapes the big pool in the first level and when he is grabbed by the guard that appears at the end. At the ending, there is a fragment of the introduction of the sequel, ''Heart of the Alien''. Also included in some versions of this 3DO release is a separate [[minigame]] "Stalactites", in which the player pushes up [[stalactite]] shapes falling from the top of the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=3DO Games Secrets: Book Two | publisher=Semantix Design Llc | author=Meston, Zach | year=1996 | page=135 | isbn=9781884364204 | author2 = Arnold, J. Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hidden feature of this version is the animation of Bill Heineman getting his head chopped off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gamemaster: The Complete Video Game Guide 1995 | publisher=St. Martin's Press | author=Rovin, Jeff | year=1995 | page=227 | isbn=9780312954390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chahi acquired the rights to ''Another World''{{'}}s [[intellectual property]] from Delphine Software International after they closed down in July 2004. Magic Productions then offered to port the game to [[mobile phone]]s, and it was ported with help from Cyril Cogordan.

It was released as a limited collector's item in cartridge form, complete with a box and manual published by the association Retro-Gaming Connexion (RGC) in 2013. The game engine was rewritten especially for the Atari Jaguar to make use of the console's several processors: the GPU and [[blitter]] perform polygon rendering; the GPU performs on-the-fly data decompression; the DSP plays stereo music and sound effects; and the 68000 CPU performs JIT compilation and execution of the scripts. The Jaguar version is playable in the original graphics 16-color mode and ''Deluxe 15th Anniversary'' graphics 256-color mode. It can be played in normal and speed-run modes. It supports five languages: English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mleguludec.free.fr/product/AnotherWorld_Jaguar/ |title=Pré-commande Another World (Jaguar) - asso RGC |publisher=Mleguludec.free.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrocollect.com/News/pre-orders-open-for-the-atari-jaguar-port-of-eric-chahis-another-world-out-of-this-world.html |title=Pre-Orders Open For The Atari Jaguar Port Of Eric Chahi's Another World (Out Of This World) |publisher=RetroCollect |date=2012-12-18 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of the Pocket PC version, in 2006 Chahi created a new Windows version targeted at [[Windows XP]]. Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds. He found that his original choice to use polygons for the game characters enabled him to use the original character art at a higher resolution. The game still supports the original 320×200 resolution, as well as the original background art (as an option), and it features twice as many checkpoints as the original, which makes it somewhat easier,&lt;ref name=versions/&gt; as well as newly remixed sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uk.ign.com/games/another-world/pc-873014 | title=Another World (15th Anniversary Edition) – PC | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game does not include Interplay's extra music, but it includes the extra level, as well as the added enemies and hazards from the console versions. This version is part of the ''Another World 15th Anniversary Edition'' CD-ROM released in 2007, which also includes a development diary, an exclusive postcard autographed by Chahi and a separate soundtrack CD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tac.iqp.pl/gra.php?id=9 | title=The Adventure Collection – gra Another World – 15th Anniversary Edition | publisher=IQ Publishing | accessdate=2012-10-30 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CD-ROM version of ''15th Anniversary Edition'' contains strict [[digital rights management]] technology&amp;nbsp;– upon installation, the game verifies the user's serial number through the Internet, allowing only for five installations of the game using any given serial number. Uninstallation does not reset the count, so after five installations, the player must purchase a new copy. This problem does not exist on the digital copy sold by [[GOG.com]].&lt;ref name=retro&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker|first=John|title=Retrospective: Another World 15th Anniversary Edition|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/another-world-retrospective|work=Eurogamer|publisher=The Eurogamer Network|date=2010-04-24|accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Digital Lounge, the goal was to "simply to deliver the original experience of ''Another World'' faithfully, with the benefits of today’s hardware and a high level of polish.

A sequel titled ''[[Heart of the Alien]]'' was developed by Interplay and released exclusively for the [[Sega CD]] in 1994. The game is similar in graphics and gameplay, as the player plays as Lester's alien friend Buddy. Chahi had nothing to do with the development of the sequel, beyond suggesting "redesigning the game from the alien point of view," by which he meant making an alternative version of the original game but was misunderstood.&lt;ref name=versions/&gt; In 2014, Polish filmmaker Bartek Hławka created a live-action fan film titled ''Another World: The Movie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/30/5764288/another-world-the-movie-live-action-intro-remake-video |title=Another World's intro gets a stunning live-action remake |publisher=Polygon |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chahi has stated in several interviews that he has no intention of making a sequel, as he wants the ending of the original to remain ambiguous and fans could make their own conclusion to Lester's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reed|first1=Kristan|title=Another World: 15th Anniversary Edition|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/another-world-15th-anniversary-edition-interview|website=EuroGamer.net|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Eric Chahi|url=http://eboredom.20m.com/features/interviews/chahi.html|website=eBoredom|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company that produced ''Another World'', Delphine Software, has since gone into [[Receivership|administrative receivership]] and ''Another World'' remains their most recognized game. Paul Cuisset's best-selling 1992 game ''[[Flashback (1992 video game)|Flashback]]'', also released by Delphine but created without any involvement from Chahi, features similar gameplay and graphics and makes a few nods to ''Another World'', including the use of personal force fields in combat, a nearly identical end text in the ending cutscene, and an almost exact motion recreation of the gun pickup cutscene. A very similar plot premise was used in 1999's ''[[Outcast (video game)|Outcast]]'' by [[Infogrames Entertainment]], too from France.&lt;ref name=retro/&gt; The game also had a big influence on several other game designers, especially in Japan. [[Fumito Ueda]] cited ''Another World'' as an inspiration for his creation of ''[[Ico]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134513/a_complex_journey_ninja_theorys_.php | title=A Complex Journey: Ninja Theory's ''Enslaved'' | publisher=Gamasutra | date=2010-09-17 | accessdate=2012-10-30 | author=Nutt, Christian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hideo Kojima]], creator of the ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series, said it was one of the five games that influenced him the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashcraft|first=Brian|title=Five Games That Matter In Hideo Kojima's Life|url=http://kotaku.com/5022205/five-games-that-matter-in-hideo-kojimas-life|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video game designer [[Goichi Suda]] called it his favourite game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= RisingStarGames|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BA3MnMx_nU |title=Suda-51 Hoshi interview |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chahi returned to the concept of cinematic platform games after leaving Delphine. In 1998, he and his company Amazing Studio made ''[[Heart of Darkness (video game)|Heart of Darkness]]'', which is in many ways a [[spiritual successor]] to ''Another World''. After that, Chahi disappeared from the game industry for several years, but in 2005 he regained interest in making video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamedevblog.com/2005/03/more_gdc.html | title=More GDC | publisher=gamedevblog.com | date=2005-03-11 | accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Ubisoft]] released his next game, ''[[From Dust]]''. {{-}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2272">An '''aretology''' (from ancient Greek [[arete (moral virtue)|aretê]], "excellence, virtue") in the strictest sense is a narrative about a divine figure's miraculous deeds. In the [[Greco-Roman world]], aretologies represent a religious branch of [[rhetoric]] and are a prose development of the [[hymn]] as praise poetry. [[Asclepius]], [[Isis]], and [[Serapis]] are among the deities with surviving aretologies in the form of [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] and [[papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Pernot, ''Rhetoric in Antiquity,'' translated by W.E. Higgins (Catholic University of America Press, 2005), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ''aretologos'' (ἀρετολόγος, "virtue-speaker") was a temple official who recounted aretologies and may have also interpreted dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Walter, ''The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition'' (Ashgate, 2003), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, an aretology is also a "catalogue of virtues" belonging to a person; for example, [[Cicero]]'s list and description of the virtues of [[Pompey the Great|Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great")]] in the speech ''[[Pro Lege Manilia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Rees, "Panegyric," in "''A Companion to Roman Rhetoric'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Aretology became part of the Christian rhetorical tradition of [[hagiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter, ''The Warrior Saints,'' p. 17; Alistair Stewart-Sykes, ''From Prophecy to Preaching: A Search for the Origins of the Christian Homily'' (Brill, 2001), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an even more expanded sense, aretology is [[moral philosophy]] which deals with [[virtue]], its nature, and the means of arriving at it.{{cn|date=December 2012}} It is the title of an ethical tract by [[Robert Boyle]] published in the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Harwood, ''The Early Essays and Ethics of Robert Boyle'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1991), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baby Face Finlayson''' is a fictional character in a [[comic strip]] in the UK [[comic book|comic]] ''[[The Beano]]'', first appearing in issue 1553, dated 22 April 1972. Baby Face Finlayson "The Cutest Bandit in the West" is an [[outlaw]] from the [[American Old West]], and is, in fact, a baby.

His name is derived from the real-life American gangster of the 1930s [[Baby Face Nelson]] (real name Lester Joseph Gillis).

He was originally a minor character in [[Little Plum]], but was later given a spin-off strip of his own. He rode around in a motorised pram, stealing everything that wasn't tied down, whilst shouting "Yuk Yuk!". He had a number of accomplices, including Jessie James, Sid the Kid and Goo Goo McGoo who were also, apparently, babies. Their chief nemesis was [[Sheriff]] "Marsh" Mallow of Cactus Gulch.

When the strip returned in 1980, the Wild West theme was dropped, and the setting was moved to England. The tagline was also changed to "The Cutest Bandit Around". However, in the final strip of the second series, he was posted back to America by the angry Beano editor, whom Baby-Face had tried to kidnap. On both occasions, the strip was drawn by [[Ron Spencer]].

In issue 3181, dated 5 July 2003, he cameoed in a [[Little Plum]] strip, when he stole Little Plum's wigwam. He sped off in his pram, crashed into a buffalo so Little Plum thought he had learned his lesson, until he steals Little Plum's clothes without him noticing and rides off. In September 2004 he reappeared again for five weeks in his own strip, this time drawn by [[Emilios Hatjoullis]]. He has appeared in the [[Beano Annual]] every year since then. In 2006 Baby Face returned as a villainous gangster in the [[Bash Street Kids]] adventures "School's Out" and "Hot Rod Cow", written and drawn by Kev F Sutherland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Big Bad: Baby Face Finlayson in the longer strips by Kev F Sutherland  | work=TV Tropes  | url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheBeano | accessdate=18 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He appears in the 2008 Beano annual in the story "Pluggy Love", where Danny believes that Plug's girlfriend is evil as he thinks Baby-Face is her father. It turns out she's his babysitter and her father was pushing his pram. He appeared once again in the 2009 annual in "Reservoir Dodge", where after discovering a Weather-Predicting device Roger and Walter sold him is fake, he tries to kill them and invites a group of other fictional villains over, like the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], a [[Dalek]], a [[devil]], and [[Bully Beef and Chips|Bully Beef]]. Other Beano characters try to help Roger, but are also placed above the piranha fish tank. However Alexander the Lemming and Winston the Cat push the tank over, forcing the villains away.

Baby-Face Finlayson returned to The Beano in the Funsize Funnies in #3660 drawn by [[Alexander Matthews]].&lt;ref&gt;http://alexandercartoons.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/beano-bonzanzo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baghdad Zoo''' is a {{convert|200|acre|0|sing=on}} [[zoo]] originally opened in 1971 and located in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], in the Al Zawra’a Gardens area along with the Al Zawra’a Dream Park (amusement park) and Zawra'a Tower. Before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the zoo housed 650 animals. After being nearly destroyed during the 2003 Iraqi war, when only about 35 animals survived, the zoo was reopened in 2003 and now houses about 1,070 animals.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
[[File:Al-Zawra'a Park.png|thumb|Al-Zawra'a Park]]
The Baghdad Zoo was built in 1971 under [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]].

The facilities were insufficient, with small confinement spaces considered [[Cruelty to animals|inhumane]]. After the first [[Gulf War]], Iraq's zoos suffered from the [[United Nations]] [[Iraq sanctions]], limited particular foods, medicines, and [[vaccine]]s.

[[Saddam Hussein]] closed the zoo for renovations in the spring of 2002.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nc_zoo_relief"/&gt;

=== 2003 invasion ===
The zoo was destroyed during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. For their own safety, zoo workers suspended feeding the animals in early April 2003, when [[Fedayeen Saddam]] troops took up defensive positions around the zoo as U.S. forces began the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|battle of Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"/&gt; Out of the original 650 to 700 animals in the Baghdad Zoo only 35 had survived to the eighth day of the invasion, and these tended to be some of the larger animals.&lt;ref name="the_elephant_man"/&gt;

During the absence of zoo staff and officials, the zoo suffered from severe [[looting]]. Cages were torn open by thieves who released or took hundreds of animals and birds. Zoo staff said most of the birds and [[Game (food)|game]] animals were taken for food as pre-war [[Famine|food shortages]] in Baghdad were exacerbated by the invasion.

Many animals were found roaming the zoo grounds.&lt;ref name="cbsnews2"/&gt; The remaining animals were found in critical condition, dying of thirst and starving in their cages, including Mandor, a 20-year-old [[Siberian tiger]] that was the personal property of [[Uday Hussein]], and Saida, a blind [[brown bear]].

Several [[lion]]s escaped from the abandoned zoo and were rounded up by American soldiers in [[armored fighting vehicle]]s. Four that would not return to their cages were shot by the soldiers.&lt;ref name="lion_escape"/&gt; Comics author [[Brian K. Vaughan]] wrote the fictionalized [[graphic novel]] ''[[Pride of Baghdad]]'' based on the lions, giving each speech and a personality.

=== Rebuilding the zoo ===
[[File:Army veterinarians, an ill tiger cub and a zoo in Iraq.jpg|thumbnail|left|Doctors from the U.S. Army give a tiger cub a medical check-up]]

In mid-April 2003 [[South Africa]]n conservationist [[Lawrence Anthony]] from the [[Thula Thula Game Reserve]] in Zululand, traveled in a hired car with two assistants from Kuwait to bring relief to the Baghdad Zoo, the first civilians to gain entry to Iraq after the invasion. Working with the Baghdad Zoo directors Dr. Adel Salman Mousa and Dr. Husham Mohamed Hussan and a few returning staff they began caring for and feeding the remaining animals, restoring basic [[hygiene]] standards, and stabilizing the situation. Anthony's journey to the zoo was delayed by safety and bureaucracy issues in the chaos of the war, and he arrived at the zoo 8 days after the invasion and started to rescue the surviving animals.&lt;ref name="the_elephant_man"/&gt;

[[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] William Sumner of the [[354th Civil Affairs Brigade]] was the military officer in charge of the zoo and joined the team improving security and stemming the tide of looters.&lt;ref name="cbsnews"/&gt; He appointed Anthony as interim zoo administrator, and remained in charge of the zoo for 14 months. He departed with his brigade in March 2004. Iraqi veteran Farah Murrani joined the rescue effort with Brendan Whittington-Jones of the Thula Thula [[game reserve]]. At various times they were joined by other conservation organizations including [[Wildaid]], [[Care for the Wild International]], and [[International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW)|IFAW]].

The zoo and surrounding park reopened to the public on July 20, 2003, following improvements and renovations by US Army engineers and featured 86 animals, including all 19 surviving lions. Most of these animals were rescued after the invasion from [[menagerie]]s at the Hussein family palaces and private zoos around Baghdad during the ongoing conflict, and included [[lion]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[brown bear]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[jackal]]s, [[camel]]s, [[ostrich]]es, [[badger]]s, and some [[primate]]s.

Whittington-Jones and Murrani remained at the zoo for another year during which time they also found homes in the US for over 30 Baghdad street dogs.

The story of the rescue of the Baghdad zoo is recounted in the book ''[[Babylon's Ark]]'' by authors Lawrence Anthony and Graham Spence.&lt;ref name="babylons_ark"/&gt; A more recent book for children called ''Saving the Baghdad Zoo, a True Story of Hope and Heroes'', was released on February 9, 2010.&lt;ref name="saving_the_zoo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inlander"/&gt;

=== Setbacks ===
On September 18, 2003, a group of U.S. Army Reserve soldiers and Iraqi police held a party in the zoo after it had closed. Sergeant Keith Mitchell of the 422nd Civil Affairs Battalion had his right arm severely mauled by a male [[Bengal tiger]]; a soldier, seeing the attack, initially shot and wounded the tiger, when this failed to stop the tiger a final shot fatally wounded the caged animal which bled to death.&lt;ref name=nordland/&gt; One report says that Mitchell was trying to feed the tiger a chicken kabob, but Mitchell denied this.&lt;ref name=nordland/&gt; The initial reports of drunkenness by the soldiers led to public condemnation, but Mitchell said he had one beer. Tests were not performed until the next morning on a half-dozen of the soldiers which found no evidence of alcohol.&lt;ref name=nordland/&gt; Court martial proceedings occurred in Washington, D.C., where Mitchell was exonerated of charges.&lt;ref name=nordland/&gt;  Mitchell's rank was restored after a three-month probationary period.  The tiger underwent a necropsy, in which no foreign food was found in its digestive tract, nor was any found around or near the cage.&lt;ref name="stonehouse"/&gt; The event inspired a play titled ''[[Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo]]'', which was staged by the Center Theatre Group in Los Angeles in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref name="tiger_at_the_zoo"/&gt;  Mitchell received an honorable medical discharge in 2006, but died from complications of diabetes, something he developed during the 24 reconstructive surgeries on his arm, in April, 2007, leaving a wife and one daughter.&lt;ref name=nordland&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/tigers-return-baghdad-88163 |title=Tigers Return to Baghdad |work=[[Newsweek]] |author=Rod Nordland |date=August 7, 2008 |accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Carolina-based [[Conservators' Center]], an exotic-wildlife conservation and preservation center, offered to donate two mix-breed tiger cubs to the Baghdad Zoo. After considerable legal and bureaucratic hurdles the tigers were delivered to the zoo on August 4, 2008. They were a male, Riley, and a female, Hope.

In 2009, three wild boars at the zoo were euthanized due to fears that they could get infected with the [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|A/H1N1 flu]] virus (Swine flu).&lt;ref name="swine_flu"/&gt;

=== Recovery ===
[[File:U.S. Tigers Donated To Baghdad Zoo.jpg|thumb|Hope playing in her new pool]]
In 2008 the zoo had grown to about 800 animals, though most of these were birds. The only large animals at the zoo were two female lions left from the 22 original lions before the invasion. On 4 August 2008, the zoo received two tiger cubs (Hope and Riley) from the Mebane, North Carolina-based Conservators' Center, an exotic-wildlife conservation and preservation center.&lt;ref name="tigers_return"/&gt;

By 2009, the zoo reported that they had about 1070 animals. To keep visitors safe, Zawraa Park, in which the zoo is located, is guarded by the special police units that guard other government facilities. Visitors are frisked and bags and baskets are checked for explosives. Although numbers cannot be verified, the director general of parks and gardens, Salah Abu al-Lail, expected close to 8 million visitors to the park in 2009.&lt;ref name="nydailynews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="france24"/&gt;

'''''Battlestations: Midway''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Eidos Hungary]] and released on January 30, 2007 for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. The Mac version of this game was developed by [[Robosoft Technologies]], based out of India and published in July 2008 by [[Feral Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feralinteractive.com/game/bsm |title=Feral Interactive - Battlestations: Midway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Set in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]] during [[World War II]], it is a hybrid of [[action game|action]] and [[real-time tactics]] as the player can both command his fleet assets and assume control of any one of them at will. The single player campaign is a series of missions from [[Pearl Harbor]] commanding an [[PT boat#Elco|Elco PT Boat]] to the [[Battle of Midway]] commanding an entire [[Carrier battle group|Carrier Battle Group]].

== Gameplay ==
In either the single-player or multiplayer game the player starts with a [[ship]], [[submarine]], [[aircraft]], [[shipyard]], [[airfield]] or a combination of any of them. The player can switch between their allocated units in order to complete objectives. Each unit also has its own unique features and controls. For example, using a [[aircraft carrier|carrier]], shipyard or airfield, players can release carrier aircraft, ships, or land-based aircraft respectively. These units can then be used to engage in naval battles, undersea actions or dogfights and bombing runs.

Players are encouraged to work together online. In multiplayer, each player controls a different group of units. Each player has different units allocated to them, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. Each side will have a specific objective to complete, whether it being to destroy or protect a certain unit or reach a certain point on the map. The team wins when they are the first to complete their objective(s).

===Single-player===
The single player campaign contains 11 historically based from the American perspective and is played through the eyes of Henry Walker, an aspiring young man trying to follow in his father's footsteps of being a great Navy Admiral, and his best friend Donald Locklear, an [[Flying ace|ace]] in the [[Flying Tigers]].

''Battlestations: Midway'' offers several challenge levels where the player's skills are tested.

The game has appearances by [[John F. Kennedy]], commanding [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|Motor Torpedo Boat ''PT-109'']]  and Franklin D. Roosevelt.

=== Multiplayer ===
''Battlestations: Midway'' supports multiplayer matches of up to eight players. Matches are team-based, beginning with each player choosing either an Allied or a Japanese starting base from a list of preset slots in the lobby. Each slot has its own unique unit or building allocation. A slot can have up to four units. Each multiplayer map is essentially a "set-piece" battle whereby all of the units on the map at the beginning of the match are the only units available to the players for the entire match. The two exceptions to this are units that can be spawned (e.g. aircraft from airfields, aircraft carriers, etc.) and the planes that respawn in the map "Air Superiority at Luzon", which is very infrequently played.

Since December 2012 [[GameSpy]] closed down all their support for ''Battlestations: Midway''. Players trying to play the Multiplayer (Powered by GameSpy) getting only error messages.

==Development==
{{expand-section|date=January 2016}}

=== Demo ===
A multiplayer demo was released on the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] on January 18, 2007. The PC demo was released on January 26, 2007, and the Mac OS X demo followed on July 24, 2008. The demos contain the multiplayer map [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons|Battle of Solomon Islands]], which supports up to 8 players. The PC demo works only for LAN play. Players will disconnect frequently when attempting to play via the internet. The Xbox 360 demo functions correctly via Xbox Live online play.

=== Downloadable content ===
Eidos released the "Iowa Mission Pack" on the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]]. This update includes several new ship models, as well as the "Raid on Truk" ship challenge and the [[Battle of Sibuyan Sea#The Battle of the Sibuyan Sea .2824 October.29|"Battle of Sibuyan Sea"]] multiplayer map. A patch has been released for the PC version.

== Sequel ==
On February 28, [[Eidos Interactive]] announced ''[[Battlestations: Pacific]]'' for [[Personal Computer|PC]] and [[Xbox 360]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/080228/aqth101.html?.v=33 Battlestations: Pacific press release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302153520/http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/080228/aqth101.html?.v=33 |date=March 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 the game became available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[[Battlestations: Pacific]] Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt; This sequel takes place right after ''Battlestations: Midway'' and has twice as many missions as the game before. It also includes 21 new units and add the ability to command troops to fight on the islands, though the player has no control over any individual land unit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.battlestations.net/news/?id=15 Eidos Battlestations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naval mine]] and [[Kamikazes]] have also been added. A new feature includes the ability to play as the Japanese from commanding the Pearl Harbor attack to Midway. Details have been added for a more realistic effect; for example, while submerged in a sub flora and fauna are visible, as well as a sea floor. The game also provides an alternate history timeline for the Japanese, a what-if scenario that tells the story of the IJN's victory at Midway, which later considers Pearl Harbor a threat to its already overextending conquest borderline, therefore forcing an invasion of Hawaii. It is also possible to, at the start of the attack on Pearl Harbor, "kill" the two main characters of ''Battlestations: Midway''. If the player managed to sink Henry's PT boat, the pilot would comment "His name was Henry. This is not his story."  After shooting down Donald's more advanced plane, he would go on to comment that "Fighter ace, huh? At least you died in the air." pointing back to Donald's death on the [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|USS ''Yorktown'']] at Coral Sea.

}}'''Big Sleeping''' is an Italian noir-humorous comic series created by [[Daniele Panebarco]].

== History and profile ==
Inspired by [[Raymond Chandler]]'s novels, the main character of the series is a private detective loosely based on [[Philip Marlowe]]. The series featured typical noir and [[hard-boiled]] elements mixed with surreal and humorous plots, such as the research of [[Godot (character)|Godot]], or the thief of the [[Star of Bethlehem|Christmas Star]].&lt;ref name=Fossati&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franco Fossati|title=Dizionario Illustrato del Fumetto|publisher=Mondadori, 1992|isbn=8804355441|chapter=Big Sleeping}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=xsz&gt;Gianni Bono. "Big Sleeping". ''Guida al fumetto italiano''. Epierre, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The series debuted in the magazine ''[[Il Mago (magazine)|Il Mago]]'', and was later published in a large number of other publications including ''[[Linus (magazine)|linus]]'', ''[[Orient Express (magazine)|Orient Express]]'', ''Comic Art'' and ''[[L'espresso]]''.  Big Sleeping was also featured in several graphic novels, the first of them being ''Il Falcone Sardese'' ([[Longanesi]], 1977), which featured the killing of [[Italian Communist Party]] secretary [[Enrico Berlinguer]] and his replacement with a double appointed to kill the American president [[Jimmy Carter]] during a public event.&lt;ref name=Fossati&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franco Fossati|title=Dizionario Illustrato del Fumetto|publisher=Mondadori, 1992|isbn=8804355441|chapter=Big Sleeping}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=xsz&gt;Gianni Bono. "Big Sleeping". ''Guida al fumetto italiano''. Epierre, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The appearance of the main character and the graphic rendering of the comics significantly evolved over the course of publications, from an early roundish and [[Fernando Botero|"boterian"]] style to a more stretched and realistic drawing.&lt;ref name=Fossati&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franco Fossati|title=Dizionario Illustrato del Fumetto|publisher=Mondadori, 1992|isbn=8804355441|chapter=Big Sleeping}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pietro Favari|title=Le nuvole parlanti: un secolo di fumetti tra arte e mass media|isbn=8822004132|publisher=Dedalo, 2006|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a city-building title, ''Cultures'' is part of a genre that tended to see success in European countries but "never seems to catch on in the States", [[GameSpot]]'s Bruce Geryk wrote in 2001.&lt;ref name=gamespotrev /&gt; ''[[PC Games (magazine)|PC Games]]'' billed it as a competitor to games such as ''[[The Settlers IV]]'' and ''[[Anno 1503]]''.&lt;ref name=pcgamesprev&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=http://archive.is/HClgt |url=http://www.pcgames.de/Cultures-Die-Entdeckung-Vinlands-Spiel-20653/News/Wo-die-wilden-Wikinger-wuseln-4890/ | title=Wo die Wilden Wikinger wuseln | date=March 7, 2001 | author=Fröhlich, Petra | work=[[PC Games (magazine)|PC Games]] | archivedate=December 2, 2018 | language=[[German language|German]] | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Retailers pre-purchased 140,000 units of ''Cultures'' in preparation for its release, and sales expectations were high; Funatics' previous title, ''Catan: Die Erste Insel'', had become a [[sleeper hit]].&lt;ref name=140k&gt;{{cite web| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203000355/https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/catan-erfolgreich,1334687.html  |url=https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/catan-erfolgreich,1334687.html | title=''Catan'' erfolgreich'' | author=''GameStar'' Editors | date=September 11, 2000 | work=[[GameStar]] | language=[[German language|German]] | archivedate=December 3, 2018 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the German market, ''Cultures'' debuted at #3 on Media Control's computer game sales chart for September 2000.&lt;ref name=month1&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001024100349/http://www.vud.de:80/charts/pcg55.php3 | url=http://www.vud.de:80/charts/pcg55.php3 | title=Stand: September 2000 | publisher=Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland | archivedate=October 24, 2000 | language=[[German language|German]] | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It placed sixth the following month, before falling to 16th in November.&lt;ref name=month2&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001209002800/http://www.vud.de:80/charts/pcg55.php3 | url=http://www.vud.de:80/charts/pcg55.php3 | title=Stand: November 2000 | publisher=Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland | archivedate=December 9, 2000 | language=[[German language|German]] | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Global sales of the game rose to 150,000 units by March 2002.&lt;ref name=heise&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181202190225/https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Moorhuhnjaeger-schiessen-Vogel-beim-Umsatz-ab-64158.html| url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Moorhuhnjaeger-schiessen-Vogel-beim-Umsatz-ab-64158.html | title=''Moorhuhnjäger'' schießen Vogel beim Umsatz ab | author=Ziegler, Peter-Michael | date=March 22, 2002 | work=[[Heinz Heise]] | archivedate=December 2, 2018 | language=[[German language|German]] | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Five Nights at Freddy's 4''','' (often abbreviated to '''''FNaF4'''''), is an [[Indie game|indie]] [[Graphic adventure game|point-and-click]] [[survival horror]] [[video game]] created by [[Scott Cawthon]]. It is the fourth installment of the ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's]]'' series. Originally planned for release on October 31, 2015, the game was pushed forward to August 8, then again to July 23, when it was unexpectedly released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref name=FNAF4IGN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/five-nights-at-freddys-4-jump-scares-a-surprise-early-release|title=Five Nights at Freddy's 4 Jump-Scares a Surprise Early Release|accessdate= July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices on July 25, 2015, and for [[iOS]] devices on August 3, 2015.

Announced in mid-2015 under the working title ''The Final Chapter'', the game is considered a departure from the previous games, which took place in a security office. Instead, the game takes place in a child's bedroom, placing an emphasis on timing and auditory warnings to complete nights.

Upon release, the game received polarizing reviews from critics; praise centered on its unsettling atmosphere, while others were divided over the game's new mechanics.

&lt;!-- Please do not add speculative content to this section or the plot section from YouTube videos, the FNAF Wiki, or your imagination as they are not considered reliable sources. --&gt;
{{refimprove section|date=September 2015}}
Unlike previous ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' games, the game is not set in a security office, but in a child's bedroom. There are no cameras, and instead of "Phone Guy", the player is given on-screen instructions to help the player during the game.&lt;ref name="KotakuAll"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-five-nights-at-freddys-4-so-f-1720003919 | title=Everything We Know About Five Nights at Freddy's 4 (So Far) | publisher=Kotaku | date=July 24, 2015 | accessdate=July 25, 2015 | author=Hernandez, Patricia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player is equipped with a flashlight, similar to the [[Five Nights at Freddy's 2|second game]], although the light has unlimited power.&lt;ref name= "Destruct"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-five-nights-at-freddy-s-4-296612.phtml | title=Review: Five Nights at Freddy's 4 | publisher=[[Destructoid]] | date=July 24, 2015 | accessdate=July 25, 2015 | author=Rowen, Nic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used to ward away any animatronics seen down the hall; however, if the player hears either Nightmare Bonnie's or Nightmare Chica's breathing at the door or they see Nightmare Fredbear or Nightmare upon turning on the flashlight, they must immediately close the door, however, the door will open as the player walks away. The player must also monitor the closet to avoid getting attacked by Nightmare Foxy by closing it if necessary, as well as shooing three miniature animatronics named 'Freddles' on the bed before they summon Nightmare Freddy to attack the player. If the player is not careful in shining the light towards the hallways or leaves the doors, closet, and bed unattended for too long, the player will be [[jump scare|jumpscared]], leading to a [[game over]].

After beating each night, the player can play a timed minigame titled "Fun with Plushtrap", where they must try to stop a small [[stuffed toy|plush toy]] version of Springtrap, the central animatronic in ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]'', on top of an "X" marked on the ground within a specific amount of time. If the player wins, the player will start the next night at 2 AM. Like the nightmare animatronics, this timed minigame becomes more difficult as the game progresses. It is impossible to use the time bonus in the unlockable modes. Additionally, if the player gets a game over, the bonus is no longer valid for further plays of the same level.

Like previous games, the game's main storyline takes place over five increasingly-difficult nights with unlockable extra levels. The first four nights will put the player against four animatronics: Nightmare Freddy, Nightmare Bonnie, Nightmare Chica, and Nightmare Foxy. Nightmare Fredbear, who combines the scare tactics of the previous four, is the sole attacker on the fifth night. Completing all five nights will unlock an additional sixth night, where the four animatronics will haunt the player until Nightmare Fredbear takes over when the clock hits 4 AM. Completing the sixth night will unlock the "Nightmare" night, where the animatronics are very persistent and Nightmare Fredbear is replaced by the highly aggressive Nightmare, who has a unique game over screen compared to other animatronics. A secret code will unlock an eighth night based on the Custom Night modes from the first two games, which sets the [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] of the animatronics to maximum difficulty. Other unlockables include galleries of the various animatronics and jumpscares, as well as behind-the-scenes looks at the 3D-modelling process for Fredbear and Foxy.&lt;ref name="Extras"&gt;{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon| publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene =Extras menu| quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in most of the previous entries of the series, the story of the game is revealed in interactive [[Retrogaming|Atari-style]] minigame sections between nights. Each of the minigames are set in a time frame corresponding to the five nights, beginning with "5 days until the party", up to "0 days until the party".

== Plot ==

The game starts with a minigame which shows a young boy who is locked in his bedroom with plush toys, which he calls his friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Five Nights at Freddy's 4|developer=Scott Cawthon|publisher=|platform=[[Personal computer|PC]]|scene=Night 1 prologue|date=July 23, 2015|quote='''Boy:''' These are my friends.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is speculated that ''Five Nights at Freddy's 4''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s gameplay is the result of the boy suffering from nightmares that he is being attacked by the animatronics, and must protect himself. After the player survives the first night, Fredbear tells the boy that "he" (Michael Afton the boy's brother) is hiding in the house, before the boy is jumpscared by Michael Afton his brother, who is wearing a Foxy mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 2 prologue| quote = '''Fredbear:''' Now he is hiding again. He won't stop until you find him.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the second night, the boy is abandoned at the pizzeria, only to be warned by Fredbear's voice that "he" is coming and that he needs to be brave; however, the boy is afraid of the animatronics and costumed mascots, and ends up crying. An [[Easter egg (interaction design)|easter egg]] during this scene briefly shows the "William Afton" from the [[Five Nights at Freddy's 2|second]] and [[Five Nights at Freddy's 3|third]] games placing someone in the Spring Bonnie suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 3 prologue| quote = '''Fredbear:''' You're too late. Hurry the other way and find someone who will help! You know what will happen if he catches you! You can find help if you can get past them. You need to be strong.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the third night, the minigame reveals that other children tease the boy, calling him a coward and crybaby,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 4 prologue| quote = '''Boy 1:''' Aren't you the kid who always hides under the table and cries? Hahaha! No one else is scared! Why are you? Stop being such a baby!}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that there are rumors of the animatronics coming to life at night and attempting to murder people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 4 prologue| quote = '''Girl 2:''' You'd better watch out! I hear they come to life at night. And if you die, they hide your body and never tell anyone.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boy sees his plush toys as his only friends and generally eschews interaction with other people in favor of them. After the fourth night, it is revealed that he was once locked in the building's parts and services room as a prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 5 prologue| quote = '''You:''' Please let me out. PLEASE! Please let me out...}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the fifth night is completed, the boy is shown crying at his own birthday party in the pizzeria. “Michael Afton” turns out to be the boy's brother, alongside other bullies wearing the masks of the animatronics to terrorize the boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 5 epilogue| quote = '''Your Brother's Friend:''' Wow, your brother is kind of a baby, isn't he? / '''Michael Afton:''' It's hilarious.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bullies, deciding to prank the boy, grab him and try to get him close to the mouth of Fredbear for a "kiss"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 5 epilogue| quote = '''Michael Afton:''' Why don't we help him get a closer look! He will love it. / '''You:''' Please! / ''Michael Afton:''' Come on, guys, let's give this little man a lift. He wants to get up close and personal! / '''You:''' No! I don't want to go! / '''Michael Afton:''' You heard the little man! He wants to get even closer! Ha ha ha!}}&lt;/ref&gt; and end up stuffing the boy's head into the mouth of Fredbear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 5 epilogue| quote = '''Michael Afton:''' Hey guys, I think the little man said he wants to give the Fredbear a big kiss! On THREE! One...two...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suddenly, Fredbear, who was in the middle of singing, forcefully closes his mouth, resulting in the boy's head being crushed while Michael Afton and his friends stare in horror. 
 
After the sixth night, the boy hears a voice apologizing to him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 6 epilogue| quote = '''Voice:''' Can you hear me? I don't know if you can hear me. I'm sorry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Fredbear promises him that no matter how many times he "breaks", he and the others will always be there to "put him back together" and will always be his friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 6 epilogue| quote = '''Fredbear:''' You're broken.

Following this, the player unlocks Nightmare mode, which is the same as the sixth night with the exception of a new animatronic, Nightmare, a more aggressive version of Nightmare Fredbear.

If the player completes Nightmare mode, an image of a locked metal trunk is displayed; if the player wiggles the padlocks, the game eventually states "Perhaps some things are best left forgotten, for now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Nightmare epilogue}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cawthon has remained cryptic about what is inside the trunk, and eventually announced that he will not disclose what is in it. He gave only one clue: "What's in the box? It's the pieces [of the franchise's story] put together."

== Development and release ==
Beginning April 27, 2015, Cawthon posted images on his website teasing at another game in the series, originally known as ''Five Nights at Freddy's: The Final Chapter''. The images, featuring the characters from the hies, cryptically teased at a release on Halloween.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2015/04/28/five-nights-at-freddys-4-release-date/ | title = Five Night’s at Freddy’s 4 teased for Halloween release | first =Brenna | last = Hillier | date = April 28, 2015 | accessdate = May 16, 2015 | work = [[VG247]]|publisher = Videogaming 247 Ltd. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A trailer was released on July 13, 2015, hinting that the game took place in the main character's house.

On October 31, 2015, two updates for the game were released. One consists of a set of cheat options, challenge modes, and an altered version of the "Fun with Plushtrap" minigame that uses a nightmare version of the character Balloon Boy (from ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 2]]'') in place of Plushtrap. The second is a "Halloween Edition" that makes cosmetic changes to Nightmare Bonnie and Nightmare Chica, and introduces nightmare versions of the second game's characters Mangle and The Puppet, the former replacing Nightmare Foxy and the latter replacing Nightmare. Nightmare Cupcake is also replaced with a jack-o-lantern.

After the 2013 semester ended, Chris Apple, Ayla Hurley, Rob Garner, and other alums founded the Washington Metropolitan Gamer Symphony Orchestra in Rockville, MD as an outlet for GSO graduates and other community musicians to come together and perform video game music.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://umd.gamersymphony.org/history.php|title=The Gamer Symphony Orchestra at the University of Maryland|website=umd.gamersymphony.org|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the GSO returned to the Smithsonian American Art Museum to perform as part of the “Watch This! Revelations in Media Art” exhibition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 semesters marked the 10th year milestone for the GSO’s foundation and first public performance respectively. Alongside the celebrations, in Fall 2015, the GSO started livestreaming its concerts on Twitch.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In March 2018, the orchestra performed at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] on [[Millennium Stage]], as part of their Direct Current performances, and featured many emeritus members. The orchestra performed various pieces which included Apotheosis, from the game [[Journey (2012 video game)|Journey]], which was personally approved by the composer [[Austin Wintory]].

== Legacy ==
The Maryland GSO hopes to inspire and assist in the creation of more GSOs in the future. They have openly encouraged high school and college students who are interested in starting a GSO at their school to contact them.

The GSO's fall 2008 concert inspired students at [[Colonel Zadok A. Magruder High School|Magruder High School]] in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville, Md.]], to found their own video game orchestra.&lt;ref name="gazette1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gazette"/&gt; The similarly named Magruder Gamer Symphony Orchestra performs regularly at the high school's instrumental music concerts as the only non-classroom ensemble.

In fall 2010, the Maryland GSO helped to establish a similar ensemble at [[Damascus High School]] in [[Damascus, Maryland|Damascus, Md.]]&lt;ref name="diamondback2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon hearing about the Maryland GSO, a student at [[Ithaca College]] founded the Ithaca College GSO in 2011. The ensemble's premiere concert was Nov. 11, 2012.&lt;ref name="ithacan"&gt;

The '''Golden Kela Awards''' ({{lang-hi|गोल्डन केला अवॉर्ड्स}}) are a satirical take on [[Bollywood]] that award the worst performances in Hindi cinema each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/india-s-razzies-golden-kela-awards-rigged/story-knQGKs7BA2fIfHEimpgnMI.html|title=India’s razzies Golden Kela Awards rigged?|date=31 January 2014|first=Debasmita|last=Ghosh|newspaper=Hindustan Times|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by ''[[Random Magazine]]'', winners are selected each year by an online poll and receive an award in the shape of a golden banana (केला ''kelā'' in [[Hindi]]).&lt;ref name="second"&gt;{{cite news|title=

A '''group-dynamic game''' is an [[experiential education]] exercise that helps people to learn about themselves, [[Personal relationship|interpersonal relationships]], and how [[group (sociology)|groups]] function from a [[group dynamics]] or [[social psychology|social psychological]] point of view.

Group dynamics can be understood as complex from an interpersonal relationships point of view because it involves:
* relationships between two people
* relationships between a person and a group
* relationships between groups

Group-dynamic [[game]]s are usually designed for the specific purpose of furthering [[personal development]], character building,&lt;!--linked to [[character development]], which is a disambig page--&gt; and [[teamwork]] via a group-dynamic [[Social environment|milieu]].  The group leader may sometimes also be the game leader, or between peers, the leadership and game-rules can change.  

Some games require large spaces, special objects and tools, quietness or many before-game and after-game needs.  When aged, frail or disabled people ("special needs") are involved, existing games may need modification to be used.

The use of group dynamic activities has a history of application in [[conflict resolution]], [[anger management]] and [[team building]] and many other areas such as [[drug rehabilitation]] and [[drama therapy]].

==Types==
{{Prose|section|date=January 2017}}
*[[Dramaturgy (sociology)]]
*Adventure-based activities (or initiative tasks)
*[[Icebreaker (facilitation)|Ice-breaker games]]
*[[Large group game]]s
*[[Psycho-drama]]
*[[Role-playing game]]s
*[[Team building]] games
*[[Trust Fall|Trust-building game]]s
*[[Win-win game]]s (also known as "cooperative games")

==Group problem solving activities==
There are a number of exercises that propose a problem that the group must solve. Some of these simply benefit from the diversity of perspectives and background knowledge inherent in groups to find the answer more quickly (Trivia, Wuzzles) while another approach is to give each individual some information and the collective information is needed to solve the problem or challenge.

These can be simple or truly elegant situations. Many can be found for free on various websites and in books designed for use by trainers. Many are readily adaptable to different situations and desired outcomes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5777">A '''hype man''', in [[hip hop music]] and [[rapping]], is a backup rapper and/or singer who supports the primary rappers with exclamations and interjections and who attempts to increase the audience's excitement with call-and-response chants.&lt;ref name=Hilltop&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehilltoponline.com/life-style/the-role-of-the-hype-man-in-hip-hop-1.464291 |title=The Hilltop - The Role of The 'Hype Man' In Hip-Hop |publisher=Thehilltoponline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717003938/http://www.thehilltoponline.com/life-style/the-role-of-the-hype-man-in-hip-hop-1.464291 |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Grant, 2006, ''The Official Dictionary of Unofficial English'', McGraw-Hill Professional, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hip Hop: An Encyclopedia of the Movement, Music, and Culture, Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Kool Moe Dee".

Retrieved 2010-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Music writer Mickey Hess expands the term as follows: "a hype man is a figure who plays a central but supporting role within a group, making his own interventions, generally aimed at hyping up the crowd while also drawing attention to the words of the [[Master_of_ceremonies#Hip_hop|MC]]".&lt;ref name=IconsofHipHop&gt;Hess, Mickey, 2007, ''Icons of Hip Hop: An Encyclopedia of the Movement, Music, and Culture'', Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the role of the hype man in the book ''[[How to Rap]]'', [[Royce da 5'9"]] describes how a hype man can contribute to a live performance: "a lot of my verses [can] be so constant with the flow [that] I'd need somebody to help me."&lt;ref name="autogenerated304"&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lateef the Truthspeaker|Lateef]] has stated, "You're gonna have to have somebody say something somewhere to give you a breath... usually it's just a matter of getting somebody to hit some line or some word in a line—that's all you really need."&lt;ref name="autogenerated304"/&gt;

==Origins==
Early [[hip hop]] hype men included Cowboy and Creole of [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]].&lt;ref name= Hilltop/&gt;&lt;ref name=IconsofHipHop/&gt; [[Kool Moe Dee]] calls Creole “the original hype man”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thafoundation.com/moedee.htm |title=Kool Moe Dee |publisher=Thafoundation.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Public Enemy 4.jpg|thumb|right|American rapper [[Flavor Flav]] hyping up a crowd in May 2008]]
The quintessential hype man, for many fans and musicians of the era, was [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s hype man [[Flavor Flav]], whose exuberant approach to the art in the group's recordings and videos made him, arguably, the first household-name hype man, a figure more famous than many MCs. He established many of the conventions of the craft, such as an outlandish sense of style (epitomized by his wearing of large clocks around his neck) and a vocal style that contrasted dramatically with that of the MC (his rasping high voice was a counterpoint to [[Chuck D]]'s booming baritone).
[[File:Hype-Man Relione with Chef Sean .jpg|thumb|right|Hype man Relione (right) performing with rapper Chef Sean]]
[[Jay-Z]] began his career as a hype man for [[Jaz-O]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2009/08/26/jay-z-record-executives/ |title=Record Executives Thought Jay-Z Was No Good » MTV Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.mtv.com |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vibe magazine, Jan 2004, Vol. 12, No. 1, published by Vibe Media Group, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; and was later the hype man for [[Big Daddy Kane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan Cunningham |url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2007-03-15/music/kane-s-domain |title=Kane's Domain - Page 1 - Music - Broward/Palm Beach - Broward-Palm Beach New Times |publisher=Broward/Palm Beach |date=2007-03-15 |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==&lt;!-- DO NOT ADD MORE WITHOUT RELIABLE CITATIONS --&gt;

Examples of hype men include [[Freaky Tah]] of the [[The Lost Boyz|Lost Boyz]], [[Memphis Bleek]] for [[Jay-Z]], and [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] and [[Mr. Porter]] of [[D12]] for [[Eminem]].&lt;ref name="IconsofHipHop" /&gt; ''Icons of Hip Hop'' also notes that some producers, such as [[Sean Combs|Diddy]], [[Lil Jon]], [[Swizz Beatz]], and [[Jermaine Dupri]], "have transitioned from a hype man role to become [[rapper]]s and stars in their own right".&lt;ref name="IconsofHipHop" /&gt;

Occasionally pop groups include a member up front alongside the lead singer who may perform backup vocals or percussion but largely functions to excite the audience through dancing and/or stage patter.

{{lowercase|i-Cybie}} [[Image:I-Cybie1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The i-Cybie.]] [[Image:I-Cybie2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|i-Cybie with walk up charger.]] '''i-Cybie''' (爱赛比) is a [[robotic]] [[pet]] that resembles a dog. It was manufactured by Silverlit Toys Manufactory Ltd Hong Kong from 2000 to 2006. i-Cybie was developed for commercial distribution by [[Tiger Electronics]]. Outrageous International Hong Kong distributed the electronic pet from 2005 to 2006.  The i-Cybie robotic dog responds to sound, touch, movement, and voice commands. The toy robot can autonomously recharge its batteries using a special docking station. I-Cybie was the first mass-produced toy that used advanced voice recognition technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.industryhk.org/english/survey/files/MadeInPRD_III_Toy_ENG_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
i-Cybie has 16 built-in motors which allow 16 degrees of freedom. There are three [[CPU]]’s—the main [[Toshiba]] TMP91C815F for motion control and for mood calculation, a [[SunPlus Technology]] [[CPU]] used for audio playback, and an [[RSC 364]] used for voice recognition and recording.&lt;ref&gt;http://servo.texterity.com/servo/200312/?pg=13#pg13&lt;/ref&gt; i-Cybie is constructed using 1400 parts, and more than 90 feet of wire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Man's+Best+Friend+Just+Got+Better%3B+Introducing+i-Cybie,+Tiger's+Most...-a076864929&lt;/ref&gt; The robot uses a suite of sensors to determine mood and behavior.

**Width: {{convert|8|in|cm}}
**Length: {{convert|12|in|cm}}
**Weight: about {{convert|4|lbs|kg}}
*Light Sensor (nose)— for motion detection in "guard" mode.
*Infrared Obstacle Detector (chest array)—for collision avoidance and edge detection. The chest array is also used to communicate with other toys (robo-chi, i-Cybie) and for receiving remote commands.
*Touch Sensors (back button, head button, nose button)— influence the i-Cybie's moods and behavior.
*Microphones (4)—three microphones are used to hear sharp sounds and one is used to discriminate voice. The robot can localize the direction of a sharp sound and move towards it.&lt;ref&gt;http://servo.texterity.com/servo/200312/?pg=13#pg13&lt;/ref&gt; I-Cybies can recognize spoken commands and respond in a specific manner.  Voice recognition features [[biometrics|biometric authentication]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.13thmonkey.org/documentation/hardware/chips/80-0116.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Voice recognition is activated by the head contact sensor or by the remote control unit.
*Orientation Sensor—the robot can detect whether it has fallen over. The orientation sensor also contributes to the robot's mood.
*Encoders (12)- three per leg, position legs.
*Dynamic Drive feedback-it can sense when its limbs are jammed and take action to free itself.
*Light Sensor (back)— for use in mood and behavior calculations. The light sensor can also detect petting and can initiate behavior.

==Basic Functions==

i-Cybies can be programmed to respond to the voice commands of a specific user. Voice control is a form of [[speech recognition]] that is "speaker dependent".  The RSC 300/364 microcontroller can process commands in any spoken language and features [[biometric]] authentication.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.13thmonkey.org/documentation/hardware/chips/80-0116.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are 8 voice commands listed in the manual allowing the user to initiate 8 different behavior categories. In addition to voice, i-Cybies can hear sharp sounds and localize the general direction of the source. It can also count the number of hand claps given in clap command mode (play mode) and respond with the same number of barks. i-Cybie can also detected when it has fallen over and automatically stand back up. It has the ability to detect when it is in a confined space or if it has become snagged against an obstacle. i-Cybie can "see" movement when in guard mode ([[motion detection]]) using a light sensor in its nose and it can also detect ambient light levels and movement using a light sensor in its back. i-Cybie uses several gaits for walking and among its numerous actions it can sit, roll on its side, and stand on its head.  Other features include [[edge detection]] (a special mode) and [[collision avoidance system|collision avoidance]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/I-Cybie_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; i-Cybie can detect its battery charge and will shut down when battery power is low or if equipped with a Walk Up Charger and programmable cartridge it will automatically seek out its charger and recharge itself.

i-Cybie uses five states or "moods" to determine autonomous behavior: happy, sad, sleepy, sick, and hyper. Moods are calculated based upon the cumulative count of interactions derived from the sensors. Users can tell the current mood/state by eye color, posture and type of behavior (i.e. yawning when sleepy or peeing when sick). I-Cybie is advertised as developing or evolving according to the environment and user treatment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/I-Cybie_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

i-Cybie accepts signals from an [[infrared]] [[remote control]] unit (RCU) and was designed to “communicate” with [[Silverlit]]'s robo-chi toys by transmitting and receiving IR signals using its chest array. There are several modes that are specific to the remote including play, stay, and guard mode. The remote is also used for "training" the robotic toy's voice recognition feature and for setting the pause mode.

==Cartridge==

I-Cybies were originally sold with a "dummy" cartridge inserted in a programming port on the robot's right side. A fully programmable cartridge was included with the Silverlit Downloader and Walk Up Charger accessories which were sold separately (they were later bundled with the robot). The cartridge adds specific actions for navigation to the Walk Up Charger and a special charger approach routine.  It can also be programmed with the Silverlit Downloader accessory to expand the robot's autonomous behavior with actions that are not part of i-Cybie's standard suite. With a programmable cartridge inserted i-Cybie can sense its battery charge and if it is low, the robot will autonomously locate its charger and dock.  After charging the i-Cybie will back away from the charger and resume autonomous operation.  [[Tiger Electronics]] programmable cartridges were populated with two 1 Mbit SST39vf010 chips with a total capacity of 256KB of flash [[Read-only memory|ROM]].&lt;ref&gt;http://servo.texterity.com/servo/200312/?pg=13#pg13&lt;/ref&gt;  The cartridge stores extra motion data and can be used to store additional audio files.&lt;ref&gt;http://servo.texterity.com/servo/200312/?pg=13#pg13&lt;/ref&gt; (Late cartridges are populated with a single 2 Mbit SST39vf200 chip which will not program successfully in a standard Super iCybie).  Late single chip carts can now be programmed by an updated SIC.  A new CROMINST is available in the downloads of www.icybie.net16.net, which can be used to create a SIC which can program single chip carts, but the SIC MUST be an older style, dual-chip dog, as making a SIC from a single chip dog is as yet untested.  In addition, a new walkup cart firmware was identified, indicating the newer single chip dogs may have a different firmware to the older i-cybie.

==Custom personalities==

Although i-Cybies were designed to be programmed to individual tastes, [[Silverlit]] and [[Hasbro]] ([[Tiger Electronics]]' parent company) provided little support for development of this feature beyond the release of the Downloader and associated Downloader software. Faced with this deficit, users developed their own tools for modifying the robot's behavior. A group of dedicated [[modders]] and [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hackers]] provided unofficial support for i-Cybie during its early years on the market.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1180411,00.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The result was that a number of software and hardware tools were created to allow users to manipulate i-Cybie's behavior.

YICT (Yanni Idolizes iCybie Tweeking) is a program based on the reverse-engineering efforts of a robot enthusiast known as "Aibopet" and is one of the user-developed tools designed to program a cartridge using either a [[Silverlit]] Downloader or a Super-i-Cybie.&lt;ref&gt;http://servo.texterity.com/servo/200312/?pg=13#pg13&lt;/ref&gt; An exploration of the functions allowed in YICT has revealed details about i-Cybie's programming logic and action categories that are not part of the general documentation. YICT also allows users to add more actions to each mood and change the overall behavior.&lt;ref&gt;http://servo.texterity.com/servo/200312/?pg=13#pg13&lt;/ref&gt; The YICT version 2.02 software contains a number of personalities for users to build upon (example: the Z/2 personality) and is a major source for early [[user group]] developed personalities.

==Super-I-Cybie==

It is possible to hack [[Tiger Electronics|Tiger]]/[[Silverlit]] model i-Cybies and make them capable of writing directly to a programmable cartridge without the use of the downloader. This modified i-Cybie is called a "Super" i-Cybie (SIC) by its creator Aibopet. In general, the hack involves soldering a communications port to traces near the main [[CPU]] and installing a boot loader (CROMINST) that has been pre-loaded on a programmable cartridge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hackinglab.org/icybie/index_icybie.html&lt;/ref&gt; The one time process makes it possible for the robot to be programmed with a new personality and to serve as a programmer (downloader) for other i-Cybies.  Users have noted that the [[Outrageous International]] i-Cybie cannot be hacked in this manner. A Super i-Cybie can also be completely reprogrammed in C language "from the ground up" with a user developed software development kit (ICSDK) to create new firmware.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aibohack.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Firmware and hardware==

The i-Cybie firmware was designed by Micom tech HK on behalf of Tiger.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.micomtech.com.hk/&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research by i-Cybie Fans has determined that [[Hasbro]] owns the firmware rights, having acquired Tiger.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1998/feb/10/hasbro-to-acquire-tiger-electronics/&lt;/ref&gt;   There appear to be three models of i-Cybie; 88011 (Tiger/Silverlit), 88012 (Silverlit) and 88013 (Outrageous/Silverlit).&lt;ref&gt;http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=2205006807&amp;tracelog=newcardfavirate&lt;/ref&gt;  Each model displays minor differences in component arrangement and structural detail and there are several circuit board versions for each model. It is not generally known whether there is a noticeable difference in firmware between models based on these differences.

==History==

The [[Hong Kong]] based Toy Company [[Silverlit]] built the prototype i-Cybie and presented it at the 1999 [[American International Toy Fair]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rainycity.com/i-cybie/news-release-on-icybie.htm
&lt;/ref&gt; The early prototypes looked very similar to [[Sony]]’s [[ERS-110]] in appearance but were meant to compete at a significantly lower consumer price. [[Tiger Electronics]] acquired the rights to distribute i-Cybie in 2000 and spent more than 2 million dollars to further develop the robot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rainycity.com/i-cybie/news-release-on-icybie.htm
&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger subsequently redesigned the prototype i-Cybie to make it look more like a dog and less like the [[AIBO]] ERS 110.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rainycity.com/i-cybie/news-release-on-icybie.htm
&lt;/ref&gt; A team of programmers led by [[Andy Filo]] reprogrammed i-Cybie to walk, interact, and to exhibit lifelike characteristics. The electronic pet was first released in January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rainycity.com/i-cybie/news-release-on-icybie.htm
&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally i-Cybies were sold with a plug-in charger, a remote, a rechargeable 12 volt nickel metal cadmium battery and a “dummy” cartridge. In 2002 the Walk Up Charger and the Downloader, each sold with a programmable cartridge, were released as accessories. The robotic toy was offered in two colors; metallic blue and metallic gold. In 2002 new shell options were offered including black, white, and transparent. The price point for i-Cybie was set at US$200, significantly less than the price for its chief robotic competitor at the time, the [[Sony]] [[AIBO]] ERS 111, then priced at more than US$1500.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.servomagazine.com/contentFrame.php?83&lt;/ref&gt; The i-Cybie robotic pet was set to be on the shelves in December 2000 in time for the seasonal increase in consumer spending. However, difficulties in development caused [[Tiger Electronics]] to postpone the initial release to early 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rainycity.com/i-cybie/news-release-on-icybie.htm
&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after its debut consumers reported that an "error" in the original quick start manual instructed owners to charge the batteries ten hours.  The time was not consistent with the recommended charge time for the charger (300ma) and the battery (800mah) released with the robot. The reported error allegedly resulted in some batteries being overcharged by users and rendered useless. Negative customer reviews may have effected some sales. Silverlit appears to have addressed this issue with the release of a "smart" battery charger accessory by 2002 and a higher capacity nickel metal hydride battery. Tiger Electronics discontinued support for i-Cybie soon after its release due to poor sales.  Silverlit continued to support the robot and released new shell options, a Walk-Up Charger and Downloader as promised upgrades.

[[Outrageous International Hong Kong]] relaunched i-Cybie in 2005 with the promise of improved features and a rumor circulated among i-Cybie fan sites of a new furry "x-Cybie" shell option for 2006. Although some Outrageous i-Cybies were made, only a few were released with fur (flock) covering. In 2006 the product was listed as discontinued in Western markets but some Chinese websites still list new i-Cybie's available for sale in China. As of Spring 2014, [[Silverlit]] still offered support for the robot and carried the Walk Up Charger, Downloader and other accessories for i-Cybie at their international 3deshop website.

Throughout its production run i-Cybies were compared to [[Sony]]'s [[Aibo]] entertainment robots.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rainycity.com/i-cybie/news-release-on-icybie.htm
&lt;/ref&gt; Although both devices share many features, in general [[AIBO]]s are more mechanically complex and they have a more powerful and versatile CPU. The [[AIBO]] series also use a vision system that is capable of tracking color and they possess a comparatively large suite of behavior that takes advantage of their vision abilities. Beyond its infrared collision avoidance, the i-Cybie does not have a vision system and its behavioral suite is comparatively limited. However, the i-Cybie pioneered features found in later robotic pets such as speech recognition and autonomous recharging.

Soon after i-Cybie's release a small [[user group]] community developed with the intent of enhancing i-Cybie's features.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1180411,00.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Although some success was made in creating tools to manipulate the toy robot's software, lack of official support and development led the community to eventually disband.

==Education==

Because of the low cost versus technological capabilities, i-Cybies have been used by universities to teach programming and robotics. Notable examples include the work of France Cadet, an artist and Associate Professor &amp; Chair (Art &amp; Technology department)at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Known for her robotic and bio-oriented multi-media installations, Cadet has featured i-Cybies in many of her art exhibits worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://cyberdoll.free.fr/cyberdoll/index_e_doglab01.html&lt;/ref&gt; Natalie Jeremijenko's Feral Dogs Project teaches students ecology at the University of California San Diego using i-Cybies modified with pollution sensors to seek out chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;http://inhabitat.com/robotic-pollution-sniffing-eco-dogs/&lt;/ref&gt; Recently (prior to 2010) inventor Andy Filo was interviewed and commented "[i-Cybie] is still probably one of the most complex toys that was ever sold on the toy isle".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YRq5qd5nDM&lt;/ref&gt;

Among self-developed series of products are following: ''Beetle Bug'', ''Lost Lagoon'', ''Insider Tales'', ''Diamond Drop'' etc.

Intenium advertises on TV regularly to promote both its own services and specific games from its portfolio. Key partners for such marketing activities are German TV channels such as [[ProsiebenSat.1]], [[RTL Television|RTL]] and [[RTL II|RTL2]], as well as French [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]]. Furthermore, this cooperation embraces also presence on the internet portals of TV channels where sections with casual games from Intenium’s portfolio are presented. These portals provide popular information and entertaining resources for mainstream audiences.

On November 18, 2011, Intenium GmbH was awarded the honorary prize «The best Russian mid-size company in Germany» by the German-Russian Chamber of Commerce (AHK). With this award, AHK singles out the innovation in strengthening Russian-German relations by the casual games developer and publisher as well as entrepreneurial spirit of the company's Founder Konstantin Nikulin. This award is given out every two years. AHK strives to recognize excellence and innovation of medium-sized and family-run German and Russian companies.

== Business model ==
The main business model of Intenium is [[freemium]] in which a product or service is provided free of charge, but a premium is charged for advanced features and/or functionality, [[item-selling]] or subscription.&lt;ref&gt;JLM de la Iglesia, JEL Gayo, "''Doing business by selling free services''". Web 2.0: The Business Model, 2008. Springer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hayes, "''Jump Point: How Network Culture is Revolutionizing Business''". 2008. Page 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Downloadable games played for Intenium historically a big role as Intenium's business started with those. Therefore, the business model called [[try before you buy]] is also widely used in company in its classical offerings. [[Try before you buy]] provides to users a download option without payment on a trial basis (play limited by time). The aim of this model is to give buyers the opportunity to play and judge the game before purchasing a license (i.e. to pay the price of game) for the full version. The software distributed on this basis is also called shareware.

Furthermore, Intenium’s own CDs are carried by retailers under «Deutschland-spielt» brand.

== Distribution network ==
The distribution network of Intenium comprises own national Deutschland-Spielt and own international casual games portals as well as internationally-active partner portals in USA, UK, France, Scandinavia, Russia and the Netherlands as well as Bild.de and Sat1.de, bringing gaming section to their portals based on Game Center technology. Which is all in one: valuable marketing instrument, easy customizable white label solution for portals, secure DRM software and keep in contact with users, once installed a game, using Tray Client system notification.

== Future of casual gaming industry ==
Online games are booming across all sectors of gaming market. [[Free-to-play]] become the major distribution model. Social, casual, mobile games and online games merge.

In future there might be the only one difference between the games: whether they are casual or hardcore - platform will not matter. Top games will be available at any time, on any platform, at any place. Development and improvement of multiplatform technologies will make it possible. Social in-game interactions already now play huge role (playing with friends, sending gifts, help requests etc.)

== Alamandi ==
[[Image:Alamandi.png|thumb|190px| «World of Alamandi»]]

«Alamandi» represents multiplayer online world that is targeted at core casual game consumers.

'''Interfax Ltd.''' ({{lang-ru|Интерфакс}}) is a [[Private limited company|privately-held]] independent major [[news agency]] in [[Russia]] (along with state-operated [[Russian News Agency TASS|TASS]] and [[RIA Novosti]]) and information services company [[headquarter]]ed in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=636458 |title=''Интеллектуальная собственность'' |author=Воронов А. |date=2005-12-17 |publisher=— [[Kommersant]] |accessdate=2011-01-29 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/684DBaXfH?url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/636458 |archivedate=2012-05-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interfax provides general and political news, business [[credit information]], industry analysis, [[market data]] and [[Business service provider|business solutions]] for [[Risk management|risk]], compliance and [[Credit manager|credit]] management. The company employs over 1,000 staff in over 70 bureaus worldwide and publishes over 3,000 stories each day.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax.com/txt.asp?rbr=1|title=''About Interfax''|author=|date=|publisher=— Interfax Group official site.|accessdate=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interfax controls around 50% of the Russian [[Organizational memory|corporate data market]].&lt;ref name="rbc"&gt;[http://marketing.rbc.ru/reviews/it-business/chapter_3_4.shtml Информационно-справочные системы]. - [[RBC Information Systems|RBC]].Marketing. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Subscription business model|Subscription-based]] business and [[financial intelligence]] contribute to the bulk of the revenues generated by Interfax with [[Information technology|IT]]-analytical business solutions accounting for approximately 75% of revenue.&lt;ref name="yourinterfax"&gt;Комиссар М.

'Interfax [[Holding company|Group]]' comprises more than 30 news producing and marketing companies in [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Belarus]], [[Azerbaijan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Germany]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="beneficiary"&gt;Гавшина О., Товкайло М. ''[https://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2012/01/19/lgota_dlya_smi Из списка подлежащих раскрытию бенефициаров сделали исключения]''. — [[Vedomosti]], January 19, 2012. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Interfax was formed in September 1989, during [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]’s ''[[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]]'' period, by [[Mikhail Komissar]] and his colleagues from [[international broadcasting]] station '[[Radio Moscow]]', a part of Soviet [[Gosteleradio]] system. Interfax originally used [[Fax|fax machines]] for text transmission, hence the company name.&lt;ref name="vestiru"&gt;''[http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=314295 Михаил Комиссар: задача «Интерфакса» — быть номером один]''. — TV-channel '[[Russia-24]]', 9 September 2009. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, Interfax had 100 subscribers and the agency quickly began to attract the attention of conservatives within the government, who attempted to shut down the agency.

Interfax continued to expand in the 1990s, adding [[subsidiary]] agencies for [[Financial market|financial]], [[Metallurgical industry|metallurgical]], [[Energy industry|oil and gas]] markets, information products on [[agriculture]], [[business law]], [[transport]], [[telecommunications]],&lt;ref name="vestiru" /&gt; and the market data terminal 'EFiR information system' for [[stock market]] players to its general news coverage.&lt;ref name="efir"&gt;''[http://www.ideal.ru/text.asp?Rbr=1 About]''. — Official site of EFiR system. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interfax also opened subsidiaries across the [[post-Soviet states]], first in Ukraine (1992), Belarus (1993) and Kazakhstan (1996), and later in Azerbaijan (2002),&lt;ref name="history"&gt;''[http://group.interfax.ru/history.asp?rbr=9 Our history]''. — Official site of Interfax Group. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; during this time bringing the number of local offices across the [[Subdivisions of Russia|regions of Russian Federation]] to 50.&lt;ref name="politcom"&gt;''[http://politcom.ru/3331.html Михаил Комиссар: «Надеюсь, в России установится баланс между либеральным и государственным»]''. — Politcom.ru, 1 September 2006. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To promote its information products abroad, Interfax opened its first company outside the former USSR in 1991, when 'Interfax America' was opened in [[Denver]], CO. This was followed by the opening of [[London]]-based 'Interfax Europe Ltd.' (1992), 'Interfax Germany GmbH', based in [[Frankfurt]] (1993), and the 'Interfax News Service Ltd.' in [[Hong Kong]] (1998).&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

In 2004, Interfax created the 'SPARK system' designed to check [[Business manager|business agents]] in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan,&lt;ref name="sparc"&gt;''[http://group.interfax.ru/rbr.asp?rbr=34 Информация по юридическим лицам РФ, Украины и Казахстана]''. — Official site of Interfax Group. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interfax also launched [[media monitoring]] services through its 'SCAN system'.&lt;ref name="ucb"&gt;''[http://www.bki-okb.ru/about?lang=en About]''. — Official site of United Credit Bureau.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the company added London-based project, 'Interfax Global Energy', which reports on the [[energy market]]s worldwide.&lt;ref name="ige"&gt;''[http://interfaxenergy.com/about Interfax Global Energy]''. — Official site of Interfax Global Energy.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==

In 1999, Interfax launched a [[rating agency]] in partnership with '[[Moody's Investors Service]]' to provide rating services on the [[Russian market]].&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; SPARK system became the basis for a [[joint venture]] with a provider of [[Credit risk|business credit information]] and [[credit report]]s '[[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]]'.&lt;ref name="dandb"&gt;''[http://group.interfax.ru/rbr.asp?rbr=35 Информация по компаниям всего мира]''. — Official site of Interfax Group. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001 Interfax has collaborated with '[[Business Wire]]', a global leader in the distribution of [[Prospectus (finance)|corporate regulatory disclosures]] and [[press release]]s.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; Interfax now also offers consumer [[credit report]]s via a joint venture with '[[Experian]]' and '[[Sberbank of Russia]]'.&lt;ref name="ucb"&gt;''[http://www.bki-okb.ru/about?lang=en About]''. — Official site of United Credit Bureau.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management == 
'Interfax Group' [[senior management]] includes [[Mikhail Komissar]] as [[Chairman of the Board]] and [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]], Vladimir Gerasimov, [[Executive Director]] and General Director of Financial and Business Information Service, Georgy Gulia, Executive Director of General Information Service.&lt;ref name="persons"&gt;''[http://www.group.interfax.ru/persons.asp?rbr=8&amp;tp=1 Management]''. — Official site of Interfax Group. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The Internet and the WWW are different concepts – please do not muddle them in this article :) --&gt;
The '''Internet''' is the global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s that use the [[Internet protocol suite]] (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a ''network of networks'' that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked [[hypertext]] documents and [[Web application|applications]] of the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW), [[email|electronic mail]], [[voice over IP|telephony]], and [[file sharing]].

The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the [[federal government of the United States]] in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication with computer networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_ipto.htm "IPTO – Information Processing Techniques Office"], ''The Living Internet'', Bill Stewart (ed), January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary precursor network, the [[ARPANET]], initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s. The funding of the [[National Science Foundation Network]] as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_summary.htm "Internet History -- One Page Summary"], ''The Living Internet'', Bill Stewart (ed), January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nethistory.info/History%20of%20the%20Internet/origins.html "So, who really did invent the Internet?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903001108/http://www.nethistory.info/History%20of%20the%20Internet/origins.html |date=3 September 2011 }}, Ian Peter, The Internet History Project, 2004. Retrieved 27 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, [[personal computer|personal]], and [[mobile device|mobile]] computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by [[academia]] since the 1980s, [[commercialization of the Internet|commercialization]] incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life.

Most traditional communications media, including telephony, radio, television, paper mail and newspapers are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as [[email]], [[Internet telephony]], [[Internet television]], [[online music]], digital newspapers, and [[video streaming]] websites. Newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to [[Web site|website]] technology, or are reshaped into [[blogging]], [[web feed]]s and online [[news aggregator]]s. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through [[instant messaging]], [[Internet forum]]s, and [[social network service|social networking]]. [[Online shopping]] has grown exponentially both for major retailers and [[small business]]es and [[entrepreneur]]s, as it enables firms to extend their "[[brick and mortar]]" presence to serve a larger market or even [[Online store|sell goods and services entirely online]].  [[Business-to-business]] and [[financial services]] on the Internet affect [[supply chain]]s across entire industries.

The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/who-owns-internet.htm "Who owns the Internet?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619070159/http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/who-owns-internet.htm |date=19 June 2014 }}, Jonathan Strickland, ''How Stuff Works''.

The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise.&lt;ref&gt;"The Tao of IETF: A Novice's Guide to Internet Engineering Task Force", P. Hoffman and S. Harris, {{IETF RFC|4677}}, September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, the Internet was included on ''[[USA Today]]'''s list of ''[[Wonders of the World#USA Today's New Seven Wonders|New Seven Wonders]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2006-10-26-seven-wonders-experts_x.htm |title=New Seven Wonders panel |work=USA Today |date=October 27, 2006 |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Capitalization of "Internet"}}

When the term ''Internet'' is used to refer to the specific global system of interconnected [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) networks, the word is a [[proper noun]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/about16_rules.html The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th Edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527060356/http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/about16_rules.html |date=27 May 2013 }}: "capitalize World Wide Web and Internet"&lt;/ref&gt; that should be written with an initial [[capital letter]]. In common use and the media, it is often erroneously not capitalized, viz. ''the internet.'' Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized when used as a noun, but not capitalized when used as an adjective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/16/ch07/ch07_sec076.html?para= "7.76 Terms like 'web' and 'Internet'"], ''Chicago Manual of Style'', University of Chicago, 16th edition {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet is also often referred to as ''the Net'', as a short form of ''network''. Historically, as early as 1849, the word ''internetted'' was used uncapitalized as an adjective, meaning ''interconnected'' or ''interwoven''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Internetted}} nineteenth-century use as an adjective.&lt;/ref&gt; The designers of early computer networks used ''internet'' both as a noun and as a verb in shorthand form of [[internetwork]] or internetworking, meaning interconnecting computer networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Internetwork}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'' are often used interchangeably in everyday speech; it is common to speak of "''going on the Internet''" when using a [[web browser]] to view [[web page]]s. However, the [[World Wide Web]] or ''the Web'' is only one of a large number of Internet services. The Web is a collection of interconnected documents (web pages) and other [[web resource]]s, linked by [[hyperlink]]s and [[uniform resource locator|URLs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#h-12.1 |accessdate=13 August 2008 |work=HTML 4.01 Specification |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |title=HTML 4.01 Specification |quote=[T]he link (or hyperlink, or Web link) [is] the basic hypertext construct.

The Internet is a [[global network]] that comprises many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body. The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]) is an activity of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. To maintain interoperability, the principal [[name space]]s of the Internet are administered by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including [[domain name]]s, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet.  This role of ICANN distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Hans. (2004).

[[File:World map of submarine cables.png|thumb|2007 map showing submarine fiberoptic telecommunication cables around the world.]]
The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture.

=== Routing and service tiers ===
[[File:Internet Connectivity Distribution &amp; Core.svg|thumb|Packet routing across the Internet involves several tiers of Internet service providers.]]

[[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks at various levels of scope. End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy. At the top of the routing hierarchy are the [[tier 1 network]]s, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via very high speed [[fibre optic cable]]s and governed by [[peering]] agreements. [[Tier 2 network|Tier 2]] and lower level networks buy [[Internet transit]] from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement [[multihoming]] to achieve redundancy and load balancing. [[Internet exchange point]]s are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs. Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as [[GEANT]], [[GLORIAD]], [[Internet2]], and the UK's [[national research and education network]], [[JANET]]. Both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of [[scale-free network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Access ===
Common methods of [[Internet access]] by users include dial-up with a computer [[modem]] via telephone circuits, [[Broadband Internet access|broadband]] over [[coaxial cable]], [[Optical fiber|fiber optics]] or copper wires, [[Wi-Fi]], [[Satellite Internet|satellite]], and [[mobile telephony|cellular telephone]] technology (e.g. [[3G]], [[4G]]). The Internet may often be accessed from computers in libraries and [[Internet cafe]]s. [[Internet kiosk|Internet access points]] exist in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops. Various terms are used, such as ''public Internet kiosk'', ''public access terminal'', and ''Web [[payphone]]''. Many hotels also have public terminals that are usually fee-based. These terminals are widely accessed for various usages, such as ticket booking, bank deposit, or online payment. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to the Internet via local computer networks. [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|Hotspots]] providing such access include [[Wi-Fi#Internet access|Wi-Fi cafes]], where users need to bring their own wireless devices such as a laptop or [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]. These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based.

[[Grassroots]] efforts have led to [[wireless community network]]s. Commercial Wi-Fi services covering large city areas are in many cities, such as [[New York City|New York]], [[London]], [[Vienna]], [[Toronto]], [[San Francisco]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Chicago]] and [[Pittsburgh]]. The Internet can then be accessed from places, such as a park bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pasternak |first=Sean B. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000082&amp;sid=aQ0ZfhMa4XGQ |title=Toronto Hydro to Install Wireless Network in Downtown Toronto |publisher=Bloomberg |date=7 March 2006 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060410104717/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000082&amp;sid=aQ0ZfhMa4XGQ |archivedate=10 April 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Wi-Fi, there have been experiments with proprietary mobile wireless networks like [[Ricochet (Internet service)|Ricochet]], various high-speed data services over cellular phone networks, and fixed wireless services.

Fragmentation restricts access to media content and tends to affect poorest users the most.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Zero-rating]], the practice of [[Internet service provider|internet providers]] allowing users free connectivity to access specific content or applications for free, has offered some opportunities for individuals to surmount economic hurdles, but has also been accused by its critics as creating a 'two-tiered' internet. To address the issues with zero-rating, an alternative model has emerged in the concept of 'equal rating' and is being tested in experiments by [[Mozilla]] and [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] in [[Africa]]. Equal rating prevents prioritization of one type of content and zero-rates all content up to a specified data cap. A study published by [[Chatham House]], 15 out of 19 countries researched in [[Latin America]] had some kind of hybrid or zero-rated product offered. Some countries in the region had a handful of plans to choose from (across all mobile network operators) while others, such as [[Colombia]], offered as many as 30 pre-paid and 34 post-paid plans.&lt;ref&gt;Galpaya, Helani. 2017.

While the hardware components in the Internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/ |title=IETF Home Page |publisher=Ietf.org |accessdate=20 June 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618032558/http://www.ietf.org/ |archivedate=18 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting contributions and standards are published as ''[[Request for Comments]]'' (RFC) documents on the IETF web site. The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the [[Internet Standard]]s. Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.

The Internet standards describe a framework known as the [[Internet protocol suite]]. This is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system of protocols, originally documented in {{IETF RFC|1122}} and {{IETF RFC|1123}}. The layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the [[application layer]], space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. For example, a web browser program uses the [[client-server]] application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a [[peer-to-peer]] paradigm. Below this top layer, the [[transport layer]] connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with appropriate data exchange methods.

Underlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and exchange traffic across them. The [[Internet layer]] enables computers ("hosts") to identify each other via [[IP address|Internet Protocol (IP) addresses]], and route their traffic to each other via any intermediate (transit) networks. Last, at the bottom of the architecture is the [[link layer]], which provides logical connectivity between hosts on the same network link, such as a [[local area network]] (LAN) or a [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up connection]]. The model, also known as [[TCP/IP]], is designed to be independent of the underlying hardware used for the physical connections, which the model does not concern itself with in any detail. Other models have been developed, such as the [[OSI model]], that attempt to be comprehensive in every aspect of communications. While many similarities exist between the models, they are not compatible in the details of description or implementation. Yet, TCP/IP protocols are usually included in the discussion of OSI networking.

[[File:UDP encapsulation.svg|thumb|As user data is processed through the protocol stack, each abstraction layer adds encapsulation information at the sending host. Data is transmitted ''over the wire'' at the link level between hosts and routers. Encapsulation is removed by the receiving host. Intermediate relays update link encapsulation at each hop, and inspect the IP layer for routing purposes.]]

The most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP), which provides addressing systems, including [[IP address]]es, for computers on the network. IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) is the initial version used on the first generation of the Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed to address up to ~4.3 billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to [[IPv4 address exhaustion]], which entered its final stage in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huston |first=Geoff |title=IPv4 Address Report, daily generated |url=http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html |accessdate=20 May 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401001902/http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html |archivedate=1 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the global address allocation pool was exhausted.  A new protocol version, IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic. [[IPv6]] is currently in growing [[IPv6 deployment|deployment]] around the world, since Internet address registries ([[Regional Internet registry|RIRs]]) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arin.net/knowledge/about_resources/ceo_letter.pdf |title=Notice of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Address Depletion |format=PDF |accessdate=7 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107095025/https://www.arin.net/knowledge/about_resources/ceo_letter.pdf |archivedate=7 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPv6 is not directly interoperable by design with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., [[peering agreement]]s, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.

== Services ==
Many people use, erroneously, the terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'', or just the ''Web'', interchangeably, but the two terms are not synonymous. The [[World Wide Web]] is a primary application program that billions of people use on the Internet, and it has changed their lives immeasurably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''World Wide Web Timeline'' |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/03/11/world-wide-web-timeline/ |date=11 March 2014 |publisher=Pews Research Center |accessdate=1 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150729162322/http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/03/11/world-wide-web-timeline/ |archivedate=29 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Website Analytics Tool'' |url=http://www.internetlivestats.com/ |accessdate=1 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702051222/http://www.internetlivestats.com/ |archivedate=2 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Internet provides many [[network service]]s, most prominently include [[mobile app]]s such as [[social media]] apps, the [[World Wide Web]], [[electronic mail]], [[multiplayer online game]]s, [[Internet telephony]], and [[file sharing]] and [[streaming media]] services.

=== World Wide Web ===
{{Main|World Wide Web}}
[[File:First Web Server.jpg|thumb|This [[NeXT Computer]] was used by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]] and became the world's first [[Web server]].]]

World Wide Web browser software, such as [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]]/[[Microsoft Edge|Edge]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], and [[Google Chrome]], lets users navigate from one web page to another via hyperlinks embedded in the documents. These documents may also contain any combination of [[computer data]], including graphics, sounds, [[Plain text|text]], [[web video|video]], [[multimedia]] and interactive content that runs while the user is interacting with the page. [[Client-side scripting|Client-side software]] can include animations, [[web game|games]], [[office applications]] and scientific demonstrations. Through [[keyword (Internet search)|keyword]]-driven [[Internet research]] using [[Web search engine|search engines]] like [[Yahoo! Search|Yahoo!]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] and [[Google Search|Google]], users worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale.

The Web is therefore a global set of [[documents]], [[Computer graphics|images]] and other resources, logically interrelated by [[hyperlink]]s and referenced with [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]s (URIs). URIs symbolically identify services, [[web servers|servers]], and other databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web. [[Web service]]s also use HTTP to allow software systems to communicate in order to share and exchange business logic and data.

The Web has enabled individuals and organizations to [[publish]] ideas and information to a potentially large [[audience]] online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial [[cost]] and many cost-free services are available. However, publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition. Many individuals and some companies and groups use ''web logs'' or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage [[employees|staff]] to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result.

[[Online advertising|Advertising]] on popular web pages can be lucrative, and [[e-commerce]], which is the sale of products and services directly via the Web, continues to grow. Online advertising is a form of [[marketing]] and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver [[promotion (marketing)|promotional]] marketing messages to consumers.  It includes email marketing, [[search engine marketing]] (SEM), social media marketing, many types of [[display advertising]] (including [[web banner]] advertising), and [[mobile advertising]]. In 2011, Internet advertising revenues in the United States surpassed those of [[cable television]] and nearly exceeded those of [[broadcast television]].&lt;ref name="IAB2012"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iab.net/media/file/IAB_Internet_Advertising_Revenue_Report_FY_2012_rev.pdf |title= IAB internet advertising revenue report: 2012 full year results |date = April 2013 |publisher = PricewaterhouseCoopers, Internet Advertising Bureau |accessdate = 12 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} Many common online advertising practices are controversial and increasingly subject to regulation.

When the Web developed in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted in [[HTML]], complete for transmission to a web browser in response to a request. Over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic, creating a flexible design, layout, and content. Websites are often created using [[content management]] software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of an organization or the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual visitors view and read this content in HTML form. There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors.

=== Communication ===
[[Email]] is an important communications service available on the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties in a way analogous to mailing letters or memos predates the creation of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Brown, Fax invades the mail market, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&amp;pg=PA218 New Scientist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509050238/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&amp;pg=PA218 |date=2016-05-09 }}, Vol. 56, No. 817 (Oct., 26, 1972), pages 218–221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Luckett, What's News: Electronic-mail delivery gets started, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cKSqa8u3EIoC&amp;pg=PA85 Popular Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430021738/https://books.google.com/books?id=cKSqa8u3EIoC&amp;pg=PA85 |date=2016-04-30 }}, Vol. 202, No. 3 (March 1973); page 85&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures, documents, and other files are sent as [[email attachment]]s. Emails can be [[Carbon copy|cc-ed]] to multiple [[email address]]es.

[[Internet telephony]] is another common communications service made possible by the creation of the Internet. [[VoIP]] stands for Voice-over-[[Internet Protocol]], referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with [[walkie-talkie]]-like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as [[Cable modem|cable]] or [[ADSL]] and [[mobile data]].&lt;ref name=EBSCOhost&gt;{{cite journal|last=Booth|first=C|title=Chapter 2: IP Phones, Software VoIP, and Integrated and Mobile VoIP|journal=Library Technology Reports|year=2010|volume=46|issue=5|pages=11–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.

Voice quality can still vary from call to call, but is often equal to and can even exceed that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include [[emergency telephone number]] dialing and reliability. Currently, a few VoIP providers provide an emergency service, but it is not universally available. Older traditional phones with no "extra features" may be line-powered only and operate during a power failure; VoIP can never do so without a [[uninterruptible power supply|backup power source]] for the phone equipment and the Internet access devices. VoIP has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication between players. Popular VoIP clients for gaming include [[Ventrilo]] and [[Teamspeak]]. Modern video game consoles also offer VoIP chat features.

=== Data transfer ===
[[File sharing]] is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A [[computer file]] can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a "shared location" or onto a [[file server]] for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of "[[Web mirror|mirror]]" servers or [[peer-to-peer]] networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user [[authentication]], the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by [[encryption]], and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed – usually fully encrypted – across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by [[digital signature]]s or by [[MD5]] or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.

[[Streaming media]] is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet "broadcasters" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical [[webcast]]s to on-demand popular multimedia services. [[Podcast]]ing is a variation on this theme, where – usually audio – material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a [[portable media player]] to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.

Digital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth.  For example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbit/s for 1080p.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrison |first=Geoff |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40241749/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets |title=What to know before buying a 'connected' TV – Technology &amp; science – Tech and gadgets – Tech Holiday Guide |publisher=MSNBC |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628201811/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40241749/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets |archivedate=28 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Webcam]]s are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the [[Panama Canal]], traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. Video [[chat rooms]] and [[video conferencing]] are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with a vast number of users. It uses a HTML5 based web player by default to stream and show video files.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://youtube-eng.googleblog.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html|title=YouTube now defaults to HTML5 &lt;video&gt;|work=YouTube Engineering and Developers Blog|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile. [[YouTube]] claims that its users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily.

== Social impact ==
The Internet has enabled new forms of social interaction, activities, and social associations. This phenomenon has given rise to the scholarly study of the [[sociology of the Internet]].

Internet usage has seen tremendous growth. From 2000 to 2009, the number of Internet users globally rose from 394 million to 1.858 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/ Internet users graphs], Market Information and Statistics, International Telecommunications Union&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, 22 percent of the world's population had access to computers with 1 billion [[Google]] searches every day, 300 million Internet users reading blogs, and 2 billion videos viewed daily on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/71940/google-earth-demonstrates-how-technology-benefits-ris-civil-society-govt |title=Google Earth demonstrates how technology benefits RI's civil society, govt |publisher=Antara News |date=2011-05-26 |accessdate=2012-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029074528/http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/71940/google-earth-demonstrates-how-technology-benefits-ris-civil-society-govt |archivedate=29 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the world's Internet users surpassed 3 billion or 43.6 percent of world population, but two-thirds of the users came from richest countries, with 78.0 percent of Europe countries population using the Internet, followed by 57.4 percent of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/25/3-billion-internet-users/ |title=There are now 3 billion internet users, mostly in rich countries |author=Steve Dent |accessdate=25 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128020032/http://www.engadget.com/2014/11/25/3-billion-internet-users/ |archivedate=28 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalent language for communication on the Internet has been English. This may be a result of the origin of the Internet, as well as the language's role as a [[lingua franca]]. Early computer systems were limited to the characters in the [[ASCII|American Standard Code for Information Interchange]] (ASCII), a subset of the [[Latin alphabet]].

After English (27%), the most requested languages on the [[World Wide Web]] are Chinese (25%), Spanish (8%), Japanese (5%), Portuguese and German (4% each), Arabic, French and Russian (3% each), and Korean (2%).&lt;ref name="NIUBL-IWS" /&gt;&lt;!-- Note that the use of these copyright statistics is dependent on "giving due credit and establishing an active link back to www.internetworldstats.com", so please do not remove the citation above --&gt; By region, 42% of the world's [[Internet users]] are based in Asia, 24% in Europe, 14% in North America, 10% in Latin America and the [[Caribbean]] taken together, 6% in Africa, 3% in the Middle East and 1% in Australia/Oceania.&lt;ref name=inetstats&gt;[http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm World Internet Usage Statistics News and Population Stats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319013935/http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm |date=19 March 2017 }} updated for 30 June 2010.

However, some glitches such as ''[[mojibake]]'' (incorrect display of some languages' characters) still remain.

In an American study in 2005, the percentage of men using the Internet was very slightly ahead of the percentage of women, although this difference reversed in those under 30. Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and were more likely to be broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email). Men were more likely to use the Internet to pay bills, participate in auctions, and for recreation such as downloading music and videos. Men and women were equally likely to use the Internet for shopping and banking.&lt;ref&gt;How men and women use the Internet Pew Research Center 28 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet allows greater flexibility in working hours and location, especially with the spread of unmetered high-speed connections. The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through [[mobile Internet device]]s. Mobile phones, [[datacard]]s, [[handheld game console]]s and [[cellular router]]s allow users to connect to the Internet [[wireless]]ly. Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.

Educational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from [[CBeebies]], through school and high-school revision guides and [[Virtual university|virtual universities]], to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of [[Google Scholar]]. For [[distance education]], help with [[homework]] and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the [[World Wide Web]] in particular are important enablers of both [[Education|formal]] and [[informal education]]. Further, the Internet allows universities, in particular, researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.&lt;ref&gt;Reips, U.-D.

The low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills have made [[collaboration|collaborative]] work dramatically easier, with the help of [[collaborative software]]. Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the [[free software movement]], which has produced, among other things, [[Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and [[OpenOffice.org]] (later forked into [[LibreOffice]]). Internet chat, whether using an [[IRC]] chat room, an [[instant messaging]] system, or a [[social networking]] website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day.  Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.

[[Content management]] systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work. Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and [[computer literacy]] spread.

The Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with [[computer security]], i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can [[audit]] the books of a company based in another country, on a [[server (computing)|server]] situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private [[leased line]]s would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using [[cloud computing]], or open a [[Remote Desktop Protocol|remote desktop]] session into their office PC using a secure [[virtual private network]] (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among [[system administrator]]s as the Virtual Private Nightmare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Virtual Private Nightmare: VPN |url=http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |publisher=Librenix |accessdate=21 July 2010 |date=4 August 2004 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515152637/http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.

=== Social networking and entertainment ===
{{See also|Social networking service#Social impact}}
Many people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to pursue their personal interests. People use [[online chat|chat]], messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. [[Social network service|Social networking]] websites such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Myspace]] have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like [[LinkedIn]] foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and [[Flickr]] specialize in users' videos and photographs. While social networking sites were initially for individuals only, today they are widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands, to market to their customers and to encourage posts to "[[Viral marketing|go viral]]". "Black hat" social media techniques are also employed by some organizations, such as [[Spamming|spam]] accounts and [[astroturfing]].

A risk for both individuals and organizations writing posts (especially public posts) on social networking websites, is that especially foolish or controversial posts occasionally lead to an unexpected and possibly large-scale backlash on social media from other Internet users. This is also a risk in relation to controversial ''offline'' behavior, if it is widely made known. The nature of this backlash can range widely from counter-arguments and public mockery, through insults and [[hate speech]], to, in extreme cases, rape and death [[Computer crime#Threats|threats]]. The [[online disinhibition effect]] describes the tendency of many individuals to behave more stridently or offensively online than they would in person. A significant number of [[feminist]] women have been the target of various forms of [[harassment]] in response to posts they have made on social media, and Twitter in particular has been criticised in the past for not doing enough to aid victims of online abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |title=Twitter 'report abuse' button calls after rape threats |last=Moore |first=Keith |date=27 July 2013 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=7 December 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904014545/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |archivedate=4 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For organizations, such a backlash can cause overall [[public relations|brand damage]], especially if reported by the media. However, this is not always the case, as any brand damage in the eyes of people with an opposing opinion to that presented by the organization could sometimes be outweighed by strengthening the brand in the eyes of others. Furthermore, if an organization or individual gives in to demands that others perceive as wrong-headed, that can then provoke a counter-backlash.

Some websites, such as [[Reddit]], have rules forbidding the posting of [[personal information]] of individuals (also known as [[doxxing]]), due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs of large numbers of Internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified. In particular, the Reddit rule forbidding the posting of personal information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be [[censored]] in Facebook [[screenshots]] posted to Reddit. However, the interpretation of this rule in relation to public Twitter posts is less clear, and in any case, like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each other's attention to public social media posts they disagree with.

Children also face dangers online such as [[cyberbullying]] and [[Child grooming|approaches by sexual predators]], who sometimes pose as children themselves. Children may also encounter material which they may find upsetting, or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate. Due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so. Many parents choose to enable [[Content-control software|Internet filtering]], and/or supervise their children's online activities, in an attempt to protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. The most popular social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, commonly forbid users under the age of 13. However, these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date, and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway. Social networking sites for younger children, which claim to provide better levels of protection for children, also exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2010/10/11/social-networks-children/ |title=5 Fun and Safe Social Networks for Children |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=7 December 2014 |website=[[Mashable]] |publisher= |last=Kessler |first=Sarah |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220082237/http://mashable.com/2010/10/11/social-networks-children/ |archivedate=20 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining [[social experiment]]s such as [[MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [[Usenet]] groups receiving much traffic.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Many [[Internet forums]] have sections devoted to games and funny videos.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The [[Internet pornography]] and [[online gambling]] industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web, and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com/internet-pornography-statistics.html "Internet Pornography Statistics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013032720/http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com/internet-pornography-statistics.html |date=13 October 2011 }}, Jerry Ropelato, Top Ten Reviews, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although many governments have attempted to restrict both industries' use of the Internet, in general, this has failed to stop their widespread popularity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/SmallBiz/story?id=4151592 "Do It Yourself!

Another area of leisure activity on the Internet is [[multiplayer gaming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://internetgames.about.com/od/gamingnews/a/trendsdecade.htm "Top Online Game Trends of the Decade"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929074221/http://internetgames.about.com/od/gamingnews/a/trendsdecade.htm |date=29 September 2011 }}, Dave Spohn, About.com, 15 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This form of recreation creates communities, where people of all ages and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from [[MMORPG]] to [[first-person shooter]]s, from [[role-playing video game]]s to [[online gambling]]. While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as [[GameSpy Arcade|GameSpy]] and [[MPlayer.com|MPlayer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://internetgames.about.com/od/gamingnews/a/timeline.htm "Internet Game Timeline: 1963 – 2004"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425091409/http://internetgames.about.com/od/gamingnews/a/timeline.htm |date=25 April 2006 }}, Dave Spohn, About.com, 2 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.

Internet usage has been correlated to users' loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Carole Hughes |author2=Boston College |url=https://www2.bc.edu/~hughesc/abstract.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107031736/https://www2.bc.edu/~hughesc/abstract.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 November 2015 |title=The Relationship Between Internet Use and Loneliness Among College Students |publisher=Boston College |accessdate=11 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lonely people tend to use the Internet as an outlet for their feelings and to share their stories with others, such as in the "[[I am lonely will anyone speak to me]]" thread.

[[Cybersectarianism]] is a new organizational form which involves: "highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader.  Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders.  Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in the collective study via email, on-line chat rooms, and web-based message boards."&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Thornton, "The New Cybersects: Resistance and Repression in the Reform era. " In Elizabeth Perry and Mark Selden, eds., ''Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance'' (second edition) (London and New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the British government has raised concerns about the prospect of young British Muslims being indoctrinated into Islamic extremism by material on the Internet, being persuaded to join [[terrorist]] groups such as the so-called "[[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]]", and then potentially committing acts of terrorism on returning to Britain after fighting in Syria or Iraq.

[[Cyberslacking]] can become a drain on corporate resources; the average UK employee spent 57 minutes a day surfing the Web while at work, according to a 2003 study by Peninsula Business Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/net-abuse-hits-small-city-firms-1-892163 |title=Net abuse hits small city firms |work=The Scotsman |date=11 September 2003 |accessdate=7 August 2009 |location=Edinburgh |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020041820/http://www.scotsman.com/news/net-abuse-hits-small-city-firms-1-892163 |archivedate=20 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet addiction disorder]] is excessive computer use that interferes with daily life.

=== Electronic business ===
[[Electronic business]] (''e-business'') encompasses business processes spanning the entire [[value chain]]: purchasing, [[supply chain management]], [[marketing]], [[sales]], [[customer]] service, and business relationship. [[E-commerce]] seeks to add revenue streams using the Internet to build and enhance relationships with clients and partners. According to [[International Data Corporation]], the size of worldwide e-commerce, when global business-to-business and -consumer transactions are combined, equate to $16 trillion for 2013. A report by Oxford Economics adds those two together to estimate the total size of the [[digital economy]] at $20.4 trillion, equivalent to roughly 13.8% of global sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myclouddoor.com/web/documents/The%20New%20Digital%20Economy.pdf "The New Digital Economy: How it will transform business"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706101452/http://www.myclouddoor.com/web/documents/The%20New%20Digital%20Economy.pdf |date=6 July 2014 }}, Oxford Economics, 2 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

While much has been written of the economic advantages of [[electronic commerce|Internet-enabled commerce]], there is also evidence that some aspects of the Internet such as maps and location-aware services may serve to reinforce [[economic inequality]] and the [[digital divide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Internet Reinforces Inequality in the Real World |work=The Atlantic |author=Badger, Emily |date=6 February 2013 |accessdate=2013-02-13 |url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2013/02/how-internet-reinforces-inequality-real-world/4602/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211095334/http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2013/02/how-internet-reinforces-inequality-real-world/4602/ |archivedate=11 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic commerce may be responsible for [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] and the decline of [[mom-and-pop]], [[brick and mortar]] businesses resulting in increases in [[income inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/e-commerce-will-make-the-shopping-mall-a-retail-wasteland-7000009960/ "E-commerce will make the shopping mall a retail wasteland"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219011301/http://www.zdnet.com/e-commerce-will-make-the-shopping-mall-a-retail-wasteland-7000009960/ |date=19 February 2013 }} ''ZDNet'', 17 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2012/12/Free_Shipping_Day_Promotion_Spurs_Late-Season_Online_Spending_Surge "‘Free Shipping Day’ Promotion Spurs Late-Season Online Spending Surge, Improving Season-to-Date Growth Rate to 16 Percent vs. Year Ago"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128191411/http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2012/12/Free_Shipping_Day_Promotion_Spurs_Late-Season_Online_Spending_Surge |date=28 January 2013 }} ''Comscore'', 23 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2012/12/death-american-shopping-mall/4252/ "The Death of the American Shopping Mall"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215044619/http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2012/12/death-american-shopping-mall/4252/ |date=15 February 2013 }} ''The Atlantic — Cities'', 26 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Andrew Keen]], a long-time critic of the social transformations caused by the Internet, has recently focused on the economic effects of consolidation from Internet businesses. Keen cites a 2013 [[Institute for Local Self-Reliance]] report saying brick-and-mortar retailers employ 47 people for every $10 million in sales while Amazon employs only 14. Similarly, the 700-employee room rental start-up [[Airbnb]] was valued at $10 billion in 2014, about half as much as [[Hilton Worldwide|Hilton Hotels]], which employs 152,000 people. And car-sharing Internet startup [[Uber (company)|Uber]] employs 1,000 full-time employees and is valued at $18.2 billion, about the same valuation as [[Avis Rent a Car System|Avis]] and [[The Hertz Corporation|Hertz]] combined, which together employ almost 60,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris |first1=Michael |title=Book review: 'The Internet Is Not the Answer' by Andrew Keen |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/book-review-the-internet-is-not-the-answer-by-andrew-keen/2015/01/02/8627999a-7973-11e4-9a27-6fdbc612bff8_story.html |accessdate=25 January 2015 |work=Washington Post |date=2 January 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120000258/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/book-review-the-internet-is-not-the-answer-by-andrew-keen/2015/01/02/8627999a-7973-11e4-9a27-6fdbc612bff8_story.html |archivedate=20 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommuting ===
[[Telecommuting]] is the performance within a traditional worker and employer relationship when it is facilitated by tools such as [[groupware]], [[virtual private networks]], [[conference calling]], [[videoconferencing]], and [[voice over IP]] (VOIP) so that work may be performed from any location, most conveniently the worker's home. It can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. As [[broadband]] Internet connections become commonplace, more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate [[intranet]] and internal communication networks.

The Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool. The presidential campaign of [[Howard Dean]] in 2004 in the United States was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the Internet. Many political groups use the Internet to achieve a new method of organizing for carrying out their mission, having given rise to [[Internet activism]], most notably practiced by rebels in the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref name=cascading&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/the-cascading-effects-of-the-arab-spring-28575/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227051329/http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/the-cascading-effects-of-the-arab-spring-28575/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 February 2011 |title=The Arab Uprising's Cascading Effects |publisher=Miller-mccune.com |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=27 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2011/chokoshvili_davit.pdf The Role of the Internet in Democratic Transition: Case Study of the Arab Spring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705155248/http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2011/chokoshvili_davit.pdf |date=5 July 2012 }}, Davit Chokoshvili, Master's Thesis, June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that [[social media]] websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, helped people organize the political revolutions in Egypt, by helping activists organize protests, communicate grievances, and disseminate information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/10youth.html |work=The New York Times |first=David D. |last=Kirkpatrick |title=Wired and Shrewd, Young Egyptians Guide Revolt |date=9 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129225903/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/10youth.html |archivedate=29 January 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have understood the Internet as an extension of the [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermasian]] notion of the ''[[public sphere]]'', observing how network communication technologies provide something like a global civic forum. However, incidents of politically motivated [[Internet censorship]] have now been recorded in many countries, including western democracies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== Philanthropy ===
The spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for [[Social peer-to-peer processes|peer-to-peer]] charities, which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals.  Websites, such as [[DonorsChoose]] and [[GlobalGiving]], allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice. A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of [[peer-to-peer lending]] for charitable purposes. [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]] pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary [[microfinance]] organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php ''Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210045011/http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |date=10 February 2010 }}, by David Roodman, Center for Global Development, 2 October 2009, as accessed  2 &amp; 16 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strom |first=Stephanie |title=Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes |work=The New York Times |page=6 |date=9 November 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129225155/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html |archivedate=29 January 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the recent spread of low-cost Internet access in [[developing countries]] has made genuine international person-to-person  philanthropy increasingly feasible. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] tapped into this trend to offer the first person-to-person microfinance platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without intermediaries. Members can fund loans for as little as a dollar, which the borrowers then use to develop business activities that improve their families' incomes while repaying loans to the members with interest. Borrowers access the Internet via public cybercafes, donated laptops in village schools, and even smart phones, then create their own profile pages through which they share photos and information about themselves and their businesses. As they repay their loans, borrowers continue to share updates and dialogue with lenders via their profile pages. This direct web-based connection allows members themselves to take on many of the communication and recording tasks traditionally performed by local organizations, bypassing geographic barriers and dramatically reducing the cost of microfinance services to the entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228000309/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia|title="Zidisha Set to "Expand" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance"|publisher=Microfinance Focus|date=7 February 2010|archivedate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security ==
{{Main|Internet security}}
Internet resources, hardware, and software components are the target of criminal or malicious attempts to gain unauthorized control to cause interruptions, commit fraud, engage in blackmail or access private information.

===Malware===
{{main|Malware}}
Malicious software used and spread on the Internet includes [[computer virus]]es which copy with the help of humans, [[computer worm]]s which copy themselves automatically, software for [[denial of service attack]]s, [[ransomware]], [[botnet]]s, and [[spyware]] that reports on the activity and typing of users. Usually, these activities constitute [[cybercrime]]. Defense theorists have also speculated about the possibilities of [[cyber warfare]] using similar methods on a large scale.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Surveillance ===

{{See also|Signals intelligence|Mass surveillance}}
The vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of [[data mining|data]] and [[traffic analysis|traffic]] on the Internet.&lt;ref name="sciam-internet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=internet-eavesdropping|title=Internet Eavesdropping: A Brave New World of Wiretapping |last=Diffie|first=Whitfield|author2=Susan Landau|date=August 2008|work=Scientific American|accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States for example, under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by Federal law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="eff-calea-archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025074518/http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/CALEA/?f=archive.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-10-25 |title=CALEA Archive – Electronic Frontier Foundation |work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website) |accessdate=2009-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eff-calea-summary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/issues/calea |title=CALEA: The Perils of Wiretapping the Internet |work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website) |accessdate=2009-03-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316041313/http://www.eff.org/issues/calea |archivedate=16 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eff-calea-faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/pages/calea-faq |title=CALEA: Frequently Asked Questions |work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (website) |accessdate=2009-03-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501072553/http://www.eff.org/pages/calea-faq |archivedate=1 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Packet capture]] is the monitoring of data traffic on a [[computer network]]. Computers communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called "packets", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete "message" again. [[Packet Capture Appliance]] intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs. A packet capture is an information ''gathering'' tool, but not an ''analysis'' tool. That is it gathers "messages" but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. Other programs are needed to perform [[traffic analysis]] and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information. Under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]] all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' [[broadband Internet]] and [[voice over Internet protocol]] (VoIP) traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baller.com/pdfs/ACE.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907032500/http://www.baller.com/pdfs/ACE.pdf|title=American Council on Education vs. FCC, Decision, United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|date=9 June 2006|accessdate=8 September 2013|archivedate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large amount of data gathered from packet capturing requires surveillance software that filters and reports relevant information, such as the use of certain words or phrases, the access of certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or chat with certain parties.&lt;ref name="usatoday-chatroom"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-10-11-chatroom-surv_x.htm|title=Government funds chat room surveillance research|last=Hill|first=Michael|date=11 October 2004|agency=Associated Press|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2009-03-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511220550/http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-10-11-chatroom-surv_x.htm|archivedate=11 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agencies, such as the [[Information Awareness Office]], [[NSA]], [[GCHQ]] and the [[FBI]], spend billions of dollars per year to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems for interception and analysis of data.&lt;ref name="zdnet-fbi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-151059.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407040227/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-151059.html|title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|date=30 January 2007|work=ZDNet News|accessdate=2009-03-13|archivedate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar systems are operated by [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran|Iranian secret police]] to identify and suppress dissidents.

Some governments, such as those of [[Burma]], [[Iran]], [[Censorship in North Korea|North Korea]], the [[Censorship in China|Mainland China]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] restrict access to content on the Internet within their territories, especially to political and religious content, with domain name and keyword filters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12187 ''Access Controlled: The Shaping of Power, Rights, and Rule in Cyberspace''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604102753/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12187 |date=4 June 2011 }}, Ronald J.

In Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, major Internet service providers have voluntarily agreed to restrict access to sites listed by authorities. While this list of forbidden resources is supposed to contain only known child pornography sites, the content of the list is secret.&lt;ref name="The Register"&gt;{{cite web|title=Finland censors anti-censorship site |work=[[The Register]] |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/18/finnish_policy_censor_activist/ |date=18 February 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220075300/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/18/finnish_policy_censor_activist/ |archivedate=20 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries, including the United States, have enacted laws against the possession or distribution of certain material, such as [[child pornography]], via the Internet, but do not mandate filter software. Many free or commercially available software programs, called [[content-control software]] are available to users to block offensive websites on individual computers or networks, in order to limit access by children to pornographic material or depiction of violence.

== Performance ==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
As the Internet is a heterogeneous network, the physical characteristics, including for example the [[Bit rate|data transfer rates]] of connections, vary widely. It exhibits [[Emergence|emergent phenomena]] that depend on its large-scale organization.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

=== Outages ===
An Internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signalling interruptions. Disruptions of [[submarine communications cable]]s may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the [[2008 submarine cable disruption]].  Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to a small number of high-capacity links.  Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access |title=Georgian woman cuts off web access to whole of Armenia |date=6 April 2011 |accessdate=11 April 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825075603/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access |archivedate=25 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of [[Internet censorship]], as in the blockage of the [[Internet in Egypt]], whereby approximately 93%&lt;ref name="renesys1"&gt;{{cite web| last =Cowie| first =James| title =Egypt Leaves the Internet| publisher =Renesys| url =http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml| accessdate =28 January 2011| archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/5w51j0pga?url=http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml| archivedate =28 January 2011| deadurl =no| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|anti-government protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12306041 |work=BBC News |title=Egypt severs internet connection amid growing unrest |date=28 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123164134/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12306041 |archivedate=23 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy use ===
In 2011, researchers estimated the energy used by the Internet to be between 170 and 307 GW, less than two percent of the energy used by humanity. This estimate included the energy needed to build, operate, and periodically replace the estimated 750 million laptops, a billion smart phones and 100 million servers worldwide as well as the energy that routers, cell towers, optical switches, Wi-Fi transmitters and cloud storage devices use when transmitting Internet traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2011/10/307-gw-the-maximum-energy-the.html "Internet responsible for 2 per cent of global energy usage"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001113334/http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2011/10/307-gw-the-maximum-energy-the.html |date=1 October 2014 }}, Jim Giles, ''New Scientist'' (Reed Business Information Ltd.), 26 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2011/papers/hotnetsX-final56.pdf "The Energy and Emergy of the Internet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810075940/http://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2011/papers/hotnetsX-final56.pdf |date=10 August 2014 }}, Barath Raghavan (ICSI) and Justin Ma (UC Berkeley), in ''Proceedings of the 10th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks'', 14–15 November 2011, Cambridge, MA, USA.

'''''Jerry's Girls''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] [[revue]] based on the songs of [[composer]]/[[Lyrics|lyric]]ist [[Jerry Herman]].

==Production history==
Created by Herman and Larry Alford in 1981, the show originated as a modest presentation at Onstage, a [[nightclub]] located in the [[Theater District]] in midtown-[[Manhattan]] (New York City). The revue consisted of four actresses and Herman. Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', John S. Wilson called it "a brilliantly lively and scintillating evening of [[cabaret]]."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, John S.[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/20/arts/cabaret-jerry-s-girls.html "'Jerry's Girls' review"]''New York Times'', August 20, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; 

After ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' opened to rave reviews two years later, producer [[Zev Buffman]] approached the pair and suggested they mount a full-scale, all-star version. On February 28, 1984, the expanded ''Jerry's Girls'' premiered at the Royal Poinciana Playhouse in [[Palm Beach, Florida]], with [[Carol Channing]], [[Andrea McArdle]], and [[Leslie Uggams]], backed by an all-female chorus, recreating scenes and songs from Herman's hits, including ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'', and ''[[Mack and Mabel]]''. ''Jerry's Girls'', the show's opening number set to the music of "It's Today" from ''Mame'', enumerated the many actresses who had appeared in Herman's shows over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_j/jerrys_girls.htm "'Jerry's Girls' listing] guidetomusicaltheatre.com, retrieved April 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The show then toured, playing at the [[Kennedy Center]]'s Eisenhower Theater for six weeks in June 1984. The revue went on to play engagements in 1984: in Kansas City, Missouri, Seattle, Vancouver, British Columbia, San Francisco,  Denver, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, David. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1984/06/11/channing/365d1c07-a911-42b1-b0df-2c0b7a72a30a/ "Channing"] ''The Washington Post'', June 11, 1984, accessed December 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, Louise. [http://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0808/080808.html " 'Jerry's Girls' Revue featuring the music and lyrics of Jerry Herman"] ''Christian Science Monitor'', August 8, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; An [[cast album|original cast recording]] was released by [[Polydor Records]].

The revue premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], directed by Alford and [[choreographed]] by [[Wayne Cilento]], on December 18, 1985 at the [[St. James Theatre]], where it ran for 141 performances and 14 previews. Uggams was joined by new cast members [[Dorothy Loudon]] and [[Chita Rivera]]. (Channing had other commitments and Chita Rivera was cast for her strong dancing.) A chorus of eight singers was added. Some reviewers praised the revue, with [[Clive Barnes]] writing "It can stay at the St. James Theatre forever, at the very least."&lt;ref&gt;Citron, Stephen. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lnPjiqOSHs0C&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=Rivera+%22Jerry's+Girls%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uHgCGkwQrt&amp;sig=_5yWAAjBWFYdtt7MlygdNGJsbdk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj72pb6sorRAhVGKiYKHWC6A1A4ChDoAQgvMAU "After 'La Gage'"]  ''Jerry Herman: Poet of the Showtune'', Yale University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0300100825}}, pp. 259-261&lt;/ref&gt;

In a critical review, [[Frank Rich]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote "The only thing that ''Jerry's Girls'' has in common with a bona fide Jerry Herman musical is that it occupies the St. James, the theater where Dolly once promised she'd never go away again... Whatever the point of the all-female cast, one must still wonder why the show's particular female stars were chosen. None of them have been associated with Mr. Herman's musicals. Only one (Miss Uggams) is primarily a singer. All three have strident mannerisms that the director, Larry Alford, takes sadistic glee in calling to our attention."&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Frank.[http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9D01E0DA153BF93AA25751C1A963948260 "Theater Review"]''New York Times'', December 19, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Chita Rivera received a nomination for the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical#1980|Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]].

An Australian production featuring [[Debra Byrne|Debbie Byrne]], [[Judi Connelli]], [[Marcia Hines]] and [[Jeanne Little]] played in Sydney and Melbourne in 1987. It was staged by Alford with set and costume design by [[Roger Kirk (designer)|Roger Kirk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/work/7899|title=AusStage - Jerry's Girls|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ausstage.edu.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revue was presented in London at the St. James Studio in March 2015, Produced by Katy Lipson for Aria Entertainment and Guy James, starring [[Anna-Jane Casey]], Ria Jones and Sarah-Louise Young, with direction by Kate Golledge and choreography by Matthew Cole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicaltheatrereview.com/jerrys-girls-london-revival-meet-girls/ " 'Jerry’s Girls' London revival – meet the Girls"] musicaltheatrereview.com, 5 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The revue transferred to the Off-West End [[Jermyn Street Theatre]] for a 3-week run in May 2015, with Emma Barton, Ria Jones and Sarah-Louise Young.&lt;ref&gt;Shenton, Mark.

The harmonies are strong and secure, and give real substance to Herman’s magnificent tunes."&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Stephen.

[[The Production Company]] presented the revue at the Playhouse, Arts Centre, Melbourne, Australia from 21 November to 6 December, 2015. This production included eleven leading actresses. The director Dean Bryant set the revue in a rehearsal hall.&lt;ref&gt;Mattarelli, Vito.

'''KidDesk''' is an alternative [[desktop environment|desktop]] software application. The early childhood learning company Hatch Early Childhood created KidDesk; it subsequently went to [[Edmark]], which was bought by [[IBM]] then sold to [[Riverdeep]] (now [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Learning Technology]]).

KidDesk is compatible with Microsoft Windows 95 and newer, as well as Apple System 7 and newer. KidDesk can be set to start when the computer starts up, and can only be exited through password entry. Adults choose what programs are included for the child to use, what icon represented the desk, and customize the software programs available for use.

==History==
Edmark first started shipping KidDesk in 1992. In 1993, Edmark updated KidDesk with KidDesk Family Edition for Macintosh and Windows 3.1, adding more desk accessories and desk styles. In 1995, KidDesk Family Edition was enhanced for Windows 95, and released one month after the new operating system shipped. In 1998, Edmark developed KidDesk Internet Safe. The Internet Safe edition was written for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Macintosh (including OS8). In 2008, HMH ported KidDesk Family Edition was to run on Windows Vista and in 2011 version 3.07 of KidDesk Family Edition was released as part of the 'Young Explorer' suite which is fully supported on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7.

==Features==
&lt;!--A typical KidDesk user's desk had e-mail as a blue mailbox, a telephone for the voice message system, and an image editor. An oval shaped plate for the user's name, and red cylinder with the writing utensils is the theme selector, the paper with Aug. 7 is the calendar, and the small icons and white text are the programs the user is allowed to use.

KidDesk contains the following features:--&gt;

*A picture editor incorporated into the desk. Used both in the Adult settings menu and in the desk itself. KidDesk users can edit their user logo with a pixel grid paint program.
*A calendar incorporated into the desk. This allows the user to set dates that the user finds important, and allows the date to be marked with a picture or text.
*A password exit feature. For security reasons, the adult can set a password so that KidDesk can only be exited if it is entered. As an extra security measure, the password exit function could only be accessed if the user pressed the ctrl + alt + A keyboard buttons simultaneously.
*A skin changer with several themes - farm, princess, sports, ocean, etc. These themes can be changed.
*The e-mail and voicemail features are customizable depending on the KidDesk installation.
*The ability to add websites that can be accessed on KidDesk, and the ability to block hyperlinks, JavaScript, data entry, etc., on said sites was an added for the 'Internet Safe' edition released in 1998.
*KidDesk Internet Safe edition is available in Spanish and Brazilian-Portuguese versions.

==Awards==
Since 1992, KidDesk has won 15 major awards.

"'''Mawtini'''" ({{lang-ar|'''موطني'''}}, {{Lang-en|"My Homeland"}}) is the national anthem of [[Iraq]], since 2004.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} The song was previously the ''de facto'' national anthem of [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] during the 1990s.

==History==
{{National anthems of Iraq}}
[[File:Former Iraqi national anthem (1958–1965, 2003–2004).wav|thumb|The old "Mawtini" used during the early 1960s and in 2003 and 2004]]
[[File:090623-A-6368A - Behind the Scenes While Recording Mawtini.webm|thumb|U.S. soldiers performing "Mawtini" in 2009]]
It is a popular poem written by the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] poet [[Ibrahim Tuqan]] c. 1934 and composed by the [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] composer [[Mohammed Flayfel]]. It served as [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]'s ''de facto'' national anthem since it was written and until 1996 when it was officially replaced by "[[Fida'i]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wills|first1=Emily Regan|title=Discourses and Differences: Situating Pro-Palestine Activism in Discursive Context|journal=Theory in Action|date=July 2016|volume=9|issue=3|pages=48-71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, it was re-adopted as Iraq's national anthem, on the order of [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] chief [[Paul Bremer]]&lt;ref name=Star&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq aims to unite with new national anthem, flag |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2012/Sep-24/189006-iraq-aims-to-unite-with-new-national-anthem-flag.ashx#ixzz27Khy2Axp|accessdate=1 October 2012|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the national anthem of [[Iraq]]. It replaced the old anthem "[[Ardulfurataini (national anthem)|Ardh Alforatain]]", which was in use from 1981 to 2003 and associated with [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Ba'athist regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nationalanthems.me/iraq-mawtini | title=Iraq - Mawtini | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=2011-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===

After Iraq's Ba'athist regime was deposed in 2003, the old "Mawtini" formerly used as the Iraqi national anthem during the late 1950s and early 1960s was brought back and used temporarily as an interim national anthem&lt;ref name=Anthem/&gt; until it was replaced by the current "Mawtini" in 2004.

The '''outlaw biker film''' is a [[film genre]] that portrays its characters as motorcycle riding rebels.  The characters are usually members of an [[outlaw motorcycle club]].

==History==
Outlaw biker clubs formed in the late 1940s on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] after the end of World War II.  Their culture was first popularized in the [[Marlon Brando]] film ''[[The Wild One]]'' (1953), which tells a story based very loosely on actual events. The film's success was followed by a string of low-budget [[exploitation film]]s aimed at a teenage audience such as ''[[Motorcycle Gang (film)|Motorcycle Gang]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Hot Angel]]'' (1958). But the genre really took off in the mid-1960s, after the [[Hell's Angels]] motorcycle club became prominent in the media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/film/journal/articles/outlaw-biker-movie.htm |title=Ripped from Today's Headlines: The Outlaw Biker Movie Cycle |accessdate=2008-01-26 |last=Syder |first=Andrew |publisher=Scope |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060830230257/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/film/journal/articles/outlaw-biker-movie.htm |archivedate = 2006-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular, after [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s book ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs]]'' (1966) was  published.

In 1965, director [[Russ Meyer]] made ''[[Motorpsycho (film)|Motorpsycho]]'' (aka ''Motor Psycho''), an obscure film about an evil motorcycle gang led by a disturbed Vietnam War veteran. In 1966, [[American International Pictures]] (AIP) released ''[[The Wild Angels]]'' with [[Peter Fonda]], [[Bruce Dern]], and [[Nancy Sinatra]].  This film, aimed at the teenage drive-in crowd, was a surprise hit and a new [[exploitation film]] subgenre was born.  AIP dominated the market and quickly released a semi-sequel ''[[Devil's Angels]]'' starring actor-director [[John Cassavetes]] and ''[[The Glory Stompers]]'' with [[Dennis Hopper]] in 1967.

In 1968, AIP produced ''[[The Mini-Skirt Mob]]'', ''[[Angels from Hell]]'', and ''[[The Savage Seven]]'' (the film debut of actress/director [[Penny Marshall]]). The company made five more biker gang films: ''[[Hell's Belles (film)|Hell's Belles]]'' (1969), ''[[Hell's Angels '69]]'' (1969), ''[[Angel Unchained]]'' (1970), ''[[The Hard Ride]]'' (1971), and ''[[Chrome and Hot Leather]]'' (1971).

AIP and Fanfare Films also co-produced ''[[The Born Losers]]'' (1967). Fanfare made ''[[Hells Angels on Wheels]]'' (1967) with [[Jack Nicholson]], ''[[Run, Angel, Run!]]'' (1969), ''Wild Wheels'' (1969), and ''[[Nam's Angels]]'' (1970).

Other small independent filmmakers went on to produce dozens of low-budget biker films until the trend dissipated in the early '70s. Crown International produced and/or distributed ''[[Wild Rebels]]'' (1967), ''[[The Hellcats]]'' (1968), ''[[The Sidehackers]]'' (1969), ''Wild Riders'' (1971), and ''Pink Angels'' (1972). Independent-International Pictures Corp. produced three films in this genre directed by [[Al Adamson]] – ''[[Satan's Sadists]]'' (1969), ''Hell's Bloody Devils'' (1970), and ''[[Angels' Wild Women]]'' (1972).

''[[The Rebel Rousers]]'' (filmed 1967, released 1970) featured Jack Nicholson, [[Bruce Dern]], and [[Harry Dean Stanton]]. Dern also starred as a sadistic gang leader in ''The Cycle Savages'' (1970).  In 1969, Peter Fonda, Hopper, and Nicholson teamed up on the classic "hippie biker" movie, ''[[Easy Rider]]'', the antithesis of the violent biker-gang genre.

[[Sonny Barger]], founder of the Oakland chapter of the Hell's Angels, was a consultant on several films.  He and other gang members appeared as extras in ''Hells Angels on Wheels'' and ''Hell's Angels '69''. The Hell's Angels appeared as extras playing a gang called the Las Vegas Hotdoggers in the [[Roger Corman]] film ''[[Naked Angels]]'' (1969) starring [[Michael Greene (actor)|Michael Greene]].

===''The Born Losers''===
''[[The Born Losers]]'' (1967) introduced [[Tom Laughlin]]'s character Billy Jack. Unable to get his ''[[Billy Jack]]'' script produced, Laughlin wrote and directed ''The Born Losers'' to capitalize on the current biker movie trend (which finally allowed him to make ''Billy Jack'' in 1971). The story was inspired by news reports of the Hell's Angels terrorizing a California community. As a cost-saving measure, a stunt scene of a motorcycle crashing into a pond was taken from co-producer AIP's comedy ''[[The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini]]'' (1966).

''The Born Losers'' is also significant for its social criticism and portrayal of the biker gang as a force of pure, unredeemable evil. Here, for the first time, a lone hero stands up to, and ultimately defeats, the gang. Prior to this, the majority of the films in this genre imitated ''The Wild One'' with a sympathetic gang member (the reluctant leader or a new member) who ultimately rejects the outlaw biker lifestyle. Prime examples are the Fonda character in ''The Wild Angels'', Jack Nicholson in ''Hell's Angels on Wheels'' (1967), and [[Joe Namath]] in ''[[C.C. and Company]]'' (1970).

[[Jack Starrett]] has the role of a tough-talking police officer. He played essentially the same character in ''Hells Angels on Wheels'' and ''Angels from Hell'' (1968). Starrett was also in ''Hell's Bloody Devils'' (1970), and directed ''[[Run, Angel, Run]]'' (1969) . In ''[[Nam's Angels]]'' (1970) the bikers are portrayed as patriotic heroes sent on a rescue mission to Vietnam.

===Novelty biker films===
A number of novelty films were made featuring all-female biker gangs such as ''[[The Hellcats]]'' aka ''Biker Babes'' (1967), ''[[She-Devils on Wheels]]'' (1968), ''[[The Mini-Skirt Mob]]'' (from AIP) with [[Sherry Jackson]] and [[Harry Dean Stanton]] (1968), ''Sisters in Leather'' (1969) with [[Pat Barrington]], ''[[Angels' Wild Women]]'' (1972), ''Cycle Vixens'' (1978), and ''Chrome Angels'' (2009).

''The Pink Angels'' (1971) is a somewhat campy film about a gang of homosexual bikers who head down the coast to attend a drag ball. ''[[Bury Me an Angel]]'' (1972) is a revenge story featuring a female biker (and female director). ''[[Angels' Wild Women]]'' (1972) centers around a group of tough female bikers who dominate men and eventually go a revenge-driven rampage. The story (and original ''Screaming Angels'' title) was changed after the producers found theaters were no longer interested in traditional biker films. Inspired by the popularity of [[Roger Corman]]'s ''[[The Big Doll House]]'' (1971), a violent [[women in prison film]] with [[Pam Grier]], new scenes were added featuring aggressive female bikers and a Pam Grier lookalike was added to the cast. The reworked and retitled film was a box office success.

In [[Japan]], female biker films became popular starting with ''[[Alleycat Rock: Female Boss]]'' (a.k.a. ''Stray Cat Rock: Delinquent Girl Boss'' or  ''Female Juvenile Delinquent Leader: Alleycat Rock'' or ''Wildcat Rock'') (1970). This trend was part of the ''[[sukeban]]'' (delinquent girl) subgenre of [[Toei Company|Toei]]'s "Pinky violence" style of ''[[Pink film]]''. The series continued with ''[[Stray Cat Rock: Wild Jumbo]]'', ''[[Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter]]'', ''[[Stray Cat Rock: Machine Animal]]'' and ''Alleycat Rock: Crazy Riders '71''. Another similar series of exploitation films with female bikers includes ''[[Delinquent Girl Boss: Ballad of the Yokohama Hoods]]'' (1971), ''[[Girl Boss: Queen Bee Strikes Again]]'' (a.k.a. ''Girl Boss Blues: Queen Bee’s Counterattack'') (1971), and ''[[Girl Boss Guerilla]]'' (1972).

===The 1970s to the present===
In 1970, [[Roger Corman]] left AIP to form [[New World Pictures]] which released ''[[Angels Die Hard]]'' (1970), ''[[Angels Hard as They Come]]'' (1971), and ''[[Bury Me an Angel]]'' (1971).

As the trend began to lose momentum, filmmakers started to create horror hybrids such as ''[[Werewolves on Wheels]]'' (1971) and ''[[Blood Freak]]'' (1972). The British horror film ''[[Psychomania]]'' (1971) involves a biker gang that makes a pact with the devil to obtain immortality.

Black motorcycle gangs appeared in a few [[blaxploitation]] films such as ''The Black Angels'' (1970) and ''[[The Black Six]]'' (1974).

The biker gang ethos also featured strongly in the famed low budget Australian production ''[[Mad Max]]'' (1979, dir. George Miller, starring Mel Gibson), with the film spawning the real-life subculture of [[survival bike]]s.

By the late 1980s, the once shocking and controversial genre became an object of campy humor in horror-comedies such as ''[[Chopper Chicks in Zombietown]]'' (1989), ''[[I Bought a Vampire Motorcycle]]'' (1990), and ''Biker Zombies'' (2001).

''[[Beyond the Law (1992 film)|Beyond the Law]]'' (1992) is based on a true story and centers on Dan Saxon ([[Charlie Sheen]]), an undercover cop who infiltrates a group of criminal outlaw bikers. [[Larry Ferguson]] wrote the screenplay after reading the article "Undercover Angel" by [[Lawrence Linderman]] in the July, 1981 issue of Playboy on an undercover agent named Dan Black.

2003 film ''[[Biker Boyz]]'', starring [[Laurence Fishburne]] and [[Djimon Hounsou]], depicts illegal bike racing gangs, although neither are criminals.

2004 film ''[[Torque (film)|Torque]]'', which features [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]], [[Martin Henderson]] and [[Ice Cube]], is about a biker who is faced by a rival gang leader for taking his bikes (which carry drugs), and is then framed for the murder of a member of a third gang.

[[Quentin Tarantino]] served as executive producer on ''[[Hell Ride]]'' (2008) starring Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen. This is an homage to the motorcycle gang films of the past. It was written and directed by [[Larry Bishop]], who acted in a number of biker films such as ''[[The Savage Seven]]'' (1968). Tarantino is a noted fan of the [[Australia]]n biker movie, [[Stone (1974 film)|Stone]] (1974).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.takethetripagain.com/release003.html&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' (2008-2014) is an American [[television drama series]] about a California motorcycle club. The series premiered on September 3, 2008, on [[cable network]] [[FX (TV channel)|FX]].

The documentary ''Biker Mania'' (2009) includes a compilation of theater trailers and footage that tracks the history of the genre from the 1950s to the present.

[[Edward Winterhalder]] is the subject of a feature-length documentary movie about the outlaw biker lifestyle that is being filmed in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aimag.com/shovelhead-road-author-edward-winterhalder-shooting-outlaw-bikers-documentary/|title=Shovelhead Road: Author Edward Winterhalder Shooting Outlaw Bikers Documentary|publisher=aimag.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9903">'''Paranoid fiction''' is a term sometimes used to describe works of [[literature]] that explore the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] nature of reality and how it can be manipulated by forces in power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/new_literary_history/v028/28.1flieger.html Postmodern Perspective: The Paranoid Eye. ''New Literary History''.Volume 28, Number 1, Winter 1997, pp. 87-109]&lt;/ref&gt;  These forces can be external, such as a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] government, or they can be internal, such as a character's [[mental illness]] or refusal to accept the harshness of the world he or she is in.

Unlike [[speculative fiction]], paranoid fiction is written in a way so as to imply that the story may only be a [[delusion]] of the characters, instead of treating it as an [[alternate history]] or an [[fictional universe|in-fiction universe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==History==
The elements of paranoid fiction can be seen in works dating as far back as the late 19th and early 20th century. Some of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novels contained paranoid and psychologically troubled characters set against the dark backdrop of a modernizing [[Russia]]. [[Franz Kafka]], in particular, was known for his exaggerated accounts of what he portrayed as real life in his works, to enhance the absurdity of the life themes they conveyed.  Similarly, [[George Orwell]]'s works, while not as exaggerated, confirmed the practice of using [[dystopia]]n fiction to take a different outlook on highly common themes, including identity and personal desires.

The term ''paranoid fiction'' was first coined to label sensationalistic and off-beat stories as bizarre and thus outside the realm of literary fiction.  Starting after [[World War I]], however, [[modernism|modernists]] began exploring the stranger themes of life in art, in response to the themes of death being effectively mechanized and made impossible to toy with by the war's graphic depictions.  As a result, modernist literature tended to explore the meaning and construction of reality, shifting away from the progressive, cause-and-effect structure of [[Literary realism|realist]] fiction towards a more complex and disjointed depiction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Lye, John (1997). [http://www.brocku.ca/english/courses/2F55/modernism.html "Some Attributes of Modernist Literature."]&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], [[absurdism|absurdists]] carried this focus one step further by placing these common themes in surreal and fantastic settings, turning what would have been otherwise mundane concepts into distinctive, stand-out ones, thus converting the paranoid fiction genre into a legitimate one.

[[Philip K. Dick]] is most frequently viewed as the forefather of the modern paranoid fiction.  His works were born out of paranoia and hallucination; he had sudden visions of places he'd never been to and events he'd never witnessed, possibly from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] or an overly active imagination.  These visions were so vivid that Dick put them down on paper, never failing to classify them as only "speculative thought," and thus outside the boundary of conventional thought.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Erik. [http://www.techgnosis.com/pkdnet.html "Philip K. Dick's Divine Interference."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205050412/http://techgnosis.com/pkdnet.html |date=2006-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Dick's works start out uneventfully in a seemingly ordinary setting, then transpose to a [[surrealism|surrealistic]] [[fantasy]], with the characters discovering that what they thought real was in fact a delusion.  Throughout his works, Dick maintained a balance between the expected traits of the [[science fiction]] genre they were also categorized in, and the eccentric and disturbing elements coming from his mind.&lt;ref name="paranoid"&gt;[http://www.strangewords.com/archive/paranoia.html "Strange Words: Paranoid."]&lt;/ref&gt;  A recurring theme in his works is on how reality is perceived and treated differently by people depending on their mindsets.

==Characteristics==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:BladeRunner Sun.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Blade Runner]]: Dr Tyrell polarizing his office window to control the sun implies the god-like powers of the Tyrell Corporation.]] --&gt;
At its most basic, paranoid fiction refers specifically to works about speculations and possible conspiracies by people in power, told by an [[unreliable narrator]].&lt;ref name="paranoid"/&gt;  However, the most popular type of paranoid fiction has proved to be one in which the universe appears on the surface to be definite and real, but upon closer inspection, to actually be deceptive and deliberately misleading.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  In these works, there are either questions raised as to the realness of the world the characters are living in, or a distinction made between a fantasy world and its reality.

Paranoid fiction often overlaps with many other genres, most commonly [[dystopia]]n fiction, [[science fiction]], and [[film noir]], sharing many of its main themes and literary devices.  Generally, however, paranoid fiction avoids explicitly defined themes and concrete [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s in favor of [[allegory|allegories]] and ambiguous [[symbol]]ism to emphasize the dreamlike and unreal nature of the characters' world.&lt;ref name="sanmasonic"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027080230/http://geocities.com/sanmasonic/Paranoid/ "Paranoid Fiction."]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a purely dystopian work typically explores the mechanisms and motives of the totalitarian state to keep its people under control, whereas one of paranoid fiction would concentrate more on the effects of the state on its inhabitants' mental and [[emotional well-being]], and its implications on the decadent condition of society.  George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' can be viewed as a balance of the two, depicting the Party as crushing free will through a strictly defined [[Newspeak|language]] and constant monitoring, but also through psychological torture and the distorting of people's viewpoints on what is true and what is false.

To further increase their "[[magic realism]]," works of paranoid fiction often employ common devices and archetypes from other genres, including a detective-solving structure, plot twists, or philosophical themes, to create a [[surrealism|surrealistic]] tone and an atmosphere of fear and dread.  Plots also tend to be fanciful and occasionally futuristic to emphasize their inherent absurdity and imaginativeness, but also maintain some measure of realism to comment on how apparently unrealistic stories can, in fact, be (often frighteningly) closer to real life than one might think at first glance.&lt;ref name="sanmasonic"/&gt;

Sometimes paranoid fiction will strongly imply, and occasionally admit outright, that its constructed world is a lie or an illusion.  In this case, the plot will center on the main character's struggle between the physical and spiritual; i.e. the actual world they are in, versus the world they want to see and believe in. Here, the cause of the fantasy is the protagonist's internal desires, doubts, and suspicions.  Such works tend to be more introspective and focused on the individual, than on a community or a regime.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

'''''Pink Panther and Pals''''' is an American [[animated series|animated television series]] and is a modern adaptation of the classic [[DePatie–Freleng Enterprises|DePatie-Freleng]] [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] shorts from the 1960s. The program was produced for [[Cartoon Network]] by Desert Panther Production and [[Rubicon Group Holding|Rubicon Studios]] in association with [[Mirisch Company|Mirisch-Geoffrey]]-[[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises|DePatie-Freleng]] and [[MGM Television]], and premiered on the channel on March 7, 2010, both in [[High-definition television|HD]] and [[Standard-definition television|SD]]. [[KidsClick]] picked up this show on July 1st, 2017, and debuted it in both HD and SD as well.&lt;ref name=cartoon&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blog.bcdb.com/pink-turns-50-celebrate/|title=Pink Turns 50! Let’s Celebrate!|author=Koch, Dave|publisher=Big Cartoon News|date=April 14, 2014|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the classic cartoon show, the programme is composed of two seven-minute ''Pink Panther'' shorts and a seven-minute ''Ant and the Aardvark'' short in between, retaining the main characters in both shorts though with some changes. 

==Show premise==

===The Pink Panther===
''The [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]]'' shorts are reminiscent of the classic [[DePatie-Freleng]] shorts from the 1960s and the 1970s, from art direction, silent acting, musical scoring, and story lines. The Pink Panther remains silent throughout the show, and has been aged down as a teenager.  [[The Little Man (The Pink Panther)|The Little Man]] has been renamed to "Big Nose" for this series with vocal effects provided by [[Alex Nussbaum]]. Pink Panther's [[donkey]] and Big Nose's lovable [[Dog|canine]] companion have been reintroduced as well.

===The Ant and the Aardvark===
''[[The Ant and the Aardvark]]'' is based on the classic [[DePatie-Freleng]] shorts. In this version, the Aardvark's (Eddie Garvar, in the style of [[John Byner]], imitating [[Jackie Mason]]) Jewish sense of humor from his classic counterpart has retained, the Ant (now voiced by [[Kel Mitchell]] famous for his roles on the classic [[Nickelodeon]] series' ''[[All That]]'', ''[[Kenan and Kel]]'', the movie ''[[Good Burger]]'', and the [[PBS Kids|PBS]] series, ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'') has been aged down like the teenage Pink Panther; however, he is never called "Charlie" (as his classic counterpart). The series now takes place in a jungle and new characters are introduced in this series.

==Characters==
{{Tone|section|date=September 2011}}
*The Pink Panther: The protagonist of the series. He's a cool and collected character who always seems to rub Big Nose the wrong way. As in the classic series, he is, for the most part, a silent protagonist. He is also nicknamed Pink or Pinky.
*Big Nose: Based on the original "Little Man" from the classic series. He is the neighbor of the Pink Panther and is not fond of him at all. He always ends up being upstaged by the Pink Panther in everything he tries to do where he got the Pink Panther back instead. He's depicted as short, with a big nose and a mustache, and is plain white in color. He has a pet dog that, unlike his master, has almost no problem with the Pink Panther at all.
*Hoarse: The Pink Panther's donkey, based on a horse that gave him trouble in several cartoons of the classic series.
*Dog: Big Nose's dog who is cute and lovable. Like his master, he is a plain white color and not very outstanding. He is not always fond of the Pink Panther, and is not afraid of showing his displeasure. But from time to time has shown to enjoy the Pink Panther's activities such as music and dancing.
*Ant: A small red ant, and one of the title characters of "''The Ant and the Aardvark''" sketches. He is quite sharp and intelligent, and like real-life ants, is physically very strong, being able to carry objects many times his weight.
*Aardvark: A blue [[aardvark]], and the main antagonist in "''The Ant and the Aardvark''" sketches. Like real aardvarks, he wants to eat the Ant. He's sly, sneaky and uses the [[fourth wall]]; he frequently addresses the audience of what's going on.
*Eli: An [[elephant]], is responsible for protecting the Ant from the Aardvark.

[[File:Tyrone power alice faye ragtime6.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Tyrone Power]] passionately, lovingly, embraces [[Alice Faye]] in the [[1938 in film|1938 film]] ''[[Alexander's Ragtime Band (film)|Alexander's Ragtime Band]]''.]]
'''Romance films''' or '''romance movies''' are romantic love stories recorded in visual media for broadcast in theaters and on [[television|TV]] that focus on [[passion (emotion)|passion]], [[emotion]], and the affectionate romantic involvement of the main characters and the journey that their genuinely strong, true and pure romantic love takes them through dating, courtship or [[marriage]]. Romance films make the romantic love story or the search for strong and pure love and romance the main plot focus. Occasionally, romance lovers face obstacles such as [[finance]]s, physical [[illness]], various forms of [[discrimination]], psychological restraints or family that threaten to break their union of love. As in all quite strong, deep, and close romantic relationships, tensions of day-to-day life, [[temptation]]s (of [[infidelity]]), and differences in compatibility enter into the plots of romantic films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/romancefilms.html |title=Romance films |website=[[Filmsite.org]] |access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romantic films often explore the essential themes of [[love at first sight]], young with older love, unrequited romantic love, obsessive love, sentimental love, [[Spirituality|spiritual love]], forbidden love/romance, platonic love, sexual and passionate love, sacrificial love, explosive and destructive love, and [[Tragedy|tragic love]]. Romantic films serve as great escapes and fantasies for viewers, especially if the two people finally overcome their difficulties, declare their love, and experience life "happily ever after", implied by a reunion and final kiss. In romantic television series, the development of such romantic relationships may play out over many episodes, and different characters may become intertwined in different romantic arcs.

==Subgenres==
* '''[[Historical romance]]''' – A romantic story with a period setting. This includes films such as ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' and ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]''.
* {{anchor|Romantic drama}}'''Romantic dramas''' usually revolve around an obstacle which prevents deep and true romantic love between two people. Music is often employed to indicate the emotional mood, creating an atmosphere of greater insulation for the couple. The conclusion of a romantic drama typically does not indicate whether a final romantic union between the two main characters will occur. Some examples of romantic drama films are ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', ''[[The Bridges of Madison County (film)|The Bridges of Madison County]]'', ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'', ''[[Sommersby]]'', ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', ''[[Coming Home (1978 film)|Coming Home]]'', ''[[Jungle Fever]]'', ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'', ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'', ''[[Water for Elephants (film)|Water for Elephants]]'', ''[[5 Centimeters per Second]]'', ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'', and ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1=Wheeler W. | last1=Dixon | year=2000 | title=Film genre 2000: new critical essays | series=The SUNY series, cultural studies in cinema/video | page=238 | publisher=SUNY Press | isbn=0-7914-4514-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dgzACTHIAcsC&amp;pg=PA238}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Chick flick]]''' is a term often associated with romance films as many are targeted to a female audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Simpson |editor-first=John |title=Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, on CD-ROM Version 4.0 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-956383-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-last=Stevenson |editor1-first=Angus |editor2-last= Lindberg |editor2-first=Christine A. |year=2010 |title=New Oxford American Dictionary, Third Edition |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=300 |isbn=978-0-19-539288-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many romance films may be targeted at women, this is not a defining characteristic of a romance film and a ''chick flick'' does not necessarily have a romance as a central theme, revolve around the romantic involvement of characters or even contain a romantic relationship. As such, the terms cannot be used interchangeably. Films of this genre include ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', ''[[The Notebook (2004 film)|The Notebook]]'', ''[[Dear John (2010 film)|Dear John]]'', ''[[A Walk to Remember]]'', and ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]''.
* '''[[Romantic comedy|Romantic comedies]]''' are films with light-hearted, humorous plotlines, centered on romantic ideals such as that true love is able to surmount most obstacles. Humour in such films tends to be of a verbal, low-key variety or situational, as opposed to slapstick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/subgenre/romantic-comedy-d529 |title=Romantic Comedy |publisher=[[AllRovi]] |access-date=10 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811071237/http://www.allrovi.com/movies/subgenre/romantic-comedy-d529 |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Films within this genre include ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', ''[[Love Actually]]'', ''[[Moonstruck]]'', ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'', ''[[Something's Gotta Give (film)|Something's Gotta Give]]'', ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'', ''[[Annie Hall]]'', and ''[[The Apartment]]''.

'''Six Flags Dubai''' is a theme park being built in [[United Arab Emirates]] by Meraas Leisure and Entertainment under a licensing agreement with [[Six Flags]]. The park was scheduled to open in November 2011, but Six Flags terminated the agreement in 2010 after [[Tatweer]] failed to make a payment owed to Six Flags.&lt;ref name="Terminated"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9ODcwMDN8Q2hpbGRJRD0tMXxUeXBlPTM=&amp;t=1|title=Six Flags 2010 Annual Report|page=8|accessdate=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revived and is scheduled to open in 2019 near Lapita Hotel and Riverland Dubai at [[Dubai Parks and Resorts]].

==History==
In March 2008, [[Dubai Holding|Dubai Holdings, Inc.]] and Six Flags announced a corporate marketing alliance that would allow Tatweer, a member of Dubai Holdings, Inc., to lease the exclusive right to the Six Flags brand name in the [[Dubailand]] Development of the [[United Arab Emirates]]. According to Six Flags, this was to be the largest Six Flags to be developed outside of the United States, and the first of several products outside of the Middle East. The park was to feature thrill rides and live entertainment featuring [[Tony Hawk]]. Groundbreaking was set to begin in early 2009. Unlike other Six Flags theme parks (including [[Six Flags America]]), this one was not going to have a [[Looney Tunes]] theme in its park or any other [[Warner Bros.]] characters because Warner Bros. was planning on opening its own theme park in Yas Island, Abu Dhabi and the new theme park would use other characters and properties for themes, rides, and attractions. Six Flags Dubailand was going to be the first park to be built and opened as a Six Flags since Six Flags Over Mid-America (now [[Six Flags St. Louis]]) opened in 1971.

In 2010, owing to financial difficulties, Tatweer failed to make a payment due to Six Flags under the license agreement, breaching their contract, and Six Flags terminated the agreement.&lt;ref name="Terminated"/&gt;

On April 10, 2014, Six Flags announced a new, separate partnership with Meraas Leisure and Entertainment to build a Six Flags-branded theme park in Jebel Ali with a scheduled launch date in late 2017.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investors.sixflags.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=61629&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1917796|title=Six Flags-Branded Theme Park to Open in Dubai|accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2016, it was reported that the Six Flags Dubai theme park will be in the second phase of Dubai Parks and Resorts and is expected to open in the third-quarter of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dubai Parks &amp; Resorts presses ahead with Six Flags theme park|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/travel-tourism/dubai-parks--resorts-presses-ahead-with-six-flags-theme-park|website=The National|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2016, before the opening of Dubai Parks and Resorts in October, construction began on Six Flags Dubai and is expected to have 27 rides and attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dubai Parks and Resorts: Construction of Six Flags theme park takes off|url=http://www.emirates247.com/business/economy-finance/dubai-parks-and-resorts-construction-of-six-flags-theme-park-takes-off-2016-07-03-1.634782|website=Emirates 24{{!}}7|date=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 2018, it was announced that the future of the Six Flags Dubai project was "uncertain", following losses at both Six Flags and DXB Entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Six Flags' Future in Dubai Is Now Uncertain|url=https://skift.com/2018/10/24/six-flags-future-in-dubai-is-now-uncertain/|website=Skift|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3661">[[File:Shimer College Sox Hop 1948.jpg|thumb|Sock hop at [[Shimer College]] in 1948.]]
A '''sock hop''' or '''sox hop''', often also called a '''record hop'''{{sfn|McBride|2014|p=199}} or just a '''hop''', was an informal sponsored dance event for teenagers in mid-20th-century North America, featuring [[popular music]].  

== History ==
Sock hops were held as early as 1944 by the American Junior Red Cross to raise funds during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=Evening Star|location=Washington, DC|title=Juniors to Hold Important Jobs in War Fund Drive|page=37|date=1944-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then became a fad among American teenagers in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Life|title=Teen-Agers|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|date=1948-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sock hops were commonly held at [[high school]]s and other educational institutions, often in the school [[gym]] or [[cafeteria]]. The term came about because dancers were required to remove their hard-soled shoes to protect the varnished floor of the gymnasium.{{sfn|McBride|2014|pp=200}} The music at a sock hop was usually played from vinyl records, sometimes presented by a [[disc jockey]].{{sfn|McBride|2014|pp=200}} Occasionally there were also live bands. 

In later years, "hops" became strongly associated with the 1950s and early [[rock and roll]].{{sfn|McBride|2014|pp=200}} [[Danny and the Juniors]] sang "[[At the Hop]]" in 1957, which named many popular dances and otherwise documented what happened at a hop.{{sfn|McBride|2014|pp=199-200}} In subsequent decades, with the widespread popularity of [[Sneakers (footwear)|sneakers]] and other types of indoors-only shoes, the practice of removing shoes was dropped.  The term then came to be applied more generally to any informal dance for [[teenager]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mAdUqLrKw4YC|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|page=1811|first=Eric|last=Partridge|title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|isbn=9780415259385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steve Paul''' (born Stephen Neal Paul on April 28, 1941, Bronx, New York; died October 21, 2012, New York City) was the American one-time manager of [[Johnny Winter]], among other related performers, as well as being the owner of [[The Scene (performance venue)|The Scene]], a popular [[New York City]] club in the 1960s and 1970, and the founder of [[Blue Sky Records]].

==History==
Paul's initial reputation was as the owner of 'Steve Paul's The Scene', a popular New York City club in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1968, he became the manager of Johnny Winter.  Paul had travelled from New York to Texas to successfully promote his managerial abilities to Winter, after reading a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' review of Texas music by [[Larry Sepulvado]], in which Winter was described as "the hottest item outside of [[Janis Joplin]]".&lt;ref name = gibsonart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/40-years-of-johnny-winter-422/ |title=40 Years of Johnny Winter |publisher=Gibson.com |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on Paul's negotiating abilities, Winter shortly thereafter in 1968 signed the then-largest recording contract ever offered by [[Columbia Records]]:  $600,000, payable over five years.&lt;ref name = gibsonart/&gt;

Winter performed regularly at Steve Paul's New York club, The Scene, where various artists, such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Jim Morrison]] and [[Janis Joplin]], would make guest appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.classicbands.com/JohnnyWinterInterview.html |title=Interview With Johnny Winter |publisher=Classicbands.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these performances were of historic significance, such as the performance by Jimi Hendrix, [[Buddy Miles]] and Johnny Winter in February 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theselvedgeyard.wordpress.com/2010/04/13/winter-whites-johnny-edgar-legendary-winter-brothers/ Performance image and caption].  Winter Whites|Johnny and Edgar: Legendary Winter Brothers. Retrieved 2011-02-05&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the place where on March 18, 1968 Jimi Hendrix and a very intoxicated Jim Morrison accompanied by Buddy Miles were recorded together live, on Hendrix's own recording device, a recording which has become notoriously sought after by fans and collectors alike. 

Johnny Winter appeared at [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock Music Festival]], but his performance was not included in the film or initial soundtrack recordings, due to unresolved contractual issues between Steve Paul and the festival organizers, prior to Winter's performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vinylrecords.ch/winter/Timeline/winter_timeline_1969.html The Johnny Winter Story]; Johnny Winter Timeline 1969; The Johnny Winter Story.  Retrieved 2011-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Paul was Winter's manager for fifteen years.&lt;ref name = Sullivan&gt;Mary Lou Sullivan, [http://www.johnnywinterbook.com/--_managers Description of Steve Paul].  ''Raisin' Cain: The Wild and Raucous Story of Johnny Winter''; book publication website. Retrieved 2011-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1970, Paul, who also managed [[The McCoys]], brought the artists together,&lt;ref name = gibsonart/&gt; resulting in Winter's successful ''[[Johnny Winter And]]'' (1970), including the hit "[[Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo]]".  The McCoys had first met Winter during their term as the resident house band at The Scene, commencing in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/the-mccoys-rock-group Profile of The McCoys].  [[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] Musician Profiles, as reprinted at www.answers.com.  Retrieved 2011-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Paul started [[Blue Sky Records]], a label promoted and distributed by [[Columbia Records]].  Between 1973 and 1982, it became the principal recording label for [[Johnny Winter]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rick Derringer]] and [[David Johansen]], all of whom were managed by Paul.  Through Johnny Winter's involvement as a producer, the label is also credited with reviving the later career of [[Muddy Waters]].  The label largely ceased operations with Winter's departure in 1983, which coincided with the termination of his management relationship with Steve Paul.

In later years, Paul developed Downtown TV, an online entertainment network.&lt;ref name = Sullivan/&gt;

'''''Top Talent''''' (탑 탤런트) is a [[talent show]] competition for English speaking performers in [[South Korea]].  The competition features singers, dancers, magicians, comedians, rappers, beat-boxers and other performers age 12 and up competing for a cash prize and the opportunity to appear on stage at a festival and venues around Korea.  The first competition was held over the course of three days in June and July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Kerry, Paul. [http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130521000570 "International panel seeks ‘Top Talent’"] ''[[The Korea Herald]]'', Seoul, 21 May 2013. Retrieved on 10 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among its significant features, '''''Top Talent''''' was the first talent competition in South Korea to provide amateur and professional English speaking performers with the opportunity to perform in a large scale talent search process with the winner ultimately being decided by an audience vote in the show's finale.  The show incorporates many of the characteristics seen in popular [[reality television]] talent competitions such as [[America's Got Talent]] and [[The X Factor (U.S. TV series)|The X-Factor]].

The show was created by C.J. Allen and will be produced as a web-series by Seconds2Impact Media set for release in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Word from the ROK.

== Selection Process ==

=== Auditions ===

Acts audition in front of a panel of four judges and a live audience.  Acts have 90 seconds to perform before being voted upon by the judges.  If the act receives three votes or a unanimous vote from the judges, they move on to the call-back round.

=== Call-Backs ===

During the Call-Back round, acts must perform a new routine or song that they did not perform for their audition.  After all of the acts have performed, the judges deliberate to determine the Top 12 acts that will perform at the finale.  The judges choose eight acts together and also have a "judge's choice" act selected by each judge individually to make up the Top 12.

=== Judge's Choice ===

Aside from the eight acts that the judges choose together to be part of the Top 12 as part of the call-back round deliberation process, each judge also selected one act to be their "judge's choice".

=== Finale ===

In the finale, the Top 12 acts each have the opportunity to perform on a large theater stage in front of the judges and a live audience.  Following the performances, the judges eliminate six acts to determine the Top 6 from which the audience will determine the winner.

== Season Synopses ==

=== Season 1 (2013) ===

In the winter of 2012, Seconds2Impact Media announced that it would be launching [[South Korea]]'s first all-English talent search competition with auditions taking place in June 2013.

In May 2013, it was announced that auditions and call-backs would be held at the Seoul Global Culture &amp; Tourism Center in [[Myeong-dong]], [[Seoul]] with the finale to take place at the [[Yongsan]] Art Hall&lt;ref&gt;Kerry, Paul.

Acts that attended the auditions hailed from countries around the world including Canada, the United States, [[Singapore]], [[England]], [[Indonesia]], Australia, the [[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], [[France]], [[Pakistan]] and [[South Korea]].  From the auditions, the judges put through 34 acts to the call-back round which were then whittled down to a Top 12.

Following performances by the Top 12 acts at the finale, the judging panel deliberated to decide which acts would make up the Top 6 and that would face the audience vote.

The winner of season 1 was soul/R&amp;B/gospel singer Sonya-Maria from [[Hawaii]] and the runner-up was juggler Mickael Bellemene - a [[France|French]] national living in [[Singapore]].

=== Season 2 ===

Plans for season 2 of Top Talent have not yet been officially announced by Seconds2Impact Media; however, in a radio interview on July 1, 2013, executive producer and judge C.J. Allen alluded to a second season which might take place in fall 2013 in order to keep up with the momentum of season 1.  Allen also said that if season 2 were to go ahead, he would return as one part of the yet to be announced judging panel.

==Host and Judges==

In March 2013, ''Top Talent'' producers announced that media producer, voice actor and radio personality Elliott Ashby had signed on to host Top Talent.&lt;ref&gt;Top Talent. [http://toptalentkorea.com/2013/03/05/elliott-ashby-to-host-top-talent/ "ELLIOTT ASHBY TO HOST TOP TALENT"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708145123/http://toptalentkorea.com/2013/03/05/elliott-ashby-to-host-top-talent/ |date=2013-07-08 }} ''Top Talent'', Seoul, 5 March 2013. Retrieved on 10 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the weeks that followed the announcement of Ashby as host, ''Top Talent'' began to reveal the names of the personalities that would form the four-person judging panel.  South African native and Korean television personality Bronwyn Mullen was announced as the first judge set to the join followed by Canadian-born media entrepreneur and Seconds2Impact Media CEO C.J. Allen and Punita Bajaj, who had herself competed in a Korean reality television singing competition similar to [[American Idol]].  A midst heavy anticipation, ''Top Talent'' producers announced the fourth judge to be Sam Hammington - the first foreigner to have done comedian in the [[Korean language]] in Korea.  Despite having done a large scale marketing campaign featuring the likenesses of all four judges, Hammington was forced to leave the panel as a result of a conflict with his filming schedule.  Producers responded quickly by filling the vacant judge seat with Seoul based British drum and bass performer MC Lucid.

Following the success of season 1, Allen said he would return to the judging panel for season 2 if it moves forward.  Ashby, Lucid and Bajaj have also expressed interest in returning for a second season but have not been confirmed.

'''Wing Bowl''' was an annual eating contest founded in 1993 by [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] talk-radio hosts [[Angelo Cataldi]] and [[Al Morganti]].  The contest was first broadcast on [[WTEL (AM)|WIP]].   

About 150 people attended Wing Bowl I (held in a hotel) in 1993 to see a competition between two contestants. The event pits [[competitive eater]]s in a [[Buffalo wing]] eating contest. The Wing Bowl is traditionally held on the Friday before the [[Super Bowl]]. The event, which began as a radio promotion, has grown to encompass television, the Internet, and a contest for women who are termed "the Wingettes."

Since 2000, the event was held at Philadelphia's [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]], where it is still broadcast live on 94-WIP-FM. There are currently no television deals to broadcast the event live; however, a replay is usually shown on [[WPSG|CW 57]], [[Comcast SportsNet]], or one of the other local stations within the following week. The Wing Bowl drew crowds of over 20,000. 

The final Wing Bowl, Wing Bowl XXVI was held on February 2, 2018 and the winner was [[Molly Schuyler]], who devoured a record 501 wings in a half hour.

==Background==
Wing Bowl was the brainchild of WIP radio host Al Morganti, who came up with the idea when it became apparent the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] were not going to make the Super Bowl anytime soon. It is also suggested that Morganti was fed up with the Buffalo Bills going to the Super Bowl and not winning. The first Wing Bowl was held in the lobby of the [[Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts|Wyndham]] Franklin Plaza Hotel in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]]. Carmen Cordero walked away with the inaugural title, receiving a [[hibachi]] as his prize.

Since then, media coverage has grown to the point where every one of the major Philadelphia television stations has covered the event. The [[WPVI-TV|ABC 6]], [[KYW-TV|CBS Channel 3]] and [[WTXF-TV|Fox 29]] affiliates all aired live reports from the event during their morning news. Features on the event have appeared in the ''[[Courier-Post]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' and ''[[Philadelphia Daily News|Daily News]]'' as well as a host of newspapers in the surrounding counties. The event has been featured on ESPN and the syndicated television shows ''[[Real TV]]'' and ''[[The Montel Williams Show]]''. Segments on Wing Bowl have appeared on TV newscasts in cities throughout the country. Several Wing Bowl contestants, including "El Wingador," competed in Fox's "[[Glutton Bowl]]" in the spring of 2002. The 2007 Wing Bowl was carried on [[Comcast Cable]]'s [[Video on demand|On Demand]] channel.

Then [[Mayor of Philadelphia]] and future [[Governor of Pennsylvania]] [[Ed Rendell]] attended Wing Bowls II, III, IV and VI, where he presented the winner with a "[[Liberty Bell]]" trophy. Other celebrities who have appeared include retired heavyweight boxer [[Randall "Tex" Cobb]], former [[Philadelphia 76ers|76ers]] President [[Pat Croce]], former [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] manager [[Larry Bowa]], [[U.S. Senator]] [[Arlen Specter]], and others. Major-league [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] [[Eric Gregg]] served as the "Commissioner" of Wing Bowl from its second year until his death from a [[stroke]] on 5 June 2006. From December 2006 to 2013, [[Pat Croce]] was the second commissioner. [[Jon Dorenbos]] has been the third commissioner since 2014.

==Qualifications==
(As per Wing Bowl Commissioner [[Jon Dorenbos]])
Entry into Wing Bowl can be gained in two ways, the first of which is successfully performing an "eating stunt" on air during ''The Morning Show'' at the 94 WIP studios in [[Center City, Philadelphia]], with Al Morganti as judge. Stunts have included eating 20 cups of cooked [[oatmeal]], eating {{convert|3.75|lb|kg}} of [[creamed spinach]] with {{convert|3.75|lb|kg}} of [[hot sauce]], and eating five [[Big Mac]]s. The stunt must be completed within a time limit negotiated between the contestant and Morganti. Morganti, known to be a tough judge, has disallowed stunts that involved what he considers "cheating", such as dipping bread into a beverage to make it easier to swallow, or breaking up a food item into constituent parts for easier chewing (such as separating hot dogs from their buns). He is also tough on contestants who suggest a stunt involving liquid consumption; ''The Morning Show'' hosts prefer eating stunts over drinking stunts. If a person offers to perform a drinking stunt, it must be compelling to the hosts, such as Wing Bowl XIV champion [[Joey Chestnut]]'s offer to drink {{convert|1|gal|l}} of [[milk]]. The hosts deemed it not difficult enough, but, fortunately for Chestnut, former champion Bill "El Wingador" Simmons was present and declared the stunt to have a high level of difficulty, upon which the hosts accepted his offer, with a five-minute time limit to complete the challenge.

The other way to gain entry to Wing Bowl is to win a "Wingoff."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Dato=20100108&amp;Kategori=NEWS01&amp;Lopenr=1080801&amp;Ref=PH "Wing Bowl Wingoff At PJ Whelihan's In Haddonfield"].

Portal to gallery of photographs (45) related to Wing Bowl. ''Courier-Post''. January 15, 2009. Accessed January 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is a 10-minute eating contest held at a Philadelphia or [[South Jersey]] bar hosted by former Philadelphia Eagle and WIP Host Hugh Douglas and WIP Personality Marc Farzetta. The "Wingoffs" began in 2005 when 610 WIP decided to spoof the [[Philadelphia Big 5|Big 5 Philadelphia]] area universities basketball teams. The winner of these "Wingoffs" gain automatic entry into the Wing Bowl.

==Cancellation==
WIP announced on October 30, 2018 that event was being canceled after 26 years because the time for doing so felt right after the Eagles won [[Super Bowl LII]]. According to WIP program director Spike Eskin, "When Wing Bowl started ... a large part of it was the lead-up to the Super Bowl never involved the Eagles. We just wanted to get to the promised land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berkery|first=Sheri|url=https://www.courierpostonline.com/story/news/local/south-jersey/2018/10/30/wing-bowl-wip-ends-competitive-eating-competition-philadelphia/1816859002/|title=WIP ends controversial Wing Bowl's long run in Philadelphia|date=October 30, 2018|newspaper=Courier-Post|access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bryan|first=Cleve|url=https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2018/10/30/94wip-ends-wing-bowl-after-26-years/|title=‘I Think It Ran Its Course’: 94WIP Ends Wing Bowl After 26 Years|date=October 30, 2018|work=[[CBS Philly]]|access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''YourView''' is an Australian [[nonprofit organization|not-for-profit]] [[debate]] website, founded in 2012.

Drawing upon the aims and principles of [[deliberative democracy]] theory, the website promotes considered debate in order to establish the "collective viewpoint" on political and social issues.&lt;ref name="self-about"&gt;{{Cite web | title = About  YourView | publisher = YourView Australia | url = http://yourview.org.au/page/about | accessdate = 27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
YourView is supported by the not-for-profit Ourview Foundation ([[Australian Company Number|ACN]] 154 763 970), established in 2011 by the Australian philosopher [[Tim Van Gelder]] in collaboration with the public intellectual Paul Monk. It is funded by voluntary donations.&lt;ref name="self-about" /&gt;

The site was launched publicly in May 2012 and was maintained and developed by a staff of volunteers based in [[Melbourne]]. The website is currently inactive, and the project on hold.

== Content ==
YourView drew on ideas developed within the [[deliberative democracy]] movement, which promotes rational deliberation as a means of forming opinions and guiding policy decisions.&lt;ref name="theage-1"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Full transcript: Tim van Gelder | publisher = The Age | url = http://www.theage.com.au/national/full-transcript-tim-van-gelder-20120313-1uxzr.html | last = Short | first = Michael | date = 14 March 2012 | accessdate = 27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users initially voted for or against a proposition based on a current issue, and were subsequently invited to post comments to justify their adopted stance. Each debate was prefaced by an "explainer", which provided basic information about the issue being discussed including an outline of key arguments.&lt;ref name="crikey"&gt;{{Cite web | title = New Kid on the Block: YourView, a more considered taste taker | publisher = Crikey | url = http://www.crikey.com.au/2012/02/27/new-kid-on-the-block-yourview-a-more-considered-taste-taker/ | last = Simons | first = Margaret | date = 27 February 2012 | accessdate = 27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its objective to promote constructive and informed debate, YourView used an algorithm to assign each user a credibility score; the algorithm aimed to quantify a series of "[[epistemic virtues]]" that collectively determined the extent to which an individual user has contributed to the deliberative process. The raw "for-against" vote was weighted by user credibility scores to compute a "collective wisdom" metric,&lt;ref name="crikey" /&gt; thereby setting it apart from purely aggregative [[opinion poll]]ing.&lt;ref name="theage-2"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The getting of wisdom | publisher = The Age | url = http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/the-getting-of-wisdom-20120313-1uy8a.html | last = Short | first = Michael | date = 14 March 2012 | accessdate = 27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details about which factors influence the algorithm were not published, which reduced the model's transparency but aimed to prevent users from [[gaming the system]].&lt;ref name="heise"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Software bestraft Schwätzer | publisher = [[:de:Heise Online|Heise Online]] | url = http://www.heise.de/tr/artikel/Software-bestraft-Schwaetzer-1586112.html | last = Grötker | first = Ralf | language = German | date = 31 May 2012 | accessdate = 27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zoran Bečić''' (April 2, 1939 – March 29, 2006) was one of the most prominent artists of the Bosnian theatrical community in the 20th century.

One of the founding actors of [[Sarajevo War Theatre]], he studied acting under the famous Belgrade Academy of Dramatic Arts' Professor Mate Milošević, graduating with the 1966 class. Bečić's professional acting career began in [[Dubrovnik]], but after two years, he joined Sarajevo's [[Malo pozorište]] (Little Theatre), the predecessor of today's [[Kamerni teatar 55]] (Chamber Theatre 55). He made his ''debut'' in the unforgettable performance in Radoslav Dorić's ''Noć ubica'' (The night of murderers).

Following several notable roles, in 1971 he decides to try his luck in Belgrade, but returns to [[Sarajevo's National Theatre]], two years later. For the next two decades, he continues his collaboration with [[Kamerni teatar 55]], earning three ''Zlatni lovorov vijenac'' (Golden Wreath of Laurel) Awards at the international theatre festival [[MESS]]. The last one, in 2004, was given to him for Life Achievement and Contribution to Performing Arts.

During the 1991-1995 [[Sarajevo siege]], Bečić participates in the first theatrical project that was to jump-start [[Sarajevo]]'s war production scene, the famous [[Sklonište]] (The Shelter), and directs another - [[Memoari Mine Hauzen]] (The Memoirs of Mina Hauzen).

Asked about his decision to stay in Sarajevo during the war, he said: "Many have asked me if I, a Serb from Čačak, ever regretted staying in Sarajevo for the duration of the war. Never. God forbid that it ever happens again, but I would do it all over again. With all the sadness, tragedy and horror that this city had been through, there was equally as much warmth, love, understanding and tender words."

Bečić's film and TV credits include appearances in TV series ''[[Viza za budućnost]]'' (2002), and ''Aleksa Santic'' (1990).

In March 2006, he made his first and last appearance alongside his daughter, actress [[Zorana Bečić]], in [[Safet Plakalo]]'s ''Lutkino bespuće'' (A Doll's Wasteland). He died two weeks later on the eve of the premiere of ''Rodoljupci'' at [[Sarajevo]]'s National Theatre, where he was the Director of Drama. Bečić was farewelled at [[Sarajevo]]'s Lav cemetery on the day he was to take to the stage in the role of Zhitov.
