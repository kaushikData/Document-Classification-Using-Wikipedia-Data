'''2C-B''' ('''2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine''') is a [[psychedelic drug]] of the [[2C (psychedelics)|2C family]]. It was first synthesized by [[Alexander Shulgin]] in 1974. In Shulgin's book ''[[PiHKAL]]'', the dosage range is listed as 12–24&amp;nbsp;mg. As a [[recreational drug]], 2C-B is sold as a white powder sometimes pressed in tablets or gel caps and is also referred to by a number of other names.&lt;ref name="DEA - Evaluation Section"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/bromo_dmp/bromo_dmp.pdf |title=2C-B Street Names |date=February 1, 2011 |access-date=2012-09-28 |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016220942/http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/bromo_dmp/bromo_dmp.pdf |archive-date=October 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug is usually taken orally, but can also be snorted ([[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflated]]) or [[Vaporizer (inhalation device)|vaporized]].
{{TOC limit|3}}

== History ==

2C-B was synthesized from [[2,5-Dimethoxybenzaldehyde|2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde]] by [[Alexander Shulgin]] in 1974. It first saw use among the psychiatric community as an aid during therapy.{{cn|date=November 2018}}  2C-B was first sold commercially as a purported [[aphrodisiac]]&lt;ref name="Reappears"/&gt; under the trade name "Erox", which was manufactured by the German pharmaceutical company [[Drittewelle]].&lt;ref name="dritte pack"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drittewelle 2C-B Packaging|url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/show_image.php?i=2cb/2cb_pack2.jpg|publisher=Erowid.org|access-date=25 September 2013|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, it was available as tablets in Dutch [[smart shop]]s under the name "Nexus".

==Patterns of use==
2C-B first became popularized in the United States as a short-lived substitute for the street drug Ecstasy when [[MDMA]] became illegal in 1985.&lt;ref name="Colombia" /&gt; Many 2C-B users are young adults who attend [[rave]]s.&lt;ref name="DEA - Evaluation Section" /&gt;  Though 2C-B is still used in the rave subculture, commonly mistaken for and/or sold as Ecstasy, its intentional use has become more common in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="Gahlinger book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gahlinger|first=Paul | name-list-format = vanc |title=Illegal Drugs: A Complete Guide to Their History, Chemistry, Use and Abuse|year=2004|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780452285057|pages=343–344|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kPszgXPVQAsC&amp;pg=PT463&amp;lpg=PT463#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, 2C-B has emerged as the drug of choice for club drug users in Colombia.&lt;ref name=Colombia&gt;{{cite news |last=Pachico |first=Elyssa | name-list-format = vanc |title='2CB Now Drug of Choice for Colombia Elite'|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/2c-b-now-drug-of-choice-for-colombia-elite|access-date=11 February 2013|newspaper=InSight Crime|date=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Street prices range between $10 and $30 per tablet in the United States in 2011 when purchased in small quantities.&lt;ref name="DEA - Evaluation Section" /&gt; Larger retail purchases cost between $200 and $500 per gram. Wholesale purchases of 2C-B can lower the price ($100 to $300 per gram in 2001{{update inline|date=May 2017}}).&lt;ref name="Reappears"&gt;{{cite web|title=2C-B (Nexus) Reappears on the Club Drug Scene|url=http://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs0/665/665p.pdf|work=National Drug Intelligence Center|publisher=Department of Justice|access-date=11 February 2013  |date=May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity and dosage==

The September 1998 issue of ''[[Journal of Analytical Toxicology]]'' reported that very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, [[metabolism]], and [[toxicity]] of 2C-B. The relationship between its use and death are unknown.&lt;ref name="Reappears" /&gt; The common oral recreational dose is around 15–25&amp;nbsp;mg,&lt;ref name="urlErowid 2C-B Vault : Dose/Dosage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cb/2cb_dose.shtml |title=Erowid 2C-B Vault : Dose/Dosage }}&lt;/ref&gt; at which visual and auditory effects are experienced. Severe adverse reactions are extremely rare, but use of 2C-B has been linked to significant brain injury in one case where the dosage was unknown, and the purity of the chemical was not verified.&lt;ref name="pmid20445431"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ambrose JB, Bennett HD, Lee HS, Josephson SA | title = Cerebral vasculopathy after 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine ingestion | journal = The Neurologist | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 199–202 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20445431 | doi = 10.1097/NRL.0b013e3181a3cb53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lethal dose|lethal dosage]] is unknown. It was reported in ''[[PiHKAL]]'', by [[Alexander Shulgin]], that a psychologist had accidentally taken a 100&amp;nbsp;mg dose orally without apparent harm.&lt;ref name=pihkal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal020.shtml |title=Shulgin, A (1991) ''PIHKAL'' |publisher=Erowid.org |date= |access-date=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When sold as "Ecstasy", tablets containing 2C-B often contain about 5&amp;nbsp;mg of the drug, an amount which produces stimulatory effects that mimic the effects of MDMA; in contrast, tablets marketed as 2C-B have larger quantities of the drug (10–20&amp;nbsp;mg) which cause [[hallucinogen]]ic effects.&lt;ref name="Netherlands 2c-b emergence" /&gt; Street purity of 2C-B, when tested, has been found to be relatively high.&lt;ref name="Review of public domain"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cole MD, Lea C, Oxley N | title = 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-B): a review of the public domain literature | journal = Science &amp; Justice | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 223–4 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12632938 | doi = 10.1016/S1355-0306(02)71832-7 | url = http://lib.mdpu.org.ua/load/Chemistry/Organic%20chemistry/Organic%20syntheses/English%20edition/2c-b.review }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in Spain found that 2C-B samples in the country doubled between 2006 and 2009, switched from primarily powder form to tablets, and exhibited "low falsification rates".&lt;ref name="Spain study"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caudevilla-Gálligo F, Riba J, Ventura M, González D, Farré M, Barbanoj MJ, Bouso JC | title = 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-B): presence in the recreational drug market in Spain, pattern of use and subjective effects | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology | volume = 26 | issue = 7 | pages = 1026–35 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22234927 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1177/0269881111431752 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of street samples in the Netherlands found impurities "in small percentages"; only one of the impurities, the N-acetyl derivative of 2C-B, could be identified, and comprised 1.3% of the sample. The authors suggested that this compound was a by-product of 2C-B synthesis.&lt;ref name="Netherlands 2c-b emergence"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Boer D, Gijzels MJ, Bosman IJ, Maes RA | title = More data about the new psychoactive drug 2C-B | journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 227–8 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10369336 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/jat/23.3.227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
{{medref|section|date=November 2018}}
[[Image:2cb pill.jpg|thumb|right|2C-B pill with [[heart (symbol)|heart]] logo]]

Little or no academic research has been conducted on the effects of 2C-B in humans. The information available is largely [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] and limited. Effects are often described as being more easily managed than other psychedelics;&lt;ref name="erowid basics"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cb/2cb_basics.shtml | title = Erowid 2C-B Vault: Basics | access-date = 2013-09-25 | date = 2011-02-20 | publisher = [[Erowid]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is often compared to a mixture of a [[serotonergic psychedelic]] and [[MDMA]].&lt;ref name="Spain study"/&gt;  At 5–10&amp;nbsp;mg, experiments with young chickens have shown it to produce effects similar to a low dosage of [[amphetamine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bronson ME, Jiang W, DeRuiter J, Clark CR | title = A behavioral comparison of Nexus, cathinone, BDB, and MDA | journal = Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior | volume = 51 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 473–5 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7667371 | doi = 10.1016/0091-3057(95)00013-M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anecdotal effects of 2C-B that have been reported by users on online discussion forums include:&lt;ref name="erowid effects"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cb/2cb_effects.shtml | title = Erowid 2C-B Vault: Effects | access-date = 2013-09-25 | publisher = [[Erowid]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drugscope"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.drugscope.org.uk/resources/drugsearch/drugsearchpages | title = Drugscope: 2C-B | access-date = 2013-09-25 | date = Jan 2004 | publisher = [[Drugscope]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928055351/http://www.drugscope.org.uk/resources/drugsearch/drugsearchpages | archive-date = 2013-09-28 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dancesafe"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dancesafe.org/drug-information/2c-b | title = 2C-B - Dancesafe.org | access-date = 2013-09-25 | publisher = [[Dancesafe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At low doses the experience may shift in intensity from engaging to mild/undetectable. Experienced users report the ability to take control of the effects and switch from engaged to sober at will
* The hallucinations have a tendency to decrease and then increase in intensity, giving the users a sense of “waves” or even glowing. These are popularly described as “clichéd ’70s visuals” or objects taking on "water color" like textures
* While the effects of the drug often render users unable to concentrate deeply on anything in particular, some can become engrossed in an activity such as watching a movie or playing a video game, distracting themselves from the visual and auditory effects of the drug
* Excessive giggling or smiling is common, as is a tendency for deeper “belly laughs”
* Some users say that the effects are more intense when listening to music and report that they can [[Synesthesia|see sounds]] and noises
* Some users experience a decrease in [[visual acuity]], although others report sharper vision
* Increased awareness of one's body; attention may be brought to perceived "imperfections" or internal body processes.

''The following effects are highly dose-dependent.''
* Open eye visuals (OEVs), such as cartoon-like distortions and red or green halos around objects. [[Closed-eye visualization|Closed eye visuals]] (CEVs) are more common than OEVs.
* Affects and alters ability to communicate, engage in deep thought, or maintain attention span.
* Some users report experiencing frightening or fearful effects during the experience. Users describe feeling frigid or cold on reaching a plateau, while others feel wrapped in comfortable blankets/ultimate pleasure.
* Coordination may be affected, some users lose balance or have perceptual distinction problems.
* Onset time of 2C-B is highly dose dependent, but usually from 45 to 75 minutes. Taken on a full stomach, the onset time is increased to two hours or more.
* Before it was scheduled, 2C-B was sold in small doses as an aphrodisiac (see [[2C-B#History|History]]). Some users report [[aphrodisiac]] effects at lower doses.&lt;ref name=pihkal/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drugscope"/&gt;

===Side effects===
* Some users report mild "jitters" (body tremors), shuddering breath, and/or mild muscle spasms after insufflating 2C-B. Whether or not these effects are enjoyable depends on the user
* Mild to intense diarrhea, gas, nausea, and general gastrointestinal discomfort
* Severe headaches after coming down from large doses have been reported. However, many users report a lack of "comedown" or "crash", instead noting a gradual return to sobriety
* At doses over 30–40&amp;nbsp;mg the user may experience frightening hallucinations, as well as [[tachycardia]], [[hypertension]], and [[hyperthermia]]&lt;ref name=carmo&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carmo H, Hengstler JG, de Boer D, Ringel M, Remião F, Carvalho F, Fernandes E, dos Reys LA, Oesch F, de Lourdes Bastos M | title = Metabolic pathways of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-B): analysis of phase I metabolism with hepatocytes of six species including human | journal = Toxicology | volume = 206 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–89 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15590110 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.tox.2004.07.004 | url = https://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDocPartFrame&amp;C=ref&amp;ID=7928&amp;DocPartID=7021 | displayauthors = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2C-B HCl is very painful to insufflate. Anecdotal evidence suggests that 2C-B HBr, the [[hydrobromide]] salt with greater water solubility, is less irritating to the mucous membranes lining the nose but slightly less potent when compared dose-for-dose with the HCl salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://erowid.org/chemicals/2cb/2cb_faq.shtml|title=Erowid 2C-B Vault : FAQ v1.0 |website=erowid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duration===
When orally consumed, 2C-B has a much longer delay before the onset of effects than when it is insufflated. Oral ingestion generally takes roughly 45–75 minutes for the effects to be felt, plateau lasts 2–4 hours, and coming down lasts 1–2 hours. [[Rectal administration]] onset varies from 5–20 minutes. Insufflated onset takes 1–10 minutes for effects to be felt. The duration can last from 4 to 12 hours depending on route of administration, dose, and other factors.&lt;ref name="erowid effects"/&gt;

With insufflation, the effects are more abrupt and intense but have a significantly shorter duration, while oral usage results in a milder, longer experience. When insufflated, the onset happens very rapidly, usually reaching the peak at about 20–40 minutes and plateauing for 2–3 hours. 2C-B is also considered one of the most painful drugs to insufflate, with users reporting intense nasal burning.&lt;ref name="erowid basics"/&gt;  The sudden intensity of the experience combined with the pain can often start the experience with a negative imprint and nausea is also increased with insufflation, compounding the issue.

==Pharmacology==

Unlike most [[hallucinogen]]s, 2C-B has been shown to be a low [[Efficacy (pharmacology)|efficacy]] [[serotonin]] [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] [[partial agonist]] or even full [[Antagonist (drug)|antagonist]].&lt;ref name="moya 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moya PR, Berg KA, Gutiérrez-Hernandez MA, Sáez-Briones P, Reyes-Parada M, Cassels BK, Clarke WP | title = Functional selectivity of hallucinogenic phenethylamine and phenylisopropylamine derivatives at human 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2A and 5-HT2C receptors | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 321 | issue = 3 | pages = 1054–61 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17337633 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.106.117507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WPCleanerAuto1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Villalobos CA, Bull P, Sáez P, Cassels BK, Huidobro-Toro JP | title = 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-B) and structurally related phenylethylamines are potent 5-HT2A receptor antagonists in Xenopus laevis oocytes | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 141 | issue = 7 | pages = 1167–74 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15006903 | pmc = 1574890 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0705722 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] is primarily responsible for mediating the effects experienced by users of 2C-B, although functional antagonism of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; or activation of the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled [[phospholipase D]] pathway may also play a role.&lt;ref name="moya 2007" /&gt; The rank order of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist potency for this family of drugs is [[2C-I]] &gt; 2C-B &gt; [[2C-D]] &gt; [[2C-H]].&lt;ref name="WPCleanerAuto1" /&gt;

Research suggests that 2C-B increases [[dopamine]] levels in the brains of rats, which may contribute to its psychoactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Páleníček T, Fujáková M, Brunovský M, Horáček J, Gorman I, Balíková M, Rambousek L, Syslová K, Kačer P, Zach P, Bubeníková-Valešová V, Tylš F, Kubešová A, Puskarčíková J, Höschl C | title = Behavioral, neurochemical and pharmaco-EEG profiles of the psychedelic drug 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-B) in rats | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 225 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–93 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 22842791 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00213-012-2797-7 | displayauthors = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metabolism===
2C-B has been shown to be metabolized by liver [[hepatocytes]], resulting in [[deamination]] and [[demethylation]] that produces several products. [[Oxidative deamination]] results in the 2-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-ethanol (BDMPE) and 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenylacetic acid (BDMPAA) [[metabolites]]. Additionally, 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid (BDMBA) can also be produced by oxidative deamination. Further metabolism of BDMPE and BDMPAA may occur by demethylation. Alternatively, the later metabolites can be generated by demethylation of 2C-B followed by oxidative deamination.&lt;ref name=carmo/&gt;

There is species differentiation in the metabolism of 2C-B. Mice hepatocytes produce 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxy-phenol (BDMP), a previously unknown metabolite. Meanwhile, human, monkey and rabbit hepatocytes produce 2-(4-bromo-2-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-ethanol (B-2-HMPE), but dog, rat and mouse hepatocytes do not.&lt;ref name=carmo/&gt; 2C-B also reduces aggressive responses in drugged rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muehlenkamp F, Lucion A, Vogel WH | title = Effects of selective serotonergic agonists on aggressive behavior in rats | journal = Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 671–4 | date = April 1995 | pmid = 7617717 | doi = 10.1016/0091-3057(95)00351-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analogues and derivatives===
{{2C-B analogues and derivatives}}

A variety of N-substituted derivatives of 2C-B have been tested, including N-methyl-2CB, N,N-dimethyl-2CB, N-ethyl-2CB and N-benzyl-2CB. Most simple [[alkyl]] derivatives were considerably less potent than 2C-B, with N-ethyl-2CB for instance having a 40 times lower affinity for the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. The N-[[Benzyl group|benzyl]] derivative however was found to have higher [[binding affinity]] than 2C-B itself, with N-(4-bromobenzyl)-2CB binding even more tightly.&lt;ref name="pmid8027974"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glennon RA, Dukat M, el-Bermawy M, Law H, De los Angeles J, Teitler M, King A, Herrick-Davis K | title = Influence of amine substituents on 5-HT2A versus 5-HT2C binding of phenylalkyl- and indolylalkylamines | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 37 | issue = 13 | pages = 1929–35 | date = June 1994 | pmid = 8027974 | doi = 10.1021/jm00039a004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This initial research did not include functional assays of activity, but later led to the development of potent substituted N-benzyl derivatives such as [[25B-NBOMe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |url=http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/diss/receive/FUDISS_thesis_000000001221 |first=Ralf |last=Heim | name-list-format = vanc |title=Synthese und Pharmakologie potenter 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;-Rezeptoragonisten mit N-2-Methoxybenzyl-Partialstruktur: Entwicklung eines neuen Struktur-Wirkungskonzepts |trans-title=Synthesis and pharmacology of potent 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonists which have a partial N-2-methoxybenzyl structure: Development of a new structure-activity concept |type= |language=German |publisher=[[Free University of Berlin]] |date=March 19, 2004 |access-date=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[25B-NBOH]].

== Entheogenic use ==

2C-B is used as [[entheogen]] by the [[Sangoma]], [[Nyanga people|Nyanga]], and [[Xhosa people#Folklore and religion|Amagqirha]] people in place of their traditional plants; they refer to the chemical as ''Ubulawu Nomathotholo'', which roughly translates to "''Medicine of the Singing Ancestors''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tacethno.com/info/2cb/2cbhistory.html#South%20Africa |title=2CB chosen over traditional entheogen's by South African healers. |publisher=Tacethno.com |date=2008-03-27 |access-date=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cb/2cb_article1.shtml The Nexus Factor - An Introduction to 2C-B] Erowid&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/show_image.php?i=2cb/ubulawu_pack.jpg Ubulawu Nomathotholo Pack] Photo by Erowid. © 2002 Erowid.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug prohibition laws==

===United Nations===
The [[United Nations|UN]] [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] added 2C-B to Schedule II of the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] in March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |title=List of psychotropic substances under international control | work = Green List | edition = 23rd | date = August 2003 | publisher = International Narcotics Control Board |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302130637/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |archive-date=2 March 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2C-B was mislabelled "2 C-B" in the ''Green List 26th edition, 2015''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = List of Psychotropic Substances under International Control| url = https://www.incb.org/documents/Psychotropics/greenlist/Green_list_ENG_2015_new.pdf | work = Green List | edition = 26th | date = 2015 | publisher = International Narcotics Control Board | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221104/https://www.incb.org/documents/Psychotropics/greenlist/Green_list_ENG_2015_new.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 21 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was corrected in ''Green List 27th edition, 2016''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = List of Psychotropic Substances under International Control | url = https://www.incb.org/documents/Psychotropics/greenlist/2016/V1604744_Eng.pdf | work = Green List | edition = 27th | date = 2016 | publisher = International Narcotics Control Board | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170421003842/https://www.incb.org/documents/Psychotropics/greenlist/2016/V1604744_Eng.pdf | archive-date = 2017-04-21 | access-date = 2017-04-20 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2C-B is a scheduled drug in most jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cb/2cb_law.shtml |title=Erowid 2C-B page}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a partial list of territories where the substance has been scheduled.

===Countries===

====Argentina====
2C-B is controlled under the List 1, as well as similar substances like [[2C-I]] or [[2C-T-2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cicad.oas.org/fortalecimiento_institucional/legislations/PDF/AR/decreto_299.pdf|title=Last Argentina Controlled Drugs List |publisher=|format=PDF |access-date=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simpson was charged with manufacturing the substance in Sydney. Alexander Shulgin came to Australia to testify on behalf of the defense, to no avail.

2C-B is not specifically listed in the Australia [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (October 2015), however similar drugs such as [[2C-T-2]] and [[2C-I]] are making 2C-B fall under the Australian analogue act.&lt;ref name="Poisons Standard"&gt;Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
In Spain, 2C-B was added to Category 2 prohibited substances in 2002.

====Sweden====
2C-B is currently classified as Schedule I in Sweden.

2C-B was first classified as "health hazard" under the act [[:sv:Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor|''Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor'']] (translated: ''Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health'') as of April 1, 1999, under SFS 1999:58&lt;ref name='Sweden 1999:58'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/fakta/a9990058.HTM | title = Förordning (1999:58) om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varo | access-date = 2013-10-01 | date = 1999-02-25 | language = Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; that made it illegal to sell or possess.

====UK====
All drugs in the 2C family are Class A under the [[Drugs controlled by the UK Misuse of Drugs Act|Misuse of Drugs Act]] which means they are illegal to produce, supply or possess. Possession carries a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment while supply is punishable by life imprisonment and an unlimited fine.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/advice/factfile_az/2cb | title = BBC - Advice - 2CB | access-date = 2013-10-01 | publisher = [[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
In the United States, 2C-B is classified as CSA Schedule I Section (d) Subsection (3) 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.

In the [[United States]], a notice of proposed rulemaking published on December 20, 1994, in the ''[[Federal Register]]'' and after a review of relevant data, the Deputy Administrator of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) proposed to place 4-[[Bromine|bromo]]-[[2C-H|2,5-DMPEA]] into [[Schedule I (US)|Schedule I]], making 2C-B illegal in the United States.&lt;ref name="fedreg"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Schedules of Controlled Substances; Proposed Placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I | journal = Federal Register | date = 20 December 1994 | volume = 59 | issue = 243 | page = 65521| id = | url = http://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/FR/59FR65521.pdf | format = PDF | access-date = 2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became permanent law on July 2, 1995.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In addition to its use in a Christian context, '''abbot''' is a term used in English-speaking countries for a [[Bhikkhu|monk]] who holds the position of administrator of a [[Buddhist]] [[Monastery#Buddhism|monastery]] or large [[Temple#Buddhist temples|Buddhist temple]].&lt;ref name="baroni"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baroni|first=Helen Josephine|title=The illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism|page=1|publisher= Rosen Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/?id=smNM4ElP3XgC|year=2002|ISBN=978-0-8239-2240-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhist nunneries, the nun who holds the equivalent position is known in English as the '''abbess'''.

The English word "abbot" is used instead of all the various words that exist in the languages of the countries where Buddhism is, or was historically, well established.

== Responsibilities ==
The administrative duties of an abbot or abbess include overseeing the day-to-day running of the monastery.&lt;ref name="baroni" /&gt;&lt;ref name="monastic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buswell|first=Robert E.|title=The Zen Monastic Experience: Buddhist Practice in Contemporary Korea|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1993|page=110|ISBN=978-0-691-03477-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbot or Abbess also has spiritual responsibility for the monastics under their care, and is required to interact with the abbots or abbesses of other monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawton|first=Kim|title=Buddhist Abbot Nicholas Vreeland|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/2012/06/15/june-15-2012-buddhist-abbot-nicholas-vreeland/11256/|publisher=[[PBS]]|date=June 15, 2012|accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Languages other than English ==
Asian countries where Buddhism is still widely practiced have words in their own languages for the abbot of a Buddhist monastery or large temple:

=== Chinese ===

in Chinese [[Chan Buddhist]] monasteries, one word for abbot  is ''Fangzhang'' meaning "ten feet square", a reference to the size of [[Vimalakirti]]'s stone room.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buswell Jr.|first1=Robert E.|last2=Lopez Jr.|first2=Donald S.|title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2013|page=295|ISBN= 978-1-4008-4805-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Chinese word for abbot is ''Zhuchi''(住持), meaning dweller and upholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.sfsu.edu/rone/Buddhism/BuddhistDict/BDA.html|publisher=Buddhist Text Translation Society |title=Buddhism A to Z: A entries|accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Zen]] Buddhism, the most commonly used Japanese words for the abbot of a large Zen temple or Zen monastery are ''juji''(住持)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=abbot (jūjishoku 住持職, jūji 住持, jūshoku 住職)|url=http://global.sotozen-net.or.jp/eng/library/glossary/individual.html?key=abbot|publisher=Sōtō Zen International|accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''choro''.&lt;ref name="baroni" /&gt;

=== Tibetan ===
The abbot of a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] monastery is known as the ''[[Khenpo]]''. This means "the one who gives the monks vows". The abbot is addressed as, and referred to, as "Khen Rinpoche". Another word used for more senior abbots is ''Khenchen'', which means senior khenpo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodhipath.org/index.php?id=322|title=Shamar Rinpoche's explanation of the proper use of the titles "Khenchen" and "Khenpo"|publisher=Bodhi Path Buddhist Center|accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Eras of the Halakha}}
'''Bahya ben Asher ibn Halawa''', also known as '''Rabbeinu Behaye''' (רבינו בחיי, 1340 – 1255), was a [[rabbi]] and scholar of [[Judaism]]. He was a commentator on the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]].

He is considered by Jewish scholars to be one of the most distinguished of the Biblical exegetes of [[Spain]]. He was a pupil of Rabbi [[Shlomo ben Aderet]] (the ''Rashba''). Unlike the latter, R' Bahya did not publish a Talmud commentary. In his biblical exegesis, R' Bahya took as his model Rabbi Moses ben Nahman who is known as [[Nahmanides]] or Ramban, the teacher of Rabbi Solomon ben Aderet, who was the first major commentator to make extensive use of the Kabbalah as a means of interpreting the Torah. He discharged with zeal the duties of a ''darshan'' ("preacher") in his native city of [[Zaragoza]], sharing this position with several others, and on this account received a small salary, which was scarcely enough to support him and his family; but neither his struggle for daily bread nor the reverses that he suffered (to which he referred in the introduction to his commentary on the Torah) diminished his interest in [[Torah study]] in general, and in [[Biblical exegesis]] in particular.

[[Image:TsiyounRibbiBeHaye wetalmidayw.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Tsiyun'' of ''Rabbeinu Behayé'' and his [[yeshiva|''talmidim'']], ''`Hokok'' in the [[Galilee|''Galil'']], [[Israel]]]]

==His Torah commentary==
Among R Bahya's principal works was his commentary on the [[Torah]] (the five books of Moses), in the preparation of which he thoroughly investigated the works of former Biblical exegetes, using all the methods employed by them in his interpretations.

He enumerates the following four methods, all of which in his opinion are indispensable to the exegete:
#The ''peshat,'' the "plain" meaning of the text in its own right.
#The [[midrash]] or the [[Aggadah|aggadic]] exegesis.
#[[Logic]]al analysis and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] exegesis. His aim is to demonstrate that philosophical truths are already embodied in the Bible, which as a work of [[God]] transcends all the wisdom of man. He therefore recognizes the results of philosophical thought only insofar as they do not conflict with Jewish tradition.
#The method of the Kabbalah, termed by him "the path of light," which the truth-seeking soul must travel. It is by means of this method, Rabbeinu Behaye believes, that the deep mysteries hidden in the Bible may be revealed.

Generally speaking Rabbi Bahya does not reveal any of his Kabbalistic sources, other than generally referring to ''Sefer ha-[[Bahir]]'' and the works of [[Nahmanides]]. He only mentions the [[Zohar]] twice.

R' Bahya's commentary is considered to derive a particular charm from its form. Each [[Parsha|parashah]], or weekly lesson, is prefaced by an introduction preparing the reader for the fundamental ideas to be discussed; and this introduction bears a motto in the form of some verse selected from the [[Book of Mishlei / Proverbs]]. Furthermore, by the questions that are frequently raised the reader is compelled to take part in the author's mental processes; the danger of monotony being also thereby removed.

==Printings==

The commentary was first printed at [[Naples]] in 1492; and the favor which it enjoyed is attested by the numerous supercommentaries published on it. Owing to the large space devoted to the Kabbalah, the work was particularly valuable to Kabbalists, although Rabbi Bahya also availed himself of non-Jewish sources. Later editions of the commentary appeared at Pesaro, 1507, 1514, and 1517; Constantinople, 1517; Rimini, 1524; Venice, 1544, 1546, 1559, 1566, and later. Not less than ten super-commentaries are enumerated by Bernstein (''Monatsschrift'' xviii. 194-196), which give further evidence of the popularity of the work.

==Other works==
His next most famous work was his ''Kad ha-Kemah'' ("Receptacle of the Flour") (Constantinople, 1515.) It consists of sixty chapters, alphabetically arranged, containing discourses and dissertations on the requirements of religion and morality, as well as Jewish ritual practices. ''Kad ha-Kemah'' is a work of [[Musar literature]], the purpose of which is to promote a moral life. In it Bahye discusses the following subjects: belief and faith in God; the divine attributes and the nature of providence; the duty of loving God, and of walking before God in simplicity and humility of heart; the fear of God; [[Jewish prayer]]; benevolence, and the love of mankind; peace; the administration of [[justice]], and the sacredness of the oath; the duty of respecting the property and honor of one's fellow man; the [[Jewish holidays]], and [[halakha]] (loosely translated as "Jewish law".)

Another work of R Bahya, also published frequently, and in the first Mantua edition of 1514 erroneously ascribed to Rabbi Moses ben Nahman, [[Nahmanides]], bears the title of ''Shulkhan Arba'' ("Table [of] Four"). It consists of four chapters, the first three of which contain religious rules of conduct regarding the various meals, while the fourth chapter treats of the banquet of the righteous in the world to come.

A work might have been written by Rabbi Bahye under the title of ''Hoshen ha-Mishpat'' ("Breastplate of Judgment".) Reference to this work is made only once by him, and it is unknown if this work was actually written or not.

===Works incorrectly attributed to him===
A number of works whose author is simply "Bahya", or whose authors are unknown, have been attributed to Rabbi Bahye ben Asher. Many modern day authorities on Rabbi Bahya's writings have shown that many of these attributions are spurious.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

*''Ha-Emunah ve-ha-Bittahon'' (Korets, 1785)
*''Ma'arekhet ha-Elohut'' (Mantua, 1558)
*''Ma'amar ha-Sekhel'' (Cremona, 1557)

One book ostensibly written by R' Bahya, edited by M. Homburg under the title of ''Soba Semakhot'' ("Fulness of Joy"), as being a commentary on the [[Book of Job]], is actually a compilation made by a later editor from two of Bahye's actual works, ''Kad ha-Kemah'' (Constantinople, 1515) and ''Shulhan shel Arba'' (Mantua, 1514).

==Analysis==
Rabbeinu Behaye's works possess especial value both for the student of Jewish literature, owing to the author's copious and extensive quotations from [[Midrash]]ic and exegetical works which have since been lost, and for the student of modern languages on account of the frequent use of words from the vernacular (Arabic, Spanish, and French) in explanation of Biblical terms. They also contain interesting material for the study of the social life as well as for the history of the Kabalah, the demonology and eschatology of the Jews in Spain. &lt;!-- as Bernstein in his instructive article (l.c.) has shown. --&gt;

==Life and career==

Born on 2 October 1914 in [[Battersea]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], Bernarr Rainbow was the son of Ephraim James Rainbow (1888-1983), a cabinet-maker at [[Buckingham Palace]], who later became the Curator of pictures at [[Hampton Court]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainbow first became a church chorister when his family moved to [[Clapham]], and he was intrigued by watching the organist play. 

After another move he attended [[Rutlish School]] in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]]. Even though he still at school, Bernarr was appointed the organist and choirmaster at St James's, Merton, later holding similar posts at St Mary's, East Molesey and St Andrew's, Wimbledon.&lt;ref name ="ODNB"/&gt;

After his family moved to Hampton Court, Bernarr attended [[Trinity College of Music]] between 1933–1939, where he was a pupil of Dr [[William Lovelock]].&lt;ref name ="Independent"&gt;{{Cite news

In September 1944 he became Organist of the Parish Church of All Saints, High Wycombe and, a few months later, the Senior Music Master at [[Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe]].&lt;ref name="appreciation"/&gt; He made a considerable public impact at High Wycombe. He produced [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operettas at the Royal Grammar School, put on concerts at the Parish Church, and started a week-long annual Festival there in 1946.  Bernarr's pupils won awards and scholarships and in 1947 representatives from 30 local choirs joined in Handel's Messiah. Bernarr conducted the High Wycombe String Orchestra and was the soloist in his own Piano Concerto. In 1951 the High Wycombe Parish Church Choir was chosen to sing Evensong in the Festival Church on the new South Bank site.  He turned the Royal Grammar School at High Wycombe into a singing school. Bemarr realised that the quality of music teaching in schools was paramount. This meant focussing on the teachers themselves. So in 1952 he became Director of Music at [[College of St Mark &amp; St John|The College of St. Mark and St. John]], Chelsea, the Church of England College for teachers, a remarkable community whose members have stayed friends. Later he became Head of Music at Gypsy Hill College, now Kingston University, and retired in 1978.

His distinguished record was acknowledged when he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1994 and an Honorary Fellow of Trinity College in the following year. He was President of the Campaign for the Defence of the Traditional Cathedral Choir and in 1996 he established the Bernarr Rainbow Award for School Music Teachers.

Bernarr Rainbow died in Esher, Surrey on 17 March 1998 at the age of 83.&lt;ref name ="Independent"/&gt;

'''William Frederick Gibbons''' (born December 16, 1949)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Happy Birthday, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top!|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2580187/billy-gibbons-zz-top-birthday/|publisher=MTV|date=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, and actor, best known as the guitarist and lead singer of American rock band [[ZZ Top]]. He began his career in the [[Moving Sidewalks]], who recorded ''Flash'' (1968) and opened four dates for the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]]. Gibbons formed ZZ Top in late 1969 and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' in 1971. 

Gibbons has made appearances with other artists and acted on television shows, most notably ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]''. He was ranked at number 32 on the 2011 ''Rolling Stone'' list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Guitarists|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/billy-gibbons-20111122|accessdate=January 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gibbons was born to Frederick Royal ("Freddie") and Lorraine (née Duffy) Gibbons in the [[List of Houston neighborhoods#T|Tanglewood]] neighborhood of [[Houston, Texas]]. His father was an entertainer, [[orchestra conductor]], and [[concert pianist]] who worked alongside his second cousin, art director [[Cedric Gibbons]], for [[Samuel Goldwyn]] at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM Studios]]. A percussionist as a youth, Gibbons was sent by his father to [[New York City]] to study with [[Tito Puente]]&lt;ref name=RhythmMusicMagazine&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russel|first1=K.F.|title=ZZ Top|journal=Rhythm Music Magazine|date=1997|volume=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hK84AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=billy+gibbons+tito+puente&amp;dq=billy+gibbons+tito+puente&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAGoVChMImqyf8r6GyQIVAkSICh3kHAHf|quote=...got into Afro-Caribbean rhythms as a youth when his father sent him to New York to study percussion with Tito Puente.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Gibbons received his first electric guitar following his 13th birthday, a [[Sunburst (finish)|sunburst]] [[Gibson Melody Maker]], accompanied by a [[Fender Champ]] [[amplifier]], and was influenced by guitarists such as [[Jimmy Reed]].

While attending Warner Brothers' art school in [[Hollywood, California]], Gibbons engaged with his first bands including The Saints, Billy G &amp; the Blueflames, and The Coachmen. By 18, Gibbons went forward forming an artfully designed band, conceptually inspired by friend and fellow musician, [[Roky Erickson]] and The [[13th Floor Elevators]], naming the group the Moving Sidewalks, penning the hit single "99th Floor", and engaging in a friendship with [[Jimi Hendrix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.klru.org/texasmonthlytalks/archive/gibbons.php |title=Texas Monthly Talks |publisher=KLRU |accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ROCK-AND-ROLL |first=Laurie E. |last=Jasinski |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/xbrwj |work=[[Handbook of Texas|Handbook of Texas Online]] |publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]] |accessdate=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==

===Moving Sidewalks===
{{Main|Moving Sidewalks}}
Gibbons founded the Texas psychedelic group The Moving Sidewalks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/news/zz_top_is_zee_tops_/Content?oid=33833|title=ZZ Top Is Zee Tops!  (Why ZZ Top is the World's Greatest Band!)|last=Chest|first=Lance|date=June 9, 2005|publisher=Portland Mercury|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which recorded several singles and one full-length album, ''[[Flash (Moving Sidewalks album)|Flash]]''. Gibbons and The Moving Sidewalks came to prominence opening for [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] during Hendrix's first American tour as a headliner. Also notable was the Gibbons-penned song, "99th Floor," its title a nod to the influence on Gibbons of fellow Texans and pioneering psychedelic band [[The 13th Floor Elevators]]. He has also commented during live performances while playing the string-bending intro to "[[Foxy Lady]]" that Hendrix taught him how to play when Gibbons was "about 17" in Dallas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlvERQa9fkg|title=ZZ TOP - Foxy Lady|publisher=YouTube|date=2012-07-16|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ZZ Top===
{{Main|ZZ Top}}
Gibbons formed ZZ Top in late 1969, and quickly settled on bassist/vocalist [[Dusty Hill]] and drummer [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank "Rube" Beard]], both being members of the band [[American Blues]]. After honing their trademark [[blues-rock]] style, they released the aptly-titled ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' on London Records in 1971.

[[File:Billy_Gibbons_12_7_13_Alamodome.jpg|thumb|Billy Gibbons at The Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas 12/7/13, private function]]

===Other music-related appearances===
Gibbons played the first [[slide guitar]] lead on the song "Dead End Streets" on [[Al Jourgensen]] of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]'s side project [[Revolting Cocks]] album ''[[Cocked and Loaded]]''.

ZZ Top's "Precious and Grace" was recorded with lead vocals provided by [[Mark Lanegan]] as a bonus track for the album. Gibbons has claimed this was one of his favorite collaborations and "Precious and Grace" was later added back into ZZ Top's set lists. Gibbons was selected to guest the follow-up album ''[[Era Vulgaris (album)|Era Vulgaris]]'' but was unable due to scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052772/reznor-guest-spot-adds-mystery-to-qotsa-album|title=Reznor Guest Spot Adds Mystery To QOTSA Album|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan |date=April 13, 2007|work=News &gt; Articles|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[The Raconteurs]] Gibbons performed at the [[2006 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Gibbons was part of an ensemble chosen to play with the band, which included [[Lou Reed]] and [[Jim Jarmusch]]. The performance was heavily edited and cut short by MTV for broadcast. &lt;!-- it's OR until you prove it: However, the full unedited performance is available on MTV's Website for the VMAs. Although not a full-length performance, Gibbons can also be heard playing a few bars of the ZZ Top classic "[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]." --&gt;

Gibbons was one of several artists to join [[B.B. King]] on the song "Tired Of Your Jive," from the ''B.B. King &amp; Friends'' album. 

Gibbons appeared on [[Nickelback]]'s album ''[[All the Right Reasons]]'' on the songs "Follow You Home," "Fight for All the Wrong Reasons" and "[[Rockstar (Nickelback song)|Rockstar]]." 

Gibbons performed with [[Hank Williams III]] on the song "Trashville," from his album ''[[Lovesick, Broke and Driftin']].''

Gibbons collaborated with [[Les Paul]] with his Les Paul &amp; Friends ''American Made, World Played'' track "Bad Case of Loving You." Gibbons also performed guitar with [[John Mayall]] &amp; Friends' track "Put It Right Back" from the album ''Along for the Ride.'' He was the first artist to appear on stage at Cleveland's State theater in November 2008 at the American Music Master Tribute to Les Paul, honoring the guitar and recording innovator, who died a few months later.

Gibbons was a guest vocalist on [[Kid Rock]]'s "Hillbilly Stomp" from the album ''[[Kid Rock (album)|Kid Rock]]''.

He was the guitarist during singer [[Luis Fonsi]]'s presentation at the 7th [[Latin Grammy]] awards held in [[Madison Square Garden]], New York, on November 2, 2006. 

Lately{{when|date=April 2018}} Gibbons sang background vocals on [[Sammy Hagar]]'s 2008 CD ''[[Cosmic Universal Fashion]]'' during the song "Switch on the Light." 

Gibbons collaborated with [[Ronnie Dunn]], of [[Brooks &amp; Dunn]] fame, for Dunn's first solo work, playing guitar and singing along on the song, "[[Honky Tonk Stomp]]". 

Gibbons played guitar on "Broke Down On the Brazos", the opening track of [[Gov't Mule]]'s 2009 album ''[[By a Thread (Gov't Mule album)|By a Thread]]''. 

Gibbons played guitar on "Run Rudolph Run", the third track of ''[[We Wish you a Metal Xmas and a Headbanging New Year]]'' compilation. 

Gibbons joined [[Jeff Beck]] onstage at the 2009 [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame#25th Anniversary concert|25th Anniversary Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Concert]] with a version of [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s "[[Foxy Lady]]".

==Other projects==

===Television===
Gibbons had a recurring role on the [[Fox network]] TV series ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', appearing in seven episodes over nine years. He plays a fictionalized version of himself, as the father of [[Michaela Conlin]]'s character, [[Angela Montenegro|Angela Pearly Gates Montenegro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://communityvoices.post-gazette.com/arts-entertainment-living/tuned-in/item/37855-tv-q-a-bones-gma-and-various-local-news-anchors-who-dared-to-take-vacation-time|title=TV Q&amp;A: 'Bones,' 'GMA' and various local news anchors who dared to take vacation time|last=Owen|first=Rob|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=April 4, 2014|accessdate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is never referred to by name on the show, though; every mention is limited to "Angela's father". Conlin's character's middle name is the same as Gibbons' [[Les Paul guitar]]. Gibbons's character is extremely protective of his daughter, and he often "threatens" or "haunts" Angela's husband and colleague [[Jack Hodgins (Bones)|Dr. Jack Hodgins]], telling him that if he hurts Angela, he will pay. When Angela and Hodgins first broke up, he drugged and kidnapped Hodgins, during which time he also gave him a tattoo of Angela's face on his left deltoid area. After Angela discovers the tattoo, she informs Hodgins she wants it removed (he never removed it) and angrily exclaimed when she discovered it was her dad's doing, "I am so going to kick his Texan bad ass".

He has appeared in several other episodes of ''Bones'', including one where he asks Hodgins to help him recover his car from some "biker hoods". In his next appearance, he argued with Hodgins over baby names. He wanted the child to be named "Staccato Mamba", which came to him in a song, while Angela and Hodgins wanted to name him "Michael Joseph". (Parents and grandfather compromised on "Michael Staccato".)&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Michael. Bones, "The Killer in the Crosshairs," first aired March 10, 2011. Retrieved September 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the episode, Hodgins discovers he has yet another tattoo on his right biceps, this time of his father-in-law with the word "Daddy" across Gibbons' beard (at which point Gibbons told Hodgins that celebratory tequila and he do not seem to mix). In a later episode, he asks to babysit his grandson Michael, pointing out that Angela had spent many nights when she was a baby sleeping soundly backstage while he played to sold-out stadiums. After initial reluctance of Angela and Hodgins, they agree due to the need to get some sleep, as Michael will not stop crying and go to sleep. Gibbons solves the problem by discovering the music Michael likes, including [[blues]] and [[boogie rock]], such as ZZ Top's "Hi Fi Mama".

Gibbons voiced a character in episode 60 of ''[[Metalocalypse]]''.

Gibbons also voiced a fictionalised version of himself in Fox's animated show ''[[King of the Hill]]'' which is set in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas. ZZ Top's appearance on the show was due to Dusty Hill being given the role as the cousin of the show's main character [[Hank Hill]]. Frank Beard also voiced himself for the band's appearances on the show.

Gibbons appeared as a dining room guest in the season-13 episode of ''[[Hell's Kitchen (U.S. TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]''.

===BFG Brand sauces===
In 2011, Gibbons joined with Texas-based Mojo Products, LLC, to launch a line of hot sauces, barbecue sauces, and other products with his own personal branding, "BFG Brand". The sauces were sold as BFG No. 44 via his personal website.

In late 2012, Gibbons was featured in a series of television commercials for [[Fiesta Mart]], a Texas supermarket chain. Some of the BFG Brand sauces were seen in these commercials.

In 2018 Billy Gibbons has teamed up with John Fogerty, the two guitar players are planning a summer tour under the "Holy Grail" title. John Fogerty wrote a song with the title "Holy Grail" which Gibbons has appeared on, adding his vocals and some guitar, Billy had this to say to 'Billboard Magazine': " "It's not an overstatement to say that writing a song with John Fogerty is a genuine bonus. It's fair to say that John and I are both pumped about our collaboration and we think this new one called 'Holy Grail' holds true with some great storytelling and some solid guitarist movin' the number right along. It begs a shout of, 'Turn it up!'" Fogerty is releasing a new album, and the collaboration is attracting some attention from the classic rock community. The new single "Holy Grail" is due for worldwide release on June 8th 2018.

==Personal life==
On December 14, 2005, Gibbons married long-time girlfriend Gilligan Stillwater (born Ellen J. Oetjen).&lt;ref&gt;Texas Marriage Index, 1966-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbons is an avid car collector and custom car enthusiast with an extensive collection that includes a 1948 Cadillac Series 62 (known as [[CadZZilla]]), a 1962 Chevrolet Impala (known as "Slampala"), a 1950 Ford Business Coupe, and a 1958 Ford Thunderbird.&lt;ref name=ComplexCars&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=The 20 Biggest Celebrity Car Collectors|url=http://www.complex.com/sports/2012/03/the-20-biggest-celebrity-car-collectors/billy-f-gibbons|website=www.complex.com|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his earliest custom cars, a 1933 Ford Coupe (known as "Eliminator"), was featured in three of ZZ Top's music videos and is also on the cover of their 1983 album, also titled ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]''. Gibbons also published a book in 2011 about his love of cars and guitars titled ''Billy F Gibbons: Rock + Roll Gearhead''.&lt;ref name=Gearhead&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbons|first1=Billy F.|last2=Vickers|first2=Tom|last3=Photography: Perry|first3=David|title=Billy F.

For several years, Gibbons has appeared wearing a braided-cloth cap rather than his familiar [[Stetson hat]]. During a visit to [[Vienna]], he met the chief of the [[Bamileke people]] from [[Camaroon]], with whom he traded the hat for the cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hillary Alexander |newspaper=The Telegraph |title=ZZ Top: Billy Gibbons interview |date=16 September 2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL-hCd-x_oU }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5450">'''Buddhābhiseka''' ({{lang-pi|buddhābhiseka}}; {{lang-sa|buddhābhiṣeka}}) refers to a broad range of Buddhist rituals used to [[consecrate]] [[cult image|image]]s of the [[Buddha]] and other Buddhist figures, such as [[bodhisattva]]s.&lt;ref name="buswell"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|last=Jr|first=Robert E. Buswell|last2=Jr|first2=Donald S. Lopez|date=2013-11-24|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400848058|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Terms==
Buddhābhiseka is known a number of different terms in various languages.&lt;ref name="buswell"/&gt; The terms '''''kaiyan''''' ({{zh|t=開眼|l=opening the eyes|labels=no}}), '''''kaiguang''''' ({{zh|t=開光|l=opening the light|labels=no}}), and '''''dianyan'''''  ({{zh|t=點眼|l=dotting the eyes|labels=no}}) and their derivative forms are used in the Chinese, [[Korean language|Korean]] (where is it known as '''''jeom-an''''' or 점안), [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (where it is known as '''''kaigen''''') and [[Vietnamese language]]s (where it is known as '''''khai quang điểm nhãn'''''),&lt;ref name="buswell"/&gt; while '''''buddhābhiseka''''' ({{lang-my|ဗုဒ္ဓါဘိသေက}}; {{lang-km|ពុទ្ធាភិសេក}}; {{lang-th|พุทธาภิเษก}}) is used in predominantly Theravada Buddhist countries.

==Chinese rituals==
'''Kaiguang''' ({{zh|t=開光|s=开光|k=kāiguāng}}) is the Chinese term for [[consecration]] of a statue of a deity. In Chinese, the literal meaning of Kaiguang is "opening of light". While it is often performed in the [[Buddhist]] and [[Taoist]] faiths, it is also well known as the act of consecrating new lion costumes used for the traditional [[lion dance]].

A kaiguang ritual varies amongst traditions, but it is essentially the act of formal consecration for proper usage by dotting the eyes of a statue or lion costume using an [[Ink brush|calligraphy brush]] coated with [[cinnabar]]. In Taoism and Buddhism, the ritual is performed by senior clerics and is done by inviting a specific deity, buddha or bodhisattva to empower an "empty" effigy of themselves and to fill it with a divine essence. The usage of a mirror (to reflect the sunlight) and a dry towel (to symbolically clean the statue of filth) is also employed. 

It is believed that if a statue or lion costume has not gone through kaiguang, it cannot be worshiped or used for performance, as the eyes are still "closed".

==Burmese rituals==
[[Buddhism in Myanmar|Burmese Buddhists]] perform consecration rituals for images of the Buddha used for veneration both at home and at public places of worship, such as monasteries and pagodas. Before a Buddha statue is used for veneration, it must be formally consecrated in the '''buddhābhiseka maṅgala''' ritual. The [[Burmese language]] verb for consecrating a Buddha image is ''anegaza tin'' ({{lang|my|[[:my:အနေကဇာတင်ခြင်း|အနေကဇာတင်ခြင်း]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usamyanmar.net/Buddha/Article/Buddha%20Shrine.pdf|title=Preparation for A Place of Worship At Home|last=Paw|first=Maung H.|page=4|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This consecration ritual is led by a Buddhist monk, who recites ''aneka jāti saṃsāraṃ'' (translated as 'through the round of many births I roamed'), the 153rd verse of the [[Dhammapada]] (found in the 11th chapter),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismyanmar.com/nibbana/dmpdth2a.htm |title=Words spoken by Lord Buddha on the day of Supreme Enlightenment- |author=Ashin Kundalabhivamsa |author2=Nibbana.com |accessdate=28 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013231706/http://www.thisismyanmar.com/nibbana/dmpdth2a.htm |archivedate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.11.than.html|title=Jaravagga: Aging|last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu|year=1997|work=Access to Insight|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are believed to be the first words uttered by the Buddha upon attaining [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buddhist-terms.blogspot.com/2008/07/consecration.html|title=CONSECRATION - ဗုဒ္ဓါဘိသေက|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consecration rite, which can last a few hours, is held in the morning and consists of four primary parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swearer|first=Donald K.|title=Becoming the Buddha: the ritual of image consecration in Thailand|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2004|pages=218–219|isbn=978-0-691-11435-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Recitation of ''aneka jāti saṃsāraṃ''
# Recitation of the [[Twelve Nidānas]]

The consecration rituals are believed to imbue the Buddha image with a sacred quality that can protect the home and surroundings from misfortune and symbolically embody the powers of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schober|first=Juliane|title=Sacred biography in the Buddhist traditions of South and Southeast Asia|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=2002|pages=275–276|isbn=978-81-208-1812-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian persecution complex''' is a belief, attitude or world view that Christian values and Christians are being oppressed by social groups and governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoover|2015|p=23}}: According to  Hoover Linda "''...Castelli (2007) believed the reluctance to
self-disclose could be the “Christian persecution complex” (p. 156), an ideology that Christian values are unfavorably targeted by social and governmental opposition...''"&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is thought to be held by certain American Protestant Churches&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/christians-in-the-us-are-not-persecuted-an-intersectional_us_59161b18e4b02d6199b2ef05 "Christians In The U.S. Are Not Persecuted", Huffpost, 05/12/2017]&lt;/ref&gt; and Christian- or Bible-based cults.

==Early Christianity==

According to [[Candida Moss]]{{efn|Candida Moss is the Edward Cadbury Professor of Theology at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/tr/moss-candida.aspx|title=Professor Candida Moss|website=birmingham.ac.uk|language=en|accessdate=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} the Christian "persecution complex" appeared during the era of [[early Christianity]] due to internal Christian identity politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Janes|Houen|2014|p=24}}: Indeed, a recent study by Candida Moss, ''The Myth of Persecution]]'' has suggested that Christian "persecution complex" was the result of internal christian identity politics''&lt;/ref&gt; Moss suggested that the idea of persecution is cardinal to the worldview of Christianity, noting that it creates the impression that Christians are a minority that are facing a war - even though they are numerically superior.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Årsheim|2016|p=7}}: Candida Moss has argued that the notion of persecution is all but essential to Christianity as a worldview, tracing the discursive construction of martyrdom from Antiquity and up to the present, pointing to its constitutive role for the self-understanding of Christians as embattled minorities – even while numerically superior&lt;/ref&gt; This perception is grounded in the [[Manichaeism|manichaeistic]] belief that the world is divided into two factions, one led by [[God]] and the other by [[Satan]]. In this view there can be no compromise between the two, and even attempting to dialogue or engage with "the other" is seen as a form of collaboration with it. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moss|2013|p=254}}: The myth of persecution is theologically grounded in the division of the world into two parties, one backed by [[God]] and the other by [[Satan]]...And everyone knows you cannot reason with devil. Even when devil is not explicity invoked, the rhetoric of persecution suggests that the persecutors are irrational and immoral and the persecuted are innocent and brave. In a world filled with persecution, efforts to negotiate or even reason with one's persecutors are interpreted as collaboration and moral compromise. We should not attempt to understand the other party, because to do so would be to cede ground to injustice and hatred&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Cavill{{efn| Paul Cavill is a Lecturer in Early Modern British History at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/pc504@cam.ac.uk|title=Dr Paul Cavill
|website=hist.cam.ac.uk|language=en|accessdate=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} claims that the [[New Testament|New Testament]] teaches that persecutions are inherent to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cavill|2013|p=81}}: The early christian persecution complex is often underemphasised, but is important. The New Testament teaches that persecution is the inevidable by-product of effective Christianity&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th and 21st centuries ==
Many find it difficult to define the origin of the Christian persecution complex. According to Elizabeth Castelli,{{efn| Elizabeth A. Castelli is the Ann Whitney Olin Professor of Religion at [[Barnard College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://barnard.edu/profiles/elizabeth-castelli|title=Elizabeth Castelli Barnard College|website=barnard.edu|language=en|accessdate=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castelli|2008}}: "There is no precise origin point for the contemporary discursive project of the Christian persecution complex"&lt;/ref&gt; some set the starting point in the middle of the 20th century, following a series of court rulings that declared public places to be out of bounds for religious activity (e.g. [[School prayer|morning prayer in schools]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castelli|2007|p=157}}:For those who have upped the ante by recently deciding to characterize the circumstances of Christians in the United States as the “war on Christians, the historical turning point tends to reside in the mid-twentieth century, when a series of federal and Supreme court decisions declared certain public institutions off-limits for sectarian religious activity (e.g., prayer and Bible reading in public schools). For the Christian activists who view these court decisions as opening skirmishes in the war on Christians, the decisions and the “activist judges” who promulgated them effectively—and dangerously— banned God from the public square.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it{{clarify|reason=what?|date=December 2018}} became apparent in the United States in the 1990s with the adoption of the [[International Religious Freedom Act of 1998]] as the official foreign policy. A few years later, the [[September 11 attacks]] boosted its development. This complex "mobilizes the language of [[religious persecution]] to shut down political debate and critique by characterizing any position not in alignment with this politicized version of Christianity as an example of anti-religious bigotry and persecution. Moreover, it routinely deploys the archetypal figure of the [[martyr]] as a source of unquestioned religious and political authority".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Årsheim|2016|p=7}}:According to Elizabeth Castelli, this engagement can be ascribed to a ‘Christian persecution complex’ that gathered pace throughout the 1990s, with the adoption of the US International Religious Freedom Act in 1998 as a significant milestone, and with the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 as an accelerating factor (Castelli 2007: 173). This complex ''“…mobilizes the language of [[religious persecution]] to shut down political debate and critique by characterizing any position not in alignment with this politicized version of Christianity as an example of antireligious bigotry and persecution. Moreover, it routinely deploys the archetypal figure of the martyr as a source of unquestioned religious and political authority.”'' (Castelli 2007: 154).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hostility towards Christians ==
American sociologist [[George Yancey]] finds that the perception of some Christians that they are persecuted is not unfounded, and that anti-Christian hostility is real. Yancey, in a 2017 publication, suggests that levels of anti-Christian hostility have not significantly risen over the past few decades (in the United States), however those with this hostility have gained economic power and thus "... Christian activists may be correct in that they now pay a stiffer price for that animosity.” &lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13644-017-0303-8 George Yancey, "Has Society Grown More Hostile Towards Conservative Christians? Evidence from ANES Surveys", ''Review of Religious Research'', pp 1–24, Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2017/october/anti-christian-bias-richer-evangelicals-persecution-complex.html KATE SHELLNUTT,  "Study: Anti-Christian Bias Hasn’t Grown. It’s Just Gotten Richer", ''Christianity Today'', OCTOBER 10, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian journalists point out that "American Christians have a [[persecution complex]]" while noting that the persecution of Christians is real in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.religionnews.com/2013/04/03/in-the-middle-east-not-america-christians-are-actually-persecuted/  Jonathan Merritt, "In the Middle East, not America, Christians are actually persecuted", Religion News Service, April 3, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Church and School of Wicca''' was founded by [[Gavin Frost]] and [[Yvonne Frost]] in 1968. It was the first federally recognized Church of the religion known as [[Wicca]] in the [[United States]]. It is well known for its [[correspondence courses]] on the Frosts' unique interpretation of Wicca. The Church and School are located in [[Hinton, West Virginia]].

==History==

The Church of Wicca was founded in 1968.{{sfnm|1a1=Clifton|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=Guiley|2y=2008|2p=61}} Gavin Frost was a British-born aerospace engineer.{{sfn|Clifton|2006|p=89}} While working for an aerospace company in southern England's [[Salisbury Plain]]—an area replete with prehistoric monuments—he became interested in the [[druid]]s.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=133}} His wife Yvonne was an American with a background in [[Spiritualism]].{{sfn|Clifton|2006|p=89}} He then claimed to have been initiated into a Wiccan group in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=133}} When living in St. Louis they developed a correspondence course through which to teach others about Wicca, advertising these courses as the "School of Wicca".{{Sfn|Guiley|2008|p=61}}
They argued that by spreading their religious teaching in the form of a correspondence course, they were reaching a wider range of people than initiatory-based forms of Wicca, and that this would be necessary in order for the religion to become a "strong religious force".{{sfn|Clifton|2006|p=89}} They believed strongly that Wicca should be presented publicly, believing that the secrecy observed by some Wiccan group brought mistrust and persecution from wider society.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=133}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="The people who really get in trouble are the people who are semisecret; that's how rumors start. Be public. The government will defend your right to the bitter end, because that's the way we're set up in the U.S. But if you're private and secret then people will come around and burn down your barn in the middle of the night. And then who will defend you."|source=Gavin and Yvonne Frost{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=415}} }}

The Frosts had adopted the term "Wicca" in the late 1960s, when it was gaining increasing usage within the Pagan Witchcraft community as a name for their religion.&lt;ref name="DoyleWhite193"&gt;[[#Doy10|Doyle White 2010]]. p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;
The pair resisted using the term "Pagan" until the late 1970s.{{sfn|Clifton|2006|p=89}} In 1975, Yvonne stated that "I do not consider myself a Pagan. I do not worship any nature deity. I reach upward to the unnameable which has no gender".{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=132}}

In conjunction with his lawyers, Gavin secured religious recognition for his School from the [[Internal Revenue Service]] in 1972; this resulted in his Church becoming the first recognised church of Wicca in the United States.{{sfn|Guiley|2008|p=61}} Later that year they began working on their Church and School full time.{{sfn|Guiley|2008|p=61}} Gavin appointed himself as its archbishop, and Yvonne as a bishop, and they awarded themselves [[doctorate of divinity|doctorates of divinity]] through the Church.{{sfn|Guiley|2008|p=61}} The couple moved first to [[Salem, Missouri]]—where they ran a pig farm{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=132}}—and then to [[New Bern, North Carolina]] in 1974.{{sfn|Guiley|2008|p=61}} There they tried to establish a survival community, but it failed to materialise.{{sfn|Guiley|2008|p=61}} In he late 1970s they began holding an annual "Samhain Seminar", in which workshops, rituals, and lectures took place, primarily for students of their correspondence course.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=431}} In 1996 they relocated to [[Hinton, West Virginia]].{{sfn|Guiley|2008|p=61}}

In 1985 the Church of Wicca were involved in the ''[[Dettmer v. Landon]]'' case, during which the [[District Court of Virginia]] ruled that Wicca constituted a legitimate religion under U.S. law. The Virginia prison authorities appealed the case, and in 1986 Judge J. Butzner of the [[Federal Appeals Court]] upheld the original decision.{{sfn|Guiley|2008|p=61}} This made the Church of Wicca the only federally recognised Wiccan church to have its status as a religion upheld in a federal appeals court.{{sfn|Guiley|2008|p=61}}

Within the American Wiccan and wider modern Pagan community, the Frosts have been at the centre of various disputes, particularly surrounding issues such as [[homosexuality]] and [[theology]].{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=131}} The Wiccan [[Margot Adler]] suggested that much of this controversy stemmed from Gavin's "wry and rather bizarre sense of humor, and his tendency to say anything to get a rise out of someone", something which she thought had resulted in the Frosts often being "misunderstood".{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=131}} In person, she thought, the Frosts "have always been delightful", with Gavin being "kind and humorous" and Yvonne being "forthright and even a bit prim".{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=132}}

They published a book titled ''The Witch's Bible'', which generated outrage within the Wiccan community.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=131}} Many critics referred to it as a "Witchcrap book".{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=131}} Many of the central teachings featured in the book—such as its emphasis on the existence of an asexual monotheistic deity—were at total odds with mainstream Wiccan belief.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=131}} Many Wiccans were angered at the word ''The'' as it appeared in the title, presupposing that it carried some form of authority within the Wiccan community.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=132}} Its comments on race and sex also caused controversy.{{sfn|Adler|2006|pp=131–132}}

==Belief and teaching==

The Church of Wicca defines Wicca as a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religion.{{sfn|Adler|2006|pp=96, 131}} Gavin expressed the view that there was one God, which was abstract, unknowable, and beyond the need for any worship.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=132}} This is one of the teachings which distinguishes it from other Wiccan traditions.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=133}} Unlike many other Wiccan groups, there was no particular emphasis on female divinity or the feminine, with Gavin calling beliefs about ancient matriarchies "a Marxist heresy".{{sfn|Adler|2006|pp=133, 134}}

He also expressed belief in "stone gods", "idols" which are created by humans as a storage for [[energy (esotericism)|energy]] which can then be utilised for magical purposes.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=132}}

The Church taught that the [[Ghost|astral]] realm, which they called the "Side", is structured into ten levels.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=133}} They taught that each human has a soul which undergoes a progressive system of [[reincarnation]] though which it can learn.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=134}} The Frosts' view was that [[overpopulation]] had resulted in "inferior souls" incarnating on the earth.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=134}} 

The Church taught [[kundalini]] sex practices. These included "introitus", in which sex without [[orgasm]] was held as a form of surrender to God.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=134}}

==Impact and legacy==

Tens of thousands of students have begun the School's twelve-lesson course in Wicca, although only several hundred have finished it.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=131}}
In 2006, the Wiccan journalist [[Margot Adler]] suggested that the School of Wicca may have been responsible for the formation of as many as one hundred covens.{{sfn|Adler|2006|p=131}}

==Curriculum==
The School's curriculum includes classes on a variety of subjects associated both with Wicca as a religion and with occult and metaphysical studies and practices in general. These classes begin with an "Essential [[Witchcraft]]" course, which lasts "a year and a day". Other topics include: Advanced [[Celtic_Wicca|Celtic Witchcraft]] and [[Shamanism]], [[Astral Projection|Astral Travel]], [[Astrology]], [[Graphology]], Mystical Awareness, a Natural Wicca Survey Course, Practical [[Magic (paranormal)|Sorcery]], [[Prediction]], [[Psychic]] and [[Herbalism|Herbal]] [[Healing]], and [[Tantric Yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wicca.org Church &amp; School of Wicca official website]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the course of study is available to the student on video.

==Charters==
The Church and School [[charter]]ed several other churches and groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.controverscial.com/Gavin%20and%20Yvonne%20Frost.htm Controversial.com Website]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the Church, ordination to individuals and sometimes even charters to churches had at times been offered solely on the basis of the Church's correspondence courses. However, due to a few incidents of fraudulent use of Church credentials, misconduct by these individuals, and/or the use of course material to defame the Church and the religion of Wicca, along with public controversy about these instances, this practice was abandoned as of 1976. In some cases, charters have been revoked.

The '''Commodore's Messenger Organization''' (CMO) is a sub-unit of the [[Sea Org]], a [[paramilitary]]&lt;ref&gt;Stark and Bainbridge 1996, p. 213.
*Dawson 2006, p. 38: "Members of the paramilitary Sea Org sign billion-year contracts of absolute loyalty and service to the highest leadership of the Church of Scientology."

==Formation==
The first Commodore's Messengers were appointed by  [[L. Ron Hubbard]] in 1968 while he was living aboard the [[Sea Org]]anization ship called the ''Apollo''. These messengers were his personal administrative assistants and operated solely under his direction, ensuring that [[Scientology]] management was following Hubbard’s policies.&lt;ref name="Bare-faced Messiah"&gt;{{cite book | author=Miller, Russell | authorlink=Russell Miller| title=Bare-faced Messiah, The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard | publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co | location=New York | edition=First American | year=1987 | isbn=0-8050-0654-0 | pages = 301–304 | url = http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/bfm/bfmconte.htm |chapter=18. Messengers of God | chapterurl=http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/bfm/bfm18.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original four messengers were [[Janis Gillham]] (aged 11), [[Terri Gillham]] (12), [[Annie Tildman|Annie Tidman]] (12) and [[Suzette Hubbard]] (13), who was later replaced by Claire Popham (13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology/scientology-what-happened-in-vegas-part-2-of-3-in-a-special-report-on-the/1048123|title=Scientology: What happened in Vegas, Part 2 of 3 in a special report on the Church of Scientology|work=Tampa Bay Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright Seite 164"&gt;Lawrence Wright [2013] ''Im Gefängnis des Glaubens'', S. 164, Deutsche Verlagsanstalt, {{ISBN|978-3-421-04535-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975 while sailing in the Caribbean, due to the heat and humidity, the Messengers devised their uniforms themselves: white shorts, tie tops and platform shoes with knee high socks.&lt;ref name="Wright Seite 164"/&gt;  Messengers conveyed messages from Hubbard and they were trained to mimic Hubbard's exact tone and mannerisms.

One Sea Org member recalled inquiring why Hubbard chose young girls for the role of messenger. Hubbard reported that "[[Hitler]] was a madman, but nevertheless a genius in his own right and the [[Nazi Youth]] was one of the smartest ideas he ever had. With young people you had a blank slate." &lt;ref name="cs.cmu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/miller/bfm19.htm|title=Bare-Faced Messiah: Chapter 19|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hubbard further argued that he picked girls because women were more loyal than men.'&lt;ref name="cs.cmu.edu"/&gt;

==Watchdog Committee and All Clear Unit==
In April 1979, Hubbard created the Watchdog Committee (WDC). In 1981, the All Clear Unit of the CMO was set up with the purpose of ensuring an "All Clear" for Hubbard to emerge from hiding.&lt;ref name="instinct.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instinct.org/texts/bluesky/bs6-3.htm|title=A Piece Of Blue Sky - Part 6, Chapter 3: The Young Rulers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As head of the unit, David Miscavige took orders only from [[Pat Broeker]], who was accountable only to Hubbard.&lt;ref name="instinct.org"/&gt;

Rinder left the church in 2007 and has since spoken out against it.

[[Pat Broeker]] was aboard the Apollo and, along with his wife Anne, were taking care of Hubbard at the time of his death.   An order was issued promoting Broeker and his wife to the rank of "Loyal Officer", but that order was later cancelled. 

[[Marc Yager]] joined the Sea Org in 1974 and sailed with Hubbard on ''Apollo''.  Yager became a messenger and assisted Hubbard in video production. Yager was appointed Commanding Officer of the Commodore's Messenger Organization, Chairman of the Watchdog Committee, and later, Inspector General for Administration in the Religious Technology Center (RTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdX74k8dMGgC&amp;pg=PA71|title=Blown for Good|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Declaration_Marc_Yager_1994.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-members of the Church have alleged that Yager was sent to "[[The Hole (Scientology)|The Hole]]", a [[Rehabilitation Project Force]] facility.&lt;ref name="Concentration"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/08/scientology_concentration_camp_the_hole.php|title=Scientology's Concentration Camp for Its Executives: The Prisoners, Past and Present|last=Ortega|first=Tony|date=August 2, 2012|work=The Village Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/05/30/marc-yager-and-the-ias/|title=Marc Yager and the IAS|work=Moving On Up a Little Higher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, [[David Miscavige]], then aged 16, joined the Messengers.  After Hubbard's death, Miscavige emerged as the leader of the Church of Scientology.

'''Dakshinavarti Shankh''' (''Valampuri Sanggu''; ''Sri Lakshmi Shankh''), is a sacred [[Hindu]] object otherwise known in English as a [[conch shell]]. This is the [[gastropod shell|shell]] of a large [[sea snail]] from the [[Indian Ocean]] (a shell of the species ''[[Turbinella pyrum]]''), but one that has the very rare [[sinistral coiling|reverse-turning spiral]].

In other words, when it is held with the spout (siphonal canal) pointed up, this conch's spiral twists rightwards (dakshinavarti) rather than very much more common form, which twists leftwards (vamavarti).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article on Valampuri – Weblink|url= http://www.agt-gems.com/Shells.html|accessdate=2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Article on Valampuri – Weblink|url= http://www.p-g-a.org/valampuri-artl.html|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== True vs. fake ==
[[File:An artificial rightwards triton conch.jpg|thumb|An artificial or fake right-handed [[Charonia tritonis|triton conch]]]]
The genuine Lakshmi Shank is a sinistral [[conch]] shell from the Indian Ocean, and certainly not a (superficially similar) Sinistral [[Whelk]] ([[Lightning Whelk]]) species from Florida, USA. A true Valampuri shell is a species in the gastropod genus ''[[Turbinella]]'' L. The most common species is ''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'' L. It is important to note that only the rare sinistral variety of ''Turbinella'' species is a true Lakshmi Shankh. This kind of shell is very rare in its occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sangu |first=Valampuri |title=Valampuri Sangu |url=http://www.indiaproperty365.com/vastu-tips/valampuri-sangu.html |website=IndiaProperty365 |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other right-turning sea snail shells of a similar shape, such as the lightning whelk (''[[Sinistrofulgur perversum]]''), are often mistakenly sold and worshiped in place of the genuine Shank. However, the real Lakshmi Shank has 3 to 7 ridges or plaits on its columella, whereas whelk shells does not show the presence of such plaits on its columella. The so-called "flower-bud opening test", and the "rice pulling test" (Valampuri said to rise up through a rice heap) are non scientific. The best authenticity test is to take an X-ray image of the Valampuri. Valampuries do show some morphological variation depending on origin, and shells with mixed characters of two adjacent localities are also seen.

In South India, people trust only the Rameshwaram type of Valampuries, and do not trust other varieties from West Coast and Bay of Bengal, though these are also the true Valampuries.

In South India, people specifically worship 'Gauri Valampuri'.  This Valampuri shows presence of small dark spots on its body whrol, near the conch cavity.  However, this type  of Valampuri is very rare in its occurrence and is  much expensive as compared to other types.

== Origin ==
Genuine Dakshinavarti Lakshmi Conches are only found in the Indian Ocean, between Myanmar (Burma) all the way to Sri Lanka. There are three main localities of this shankh in India. Shells from all the localities show definite morphological variations. The three localities are the Indian Ocean near Ram Setu, Sri Lanka, Ramishwaram to Tuticorin. Shells from this region are rare in occurrence. The second locality is Arabian Sea or Western India. The third locality is Bay of Bengal. Varieties showing mixed characters have also been observed. The imitation (Lightning Whelks) mostly come from Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. This imitation is also known as African Valampuri. It is also important to note that other than busyconid species, few other species showing presence of folds in the cavity are wrongly mentioned as Dakshinavarti. These species though sinistral are different species. Having folds does not mean that they are all species under the genus Turbinella Linn.

== Rarity ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Real-lakshmi-Shank1.jpg|thumb|400px]] --&gt;
There are different varieties of Valampuri shells based on their locality. The three main localities are Rameshwar, Ram Setu, Sri Lanka. The second one is West Coast of India or Arabian Sea and third one is Bay of Bengal. All the three types show variation.

Real Lakshmi Conch (right side spinning) are estimated to occur only one per 100,000 conch shells. The shell of the lightning whelk on the other hand almost always opens on the right (when viewed with the siphonal canal pointing upwards). Valampuries with five plaits or folds in its cavity are known as 'Panchajanya' and are very rare. Completely snow-white Valampuries are also very rare and expensive. Giant Valampuries more than 5&amp;nbsp;kg are extremely rare in occurrence. Valampuries more than 3 feet in length are reported.

== Powers ascribed ==
The [[Lakshmi]] Conch is said to bring all manner of blessing, but particularly material wealth, upon the owner. Ritual use may include bathing deities, drinking from the conch, or the use of [[mantra]]s oriented to goddess Lakshmi. It is a wonderful object for Vastu purpose giving high positive energy.

== Current value ==
A true Valampuri / Dakshinavarthy shell may be sold on weight basis, but at the same times it can also be sold per piece. The present market cost in India falls in the range of Rs. 1100/- to Rs. 5000/- per gram. However, there have been some reports that pure milky white Ast Laxmi shell with 8 valeys and pink lines, is also sold up to Rs. 5000/- per gram. Based upon a market search, price was average of Indian Valampuri/ Dakshinavarthy depending on size, type, quality and Ignorance of Indian Buyers price can be much higher. Tiny dwarf Valampuries / Dakshinavarthy small enough to wear as a pendant are very rare and price is negotiable when available. Tiny Valampuri / Dakshinavarthy are practically not available and people are often being cheated by selling Sinistral Land Snail in the name of Tiny Valampuri / Dakshinavarthy.

It may be noted certain cartels working in Tamil Nadu and South India are creating an artificial shortage of Valampuri / Dakshinavarti Shells and are fooling common people by charging exorbitant prices, Customers are advised to lodge a complaints against them under MRTPC (Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission) Act-1966.

Most of the sellers are also selling Lightning Welk or Busicon Contarium i.e. a shell from Florida and Bahamas, which is readily available in India for Rs. 100/- to Rs. 2000/- per piece in much much higher prices. Complains of forgery can also be initiated against them.

It is observed that many of the so-called dealers do not have the actual Valampuri / Dakshinavarthy pieces in hand. One can see pictures of the same Valampuri / Dakshinavarthy on different websites. Nobody knows, who has the actual piece available.

'''Divine Service''' is the term used in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] to describe the daily cycle of public services celebrated in the [[temple]] (church building).

The word may be used also of the [[Divine Liturgy]], though its normal connotation is the [[Daily Office]]. For Orthodox Christians, the serving of God in divine [[worship]] is an obligation of every Christian. This obligation involves both private and public worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Paradise]], divine worship consisted of freely glorifying God, which came naturally to them as a result of their unimpeded ''[[theoria]]'' ([[Vision (religion)|vision]] of God in his [[Essence-Energies distinction|Divine Energies]]).  After the [[Fall of man]], this theoria became clouded, and worship required effort on the part of man.  Now divine service was accomplished in the form of [[sacrifice|sacrificial offering]]s, [[penance]] and prayer. These sacrifices were later codified in the [[Torah|Law of Moses]]. Thence forward, only specific offerings were made, by specific persons (priests), in a specific manner, and at a specific place (eventually, the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]), and specific liturgical days and feasts were instituted. In Orthodox theology, any [[efficacy]] in these Old Testament sacrifices is dependent upon the [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|sacrifice of Christ]] on the [[Cross]].&lt;ref name="ZB"/&gt;

After the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] and [[Pentecost]], the [[Early Church]] originally continued to participate in the rites of the Jewish Temple ({{bibleverse||Acts|2:46-47|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|3:1|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|5:21|KJV}}, etc.), in addition to their own celebrations of the [[Eucharist]] and [[agape feast]]s. But after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Second Destruction of the Temple]] by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 70 AD, Christians began to develop their own distinct forms of worship. They did retain, however, some elements of Old Testament worship (chanting of the [[Psalms]], use of [[incense]], etc.) and the setting aside of specific times of the day for worship ({{bibleverse||Psalm|119:147-148|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|119:164|KJV}}).  

These periods of prayer eventually developed into seven distinct services, held (a) during the three major periods of the day (evening, morning, and noonday) and (b) during the night [[watches]].

The daily cycle begins with [[vespers]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;In accordance with Old Testament practice, the day is considered to begin in the evening (Genesis 1:5).&lt;/ref&gt; and proceeds throughout the night and day according to the following table:

The '''[[typica]]''' is used whenever the divine liturgy is not celebrated at its usual time, ''i.e.'', when there is a vesperal liturgy or no liturgy at all. On days when the liturgy may be celebrated at its usual hour, the typica follows the sixth hour (or matins, where the custom is to serve the Liturgy then) and the Epistle and Gospel readings for the day are read therein;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The typica has a certain correspondence to the [[Missa Sicca]] of the Mediaeval West.&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise, on [[aliturgical days]] or when the Liturgy is served at vespers, the Typica has a much shorter form and is served between the ninth hour and vespers.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Sokolof, p 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, there are [[Inter-Hours]] for the First, Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours. These are services of a similar structure to, but briefer than, the hours. their usage varies with local custom, but generally they are used only during the Nativity Fast, Apostles Fast, and Dormition Fast on days when the lenten alleluia replaces "God is the Lord" at matins, which may be done at the discretion of the [[ecclesiarch]] when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated.

In addition to these public prayers, there are also private prayers prescribed for both monastics and laypersons; in some monasteries, however, these are read in church. These include Morning and Evening Prayers and prayers (and, in Russia, [[canon (hymnography)|canons]]) to be prayed in preparation for receiving the [[Eucharist]].

The full cycle of services are usually served only in monasteries, cathedrals, and other [[Katholikon|Katholika]] (sobors). In monasteries and parishes of the Russian tradition, the Third and Sixth Hours are read during the [[Liturgy of Preparation|Prothesis ( Liturgy of Preparation)]]; otherwise, the Prothesis is served during matins, the final portion of which is omitted, the [[Liturgy of the Catechumens]] commencing straightway after the [[troparion]] following the [[Great Doxology]].

The [[Midnight Office]] is seldom served in parishes churches except at the [[Easter Vigil|Paschal Vigil]] as the essential office wherein the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|burial shroud]] is removed from the tomb and carried to the altar.

===Aggregates===
The sundry Canonical Hours are, in practice, grouped together into aggregates&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Sokolof, p 36&lt;/ref&gt; so that there are three major times of prayer a day: Evening, Morning and Midday.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is to conform with Psalm 55:17, "Evening, morning, and noonday will I tell of it and will declare it, and He will hear my voice."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine Liturgy===
The [[Divine Liturgy]] is not technically a part of the daily cycle of services, since theologically, the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] takes place in eternity. It is also not served daily in most parishes and smaller monasteries. However, when it is served, it is usually scheduled into the noonday aggregate.

'''Garth William Smith''' (born June 8, 1960) is a pianist/composer/musician accomplished in several styles of [[music]] including [[rock music|rock]], [[country music|country]], [[classical music|classical]] and [[jazz music|jazz]].  His current endeavor is creating spiritually uplifting [[piano]] arrangements of popular [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints hymns|LDS Hymns]].  He resides in [[Oceanside, California]] and is a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865601511/Whats-New-Sacred-Hymns-is-a-moving-CD.html?pg=all Deseret News 22-April-2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mormonmomswhoblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/beautiful-new-cd-hymns-by-garth-smith.html Mormon Moms Who Blog 04 Apr 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Life and education ==
Garth was born in [[Brigham City, Utah]], the son of a senior executive chemical engineer working at [[Thiokol]], G. Ray and JoAnne (Petty) Smith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865634109/Whats-new-How-Beautiful-Thy-Temples-brings-a-spirit-of-peace.html?pg=all Deseret News 8 Aug 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; After taking a short break to serve a mission to the [[Navajo]] people of [[Northern Arizona]], Garth completed a college degree in Design Engineering Technology from [[Brigham Young University]], graduating in the class of 1988.  Afterwards, Garth accepted a position at [[Intergraph Corporation]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. Later he moved to [[Carlsbad, California]] to accept a design position with [[Callaway Golf]].

== Music career ==

Garth began his classical musical training on the piano at the age of 5.  As a missionary and college student he would entertain many with his piano skills, including a special performance of [[Piano sonatas (Beethoven)|a Beethoven sonata]] to over 15,000 people in the BYU Marriott Center at his college graduation.

He has been a member of the [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) and the [[Nashville Songwriters Association International]]. In 1999 he was the recipient of the California Country Music Association (CCMA) "Song of the Year" award for the song "Last Call." He has also performed as a keyboardist in jazz, rock, and country bands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mormonmusic.org/mormon-artists/garth-w-smith/ MormonMusic Bio]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nashville Era ===
While living in Alabama, Garth was introduced "Writers in the Round" at the famous [[Bluebird Cafe]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], a club famous for intimate, acoustic music performed by its composers.  Soon, Garth was active participant there, performing his own original compositions.

Garth also participated as both a rehearsal and performance pianist in the local community theaters of Huntsville.  He also joined in various local bands touring throughout Northern Alabama and Southern Tennessee.  They also participated in local music festivals including Huntsville's annual [[Panoply Arts Festival]].

=== California Era ===
Relocating to [[Southern California]] in 1996, Garth continued playing in country bands, as well as developing his songwriting abilities. His bands have played at many popular venues such as the [[Viejas Casino]] and the [[San Diego County Fair]].

== LDS Hymns ==
By 2014, Garth had turned his music to creating artistic arrangements of popular [[Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book)|gospel hymns]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]], producing several albums, music videos and other related works.  His work is available through [[Deseret Book Company|Deseret Books]].
 
=== Album #1: Sacred Hymns ===
Recently Garth has turned his attention to recording original arrangements of popular LDS Hymns, releasing this first album in 2014 titled ''Sacred Hymns Arranged and Performed on the Piano''.  This has received great acclaim and wide national distribution within the LDS music genre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ldsmag.com/article-1-14272/ Meridian Magazine 27 April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Album #2: Temples ===
For his second full-length album, ''How Beautiful Thy Temples, Sacred Hymns, Vol. II'' (released in 2015), Garth brings his masterful, reverent signature style to bear on hymns and sacred songs that focus on the beauty and eternal significance of temples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldssmile.com/2015/05/07/review-of-how-beautiful-thy-temples-sacred-hymns-vol-ii-by-garth-smith/ LDS SMILE 07 May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; This has been his most successful release yet, having charted nationally at #21 on the iTunes Gospel new music chart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ldsmissionaries.com/sacred-hymns-for-missionaries-inspiring-piano-music-by-garth-smith/ Sacred Hymns for LDS Missionaries 27 Aug 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Crawford Gates]], famous LDS composer, has called "How Beautiful Thy Temples" a "fabulous recording." Smith's arrangement of Gates' beloved Easter hymn "He is Not Here" (from "The Choirbook") is included as track 8 on the album.

From "An Angel From on High," an arrangement inspired by the statue of the Angel Moroni that sits atop many temples, to the children's songbook classic "I Love To See the Temple". It's the perfect music to set the tone around your home on the Sabbath or to invite the Spirit more fully into your life day-to-day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ldsmissionaries.com/sacred-hymns-for-missionaries-inspiring-piano-music-by-garth-smith/ Sacred Hymns for LDS Missionaries 27 Aug 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Album #3: Great Redeemer ===
On 01-Sept-2016, Garth released his third album of [[Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book)|LDS Hymn arrangements]], a collection of fresh, new arrangements of about the Saviour, [[Jesus Christ]], titled ''Behold the Great Redeemer, Sacred Hymns, Vol. III.''  A new addition is the release of his original sheet music so that now other experienced pianists can perform this genre music in church worship services and other religious settings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldsliving.com/LDS-Pianist-Garth-Smith-Releases-Christ-Centered-Album/s/83007 LDSLiving.com Behold the Great Redeemer]&lt;/ref&gt;   Selections include ''[[Lead, Kindly Light]],'' ''In Humility our Saviour,'' and another [[Crawford Gates]] masterpiece, ''Our Saviour's Love''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The bottom line is this—Smith’s music takes you to a place of serenity, an escape from the world for a moment, and provides the listener with beautiful arrangements that point to the Savior."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Album #4: A Sacred Christmas ===
Released in time for the 2017 [[Christmas| Christmas season]], ''A Sacred Christmas'', this album features a variety of his favorite hymns that commemorate the birth of the Saviour.  This album features several guest artists, Calee Reed, Michael Dowdle, [[One Voice Children's Choir]], Sun Valley Carolers and others that add an extra layer of inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mormonmusic.org/mormon-artists/garth-w-smith Mormon Music]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music Firesides ===
He frequently travels the country performing free, inspirational [[Fireside (LDS Church)|music firesides]].  His 60 minute presentation explores gospel principles found in 8 hymns that includes [[Restorationism|the restoration]], [[prayer]], [[sacrament]], [[forgiveness]], and most importantly, the [[atonement]] of Jesus Christ.

The multimedia presentation features a Christ-centered narrative, live piano, video clips from prophets and apostles, and artwork from other LDS artists.

=== Gospel Music Videos ===
Garth's piano is a backdrop featured in many gospel music videos produced directly by or for the LDS Church, including the church's recent [[#LIGHTtheWORLD]] Christmas season service message. The most popular of these videos is the [[Heaven's Hallelujah]] arrangement featuring vocalist [[Lauren Sullivan]]. Many of these are accessible for free on their [[YouTube Channel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3396">'''Gwilherm Berthou''' (10 May 1908, [[Paimpol]] – 14 March 1951, [[Rennes]]) was a [[Breton nationalist]] and neo-Druidic bardic poet.  He was a member of the Breton artistic movement [[Seiz Breur]]. 

==Terrorism==
Berthou was born in [[Paimpol]], [[Côtes-d'Armor]]. He trained as a chemical engineer, then worked full-time as a pharmacist at Guipavas. In 1929 he suggested to fellow chemist and Breton nationalist [[Célestin Lainé]] that a militant group dedicated to [[direct action]] against the French state and its symbols should be formed. This was to be called ''Kentoc'h Mervel'' (Rather Death). As Lainé sought his own recruits, Berthou brought the staff of the nationalist journal [[Breiz da Zont]] to join ''en masse''. When Lainé discovered this he distanced himself from Berthou, believing that a public journal could not create an effective support for a secret organization, as it would be too easily infiltrated. Lainé went on to form the terrorist faction ''[[Gwenn ha du (terrorism)|Gwenn ha du]]''. Lainé later wrote "I don't know what became of Kentoc'h Mervel after that, except that it never grew beyond fancy words."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol4/4_1/index.html Daniel Leach, "Bezen Perrot: The Breton nationalist unit of the SS, 1943-5", e-Keltoi]&lt;/ref&gt;

However when ''Gwenn ha du'' launched their first attack in 1932, bombing a sculpture, four informants  claimed that Berthou had provided the nitroglycerin.&lt;ref&gt;Ronan Carléon, ''Gwenn ha Du'', 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Druidism==
Berthou became closely associated with [[neo-Druid]]ic and [[Pan-Celticism|Celticist]] movements, writing poetry in the [[Breton language]]. As part of the [[Aryanism|Aryanist]] ideologies of the era, he studied the links between ancient Celtic (Brythonic and Gaelic) culture and [[Hinduism]]. His esoterism linked him with various Masonic and Aryanist groups. Along with [[Morvan Marchal]] and others he participated in the [[Kredenn Geltiek]] (Celtic Creed) Druidic group, adopting the bardic name '''Kerverziou''', though also using the pseudonym "Iaktimagos Vissurix". He contributed to the Celticist journals ''[[Gwalarn]]'' and ''Kad''. He also founded the periodical ''Ogam'' and was president of ''Les Amis de la Tradition Celtique'' (Friends of the Celtic Tradition).

In his metaphysical poetry written in "ancient Gallic", he predicted the end of the "white race" in the year 2018, a date which corresponded to 3888 in his own personal calendar, which he created based on the cycles of the moon and sun, starting with the supposed date of the legendary Irish  [[Cath Maige Tuired|Battle of Mag Tuired]].

==Collaborationism==
Berthou's mystical Aryanist ideas were closely linked to aspects of Nazi ideology. He contributed to the openly pro-Nazi review ''Stur'', edited by [[Olier Mordrel]], and also contributed to other pro-Nazi periodicals. During the war he was involved with the ''Institut Celtique'', created by the Occupation government. Nevertheless, Berthou's involvement remained purely literary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3005">'''Herbert Martin James Loewe''' (1882–1940) was a noted scholar of Semitic languages and Jewish culture. His grandfather, [[Louis Loewe]] (1809–1880),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurrein.com/louis%20loewe.htm Jewish Encyclopedia, Edition 1903: Dr Louis LOEWE]&lt;/ref&gt; had been Sir [[Moses Montefiore]]’s secretary and the first Principal of the [[Judith Montefiore|Judith, Lady Montefiore]] College at [[Ramsgate]].

==Biography==
Loewe was a graduate of [[Queens' College, Cambridge]].  He was Chief English Master at the Schools of the Alliance at Cairo and Abyassiyyeh, Egypt, and the author of ''Kitab el Ansab of Samani''. Loewe was a lecturer in Semitic languages at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], from 1913 until 1931 when he accepted an academic position at Cambridge. Just before he left Oxford, he was responsible for the installation of three tablets in honour of Oxford Jewish heritage. The tablets celebrate the Centenary of the birth of Neubauer, who was a noted Jewish librarian in the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jtrails.org.uk/trails/oxford/profiles/c-302/herbert-loewe&lt;/ref&gt; Loewe was Curator of Oriental Literature, University LIbrary, Cambridge, and Reader in Rabbinics, Cambridge, from 1931 to his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hebrew Manuscripts at Cambridge University Library|author1=Reif, Stefan C. |author2=Reif, Shulamit |year=1997|page=33|isbn=0-521-58339-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0-521-58339-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1939-1940 Loewe was president of the [[Society for Old Testament Study]].

Loewe's first son, Raphael Loewe (1919&amp;ndash;2011) was a scholar of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and a professor at [[University College London]], while his second son [[Michael Loewe]] is a noted scholar of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] who taught at [[Cambridge University]].

==Loewe Collection==
The [[Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies]] has in its library a collection of approximately 5,000 items collected by Herbert Loewe and his elder son Raphael Loewe (b. 1919, d. 27 May 2011), professor of Hebrew at University College London. The collection contains correspondence, offprints, unpublished typescripts of translations of Hebrew poetry, and a wide variety of printed matter related to Jewish studies in late antiquity and medieval times, as well as modern Anglo-Jewish history. There are a few items connected with Louis Loewe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/loewe.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315100643/http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/loewe.html |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Kehuna and Kohanim}}
The '''holy anointing oil''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: שמן המשחה ''shemen ha-mishchah'', "oil of anointing") formed an integral part of the ordination of the [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)|priesthood]] and the [[High Priest (Judaism)|High Priest]] as well as in the consecration of the articles of the [[Tabernacle]] ({{Bibleref2|Exodus 30:26}}) and subsequent [[Temple in Jerusalem|temples in Jerusalem]]. The primary purpose of [[anointing]] with the holy anointing oil was to sanctify, to set the anointed person or object apart as ''[[Q-D-Š|qodesh]]'', or "holy" ({{Bibleref2|Exodus 30:29}}).

Originally, the oil was used exclusively for the priests and the Tabernacle articles, but its use was later extended to include [[prophet]]s and [[king]]s ({{Bibleref2|I Samuel 10:1}}). It was forbidden to be used on an outsider ({{Bibleref2|Exodus 30:33}}) or to be used on the body of any common person ({{Bibleref2|Ex. 30:32a}}) and the [[Israelites]] were forbidden to duplicate any like it for themselves ({{Bibleref2|Ex. 30:32b}}).

[[Christianity]] has continued the practice of using holy anointing oil as a devotional practice, as well as in various liturgies.&lt;ref name="Schaff"&gt;{{cite book |last= Schaff |first= Philip |title= History of the Christian Church, Volume III: Nicene and Post-Nicene Christianity. A.D. 311-600. |date= July 1889 |publisher= Christian Classics Ethereal Library |isbn= 9781610250429 |page= 1117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hebrew Bible ==
The holy anointing oil described in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|30:22-25|HE}} was created from:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2030:23-25&amp;version=KJV |title=Exodus 30:23-25 - Passage Lookup - King James Version |publisher=BibleGateway.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the Bible, by Adam Clarke&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sweet [[cinnamon]] (קינמון בשם ''kinnemon besem'') 250 shekels (about 3&amp;nbsp;kg)

The Bible teaches us about the use of holy anointing oil as a symbol of GOD’s ability to bring about a number of essentials for our wellbeing and salvation, including healing (Mark 6:13), consecration (Exodus 30; Leviticus 8:10-13), breaking bonds (Isaiah 10:27) and deliverance (Mark 6:12-13), to name a few.

===Origin of the term===
The Hebrew term "[[Messiah]]" (in Greek ''[[wikt:Χριστός|Christos]]'') means "the anointed one", and relates to anyone anointed (dedicated to God). The person thus anointed might be a king, a priest, or a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does Messiah mean?|url=http://www.gotquestions.org/what-does-Messiah-mean.html|website=gotquestions|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strong's Exhaustive Concordance|url=http://biblehub.com/hebrew/4899.htm|website=biblehub|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the ancient Near East===
Customs varied in the cultures of the Middle East. However, [[Anointing with oil|anointing with special oil]] in Israel was either a strictly priestly or kingly right. When a prophet was anointed, it was because he was first a priest. When a non-king was anointed, such as Elijah's anointing of [[Hazael]] and [[Jehu]], it was a sign that Hazael was to become king of Aram (Syria) and Jehu was to become king of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland De Vaux]] ''Les institutions de I 'ancien testament'' (Paris: [[Éditions du Cerf|Cerf]], 1958); English 1965 - rep. Ancient Israel: its life and institutions - Page 104 1997 "Was anointing, in Israel, a strictly royal rite? In IK 19: 15-16 God commands Elias to go and anoint Hazael, Jehu . . . and Eliseus. Hazael was to be king of Syria, Jehu would be anointed king of Israel by a disciple of Eliseus, ."&lt;/ref&gt; Extra-biblical sources show that it was common to anoint kings in many [[ancient Near East]]ern monarchies. Therefore, in Israel, anointing was not only a [[sacred]] act but also a [[socio-political]] one.&lt;ref&gt;''King, cult, and calendar in ancient Israel: collected studies'' Page 36 ed. Shemaryahu Talmon - 1986 "Extra-biblical sources show that the practise of anointing kings was common to many ancient Near-Eastern monarchies ... that in Israel anointing was not a purely sacred act but also a socio-political one"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Hebrew Bible, the Israelite way of life and cultural environment put great importance on the sense of smell for survival and was highly esteemed. It contributed to the ability of man to orient himself and to find his way in a world where life and death were permanently struggling. Where stench arose, he diagnosed the presence of disease, decay, rotting processes and death (Exodus 7:18)&lt;ref&gt;On the Function of the Holy Incense (Exodus XXX 34-8) and the Sacred Anointing Oil (Exodus XXX 22-33) C Houtman - Vetus Testamentum, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and where pleasant aromas existed were places biologically clean and conducive to habitation and/or food production and harvesting. Spices and oils were chosen which assisted man in orienting himself and in creating a sense of safety as well as a sense of elevation above the physical world of decay. The sense of smell was also considered highly esteemed by deity. In Deuteronomy 4:28 and Psalms 115:5-6 the sense of smell is included in connection with the polemics against idols. In the Hebrew Bible God takes pleasure in inhaling the "soothing odor" (''reah hannihoah'') of offerings (Genesis 8:21 etc.).&lt;ref&gt;M.C.A. Korpel, A Rift in the Clouds, Ugaritic and Hebrew Descriptions of the Divine (Munster, 1990), pp. 99,105, 142, 419.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the ancient Israelite there was no oil or fat with more symbolic meaning than olive oil. It was used as an emollient, a fuel for lighting lamps, for nutrition, and for many other purposes. It was scented olive oil that was chosen to be a holy anointing oil for the [[Israelites]].

==Continuity==
Some{{who|date=January 2014}} believe in the continuity factor relative to the holy anointing oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reporter.am/go/article/2008-09-23-the-blessing-of-the-muron-behind-the-ritual |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005081009/http://www.reporter.am/go/article/2008-09-23-the-blessing-of-the-muron-behind-the-ritual |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Nyree, The Blessing of the Muron:Behind the Ritual&lt;/ref&gt;
Customs utilizing the continuity factor is found in many of the world’s religions. For example, early Jewish rabbis stressed the importance of the succession of classical semikhah&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Hal M. From sanctuary to boardroom: A Jewish approach to leadership. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Pub Incorporated, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Catholic Church emphasized the importance of apostolic succession, the continuity of laying on of hands for ordination, in an unbroken chain.&lt;ref&gt;Molland, Einar. "Irenaeus of Lugdunum and the Apostolic Succession." Journal of (1950).&lt;/ref&gt; The continuity factor relative to the holy anointing oil can be found in rabbinical judaism,&lt;ref name="Frand"&gt;Frand, Rabbi Yissocher, On Parshas Ki Sisa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="torah"&gt;http://www.torah.org/learning/ravfrand/5765/kisisa.html&lt;/ref&gt; in the Armenian Church,&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Nyree, The Blessing of the Muron: Behind the Ritual&lt;/ref&gt; in the Assyrian Church of the East&lt;ref&gt;Jenner, H. (1912). East Syrian Rite. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14413a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in the Coptic Church,&lt;ref&gt;Khs-Burmester, Oswald Hugh Ewart.

===In Rabbinic Judaism===
As mentioned above, the continuity factor can be found in [[Rabbinic Judaism]], including that of the holy anointing oil.&lt;ref name="Frand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="torah" /&gt;

One Jewish tradition teaches that the ashes of the last red heifer sacrificed were always mixed with the ashes of each new red heifer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escapeallthesethings.com/red-heifer.htm Escapeallthesethings.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple Institute states, "Some opinions maintain that the newer ashes were always mixed together with a combination of the previous ashes. One way of understanding this, is to the view this mixture of old and new ashes as being yet another precautionary measure... Additionally, mixing in the newer ashes we have produced now with those from olden times is a way of connecting through time with the original heifer that was slaughtered and prepared by Moses. As such, in a sense, it is a way of connecting with the level of Moses himself."&lt;ref&gt;The Red Heifer, The Original Ashes, The Temple Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.templeinstitute.org/red_heifer/original_ashes.htm Templeinstitute.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the last succession of ashes &lt;ref&gt;Pharisees and the Sadducees: Rethinking Their Respective Outlooks on Jewish Law, GR Knight - BYU L.

There is a traditional Jewish ''[[mitzvah]]'' that when making ''[[challah]]'' one should separate and set aside part of the dough. Some Jewish people remove a small piece of the ''challah'' dough (the word "challah" means to remove) and give it away to someone else as a challah starter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chewonthatblog.com/2009/06/02/how-to-make-challah/ Chewonthatblog.com]&lt;/ref&gt; although according to traditional Jewish law, this piece may not be eaten under any modern day conditions, and must thus be destroyed in a dignified manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aish.com/sh/r/Challah.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In one Jewish custom a portion of the ''challah'' is set aside (refrigerated) until the making of new ''challah'' when the old is added to the new. It is recorded in Exodus 30:31 "And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations." (Exodus 30:31). Commenting on this verse Rashi quotes a teaching of the Sages [Horiyos 11b] that the original Shemen HaMishcha that Moses made, to anoint the priesthood and the tabernacle furnishings, would remain intact in its entirety into the distant future (''l'asid lavoh''). When the Temple was to be rebuilt they would then need that very same holy anointing oil to anoint the priests prior to their service in the Third Temple as well as to anoint the furnishings of the mishkan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torah.org/learning/ravfrand/5765/kisisa.html Torah.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Vendyl Jones claimed that such a small quantity of oil (around a gallon) would not last that long. It is claimed that one juglet of oil lasted over 800 years.&lt;ref&gt;Jones,ThD, Professor Vendyl, Researcher 17, March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this discrepancy it is claimed that one of two things occurred: Either the container of holy anointing oil miraculously multiplied when supply became low (as did the {{Not a typo|cruse}} of oil mentioned in the story of Elijah and the widow woman&lt;ref&gt;I Kings 17:12-16&lt;/ref&gt; or the oil that lasted for eight days without being consumed during the Jewish Chanukka)&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, Solomon. "Hanukkah: Its Origin and Its Significance." The Jewish Quarterly Review (1938): 1-36&lt;/ref&gt; or, following ancient customs, new oil was added to the old thus continuing the original oil for all time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historykb.com/Uwe/Forum.aspx/history/9593/Shemen-HaMishcha-The-Holy-Anointing-Oil#d815695077efbuwe&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Christianity===
{{further|Anointing of the Sick|Chrism}}
Anointing oil is used in Christianity. A passage in the New Testament says,
{{quote| "Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.
 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord."|James 5:13,14 (KJV)}}

====In the Armenian Church====
The holy anointing oil of the Armenian Church is called the holy muron ('muron' means [[myrrh]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tchilingirian, Hratch. "The Armenian Church."&lt;/ref&gt; The church holds a special reverence for the continuity factor of the oil.&lt;ref&gt;Sahagun, Louis, The Los Angeles Times, 10/11/2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/11/local/me-beliefs11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrahamian"&gt;Abrahamian, Nyree, The blessing of the Muron: Behind the ritual
&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, a portion of the holy anointing oil of Exodus 30, which Moses and Aaron had blessed, still remained in Jesus' time. Jesus Christ blessed this oil and then gave some of it to Thaddeus, who took the holy oil to Armenia and healed King Abkar of a terrible skin disease by anointing him with the holy oil. Saint Thaddeus is said to have buried a bottle of the holy anointing oil in Daron under an evergreen tree. Saint Gregory the Illuminator discovered the hidden treasure and mixed it with muron that he had blessed. It is said that "To this day, whenever a new batch of muron is prepared and blessed, a few drops of the old one go into it, so that the Armenian muron always contains a small amount of the original oil blessed by Moses, Jesus Christ, and Gregory the Illuminator."&lt;ref name="Abrahamian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reporter.am/go/article/2008-09-23-the-blessing-of-the-muron-behind-the-ritual Reporter.am] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005081009/http://www.reporter.am/go/article/2008-09-23-the-blessing-of-the-muron-behind-the-ritual |date=5 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The holy muron is composed of olive oil and forty-eight aromas and flowers. The remaining portion of the previous blessed holy oil is poured into the newly prepared oil during the blessing ceremony and passes the blessing from generation to generation. It is said that this very procedure has been followed for nearly 1700 years. The Catholicos of all Armenians in Etchmiadzin combines a new mixture of holy muron in the cauldron every seven years using a portion of the holy muron from the previous blend. This is distributed to all of the Armenian churches throughout the world. Before Christianity, muron was reserved solely for the enthroning of royalty and for very special events. In later years, it was used with extreme unction and to heal the sick, and to anoint ordained clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Armenian Heritage, The Blessing of the Holy Muron&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the Assyrian Church of the East====
It is said by the Assyrian Church that the holy anointing oil "was given and handed down to us by our holy fathers Mar Addai and Mar Mari and Mar Tuma." The holy anointing oil of the Assyrian Church is variously referred to as the Oil of the Holy Horn, the Oil of the Qarna, or the Oil of Unction. This holy oil is an apostolic tradition, believed to have originated from the oil consecrated by the apostles themselves, and which by succession has been handed down in the Church to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic ecycl&lt;/ref&gt; The original oil which the disciples blessed began to run low and more oil was added to it. The Assyrian Church believes that this has continued to this very day with new oil being added as the oil level lowers. This succession of holy oil is believed to be a continuity of the blessings placed upon the oil from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;*{{CathEncy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14413a.htm|title=East Syrian Rite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Oil of Unction and the [[Holy Leaven]] are referred to as "leaven" although there is no actual leavening agent, so the nomenclature Holy Leaven seems to be a bit misleading. Yohanan bar Abgareh referred to it in 905 as did Shlemon d-Basra in the 13th century. Yohanan bar Zo’bee in the 14th century integrated the Holy Oil of unction with baptism and other rites. Isaaq Eshbadhnaya in the 15th century wrote the Scholion which is a commentary on specific theological topics. It tells us that John the Baptist gave John the Evangelist a baptismal vessel of water from Christ’s baptism, which was collected by John the Baptist from water dripping from Christ after his baptism in Jordan River. Jesus gave each disciple a "loaf," at the Last Supper, but the Scholion informs us that to John he gave two with the instructions to eat only one and to save the other. At the crucifixion John collected the water from the Lord's side in the vessel and the blood he collected on the loaf from the Last Supper. After the descent of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost the disciples took the vessel and mixed it with oil and each took a horn of it. The loaf they ground up and added flour and salt to it. Each took a portion of the holy oil and the holy bread which were distributed in every land by the hand of those who missionized there.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean &amp; Browne, The Catholicos of the East and his People, Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1892. pages 247 &amp; 248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East, Commission on Inter-Church Relations and Education Development, Fifth Pro Oriente Non-official Consultation on Dialogue within the Churches of the Syriac Tradition: "Sacraments in the Syriac Tradition — Part II", 26 February to 1 March 2002; Vienna (Austria), The Sacrament of the Holy Leaven "Malka" and the Holy Oil&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assyrian Church has two types of holy oils; the one is ordinary olive oil, blessed or not blessed, the other is the oil of the Holy Horn which is believed to have been handed down from the apostles. The Holy Horn is constantly renewed by the addition of oil blessed by a bishop on Maundy Thursday. While most anyone can by tradition be anointed with the regular oil, the oil of the Holy Horn is restricted for ordination and sanctification purposes.

====In the Coptic Church====
The holy anointing oil of the Coptic Church is referred to as the holy myron ('myron' means [[myrrh]]). The [[Christian laying on of hands|laying on of hands]] for the dwelling of the Holy Spirit is believed to have been a specific rite of the apostles and their successors the bishops, and as the regions of mission increased, consequently numbers of Christian believers and converts increased. It was not possible for the apostles to wander through all the countries and cities to lay hands on all of those baptized, so they established anointment by the holy myron as an alternative, it is believed, for the laying on of the hands for the Holy Spirit’s indwelling.

The first who made the myron were the apostles who had kept the fragrant oils which were on the body of Jesus Christ during his burial, and they added the spices which were brought by those women who prepared them to anoint Christ, but had discovered he had been resurrected. They melted all these spices in pure olive oil, prayed on it in the upper room in Zion, and made it a holy anointing oil. They decided that their successors, the bishops, must renew the making of the myron whenever it is nearly used up, by incorporating the original oil with the new. Today the Coptic Church uses it for ordination, in the sanctification of baptismal water, and in the consecration of churches and church altars and vessels.

It is said that when St. Mark went to Alexandria, he took with him some of the holy myron oil made by the apostles and that he used it in the sacrament of [[Chrism]], as did the patriarchs who succeeded him. This continued until the era of [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius the Apostolic]], the 20th patriarch, who then decided to remake the myron in Alexandria. Hence, it is reported, he prepared all of the needed perfumes and spices, with pure olive oil, from which God ordered Moses to make the holy anointing oil as specified in the recipe in the thirtieth chapter of the book of Exodus. Then the sanctification of the holy myron was fulfilled in Alexandria, and Athanasius was entrusted with the holy oil, which contained spices which touched Jesus’s body while it was in the tomb, as well as the original oil which had been prepared by the apostles and brought to Egypt by St. Mark. He distributed the oil to the churches abroad: to the See of Rome, Antioch and Constantinople, together with a document of its authenticity, and all of the patriarchs are said to have rejoiced in receiving it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/thecopticchurch/sacraments/2_confirmation.html Copticchurch.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coptic Church informs that the fathers of the Church and scholars like St. Justin Martyr, Tertullian, St. Hippolytus, Origen, St. Ambrose, and St. Cyril of Jerusalem, spoke about the holy myron and how they received its use in anointing by tradition. For example, St. Hippolytus in his Apostolic Tradition, speaks of the holy oil "according to ancient custom" &lt;ref&gt;quoted in Berardino, Encyclopedia of the Early Church, v. 1, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Origen writes about the holy oil “according to the tradition of the church" &lt;ref&gt;in Rom. Comm. V, 8; quoted in Berardino, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; St. Cyril of Jerusalem goes into further detail in speaking about the grace of the Holy Spirit in the holy myron: "this oil is not just any oil: after the epiclesis of the Spirit, it becomes charism of Christ and power of the Holy Spirit through the presence of the deity" &lt;ref&gt;Cat. 21, 3; quoted in Berardino, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early fathers and scholars mention the use of the holy myron, as well as a documentation by Abu'l-Barakat Ibn Kabar, a 14th-century Coptic priest and scholar, in his book Misbah az-Zulmah fi idah al-khidmah (The Lamp of Darkness in Clarifying the Service). According to his account, the holy apostles took from the spices that were used to anoint the body of Jesus Christ when he was buried,&lt;ref&gt;cf. John 19:38-40&lt;/ref&gt; added pure olive oil to it, and prayed over it in Upper Zion, the first church where the Holy Spirit fell in the upper room.

This holy oil was then distributed among all of the apostles so that wherever they preached, new converts would be anointed with it as a seal. They also commanded that whenever a new batch of Holy Myron was made, they add to it the old holy myron to keep the first holy myron continually with all that would ever be made afterwards.

According to the available resources, the holy myron in the Church of Egypt has been made 34 times.

====Among the Saint Thomas Christians and Nasranis====
According to tradition, [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] laid the original foundation for [[Christianity in India]]. It is reported that [[Judaism in India|Jewish communities already present in India]] enticed Thomas to make his missionary journey there. It is said that he brought holy [[anointing]] oil with him and that the [[St. Thomas Christians]] still have this oil to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://malankaraorthodoxchurch.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=223 Malankarorthodoxchurch.in]&lt;/ref&gt;

Patriarch Ya`qub, of the Syrian Malabar Nasrani Church, is remembered for his celebration of the [[Liturgy, Christian|liturgy]] and his humble encouragement to accept the simple way of life. After he consecrated sacred [[chrism|myron]] in the [[Mor Gabriel monastery]] in 1964, holy myron flowed from the glass container the following day and many people were said to have been healed by it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sor.cua.edu/Personage/PYacqub3/ Syriac Orthodox Resources]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification of ''kaneh bosem''==
While sources agree about the identity of four of the five ingredients of anointing oil, the identity of the fifth, "kaneh bosem", has been a matter of debate. The Bible indicates that it was an aromatic cane or grass, which was imported from a distant land by way of the spice routes, and that a related plant grows naturally in Israel.&lt;ref name="BotterweckRinggren2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=G.

===Acorus calamus===
Most lexicographers, botanists, and biblical commentators translate ''keneh bosem'' as "cane balsam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scripturetext.com/exodus/30-23.htm |title=Exodus 30:23 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels |publisher=Scripturetext.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plants of the Bible - Page 40 Harold Norman Moldenke, Alma Lance Moldenke - 1952 "The Hebrew word involved is "keneh" (Ezekiel 27 : 19 ; Song 4 : 14) or, more fully, "keneh bosem", meaning "spiced or sweet cane" (Exodus 30: 23) or "keneh hattob" or "v'kaneh hatov", meaning "and the good cane" (Jeremiah 6: 20)."&lt;/ref&gt; The Aramaic [[Targum|Targum Onkelos]] renders the Hebrew ''kaneh bosem'' in Aramaic as ''q'nei busma''.&lt;ref&gt;Vernunft und alle Sinne: ine theologisch-ästhetische Betrachtung ... - Page 122 Klaus Röhring - 2007 "Die creme- und rosafarbenen Blüten mischen sich auch farblich in dieses duftende Bouquet, sodass die Augen mitriechen können und sollen. Kalmus wird als fünfte der Pflanzen und Düfte genannt, hebräisch »keneh bosem«, Balsamschilf, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient translations and sources identify this with the plant variously referred to as sweet cane, or sweet flag (nl. the [[Septuagint]], the [[Rambam]] on [[Kerithoth]] 1:1, [[Saadia Gaon]] and [[Jonah ibn Janah]]). This plant is known to botanists as ''[[acorus calamus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.ort.org/books/torahd5.asp?action=displayid&amp;id=2403 |title=Ki Tisa |publisher=Bible.ort.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aryeh Kaplan]] in ''[[The Living Torah]]'', "It appears that a similar species grew in the Holy Land, in the Hula region in ancient times (Theophrastus, ''History of Plants'' 9:7)."&lt;ref name = "kap"/&gt;

===Cymbopogon===
[[Maimonides]] (''Yad, Kley HaMikdash'' 1:3), in contrast, indicates that it was the Indian plant, rosha grass (''[[Cymbopogon martinii]]''), which resembles red straw. Many standard reference works on Bible plants by [[Michael Zohary]] (University of Jerusalem, Cambridge, 1985), [[James A. Duke]] (2010), and [[Hans Arne Jensen]] (Danish 2004, English translation 2012) support this conclusion, arguing that the plant was a variety of [[Cymbopogon]]. James A. Duke, quoting Zohary, notes that it is "hopeless to speculate" about the exact species, but that ''[[Cymbopogon citratus]]'' (Indian lemon-grass) and ''[[Cymbopogon schoenanthus]]'' are also possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Duke, James, ''Duke's Handbook of Medicinal Plants of the Bible'', CRC Press, 2010, p.170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Allen &amp; Beck, A, ''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'', Eerdmans, 2000, p.1259.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan follows Maimonides in identifying it as the ''Cymbopogon martinii'' or palmarosa plant.&lt;ref name = "kap"&gt;[[Aryeh Kaplan|Kaplan, Aryeh]]. ''[[The Living Torah]]'' New York 1981. p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ספר העבודה - Volume 8,Numéro 1 - Page 136 Moses Maimonides - 2007 "One who willfully prepares anointing oil in this manner and with these measurements without adding or reducing [the quantity of the herbs] ... In his Living Torah, Rav Aryeh Kaplan identifies this as the ''Cymbopogon martinii'' or palmarosa plant."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cannabis, and others ===
Other possible identifications have also been made. [[Sula Benet]] in ''Early Diffusion and Folk Uses of Hemp'' (1967), identified it as ''[[cannabis]]''.&lt;ref name="xn--4dbcyzi5a.com"&gt;Sula Benet, ''[http://www.xn--4dbcyzi5a.com/wp-content/PDF/EARLY-DIFFUSION-AND-FOLK-USES-OF-HEMP-SULA-BENET.pdf Early Diffusion and Folk Uses of Hemp]'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aryeh Kaplan|Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan]] notes that "On the basis of cognate pronunciation and Septuagint readings, some identify Keneh bosem with the English and Greek ''cannabis'', the hemp plant. There are, however, some authorities who identify the 'sweet cane' with cinnamon bark (Radak, Sherashim). Some say that kinman is the wood, and keneh bosem is the bark (Abarbanel)." &lt;ref&gt;[[Aryeh Kaplan|Kaplan, Aryeh]]. ''[[The Living Torah]]'' New York 1981.p. 442..&lt;/ref&gt; Benet in contrast argued that equating Keneh Bosem with sweet cane could be traced to a mistranslation in the  [[Septuagint]], which mistook Keneh Bosem, later referred to as "cannabos" in the Talmud, as "kalabos", a common Egyptian marsh cane plant.&lt;ref name="xn--4dbcyzi5a.com"/&gt;

'''Human rights complaints against ''Maclean's'' magazine''' were filed in December 2007 by Mohamed Elmasry of the [[Canadian Islamic Congress]] with the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission]], the [[British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal]] and the [[Ontario Human Rights Commission]]. ''[[Maclean's Magazine|Maclean's]]'' magazine was accused of publishing eighteen [[Islamophobia|Islamophobic]] articles between January 2005 and July 2007. The articles  in question included a column by [[Mark Steyn]] titled "The Future Belongs to Islam",&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/the-future-belongs-to-islam/|title=The future belongs to Islam|last=Steyn|first=Mark|work=Maclean's|date=October 20, 2006|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}

&lt;/ref&gt; an excerpt from a book written by Steyn.

The Ontario Human Rights Commission ruled that it did not have the jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal heard the complaint in June 2008 and issued a ruling on October 10, 2008 dismissing the complaint. The Canadian Human Rights Commission dismissed the federal complaint on June 26, 2008 without referring the matter to a tribunal.&lt;ref name=dismiss&gt;
Komarnicki, Jamie, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080627.NATS27-2/TPStory/National "Rights panel rejects action against Maclean's"], ''The Globe and Mail'', June 27, 2008 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian Human Rights Commission==
The federal [[Canadian Human Rights Commission]] (CHRC) dismissed the [[Canadian Islamic Congress]] (CIC)'s complaint against ''[[Maclean's]]'' in June 2008. The CHRC's ruling said of the article that, "the writing is polemical, colourful and emphatic, and was obviously calculated to excite discussion and even offend certain readers, Muslim and non-Muslim alike." However, the Commission ruled that overall, "the views expressed in the Steyn article, when considered as a whole and in context, are not of an extreme nature, as defined by the Supreme Court."&lt;ref name =cp28&gt;[http://macleans.ca/canada/wire/article.jsp?content=n062808A "Canadian Human Rights Commission dismisses camplaint against Macleans"], ''Canadian Press'', June 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Faisal Joseph]], lawyer for the [[Canadian Islamic Congress]] (CIC), responded to the decision by saying that the CIC is disappointed the tribunal made its decision without hearing "the compelling evidence of hate and expert testimony"  presented in the CIC's complaint to the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal.&lt;ref name=cp28/&gt;

''[[Maclean's]]'' greeted the CHRC's decision stating that it "is in keeping with our long-standing position that the article in question, 'The Future Belongs to Islam,' an excerpt from [[Mark Steyn]]'s best-selling book America Alone, was a worthy piece of commentary on important geopolitical issues, entirely within the bounds of normal journalistic practice."&lt;ref name=post27&gt;Brean, Joseph, [https://nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=618869 "Rights organization dismisses complaint against Maclean's"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080701103344/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=618869 |date=2008-07-01 }}, ''National Post'', June 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also stated that "Maclean's continues to assert that no human rights commission, whether at the federal or provincial level, has the mandate or the expertise to monitor, inquire into, or assess the editorial decisions of the nation's media. And we continue to have grave concerns about a system of complaint and adjudication that allows a media outlet to be pursued in multiple jurisdictions on the same complaint, brought by the same complainants, subjecting it to costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars, to say nothing of the inconvenience. We enthusiastically support those parliamentarians who are calling for legislative review of the commissions with regard to speech issues."&lt;ref name=post27/&gt;

==British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal==
The [[British Columbia]] Human Rights Tribunal heard the case over a five-day period beginning on June 2, 2008; Mohamed Elmasry was not present. The co-complainant in this case is Naiyer Habib, the BC board director for the Canadian Islamic Congress, who filed the complaint on behalf of all Muslims in British Columbia.

[[Joseph Faisal]], legal counsel for the Canadian Islamic Congress opened his arguments by stating that the article ''Maclean's'' published presented Muslims as "a violent people" who hold traditional Canadian values "in contempt," and depicted Islam as "inhuman" and "violent." He also argued that the cover image that ''Maclean's'' chose to run, the image of two Muslim women, along with the magazine's cover line, "could have been the picture of a horror cult movie." Faisal criticized 20 other articles that ran in ''Maclean's'', beginning in January 2005 that he claimed were offensive to Muslims and  criticized ''Maclean's'' for publishing letters from readers praising the magazine and Steyn.&lt;ref name=BCHRT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=560599 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080610022434/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=560599 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 10, 2008 |title=The court of last resort |author=Hutchinson, Brian |work=National Post |date=June 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Faisal added that "We're prepared to deal with those articles piece by piece, paragraph by paragraph, and those things that we find objectionable."&lt;ref name=BCHRT2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/06/02/bc-macleans-human-rights.html?ref=rss|title=B.C. tribunal hears complaint against Maclean's article|publisher=CBC News|date=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faisal and Habib's complaint claims that ''Maclean's'' and Steyn, who wrote the article, violated Section 7-1 of British Columbia's Human Rights Code, which stipulates that a person must not publish or cause to be published anything that discriminates against a person or group, or exposes them to hatred or contempt.&lt;ref name=BCHRT2/&gt; Under the BC Human Rights code, the complainants are not required to prove harm, or malicious intent; all that is required is a reasonable determination that the excerpt did express hatred and contempt toward Muslims, and likely caused it to spread.&lt;ref name=NP5/&gt;

Faisal implored the BC Human Rights Tribunal to take action, arguing that it is "the court of last resort. You are the only opportunity to right a terrible wrong to a clearly identifiable group numbering hundreds of thousands in this great country, and tens of thousands in the beautiful province of British Columbia. You are the only thing between racist, hateful, contemptuous Islamophobic and irresponsible journalism, and law-abiding Canadian citizens."&lt;ref name=BCHRT/&gt;

[[Mahmoud M. Ayoub|Mahmoud Ayoub]], a historian of religion with a doctorate from [[Harvard University]], testified that Steyn's claim in his article that Islam is "an underground movement trying to take over the world" has no basis in Islamic scripture or tradition.&lt;ref name=7june/&gt; Ayoub disputed Steyn's interpretation of the word "[[jihad]]," asserting that the word has  a variety of meanings unrelated to violence. Ayoub also disputed Steyn's portrayal of Islamic extremism as mainstream saying that the extremist fringe represented less than one million of the total 1.5 billion Muslims.&lt;ref name=7june/&gt;

Lawyers for ''Maclean's'' argued that publication of the article is part of free speech and open debate. [[Julian Porter]], the lead counsel for the magazine, asserted that Steyn's article "does not meet the standard of hatred or contempt, and that's what we'll argue later in the week".&lt;ref name=BCHRT2/&gt; The lawyers for ''Maclean's'' did not call any witnesses during the week of hearings and instead argued against the complaint on constitutional grounds.&lt;ref name=7june/&gt;

In his closing arguments, Faisal stated that "There has never been a case in this country that has had such clear, concise evidence, ever. There will never be any more demonstrable evidence of hatred that has been perpetrated by this article." Faisal also sharply criticized Julian Porter, one of Maclean's lawyers, stating that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If [Mr. Porter] had his way, each and every Muslim in the country [would] also bear the additional albatross that, apparently, we as Muslims in the country are responsible, personally, for Osama Bin Laden. How ridiculous - this is the type of mindset that prevails in the media.&lt;ref name=NP5&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=569574 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080614204214/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=569574 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 14, 2008 |title=Steyn watches as tribunal winds up |author=Brian Hutchinson |work=National Post |date=June 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Canadian Association of Journalists]] and the BC Civil Liberties Association presented a joint submission asking the tribunal to refine its interpretation of [[hate speech]] saying that previous rulings have been "overly expansive" and "have consequently brought the institutional legitimacy of the (tribunal) into question."&lt;ref name=7june/&gt;

If ''Maclean's'' is found to have violated BC's Human Rights Code, it could face sanctions, including payment to the complainant "an amount that the member or panel considers appropriate to compensate that person for injury to dignity, feelings and self respect or to any of them." However, Faisal has stated that he only wants the Tribunal to order ''Maclean's'' to publish "an appropriate response."&lt;ref name=BCHRT/&gt; The Tribunal's hearing concluded on June 8, 2008.&lt;ref name=BCHRT2/&gt;

===Comments following the hearings===
Steyn told the media that he was hoping the tribunal would rule against ''Maclean's''. "We want to lose so we can take it to a real court and if necessary up to the Supreme Court of Canada and we can get the ancient liberties of free-born Canadian citizens that have been taken away from them by tribunals like this," he said.&lt;ref name=7june&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5iVIW-FxvuTumZb5jpsKXrJa0bS4w |title=Maclean's writer dares B.C. Human Rights Tribunal to rule against him |work=Canadian Press |date=June 9, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702184944/http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5iVIW-FxvuTumZb5jpsKXrJa0bS4w |archivedate=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steyn was not called to testify at the hearing but was in attendance for several of the five days of the proceedings.&lt;ref name=7june/&gt;

The day after the hearing ended, Khurrum Awan, one of the complainants in the BC case, spoke to a meeting of the [[Canadian Arab Federation]] and complained that since ''Maclean's'' is not a member of the [[Ontario Press Council]] or any similar body there is no authority within the profession of journalism, that can "condemn the journalist, condemn the publication, direct them to publish a letter to the editor." He added that he would "love" to see the case appealed into the regular courts.&lt;ref name=NP5b&gt;Brean, Joseph, "[https://nationalpost.com/story.html?id=573457 Muslims told to insist on equal voice in media]",{{dead link|date=December 2017}} ''National Post'', June 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Awan also stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And we have to tell them, you know what, if you're not going to allow us to do that, there will be consequences. You will be taken to the human rights commission, you will be taken to the press council, and you know what? If you manage to get rid of the human rights code provisions [on hate speech], we will then take you to the civil courts system. And you know what? Some judge out there might just think that perhaps it's time to have a tort of group defamation, and you might be liable for a few million dollars.&lt;ref name=NP5b/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]] conference of the [[Canadian Association of Statutory Human Rights Agencies]] in June 2008, Wahida Valiante, national vice-president of the Canadian Islamic Congress, stated that the commissions are the only recourse available to minorities treated unfairly in the media since membership in press councils is optional and criminal hate speech charges require the consent of the federal Attorney-General.&lt;ref name=NP06212008&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=602841|date=June 21, 2008|author=Joseph Brean|title=Human rights issues open to vigorous debate|work=National Post|accessdate=2008-06-22}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valiante compared Steyn to [[James Keegstra]], an Alberta high school teacher who taught and tested his students on how Jews "created the Holocaust to gain sympathy. They basically talk about the same theories. This is not a civil dialogue." She said that, in Germany, long before the Holocaust, "it was the words that set the stage for what happened later on.... We may end up with the same fate, and that is at the heart of why [the complainants] wanted to take this on."&lt;ref name=NP06212008/&gt;

[[Haroon Siddiqui]], a columnist for the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', wrote that "Only genuine misunderstanding or deliberate distortion can explain the media's mostly one-sided discourse on the case of Maclean's before the federal, as well as the Ontario and British Columbia, human rights commissions." Siddiqui asserted that the Canadian media "do not publish racist cartoons and anti-Semitic rants" and "that Maclean's published a series of virulent articles about Muslims itself speaks volumes." Siddiqui also wrote that Mark Steyn's article was "a 4,800-word piece portraying Muslims as a menace to the West.".&lt;ref name=TS6222008&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/447121|date=June 22, 2008|author=Haroon Siddiqui|title=Hate laws a reasonable limit on free speech|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruling===
On October 10, 2008, the tribunal dismissed the complaint, stating that the Maclean's article did not violate the province's human rights law. The tribunal stated that the article contained historical, religious and factual inaccuracies, relied on common Muslim stereotypes and tried to "rally public opinion by exaggeration and causing the reader to fear Muslims." However, they also ruled that the article was not likely to expose Muslims to hatred or contempt.&lt;ref name=npruling&gt;[https://nationalpost.com/most_popular/story.html?id=874166 Maclean's wins third round of hate fight] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20081012181216/http://www.nationalpost.com/most_popular/story.html?id=874166 |date=2008-10-12 }} by Joseph Brean, National Post, October 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tribunal stated that "With all its inaccuracies and hyperbole, [the article] has resulted in political debate which, in our view, [B. C.'s hate speech human rights law] was never intended to suppress. In fact, as the evidence in this case amply demonstrates, the debate has not been suppressed and the concerns about the impact of hate speech silencing a minority have not been borne out."&lt;ref name=npruling/&gt;

===Comments following the ruling===
Faisal Joseph, lawyer for the CIC, stated that he may appeal because the decision "sends the wrong message." In a statement, Joseph wrote that "it is now acceptable for some columnists and media in this country to cloak freedom to hate in the mantle of freedom of speech." However, Joseph also stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our objective of exposing Maclean's and Mark Steyn for their falsehoods, and misrepresentation and stereotyping of Muslims has been achieved. We are delighted the tribunal has discredited the content of the articles that Maclean's and Mark Steyn have been publishing about Islam and Muslims. We also appreciate the tribunal's citing of the vitriolic blogs related to the Maclean's article as some evidence that the article exposes Muslims to hatred and contempt...On the whole, however, the case was a leap forward in the struggle against media-propagated Islamophobia. The fact that human rights commissions in Ontario and B. C. have recognized the role of Canada's national news magazine in promoting societal intolerance towards Muslim Canadians and in publishing false and exaggerated material highlights the urgent need for editors and newscasters to critically examine how they represent Muslims in their news and editorial coverage.&lt;ref name=npruling/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Mark Steyn]], who wrote the offending article, stated that a lesser-known writer without a media conglomerate in his corner probably would have been convicted, adding that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For me the problem is not the book, the problem for me is Canada, and I will never think of the deranged dominion quite the same way again. It has made me understand just how easily and incrementally free societies, often for the most fluffy reasons, slip into a kind of soft, beguiling totalitarianism. I don't understand why they lack the cojones to find us guilty&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and that "The only reason to go through all this nonsense is to get to the stage where you can appeal it to a real court, and if necessary up to the Supreme Court".&lt;ref name=npruling/&gt; Steyn further criticized the Human Rights Commissions and Canadian politicians, stating that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
they didn't like the heat they were getting under this case. Life was chugging along just fine, chastising non-entities nobody had ever heard about, piling up a lot of cockamamie jurisprudence that inverts the principles of common law, and nobody paid any attention to it. Once they got the glare of publicity from the Maclean's case, the kangaroos decided to jump for the exit. I've grown tired of the number of Canadian members of Parliament who've said to me over the last best part of a year now, "Oh, well of course I fully support you, I'm fully behind you, but I'd just be grateful if you didn't mention my name in public".&lt;ref name=npruling/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Julian Porter]], the lawyer for Rogers Publishing (which owns [[Maclean's]]) stated that the case illustrated how human rights commissions are neither trained nor equipped to rule on journalistic disputes, which require the delicate balancing of constitutional rights, stating that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It means that when you're making an editorial decision, you have to look over your shoulder at this grey, fuzzy monster of the human rights commission ...Suddenly, we're in a position where an immense group can, in effect, bring a libel action without the libel defences [of truth or fair comment].&lt;ref name=npruling/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other criticism===
The complaints prompted criticism of the CIC from various writers as well as a [[Canadian Cabinet|federal cabinet]] minister, [[Secretary of State (Canada)|Secretary of State]] for [[Multiculturalism]] [[Jason Kenney]], who said "attacking opinions expressed by a columnist in a major magazine is a pretty bold attack on the basic Canadian value of freedom of the press and freedom of expression."&lt;ref&gt;Ditchburn, Jennifer, "Tory minister slams Islamic Congress complaint against journalist", ''Canadian Press'', December 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Hutchinson, of the ''[[National Post]]'', criticized the BC Human Rights Tribunal for agreeing to hear testimony from Khurrum Awan, one of the student lawyers who helped with the human rights complaint in Ontario on how Muslims in British Columbia were affected by the article. ''Maclean's'' argued that because Awan is not a resident of British Columbia, he should not be allowed to give testimony about the harm the article allegedly caused to Muslims in BC. However, Heather MacNaughton, the Chairwoman of the Tribunal, allowed his testimony, justifying the decision by stating that "strict rules of evidence do not apply" in cases before the Tribunal.&lt;ref name=BCHRT/&gt;

Jason Gratl, a lawyer for the Canadian Association of Journalists and the BC Civil Liberties Association, criticized the hearing, stating that "We're of the view in the first place that the human rights tribunal doesn't have any business deciding what appropriate expression in Canada might be. Its activities and jurisdictions undermine the ability of journalists and members of the public to discuss important public issues such as race and religion."&lt;ref name=BCHRT2/&gt;

[[Ezra Levant]], former publisher of the ''[[Western Standard]]'' Magazine, and the former target of a complaint to the [[Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission]], opined that "I think this strikes at press freedom and even the freedom of thought of all Canadians. I think it's really an embarrassment that this is happening."&lt;ref name=BCHRT2/&gt;

In April, 2008 the Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC) stated that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the complaint, launched by Elmasry, based on a gap in the legislation (the relevant portions of the [[Ontario Human Rights Code]] only address discrimination via signs or symbols, not printed material). Despite not having jurisdiction, the Commission published a statement saying that ''Maclean's'' media coverage "has been identified as contributing to Islamophobia and promoting societal intolerance towards Muslim, Arab and South Asian Canadians".  The Commission indicated that more discussion on the topic of Islamophobia in the media was warranted.&lt;ref name=ohrc&gt;[http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/resources/news/en/resources/news/statement Ontario Human Rights Public Statement].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruling===
While it dismissed the complaint by the CIC against ''Maclean's'', the OHRC also issued a statement saying the article in question "portray[ed] Muslims as all sharing the same negative characteristics, including being a threat to ‘the West’," and thus promoted prejudice towards Muslims and others.&lt;ref name=ohrc/&gt; In an interview, Chief Commissioner [[Barbara Hall (politician)|Barbara Hall]] stated that "When the media writes, it should exercise great caution that it's not promoting stereotypes that will adversely impact on identifiable groups. I think one needs to be very careful when one speaks in generalities, that in fact one is speaking factually about all the people in a particular group."&lt;ref name="Complaint1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=433915|title=Rights body dismisses Maclean's case|author=Brean, Joseph|work=National Post|date=April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comments following the ruling===

====Response from Canadian Islamic Congress====
Faisal Joseph, a lawyer for the complainants, said he was "delighted" by the Commission's strong stance against the magazine, despite the failure of the complaint. He said he knew the complaint would probably be dismissed, "but we thought this would be an excellent way to demonstrate the gaping hole in human rights legislation in Ontario, and the [Commission] has done exactly that." He also noted that other provincial human rights codes have provisions against published writings, and argued that it is "ridiculous" that Ontario does not. He said the inconsistency will require intervention by the Attorney-General to broaden the scope of the legislation."&lt;ref name="Complaint1"/&gt;

====Criticism of Hall and the OHRC====
Hall's statement drew criticism from a number of sources.

[[Tarek Fatah]], a founder of the [[Muslim Canadian Congress]] stated that for the Commission "to refer to Maclean's magazine and journalists as contributing to racism is bullshit, if you can use that word" and that the Commission has unfairly taken sides against freedom of speech in a dispute within the Canadian Muslim community between moderates and fundamentalists. "There are within the staff [of the Ontario Human Rights Commission], and among the commissioners, hardline Islamic supporters of Islamic extremism, and this [handling of the Maclean's case] reflects their presence over there" and that "In the eyes of the Ontario human rights commission, the only good Muslim is an Islamist Muslim. As long as we hate Canada, we will be cared for. As soon as we say Canada is our home and we have to defend her traditions, freedoms and secular democracy, we will be considered as the outside."&lt;ref name=critic1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/most_popular/story.html?id=433915|date=April 9, 2008|title=Rights body dismisses Maclean's case|author=Joseph Brean|work=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported by an article from [[Barbara Kay]] in the National Post, Fatah stated in a press conference (on October 2, 2008) that the OHRC has been "infiltrated by Islamists" and that some of its commissioners are closely linked to the [[Canadian Islamic Congress]] and the [[Canadian Arab Federation]], both of which, according to Fatah, have "contempt for Canadian values."&lt;ref name=National1&gt;[http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2008/10/02/barbara-kay-the-islamist-elephant-in-the-room-no-politicians-will-acknowledge.aspx Barbara Kay, The Islamist elephant in the room no politicians will acknowledge]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by [[Barbara Kay]], [[National Post]], October 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Kay]], a columnist for the ''National Post'' also criticized Hall's leadership of the OHRC in the aftermath of the decision, writing that Hall was had been influenced by "radicals" in the OHRC bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2008/04/10/jonathan-kay-on-the-ontario-human-rights-commission-some-interesting-thoughts-from-a-former-government-insider.aspx |title=Jonathan Kay on the Ontario Human Rights Commission: Some interesting thoughts from a former government insider |author=Kay, Jonathan |work=National Post |date=April 10, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kay also stating that the OHRC statement was "a genuinely frightening manifesto written by people who have a thinly disguised contempt for press freedom and heterodox opinions." Kay argued that if a media outlet chooses "to be "unfair," or simply to have an opinion that some people, or even everyone, disagrees with, that's our right. We'll pay the price in lost readers and advertisers."&lt;ref name=Complaint2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/opinion/story.html?id=434023 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080411062941/http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/story.html?id=434023 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 11, 2008 |title=Ontario's spooky thought police |work=National Post |author=Kay, Jonathan |date=April 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Steyn, who wrote the article in ''Maclean's'' that the complaint was based on, commented that "Even though they (the OHRC) don't have the guts to hear the case, they might as well find us guilty. Ingenious!"&lt;ref name="Complaint1"/&gt;

====Hall's response====
In an  interview, Hall defended her actions and her comments about ''Maclean's'', stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Every day we comment on things that aren't [formal] cases. Part of our job is to identify discrimination and to work to address it, but more often it is putting out a statement, having a debate, meeting with people, discussing and understanding the impact. Whenever we comment on what someone has said or done, we comment because we want them to think about the Human Rights Code, and the implications of it, and to think seriously about what they're saying or doing does to other people. I think that's an important and legitimate part of our role... I think that part of freedom of speech is being able to say things and another part of it is being able to be critical of things that are said. I don't view it as a chill. I view it as responsibility.&lt;ref name=NP4&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/story.html?id=456006|title=A friend of free speech?|author=Kay, Jonathan|work=National Post|date=April 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====''Maclean's'' responds====
The editors of ''Maclean's'' denounced the OHRC for its "zealous condemnation of their journalism" accusing them of "morphing out of their conciliatory roles to become crusaders working to reshape journalistic discourse in Canada." ''Maclean's'' alleged that Hall's press release was "a drive-by smear," and "perhaps the greatest disappointment in this whole saga." &lt;ref name=NP4/&gt;  The editors claimed that "[Hall] cited no evidence, considered no counter-arguments, and appointed herself prosecutor, judge and jury in one fell swoop. If we weren't tolerant and charitable people, we'd be calling for her resignation."&lt;ref name=NP4/&gt;

====OHRC's letter to ''Maclean's''====
On April 2008, OHRC Chief Commissioner [[Barbara Hall (politician)|Barbara Hall]] wrote a letter to ''Maclean's'', which the magazine subsequently published as a letter to the editor. Hall wrote that once that decision to dismiss the complaint was made, the OHRC was "free to comment on the issues raised. We followed the correct process for both aspects of our mandate under section 29 of the Ontario Human Rights Code – protecting and promoting human rights in order to create "… a climate of understanding and mutual respect for the dignity and worth of each person…," as set out in the Preamble.&lt;ref name=OHRCletter&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/resources/news/macleansletter|title=Rights Letter to the Editor published in Maclean's Magazine|author=Hall, Barbara|publisher=OHRC (printed in Maclean's Magazine)|date=April 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall further stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Maclean’s'' and its writers are free to express their opinions. The OHRC is mandated to express what it sees as unfair and harmful comment or conduct that may lead to discrimination. We need to keep in mind that freedom of expression is not the only right in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter]]. There is a full set of rights accorded to all members of our society, including freedom from discrimination. No single right is any more or less important than another. And the enjoyment of one depends on the enjoyment of the other. This means if you want to stand up and defend the right to freedom of expression then you must be willing to do the same for the right to freedom from discrimination. The human rights system exists in Canada, in part, to shine a light on prejudice and to provoke debate – and action. We called for debate and dialogue; we still do. We have taken controversial views before and no doubt will again. That is inevitable because we have a mandate to promote change – away from unfair stereotypes and discriminatory behaviour and towards a culture of human rights. We agree with the Editors of ''Maclean’s'': critics are entitled to their opinions. Sometimes we must be critical. We have that duty, enshrined in law, to speak up on human rights issues of the day – and we will continue to do so.&lt;ref name=OHRCletter/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Subsequent statements by Elmasry==

Elmasry stated that "You should understand there is a difference between criticizing a religion, OK, comparing it to another religion, and to make a mockery of the symbol of that religion. This is up to the legal system to decide." Elmasry argued that Canadian law is deficient because it lacks the concept of "group defamation," which he explained should be based on the principle that "There is (sic) individual human rights and there is (sic) collective, group human rights, and both of them are very important."&lt;ref name=subsequent&gt;[https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=983139&amp;p=1 'We've been victimized']{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Joseph Brean, National Post, November 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elmasry sharply criticized [[British Columbia]] MP [[Keith Martin (politician)|Keith Martin]], who proposed scrapping the hate speech provision of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Elmasry stated that Martin's proposal was "obviously" motivated by fear of Muslims."&lt;ref name=subsequent/&gt;

==Subsequent statements by Khurrum Awan==
In a subsequent interview with the ''Canadian Arab News'', Khurrum Awan stated that, although the all of the complaints were dismissed, "We attained our strategic objective — to increase the cost of publishing anti-Islamic material"; Awan claimed that Maclean's collective legal costs for the complaints was approximately $2 million."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ottawacitizen.com/2010/01/26/ezra-levant-sued-in-jihad-chill-case/ Ezra Levant sued in "jihad chill"] by Robert Sibley, ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', January 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent legislative action==
The case has been cited as a motivating factor in the repeal of Section 13 of the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/06/07/jonathan-kay-good-riddance-to-section-13-of-the-canadian-human-rights-act/ NP - "Jonathan Kay: Good riddance to Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act" 7 Jun 2012] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130105111536/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/06/07/jonathan-kay-good-riddance-to-section-13-of-the-canadian-human-rights-act/ |date=2013-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hunt Light of the World.jpg|right|thumb|160px|[[William Holman Hunt]]'s ''[[The Light of the World (painting)|The Light of the World]]'']]
'''Light of God''', '''Light of Christ''', '''Christ within''', '''That of God''', '''Spirit of God within us''', '''Light within''', '''inward light''' and '''inner light''' are related phrases commonly used within the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) as metaphors for [[Light of the World|Christ's light]] shining on or in them. It was propagated by the founder of the Quaker movement, [[George Fox]], who "preached faith in and reliance on 'inward light' (the presence of Christ in the heart)".&lt;ref name="GiffordSeidman2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gifford|first1=Don|last2=Seidman|first2=Robert J.|title=Ulysses Annotated: Notes for James Joyce's Ulysses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fE9mkomQHEQC&amp;pg=PA216|accessdate=22 May 2016|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|language=English|isbn=9780520253971|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mink2004&gt;{{cite book|title=Poverty in the United States: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, and Policy|year=2004|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|language=English |isbn=9781576075975|page=615|quote=The doctrine of the Inner Light originated with Quaker founder, George Fox, in 1640s England. It affirmed that every person had the "still, small voice" of God within. Friends traced this belief to scripture, namely John 1:9, which attested to a true light "which lighteth every man".}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Quakers were known to sit in silence and meditate on the words of the [[Bible]] until they felt the inward light of God shining upon them and the [[Holy Spirit]] speaking.&lt;ref name="Parrinder1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|year=1985|publisher=Facts on File|language=English|isbn=9780816012893|page=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Key to the Faith and Practice of the Religious Society of Friends'' states that the Inward Light is "both the historical, living Jesus, and as the Grace of God extended to people that simultaneously makes us conscious of our sins, forgives them, and gives us the strength and the will to overcome them" and "teaches us the difference between right and wrong, truth and falseness, good and evil".&lt;ref name=QuakersOnline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quaker.us/inwardlight.html|title=What Do Friends Mean by the Inward Light?|year=2007|work=The Key to the Faith and Practice of the Religious Society of Friends|publisher=QuakersOnline|language=English|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodge|first=Charles|title=Systematic Theology|date=12 March 2015|publisher=Delmarva Publications, Inc.|language=English|page=137|quote=By the inner light the orthodox Quakers understand the supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit, concerning which they teach, – (1.) That it is given to all men. (2.) That it not only convinces of sin, and enables the soul to apprehend aright the truths of Scripture, but also communicates a knowledge of "the mysteries of salvation." ... The orthodox Friends teach concerning this inward light, as has been already shown, that it is subordinate to the Holy Scriptures, inasmuch as the Scriptures are the infallible rule of faith and practice, and everything contrary thereto is to be rejected as false and destructive.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the word ''light'' is commonly used by Christians (including Quakers) as a metaphor for [[Christ]], derived from many [[Bible|Biblical]] passages including [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#8:12|John 8:12]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quaker.us/inwardlight.html|title=What Do Friends Mean by the Inward Light?|year=2007|work=The Key to the Faith and Practice of the Religious Society of Friends|publisher=QuakersOnline|language=English|accessdate=22 May 2016|quote=The Light in Scripture and Quaker writings is clearly named. Jesus Christ said, "I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life," (John 8:12). John the Baptist "came to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe," (John 1:7). Robert Barclay wrote of other aspects of Jesus and his work as Light: "That for this end God hath communicated and given unto every man a measure of the Light of his own Son, a measure of grace, or a measure of the Spirit, which the Scripture expresses by several names, as sometimes of 'the seed of the kingdom' (Matthew 13:18–19); the 'Light that makes all things manifest' (Ephesians 5:13); the 'Word of God' (Romans 10:17); or manifestation of the Spirit given to profit withal' (1 Corinthians 12:7); 'a talent' (Matthew 25:15); 'the Gospel preached in every creature' (Colossians 1:23)."}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states:
{{cquote|I am the [[Light of the World|light of the world]]. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.}}
Quakers take this idea of walking in the [[Light of Christ]] to refer to [[God's presence]] within a person, and to a direct and personal experience of God, although this varies to some extent between Quakers in different [[yearly meeting]]s. Quakers believe not only that individuals can be guided by this light, but that Friends might meet together and receive collective guidance from God by sharing the concerns and leadings that he gives to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quakersfp.live.poptech.coop/qfp/chap1/1.02.html |title=Quaker Faith and Practice (Third edition) – Advices and Queries |accessdate=26 March 2008 |author=Britain Yearly Meeting |year=1994 |publisher=Britain Yearly Meeting |quote=We can worship alone, but when we join with others in expectant waiting we may discover a deeper sense of God's presence.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often done in [[meeting for worship]]; Pierre Lacout, a Swiss Quaker, describes a "silence which is active" causing the Inner Light to "glow", in his book ''God is silence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lacout|first=Pierre|title=God is silence|year=1993|publisher=Quaker Home Service|location=London|isbn=0-85245-253-5|edition=Pocket|translator=John Kay |page=20|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Friends meeting it is usually called "ministry" when a person shares aloud what the Inner Light is saying to him or her. The term ''inward light'' was first used by early Friends to refer to Christ's light shining on them; the term ''inner light'' has also been used to since twentieth century to describe this Quaker doctrine. [[Rufus Jones (writer)|Rufus Jones]], in 1904, wrote that: "''The Inner Light is the doctrine that there is something Divine, 'Something of God' in the human soul''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Rufus|title=Social Law in the Spiritual World: Studies in Human and Divine Inter-Relationship|year=1904|pages=167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones argued that his interpretation of the Quaker doctrine of the inner light was something shared by George Fox and other early Quakers, but some Quaker theologians and historians, most notably [[Lewis Benson]] reject this viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benson|first=Lewis|title=That of God in every man: What did George Fox mean by it?|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Light of Christ|Light of the World}}
Related terms for Inner Light include ''Light of God'', ''Light of Christ'', ''Christ within'', ''That of God'', ''Spirit of God within us'', and ''Light within''. These are often used interchangeably by modern and arguably early Friends. Some people also identify it with the expression "that of God in everyone", which was first used by one of the co-founders of the Society of Friends, [[George Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Journal of George Fox |editor=John L. Nickals |publisher=Religious Society of Friends |date=1975 |page=774}} light of Christ, xl,xliii,xliv,12,14,16,29,33–5,60,64,76,80,88,92,115,117,135,143–4,150,155,173,174–6,188,191,205,225–6,234–7,245,274–5,283–4,294–6,303–5,309,312,317-19335,339–40,347–8,361,471–2,496–7,575,642&lt;/ref&gt;

The related term "Inward light" appears in older Quaker writings, but is not used as often now.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Originally, Inward Light was used much more often than "Inner Light".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vann. [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=3614997381378 "Review of Rosemary Moore, ''The Light in Their Consciences: The Early Quakers in Britain 1646–1666,''"] H-Albion, H-Net Reviews, July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This term evokes an image of people being illuminated by the light of God or Christ, rather than having a light of their own inside them. Although the terms are now often used interchangeably, according to Quaker historian Pink Dandelion, not until incorrectly [[Rufus Jones (writer)|Rufus Jones]] used the terms interchangeably were the terms thought of as equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Pink |last1=Dandelion |title=An Introduction to Quakerism |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2007 |page=132-132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis ==
[[File:Fox-George-LOC.jpg|alt=|thumb|Quaker belief in the Inner Light extends back to founder [[George Fox]]&lt;ref name=Mink2004/&gt;]] 
[[File:QuakersPennsylvanie.jpg|250px|left|thumb|''Quakers embrassant des Indiens en Pennsylvanie'' (Quakers embracing [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in Pennsylvania) by [[:fr:Clément-Pierre Marillier|Clément-Pierre Marillier]]]]
The Quaker belief that the Inward Light shines on each person is based in part on a passage from the [[New Testament]], namely [[s:Bible (King James)/John#Chapter 1|John 1:9]], which says, "That was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world." Early Friends took this verse as one of their mottos and often referred to themselves as "Children of the Light". Moreover, Friends emphasize the part of the verse that indicates that the Light "is extended to all people everywhere", even "people who have never heard of [[Christianity]] in a meaningful way or at all can share in the Light, if they sincerely respond to God's grace. ''For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or excuse them on the day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus'' (Romans 2:14–16)."&lt;ref name=QuakersOnline/&gt;

The principal founder of what became the Religious Society of Friends, [[George Fox]], claimed that he had a direct experience of God.  Having explored various sects and listened to an assortment of preachers, he finally concluded that none of them were adequate to be his ultimate guide.  At that point he reported hearing a voice that told him, "There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy condition."  He felt that God wanted him to teach others that they need not depend on human teachers or guides either, because each one of them could experience God directly and hear his voice within.  He wrote in his journal, "I was glad that I was commanded to turn people to that ''inward light'', spirit, and grace, by which all might know their salvation, and their way to God; even that divine Spirit which would lead them into all Truth, and which I infallibly knew would never deceive any."&lt;ref name=journal&gt;[http://www.qis.net/~daruma/fox-ministry.html Quotes by George Fox in his journal]&lt;/ref&gt; Fox taught: that Christ, the Light, had come to teach his people himself; that "people had no need of any teacher but the Light that was in all men and women" (the anointing they had received);&lt;ref name=journal/&gt; if people would be silent, waiting on God, the Light would teach them how to conduct their lives, teach them about Christ, show them the condition of their hearts; they loving the Light, it would rid them of the "cause of sin"; and soon after, Christ would return in his glory to establish his Kingdom in their hearts. Fox called the Light destroying sin within as the Cross of Christ, the Power of God.

Regarding this, Fox wrote, "Now ye that know the power of God and are come to it—which is the Cross of Christ, that crucifies you to the state that Adam and Eve were in the fall, and so to the world—by this power of God ye come to see the state they were in before they fell, which power of God is the Cross, in which stands the everlasting glory; which brings up into the righteousness, holiness and image of God, and crucifies to the unrighteousness, unholiness and image of Satan." The Cross is no "dead fact stranded on the shore of the oblivious years", but is to be a living experience deep in the heart of the believer, and changing his whole life. "You that know the power and feel the power, you feel the Cross of Christ, you feel the Gospel, which is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth."  All real experience of the Cross must lead, he thought, to the same way of life that brought the Master there—to the way of humility and non-resistance, of overcoming evil by the sole force of love and goodness. To Fox it seemed that a high profession of Christianity often went with a way of life in flagrant opposition to this. He writes to the persecutors: "Your fruits have manifested that you are not of this (wisdom from above); and so out of the power of God which is the Cross of Christ; for you are found in the world, out of the power of God, out of the Cross of Christ, persecuting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strecorsoc.org/grubb/qth01.html |title=Quaker Thought &amp; History; Chapter 1 – George Fox and Christian Theology |accessdate=17 December 2008 |author=Edward Grubb|year=1925|publisher=The MacMillan Company |quote=Now ye that know the power of God and are come to it—which is the Cross of Christ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, [[Robert Barclay]], an [[apologetics|apologist]] for the Society of Friends, wrote: "This most certain doctrine being then received, that there is an evangelical and saving ''Light'' and grace in all, the universality of the love and mercy of God towards mankind, both in the death of his beloved Son the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the manifestation of the ''Light'' in the heart, is established and confirmed, against all the objections of such as deny it."{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

== Contrast with other inner sources ==

Many Friends consider this divine guidance (or "promptings" or "leadings of the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]]") distinct both from impulses originating within oneself and from generally agreed-on moral guidelines.  In fact, as Marianne McMullen pointed out, a person can be prompted to say something in meeting that is contrary to what he or she thinks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quakersfp.live.poptech.coop/qfp/chap2/2.35.html#2.56 Margaret Hope Bacon, 1986] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517060611/http://quakersfp.live.poptech.coop/qfp/chap2/2.35.html |date=17 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Friends do not usually consider the Inner Light the conscience or moral sensibility but something higher and deeper that informs and sometimes corrects these aspects of human nature.

== Contrast with rules and creeds ==

Historically, Friends have been suspicious of formal creeds or religious philosophy that is not grounded in one's own experience.  Instead one must be guided by the Inward Teacher, the Inner Light.  This is not, however, a release for Friends to decide and do whatever they want; it is incumbent upon Friends to consider the wisdom of other Friends, as one must listen for the Inner Light of others as well as their own.  Friends have various established procedures for collectively discerning and following the Spirit while making decisions.

Friends procedure is to collect together their best advice in a book of "Faith and Practice", which is revised gradually over time.  Many or most books of Faith and Practice contain the following, which was originally attached to a list of "Advices" published in 1656, and illustrates Friends' emphasis on the Inner Light:

: Dearly beloved Friends, these things we do not lay upon you as a rule or form to walk by, but that all, with the measure of light which is pure and holy, may be guided: and so in the light walking and abiding, these may be fulfilled in the Spirit, not from the letter, for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyym.org/quakerism/fnp/6.shtml NY Yearly Meeting on Faith]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Bible ==
[[File:AssemblyOfQuakers.jpg|thumb|400px|A female Quaker [[Homiletics|preaches]] at a [[meeting for worship]]]]
Friends are not in complete agreement on the importance of the Inner Light in relation to the Bible.  Most Friends, especially in the past, have looked to the Bible as a source of wisdom and guidance.  Many, if not most of them, have considered the Bible a book [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] by God. Early Quakers, like George Fox and Robert Barclay, as well as most modern Quakers (including the [[Conservative Friends]], [[Evangelical Friends Church International|Evangelical Friends]], [[Friends United Meeting|Gurneyite Friends]] and [[Central Yearly Meeting of Friends|Holiness Friends]]) believed that promptings which were truly from the [[Holy Spirit]] would not contradict the Bible.  They did, furthermore, believe that to correctly understand the Bible, one needed the Inner Light to clarify it and guide one in applying its teachings to current situations.  In the United States, in the nineteenth century, some Friends{{Who|date=December 2017}} concluded that others of their faith, especially those of the Liberal Friends tradition, were using the concept of the Inner Light to justify unbiblical views.  These Friends held that the Bible was more authoritative than the Inner Light and should be used to test personal leadings.  Friends remain formally, but usually respectfully, divided on the matter.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The '''Jewish Cemetery of Coro''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Cementerio Judío de Coro'') is the oldest Jewish cemetery in continuous use in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esefarad.com/?p=6455 Venezuela: El primer cementario judío de Sudamérica es reacondicionado]. eSefarad.com {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Its origin can be located in the 19th century, when [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] from the [[Netherlands Antilles|Dutch]] colony of [[Curaçao]] began to migrate to the [[Venezuela]]n city of [[Santa Ana de Coro]] in 1824. The cemetery started to function in 1832 by Mr. Joseph Curiel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iajgs.org/cemetery/venezuela/coro-falcon.html International Jewish Cemetery Project - CORO: Falcon]&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife, Debora Levy Maduro, who had bought a plot of land near the city to bury their daughter, Hana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cementeriosdelmundo.blogcindario.com/2006/10/00011-cementerio-judio-de-coro-venezuela.html Cementerio Judio de Coro, Venezuela] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528215753/http://cementeriosdelmundo.blogcindario.com/2006/10/00011-cementerio-judio-de-coro-venezuela.html |date=2008-05-28 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the cemetery beautiful tombs and mausoleums can be found, in an impressive amount for the size and wealth of the city, which have remained as reminders of a time when Jews flourished in the city, thanks to the rise of trade with the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. The cemetery is located in the Pantano Abajo area, between Roosevelt Avenue and Zamora street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mipunto.com/venezuelavirtual/000/002/011/001/010.html El Cementerio Judío] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123065712/http://www.mipunto.com/venezuelavirtual/000/002/011/001/010.html |date=2009-11-23 }}. MiPunto.com {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cemetery is also the grave of the [[Venezuela]]n poet of [[sephardi|Sephardic Jewish]] origin [[Elias David Curiel]].

==Conservation issues==
The cemetery was restored in the 1970s, thanks to the support of the [[Israelite Association of Venezuela]] and the national government. Since 2005 [[Santa Ana de Coro]] has been on the [[list of World Heritage in Danger]] due to heavy rains affecting all historic constructions in the city. An agreement was signed in 2009 between the [[Caracas Center for Sephardic Studies]], representing the [[Israelite Association of Venezuela|IAV]], and [[Constructora Sambil]], which is a construction company owned by [[Salomon Cohen]] of famous Jewish family, to rebuild the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmidigital.com/secciones.php?id=3&amp;top_id=6858&amp;s=10 Refaccionarán el Cementerio Judío de Coro] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714190701/http://www.nmidigital.com/secciones.php?id=3&amp;top_id=6858&amp;s=10 |date=2011-07-14 }}.

'''José Andrés Pacheco de Melo''' (17 October 1779 &amp;ndash; approx. 1820) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] statesman and priest. He was a representative to the [[Congress of Tucumán]] which on 9 July 1816 [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declared the Independence of Argentina]].

Pacheco de Melo was born in [[Salta]] and studied there alongside [[Martín Güemes]]. He entered the [[seminary]] of Our Lady of Loreto in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and was ordained in 1801 by Bishop Moscoso of [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucumán]].

Pacheco de Melo became a priest in [[Livi-Livi]] in [[Chichas]] (now [[Bolivia]]) and used his position to assist the revolutionary forces in [[Alto Perú]].
He was elected by Chichas to the [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucumán]] Congress and served in 1816 for the declaration, although there had been a long debate about the legitimacy of his election.

After the Congress moved to [[Buenos Aires]] Pacheco de Melo chaired it in 1818. He subsequently served as a government minister in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. His death is unclear, believed to have been in 1820 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311124013/http://www.me.gov.ar/efeme/9dejulio/pacheco.html], and Urquidi notes that he died in Chichas.

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}

The '''''Kitáb-i-Aqdas''''' or '''''Aqdas''''' is the central book of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] written by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the religion, in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Saiedi, 2000, pp. 224-235.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was written in Arabic under the Arabic title '''''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Kitābu l-Aqdas}}''''' ({{lang-ar|الكتاب الأقدس}}  / ''al-Kitāb al-ʾaqdās''), but it is commonly referred to by its Persian title, ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' ({{lang-fa|كتاب اقدس}}  / ''Ketâb Âqdas''), which was given to the work by Bahá'u'lláh himself. It is sometimes also referred to as  "the Most Holy Book", "the Book of Laws" or the '''Book of Aqdas'''. The word Aqdas has a significance in many languages as the superlative form of a word with its primary letters [[Q-D-Š]].

Bahá'u'lláh had manuscript copies sent to Bahá'ís in Iran some years after the revelation of the ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' in 1873, and in 1890–91 (1308 [[Islamic calendar|AH]], 47 [[Baha'i calendar|BE]]) he arranged for the publication of the original Arabic text of the book in Bombay, India.

The ''Aqdas'' is referred to as "the Mother-Book" of the Bahá'í teachings, and the "Charter of the future world civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|pp=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not, however, only a 'book of laws': much of the content deals with other matters, notably ethical exhortations and addresses to various individuals, groups, and places. The ''Aqdas'' also discusses the establishment of Bahá'í administrative institutions, Bahá'í religious practices, mysticism, laws of personal status, criminal law, spiritual and ethical exhortations, social principles, miscellaneous laws and abrogations, and prophecies.

== Gradual implementation ==
{{main|Bahá'í laws}}

Bahá'u'lláh stated that the observance of the laws that he prescribed should be subject to "tact and wisdom", and that they do not cause "disturbance and dissension."&lt;ref name="PSmith-law"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=law |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aqdas6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bahá'u'lláh|1873|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'u'lláh thus provided for the progressive application of his laws; for example certain Bahá'í laws are only applicable to [[Middle East]]ern Bahá'ís such as the limit to the period of engagement, while any Bahá'í may practice the laws if they so decide.&lt;ref name="PSmith-law"/&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]] also stated that certain other laws, such as criminal laws, that are dependent upon the existence of a predominantly Bahá'í society would only be applicable in a possible future Bahá'í society.&lt;ref name="PSmith-law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSmith160"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that if the laws were in conflict with the civil law of the country where a Bahá'í  lives the laws could not be practiced.&lt;ref name="PSmith-law"/&gt; Furthermore, some laws and teachings are, according to Bahá'í teaching, not meant to be applied at the present time and their application depends on decisions by the [[Universal House of Justice]]. Baha'is believe the Aqdas supersedes and succeeds previous revelations such as the [[Quran]] and the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/bhi/aqdas.htm The Aqdas; Universal House of Justice] A DESCRIPTION OF THE AQDAS BY SHOGHI EFFENDI&lt;/ref&gt;

== Form and style ==

The text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas consists of several hundred verses, which have been grouped in 189 numbered paragraphs in the English translation most of which are just a few sentences.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Danesh |first=Roshan |title=Internationalism and Divine Law: A Bahá'í Perspective |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=209–242 |year=2003–2004 |jstor=3649175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style combines elements of both [[Arabic poetry|poetry]] (''shi'r'') and [[rhymed prose]] (''saj{{'}}'') and the text contains instances of [[literary devices]] like [[alliteration]], [[assonance]], [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], [[onomatopoeia]], [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtaposition]] and [[antithesis]], [[metaphor]]s, [[Narration#Narrative point of view#Alternating person|alternation of person]] and [[personification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushrui|1994|pp=39–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rules and principles are interspersed and guide interpretation, and authority and limits for authorized interpretation are also specified. It defines a [[Bahá'í Administration]] as part of the [[Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh]], and also speaks to the individual reader, as there are no [[clergy]] in the religion to rely on for guidance. The text also moves between statements said to be plain and statements suggesting the key to understanding the book is to look at the text for clues to itself.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt; Some statements reflect on the [[Bahá'í teachings|teachings]] in the religion on various themes and underscore a relationship of the Aqdas as a 'motherhood' in relation to all the other scriptural works and they to it. It also relates to scriptures of other religions by abrogation, explanation, affirmation or reformation &amp;mdash; an example of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]] as a principle of the religion. While it is the core text on laws of the religion, it is not the exclusive source of laws in the religion, nor of Bahá'u'lláh's own writings, and complementarily the reader is told explicitly to not view the text as a "mere code of laws".&lt;ref name="JLR18-3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=Udo |title=An Introduction to Baha'i Law: Doctrinal Foundations, Principles and Structures |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=307–372 |year=2002–2003 |jstor=1602268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas was completed by Bahá'u'lláh in 1873.

== Content ==

The ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' is supplemented by the 
*"Questions and Answers"', which consists of 107 questions submitted to Bahá'u'lláh by [[Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin]] concerning the application of the laws and Bahá'u'lláh's replies to those questions
*"Some Texts Revealed by Bahá'u'lláh"
*''Synopsis and Codification of the Laws and Ordinances'', prepared by [[Shoghi Effendi]]
*explanatory notes prepared by the [[Universal House of Justice]]

The book was divided into six main themes in the ''Synopsis and Codification'' by Shoghi Effendi:
#The appointment of [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] as the successor of Bahá'u'lláh
#Anticipation of the Institution of the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardianship]]
#The Institution of the Universal House of Justice
#Laws, Ordinances and exhortations
#Specific admonitions, reproofs and warnings
#Miscellaneous subjects

Further, the laws were divided into four categories:
:A. Prayer
:B. Fasting
:C. Laws of personal status
:D. Miscellaneous laws, ordinances and exhortations

===Themes===
Scholarly review finds the Aqdas has themes of laws of worship, societal relations and administrative organization, or governance, of the religion.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt; Through the authority vested in [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] in the Aqdas there is an expanse of [[Cosmopolitanism|internationalism]] related to the law in works like ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]'' and through his extended authority to [[Shoghi Effendi]] works like his ''[[World Order of Bahá'u'lláh]]'' further elaborates on the internationalism theme. This stands in some distinction from other scriptures by not using triumphal tones as the voice of God is given to be viewed but rather one of progressive development, social context, and outright delay in application until another day. Indeed, it insists that divine law is applicable only in situations with requisite conditions, where it is likely to have certain social effects. The goal of application of the law and its methods are not to cause disturbance and dissension and requires an appreciation for context and intention. Additionally one is to eschew emphasis in the development of [[textualist]] and [[intentionalist]] arguments about the law though some of this is visible in scholarship on the Aqdas. Such methods of application of law in a religious context are, in the opinion of Roshan Danish, common in Islam and Judaism.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt;

The Aqdas is understood by Bahá'ís to be a factor in the process of ongoing developments in world order. This can be seen comparing the Bahá'í approach to history and the future to that of the theory of [[The Clash of Civilizations]] on the one hand and the development of a [[posthegemony]] system on the other (compared with work of Robert Cox, for example, in ''Approaches to World Order'', (Robert Cox &amp; Timonthy Sinclair eds, Cambridge University Press, 1996).)&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt;

Certain possible sources of law are specifically abrogated: laws of the Bábí religion, notably in the ''[[Persian Bayán]]'', oral traditions (linked with [[Bahá'í literature#Authenticity and authority|pilgrim notes]], and natural law, (that is to say God's sovereign will through revelation is the independent authority.)&lt;ref name="JLR18-3"/&gt; Divine revelation's law-making is both unconditioned in terms of the divine right to choose, and conditioned in the sense of the progress of history from one revelation to the next.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JLR18-3"/&gt;

====Laws of personal status====

=====Marriage and divorce=====
{{main|Bahá'í marriage}}
Baha'u'llah's statements about marriage in the ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' are brief. Marriage is highly recommended but is stated to not be obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=marriage |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=232–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'u'lláh states that the maximum number of wives is two, but also states that having only one wife would add more tranquility to both partners.&lt;ref name="polygamy"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=Polygamy |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; These statements were later interpreted by [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] that having a second wife is conditional upon treating both wives with justice and equality and was not possible in practice, thus establishing monogamy.&lt;ref name="polygamy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge205"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |year=2008 |title=An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-86251-5 |location=Cambridge |page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JLR18-m"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=Udo |title=An Introduction to Baha'i Law: Doctrinal Foundations, Principles and Structures |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=321, 333 |year=2002–2003 |jstor=1602268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That [[Bahá'u'lláh]] had three wives,&lt;ref name="polygamy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his religion teaches monogamy, which has been the subject of criticism. The writing of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and Bahá'í teachings on gender equality and monogamy post-date Bahá'u'lláh's marriages and are understood to be evolutionary in nature, slowly leading Bahá'ís away from what had been a deeply rooted cultural practice.&lt;ref name="polygamy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JLR18-m"/&gt;

====Administration====
{{main|Bahá'í administration}}
The institutional status of the authority of 'Abdu'l-Bahá and a House of Justice are specifically delineated.&lt;ref name="JLR19-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JLR18-3"/&gt; On the basis of the authority granted 'Abdu'l-Bahá he extended forms of the authority vested in him to the Guardianship, whose sole member was Shoghi Effendi, and the Universal, or International, House of Justice through his [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]]. This was confirmed and amplified in other texts, notably the [[Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh#Kit.C3.A1b-i-.60Ahd|Kitáb-i-'Ahd]]. The Universal House of Justice is specifically empowered to write and rescind any laws it is felt necessary aside from those of the text of scripture and actual application of the laws of the Aqdas among Bahá'ís are dependent on the choice of the Universal House of Justice.&lt;ref name="JLR18-3"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4169">The famous open '''''Letter to King [[Henry II of France]]''''' by [[Nostradamus]] is his dedicatory preface to the now-missing 1558 edition of his ''Propheties'', as reprinted in the posthumous 1568 edition by Benoist Rigaud. After a formal introduction, it makes various claims about the sources of his inspiration and lists many cryptic prophecies (nearly all undated) that seemingly have little to do with those in the work itself. These include:

* decadence and calamity threatening both [[Christian Church|Church]] and [[laity]]
* the advent of French rulers who will cause [[Europe]] to tremble
* the amalgamating of kingdoms and propagation of new laws
* the confrontation of [[England]] and a bloody invasion of [[Italy]]
* new alliances between [[Rome]], [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Spain]]
* the liberation of [[Sicily]] from the Germans
* the persecution of the [[Arabs]] by the [[Latin nations]]
* the advent of the [[Antichrist]] like [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] and his hosts
* attacks by the Muslims on the [[Pope]] and his Church
* an [[eclipse]] of unprecedented darkness
* a great October upheaval lasting 73 years and seven months
* renewal of the Church by one from the 50th degree of latitude
* an attempt by peoples to free themselves which will result in even greater imprisonment
* the advent of the Great Dog and an even Greater Mastiff
* the rebuilding of the churches and restoration of the [[priesthood]]
* a new disaster, with crooked leaders and generals who will be disarmed by a sceptical populace
* a new military and regal saviour ruling from another 'little [[Mesopotamia]]'
* the putting down of a former tyranny by a conspiracy
* a powerful resurgence of [[Islam]], with Western [[Christendom]] in decay and decline
* an unprecedented persecution of the Church, with two thirds of the population wiped out by [[Infectious disease|pestilence]]
* desolation of the country and clergy, while the invading Arab military take over [[Malta]], [[Mediterranean]] [[France]] and the offshore islands
* a Western counterinvasion that will rescue Spain from the invaders and pursue the Arabs back to the [[Middle East]]
* the depopulation of [[Israel]], with the [[Holy Sepulchre]] turned into farm buildings
* terrible retribution inflicted on the Orientals by the Northerners, whose tongues will have acquired an [[Arabic]] admixture
* defeat of the Eastern leaders and seven-year triumph of the Northern [[Christians]]
* the persecution of Christians until 1792, when a totally new era will begin
* an extremely powerful [[Venice]]
* vast naval battles in the [[Adriatic]], destruction of many cities and persecution of the Church and Pope
* a brief reign for the Antichrist, with a huge liberating army led into Italy by a 'Gallic [[Hercules]]'
* vast floods wiping out the very knowledge of letters
* universal peace toward the beginning of the seventh millennium after the [[Creation according to Genesis|Creation]], and restoration of the Holy Sepulchre
* some great conflagration
* restoration of the [[papacy]]
* sacking of the [[Holy of Holies]] by [[paganism|pagans]] and destruction of the [[scriptures]]
* the reign of the Prince of Hell for 25 years after the Antichrist
* premonitory birds
* a new [[Golden Age]] of [[Saturn]], the binding of [[Satan]] for a thousand years, and universal peace and harmony, with the Church finally triumphant

The letter also includes two different dates for the creation of the world.

This is a list of [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], [[Christian Universalism|Universalist]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] churches.  Various congregations (churches, societies, fellowships, etc.) and/or individual churches as buildings, of these related religious groups have historic or other significance.

Numerous Unitarian churches are notable for having historic buildings, and there are former church buildings that are historic, too.  There are numerous Unitarian churches that are [[listed buildings]] in England, that are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in the United States, or that are noted on other historic registers.

This article includes churches notable either as congregations or as buildings or as both.

'''Mabel McKay''' (1907–1993) was a member of the Long Valley Cache Creek [[Pomo people|Pomo]] Indians and was of [[Patwin people|Patwin]] descent. She was the last Dreamer of the Pomo people and a basket making prodigy.

[[Greg Sarris]] published a biography of Mabel, called ''Weaving the Dream'' (University of California Press, 1997), which follows Mabel’s way of storytelling – a meandering one which describes her work as a dreamer, doctor, and basket weaver.

==Life as doctor and weaver==
Mabel McKay was born on 12 January 1907 in [[Nice, California|Nice]] in [[Lake County, California]]. Her father was Yanta Boone (Potter Valley Pomo) and her mother was Daisy Hansen (Lolsel Cache Creek Pomo).&lt;ref&gt;Luthin, 324&lt;/ref&gt; Raised by her maternal grandmother, Sarah Taylor, Mabel was described as an unusually quiet little girl. She was considered a sickly child whom talked in her sleep and often woke screaming from dreams. Sarah, her grandmother, remembers hearing Mabel mumble in her sleep. Sarah knew what was happening to Mabel, she understood that she was Dreaming. As she grew older, Mabel would sometimes sleep for days and Sarah Taylor would have a hard time waking her up. Spirit would talk to Mabel in her dreams telling her necessary steps to take in order to fulfill her role as a doctor. Like a shaman, Mabel was a medium between the spiritual and the real world.

Mabel was taught by Spirit in her Dreaming to be a doctor and a basket weaver. Spirit taught Mabel how to suck sickness from the ill with her mouth and spit it out into her baskets. Spirit taught Mabel certain songs to put sicknesses to sleep, songs which Mabel would not remember after singing them. Mabel had to work with an interpreter who thoroughly understood her language and could translate to the people what she was saying in her songs.

==Baskets==
During her Dreaming she was told that her baskets would come from Spirit that she would be famous for them, and people would offer a lot of money for them. Spirit directed her on each basket she wove. Mabel used prayer as a way of communicating to Spirit, and in return Spirit showed Mabel what to make for each person. Each of her baskets had a purpose. Each had a rule. Many people could not understand her process but Mabel was successful in explaining that her baskets are living, not just pretty things to look at.

Mabel was a well-respected scholar. She spoke at universities and served as a cultural consultant for anthropologists. She spoke at [[the New School]] in [[New York City|New York]] with [[Essie Pinola Parrish|Essie Parrish]] on March 14, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a weaver her skill and attention to detail brought worldwide recognition to her basketry. Her baskets are shown in many museum collections in the U.S. and abroad. Weaving for Mabel was a spiritual path, not a craft. She was never 'taught' to weave a basket. Instead she was strictly instructed by Spirit as a Dreamer.

==Dreamer==
Mabel not only healed people but brought a whole community together. Through her dreaming and the resurgence of old traditions Mabel encouraged people living in the present to appreciate their culture, to embrace it and to celebrate their heritage. Dreamers renew a tribe’s history and culture, and Mabel was the last of the dreamers to pass on that legacy of Pomo Indian customs.

'''Malcolm Frederick''' "'''Mal'''" '''Evans''' (27 May 1935 – 5 January 1976) was the [[roadie]], the [[personal assistant|assistant]], and a friend of [[the Beatles]].

In the early 1960s, Evans was employed as a [[BT Group|telephone engineer]], and also worked part-time as a [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] at the [[Cavern Club]]. The Beatles' manager, [[Brian Epstein]], later hired Evans as the group's assistant [[roadie]], in tandem with [[Neil Aspinall]]. [[Peter Brown (music industry)|Peter Brown]] (one of Epstein's staff) later wrote that Evans was "a kindly, but menacing-looking young man". Evans contributed to recordings, and appeared in some of the films the group made. After The Beatles stopped touring in 1966, Evans carried on assisting them until their break-up in 1970. From 1969, Evans also found work as a record producer (most notably with [[Badfinger]]'s top 10 hit "[[No Matter What (Badfinger song)|No Matter What]]").

Evans was killed by police on 5 January 1976, at his home in [[Los Angeles]]. Officers were called when his girlfriend phoned the police and told them that Evans was confused and had a gun. The police mistook the [[air rifle]] Evans was holding for a rifle and shot him dead.

== Early life ==
&lt;!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted --&gt;
Details of Evans' early life are unknown, apart from his birth date. No book has been written about him, although he wrote his memoirs, ''Living The Beatles' Legend'', from which extracts were released on 20 March 2005.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=601}}&lt;ref name="MalEvansDiaryExtracts"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article424669.ece |title=Mal Evans' diary extracts |publisher=''[[The Times]]'' |date=20 March 2005 |accessdate=27 May 2011 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is known about him starts in 1961, when Evans married a Liverpool girl, Lily, after meeting her at a [[funfair (disambiguation)|funfair]] in [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]] opposite Liverpool on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]]. Their first child, Gary, was born in the same year.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep1"/&gt; The Beatles were the resident group at [[Liverpool]]'s [[Cavern Club]] when Evans first heard them perform during his lunch break. He was then living in Hillside Road, [[Mossley Hill]] and working as a telephone engineer for the [[Royal Mail|Post Office]].&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article424674.ece |title=Here, there and everywhere |date=20 March 2005 |page=1 |first=Mark |last=Edmonds |publisher=''The Times'' |accessdate=27 May 2011 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ingham|2003|p=20}} He became a committed fan, even though his musical hero at the time was [[Elvis Presley]].&lt;ref name="Portfolio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beatlesagain.com/bmal.html |title=Mal Evans Portfolio |publisher=The Internet Beatles Album |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He first befriended [[George Harrison]], who put forward Evans' name to the Cavern Club's manager, [[Ray McFall]], when he needed a [[bouncer (doorman)|doorman]].&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep1"/&gt; The 27-year-old Evans was accepted, even though he wore thick-framed [[glasses]], but mainly because of his burly 6&amp;nbsp;ft 6in frame (1.97 m), which was an asset when holding back unruly fans at the Cavern's door.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep1"/&gt; He was later nicknamed the "Gentle Giant" and "Big Mal".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=93}}{{sfn|Ingham|2003|p=301}} In 1962, Evans wrote that it was "a wonderful year", as he had Lily (his wife), his son Gary, a house, a car, and he was working at the Cavern Club, which he wrote into a 1963 Post Office Engineering Union diary, which also had information concerning [[Ohm's law]] and Post Office pay rates.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep1"/&gt;

[[Image:Aspinall and Evans.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Neil Aspinall]] and Evans in 1963]]
On 11 August 1963, Evans began working for the Beatles in the combined role of roadie/bodyguard.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=92}}&lt;ref name="MilesBeatlesDiary"&gt;Miles, Charlesworth (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Evans and Aspinall's duties were to drive the van while on tour, and to set up and test the [[Vox (musical equipment)|equipment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memb.nl/ memb.nl - Photo of Evans backstage] memb Retrieved 26 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Mal's telephone engineering experience was valuable in setting up and maintaining the electrical equipment. The Beatles were being driven back to Liverpool from London by Evans through heavy fog on 21 January 1963, when the windscreen was hit by a pebble and crazed over, so Evans had to break a large hole in it to see the road ahead.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep1"/&gt; This was in winter, so the group had to lie one on top of the other in the back with a bottle of whisky and try to stay warm in the freezing temperatures; something McCartney later referred to as a "Beatle sandwich".&lt;ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD"&gt;''The Beatles Anthology'' DVD 2003 (Episode 2 – 0:15:41) McCartney, Harrison and Starr talking about the broken window in Aspinall's van.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Evans had many other duties: as well as acting as a bodyguard, he was sent to buy anything they needed, such as suits, boots, meals, or drinks.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=92–93}} If Lennon said "Socks, Mal", Evans would have to rush to a local store and buy pairs of cotton socks for him.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article424674.ece?token=null&amp;offset=12&amp;page=2|title=Here, there and everywhere|date=20 March 2005|page=2|last=Edmonds|first=Mark|work=The Times|accessdate=27 May 2011| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Evans wrote in his diaries that he "bought Ringo [Starr] some [[underpants|undies]] for his visit to the doctor".&lt;ref name="MalEvansDiaryExtracts" /&gt; Although Beatles' memorabilia are in continuous demand, a full set of autographs by all four could be [[forgery|forgeries]]: Evans and Aspinall used to sign many of them when Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr were too busy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heard|first=Chris|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3580794.stm|title=Beware of Beatles 'bargains'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=27 May 2004|date=20 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beatles started their first European tour in January 1964, and Evans was allowed to take his wife and son with him, but was involved in a "big punch-up" with photographers in [[Paris]] while protecting them.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep2"/&gt;
Epstein's associate, [[Alistair Taylor]], once asked him why he was driving an [[Austin Princess]] limousine, rather than a [[Daimler Company|Daimler]], a [[Bentley]], or a [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]]. Evans explained that The Beatles were forced to choose an Austin, because they had tested every car to see how wide the doors would open as they (literally) had to "dive into the car" to escape their fans.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=445}}

=== America and the Philippines ===
&lt;!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted --&gt;
The Beatles were introduced to [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] by [[Bob Dylan]] in [[New York City]] in 1964. McCartney remembered asking Evans "again and again" to write down his newly found cannabis-influenced thoughts about life by repeating "Get [write] it down, Mal, get it down!"{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=188-189}} Evans was as affected by the drug as everybody else, so took a very long time to find a pencil and a piece of paper.{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=145}} The next morning Evans gave the sheet of paper to McCartney, which read that McCartney had dictated: "There are seven levels!" (of life, as he later explained).{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=188–189}} The Beatles attended "The Night of 100 Stars" at the [[London Palladium]] on 23 July 1964, and during the show Evans constantly supplied them with whisky and Coca-Cola, which he delivered to them balanced on a wooden oar he had found backstage.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=515–516}}

The Beatles were always assisted by Evans on their American tours, and when they played two shows at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in the summer of 1965 Epstein arranged for them all to have a four-day rest in a luxurious horseshoe-shaped house on stilts in [[Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, California|Benedict Canyon]] off [[Mulholland Drive]] in Los Angeles. They spent their time there smoking cannabis joints. Evans and Lennon swam in the large outdoor swimming pool with cigarettes in their mouths, to see who could keep them alight the longest.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=579}} After recording sessions in London, Lennon, Harrison, and Starr would be chauffeured back to their houses in the "stockbroker belt" of southern England, but Evans, Aspinall, and McCartney would drive to a late-night club to eat steak, chips, and [[mushy peas]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=166–167}} [[The Bag O'Nails]] nightclub was one of their favourites, at 8 [[Kingly Street]] in [[Soho]], London, as it also presented live music.&lt;ref name="Nails"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revolverbook.co.uk/beatleslondon.html|title=The Beatles' London, 1965–66|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=141}} In his memoirs Evans wrote: 19 January and 20: "Ended up [[drunk|smashed]] in Bag O'Nails with Paul [McCartney] and Neil [Aspinall]. Quite a number of people attached themselves, oh that it would happen to me... freak out time baby for Mal."&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep2"/&gt;

In July 1966, The Beatles toured the [[Philippines]], and unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, [[Imelda Marcos]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=619}} After the supposed snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to [[Manila]] airport on their own. At the airport, road manager Evans was beaten and kicked, and the group members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=623}} Once the group boarded the plane, [[Tony Barrow]] and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, "Tell Lil I love her," thinking he was about to be jailed or killed.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=624}} Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the group had earned while they were there before being allowed on the plane.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=625}}

The Beatles' last concert was at [[Candlestick Park]], [[San Francisco]], on 29 August 1966, but Evans continued to work for them in the studio, and to run errands. After recording ''[[Revolver (The Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' in 1966, McCartney went by himself on holiday to France, but asked to meet Evans in [[Bordeaux]], at the Grosse Horloge church (on the corner of cours Victor Hugo and rue St. James).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multimap.com/maps/?zoom=17&amp;countryCode=FR&amp;lat=44.83522&amp;lon=-0.57093|title=Location of the Grosse Horloge, Bordeaux|publisher=Multimap|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At exactly the pre-arranged time of one o'clock, Evans was standing under the church clock when McCartney arrived.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=302}} They then drove to [[Madrid]] together, but after feeling bored, McCartney phoned Epstein's office in London and asked to be booked on a [[safari holidays|safari holiday]] in [[Kenya]]. When they arrived they visited the [[Amboseli Reserve]] at the foot of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], and also stayed at the exclusive [[Treetops Hotel]], where the rooms are built on the branches of trees.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=302}}

They spent their final night in [[Nairobi]] at a [[YMCA]], before they returned to London. The Beatles—according to McCartney—needed a new name, so on the flight back to England, Evans and McCartney played with words to see if they could come up with something new. Evans innocently asked McCartney what the letters "S" and "P" stood for on the pots on their meal trays, and McCartney explained that it was for salt and pepper, which led to the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' name.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=303–304}} They arrived back in London on 19 November 1966.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=303}} Before the cover of ''Sgt. Pepper'' could be completed by [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], Evans and Aspinall were sent out to find photographs of all of the people that were to be shown on the front cover.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=336}}

In the spring of 1967—after the album was completed—Evans flew with McCartney to Los Angeles to see McCartney's then-girlfriend, [[Jane Asher]], who was acting there with the [[Old Vic]] theatre company. The three of them went on a trip to the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], returning to LA in [[Frank Sinatra]]'s jet. Evans: "We left [[Denver]] in Frank Sinatra's [[Lear Jet]], which he very kindly loaned us. A beautiful job with dark black leather upholstery and, to our delight, a well-stocked bar."&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article424674.ece?token=null&amp;offset=24&amp;page=3|title=Here, there and everywhere|date=20 March 2005|page=3|first=Mark|last=Edmonds|work=The Times|accessdate=27 May 2011| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they were back in LA, they were invited to visit the house of Michelle and John Phillips, from [[the Mamas &amp; the Papas]].&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep2"/&gt; [[Brian Wilson]] was also there, as he was working on [[the Beach Boys]]' [[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|''Smile'']] album. Evans wrote about singing "[[On Top of Old Smokey]]" with McCartney and Wilson, but was not impressed by Wilson's avant-garde attitude to music: "Brian [Wilson] then put a damper on the spontaneity of the whole affair by walking in with a tray of water-filled glasses, trying to arrange it into some sort of session."&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep3"/&gt;

=== Greece and the ''Magical Mystery Tour'' ===
&lt;!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted --&gt;
The Beatles and Evans flew to Greece in late 1967, with encouragement from Greek-born [[Alex Mardas (Magic Alex)|"Magic Alex"]], the director of [[Apple Electronics]], to buy an island or a group of islands.&lt;ref name="CampbellNewStatesman3August1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Duncan|authorlink=Duncan Campbell (investigative journalist)|journal=[[New Statesman]]|date=3 August 1979|pages=158–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general idea was that The Beatles would live on the islands in their own separate homes, but would be connected to each other by tunnels leading to a central dome. Evans and his family were included in the plan, but it was abandoned as being unworkable after McCartney refused to participate.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=704}} As McCartney had no housekeeper in 1967, Evans moved in with him at 7 Cavendish Avenue, [[St John's Wood]], which is near [[Abbey Road Studios]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=166–167}} It was at Cavendish Avenue that McCartney bought his first [[Old English Sheepdog]], Martha, although Evans often complained about the dog fouling the beds.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep2"/&gt; Evans later bought a house in [[Sunbury-on-Thames]], which was situated between McCartney's, Lennon's, Harrison's and Starr's houses.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep2"/&gt;

While working on the ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'' film, Evans wrote about his work duties: "I would get requests from the four of them to do six different things at one time, and it was always a case of relying on instinct and experience in awarding priorities. They used to be right [[Sod (word)|sods]] for the first few days, until they realised that everything was going to go smoothly and they could get into the routine of recording. ... Then I would find time between numerous cups of tea and salad sandwiches and baked beans on toast to listen to the recording in the control room."&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep3"/&gt;

After the ''Magical Mystery Tour'' recordings, Evans flew to [[Nice]] with McCartney to shoot "[[The Fool on the Hill]]" promotional film, although McCartney set off without luggage or a passport.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep3"/&gt; McCartney got past customs by saying "You know who I am", but he and Evans were not allowed into a hotel restaurant in Nice because they "didn't look the part", and had to eat dinner in Evans' room.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep3"/&gt; Because the money they had with them had been spent on clothes (NEMS was supposed to send them more), they arranged for credit over two nights in a nightclub. Evans: "We took advantage of our credit standing, as money had still not arrived from England. News about Paul's [McCartney] visit to the club the previous night had spread, and the place was jammed. Now Paul, being a generous sort of person, had built up quite a bar bill, when the manager of the club arrived demanding that we pay immediately. On explaining who Paul was and what had happened, he answered, 'You either pay the bill, or I call the police.' It certainly looked like we were going to get thrown in jail. It was ironical, sitting in a club with a millionaire, unable to pay the bill."&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep3"/&gt;

=== India and Apple ===

{{main|The Beatles at Rishikesh}}
The Beatles flew to India in February 1968, to visit the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]'s [[ashram]] (after first meeting him on 24 August 1967, at the [[London Hilton on Park Lane|London Hilton]] hotel).&lt;ref name="MalEvansDiaryExtracts"/&gt; Evans arrived in India a few days earlier to inspect the ashram, but as soon as Starr got off the plane, he demanded that Evans find a doctor, as his inoculation shots were causing him pain. Evans: "When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him [Starr], to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.' So off we go to pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say 'It will be all right'."&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep3"/&gt; Evans wrote in his diary on 17 February 1968: "The [[Mass media|press]] really tried kicking down the gates into the Ashram, the Indian people on the Ashram called me half way through, but as soon as an Indian reporter told me "No bloody foreigner is going to stop me in my own country", I cooled it."&lt;ref name="MalEvansDiaryExtracts"/&gt; Evans' diary says that he enjoyed his time in India: "It's hard to believe that a week has already passed. I suppose the peace of mind and the serenity one achieves through meditation makes the time fly," and that he also enjoyed the food, unlike Starr, who had brought a suitcase full of baked beans with him.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep3"/&gt; After leaving India, Harrison and Evans flew to New York, visiting Bob Dylan and [[The Band]], who were rehearsing at their [[Big Pink]] house/studio, in Woodstock.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article424674.ece?token=null&amp;offset=36&amp;page=4|title=Here, there and everywhere|date=20 March 2005|page=4|first=Mark|last=Edmonds|work=The Times|accessdate=27 May 2011| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Apple Corps|Apple]] was formed in 1968, Evans was promoted from road manager to [[personal assistant]], although his weekly [[£]]38 salary remained the same.
After Mal and [[Peter Asher]] (A&amp;R head of Apple Records) saw the rock band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal constantly suggested that the Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: "January 13, 1969: Paul [McCartney] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [Evans was made MD of Apple, but very briefly] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other people in my relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt like one of the family. Seems I fetch and carry. I find it difficult to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and are still going to ask for a rise. I always tell myself—look, everybody wants to take from, be satisfied, try to give and you will receive. After all this time I have about £70 to my name, but was content and happy. Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?"&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep4"/&gt; Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: "April 24: "Had to tell George [Harrison]—'I'm broke'. Really miserable and down because I'm in the red, and the bills are coming in, poor old Lil [his wife] suffers as I don't want to get a rise. Not really true don't want to ask for a rise, fellows are having a pretty tough time as it is."&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep5"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article424674.ece?token=null&amp;offset=48&amp;page=5|title=Here, there and everywhere|date=20 March 2005|page=5|last=Edmonds|first=Mark|work=The Times|accessdate=27 May 2011| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans was the only member of the Apple entourage to be invited to attend (and be a [[marriage|witness]]) when McCartney and [[Linda McCartney|Linda Eastman]] were married at [[Marylebone]] Registry Office on 12 March 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2029059.stm|title=McCartney: Then and now|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=10 June 2002|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans wrote in his diary that he was due to be there at 9.45&amp;nbsp;am, but McCartney's brother, [[Mike McGear|Michael]]'s train from [[Birmingham]] was late. [[Peter Brown (music industry)|Peter Brown]] and Evans passed the register office at 9.15, and saw that there were only a few photographers and ardent fans standing in the rain, but when they left, after the wedding at 11.30&amp;nbsp;am, they were mobbed by a crowd of about 1,000 people.&lt;ref name="MalEvansDiaryExtracts"/&gt; When the Beatles played on the roof of Apple's offices in Savile Row, Evans was told to delay the policemen (who had arrived to stop the concert), as long as was possible.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep4"/&gt;

Evans enjoyed an executive position at Apple until 1969, when [[Allen Klein]] was hired as a manager to reorganise the whole company. Evans was fired by Klein the next year, because Klein complained to Lennon that Aspinall and Evans were "living like kings; like fucking emperors". Evans was later reinstated after McCartney, Harrison and Starr complained.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=827}}{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=546}} On 13 September 1969, Evans accompanied Lennon, [[Yoko Ono]], [[Klaus Voorman]], [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]] and [[Eric Clapton]] to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, for the [[Toronto Rock and Roll Revival]] concert. He later wrote: "I was really enjoying myself. It was the first show I had roadied for three years and I was really loving every minute of plugging the amps in and setting them up on stage, making sure that everything was right. Everyone wanted the show to go particularly well because Allen Klein, who had flown over, had organised for the whole of John's performance to be filmed.

=== Musical contributions ===
&lt;!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted --&gt;
Evans contributed to many recordings,&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep1"/&gt; including singing in the chorus of "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]". He played single [[organ (music)|organ]] notes on "[[You Won't See Me]]",&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep1"/&gt; and [[harmonica]] on "[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]".&lt;ref name="helpfromhisroadiefriend"/&gt; McCartney explained that he showed Evans where the notes were on the organ, and then nodded his head when he wanted Evans to play, and shook it when he wanted him to stop.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=438}}

On "[[A Day in the Life]]", Evans controlled an [[alarm clock]]; counting the [[Bar (music)|measures]] in the original 24-bar pause,&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep2"/&gt; and was one of the five piano players simultaneously hitting the last chord of the song.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=438}} He played [[tambourine]] on "[[Dear Prudence]]", and [[trumpet]] on "[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]", where he played a double solo with Lennon, even though neither was proficient on the instrument.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=793}} Evans contributed background vocals, and stirred a bucket of [[gravel]] (as part of the rhythm), on "[[You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)]]".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=438}} He also contributed to the ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' out-take, "[[What's the New Mary Jane]]", and hit an [[anvil]] on "[[Maxwell's Silver Hammer]]",&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep1"/&gt;{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=438}}&lt;ref name="GeoffEmerickonAbbeyRoadp5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/beatles-engineer-geoff-emerick-on-abbey-road-219542/5|title=Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick on Abbey Road (p5)|first=Joe|last=Bosso|page=5|publisher=Music Radar|date=10 September 2009|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; because Starr could not lift the hammer high enough to get the right sound and keep in time with the song.&lt;ref name="GeoffEmerickonAbbeyRoadp5"/&gt;

According to Evans' diaries, he helped to compose songs for the ''Sgt. Pepper'' album.&lt;ref name="MalEvansDiaryExtracts"/&gt; He wrote, on 27 January 1967: "Sgt Pepper. Started writing song with Paul [McCartney] upstairs in his room, he on piano" and "Did a lot more of "where the rain comes in" [a lyric from "[[Fixing a Hole]]"]. Hope people like it. Started Sergeant Pepper".&lt;ref name="MalEvansDiaryExtracts"/&gt; On 1 February: "Sergeant Pepper sounds good. Paul tells me that I will get royalties on the song—great news, now perhaps a new home."&lt;ref name="MalEvansDiaryExtracts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="helpfromhisroadiefriend"/&gt; On 2 February: "Recording voices on Captain {{sic}} Pepper. All six of us doing the chorus in the middle, worked until about midnight."&lt;ref name="MalEvansDiaryExtracts"/&gt;

Keith Badman—author of ''The Beatles off the Record''—referred to a tape recording of Evans speaking shortly before his death, on which Evans reiterated some of the statements made in the diary. According to Badman, Evans was asked at the time if it would be a problem that he was not credited as a writer, because the [[Lennon–McCartney]] writing name was "a really hot item".&lt;ref name="helpfromhisroadiefriend"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/sitesearch.do?querystring=Mal+Evans&amp;p=tto&amp;pf=all&amp;bl=on|title=McCartney wrote Sgt Pepper 'with a little help from his roadie friend'|accessdate=27 May 2011|first=Maurice|last=Chittenden|work=The Times|location=London|date=20 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons unclear, Evans did not receive any royalties and stayed at his £38-a-week pay (£{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|38|1967}}}} in modern currency).&lt;ref name="helpfromhisroadiefriend"/&gt;

=== On film ===

Evans appeared in four (out of five) Beatles' films.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep1"/&gt; During the filming of the Beatles' first feature film, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', Evans appeared in a cameo role, carrying an upright bass in between John Lennon and Millie in the backstage scene in which Millie mistakes Lennon for someone else.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058182/trivia&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Help!

In the ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'' film, Evans can be seen playing the anvil during early versions of "[[Maxwell's Silver Hammer]]", and can be seen talking to police officers on the [[Savile Row]] rooftop when they came to stop the performance.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=438}} Before the concert, Evans placed a camera and a microphone in a corner of Apple's reception area, so that when the police came in to complain about the noise—which was expected—they could be filmed and recorded.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=816}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maccafan.net/Gallery/GetBackRehearsals/Rooftop.htm|title=The Rooftop Concert|publisher=maccafan.net|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beatles were often filmed by Evans during his time with them (without sound), and a collection of his own film recordings was later released on [[DVD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/movie/pid/6943272/a/Beatles+-+The+Complete+Mal+Evans+Silent+Films.htm|title=Beatles - The Complete Mal Evans Silent Films DVD|publisher=cduniverse.com|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Evans had seen the group [[Badfinger]] (then known as The Iveys) play live, and suggested that they be signed to Apple. Evans then produced several of their songs in 1969 and 1970, the most notable of which was "[[No Matter What (Badfinger song)|No Matter What]]", which charted on Billboard's Top 10 in December 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Mal+Evans|title=Mal Evans |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans also discovered the group [[Splinter (band)|Splinter]] and brought them to the Apple label, although they would subsequently move to George Harrison's [[Dark Horse Records]].&lt;ref name="SplinterBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splinterlibrary.com/|title=Splinter|first=Tom|last=Brennan|publisher=Splinter Library|date=13 November 2011|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans' other production credits include [[Jackie Lomax]]' 1969 single "New Day" (on Apple) and some of the tracks on [[Keith Moon]]'s only solo album ''[[Two Sides of the Moon]]'' (1975).&lt;ref name="amg-moon"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r45017/credits|pure_url=yes}} |title=Credits for "Two Sides of the Moon" |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans separated from his wife in 1973 and moved to [[Los Angeles]] where Lennon had moved to live with [[May Pang]] after his own separation from [[Yoko Ono]]. Evans is credited on Harrison's ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' and the ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'' album as providing "tea and sympathy".&lt;ref name="Love"&gt;{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Cadogan |url=http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/lennonlove.html |title=The Making of John Lennon's "Love" |publisher=Abbeyrd's Beatle Page |date=19 August 2008 |accessdate=27 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604213644/http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/lennonlove.html |archivedate=4 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans cowrote "[[You and Me (Babe)]]" with Harrison. The track appeared on Starr's 1973 solo album ''[[Ringo (album)|Ringo]]''.{{sfn|Leng|2002|p=105}} He also cowrote the Splinter song "Lonely Man", the musical centrepiece of ''[[Little Malcolm]]'', an [[Apple Films|Apple]] feature film produced by Harrison. A rare interview appearance by Evans was included in the 1975 ABC television special ''[[A Salute to the Beatles: Once upon a Time|David Frost Salutes the Beatles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Badman|first=Keith|title=The Beatles Diary Volume 2: After the Break-Up 1970–2001|publisher= Omnibus Press|location=London|year=2001|isbn=978-0-7119-8307-6|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans was asked to produce the group Natural Gas,{{sfn|Badman|2000|p=183}} and was working on a book of memoirs called ''Living The Beatles' Legend'' which he was due to deliver to his publishers, [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], on 12 January 1976. Evans was depressed about the separation from his wife (who had asked for a [[divorce]] before [[Christmas]]) even though he was then living with his new girlfriend, Fran Hughes, in a rented motel apartment at 8122 West 4th Street in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=601}}&lt;ref name="LAPDSHOT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feelnumb.com/?p=839 |title=Beatles' Roadie Shot by LAPD Here (photo of house) |publisher=Feel Numb |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
&lt;!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted --&gt;
On 5 January 1976, Evans was so despondent that Hughes phoned Evans' cowriter for his biography, John Hoernie, and asked him to visit them. Hoernie saw Evans "really doped-up and groggy" but Evans told Hoernie to make sure he finished ''Living The Beatles' Legend''.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=601}} Hoernie helped Evans up to an upstairs bedroom, but during an incoherent conversation, Evans picked up an air rifle. Hoernie struggled with Evans, but Evans, being much stronger, held onto the weapon.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=601}}

Hughes then phoned the police and told them that Evans was confused, had a rifle,&lt;ref name="helpfromhisroadiefriend"/&gt; and was on [[valium]]. Four policemen arrived and three of them, David D. Krempa, Robert E. Brannon and Lieutenant Higbie, went up to the bedroom.{{sfn|Huntley|2004|p=139}} They later reported that as soon as Evans saw the three policemen he pointed a rifle at them.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=600}} The officers repeatedly told Evans to put down the rifle (which they did not know at the time was an air rifle) but Evans constantly refused.&lt;ref name="LosAngelesTimes5January1976"&gt;''Los Angeles Times'' (5 January 1976) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The police fired six shots, four hitting Evans and killing him.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=601-602}} Evans had previously been awarded the badge of "Honorary [[Sheriff]] of [[Los Angeles County]]",{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=601}} but in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', he was referred to as a "jobless former road manager for the Beatles".&lt;ref name="LosAngelesTimes5January1976"/&gt;

Evans was cremated on 7 January 1976, in Los Angeles. None of the former Beatles attended his funeral, but [[Harry Nilsson]] and other friends did. [[George Harrison]] arranged for Evans' family to receive £5,000, as Evans had not maintained his life insurance premiums, and was not entitled to a pension.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep5"/&gt;  
When Evans' ashes were sent by post back to England, they were misplaced and lost in the postal system but were eventually returned to his family. Upon learning of the lost remains, John Lennon reportedly joked by saying, "They should look in the dead letter file."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite blog|url=http://www.feelnumb.com/2009/07/12/mal-evans-the-beatles-roadie-was-shot-by-lapd-here|title=Mal Evans the Beatles Roadie Shot By LAPD|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, a trunk containing Evans' diaries and other effects was found in the basement of a New York publisher, and then sent to his family in London.&lt;ref name="HerethereandeverywhereTimep1"/&gt; In 1992, Lennon's original pages of lyrics to "[[A Day in the Life]]" were sold by the Evans estate for £56,600 at [[Sotheby's]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4623524.stm|title=Lennon original lyrics for sale|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=18 January 2006|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, a double-sided sheet of paper containing the hand-written lyrics and notes to "A Day in the Life" were sold at auction at Sotheby's in New York to an anonymous American buyer for $1.2m (£810,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8749106.stm|title=John Lennon's A Day in the Life lyrics sell for $1.2m|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=18 June 2010|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other lyrics collected by Evans have been subject to legal action over the years: In 1996, McCartney went to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in England and prevented the sale of the original lyrics to "[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]" that Evans' ex-wife had tried to sell, by claiming that the lyrics were collected by Evans as a part of his duties, and therefore belonged to The Beatles, collectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/147112.stm|title=Beatles songbook up for sale|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=7 August 1998|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 report of the discovery of a further collection of Evans's Beatles' memorabilia proved to be false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3579976.stm |title=Beatles suitcase 'full of fakes' |first= |last= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=27 May 2011 | date=19 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notebook in which McCartney wrote the lyrics for "[[Hey Jude]]" was sold in 1998, for £111,500. The notebook also contains lyrics for "Sgt.

The '''Manusela''' or '''Wahai''' people has a population of over 10,100 is centered in the Manusela mountains of North [[Seram]], [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]], [[Indonesia]].
They are also found along [[Teluti Bay]] in south Seram,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Cort Haddon &amp; James Hornell|title=Canoes of Oceania, Issues 28-29|year=1975|publisher=Bishop Museum Press|isbn=|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests their name of their tribe.

The Manusela follows the syncretic faith of Naurus, which might have come from the [[Toraja | Aluk' To Dolo]] faith. The Naurus faith is a combination of [[Hinduism]] and [[Animism]], but in recent years they also have adopted certain [[Protestant]] principles. A few Manusela have also adopted Protestantism as well. Not much is known about their religion, except that their religion may include worshipping of [[Hindu]] and Animist gods, with this influence coming from the [[Mindanao]] during the early periods, and presence of [[Hinduism]] is evidenced from the fact that archaeologists have found several statues of [[Hindu]] gods in Mindanao. The [[Nuaulu]] tribe, who lived in 10 villages northwest of the Manusela, were similar to the Manusela in language, had a population of 400 also follow the Naurus religion, but they were less influenced by Protestantism. The [[Nuaulu people]] also practice the Naurus faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shiv Shanker Tiwary &amp; Rajeev Kumar|title=Encyclopaedia of Southeast Asia and Its Tribes, Volume 1|year=2009|publisher=Anmol Publications|isbn=81-261-3837-8|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manusela people, often mistakenly thought as the [[Nuaulu]] people, wear a traditional red cloth on their head just like the [[Nuaulu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Indonesia.

'''Mount Heng''', also known by its Chinese name '''Hengshan''', is a mountain in north-central China's [[Shanxi Province]], known as the northern mountain of the [[Sacred Mountains of China|Five Great Mountains of China]]. Heng Shan in Shanxi Province is sometimes known as the '''Northern Heng Shan''', and the one in Hunan Province as [[Mount Heng (Hunan)|Southern Heng Shan]]. Both mountains have the same pronunciation in Chinese, and the Southern Heng Shan is also one of the Five Sacred Mountains.

==History==
Like the other mountains in [[China]] with strong Taoist presence, Heng Shan has been considered a sacred mountain since the [[Zhou Dynasty]]. Due to its northerly location, often under control of non-Chinese nations, the mountain has a weaker history of pilgrimage than its four fellows.  Indeed, to this day it is the least-visited and least-developed of the five, also the smallest in area. Because of this, [[Hengshan District, Jixi|Hengshan]] is not nearly as religiously important in China as the other Taoist mountains.&lt;ref name="Goosseart"&gt;Goosseart (2008), p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt;  But as a further consequence, it is also less commercialized -- there are no hotels on the mountain, for instance. The main peak is a lovely hike of around three hours round trip from the parking lot (a few miles up the mountain from where you buy the ticket), with the summit covered in fragrant lilac blossoms in June, and temples set into the cliffs. The slopes are largely covered with hemlocks, pines, elm, fir, poplar, and hawthorn, in the barer areas.

==Temples==
During the [[Han Dynasty]], a temple called the [[Shrine of the Northern Peak]] (Beiyue Miao), dedicated to the mountain god was built on Hengshan's slopes. While periodically destroyed and rebuilt, this temple has an uninterrupted history from Han times to the present day.&lt;ref name="Goosseart"/&gt; During times of occupation by non-Han Chinese people, worship to Hengshan was done at the [[Beiyue Temple]] in [[Quyang]].

Another temple of the area is the famous [[Hanging Temple]], built more than 1,500 years ago into a cliff near the Mount.

During this period he started welfare initiatives such as 'samaj-vivah' (low budget marriage) and bhaiyya education. He was against the [[caste system]] and throughout his life he fought for the right of the poor and farmers. He taught them to avoid extra expenses incurred in traditional marriage ceremonies and festivals, he also advised them to avoid taking loans and also emphasized the importance of education for social development.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3631">'''Pauline Wengeroff''' (1833–1916), born ''Pessele Epstein'' is the author of a two-volume memoir chronicling her experience of Jewish Modernity in [[Russia]] in the late 19th century. She was born in 1833 in [[Bobrujsk]], Belorussia (currently [[Belarus]]), and grew up in Brest-Litovsk, in [[Minsk]]. The book, ''Memoiren einer Grossmutter, Bilder aus der Kulturgeschichte der Juden Russlands im 19 Jahrhundert'' (''Memoirs of a Grandmother: Scenes from the Cultural History of the Jews of Russia in the Nineteenth Century''), was originally published in [[Yiddish]] by a German press in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/wengeroff-pauline Magnus, Shulamit S. "Pauline Wengeroff 1833-1916." Jewish Women's Archive.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband, Chonon (Afansyi) Wengeroff was director of the Commercial Bank in [[Minsk]] and served the City Council from 1880 to 1892. Wengeroff and her husband founded vocational schools for poor Jewish children in Minsk.

==Writing==
Wengeroff's memoirs are critical of the loss of women's power and family values in the modern Jewish family leading to the loss of Jewish culture as a whole. She was critical of the era of the [[Haskalah]] movement (Jewish intellectual and social enlightenment). Wengeroff drew inspiration from her struggles to maintain in Jewish family life in the face of her husband and children's ultimate rejection of Judaism.

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Wengeroff_Pauline Magnus, Shulamit S. "Wengeroff, Pauline." in YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Jewish cultural leaders [[Gustav Karpeles]], a Jewish literary historian, [[Theodor Zlocisti]], a German Zionist pioneer, and [[Solomon Schechter]], President of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] praised the memoir.

Wengeroff's work first appeared in English in Lucy Dawidowicz's translation of several discontinuous excerpts from ''Volume 2 in The Golden Tradition: Jewish Life and Thought in Eastern Europe. New York: 1976.'' ''Memoirs of a Grandmother,'' was translated into English by Shulamit S. Magnus in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Wengeroff, Pauline, and Shulamit S. Magnus. 2010. ''Memoirs of a grandmother scenes from the cultural history of the Jews of Russia in the nineteenth century''. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wengeroff also published stories of her life in ''Voshkhod'', a major Russian-language Jewish periodical at the time.

'''Philip Dirk baron van Pallandt, heer van Eerde''' (28 December 1889 - 1 November 1979) was a [[Scoutmaster]] in the early years of [[Scouting Nederland|Dutch scouting]]. He was the owner of [[Gilwell Ada's Hoeve]] on his Eerde Estate, which he gave to Scouting in 1923.

In 1924, baron Philip van Pallandt deeded the Eerde castle to the [[Order of the Star in the East]], an organization connected to the famous philosopher and spiritual teacher [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], of whom the baron was an avid follower.

&lt;!-- barely scratched, for disambig purposes; have to run now, sorry. --&gt;

In [[theology]], '''ponerology''' (from Greek ''poneros'', "evil") is a study of [[evil]]. Major subdivisions of the study are the nature of evil, the origin of evil, and evil in relation to the Divine Government.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Presbyterian Review|date=1881|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQEFAAAAQAAJ|page=423|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Immanuel Nitzsch]] outlined his ''System der christlichen Lehre'' (''System of Christian Doctrine'') into three major rubrics: [[Agathology]], or the Doctrine of the Good; Ponerology, or Doctrine of the Bad; and [[Soteriology]], or the Doctrine of Salvation. He further subdivided ponerology into the topics of [[Sin]] and of [[Death]]&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Methodist Review|date=1895|volume=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdMWAQAAIAAJ|page=203|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=System of Christian doctrine|author=Nitzsch, C.I.|date=1849|publisher=T. &amp; T.

The tendencies that prevailed in the late 1930s for closer relations between the state and Lutheran church [...] ended with the Soviet occupation in 1940.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Second World War]], Estonia was approximately 80% [[Protestant]]; overwhelmingly [[Lutheran]].

Between 2001 and 2011 census, [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] overtook [[Lutheranism]] to become the largest [[Christian denomination]] in the country due to increasing unaffiliation and very small conversions among Estonians and more migration from [[Russians|Russian]] neighbors. [[Lutheranism]] still remains the most popular religious group among ethnic [[Estonians]] (11% of them are Lutherans while also 2% of them are Orthodox), while [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] is practised mainly by the mostly non-indigenous immigrant [[Slavs|Slavic]] minorities (~45% of them are Orthodox). According to the [[University of Tartu]], irreligious Estonians are not necessarily [[Atheism|atheists]]; instead, the years 2010s have witnessed a growth of [[Neopagan]], [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] beliefs among those who declare themselves to be "not religious".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Noorkõiv (6 November 2012).

==History==
In the 13th century, the [[Teutonic Knights]] brought [[Christianity]] to Estonia as part of the [[Livonian Crusade]] and during the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church]] became the [[established church]].&lt;ref name="FrancoeurNoonan2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Francoeur|first1=Robert T.|last2=Noonan|first2=Raymond J.|title=The Continuum Complete International Encyclopedia of Sexuality|year=2004|publisher=[[A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=9780826414885|page=361|quote=The dominant religion in Estonia is Evangelical Lutheranism. Estonians were Christianized by the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century. During the Reformation, Lutheranism spread, and the church was officially established in Estonia in 1686.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Second World War]], Estonia was approximately 80% [[Protestant]]; overwhelmingly [[Lutheran]], with individuals adhering to [[Calvinism]], as well as other Protestant branches. [[Robert T. Francoeur]] and Raymond J. Noonan write that "In 1925, the church was separated from the state, but [[religious education|religious instruction]] remained in the schools and clergymen were trained at the Faculty of Theology at [[Tartu University]]. With the Soviet occupation and the [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|implementation of anti-Christian legislation]], the church lost over two thirds of its clergy. Work with children, youth, publishing, and so on, was banned, church property was nationalized, and the Faculty of Theology was closed."&lt;ref name="FrancoeurNoonan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Francoeur|first1=Robert T.|last2=Noonan|first2=Raymond J.|title=The Continuum Complete International Encyclopedia of Sexuality|year=2004|publisher=[[A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=9780826414885|page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aldis Purs, a professor of history at the [[University of Toronto]] writes that in Estonia, as well as Latvia, some evangelical Christian clergy attempted to resist the Soviet policy of [[state atheism]] by engaging in anti-regime activities such as [[Bible]] smuggling.&lt;ref name="Purs2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Purs|first=Aldis|title=Baltic Facades: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania since 1945|date=15 February 2013|publisher=[[Reaktion Books]]|isbn=9781861899323|page=79|quote=The Soviet union was an avowed atheist state that placed great restrictions on religious practice. Resistance to state-sponsored atheism came from established (although heavily restricted and monitored) religious clergy and from believers roughly following an evangelical Christianity. In Estonia and Latvia Bible-smuggling from the West was one of the more common methods of anti-regime activity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text titled ''World and Its Peoples: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland'', published by the [[Marshall Cavendish]], states that in addition to the [[USSR anti-religious campaign (1928–41)|Soviet antireligious campaign]] in Estonia, which mandated the confiscation of church property and deportation of theologians to [[Vorkutlag|Siberia]], many "churches were destroyed in the German occupation of Estonia, from 1941 through 1944, and in World War II (1939-1945)".&lt;ref name=MarshallCavendish2010&gt;{{cite book|title=World and Its Peoples: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland|year=2010|publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]]|isbn=9780761478966|page=1066|author1=Triin Edovald |author2=Michelle Felton |author3=John Haywood |author4=Rimvydas Juskaitis |author5=Michael Thomas Kerrigan |author6=Simon Lund-Lack |author7=Nicholas Middleton |author8=Josef Miskovsky |author9=Ihar Piatrowicz |author10=Lisa Pickering |author11=Dace Praulins |author12=John Swift |author13=Vytautas Uselis |author14=Ilivi Zajedova |quote=It is usually said that Estonia is a Protestant country; however, the overwhelming majority of Estonians, some 72 percent, are nonreligious. Estonia is the European Union (EU) country with the greatest percentage of people with no religious belief. This is in part, the result of Soviet actions and repression of religion. When the Soviet Union annexed Estonia in 1940, church property was confiscated, many theologians were deported to Siberia, most of the leadership of Evangelical Lutheran Church went into exile, and religious instruction was banned. Many churches were destroyed in the German occupation of Estonia, from 1941 through 1944, and in World War II (1939-1945), and religion was actively persecuted in Estonia under Soviet rule 1944 until 1989, when some measure of tolerance was introduced.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], this antireligious legislation was annulled.&lt;ref name="Francoeur2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Francoeur|first1=Robert T.|last2=Noonan|first2=Raymond J.|title=The Continuum Complete International Encyclopedia of Sexuality|year=2004|publisher=[[A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=9780826414885|page=361|quote=It was not until 1998 that the state's religious policies became tolerant, and by 1990, repressive legislation was annulled. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than a third of the population define themselves as believers; of those most are Eastern Orthodox, predominantly, but not exclusively, among the [[Slavs|Slavic]] minorities, or Lutheran.

{{Jordan Series}}

[[Sunni Islam]] is the dominant religion in Jordan. Muslims make up about 93% of the country's population.&lt;ref name="pewforum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/|title=Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] | work=The World's Muslims: Unity and Diversity|date=9 August 2012|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a small number of [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]] Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/56.html|title=Propagation of Islam|publisher=Al Islam|first=Ahmad|last=Kurshid|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Shiite]]s. Many Shia are Iraqi and Lebanese refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/live_from_the_arab_spring/article/shiites_in_jordan_maintained_low_profile_while_marking_ashura_observance|title=Shiites in Jordan maintained low profile while marking Ashura observance|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=27 November 2012|publisher=The Jewish Journal|first=Adam|last=Nicky|work=The Media Line}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country also boasts one of the [[Christianity in Jordan|oldest Christian communities]] in the world, coexisting with the rest of the population. They made up about 4.2% of the population when the country had 5 million inhabitants in 2005 (Who are the Christians in the Middle East, Betty Jane &amp; J. Martin Bailey, pp.&amp;nbsp;168–169). down from 20% in the 1930s, due to several reasons, mainly due to high rates of Muslim immigration into the country. More than half are [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Jordan|Greek Orthodox]]. The rest are Latin or Greek Rite Catholics, Syrian Orthodox, Protestants and Armenians., ibid. Jordanian Christians in  a country of almost 10 million are thought to number 250,000-400,000 excluding tens of thousands Syrian and Iraqi Christians in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=الأب د. حنا كلداني: نسبة الأردنيين المسيحيين المقيمين 3.68%|first=Hanna|last=Kildani|publisher=Abouna.org|accessdate=17 July 2016|date=8 July 2015|url=http://www.abouna.org/holylands/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%A8-%D8%AF-%D8%AD%D9%86%D8%A7-%D9%83%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AD%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%86-368-%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%81%D9%88%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%83|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study estimates some 6,500 Christian believers from a Muslim background in the country, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnstone|first1=Patrick|last2=Miller|first2=Duane|title=Believers in Christ from a Muslim Background: A Global Census|journal=IJRR|date=2015|volume=11|page=14|url=https://www.academia.edu/16338087/Believers_in_Christ_from_a_Muslim_Background_A_Global_Census|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are around 20,000 to 32,000 [[Druze in Jordan|Druze]] living mostly in the north of Jordan, while there are fewer than 800 Jordanian Bahá'ís mainly living in Addassia village near the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jordan  International Religious Freedom Report 2005|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2005/51602.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no legal restrictions on Jews, but in 2006 there were reported to be no Jewish citizens.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of State (2006), International Religious Freedom Report 2006. [https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2006/71424.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahaijo.org/ البهائيون في الأردن]&lt;/ref&gt; and religious minorities practice freely in Jordan, however, with specific restrictions.

==Distribution==
The percentages vary slightly in different cities and regions, for instance the south of Jordan and cities like [[Zarqa]] have the highest percentage of Muslims, while [[Amman]], [[Irbid]], [[Madaba]], [[Al-Salt|Salt]], and [[Al Karak|Karak]] have larger Christian communities than the national average, and the towns of [[Fuheis]], [[Al Husn]] and [[Ajloun]] have either majority Christian or much greater than national average. Several villages have mixed Christian/Muslim populations, like Kufranja and Raimoun in the north.

Anglicans/Episcopalians in Jordan are under the oversight of the [[Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem]]. The [[Church of the Redeemer, Amman|Church of the Redeemer]] is the largest congregation by membership of any church in the entire [[Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East#Diocese of Jerusalem|Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem]]. Other Episcopal churches are in Ashrafiyya, Salt, Zarqa, [[Marka refugee camp]], Irbid, Al Husn and [[Aqaba]].

==Social life==
In general, [[Islam in Jordan|Muslims]] and [[Christianity in Jordan|Christians]] live together with no major problems regarding differences and discrimination. However, the smallest minorities, consisting of small Shia, Bahá'ís, and Druze contingents, experience the greatest degree of religious discrimination from the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/essays/religious-freedom-in-jordan The Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs at Georgetown University: Religious Freedom in Jordan]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include instances of rejection by the Jordanian government to recognize members of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] and the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assabeel.net/local/item/50372-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%81%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9 الطائفة البهائية تتقدم بطلب اعتراف من ''الداخلية'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious freedom==
{{main|Freedom of religion in Jordan}}
The [[state religion]] is [[Islam]], but the [[Constitution of Jordan|constitution]] provides for the freedom to practice one's religion in accordance with the customs that are observed in the Kingdom, unless they violate public order or morality.

Some issues, however, such as [[religious conversion]], are controversial. Although conversion to Islam is relatively free of legal complications, those wishing to leave Islam risk the loss of civil rights and face immense societal pressure. Among the restrictions against religious minorities are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/reljordan00.html Reports on Religious Freedom: Jordan (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Various reports of anti-Semitism (as a provocative reaction to tensions in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]])
* Jordan's government may deny recognition to a religion
* Bahá'ís are not permitted to establish schools, places of worship or cemeteries
* Aside from Christians, all other non-Muslim minorities do not have their own courts to adjudicate personal status and family matters
* Christian missionaries may not evangelize to Muslims

In June 2006, the government published the ''International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights'' in the government's ''Official Gazette''. Article 18 of that Covenant provides freedom of religion.

'''Sandon''' (sometimes spelled Sandes, Sandan or Sanda) was a god in ancient [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]], visually represented as a mitre-wearing human form carrying a sword, a flower or (commonly) an axe who stands on the back of a horned and winged lion.&lt;ref&gt;Donald A.

{{Muslim Beliefs|width=22.0em|Five Pillars}}

'''Schools of Islamic theology''' are various [[Islamic schools and branches]] in different schools of thought regarding [[aqidah]] (creed). According to [[Muhammad Abu Zahra]], [[Qadariyah]], [[Jahmi]]s, [[Murji'ah]], [[Muʿtazila]], [[Batiniyya]], [[Ash'ari]], [[Maturidi]], [[Traditionalist Theology (Islam)|Athari]] are the ancient schools of aqidah.
[[File:Abd_Allah_Musawwir_-_The_Meeting_of_the_Theologians_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb|260px|The Meeting of the Theologians by Abd Allah Musawwir, mid-16th century.]]
The main split between [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] Islam was initially more political than theological, but over time theological differences have developed. Still, differences in aqidah occur as divisions orthogonal to the main divisions in Islam along political or [[fiqh]] lines, such that a Muʿtazili might, for example, belong to [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'fari]], [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] or even [[Hanafi]] school of jurisprudence.

{{main|Aqidah|Islamic schools and branches}}
''[[Aqidah]]'' is an Islamic term meaning "[[creed]]" or "belief". Any religious belief system, or creed, can be considered an example of ''aqidah''. However this term has taken a significant technical usage in Muslim history and [[theology]], denoting those matters over which Muslims hold conviction. The term is usually translated as "theology". Such traditions are divisions orthogonal to sectarian divisions of Islam, and a [[Mu'tazili]] may for example, belong to Jafari, Zaidi or even Hanafi school of jurisprudence.
One of the earliest systematic theological school to develop, in the mid 8th-century, was [[Mu'tazila]]. It emphasized  reason and rational thought, positing that the injunctions of God are accessible to rational thought and inquiry and  that the [[Qur'an]], albeit the word of God, was created rather than uncreated, which would develop into one of the most contentious questions in Islamic theology.

In the 10th century, the [[Ash'ari]] school developed as a response to  Mu'tazila, leading to the latter's decline. Ash'ari still taught the use of reason in understanding the Qur'an, but denied the possibility to deduce moral truths by reasoning. This was opposed by the school of [[Maturidi]], which taught that certain moral truths may be found by the use of reason without the aid of revelation.

Another point of contention was the relative position of [[Iman (concept)|''iman'' ("faith")]] vs. [[Taqwa|''taqwa'' ("piety")]]. Such schools of theology are summarized under ''[[Ilm al-Kalam]]'', or "science of discourse", as opposed to mystical schools who deny that any theological truth may be discovered by means of discourse or reason.

== Sunni schools of theology ==
{{Sunni Islam|Sunni Schools of Divinity}}
{{main|Sunni Islam}}

[[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] are the largest [[Religious denomination|denomination]] of Islam and are known as ''Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamā‘h'' or simply as ''Ahl as-Sunnah''. The word ''Sunni'' comes from the word ''[[sunnah]]'', which means the teachings and actions or examples of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. Therefore, the term "Sunni" refers to those who follow or maintain the ''sunnah'' of the prophet Muhammad.

The Sunnis believe that Muhammad did not appoint a successor to lead the Muslim ''[[ummah]]'' (community) before his death, and after an initial period of confusion, a group of his most prominent [[Sahabah|companions]] gathered and elected [[Abu Bakr|Abu Bakr Siddique]], Muhammad's close friend and a father-in-law, as the first ''[[caliph]]'' of Islam. Sunni Muslims regard the first four caliphs ([[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar|`Umar ibn al-Khattāb]], [[Uthman Ibn Affan]] and [[Ali|Ali ibn Abu Talib]]) as "[[Rashidun|al-Khulafā’ur-Rāshidūn]]" or "The Rightly Guided Caliphs." After the Rashidun, the position turned into a hereditary right and the caliph's role was limited to being a political symbol of Muslim strength and unity. 

=== Athari ===
{{main|Traditionalist Theology (Islam)}}

'''Atharism''' ({{lang-ar|أثري}};  ''textualism'') is a movement of [[Islam]]ic scholars who reject rationalistic Islamic theology ([[kalam]]) in favor of strict textualism in interpreting the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name=Halverson-36q&gt;{{cite book|last=Halverson|first=Jeffry R.|title=Theology and Creed in Sunni Islam: The Muslim Brotherhood, Ash'arism, and Political Sunnism |date=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137473578|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IYzGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Athari+islam#v=onepage&amp;q=Athari%20&amp;f=false|quote=The Atharis can thus be described as a school or movement led by a contingent of scholars (''ulama''), typically [[Hanbalite]] or even [[Shafi'ite]], which retained influence, or at the very least a shared sentiment and conception of piety, well beyond the limited range of Hanbalite communities. This body of scholars continued to reject theology in favor of strict textualism well after Ash'arism had infiltrated the Sunni schools of law. It is for these reasons that we must delineate the existence of a distinctly traditionalist, anti-theological movement, which defies strict identification with any particular ''madhhab'', and therefore cannot be described as Hanbalite.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name is derived from the Arabic word '''{{transl|ar|ALA|athar}}''', literally meaning "remnant" and also referring to a "narrative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Aaron|last=Spevack|title=The Archetypal Sunni Scholar: Law, Theology, and Mysticism in the Synthesis of Al-Bajuri|pages=169|publisher=State University of New York Press|date=2014|isbn=978-1-4384-5370-5|quote=The term Atharis is derived from athar, which implied transmitted content (rather than rationally derived content).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their disciples are called the ''Athariyya'', or Atharis. 

For followers of the Athari movement, the "clear" meaning of the Qur'an, and especially the prophetic traditions, has sole authority in matters of belief, and to engage in rational disputation ([[kalam]]), even if one arrives at the truth, is absolutely forbidden.&lt;ref name="TCSI2010: 36"&gt;[[#TCSI2010|Halverson, ''Theology and Creed in Sunni Islam'', 2010]]: 36&lt;/ref&gt; Atharis engage in an amodal reading of the Qur'an, as opposed to one engaged in ''Ta'wil'' (metaphorical interpretation). They do not attempt to conceptualize the meanings of the Qur'an rationally, and believe that the "real" meaning should be consigned to God alone (''tafwid'').&lt;ref name="TCSI2010: 36-7"&gt;[[#TCSI2010|Halverson, ''Theology and Creed in Sunni Islam'', 2010]]: 36-7&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the meaning has been accepted without asking "how" or "[[Bi-la kaifa]]".

On the other hand, the famous [[Hanbali]] scholar [[Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi|Ibn al-Jawzi]] states, in ''[[Kitab Akhbar as-Sifat]],'' that [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] would have been opposed to [[anthropomorphic]] intrepretations of [[Qur'anic]] texts such as those of al-Qadi Abu Ya'la, Ibn Hamid and Ibn az-Zaghuni.&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Merlin. ''A Medieval Critique of Anthropomorphism''. Brill, 2001, p.134-137 .&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi]]'s criticism of ''[[Athari]]-[[Hanbalis]],'' [[Muhammad Abu Zahra]], a Professor of [[Islamic law]] at [[Cairo University]] deduced that ''Salafi [[aqidah]]'' is located somewhere between [[ta'tili]] and [[anthropopathy]] ''([[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] [[Zahir (Islam)|Ẓāhir]]īsm in understanding the [[tashbih]] in [[Qur'an]])''&lt;ref name="Zahra"&gt;[[Muhammad Abu Zahra]], ''The history of [[Madh'hab]]s and [[Divinity]] Schools in Islam.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=news&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/node/216148 Scholar of renown: Muhammad Abu Zahrah].

''[[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] [[Zahir (Islam)|Ẓāhir]]īsm'' and total rejection of ''[[ta'wil]]'' are amongst the fundamental characteristics of this ''"new"'' Islamic school of theology.

=== Ilm al-Kalām ===
{{main|Ilm al-Kalam}}
'''''ʿIlm al-Kalām''''' ({{lang-ar|{{large|علم الكلام}}}}, literally "science of discourse"&lt;ref name="Wolfson"&gt;Winter, Tim J. "Introduction." Introduction. The Cambridge Companion to Classical Islamic Theology. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2008. 4-5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;), usually foreshortened to '''kalam''' and sometimes called "Islamic scholastic theology", is an rational undertaking born out of the need to establish and defend the tenets of Islamic faith against doubters and detractors.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Pelner Cosman, Linda Gale Jones, Handbook to Life in the Medieval World, p 391. {{ISBN|1438109075}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Ilm al-Kalam incorporates [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian reasoning]] and [[logic]] into Islamic theology. A scholar of kalam is referred to as a ''mutakallim'' (plural ''mutakallimūn'') as distinguished from philosophers, jurists, and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Bennett, The Bloomsbury Companion to Islamic Studies, p 119. {{ISBN|1441127887}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many possible interpretations as to why this discipline was originally called "kalam"; one is that the widest controversy in this discipline has been about whether the [[Logos|Word]] of [[Allah|God]], as revealed in the [[Qur'an]], can be considered part of God's essence and therefore not created, or whether it was made into words in the normal sense of [[speech]], and is therefore created.

==== Ash'ariyyah ====
{{main|Al-Ash`ari}}
The Mu'tazila were challenged by [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|Abu al-Hasan Al-Ash'ari]], who famously defected from the Mu'tazila and formed the rival [[Ash'ari]] school of theology.&lt;ref&gt;[[John L. Esposito]], The Oxford History of Islam, p 280. {{ISBN|0199880417}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ash'ari school took the opposite position of the Mu'tazila and insisted that truth cannot be known through reason alone. The Ash'ari school further claimed that truth can only be known through revelation. The Ash'ari claim that without revelation, the unaided human mind would not be able to know if something is good or evil. 

Today, the Ash'ari school is considered one of the Orthodox schools of theology. The Ash'ari school is the basis of the [[Shafi'i]] school of [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]], which has supplied it with most of its most famous disciples.&lt;ref name="arabnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/211921|title=Scholar of renown: Abul-Hassan Al-Ash’ari|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous of these are Abul-Hassan Al-Bahili, [[Al-Baqillani|Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani]], [[al-Juwayni]], [[Al-Razi]] and [[Al-Ghazali]]. Thus [[Al-Ash`ari]]’s school became, together with the [[Maturidi]], the main schools reflecting the beliefs of the Sunnah.&lt;ref name="arabnews.com" /&gt;

===== Jahmiyyah =====
{{main|Jahmites}}
[[Jahmi]]s were the followers of the Islamic theologian [[Jahm bin Safwan]] who associate himself with [[Al-Harith ibn Surayj]]. He was an exponent of extreme [[determinism]] according to which a man acts only metaphorically in the same way in which the sun acts or does something when it sets.&lt;ref name="pest"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watt|first=W. Montgomery|date=May 1970|editor-last=Pestman|editor-first=P. W.|title=The study of the development of the Islamic sects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k84UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA85|journal=Acta Orientalia Neerlandica: Proceedings of the Congress of the Dutch Oriental Society Held in Leiden on the Occasion of Its 50th Anniversary|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the position adopted by the Ash'ari school, which holds that God's omnipotence is absolute and perfect over all creation.

==== Mâtûrîd’iyyah ====
{{main|Maturidi}}
The [[Maturidi]] school was founded by [[Abu Mansur Al Maturidi]], and is the most popular theological school amongst Muslims, especially in the areas formerly controlled by the [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottomans]] and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. Today, the Maturidi school is the position favored by the [[Ahl ar-Ra'y|ahl al-ra'y]] (people of reason), which includes the [[Hanafi]] and [[Maliki]] schools of fiqh who make up the majority of Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://themuslim500.com/downloads/TheMuslim500-2017-lowres.pdf|title=The Muslim 500: The World's 500 Most Influential Muslims|last=Esposito|first=John|date=2017|website=The Muslim 500|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927233013/http://themuslim500.com/downloads/TheMuslim500-2017-lowres.pdf|archive-date=2017-09-27|dead-url=yes|access-date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maturidi school takes the middle position between the Ash'ari and Mu'tazili schools on the questions of knowing truth and [[free will]]. The Maturidis say that the unaided human mind is able to find out that some of the more major sins such as alcohol or murder are evil without the help of revelation, but still maintain that revelation is the ultimate source of knowledge. Additionally, the Maturidi believe that God created and can control all of His creation, but that he allows humans to make individual decisions and choices for themselves.

=== Murji'ah ===
{{main|Murji'ah}}
[[Murji'ah]] ({{lang-ar|{{big|المرجئة}}}}) is an early Islamic school whose followers are known in English as "Murjites" or "Murji'ites" ({{lang|ar|{{big|المرجئون}}}}). The Murji'ah emerged as a theological school in response to the [[Kharijites]] on the early question about the relationship between sin and apostasy ''(rida).'' The Murji'ah believed that sin did not affect a person's beliefs (''[[Iman (concept)|iman]]'') but rather their piety (''[[taqwa]]''). Therefore, they advocated the idea of "delayed judgement," (''irjaa)''. The Murji'ah maintain that anyone who proclaims the bare minimum of faith must be considered a Muslim, and sin alone cannot cause someone to become a disbeliever ''([[kafir]]).'' The Murjite opinion would eventually dominate that of the [[Kharijites]] and become the mainstream opinion in [[Sunni Islam]]. The later schools of Sunni theology adopted their stance while form more developed theological schools and concepts.

== Qadariyyah ==
{{main|Qadariyah}}
[[Qadariyyah]] is an originally derogatory term designating early Islamic theologians who asserted human beings are ontologically free and have a perfect free will, whose exercise justifies divine punishment and absolving God of responsibility for evil in the world.&lt;ref name="Qadariyyah"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2014|title=Qadariyyah|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195125580.001.0001/acref-9780195125580-e-1901|editor=John L.

"Ķadariyya", vol.4, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Their doctrines were adopted by the [[Mu'tazili]]s and rejected by the [[Ash'ari]]s.&lt;ref name="Qadariyyah" /&gt; The tension between free will and God's omnipotence was later reconciled by the [[Maturidi]] school of theology, which asserted that God grants human beings their agency, but can remove or otherwise alter it at any time.  {{Further|'Amr ibn 'Ubayd|Al-Jubba'i|Abd al-Jabbâr al-Hamadhânî|Ibrahim an-Nazzam|Al-Jahiz}}

=== Mu'tazila ===
{{main|Mu'tazili|Wasil Ibn 'Ata'}}The first group to pursue this undertaking were the [[Muʿtazila|Mu'tazila]], who asserted that all truth could be known through reason alone. Mu'tazili theology originated in the 8th century in [[Basra]] when [[Wasil Ibn 'Ata']] stormed out of a lesson of [[Hasan al-Basri]] following a theological dispute. 

The Mu'tazila asserted that everything in revelation could be found through rational means alone. The Mu'tazila were heavily influenced by the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]] they encountered and began to adopt the ideas of [[Plotinus]], whose [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] theology caused an enormous backlash against them. The political backlash the Mu'tazila faced, as well as the challenged brought forth by new schools of theology caused this group to atrophy and  decline into irrelevancy. They are no longer considered an Orthodox school of theology by Sunni Muslims.

== Muhakkima ==
{{main|Muhakkima}}
The groups that were seceded from [[Ali]]'s army in the end of the [[Battle of Siffin#Arbitration|Arbitration Incident]] constituted the branch of ''Muhakkima'' ({{lang-ar|محكمة}}). They mainly divided into two major sects called as [[Kharijites]] and [[Ibadis]].

=== Khawarij ===
{{main|Khawarij}}
The [[Kharijites]] considered the [[caliphate]] of [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]] to be rightly guided but believed that [[Uthman ibn Affan]] had deviated from the path of justice and truth in the last days of his caliphate, and hence was liable to be killed or displaced.  They also believed that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] committed a grave sin when he agreed on the arbitration with [[Muawiyah|Muʿāwiyah]]. In the [[Battle of Siffin]], Ali acceded to Muawiyah's suggestion to stop the fighting and resort to negotiation. A large portion of Ali's troops (who later became the first Kharijites) refused to concede to that agreement, and they considered that Ali had breached a [[Qur'an]]ic verse which states that ''The decision is only for Allah'' (Qur'an 6:57), which the Kharijites interpreted to mean that the outcome of a conflict can only be decided in battle (by God) and not in negotiations (by human beings).

The Kharijites thus deemed the arbitrators ([[Abu Musa Ashaari|Abu Musa al-Ashʿari]] and [[Amr Ibn Al-As]]), the leaders who appointed these arbitrators ([[Ali]] and [[Muawiyah I|Muʿāwiyah]]) and all those who agreed on the arbitration (all companions of [[Ali]] and [[Muawiyah|Muʿāwiyah]]) as [[Kafir|Kuffār]] (disbelievers), having breached the rules of the Qur'an. They believed that all participants in the [[Battle of Jamal]], including [[Talha]], [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam|Zubair]] (both being companions of [[Muhammad]]) and [[Aisha]] had committed a ''Kabira'' (major sin in Islam).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Abul Ala Maududi]], "Khilafat-o-Malookeyat" in Urdu language, (Caliphate and kingship), p 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kharijites reject the doctrine of [[Ismah|infallibility]] for the leader of the Muslim community, in contrast to Shi'a but in agreement with Sunnis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Baydawi|Baydawi, Abdullah]]. "Tawali' al- Anwar min Matali' al-Anzar", circa 1300. Translated alongside other texts in the 2001 "Nature, Man and God in Medieval Islam" by Edwin Elliott Calverley and James Wilson Pollock. pp. 1001-1009&lt;/ref&gt; Modern-day Islamic scholar [[Abul Ala Maududi]] wrote an analysis of Kharijite beliefs, marking a number of differences between Kharijism and Sunni Islam. The Kharijites believed that the act of sinning is analogous to [[Kufr]] (disbelief) and that every grave sinner was regarded as a [[Kafir|Kāfir]] (disbeliever) unless he repents. With this argument, they denounced all the above-mentioned [[Ṣaḥābah]] and even cursed and used abusive language against them. Ordinary Muslims were also declared disbelievers because first, they were not free of sin; secondly they regarded the above-mentioned [[Ṣaḥābah]] as believers and considered them as religious leaders, even inferring [[Islamic jurisprudence]] from the [[Hadith|Hadeeth]] narrated by them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; They also believed that it is not a must for the [[caliph]] to be from the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]. Any pious Muslim nominated by other Muslims could be an eligible [[caliph]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Additionally, Kharijites believed that obedience to the caliph is binding as long as he is managing the affairs with justice and consultation, but if he deviates, then it becomes obligatory to confront him, demote him and even kill him.

The followers of ''"[[Batiniyyah]]-[[Twelver]]" [[madh'hab]]'' consist of [[Alevis]] and [[Nusayris]], who developed their own [[fiqh]] system and do not pursue the [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]].

[[Alevi]]s are sometimes categorized as part of [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam]], and sometimes as its own religious tradition, as it has markedly different philosophy, customs, and rituals. They have many ''[[Tasawwuf]]ī'' characteristics and express belief in the [[Qur'an]] and [[The Twelve Imams]], but reject [[polygamy]] and accept religious traditions predating Islam, like Turkish [[shamanism]]. They are significant in East-Central Turkey. They are sometimes considered a Sufi sect, and have an untraditional form of religious leadership that is not scholarship oriented like other Sunni and Shia groups. Seven to Eleven Million Alevi people including the other denominations of [[Twelver]] [[Shi'ite]]s live in [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref name="alevi"/&gt;

====== Alevi Islamic school of divinity ======
{{main|Safaviyya|Shaykh Haydar|Qizilbash|Imadaddin Nasimi|Hurufism|Bektashism and folk religion}}
In Turkey, [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]] people belong to the [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]] [[Madhhab]], which tracks back to the sixth [[Shia Imam]] [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] ''(also known as Imam Jafar-i Sadiq),'' are called as the Ja'faris, who belong to [[Twelver]] [[Shia]]. Although the Alevi [[Turkish people|Turks]] are being considered as a part of [[Twelver]] [[Shia]] [[Islam]], their belief is different from the [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]] in conviction.
* ''"The Alevi-Turks"'' has a unique and perplex conviction tracing back to [[Kaysanites Shia]] and [[Khurramites]] which are considered as [[Ghulat]] [[Shia]]. According to Turkish scholar Abdülbaki Gölpinarli, the [[Qizilbash]] (''"Red-Heads"'') of the 16th century - a religious and political movement in Azerbaijan that helped to establish the [[Safavid dynasty]] - were "spiritual descendants of the [[Khurramites]]".&lt;ref&gt;Roger M. Savory (ref. Abdülbaki Gölpinarli), [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]], "Kizil-Bash", Online Edition 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Among the members of the "[[Qizilbash]]-[[Tariqah]]"'' who are considered as a sub-sect of the Alevis, two figures firstly ''[[Abu Muslim Khorasani]]'' who assisted [[Abbasid Caliphate]] to beat [[Umayyad Caliphate]], but later eliminated and murdered by Caliph [[Al-Mansur]], and secondly ''[[Babak Khorramdin]]'' who incited a rebellion against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and consequently was killed by Caliph [[al-Mu'tasim]] are highly respected. This belief provides strong clues about their [[Kaysanites Shia]] and [[Khurramites]] origins. In addition, the "[[Safaviyya]] [[Tariqah]]" leader ''[[Ismail I]]'' is a highly regarded individual in the belief of "Alevi-[[Qizilbash]]-[[Tariqah]]" associating them with the ''[[Imamah (Shia Twelver doctrine)]]'' conviction of the "[[Twelver]] [[Shi'a]] [[Islam]]".
* Their [[ʿAqīdah|aqidah]] ''(theological conviction)'' is based upon a syncretic [[fiqh]] system called as "[[Batiniyya]]-[[Sufism]]"&lt;ref name="BĀṬENĪYA"/&gt; which incorporates some ''[[Qarmatian]] sentiments,'' originally introduced by ''"Abu’l-Khāttāb Muhammad ibn Abu Zaynab al-Asadī"'',&lt;ref name="ABU’L-ḴAṬṬĀB ASADĪ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ḴAṬṬĀBIYA"/&gt; and later developed by ''"Maymun al-Qāddāh"'' and his son ''"ʿAbd Allāh ibn Maymun"'',&lt;ref name="MAYMŪN"/&gt; and "[[Mu'tazila]]" with a strong belief in [[The Twelve Imams]].
* Not all of the members believe that the fasting in [[Ramadan]] is obligatory although some Alevi-Turks performs their fasting duties partially in [[Ramadan]].
* Some beliefs of [[Shamanism]] still are common amongst the [[Qizilbash]] Alevi-[[Turkish people]] in villages.
* On the other hand, the members of [[Bektashi Order]] have a conviction of "[[Batiniyya]] [[Isma'ilism]]"&lt;ref name="BĀṬENĪYA"/&gt; and "[[Hurufism]]" with a strong belief in ''[[The Twelve Imams]]''.
* In conclusion, [[Qizilbash]]-Alevis are not  a part of [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]] [[fiqh]], even though they can be considered as members of different [[Tariqa]] of [[Shia Islam]] all looks like sub-classes of [[Twelver]]. Their conviction includes "[[Batiniyya]]-[[Hurufism]]" and "[[Sevener]]-[[Qarmatians]]-[[Ismailism]]" sentiments.&lt;ref name="BĀṬENĪYA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yaşar Nuri Öztürk|Öztürk, Yaşar Nuri]], ''[[Anal Haq|En-el Hak]] [[Rebellion|İsyan]]ı (The [[Anal Haq]] [[Rebellion]]) – [[Mansur Al-Hallaj|Hallâc-ı Mansûr]] ([[Gallows|Darağacı]]nda [[Mi'raj|Miraç]] - [[Mi'raj|Miraç]] on [[Gallows]]),'' Vol 1 and 2, Yeni Boyut, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They all may be considered as special groups not following the [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]], like [[Alawites]] who are in the class of [[Ghulat]] [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam]], but a special [[Batiniyya]] belief somewhat similar to [[Isma'ilism]] in their conviction. 
{{Alevism|collapsed=1}}
* In conclusion, [[Twelver]] branch of [[Shia Islam]] [[Muslim]] population of [[Turkey]] is composed of [[Mu'tazila]] [[ʿAqīdah|aqidah]] of [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]] [[madhhab]], [[Batiniyya]]-[[Sufism]] [[ʿAqīdah|aqidah]] of Maymūn’al-Qāddāhī [[fiqh]] of the Alevīs, and Cillī [[aqidah]] of Maymūn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu’l-Qāsim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabarānī]] [[fiqh]] of the [[Alawites]],&lt;ref name="Meymûn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both ''Muhammad ibn Āliyy’ūl Cillī'' and ''Maymūn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu’l-Qāsim’at-Tabarānī]]'' were the [[murid]]s of ''"[[Al-Khaṣībī]],"'' the founder of the [[Ibn Nusayr|Nusayri]] [[tariqa]].&lt;/ref&gt; who altogether constitutes nearly one third of the whole population of the country.

{{cquote|bgcolor=#F0FFF0|What's Alevism, what's the understanding of [[Islam]] in Alevism? The answers to these questions, instead of the opposite of what's known by many people is that the birthplace of ''Alevism'' was never in ''[[Anatolia]].'' This is an example of great ignorance, that is, to tell that the ''Alevism'' was emerged in ''Anatolia.'' Searching the source of ''Alevism'' in Anatolia arises from unawareness. Because there was not even one single Muslim or [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] in Anatolia before a specific date. The roots of ''Alevism'' stem from [[Turkestan]] - [[Central Asia]]. Islam was brought to Anatolia by Turks in 10th and 11th centuries by a result of migration for a period of 100 - 150 years. Before this event took place, there were no Muslim and Turks in Anatolia. Anatolia was then entirely [[Christian]].

*Some of the differences that mark [[Alevi]]s from Shi'a Islam are the non-observance of the five daily prayers and prostrations (they only bow twice in the presence of their spiritual leader), Ramadan, and the Hajj ''(they consider the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] an external pretense, the real pilgrimage being internal in one's heart)''; and non-attendance of mosques.&lt;ref name=angelfire&gt;{{cite web|title=The Alevi of Anatolia|url=http://www.angelfire.com/az/rescon/ALEVI.html|website=angelfire.com|accessdate=27 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423153420/http://www.angelfire.com/az/rescon/ALEVI.html|archivedate=23 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some of their members (or sub-groups) claim that [[God in Islam|God]] takes abode in the bodies of the human-beings (''ḥulūl''), believe in [[metempsychosis]] (''tanāsukh''), and consider [[Sharia|Islamic law]] to be not obligatory (''ibāḥa''), similar to [[antinomianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Edinburgh University Press| isbn = 978-0-7486-1888-0| last = Halm| first = Heinz| title = Shi'ism| date = 2004-07-21| page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some of the Alevis criticizes the course of [[Islam]] as it is being practiced overwhelmingly by more than 99% of [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] population.
*They believe that major additions had been implemented during the time of [[Ummayads]], and easily refuse some basic principles on the grounds that they believe it contradicts with the holy book of [[Islam]], namely the [[Qur'an]].
*Regular daily [[salat]] and [[fasting]] in the holy month of [[Ramadan]] are officially not accepted by some members of ''[[Alevism]]''.
*Some of their sub-groups like ''[[ishikism|Ishikists]]'' and ''[[Bektashi]]s,'' who portrayed themselves as ''[[Alevi]]s,'' neither comprehend the essence of the regular daily [[salat]] ''(prayers)'' and [[fasting]] in the holy month of [[Ramadan]] that is frequently accentuated at many times in [[Quran]], nor admits that these principles constitute the ineluctable foundations of the [[Dīn]] of [[Islam]] as they had been laid down by [[God in Islam|Allah]] and they had been practised in an uninterruptible manner during the period of [[Prophet Muhammad]].
*Furthermore, during the period of [[Ottoman Empire]], Alevis were forbidden to proselytise, and Alevism regenerated itself internally by paternal descent. To prevent penetration by hostile outsiders, the Alevis insisted on strict endogamy which eventually made them into a quasi-ethnic group. Alevi taboos limited interaction with the dominant Sunni political-religious centre. Excommunication was the ultimate punishment threatening those who married outsiders, cooperated with outsiders economically, or ate with outsiders. It was also forbidden to use the state (Sunni) courts.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

===== Baktāshism ''(Bektaşilik)'' =====
{{main|Bektashism}}
[[File:Hajji Bektash Wali.jpeg|thumb|262px|The founder of the [[Bektashiyyah]] [[sufi]] order [[Haji Bektash Veli|Hacı Bektaş-ı Veli ''(Ḥājjī Baktāsh Walī)'']], a [[murid]] of [[Malamatiyya|Malāmatī]]-[[Qalandariyya|Qalāndārī]] [[Sheikh]] [[Qutb ad-Dīn Haydar]], who introduced the [[Ahmad Yasavi]]'s [[doctrine]] of ''"[[Four Doors|Four Doors and Forty Stending]]"'' into his [[tariqah]].]]
====== Baktāshi Islamic School of Divinity ======
{{main|Bektashiyyah|Wahdat-ul-Wujood}}
The Bektashiyyah is a Shia Sufi order founded in the 13th century by [[Haji Bektash Veli]], a dervish who escaped Central Asia and found refuge with the Seljuks in Anatolia at the time of the Mongol invasions (1219–23). This order gained a great following in rural areas and it later developed in two branches: the ''Çelebi clan,'' who claimed to be physical descendants of Haji Bektash Veli, were called ''"Bel evladları" (children of the loins),'' and became the hereditary spiritual leaders of the rural Alevis; and the ''Babağan,'' those faithful to the path ''"[[tariqa|Yol]] evladları" (children of the [[tariqa|way]]),'' who dominated the official Bektashi Sufi order with its elected leadership.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

[[Bektashism]] places much emphasis on the concept of [[Sufi metaphysics|Wahdat-ul-Wujood]] وحدة الوجود, the "Unity of Being" that was formulated by [[Ibn Arabi]]. This has often been labeled as [[pantheism]], although it is a concept closer to [[panentheism]]. Bektashism is also heavily permeated with Shiite concepts, such as the marked veneration of [[Ali]], [[The Twelve Imams]], and the ritual commemoration of [[Day of Ashura|Ashurah]] marking the [[Battle of Karbala]]. The old [[Iran|Persian]] holiday of [[Nowruz]] is celebrated by Bektashis as [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imam]] Ali's birthday.

In keeping with the central belief of ''[[Wahdat-ul-Wujood]]'' the Bektashi see reality contained in [[Haqq-Muhammad-Ali]], a single unified entity. Bektashi do not consider this a form of [[trinity]]. There are many other practices and ceremonies that share similarity with other faiths, such as a ritual meal (''muhabbet'') and yearly confession of sins to a ''baba'' (''magfirat-i zunub'' مغفرة الذنوب). Bektashis base their practices and rituals on their non-orthodox and [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|mystical interpretation]] and understanding of the [[Qur'an]] and the prophetic practice ([[Sunnah]]). They have no written doctrine specific to them, thus rules and rituals may differ depending on under whose influence one has been taught. Bektashis generally revere Sufi mystics outside of their own order, such as [[Ibn Arabi]], [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[Rumi|Jelalludin Rumi]] who are close in spirit to them.

====== The Baktāshi ʿaqīdah ======
[[File:Syariah-thariqah-hakikah2.jpg|thumb|260px|'''[[Four Doors|Four Spiritual Stations]] in [[Bektashiyyah]]:''' [[Sharia]], [[tariqa]], [[haqiqa]], and the fourth station, [[marifa]], which is considered "unseen", is actually ''the center'' of the ''[[haqiqa]]'' region. [[Marifa]] is the essence of all four stations.]]
{{main|Mysticism|Four Doors|Hajji Bektash Wali|Sharia|Tariqa|Haqiqa|Marifa}}
The Bektashi Order is a Sufi order and shares much in common with other Islamic mystical movements, such as the need for an experienced spiritual guide — called a ''[[Baba (honorific)|baba]]'' in Bektashi parlance — as well as the doctrine of "the four gates that must be traversed": the "[[Sharia]]" ''([[religious law]]),'' "[[Tariqah]]" ''(the spiritual path),'' "[[Haqiqa]]h" ''(truth),'' and "[[Marifa]]" ''(true knowledge).''

Bektashis hold that the Qur'an has two levels of meaning: an outer (''[[Zahir (Islam)|Zāher]]'' ظاهر) and an inner (''[[Batin (Islam)|bāṭen]]'' باطن).&lt;ref name="Bāṭenī"&gt;{{cite web|last=Radtke|first=B|title=Bāṭen|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baten-inner-hidden-the-opposite-of-zaher-outer-visible|publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica|accessdate=20 August 2014|authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They hold the latter to be superior and eternal and this is reflected in their understanding of both the universe and humanity, which is a view that can also be found in [[Ismailism]] and [[Batiniyya]].&lt;ref name="BĀṬENĪYA"/&gt;

[[Bektashism]] is also [[Initiation|initiatic]] and members must traverse various levels or ranks as they progress along the spiritual path to the [[Reality]]. First level members are called ''aşıks'' عاشق. They are those who, while not having taken initiation into the order, are nevertheless drawn to it. Following initiation (called ''nasip'') one becomes a ''mühip'' محب. After some time as a ''mühip'', one can take further vows and become a ''[[dervish]]''. The next level above dervish is that of ''baba''. The ''baba'' (lit. father) is considered to be the head of a ''[[Khanqah|tekke]]'' and qualified to give spiritual guidance (''irshad'' إرشاد). Above the ''[[Baba (Alevism)|baba]]'' is the rank of ''halife-baba'' (or ''[[Dedes|dede]]'', grandfather). Traditionally there were twelve of these, the most senior being the ''dedebaba'' (great-grandfather). The ''dedebaba'' was considered to be the highest ranking authority in the Bektashi Order. Traditionally the residence of the ''dedebaba'' was the Pir Evi (The Saint's Home) which was located in the shrine of [[Hajji Bektash Wali]] in the central Anatolian town of [[Hacıbektaş|Hacıbektaş ''(Solucakarahüyük)'']].

The [[Imamah (Shi'a twelver doctrine)|twelfth Imam]] is believed to be in [[The Occultation|occultation]], and will appear again just before the ''Qiyamah'' (Islamic view of the Last Judgment). The Shia ''hadiths'' include the sayings of the Imams. Many Muslims criticise the Shia for certain beliefs and practices, including practices such as the [[Mourning of Muharram]] (''Mätam''). They are the largest Shia school of thought (93%), predominant in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]], Iraq, [[Lebanon]] and [[Bahrain]] and have a significant population in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan [[Kuwait]] and the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern province of Saudi Arabia]].

===== Shaykhism =====
[[Shaykhism]] is an Islamic religious movement founded by [[Shaykh Ahmad]] in the early 19th century [[Qajar dynasty]], Iran, now retaining a minority following in Iran and Iraq.

======The ‘Alawite ʿaqīdah======
Alawites have always described themselves as being Twelver Shi'ite Muslims and have been recognized as such by the prominent Lebanese Shi'ite cleric [[Musa al-Sadr]].&lt;ref name="Kramer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martinkramer.org/sandbox/reader/archives/syria-alawis-and-shiism/|title=Syria's '‘Alawis and Shi‘ism|last=Kramer|first=Martin|quote=In their mountainous corner of Syria, the 'Alawī claim to represent the furthest extension of Twelver Shi'ism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunni [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]] [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] issued a ''fatwa'' recognising them as part of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]] in the interest of [[Arab nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Talhamy | first1 = Y. | title = The Fatwas and the Nusayri/Alawis of Syria | doi = 10.1080/00263200902940251 | journal = Middle Eastern Studies | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 175–194 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bar-AsherKootstra2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Me'ir Mikha'el Bar-Asher|author2=Gauke de Kootstra|author3=Arieh Kofsky|title=The Nuṣayr−i-ʻalaw−i Religion: An Enquiry Into Its Theology and Liturgy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bli4DyuHRIC&amp;pg=RA1-PA153|accessdate=18 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-12552-0|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Athari]] Sunni (modern day [[Salafi]]s) scholars such as [[Ibn Kathir]] ''(a disciple of [[Ibn Taymiyya]])'' have categorised Alawites as [[Paganism|pagans]] in their writings.&lt;ref name="GlobSec"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17085226|title=Syria crisis: Deadly shooting at Damascus funeral|work=BBC News|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abdullah"&gt;Abd-Allah, Umar F., ''Islamic Struggle in Syria'', Berkeley : Mizan Press, c1983, pp. 43–48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barry Rubin]] has suggested that Syrian leader [[Hafiz al-Assad]] and his son and successor [[Bashar al-Assad]] pressed their fellow Alawites "to behave like ''regular Muslims,'' shedding (or at least concealing) their distinctive aspects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Barry|title=The Truth about Syria|location=New York|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2007 |page=49|isbn=9781403982735 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1970s a booklet, ''al-`Alawiyyun Shi'atu Ahl al-Bait'' ("The [[Alawites]] are Followers of [[Ahl al-Bayt|the Household of the Prophet]]") was published, which was "signed by numerous 'Alawi' men of religion", described the doctrines of the [[Imami]] Shia as Alawite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abd-Allah|first=Umar F.|title=Islamic Struggle in Syria|location=Berkeley|publisher=Mizan Press|year=1983 |pages=43–48|isbn=0933782101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, there has been a recent movement to unite Alawism and the other branches of Twelver Islam through educational exchange programs in Syria and [[Qom]].&lt;ref name="CoFR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/iran/syria-iran-mideast-conflict/p11122 |title=Syria, Iran, and the Mideast Conflict |last=Esther |first=Pan |date=18 July 2006|work=Backgrounder|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|accessdate=30 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523091927/http://www.cfr.org/iran/syria-iran-mideast-conflict/p11122 |archivedate= 23 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources have discussed the "Sunnification" of [[Alawites]] under the al-Assad regime.&lt;ref name=dilemma/&gt; [[Joshua Landis]], director of the Center for Middle East Studies, writes that [[Hafiz al-Assad]] "tried to turn Alawites into 'good' (read Sunnified) Muslims in exchange for preserving a modicum of secularism and tolerance in society".

===== Kızılbaşlık =====
{{main|Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|Qizilbash}}

====== The Qizilbash ʿaqīdah ======
[[File:Arolsen Klebeband 01 457 1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Shah Ismail I]], the [[Sheikh]] of the [[Safaviyya|Safavi]] [[tariqa]], founder of the [[Safavid Dynasty]] of [[Iran]], and the [[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[Kızılbaş]] [[armies]] had contributed a lot for the development and implementation of ''The [[Qizilbash]] [[ʿAqīdah]]'' amongst the [[Turkmen people]].]]
[[Qizilbash]] and [[Bektashi]] [[tariqah]] shared common religious beliefs and practices becoming intermingled as [[Alevi]]s in spite of many local variations. Isolated from both the [[Sunni]] [[Ottomans]] and the [[Twelver]] [[shia islam|Shi`a]] [[Safavids]], [[Qizilbash]] and [[Bektashi]] developed traditions, practices, and doctrines by the early 17th century which marked them as a closed autonomous religious community. As a result of the immense pressures to conform to Sunni Islam, all members of [[Alevism]] developed a tradition of opposition ''([[Antinomianism|ibāḥa]])'' to all forms of external religion.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

The doctrine of [[Qizilbash]]ism is well explained in the following poem written by the [[Shaykh]] of [[Safaviyya]] [[tariqah]] [[Ismail I|Shāh Ismāʿil Khatai]]:

{{Quotation|من داها نسنه بيلمه زه م  / Men daha nesne bilmezem, ''(I don't know any other object)''

آللاه بير محممد على́دير / [[Allah]] bir [[Muhammad-Ali]]'dir. ''([[God in Islam|Allah]] is unique [[Muhammad-Ali]])''

اؤزوم غوربتده سالمازام / Özüm gurbette salmazam, ''(I can't let out my own essence to places far from my homeland)''

آللاه بير محممد على́دير / [[Allah]] bir [[Muhammad-Ali]]'dir.  ''([[God in Islam|Allah]] is unique [[Muhammad-Ali]])''

اونلار بيردير، بير اولوبدور / Onlar birdir, bir oluştur, ''(They are unique, a single one, i.e. [[Haqq-Muhammad-Ali]])''

يئردن گؤيه نور اولوبدور / [[Earth|Yer]]den [[Sky|göğ]]e [[Nūr (Islam)|nûr]] oluştur, ''(It's a [[Nūr (Islam)|nūr]] from [[Earth]] to [[Sky]])''

دؤرد گوشه ده سيرر اولوبدور، / Dört guşede sır oluştur, ''(It's a mysterious [[occult]] [[secret]] in every corner of the square)''

آللاه بير محممد على́دير / [[Allah]] bir [[Muhammad-Ali]]'dir. ''([[God in Islam|Allah]] is unique [[Muhammad-Ali]])''

ختايى بو يولدا سردير / [[Khatai]] bu [[tariqah|yol]]da [[secret|sır]]dır, ''([[Khatai]] in this [[tariqah]] is a mysterious [[occult]] [[secret]])''

سرين وئره نلر ده اردير / [[Secret|Sır]]ın verenler de [[soldier|er]]dir, ''(Those reveal their own [[secret]] are [[Private (rank)|private]] as well)''

آيدا سيردير، گونده نوردور / [[Moon|Ay]]da [[secret|sır]]dır, [[day|gün]]de [[Nūr (Islam)|nûr]]dur, ''([[Secret]] on [[Moon]], [[Nūr (Islam)|nūr]] on [[day]])''

آللاه بير محممد على́دير / [[God in Islam|Allah]] bir [[Muhammad-Ali]]'dir. ''([[God in Islam|Allah]] is unique [[Muhammad-Ali]])''}}

The lines of poetry above may easily be judged as an act of  "[[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]]" ''([[polytheism]])'' by the [[Sunni]] [[Ulama]], but they have a [[Batin (Islam)|bāṭenī]]&lt;ref name="Bāṭenī"/&gt; taʾwīl ''(inner explanation)'' in [[Qizilbash]]ism.

===== Anthropopathy in the history of Ghulāt Shia =====
{{main|Anthropopathism|Anthropotheism|Incarnation (Christianity)}}
The belief of [[Incarnation]] was first emerged in [[Abdullah ibn Saba'|Sabaʾiyya]], and later some personalities like [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah]], [[Abu Muslim]], [[Sunpadh]], [[Ishaq al-Turk]], [[Al-Muqanna]], [[Babak Khorramdin]], [[Maziar]] and [[Ismail I]] had become the subject of [[God incarnate]]s.

== Ahmad’iyyah ==
{{Ahmadiyya|collapsed=1}}
The [[Ahmadis]]' beliefs are more aligned with the Sunni tradition,  such as [[The Five Pillars of Islam]] and [[Iman (concept)#The Six articles of Islamic faith|The Six articles of Islamic Faith]]. Likewise, Ahmadis accept the [[Qur'an]] as their holy text, face the [[Kaaba]] during prayer, accept the authority of [[Hadith]]s (reported sayings of and stories about Muhammad) and practice the [[Sunnah]] (traditions) of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel ''et al.'': ''Der Islam III. Volksfrömmigkeit, Islamische Kultur, Zeitgenössische Strömungen.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 1990, S. 418–420&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadi teachings state that the founders of all the major world religions had divine origins. God was working towards the establishment of Islam as the final religion, because it was the most complete and included all the previous teachings of other religion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/The_Promised_Messiah_Prophecies_Fulfilled-20081007MN.html |title=The Promised Messiah - Prophecies Fulfilled |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725000642/http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/The_Promised_Messiah_Prophecies_Fulfilled-20081007MN.html| archivedate= 25 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (but they believe that all other religions have gone astray in their present form). The completion and consummation of the development of religion came about with the coming of Muhammad; and that the perfection of the ‘manifestation’ of Muhammad’s prophethood and of the conveyance of his message was destined to occur with the coming of the [[Mahdi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=2739&amp;region=E1&amp;CR=EN,E2 |title=The Holy Quran |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725000651/http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=2739&amp;region=E1&amp;CR=EN,E2| archivedate= 25 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community regard [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], who claimed to be the promised [[Messiah]] ("[[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus|Christ]]") the [[Mahdi]] awaited by the Muslims and a [[Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)|'subordinate' prophet]] to Muhammad whose job was to restore the Sharia given to Muhammad by guiding or rallying disenchanted [[Ummah]] back to Islam and thwart attacks on [[Islam]] by its opponents, as the "Promised One" of all religions fulfilling eschatological prophecies found in the scriptures of the [[Abrahamic religions]], as well as [[Zoroastrianism]], the [[Indian religions]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American traditions]] and others.&lt;ref name="ita_4"&gt;Invitation to Ahmadiyyat by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad Part II, Argument 4, Chapter "Promised Messiah, Promised One of All Religions"&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmadi Muslims believe that Ahmad was divinely commissioned as a true reflection of Muhammad's prophethood to establish the unity of God and to remind mankind of their duties towards God and God's creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q78O1mjX2tMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=simon+ross+valentine+ahmadiyya&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TxzyTZTSOMSp8APp55CIBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4QuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya jamaʻat: history, belief, practice | pages=32–33 | author=Simon Ross Valentine | publisher=Columbia University Press| isbn=978-0-231-70094-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/2007WCJSSpeech_20071228.pdf | title=Raising Ahmadi Children in the West | author=Nasir Mahmood Malik, National Tarbiyyat Secretary, USA | publisher=Al Islam | accessdate=10 June 2011 | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol''' (Tib. ཞབས་དཀར་ཚོགས་དྲུག་རང་གྲོལ་, [[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]. ''zhabs dkar tshogs drug rang grol'') (1781-1851) was a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] yogi and poet from [[Amdo]]. Shabkar's yogic and poetic skill is considered second only to [[Milarepa]].&lt;ref&gt;Pang, Rachel Hua-Wei; Dissipating Boundaries : The "Life", Song- Poems, and Non-Sectarian Paradigm of Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol (1781--1851)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ricard; ''The Life of Shabkar: The Autobiography of a Tibetan Yogin'', SUNY, 1994, page vii&lt;/ref&gt;

Shabkar begin his spiritual practice early, completing a one year retreat at the age of 16, later becoming a Gelug monk at 20.&lt;ref&gt;Ricard; ''The Life of Shabkar: The Autobiography of a Tibetan Yogin'', SUNY, 1994, page xiii&lt;/ref&gt; Shabkar studied with masters of all major Tibetan Buddhist schools including [[Gelug]] and [[Nyingma]], and received [[Dzogchen]] teachings from his main root guru [[Chögyal Ngakgi Wangpo]].&lt;ref&gt;Ricard; ''The Life of Shabkar: The Autobiography of a Tibetan Yogin'', SUNY, 1994, page xiv&lt;/ref&gt; He spent years in solitary retreats in various caves, woods and mountains of Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Ricard; ''The Life of Shabkar: The Autobiography of a Tibetan Yogin'', SUNY, 1994, page xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Shabkar's works express non-sectarian ideals similar to those of the 19th century [[Rimé movement]], even though he predates the movement by about three decades and never met with any of the Rime masters from Kham.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel H. Pang; The Rimé Activities of Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol (1781-1851) http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ret/pdf/ret_30_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Shabkar also held that even non-Buddhist religions are manifestations of the Buddhas: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;“''Thus, one should know all the tenets of the religions of Buddhism and non-Buddhism—for example, other religions, Bönpos, the Chan Buddhists, the Nyingma, the Kagyus, the Sakya, the Geluks, and so forth—to be the emanations of the buddhas and bodhisattvas.''”&lt;ref&gt;Rachel H. Pang; The Rimé Activities of Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol (1781-1851) http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ret/pdf/ret_30_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shabkar was a prolific writer, his collecter works running into several volumes. One of his key works is a series of poems on [[Trekchö]] and [[Tögal]], ''Khading Shoklap''—''Flight of the Garuda'' which has become an important text in the [[Nyingma]] Nyingthig tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Duff, Tony, Flight of the Garuda, page viii&lt;/ref&gt; 

He also wrote a spiritual autobiography in mixed prose and verse, which is considered one of the lengthiest and most masterful of the Tibetan [[Namtar (biography)|namtar]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Pang, Rachel Hua-Wei; Dissipating Boundaries : The "Life", Song- Poems, and Non-Sectarian Paradigm of Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol (1781--1851)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shabkar also wrote works promoting [[vegetarianism]] and compassion for animals.&lt;ref&gt;Shabkar, ''Food of Bodhisattvas: Buddhist Teachings on Abstaining from Meat'', Shambhala, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:برج لاجیم.jpg|thumb|The Lajim Tower in [[Savadkuh County|Savadkuh]], where Shahriyar ibn Abbas is buried.]]
'''Kiya Abu'l-Fawaris Shahriyar ibn Abbas ibn Shahriyar''' ({{lang-fa|کیا ابوالفارس شهریار بن عباس بن شهریار}}), better simply known as '''Shahriyar ibn Abbas''' ({{lang|fa|شهریار بن عباس}}) was a [[Bavand dynasty|Bavandid]] prince, who is solely known for being mentioned in the inscription on the mausoleum in [[Savadkuh County|Savadkuh]], known as the Lajim Tower. The mausoleum was constructed in 1022, where he was most already likely dead.{{sfn|Babaie|Grigor|2015|p=153}} The person who ordered the construction was his mother Chihrazad, whilst the name of the architect was a certain al-Husayn ibn Ali. In the inscription, Shahriyar is labeled as "Client of the Commander of the Faithful" (''[[mawla|mawlā]] [[amir al-mu'minin|amīr al-muʾminīn]]''). However, he is not called ''[[ispahbad]]'', which was the title used by the Bavandid rulers, and thus it is dubious if he ever ruled.{{sfn|Madelung|1984|pp=747–753}}{{cref|a}}

Shahriyar was possibly a grandson of the Bavandid ruler [[Shahriyar III]] (r. 986-988), and may have been the Shahriyar that the prominent Persian poet and author of ''[[Shahnameh]]'' ("Book of Kings"), [[Ferdowsi]] visited in 1010/1.{{sfn|Madelung|1984|pp=747–753}}

== Notes ==
{{cnote|a|The Bavandid ruler [[Abu Ja'far Muhammad]], who was a contemporary of Shahriyar, had constructed his mausoleum a year earlier, where he is also labeled as "Client of the Commander of the Faithful", but also as ''ispahbad''.{{sfn|Babaie|Grigor|2015|p=150}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10804">The term '''Stoic categories''' refers to [[Stoicism|Stoic]] ideas regarding [[category of being|categories of being]]: the most fundamental classes of being for all things. The Stoics believed there were four categories (substance, quality, disposition, relative disposition) which were the ultimate divisions. Since we do not now possess even a single complete work by [[Zeno of Citium]], [[Cleanthes]] or [[Chrysippus]] what we do know must be pieced together from a number of sources: [[Doxography|doxographies]] and the works of other [[philosophers]] who discuss the Stoics for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See the entry [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism] in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The present information comes from [[Plotinus]] and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], with additional evidence from [[Plutarch|Plutarch of Chaeronea]] and [[Sextus Empiricus]]. According to both Plotinus and Simplicius there were four Stoic categories, to wit:

* [[Substance theory|substance]] (ὑποκείμενον [''hypokeímenon'' "underlying"])
** The primary matter, formless substance (''ousia'') which makes up things.
* [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] (ποιόν [''poión'' "like what"])
** The way in which matter is organized to form an individual object. In Stoic physics, a physical ingredient (''pneuma'': air or breath) which informs the matter.
* "somehow disposed" (πὼς ἔχον [''pós échon''])
** Particular characteristics, not present within the object, such as size, shape, action, and posture.
* "somehow disposed in relation to something" (πρός τί πως ἔχον [''prós tí pos échon''])
** Characteristics which are related to other phenomena, such as the position of an object within time and space relative to other objects.

A simple example of the Stoic categories in use is provided by Jacques Brunschwig:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am a certain lump of matter, and thereby a substance, an existent something (and thus far that is all); I am a man, and this individual man that I am, and thereby qualified by a common quality and a peculiar one; I am sitting or standing, disposed in a certain way; I am the father of my children, the fellow citizen of my fellow citizens, disposed in a certain way in relation to something else.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Brunschwig (2003), ''The Cambridge Companion to the Stoics'', ed. Brad Inwood, page 228, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
[[Stoicism]], like [[Aristotelianism]] is derived from [[Platonism|Platonic]] and [[Socrates|Socratic]] traditions.  The Stoics held that all [[being]] (ὄντα) — though not all things (τινά) — are [[Matter|corporeal]]. They accepted the distinction between [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] bodies and [[Abstract object|abstract]] ones, but rejected [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] teaching that purely [[incorporeal]] being exists. Thus, they accepted [[Anaxagoras|Anaxagoras']] idea (as did Aristotle) that if an object is hot, it is because some part of a universal heat body had entered the object. But, unlike Aristotle, they extended the idea to cover all [[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]]. Thus if an object is red, it would be because some part of a universal red body had entered the object.

In addition, the Stoics differed from Aristotle in their sharp distinction between concrete and abstract terms. Technically speaking all four Stoic categories are of concrete bodies. For Aristotle ''white, whiteness, heat'', and ''hot'' were qualities. For the Stoics, however, quality refers to ''white'', but not ''whiteness; hot'', but not ''heat.'' Furthermore, they believed that there are concrete bodies with no corresponding abstraction, something that makes no sense in Aristotelian terms.

It was apparent that the mere distinction between concrete substance and concrete quality was not a sufficient basis for [[logic]]. [[Socrates]] in the [[Hippias Major]] had pointed out problems in Anaxagoras' approach, explaining all attributes through their presence in a body in the way one body may be contained in another. In that [[dialog]], Hippias tried to explain [[beauty]] to Socrates. Socrates finds fault with his explanations, that beauty is a beautiful maiden, that beauty is gold, that beauty is health, wealth and a long life.

Aristotle solved the problem in proposing that accidental attributes are non-substantial beings that [[Inherence|inhere]] in substances. He defines this presence saying ''"By being 'present in a subject' I do not mean present as parts are present in a whole, but being incapable of existence apart from the said subject."'' (''[[Categories (Aristotle)|The Categories]]'' 1&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; 24–26)

Such incorporeal presence caused problems to the Stoics in saying that the [[Ousia|οὐσία]] of a thing is its [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]]. It is easy to understand the problem. If there is an insubstantial being, ''in Athens'' somehow present in Socrates, causing him to be substantially present in Athens we seem to be faced with an infinite regression, for there would seem to be an insubstantial Socrates in the insubstantial Athens in Socrates, in Athens, etc. Ultimately, who is to say who is the real Socrates and what is the real Athens? Similar arguments can be made of Aristotle's other categories. Was there an insubstantial ''running'' in [[Archimedes]] causing him to run naked through the streets of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], shouting out his immortal "''[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]''"? Was there an insubstantial fist in Athena causing her to strike Aphrodite as the [[Iliad]] recounts?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Once Hera spoke, Athena dashed off in pursuit,&lt;br /&gt;
delighted in her heart. Charging Aphrodite, &lt;br /&gt;
she struck her in the chest with her powerful fist.[http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/homer/iliad21.htm] 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It was the effort to solve the problems raised by the [[Platonists]] and [[Peripatetics]] that led the Stoics to develop their categories, ''somehow disposed'' and ''somehow disposed in relation to something.'' The fact that Stoicism, rather than either Platonism or Aristotelianism became the prominent philosophy of the ancient world is due in part to the approach they took to the problem.

According to [[Stephen Menn]] the first two categories, substance and quality, were recognized by [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]]. The fourth category ''somehow disposed in relation to something'' seems to have been developed by the time of [[Aristo of Chios|Aristo]]. The third category, ''somehow disposed'' is first seen in [[Chrysippus]].

The need for relative terms, seen in the fourth category ''somehow disposed in relation to something'' is more obvious than the need for the third category ''somehow disposed'' and so it seems to have arisen first.

Aristotle had used relative terms in a somewhat general way. ''"Those things are called relative, which, being either said to be of something else or related to something else, are explained by reference to that other thing."'' (''The Categories'' 6&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; 37–38) Thus he says that ''knowledge'' and ''the thing known'' are relatives. One can certainly consider knowledge as something properly existing in its subject. Aristotle himself recognized a much different kind of relationship. ''"In respect of relation there is no proper change; for, without changing, a thing will be now greater and now less or equal, if that with which it is compared has changed in quantity."'' ([http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.14.xiv.html#95 ''Metaphysics'' 1088&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; 33–35]) In the first case, a relative term can be said to be something ''in'' its subject. In the second case, it can not. Thus, the need for ''somehow disposed in relation to something'' to explain how one thing can be relative to another without the presence of anything corporeal in a subject.

According to Stephen Menn, the third category, ''somehow disposed'' probably was recognized first in relation to the virtues. According to Socrates, virtue was a sort of knowledge. The wise man will act virtuously, since he will see it as the right thing to do. But the ignorant man can not avoid vice. The Stoic position held that a sage will possess all the virtues in their fullness. Aristo had argued that there is really only one virtue differentiated as ''somehow disposed in relation to something.'' This seemed to be too much like the [[Megarian school of philosophy|Megarian]] position. Chrysippus thus came to see the virtues as distinct bodies, inseparable from each other ''somehow disposed'' in themselves and not in relation to something. Thus the need for the third category.

==Neoplatonic critique==
Plotinus criticized both Aristotle's Categories and those of the Stoics. His student [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] however defended Aristotle's scheme. He justified this by arguing that they be interpreted strictly as expressions, rather than as metaphysical realities. The approach can be justified, at least in part, by Aristotle's own words in ''The Categories.'' [[Boethius]]' acceptance of Porphyry's interpretation led to their being accepted by [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophy.

The Stoic scheme did not fare as well. Plotinus wrote...
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Besides, if they make life and soul no more than this "pneuma,"
what is the import of that repeated qualification of theirs "in a
certain state," their refuge when they are compelled to recognize some
acting principle apart from body? If not every pneuma is a soul, but
thousands of them soulless, and only the pneuma in this "certain
state" is soul, what follows? Either this "certain state," this
shaping or configuration of things, is a real being or it is nothing.

If it is nothing, only the pneuma exists, the "certain state"
being no more than a word; this leads imperatively to the assertion
that Matter alone exists, Soul and God mere words, the lowest alone
is.

If on the contrary this "configuration" is really existent-
something distinct from the underlie or Matter, something residing
in Matter but itself immaterial as not constructed out of Matter, then
it must be a Reason-Principle, incorporeal, a separate Nature.[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/plotinus]

'''SunniPath''' now known as '''Qibla''' was established in 2003 for the purpose of answering questions about Islamic law, belief, and daily practice.  In 2004, it began offering online courses in Islamic law, belief, Arabic, and other related disciplines. Sunnipath has now changed its name and calls itself 'Qibla' [Arabic word meaning 'direction']; it no longer has a questions and answer facility for the general public and is now strictly an online Islamic courses site, although the previously answered questions and articles are still available.

==Program Summary==
The Academy is an online Islamic institute and has taught nearly 4000 students since its inception. It has about 700-1000 students each semester, offers an average of 30 courses each semester, and has over a dozen teachers on its teaching staff.

The Academy's programs includes certifications and degrees in Islamic Studies and Arabic. In 2008, it partnered with [http://www.wise.edu.jo WISE University] to offer a fully online accredited [[Associate Degree]] in [[Islamic Studies]].

In addition to online courses, it also has an on-the ground institute in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] called [http://www.daraltawfiq.com Dar al-Tawfiq], and holds a yearly deen intensive in Amman called Shifa.

==Views==
Sunnipath, as an organization, promotes the perspective of [[Sunni Islam]] and approaches [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]] from one of the four mainstream Sunni [[Madhhab|schools]] of Islamic law. Sunnipath also stands opposed to the distortion of Islam, particularly the largely Saudi-funded perceptions of Wahhabism (a puritan movement initiated by Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab of Najd, Saudi Arabia).

==Teachers==
Teachers include notable scholars [[Habib Umar bin Hafiz]], [[Habib Ali al-Jifri]], [[Nuh Ha Mim Keller]], Sheikh Hamza Karamali, and the late Grand Mufti of Jordan, Sheikh Nuh Ali Salman, Shaykh [[Faraz Rabbani]].

The '''Temple of Edfu''' is an [[Egyptian temple]] located on the west bank of the [[Nile]] in [[Edfu]], [[Upper Egypt]]. The city was known in the [[Hellenistic period]] as {{lang-grc-koi|Ἀπόλλωνος πόλις}} and [[Latin]] ''Apollonopolis Magna'', after the chief god [[Horus]], who was identified as [[Apollo]] under the [[interpretatio graeca]].&lt;ref&gt;David, Rosalie. Discovering Ancient Egypt, Facts on File, 1993. p.99&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the best preserved shrines in Egypt. The temple was built in the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] between 237 and 57 BC. The inscriptions on its walls provide important information on language, myth and religion during the [[Hellenistic period]] in Egypt. In particular, the Temple's inscribed building texts "provide details [both] of its construction, and also preserve information about the mythical interpretation of this and all other temples as the Island of Creation."&lt;ref&gt;David, op. cit., p.99&lt;/ref&gt; There are also "important scenes and inscriptions of the Sacred Drama which related the age-old conflict between Horus and [[Set (deity)|Seth]]."&lt;ref&gt;David, op. cit., p.99&lt;/ref&gt; They are translated by the German [[Edfu-Project]].

==History==
[[File:S10.08 Edfu, image 9886.jpg|thumbnail|left|North side of court of Temple of Edfu]]
[[File:S10.08 Edfu, image 9885.jpg|thumbnail|left| Door of the Pylon]]
Edfu was one of several temples built during the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], including the [[Dendera Temple complex]], [[Esna]], the [[Temple of Kom Ombo]], and [[Philae]]. Its size reflects the relative prosperity of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Agnese, Giorgio and Maurizio Re. Ancient Egypt: Art and archaeology of the land of the pharaohs, 2004. p.23 {{ISBN|0-7607-8380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present temple, which was begun "on 23 August 237 BC, initially consisted of a pillared hall, two transverse halls, and a barque sanctuary surrounded by chapels."&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Nigel Strudwick &amp; Sabine Gardiner, The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egyptian Architecture, I.B. Tauris Publishers, 2003. p.78&lt;/ref&gt; The building was started during the reign of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] and completed in 57 BC under [[Ptolemy XII Auletes]]. It was built on the site of an earlier, smaller temple also dedicated to Horus, although the previous structure was oriented east-west rather than north-south as in the present site. A ruined [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]] lies just to the east of the current temple; inscriptional evidence has been found indicating a building program under the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] rulers [[Ramesses I]], [[Seti I]] and [[Ramesses II]].

A [[naos (hieroglyph)|naos]] of [[Nectanebo II]], a relic from an earlier building, is preserved in the inner sanctuary, which stands alone while the temple's barque sanctuary is surrounded by nine chapels.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Strudwick &amp; Gardiner, op. cit., p.78&lt;/ref&gt; 

The temple of Edfu fell into disuse as a religious monument following [[Theodosius I]]'s [[persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire|persecution of pagans]] and edict banning non-Christian worship within the [[Roman Empire]] in 391. As elsewhere, many of the temple's carved reliefs were razed by followers of the Christian faith which came to dominate Egypt. The blackened ceiling of the [[hypostyle]] hall, visible today, is believed to be the result of arson intended to destroy religious imagery that was then considered pagan.

Over the centuries, the temple became buried to a depth of 12 metres (39&amp;nbsp;ft) beneath drifting desert sand and layers of river silt deposited by the Nile. Local inhabitants built homes directly over the former temple grounds. Only the upper reaches of the temple pylons were visible by 1798, when the temple was identified by a French expedition. In 1860 [[Auguste Mariette]], a French [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]], began the work of freeing Edfu temple from the sands.

The Temple of Edfu is nearly intact and a very good example of an ancient Egyptian temple.&lt;ref&gt;David., op. cit., p.99&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple of Edfu's archaeological significance and high state of preservation has made it a centre for [[tourism in Egypt]] and a frequent stop for the many [[riverboat]]s that cruise the Nile. In 2005, access to the temple was revamped with the addition of a visitor center and paved carpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guardians.net/spotlite/spotlite-hawass-2005.htm|title=SPOTLIGHT INTERVIEW 2005 - Dr. Zahi Hawass|accessdate=2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A sophisticated lighting system was added in late 2006 to allow night visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/EgyptOnline/tourism/000003/0204000000000000002517.htm|title=Night visits to Temple of Horus allowed as of New Year|accessdate=2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance==
The temple of Edfu is the largest temple dedicated to [[Horus]] and [[Hathor]] of [[Dendera]].&lt;ref&gt;David, op. cit., p.99&lt;/ref&gt; It was the center of several festivals sacred to Horus. Each year, "Hathor travelled south from her temple at [[Dendera Temple complex|Denderah]] to visit Horus at Edfu, and this event marking their sacred marriage was the occasion of a great festival and pilgrimage."&lt;ref&gt;David., op. cit., p.99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on British architecture==
The Temple of Edfu provides the model for [[Temple Works]] in [[Holbeck]], [[Leeds]]. The courtyard columns at Edfu are closely copied in the frontage of the Works.

'''''The Jewel of Medina''''' is a [[historical novel]]&lt;!--please do not add "fictional" — "novel" implies that it's fiction.--&gt; by Sherry Jones.

In 2007, Random House bought the publication rights to ''The Jewel of Medina'' in a $100,000, two-book contract.&lt;ref name=wsj-nomani&gt;{{cite news |first=Asra Q. |last=Nomani |authorlink=Asra Nomani |title=You Still Can't Write About Mohammad |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121797979078815073 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=2008-08-06 |accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was scheduled to be published on August 12, 2008.&lt;ref name="joneswp"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sherry |last=Jones |title=Censoring "The Jewel Of Medina" |url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/postglobal/islamsadvance/2008/08/censoring_islam.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher="Islam's Advance: PostGlobal" blog |date=30 December 2009|accessdate=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of the Month Club]] had agreed to feature the novel in its August 2008 issue, and [[Quality Paperback Book Club]] was due to follow suit in January 2009.&lt;ref name="joneswp" /&gt; The novel's original marketing blurb read, "Married at six to the much-older Muhammad, Aisha uses her wits, her courage, and her sword to defend her first-wife status even as Muhammad marries again and again, taking 12 wives and [[concubines]] in all."&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Suzanne |last=Goldenberg |title=Novel on prophet's wife pulled for fear of backlash |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/09/fiction.terrorism |work=The Guardian  |date=9 August 2008|accessdate=2008-09-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denise Spellberg===

According to an opinion article by [[Asra Nomani]] in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', the original publication plans began to unravel when Random House received an email from [[University of Texas]] Professor of history and Middle Eastern Studies [[Denise Spellberg]], which was critical of the book and suggested its publication may inspire violent reactions from some Muslims. Random House's publicity department had sent Spellberg galleys of the novel, hoping for publishable comments from her. Instead, she found the book a "very ugly, stupid piece of work", and suggested that it may elicit violence akin to past controversies over ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' and the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons]]. Similarly, Jane Garrett, an editor at Random House's Knopf imprint, said in an email that Spellberg had told her by phone that she thought the novel should be withdrawn due to "a very real possibility of major danger for the building and staff and widespread violence." Garrett also claimed Spellberg described the book as "a declaration of war...explosive stuff...a national security issue."&lt;ref name="wsj-nomani"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, Random House cancelled publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Book on Prophet Muhammad's wife dropped |url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080060474&amp;ch=8/7/2008%2012:26:00%20PM |work=[[Press Trust of India]] |publisher=[[NDTV]] |date=7 August 2008|accessdate=2008-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nomani also wrote that Shahed Amanullah, a guest lecturer in Spellberg's classes and the editor of altmuslim.com, a popular Muslim Web site, sent emails to a listserv of Middle East and Islamic studies graduate students about the book. Amanullah later stated he had received a "frantic call" from Spellberg who "was upset", telling him that the novel "made fun of Muslims and their history," and asked him to "warn Muslims" about the book since "she found it incredibly offensive".&lt;ref name="wsj-nomani"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Amstate1/&gt;

In the wake of Nomani's article, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published an editorial criticizing Random House's decision to "dump" the book "[w]ithout waiting for an actual uproar in the Muslim world";&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/21/AR2008082103104.html Random Error, Editorial, Washington Post, August 22, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08244/907791-44.stm Censorship never goes out of style] by Bob Hoover, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', August 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lvrj.com/opinion/27343729.html Islamic intimidation trumps liberty again], Editorial, ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'', August 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; were also critical of Random House's decision to cancel the book's publication. [[Irshad Manji]] wrote in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' that pre-emptive censorship was offensive to Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080822.wcomanji23/BNStory/specialComment/home Pre-emptive Censorship is Offensive to Muslims] by Irshad Manji, ''The Globe and Mail'', August 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; while poet and literary critic [[Adam Kirsch]] criticized Spellberg and Random House for depriving the Muslim reading public of the freedom to reimagine their religious tradition through the eyes of a novelist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/opinion/freedoms-gift-to-religion/84637/ Freedom's Gift to Religion] by Adam Kirsch, ''New York Sun'', August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Pennsylvania]] adjunct lecturer [[Carlin Romano]], writing in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', criticized Spellberg for her "aggressive act" in working to cancel publication, for effectually advocating censorship, and what she claimed were Spellberg's "disingenuous" attempts to deny that she had played an instrumental role in the Random House decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/weekly/v55/i04/04b00501.htm 'The Jewel of Medina': Anatomy of a Ruckus] by Carlin Romano, ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', September 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spellberg subsequently wrote a letter to the ''Wall Street Journal'' contesting Nomani's characterization of her as the "instigator" of the book's cancellation. Spellberg stated that "I felt it was my professional responsibility to counter this novel's [[Pseudohistory|fallacious representation]] of a very real woman's life." However, she insisted that "I do not espouse censorship of any kind, but I do value my right to critique those who abuse the past without regard for its richness or resonance in the present." She also stated that "The author and the press brought me into a process, and I used my scholarly expertise to assess the novel. It was in that same professional capacity that I felt it my duty to warn the press of the novel's potential to provoke anger among some Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Denise |last=Spellberg |title=I Didn't Kill 'The Jewel of Medina' |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121824366910026293 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] |date=2008-08-09 |accessdate=2008-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding her "frantic" phone call to Shahed Amanullah, Spellberg said she had only intended to call the book to his attention, and that he had apparently misunderstood her intentions.&lt;ref name=Amstate1/&gt; Spellberg also stated that since the story broke she has received hate mail and been roundly pilloried online, stating that "they are calling me an opponent of free speech, saying I am a supporter of Muslim extremists".&lt;ref name=Amstate1/&gt;

===Public statement from Random House===

Random House released a public statement about the decision not to publish the book:

{{quote|After sending out advance editions of the novel ''The Jewel of Medina'', we received in response, from credible and unrelated sources, cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the Muslim community, but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small, radical segment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We felt an obligation to take these concerns very seriously. We consulted with security experts as well as with scholars of Islam, whom we asked to review the book and offer their assessments of potential reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas, even those that may be construed as offensive by some. However, a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears, and in this instance we decided, after much deliberation, to postpone publication for the safety of the author, employees of Random House, booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel. The author and Ballantine subsequently agreed to terminate the agreement, with the understanding that the author would be free to publish elsewhere, if she so chose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/rhpg/medinaletter.html |title=The Jewel of Medina Statement |accessdate=2008-08-18 |publisher=[[Random House|The Random House Publishing Group]] |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Responses===

Jones told [[Reuters]]: "I have deliberately and consciously written respectfully about Islam and Mohammed… I envisioned that my book would be a bridge-builder."&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news |first=Edith |last=Honan |title=Random House pulls novel on Islam, fears violence |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN0736008820080807 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=7 August 2008|accessdate=2008-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote in a blog for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that she was "chagrined to realize the far-reaching ramifications of this historic decision to quash a work of art before it could even reach the public eye."&lt;ref name="joneswp" /&gt;

[[Salman Rushdie]], author of ''The Satanic Verses'', criticized Random House for the decision, saying, "This is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Bone |title=Salman Rushdie attacks 'censorship by fear' over The Jewel of Medina |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article4543243.ece |work=[[The Times]]  |location=London |date=16 August 2008|accessdate=2008-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Franklin, who worked for [[Penguin Books]] when they published ''The Satanic Verses'' and is now the publisher of [[Profile Books]], described the decision as "absolutely shocking" and called the Random House editors "such cowards".&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |first=Alison |last=Flood |title=Call for compensation after shelving of Islam novel |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/12/islam |work=[[The Guardian]]  |date=12 August 2008|accessdate=2008-08-18 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Robertson]], who received terrorist threats for representing Rushdie, said that Random House should pay Jones "substantial compensation" and recommended that the book be placed on a website "so everyone can read it".&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

Writing in his blog for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Stanley Fish]] disagreed with the characterization of the controversy as "censorship", arguing that "Random House is free to publish or decline to publish whatever it likes, and its decision to do either has nothing whatsoever to do with the Western tradition of free speech or any other high-sounding abstraction. …[The cancellation] doesn't rise to the level of constitutional or philosophical concern. And it is certainly not an episode in some 'showdown between Islam and the Western tradition of free speech.' Formulations like that at once inflate a minor business decision and trivialize something too important and complex to be reduced to a high-school civics lesson about the glories of the First Amendment."&lt;ref name="Fish"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/crying-censorship/index.html |title=Crying Censorship |accessdate=2008-08-27 |last=Fish |first=Stanley |authorlink=Stanley Fish |date=24 August 2008|work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=Think Again blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish argued that the term "censorship" should be restricted to cases in which a governmental body interferes with the expression of ideas. However, linguist Bill Poser, writing on the [[Language Log]] blog, disagreed with Fish's interpretation, arguing that "[t]he Enlightenment value of freedom of expression does not lead only to restrictions on the powers of government: it requires that all of us tolerate expression that we may find offensive. A free society cannot permit anyone, government, corporation, church, or individual, to decide what may and what may not be published. That a publisher should cancel publication of a novel out of fear of violence by religious fanatics has everything to do with the Western tradition of free speech. It is a disturbing reminder that this tradition is not universal and that it is at present subject to very real threats."&lt;ref name="poser"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=525 |title=Rushdie 1, Fish 0 |accessdate=2008-08-27 |last=Poser |first=Bill |date=25 August 2008|publisher=[[Language Log]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent planned publication==
On September 4, 2008, it was announced that British publisher Gibson Square would publish ''The Jewel of Medina'' in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="bbcgibson" /&gt; Gibson Square publisher Martin Rynja called for "open access to literary works, regardless of fear" and said, "If a novel of quality and skill that casts light on a beautiful subject we know too little of in the West, but have a genuine interest in, cannot be published here, it would truly mean that the clock has been turned back to the dark ages."&lt;ref name="bbcgibson" /&gt; In a press release, Rynja added, "I was bowled over by the novel and the moving love story and interesting but unknown history it portrays. I was struck by the research of Sherry Jones, who is a journalist with almost 30 years of experience, her literary imagination and passion for the novel's characters."&lt;ref name="gibsonpr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gibsonsquare.com/ |title=Once Feared Historical Novel Finds Home in Britain |accessdate=2008-09-08 |publisher=Gibson House website |date=8 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the decision by Gibson Square, [[Alvaro Vargas Llosa]], a Latin American author, wrote in a widely published article for ''[[The New Republic]]'': "The book's content —&amp;thinsp;which has been described, promisingly, as being full of sex and violence&amp;thinsp;— is irrelevant to the discussion. It may well be, as one scholar who read it contends, that ''The Jewel of Medina'' is pure trash." He closes his essay with: "I am not interested in the reasons why Gibson Square has decided to publish the book —&amp;thinsp;whether opportunism, greed, love of scandal, a dislike of the prophet, or a belief in the merits of the novel. But the fact that someone, somewhere, is willing to run the risk of not letting the threat of violence inhibit free expression is tremendously comforting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tnr.com/story_print.html?id=6c96c81a-63d0-4bcd-8d06-fcfb9b84fccd |title=The Freedom To Publish |accessdate=2008-09-21 |author=Alvaro Vargas Llosa |authorlink=Alvaro Vargas Llosa |date=10 September 2008 |work=[[The New Republic]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006123034/http://www.tnr.com/story_print.html?id=6c96c81a-63d0-4bcd-8d06-fcfb9b84fccd |archivedate=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 27, 2008, Martin Rynja's house in London was firebombed, apparently by individuals opposed to the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/28/muhammad.book.attack|title=Firebomb attack on book publisher|accessdate=2008-09-28|author=Jamie Doward and Mark Townsend|date=28 September 2008|work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three men were arrested on suspicion of commissioning, preparing or instigating acts of terrorism; radical Islamic clerics such as [[Anjem Choudhary]] warned of further attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3097350/Radical-Islamic-clerics-warn-of-further-attacks-after-publisher-is-firebombed.html|title=Radical Islamic clerics warn of further attacks after publisher is firebombed|accessdate=2008-09-28|author=John Bingham|date=28 September 2008|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The three men were caught because officers had been watching them in an intelligence-led surveillance operation; they were later found guilty of conspiracy to recklessly damage property and endanger life.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Fresco, "[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article6295795.ece Radical Muslims guilty of firebomb plot on publisher of Prophet Mohammed book]", ''[[The Times]]'', 15 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the arson attempt, the publisher issued a statement saying that Jones had decided to indefinitely postpone publication of the book.  Jones denies doing so, and says that the decision was entirely the publisher's.&lt;ref name="RCP081231"&gt;Sherry Jones, [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/12/will_2009_be_another_bad_year.html Real Clear Politics (31 December 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, 2008, it was announced that American publisher Beaufort Books (previously best known as the publishers of ''[[If I Did It]]'' by [[O. J. Simpson]]) would publish ''The Jewel of Medina'' in America.&lt;ref name="APBeaufort" /&gt; According to Jones' agent, Natasha Kern, "about a dozen" other publishers had expressed interest in the novel, but some had backed off due to "possible threats".&lt;ref name="APBeaufort" /&gt; Kern said that Beaufort was giving Jones a smaller advance than Random House had, but a higher rate of royalties.&lt;ref name="APBeaufort" /&gt; Beaufort's president, Eric Kampmann, said in a press release, "We are building a great team to bring ''The Jewel of Medina'' to the audience it deserves to have.

==Reviews and critical responses==
Jones provided the manuscript of ''The Jewel of Medina'' to Islamic website [[IslamOnline|IslamOnline.net]], where the novel was reviewed on August 18, 2008, by writer and poet [[Marwa Elnaggar]]. Elnaggar criticizes the book for its inaccurate portrayal of pre-Islamic Arab culture (including non-Arabic customs such as [[bowing]] and [[purdah]]), and suggests that Jones was influenced by "the idea of the exotic and mystical Orient." Elnaggar describes ''The Jewel of Medina'' as "an attempt by a Western writer with little knowledge of Arabic, Arabia, Islam, and Muslims using her own Western, 21st century values, ideals and emotions to portray an unrecognizable version of the well-known and well-documented story of `A'ishah." However, Elnaggar argues that despite the novel's "inaccuracies, its faults, and its biases", its publication should not be stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1218650312355&amp;pagename=Zone-English-ArtCulture%2FACELayout |title=When Sherry Jones Writes About `A'ishah |accessdate=2008-08-18 |last=Elnaggar |first=Marwa |date= |publisher=[[IslamOnline]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 2, 2008, Elnaggar published Jones' response to her review to "present as many sides of an issue as possible" and "for the sake of objectivity" approached the writer and invited her to an interview where she can express her own point of view and clarify many questions that were raised. Unfortunately, Jones said that her publishers have asked her not to speak before the book is published. Instead, Jones sent Elnaggar a column where she speaks about ''The Jewel of Medina'' and the motives behind writing it. However, Jones has promised Elnaggar an interview after the novel is published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1220346186581&amp;pagename=Zone-English-ArtCulture%2FACELayout |accessdate=October 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010172044/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1220346186581&amp;pagename=Zone-English-ArtCulture%2FACELayout |archivedate=October 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 11, 2008, Elnagger wrote "A Second Look at Jewel of Medina".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1221720687208&amp;pagename=Zone-English-ArtCulture%2FACELayout |accessdate=October 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218001145/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1221720687208&amp;pagename=Zone-English-ArtCulture%2FACELayout |archivedate=February 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Muslim writer [[Farzana Versey]] criticized Jones' prose and perspective, based on the published excerpts: "It would be unfair to tar the whole book based on the Prologue, but it gives a credible peek into the language and lack of nuance the author employs. ... Apparently, Ms. Jones for all her two years of research has managed a version of chick lit, where Aisha gets in confessional mode and in a [[Mills and Boon]] fashion 'leans on her husband', 'falls into his arms', and in a rather treacly account relates that 'the pain of consummation soon melted away. Muhammad was so gentle. I hardly felt the scorpion's sting. To be in his arms, skin to skin, was the bliss I had longed for all my life.' At age nine or eleven, the 'all my life' seems rather a stretch."&lt;ref name="versey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stateofnature.org/whoSaysYouCantWrite.html |title=Who Says You Can't Write about Muhammad?

That too constitutes freedom of speech. Fictional accounts of this nature only serve as trashy one-upmanship. They do not humanize or, alas, even demonize religion."&lt;ref name="versey" /&gt;

Egyptian writer [[Ethar El-Katatney]] reviewed the novel on October 6, 2008, in an article for ''[[Egypt Today]]'' entitled "Flawed Jewel" and interviewed both Sherry Jones and Denise Spellberg. She critiqued the book and offered both Jones and Spellberg the opportunity to answer her critiques.".&lt;ref name="El-Katatney"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egypttoday.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=8171 |title=Flawed Jewel |accessdate=2008-10-07 |last=El-Katatney|first=Ethar|authorlink=Ethar El-Katatney |date=October 2008 |work=Egypt Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; El-Katatney also made a telephone interview with Jones publicly accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Jones |first=Sherry |subjectlink=Sherry Jones |interviewer=[[Ethar El-Katatney]] |title=Sherry Jones (by Ethar El-Katatney) |type=Telephone interview |url=http://boomp3.com/listen/c1mtb74b8_g/sherry-jones-by-ethar-el-katatney |format=MP3 |accessdate=2008-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transcript of the interview is available online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090521100841/http://muslimahmediawatch.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/sherry-jones-transcript.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; On October 7, 2008, El-Katatney wrote an [[op-ed]] entitled 'The "Flawed" Jewel of Medina'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://muslimahmediawatch.org/2008/10/07/the-flawed-jewel-of-medina/ |title=The "Flawed" Jewel of Medina |publisher=Muslimahmediawatch.org |date=2008-10-07 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which Jones responded to directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://muslimahmediawatch.org/2008/10/07/the-flawed-jewel-of-medina/#comment-4066 |title=The "Flawed" Jewel of Medina |publisher=Muslimahmediawatch.org |date=2008-10-07 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2008, a Muslim organisation run by British [[Islamist]] [[Anjem Choudary]] and [[Omar Bakri Muhammad]] wrote an article on the novel, referring to it as a "blasphemous book" and to Jones as "an enemy of Islam and author of this heinous book" and her "illicit portrayal of the marriage" of Muhammad and 'Aisha. The organisation states that "''The Jewel of Medina'' is a book that accurately reflects the current temperament of the disbelievers" and that it "is yet another chapter in the continuing war against Islam and Muslims that reveals the burning hatred harboured in the hearts of the disbelievers."&lt;ref name=i4uk&gt;{{cite web

Please do not judge my book by the slander being spread about it! I urge you to read ''The Jewel of Medina'' and see for yourselves that I am respectful toward Islam and your Prophet. Just as I have publicly refused to judge all Muslims by the actions of a violent few, I ask you to judge me and my book by the actual contents of ''The Jewel of Medina.'' Already I have been criticized by non-Muslims as "pandering" to Muslims with my book because it portrays the Prophet Muhammad as a gentle, compassionate, wise leader and man respectful toward women and his wives. Several reviews have been posted already, including a review in ''Egypt Today'', in which the author, a Muslim, says that I have written very favorably about the Prophet. You may not like my book or agree with it, but it does not insult Islam or Muhammad!"&lt;ref name=i4uk /&gt;

''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' gave the novel a rather scathing review.&lt;ref name="NYTBR"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Adams| first = Lorraine| title = Thinly Veiled| newspaper = New York Times Book Review| page = 10| date = December 14, 2008| url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lean more towards the novel being [[historical fiction]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/books/review/Adams-t.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Lorraine | last=Adams | title=Thinly Veiled | date=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer Lorraine Adams notes that "an inexperienced, untalented author has naively stepped into an intense and deeply sensitive intellectual argument" and that "Jones' prose is lamentable".&lt;ref name="NYTBR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==Sequel==
According to the author, several sequels to the book are in the works. A German publisher will publish a sequel to the novel entitled ''A'isha: The Legacy of the Prophet'' and Beaufort Books published the U.S. sequel, titled ''The Sword of Medina'' October 15, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sword-Medina-Novel-Sherry-Jones/dp/0825305209 |title=The Sword of Medina: A Novel: Sherry Jones: 9780825305207: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Xiaodao Lun''' is an anti-[[Daoism|Daoist]] polemic written in 570 for the [[Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou]] (543–578) by the Buddhist courtier [[Zhen Luan]]. After holding several inconclusive debates in the court, Emperor Wu commissioned the ''Xiaodao Lun'' as one of two reports examining the suitability of sponsoring either Buddhism or Daoism as a [[state religion]] for the [[Northern Zhou]] dynasty, with a view towards unifying China. The ''Xiaodao Lun'' mocked Daoist practices, accused Daoists of plagiarizing Buddhist texts, and portrayed the religion as dangerous to social stability. Its advice was disregarded by the Emperor, who supported the preservation of Daoism, but his dynasty was ultimately short-lived. Zhen Luan's ''Xiaodao Lun'' is preserved in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] and is consulted for its quotations of Daoist texts that have not been preserved until today.

==Background==
The Buddhist ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' in China held Buddhism to be superior to Daoism, whose canon it regarded as "heretical" (''xié'' {{lang|zh|邪}}) and "false sutra" (''wěijīng'' {{lang|zh|伪经}}).&lt;ref name="Mollier"&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhism and Taoism Face to Face: Scripture, Ritual, and Iconographic Exchange in Medieval China|first=Christine|last=Mollier|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2008|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daoism|Daoists]], for their part, published the ''[[Huahujing]]'' in the 4th century, which argued that [[Chinese Buddhism]] was a simplified form of Daoism, developed during the travels of the Daoist philosopher [[Laozi]] while he was in India.&lt;ref name="Hussein"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Laughing at the Tao: Debates among Buddhists and Taoists in Medieval China by Livia Kohn (review)|first=Farzeen|last=Farzeen Baldrian-Hussein|pages=361–363|volume=55|number=2|date=October 1996|journal=Asian Folklore Studies|doi=10.2307/1178836}}&lt;/ref&gt; One organized Daoist-Buddhist debate was organized in 520 by the [[Northern Wei]] dynasty (386–535), and a second was organized in 570 by the [[Northern Zhou]] dynasty (557-581), prompted by the proposal by the Buddhist [[Wei Yuansong]] ({{lang|zh|卫元嵩}}) to make the Emperor a divine Buddhist ruler and to weaken the Buddhist ''sangha'''s independence from the state.&lt;ref name="Komjathy"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions|editor1-first=Randall L|editor1-last=Nadeau|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|chapter=The Daoist Tradition in China|first=Louis|last=Komjathy|pages=179–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate was inconclusive, so the [[Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou]] (543–578) commissioned comparative reports on the suitability of Buddhism and Daoism as [[state religion]]s, resulting in the ''Xiaodao Lun'' by official Zhen Luan, and ''[[Erjiao Lun]]'' ({{lang|zh|二教论}}) by [[Dao An]].&lt;ref name="Komjathy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohn"&gt;{{cite book|title=Daoism Handbook|first=Livia|last=Kohn|publisher=Brill|year=2000|editor1-first=Livia|editor1-last=Kohn|chapter=The Northern Celestial Masters|pages=288–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Submitted in 570 as the ''Xiaodao Lun'', Zhen's report denied that Daoism had any value and ridiculed the religion's exorcisms, talismans, and internal inconsistencies.&lt;ref name="Hussein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohn"/&gt;

==Author==
The author of the ''Xiaodao Lun'' was [[Zhen Luan]], an [[apostate]] from Daoism who lived during the [[Northern Zhou]] dynasty (557-581).&lt;ref name="Biblio"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bibliography on East Asian and Philosophy|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|year=2001|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhen Luan was a [[scholar-official]] for Emperor Wu's court who also served as a [[commandant]], [[mathematician]], and [[astronomer]].&lt;ref name="Hussein"/&gt; Zhen trained in a Daoist congregation,&lt;ref name="Wile"/&gt; but converted to Buddhism out of disgust with [[Daoist sexual practices]].&lt;ref name="Hussein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gulik"/&gt; He wrote the ''Xiaodao Lun'' after attending three of the Buddhist-Daoist debates sponsored by Emperor Wu.&lt;ref name="Bokenkamp"/&gt;

==Contents==
The ''Xiaodan Lun'' is written in 36 sections in an imitation of the [[Daozang|Daoist canon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Chinese Mysticism: Philosophy and Soteriology in the Taoist Tradition|first=Livia|last=Köhn|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1992|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aimed to show that the mythology, rituals, and practices of Daoism were inconsistent and absurd.&lt;ref name="Biblio"/&gt; Zhen's text criticizes not those scripture which were most important to contemporary Daoist practice, but those which were easiest to ridicule, such as "The Size of the Sun and the Moon".&lt;ref name="Kirkland"/&gt;  In addition, the treatise references Daoist texts from the [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] and [[Way of the Celestial Masters|Tianshi]] schools of Daoism disproportionately to those from the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] school.&lt;ref name="Kirkland"/&gt;

The polemic accuses Daoists of "stealing" (''qiè'' {{lang|zh|窃}}) the Buddhist [[Lotus Sutra]] for use in Daoist scripture.&lt;ref name="Mollier"/&gt; Zhen further charged the Daoists of not fully understanding the Buddhist texts that they plagiarized.&lt;ref name="Bokenkamp"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Buddhist Apocrypha|editor1-first=Robert E|editor1-last=Buswell|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1990|first=Stephen R|last=Bokenkamp|chapter=Stages of Transcendence}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms prompted some internal Daoist reform, as the Buddhist encyclopedia ''[[Fayuan Zhulin]]'' (668) noted the replacement of Buddhist terminology in Daoist texts with more native Chinese terms.&lt;ref name="Bokenkamp"/&gt;

The ''Xiaodao Lun'' was the most lurid and complete account of [[Daoist sexual practices]] that anti-Daoist polemicists used to attack the religion,&lt;ref name="Wile"&gt;{{cite book|title=Art of the Bedchamber: The Chinese Sexual Yoga Classics Including Women's Solo Meditation Texts|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1992|chapter=Sexual Practices and Taoism|pages=25–26|first=Douglas|last=Wile}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[group sex]] and [[partner swapping]].&lt;ref name="Gulik"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexual Life in Ancient China|first=Robert H Van|last=Gulik|publisher=Brill Archive|year=1974|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another argument of the ''Xiaodao Lun'' implicated Daoism in general for various [[List of peasant revolts|peasant revolts]], including the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] (184–205), whose organizers were associated with secret Daoist societies.&lt;ref name="Lagerwey"&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Chinese Religion: The Period of Division (220-589 AD)|volume=1|first=John|last=Lagerwey|first2=Pengzhi|last2=Lü|publisher=Brill|year=2010|pages=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath of publication==
The Emperor largely disregarded the conclusions of the ''Xiaodao Lun'', positively interpreting Zhen's examples of alleged Daoist plagiarism of Buddhist texts, as increasing Daoism's appeal as a unifying ideology for the Zhou realm.&lt;ref name="Hussein"/&gt; Emperor Wu went on to found the [[Tongdao Guan]] ({{lang|zh|通道观}}) for Daoist research, which would eventually compile the first Daoist encyclopedia, the [[Wushang Biyao]] ({{lang|zh|无上秘要}}).&lt;ref name="Komjathy"/&gt; However, Emperor Wu would not achieve his goal of [[Chinese reunification]], which was achieved by the [[Sui Dynasty]] (581-618), who favored Buddhism over Daoism.&lt;ref name="Kohn"/&gt;

As an [[apologetic]], the ''Xiaodao Lun'' is included in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]].&lt;ref name="Kirkland"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Laughing at the Tao: Debates among Buddhists and Taoists in Medieval China by Livia Kohn (review)|first=Russell|last=Kirkland|pages=152–153|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|date=February 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=55|issue=1|doi=10.2307/2943659}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polemical confrontation between Buddhists and Daoists was limited after the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907), with the last great flareup during the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1279–1368).&lt;ref name="Kirkland"/&gt; The Yuan debates of 1255 and 1258 concluded in a government-sponsored [[book burning]] of Daoist texts and printing materials in 1281.&lt;ref name="Komjathy"/&gt; In modern times, the ''Xiaodao Lun'' is consulted for its quotations of medieval Daoist scriptures that have not survived court censorship.&lt;ref name="Hussein"/&gt;

Satyam (N.T. Rama Rao) is a youth leader and Panchayati Board President. He interferes with the ex-President of the board, Rudrayya (Rao Gopala Rao) from executing his corrupt practices. Satyam and Rudrayya's daughter, Savithri (Jayapradha) are in love and plan to get married. So Rudrayya gets Satyam killed with the help of a professional killer (Prabhakar Reddy). Satyam immediately goes to heaven. He angers the King of Heaven, Indra (Kanta Rao) while Indra is enjoying the dance by Rambha, Urvasi and Menaka. An angered Indra sends Satyam straight to hell headed by Yama (Satyanarayana) and ably assisted by Chitragupta (Allu Ramalingaiah). In hell, Satyam influences the soldiers of death, Yama's army using communist theories and rights of labor, and turns them against their leader-Yama, and Hell shuts down. Yama sends him back to Earth. Yama and Chitragupta visit Earth on a holiday trip and experience the funny aspects of humans. Satyam changes his name and teaches Rudrayya a lesson.

'''Zhang Ling''' ({{zh|s=张陵|t=張陵|p=Zhāng Líng|w=Chang Ling}}; 34–156), [[courtesy name]] '''Fuhan''' ({{zh|s=辅汉|t=輔漢}}), was an Eastern [[Han Dynasty]] [[Taoism|Taoist]] figure credited with founding the [[Way of the Celestial Masters]] sect of Taoism, which is also known as the [[Way of the Five Pecks of Rice]].&lt;ref&gt;https://libcom.org/library/ancient-utopia-peasant-revolts-china-ngo-van-xuyet&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also known as '''Zhang Daoling''' ({{zh|s=张道陵|t=張道陵|p=Zhāng Dàolíng|w=Chang Tao-ling}}), '''Celestial Master Zhang''' (張天師, ''Zhāng tiānshī''), '''Ancestral Celestial Master''' (祖天師, ''Zǔtiānshī'') or '''Zhengyi Zhenren''' (正一真人) to Taoists. Zhang is sometimes pictured riding on a tiger. In some Taoist sects, Zhang, along with [[Ge Xuan]], Xu Xun ([[:zh:许逊|许逊]]) and Sa Shoujian ([[:zh:萨守坚|萨守坚]]), are called the "Four Celestial Masters" (四大天師).

==Biography==
{{Taoism}}
[[File:Zhang Daoling.jpg|thumb|Zhang Daoling as pictured in ''Myths and Legends of China'' by [[E. T. C. Werner]]]]
The details of the life of the historical figure Zhang Ling are obscure; most of the information about him comes from later scripture and hagiography. According to these, Zhang traced his ancestral home to [[Feng County, Jiangsu]], and was said to be a descendant of [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]]. He was born in the tenth year of the ''Jianwu'' era during the reign of [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]]. He started reading the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' at a young age and studied in the [[Taixue]] (Imperial Academy) before. He served as a magistrate in Jiangzhou, Ba Commandery (present-day [[Chongqing]]) during the reign of [[Emperor Ming of Han]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Zhang later retired and led a reclusive life at Mount Beimang, where he practiced taoist methods of achieving [[longevity]]. When invited to serve as a ''boshi'' (equivalent of a present-day professor) in the Imperial Academy, he claimed that he was ill. [[Emperor He of Han]] summoned him thrice to serve as the ''Taifu'' (Imperial Tutor) but he refused again.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

According to [[hagiography|hagiographies]] compiled in approximately 400 C.E., in 142 C.E. the deity Taishang Laojun (a deified [[Laozi]]) revealed to Zhang on Mount Heming the "Doctrine of the Orthodox One [Resting On] the Authority of the Alliance" ({{zh|p=zhengyi mengwei dao}}), and bestowed upon him the title Celestial Master.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Lindsay. "Zhang Daoling." ''Encyclopedia of Religion''. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2005. p. 9954.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woolf2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&amp;dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Zhang+Daoling|year=2007|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deity warned that plagues, beasts, and the demons of the Three Offices and Six Heavens of the underworld were due to be released upon humankind, and that only 240,000 people would be chosen as survivors and "seed people" ({{zh|p=zhongmin}}) to populate the new age, the era of Great Peace.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Livia. ''Daoism Handbook''. Leiden: Brill, 2000. pp. 264–266.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang then endeavored to reform supposedly degenerate religious practices. After gathering numerous followers, he started a health cult that advocated certain longevity practices (recorded in books which have been lost) and founded a theocratic state in Sichuan organized into 24 parishes (later 28), which outsiders called the Way of Five Pecks of Rice after a tax of that amount levied on followers.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet, Isabelle. "Zhang Daoling." in Jones, Lindsay ed. ''Encyclopedia of Religion''. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2005. p. 9954.&lt;/ref&gt; A major change instituted by the new Covenant was the rejection of food and animal sacrifices. Also, the teachings of Laozi as transmitted by Zhang included the first true Taoist religious pantheon as distinguished from the prior ancient religion of [[China]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The ''[[Xiang'er]]'', a commentary on the ''Tao Te Ching'' preserved today in a sixth-century manuscript, is traditionally ascribed to Zhang Daoling's authorship and even if not his work may reflect his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp, Stephen R.''Early Daoist Scriptures''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997. pp.29-148. (includes full, annotated translation of the text)&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang is said to have died on [[Mount Qingcheng]] in 156 during the reign of [[Emperor Huan of Han]] at the age of 123. However, it is also said that Zhang did not die but learned the arcana of Taoism to ascend in broad daylight (''Xiandao''). Instead, his body became like luminous ether,  disappearing from eyesight and became an immortal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}
