'''132524 APL''', provisional designation {{mp|2002 JF|56}}, is a stony background [[asteroid]] in the intermediate [[asteroid belt]], approximately 2.3 kilometers across. It was imaged by the ''[[New Horizons]]'' space probe on its flyby in 2006 when it was passing though the asteroid belt. At its closest is was about 1/4 of a lunar distance away from the asteroid, which was able to be used for various tests. This flyby was incidental, and not all the instruments were online at this time, which were still being turned online during 2006.

== Description ==
[[File:Asteroid 2002 JF56.jpg|thumb|left|This has 2 images of 2002 JF56 taken by Ralph-MVIC channel. In the upper brighter image, the asteroid is viewed at a distance of 1.34 million kilometers (833,000 miles) where its about 6 times brighter than the lower, which is when it was about 3.36 million kilometers (2.1 million miles) away  from the spacecraft]]
It was discovered on 9 May 2002 by astronomers of the [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] (LINEAR) at the [[Lincoln Laboratory's ETS]] near Socorro, New Mexico, United States.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The asteroid orbits the Sun in a somewhat eccentric orbit at a distance of 1.9–3.3 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 4.2 years. Its orbit is [[orbital inclination|tilted]] off the ecliptic by 4 degrees.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

The ''[[New Horizons]]'' probe flew by it at a distance of approximately 102,000 kilometers on 13 June 2006. The spectra obtained by ''New Horizons'' show that ''APL'' is a stony [[S-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="CBET-547" /&gt;

''New Horizons'' was not intended to fly by ''APL'', and the flyby was just a coincidence. [[Alan Stern]], principal investigator for ''New Horizons'', named the asteroid in reference to the Johns Hopkins University [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] (APL), which runs the mission.&lt;ref name=mpml /&gt;

The asteroid was imaged with Ralph, but not the designed reconnaissance imager [[Long Range Reconnaissance Imager|LORRI]] because it was not turned on yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technology.org/2015/07/18/new-horizons-mission-to-pluto/|title=New Horizons Mission to Pluto|date=2015-07-18|work=Technology Org|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; LORRI was not activated until August 29, 2006 when its cover was opened and its first light image would be [[Messier 7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=090106|title=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=090106|website=pluto.jhuapl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in general possible to capitalize on the target of opportunity, and the asteroid was tracked for several days in June 2006 in addition to the other tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technology.org/2015/07/18/new-horizons-mission-to-pluto/|title=New Horizons Mission to Pluto|date=2015-07-18|work=Technology Org|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, New Horizons had passed the orbit of Mars, and the spacecraft was undergoing various course correction maneuvers and tests through out this time; as mentioned LORRI was not activated for another couple months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technology.org/2015/07/18/new-horizons-mission-to-pluto/|title=New Horizons Mission to Pluto|date=2015-07-18|work=Technology Org|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Horizons passed through asteroid belt during the summer of 2006, and the test helped prepare the team and spacecraft for the future flybys of Jupiter and Pluto in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/07/new-horizons-pluto-historic-kuiper-encounter/]&lt;/reF&gt; The [[asteroid belt]] is a feature of the solar system, consisting of a large number asteroids that orbit the sun primarily between  2.2 and 3.2 AU (Earth-Sun distance) which is between the orbits of planets [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://space-facts.com/asteroid-belt/|title=Asteroid Belt Facts - Interesting Facts about the Asteroid Belt|date=2014-09-11|work=Space Facts|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossing the asteroid belt is possible, because although there is over a million asteroids larger than 1 km the distance between them is so large spacecraft pass through empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/in-science-fiction-movies/|title=In science fiction movies, the &amp;quot;asteroid belt&amp;quot; is always pictured as a very crowded place.

''''' An Appeal to Reason: A Cool Look at Global Warming''''' is a 2008 book by [[Nigel Lawson]]. In it, Lawson argues that [[global warming]] is happening, but that the science is far from settled. He opposes the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]] as summarized by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]. He also argues that warming will bring both benefits and negative consequences, and that the impact of these changes will be relatively moderate rather than apocalyptic. He criticizes politicians and scientists who predict catastrophe unless urgent action is taken, and he calls for gradual adaptation instead. The book has been criticized by some climatologists, including IPCC authors [[Jean Palutikof]] and [[Robert Watson (scientist)|Robert Watson]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC: Lawson wrong about climate change |date=April 15, 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-19 |first=Charles |last=Clover |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/04/15/eaclimate115.xml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421025953/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fearth%2F2008%2F04%2F15%2Feaclimate115.xml |archivedate=21 April 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
This book is an expansion on Lawson’s 2006 lecture to the [[Centre for Policy Studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lord Lawson claims climate change hysteria heralds a 'new age of unreason' |date=April 6, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-27 |first=Nigel |last=Lawson |publisher=''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/earth/2008/04/06/ealawson106.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt; called "''The Economics and Politics of Climate Change. An Appeal to Reason''" &lt;ref name="Lawson2006"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lecture on the Economics and Politics of Climate Change - An Appeal to Reason |date=November 1, 2006 |accessdate=2008-09-27 |first=Nigel |last=Lawson |publisher=[[Centre for Policy Studies]] |url=http://www.cps.org.uk/cpsfile.asp?id=641 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926230110/http://www.cps.org.uk/cpsfile.asp?id=641 |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As explained in the introduction, the aim of the book is to examine each of the dimensions of the global warming issue, including the science, the economics, both from the perspective of long-term forecasting and cost-effectiveness analysis, the politics, and the ethical aspect.
The book begins by arguing that "the science of global warming is far from settled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Lawson |first= Nigel |year= 2008 |title= An Appeal to Reason: A Cool Look at Global Warming |publisher= The Overlook Press, New York |isbn= 978-1-59020-084-1 |pages= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lawson accepts that warming is real, he questions the validity of [[global climate model]]s. Specifically, he highlights the lack of [[falsifiability]] of their predictions and the fact that all models failed to predict that there has been no further warming between 2001 and 2007. He also questions if indeed the sole cause of the warming is man-made CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and how great that contribution is. Lawson raises several issues regarding the IPCC process and its findings, including the [[Hockey stick controversy]], and criticizes the [[Stern Report]]. After the introduction, the remainder of the book proceeds under the assumption that the IPCC majority view is correct.

Lawson then examines how much warming will occur and what are the practical consequences over the next hundred years, based on the 2007 IPCC Report ([[AR4]]) scenarios and policy recommendations. The next issue analyzed is the importance of adaptation, what he claims is the IPPC’s most serious flaw regarding the impact of global warming, as there is a "systematic underestimation of the benefits of adaptation" and "the most cost-effective way of addressing the likely consequences" as opposed to reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. His next criticism regards the [[Stern Review]], which he claims is "at the extreme end of the alarmist camp". He also critiques the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and the practical difficulties of reaching a global agreement. Next, he presents an analysis of the different technologies and market alternatives being implemented and available to reduce emissions, concluding with his proposal of a carbon tax across the board, together with the reduction of other taxes to compensate for the extra revenues. The book closes with a discussion about the discount rates used by the IPCC and the [[Stern Review]] in their economic analysis, with a more detailed discussion on the latter. The final chapter summarizes the book, ending with a warning about the dangers of the [[Environmentalism|environmental]] movement, calling it "the new religion of eco-fundamentalism" and claiming that "we appear to have entered a new age of unreason."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Lawson, Nigel |title= op. cit |year= 2008 |pages= 104 and 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific opinion==
James Dent reviewed the book in the [[Royal Meteorological Society]]'s journal ''Weather''.&lt;ref&gt;Dent, James, ''Weather''[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123262538/abstract Some thoughts on ''An Appeal to Reason'' by Nigel Lawson] Volume 65 Issue 2, Page 44&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Watson (scientist)|Robert Watson]], the former head of the IPCC and now chief scientist to the [[Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], accused Lawson of selective quotation and not understanding "the current scientific and economic debate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/03/climatechange.greenpolitics |title=Interview: 'They cheat, I tell you'|author=Julian Glover|date=2008-05-03|accessdate=2008-09-28|publisher=[[The Guardian]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080914041613/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/may/03/climatechange.greenpolitics| archivedate= 14 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote in a letter to a newspaper: "Lord Lawson's perspective that the UK and Europe are over-reacting to the threat of human-induced climate change is substantially wrong and ignores a significant body of scientific, technological and economic evidence."&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

[[Sir John Houghton]] reported that "Although Lawson makes some worthwhile critiques of energy policy,... his book is largely one of misleading messages." Lawson ignores or misunderstands the science, brushes off economic analysis by the [[International Energy Agency]], and lumps respected scientists with purveyors of nonsense.&lt;ref name="Houghton"/&gt; [[Jean Palutikof]], one of the authors of a new IPCC report, said: "By the time you get past 2050 the winners become fewer and fewer. By 2100, we will be losing almost everywhere."&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; She also said that Lawson's view was "very wrong" when it came to the availability of water.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

Scientists from the [[Met Office]]'s [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research|Hadley Centre]] responded to Lord Lawson's contention that there has been no global warming since 2000, saying this was due to the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|La Niña]] cooling event of early 2007.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/23/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange |title=Met Office says climate change deniers deluded |author=David Adam |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2008-09-28 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926050356/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/sep/23/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange |archivedate=26 September 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bangkok Planetarium''' is the oldest [[planetarium]] in [[Thailand]] and Southeast Asia. It is located on Sukhumvit Road in [[Bangkok]] as part of the [[Science Centre for Education]], which is operated by the Department of Non-Formal Education of the Ministry of Education.

Construction of the planetarium began in 1962 with a budget of twelve million baht and it opened on 18 August 1964. The planetarium dome is 20.60 metres in diameter and 13 metres high, and holds 450 seats. The planetarium uses a Mark IV [[Zeiss projector]], which was the first installation of a large [[planetarium projector]] in Southeast Asia. Apart from the theatre itself, the building also features permanent exhibitions on astronomy, aimed at young audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bangkok Planetarium|work=Bangkok Planetarium official website|title=ความเป็นมา (History)|publisher=Bangkok Planetarium|url=http://www.bangkokplanetarium.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=53|accessdate=2008-11-30|language=Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bangkok Planetarium|work=Bangkok Planetarium official website|title=ห้องฉายดาว|publisher=Bangkok Planetarium|url=http://www.bangkokplanetarium.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=55|accessdate=2008-11-30|language=Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planetarium underwent extensive renovations in 2015, including the installation of two new [[Christie (company)|Christie]] Boxer 4K30 projectors alongside the old Mark IV, which helped reignite interest in the previously ailing museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wangkiat|first1=Paritta|title=Stellar attraction|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/archive/news/1188897|accessdate=4 March 2017|work=Bangkok Post|date=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3568">'''Blue Gemini'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4203/ch6-2.htm NASA/USAF Blue Gemini History] Sole source reference.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) project first proposed in August 1962 for a series of seven flights of [[Gemini spacecraft]] to enable the Air Force to gain manned spaceflight experience prior to the launch of the [[Manned Orbital Development System]], or MODS. The plan was to use off-the-shelf Gemini spacecraft.

== History ==

Blue Gemini would consist of two [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) missions which would include a USAF co-pilot and would accomplish NASA objectives. These would be followed by two more NASA missions that would have USAF crews. Those missions would be devoted to NASA goals, but would include USAF experiments if possible. The final phase of Blue Gemini would consist of three dedicated USAF missions. One of these would be an [[Agena Target Vehicle]] rendezvous mission and it was possible that some of these later missions would carry only a single crew member, the other seat being occupied by experimental equipment. Possible payloads included a [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]] that would allow an [[astronaut]] to maneuver around the [[spacecraft]], an advanced [[navigation system]], an erectable structure, and a large ground mapping [[radar]]. The plan was to end Blue Gemini missions approximately four months before the debut of the MODS [[space station]].

Blue Gemini was canceled in January 1963 by [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] after he decided that military experiments could be carried aboard some NASA missions, ''i.e.,'' [[Project Gemini]]. McNamara also canceled MODS at the same time.

In December 1963 McNamara likewise approved the development of a [[Manned Orbital Laboratory]] (MOL) which was essentially a revived MODS. Blue Gemini should not be confused with the [[Gemini B]] spacecraft that was developed for MOL. Gemini B included a tunnel through its heat shield to enable the [[astronauts]] to reach the MOL spacecraft.

Because Blue Gemini was only a paper project that was canceled before NASA started any Gemini flights, no Blue Gemini hardware was constructed.  A test article on display at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] at [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], [[Ohio]] is the [[Gemini B]] spacecraft, recognized by its distinctive "US Air Force" written on the side, and the circular hatch cut through the heat shield.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150302112233/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=551 Gemini-B Spacecraft]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==
The "Blue Gemini" trilogy of novels ("Blue Gemini," "Blue Darker Than Black," and "Pale Blue")  by Mike Jenne describe a fictional "Aerospace Support Project" which used a modified version of the Gemini spacecraft to execute military IIK (Intercept-Inspect-Kill) missions against Soviet satellites suspected of carrying nuclear weapons.

An example of such a device might be a [[security appliance]] which applies [[IPsec]] protection to communications between existing devices which themselves lack IPsec implementation protocol stack.   Such a device might also be called a security gateway or  could be implemented as part of a network firewall to implement a [[tunneling protocol]].

'''Carlo Emery''' (25 October 1848, [[Naples]] &amp;ndash; 11 May 1925) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[entomologist]]. He is remembered for [[Emery's rule]], which states that insect [[social parasitism (biology)|social parasite]]s are often closely related to their hosts.

Early in his career Carlo Emery pursued a course in general medicine, and in 1872 narrowed his interests to ophthalmology. In 1878 he was appointed Professor of Zoology at the [[University of Cagliari]], remaining there for several years until 1881 when he took up an appointment at the [[University of Bologna]] as Professor of Zoology, remaining there for thirty-five years until his death. Emery specialised in [[Hymenoptera]], but his early work was on [[Coleoptera]]. Prior to 1869, his earliest works were a textbook of general zoology and papers on fishes and molluscs. From 1869 to 1925 he devoted himself almost entirely to the study of ants. &lt;ref&gt;http://gap.entclub.org/taxonomists/Emery/index.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emery published extensively between 1869 and 1926 describing  130 [[genera]] and 1057  [[species]] mainly in [[Philogène Auguste Galilée Wytsman|Wytsman's]]  ''Genera Insectorum'' series.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} 

Emery’s collections of Hymenoptera are in [[Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova]]. His Coleoptera are in [[Museo Civico di Zoologia]] di Roma. He died at Bologna in 1925.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''EJB QL''' or '''EJB-QL''' is a portable [[database]] [[query language]] for [[Enterprise Java Beans]]. It was used in [[Java EE]] applications. Compared to SQL, however, it is less complex but less powerful as well.&lt;ref&gt;See the Introduction (p. 4) of »''expert one-on-one: J2EE Design and Development''«, (c) 2002 wrox press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The language has been inspired, especially EJB3-QL, by the native Hibernate Query Language [[HQL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/entitymanager/reference/en/html/queryhql.html Chapter 7. EJB-QL: The Object Query Language]&lt;/ref&gt;

In EJB3 It has been mostly replaced by the [[Java Persistence Query Language]].

==Differences==
EJB QL is a database query language similar to SQL. The used queries are somewhat different from relational SQL, as it uses a so-called "abstract schema" of the enterprise beans instead of the relational model. In other words, EJB QL queries do not use tables and their components, but enterprise beans, their persistent state, and their relationships. The result of an SQL query is a set of rows with a fixed number of columns. The result of an EJB QL query is either a single object, a collection of entity objects of a given type, or a collection of values retrieved from [[Container-Managed Persistence|CMP]] fields. One has to understand the data model of enterprise beans in order to write effective queries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://java.sun.com/developer/EJTechTips/2003/tt0929.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513195535/http://java.sun.com/developer/EJTechTips/2003/tt0929.html |archivedate=2008-05-13|title=ADVANCED EJB QL: SQL vs. EJB QL: Relational and Object Query Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

!Short Description
|-
| Rowing
| The physiology and biomechanics of rowers and rowing techniques have been widely studied, but most of the studies were conducted in laboratory settings, as measuring equipment is often laborary based and can not be used on the boat. To enable real-time monitoring of athletes' physiology and capturing biomechanical indices, a number of pervasive sensing devices have been developed under the ESPRIT programme.

| To understand the biomechanics of a swim is often difficult, as tradition measuring tools cannot be used under water. In most cases, the biomechanic indices can only be captured by swimmers simulating the swimming movements in dry land. Under the ESPRIT programme, a number of wireless sensing technologies have been developed aimming to provide a real-time unobtrusive monitoring system for elite swimmers.

'''''Eyewire''''' is a game to map the brain from [[Sebastian Seung]]'s Lab at [[Princeton University]]. This [[citizen science]] [[human-based computation game]] challenges players to map [[retina|retinal]] [[neuron]]s. Eyewire launched on December 10, 2012. Over five years, 250,000 people from 150 countries have signed up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eyewire.org/5-years-of-eyewire//|title=5 Years of Eyewire|date=7 December 2017|website=Blog.eyewire.org|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game utilizes data generated by the [[Max Planck Institute for Medical Research]].&lt;ref name="About Eyewire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eyewire.org/about/|title=About &lt;&lt; Eyewire|accessdate=April 17, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213150425/http://eyewire.org/about/|archivedate=February 13, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing requires no scientific background.

==Gameplay==
Eyewire challenges players, "Eyewirers", to map neurons in 3D. Upon registering, players are directed through a tutorial that explains the game. Supplementary [http://blog.eyewire.org/?s=tutorials video tutorials] are available on the Eyewire Blog.

In Eyewire, the player is given a cube with a partially reconstructed neuron branch stretching through it. On the right side of the screen is a grayscale image of the cross sections of neurons. The player learns to "color" inside a gray outline of a single neuron branch, which usually extends from one side of the cube to another. As a player colors, segmentations that were generated by AI are added to the 3D section on the left of the screen. Reconstructions are compared across players as each cube is submitted, yielding a consensus reconstruction that is later checked by expert players of rank Scout and Scythe. These players have the power to extend branches, remove erroneous segments (nicknamed "mergers"), and flag cubes for further review. This end result is volumetric reconstructions of complete neurons.
===Scoring===
Each volume is presented to two to five different players. Generally, the trace chosen by the majority of accurate players is accepted. Players win points based on whether their tracing matches the majority of other players' tracings, time spent on the cube, and the new amount of neural volume found.

==Goal==
The goal of Eyewire is to identify and classify specific cell types as well as potentially expand the known broad classes of retinal cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.eyewire.org/index.php?title=E2198|title=E2198 - Eyewire|website=Wiki.eyewire.org|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=January 2018}} Eyewire aims to advance the use of artificial intelligence in neuronal reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seunglab.org/courses/neuralnets15/|title=Neural networks: Theory and Applications|website=Seunglab.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project aims to help determine how mammals see directional motion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eyewire.org/retina |title=Retina &lt;&lt; Eyewire |accessdate=March 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324121236/http://eyewire.org/retina/ |archivedate=March 24, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eyewire.org/|title=Eyewire|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over 1,000 neurons mapped by Eyewirers may be explored on the Eyewire Museum, a browser-based visualization tool that pairs anatomical and functional data. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://museum.eyewire.org/about|title=Museum {{!}} Eyewire|website=museum.eyewire.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
The activity of each neuron in a 350×300×60 μm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; portion of a retina was determined by [[two-photon microscopy]].&lt;ref name="challenge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eyewire.org/challenge/|title=Challenge &lt;&lt; Eyewire|accessdate=March 27, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414005627/http://eyewire.org/challenge/|archivedate=April 14, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[serial block-face scanning electron microscopy]], the same volume was [[cell staining|stained]] to bring out the contrast of the [[plasma membrane]]s, sliced into layers by a [[microtome]], and imaged using an [[electron microscope]].

A neuron is selected by the researchers. The program chooses a cubic volume associated with that neuron for the player, along with an [[artificial intelligence]]'s best guess for tracing the neuron through the two-dimensional images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.eyewire.org/discussion/8/very-small-sections-of-neuron-#Item_11|title=Very small sections of neuron|author=Sebastian Seung|quote=A few more words of explanation for the curious...you color neurons on Eyewire by guiding an artificial intelligence (AI).

It originally appeared in the [[Disney comics|Disney comic]] "[[Flip Decision]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Barks, Carl|penciller=Barks, Carl|inker=Barks, Carl|colorist=|letterer=Barks, Garé|editor=|story=|title=Flip Decision|volume=13|issue=5|date=1953|publisher=Walt Disney Comics &amp; Stories|location=|page=

Barks called a practitioner of "Flipism" a "Flippist" (with two P's).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Philosophy of Flipism |url=https://www.seriesam.com/barks/cr_comicswdc.html#ccus_wdc0149-01_l_credits |publisher=Seriesam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=W WDC 149-01 the philosophy of flipism |url=https://www.seriesam.com/barks/comicswdc148.html#ccus_wdc0149-01 |publisher=Seriesam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An actual coin is not necessary: [[dice]] or another [[random generator]] may be used for [[decision making]].

Flipism can be seen as a [[normative]] [[decision theory]], although it does not fulfill the criteria of [[rationality]].

==History==
In the 1952 comic book, [[Donald Duck]] meets Professor Batty, who persuades Donald to make decisions based on flipping a coin at every crossroad of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rastetter-wacker.de/Barks-Flipism.htm|title=Flip Decision|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719074118/http://www.rastetter-wacker.de/Barks-Flipism.htm|archive-date=July 19, 2011|publisher=Rastetter|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Life is but a gamble! Let flipism chart your ramble!" Donald soon gets into trouble when following this advice. He drives a one way road in the wrong direction and is fined $50. The reason for the fine is not the bad driving but letting the coin do the thinking.&lt;ref name="liberty"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://lfs.org/newsletter/029/02/Prometheus_2902.pdf |last1=Salin |first1=Phillip |format=[[PDF]] |title=Appreciation: Scrooge McDuck and His Creator |volume=29 |number=2 |magazine=[[Liberty Magazine]], [[Prometheus]] |date=Winter 2011 |origyear=1988 |accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, there are those who view the resort to Flipism to be a disavowal of responsibility for making personal and societal decisions based upon rationality.&lt;ref name="liberty"/&gt; However, in the end, flipism shows surprising efficiency in guiding some decisions.&lt;ref name="liberty"/&gt;

==In decision-making==
Flipism is a normative [[decision theory]] in a sense that it prescribes how decisions should be made. In the comic, flipism shows remarkable ability to make right conclusions without any information – but only once in a while. Of course, in real life flipping a coin would only lead to random decisions. However, there is an article about benefits of some randomness in the decision-making process in certain conditions. It notes:&lt;ref name="Wärneryd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubchoicesoc.org/papers_2008/warneryd.pdf|title=Religion, Ritual, and Randomization|author=Wärneryd, Karl|date=January 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727191123/http://pubchoicesoc.org/papers_2008/warneryd.pdf|archive-date=July 27, 2011|publisher=|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Though the author himself may have intended this as a rejection of the idea that rationality (in the standard sense) has some special claim to superiority as a basis for making decisions, what he may really have discovered are the potential benefits of strategic commitment to randomization.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Commitment to a non-trivial mixed strategy can be beneficial for the informed party in a potential conflict under asymmetric information, as it allows the player to manipulate his opponent’s beliefs in an optimal fashion. Such a strategy also makes the player less inclined to enter into conflict when it is avoidable. Coins and "flipism" have been used to suggest mathematical outcomes to a variation of the [[Prisoners Dilemma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/wagon/fall05/p1045.html |title= Meta Dilemma|author=Velleman, Dan|publisher=Mathforum|date=November 28, 2005|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of seeing the utility of flipism in decision-making can be called [[revealed preference]]s. In the traditional form, revealed preferences mean that the preferences of consumers can be revealed by their purchasing habits. With flipism, the preferences can be revealed to the decision-maker themselves. Decisions with conflicting preferences are especially difficult even in situations where there is only one decision-maker and no uncertainty. The decision options may be either all appealing or all unpleasant, and therefore the decision-maker is unable to choose. Flipism, ''i.e.'', flipping a coin can be used to find a solution. However, the decision-maker should not decide based on the coin but instead observe his or her own feelings about the outcome; whether it was relieving or agonizing. In this way, flipism removes the mental block related to the act of decision-making, and the post-decision preferences can be revealed before the decision is actually made. An example of revealed preferences is embodied in the [[Old Testament]] story, the [[Judgment of Solomon]], wherein [[King Solomon]] offered to resolve a [[child custody]] dispute by ordering the baby cut in two, and upon seeing the reactions made an award.

Still a third approach is to look at flipism as the endpoint of a continuum bounded on the other side by perfectly [[Rational choice theory|rational decision-making]]. Flipism requires the minimum possible cognitive overhead to make decisions, at the price of making sub-optimal choices. Truly rational decision-making requires a tremendous investment in information and cognition to arrive at an optimal decision. However, the expected [[marginal value]] of information gathered (discounted for risk and uncertainty) is often lower than the [[marginal cost]] of the information or processing itself. The concept of [[bounded rationality]] posits that people employ [[Cognitive miser|cognitive parsimony]], gathering only what they expect to be sufficient information to arrive at a [[satisficing]] (or "good enough") solution. Flipism is therefore a rational strategy to employ when the cost of information is very high relative to its expected value, and using it is an example of [[motivated tactician|motivated tactical thinking]].

This is a commonly recognized [[decision making]] technique used in everyday life.  Other similar methods include:
# [[coin flipping]], cutting a deck of playing cards, [[Bibliomancy|finding a quotation in a holy book]], consulting the [[Magic 8-ball]], rolling a die, and other random or coincidence methods;
# accepting the first option that seems like it might achieve the desired result (known as [[satisficing]]), given the marginal effort involved in trying to process the information and optimize the result;
# [[astrology]], [[augury]], [[fortune cookies]], [[prayer]], [[tarot cards]], [[revelation]], [[Methods of divination]] or other forms of [[divination]] or [[Oracle|oracular device]]; and
# Highest Paid Person's Opinion (HiPPO).&lt;ref name="Ramakrishnan"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mlAsDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT128|title=Big Data Analytics Using Multiple Criteria Decision-Making Models |editor-last1=Ramakrishnan |editor-first1=Ramanathan|pages=128-129 |editor-last2=Muthu |editor-first2=Mathirajan |editor-first3=A. Ravi |editor-last3=Ravindran |location=Boca Raton, Florida |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis Group]], [[CRC Press]]|date=July 12, 2017 |isbn=9781351648691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These forms are in contradistinction to [[Analytics]], a commonly used method of data-based decision making.&lt;ref name="Ramakrishnan"/&gt;

According to Kevin Durand and Mary Leigh, Flipism is “a psychological tool, and not an agent of fate.”&lt;ref name=”Durand”&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5hrOKmZv_AkC&amp;pg=PA202 |page=202 |title=Riddle Me This, Batman!: Essays on the Universe of the Dark Knight |first1=Kevin K. |last1=Durand |first2=Mary K. |last2=Leigh |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |date=September 12, 2011 |isbn=9780786487318}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is neither a revelation of the wishes of the head of state (''e.g.'', [[Julius Caesar]], whose head was on the coin, ''ergo'', heads showed 'Caesar's will') nor the divination of a deity's will.&lt;ref name=”Durand”/&gt;

==Similar concepts==
In [[game theory]], [[negotiations]], [[nuclear deterrence]], [[diplomacy]] and other [[Conflict resolution|Conflict theory]] – [[rationality]], [[realpolitik]] or [[Realism in international relations|realism]] can themselves limit strategies and results.  They can limit the ability of a player to make demands or get its own way through [[Boast|bluff]], [[Bullying|bully]], instill [[fear]], cause [[apprehension (fear)|apprehension]], or [[Psychological manipulation|psychologically manipulate]] or send a heeded warning—and therefore can increase the likelihood that an opposing party may engage in objectionable or unwelcome behavior. If one knows the lines and can predict the response, then [[predictability]] and [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]] become a restraint, not a [[virtue]]. Consequently, 'taunting a junkyard dog{{efn|An aggressive dog that guards a scrap yard or junkyard}} is OK, if you know you are beyond the reach of its [[tether]].'&lt;ref name="Wärneryd"/&gt; Thus irrationality (real or perceived) can be an important countervailing tool or strategy, particularly as a [[deterrence theory|deterrent]] and if it engenders hesitation, fear, negotiation and resolution, or change of course.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2601362 Kahler, Mark. ''Rationality in International Relations'' International Organization, Vol. 52, No. 4, ''International Organization at Fifty: Exploration and Contestation in the Study of World Politics'' (Autumn, 1998), pp. 919-941 © 1998] [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, alternate strategies such as [[honesty]], building a climate of trust, [[respect]], using [[intermediaries]], [[mediation]] or other forms of [[conflict resolution]], [[wikt:sanction|sanctions]], [[patience]], [[wikt:process|process]], [[data]] and [[reasoning]] might still be available, as might strategies like so-called win/win [[bargaining]] (also called "interest-based" bargaining) – which tries to reach an accord based on interests, not necessarily on [[positions]], [[Power (philosophy)|power]], [[rights]] or [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/interest-based_bargaining/ |title=Integrative or interest-based bargaining |publisher=Beyondintractability|date= |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==In popular culture==
Flipism is a film [[trope (cinema)|trope]] that is used to argue for “the supremacy of free will in a chaotic world.” &lt;ref name=”Durand”/&gt; It is a recurrent theme, often seen on television and other media, and even in real life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsOrTails |title=Heads or Tails? |publisher=[[TV Tropes]] |accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Whenever you're called on to make up your mind, and you're hampered by not having any, the best way to solve the dilemma, you'll find, is simply by spinning a penny. No -- not so that chance shall decide the affair, while you're passively standing there moping, but the moment the penny is up in the air, you suddenly know what you're hoping.

'''Frederick Robert Schram''' (born August 11, 1943 in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]]) is an [[Americans|American]] [[palaeontologist]] and [[carcinologist]]. He received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[biology]] from [[Loyola University Chicago]] in 1965, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] on palaeozoology from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1968&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref name="Watling"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Journal of Crustacean Biology]] |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=99–101 |year=2006 |title=Frederick R.

He has written over 200 papers on various aspects of [[crustacea]]n [[biology]], [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and [[systematics]], as well as several books, including the standard text ''Crustacea''&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ISBN=0-19-503742-1 |title=Crustacea |author=Frederick R. Schram |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1986 |pages=606}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, he founded the journal ''[[Crustacean Issues]]'', which he continued to edit for over twenty years. Much of his career has been spent at the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]], from which he retired in 2005. In July 2005, he became the Editor of the ''[[Journal of Crustacean Biology]]''&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref name="Watling"/&gt;

[[Maria Zuber]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] is GRAIL's principal investigator. [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] manages the project. {{As of|2011|8|5|df=US}}, the program has cost US$496 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Yahoo News | title=NASA Spacecraft Begins 5-Year Trip to Jupiter | author=Marcia Dunn, AP Aerospace Writer | date=5 August 2011| url=https://news.yahoo.com/nasa-spacecraft-begins-5-trip-jupiter-211124283.html | accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon launch the spacecraft were named GRAIL A and GRAIL B and a contest was opened to school children to select names.  Nearly 900 classrooms from 45 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, participated in the contest.  The winning names, Ebb and Flow, were suggested by 4th grade students at [[Emily Dickinson Elementary School]] in [[Bozeman, Montana]].&lt;ref name=ebbflow/&gt;

Each [[spacecraft]] transmitted and received [[telemetry]] from the other spacecraft and Earth-based facilities. By measuring the change in distance between the two spacecraft, the gravity field and geological structure of the Moon was obtained. The two spacecraft were able to detect very small changes in the distance between one another. Changes in distance as small as one [[micron]] were detectable and measurable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120009915_2012010042.pdf GRAVITY RECOVERY AND INTERIOR LABORATORY (GRAIL) MISSION: STATUS AT THE INITIATION OF THE SCIENCE MAPPING PHASE, 43rd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/post/nasa-to-crash-probes-into-the-moon/2012/12/17/2f2d2b80-4871-11e2-b6f0-e851e741d196_blog.html Washington Post December 17, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gravitational field]] of the Moon was mapped in unprecedented detail.&lt;ref name="AboutGRAIL"&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=About GRAIL | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology | date= | url=http://moon.mit.edu/index.html | accessdate = 2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
* Map the structure of the lunar [[crust (geology)|crust]] and [[lithosphere]]
* Understand the asymmetric thermal evolution of the Moon
* Determine the subsurface structure of [[impact basin]]s and the origin of lunar [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]]
* Ascertain the temporal evolution of crustal [[brecciation]] and [[magmatism]]
* Constrain the deep interior structure of the Moon
* Place limits on the size of the Moon's [[inner core]]

The data collection phase of the mission lasted from 7 Mar 2012 to 29 May 2012, for a total of 88 days.

Unlike the [[Apollo program]] missions, which took three days to reach the Moon, GRAIL made use of a three- to four-month low-energy trans-lunar cruise well outside the Moon's orbit and passing near the Sun-Earth [[Lagrange point#L1|Lagrange point L1]] before looping back to rendezvous with the Moon.  This extended and circuitous trajectory enabled the mission to reduce fuel requirements, protect instruments and reduce the velocity of the two spacecraft at lunar arrival to help achieve the extremely low {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} orbits with separation between the spacecraft (arriving 25 hours apart) of {{convert|175|to|225|km||abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="MIT-overview"&gt;{{cite web | title=GRAIL: Mission Overview | publisher  = [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] | url=http://moon.mit.edu/overview.html | accessdate = 10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MissionDesign"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mission Design | url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/grail/missiondesign.cfm | publisher=NASA | accessdate=10 September 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003144042/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/grail/missiondesign.cfm | archivedate=3 October 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The very tight tolerances in the flight plan left little room for error correction leading to a launch window lasting one second and providing only two launch opportunities per day.&lt;ref name='launch windows'&gt;{{cite news | author= Justin Ray | title=GRAIL Launch Window Chart | url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/delta/d356/windows.html | work=SpaceFlight Now | date=17 August 2011 | accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science phase===
The primary science phase of GRAIL lasted for 88 days, from 7 Mar 2012 to 29 May 2012. It was followed by a second science phase starting on 8 Aug.

The gravity mapping technique was similar to that used by [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE), and the spacecraft design was based on [[XSS-11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Taylor Dinerman | title = Is XSS-11 the answer to America’s quest for Operationally Responsive Space? | work=The Space Review | date= 31 December 2007 | url= http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1026/1 | accessdate=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The orbital insertion dates were {{Start date|2011|12|31}} (for GRAIL-A) and {{Start date|2012|01|01}} (for GRAIL-B).&lt;ref name=LaunchCBS/&gt;

The spacecraft were operated over the 88-day acquisition phase, divided into three 27.3 day long [[nadir]]-pointed mapping cycles. Twice each day there was an 8-hour pass in view of the [[Deep Space Network]] for transmission of science and "E/PO MoonKam" data.&lt;ref name="design MIT"&gt;{{cite web | title= GRAIL: Mission Design | url= http://moon.mit.edu/design.html | publisher= [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final experiment and mission end===
At the end of the science phase and a mission extension, the spacecrafts were powered down and decommissioned over a five-day period. The spacecraft impacted the lunar surface on December 17, 2012.&lt;ref name="design MIT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= NASA GRAIL Twins Complete Their Moon Impact | url= http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/grail/news/grailstatus20121217.html

[[File:HubbleTuningFork.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Tuning-fork-style diagram of the [[Hubble sequence]]]]

'''Galaxy morphological classification''' is a system used by [[astronomer]]s to divide [[galaxy|galaxies]] into groups based on their visual appearance. There are several schemes in use by which galaxies can be classified according to their morphologies, the most famous being the [[Hubble sequence]], devised by [[Edwin Hubble]] and later expanded by [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]] and [[Allan Sandage]].

== Hubble sequence ==
{{main|Hubble sequence}}
[[File:A remarkable galactic hybrid.jpg|thumb|Spiral galaxy [[UGC 12591]] is classified as an S0/Sa galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A remarkable galactic hybrid|url=https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1709a/|website=www.spacetelescope.org|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Hubble sequence is a morphological classification scheme for [[galaxies]] invented by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="hubble26a"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubble |first=E. P. |authorlink=Edwin Hubble |date=1926 |title=Extra-galactic nebulae |journal=Contributions from the Mount Wilson Observatory / Carnegie Institution of Washington |volume=324 |pages=1–49|bibcode = 1926CMWCI.324....1H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hubble |first=E. P. |authorlink=Edwin Hubble |title=The Realm of the Nebulae |date=1936 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven |lccn=36018182}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is often known colloquially as the “Hubble tuning-fork” because of the shape in which it is traditionally represented. Hubble’s scheme divides galaxies into three broad classes based on their visual appearance (originally on [[photographic plate]]s):
* '''[[Elliptical galaxy|Elliptical galaxies]]''' have smooth, featureless light distributions and appear as ellipses in images. They are denoted by the letter "E", followed by an integer ''n'' representing their degree of ellipticity on the sky.
* '''[[Spiral galaxy|Spiral galaxies]]''' consist of a flattened disk, with [[star]]s forming a (usually two-armed) [[spiral]] structure, and a central concentration of stars known as the [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]], which is similar in appearance to an [[elliptical galaxy]]. They are given the symbol "S". Roughly half of all spirals are also observed to have a bar-like structure, extending from the central bulge. These [[barred spiral galaxy|barred spirals]] are given the symbol "SB".
* '''[[Lenticular galaxy|Lenticular galaxies]]''' (designated S0) also consist of a bright central [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]] surrounded by an extended, disk-like structure but, unlike [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], the disks of lenticular galaxies have no visible spiral structure and are not actively forming stars in any significant quantity.

[[File:The Hubble Sequence throughout the Universe's history.jpg|thumb|300px|The Hubble sequence throughout the universe's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hubble explores the origins of modern galaxies|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1315/|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=ESA/Hubble Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

These broad classes can be extended to enable finer distinctions of appearance and to encompass other types of galaxies, such as [[irregular galaxy|irregular galaxies]], which have no obvious regular structure (either disk-like or ellipsoidal).

The Hubble sequence is often represented in the form of a two-pronged fork, with the ellipticals on the left (with the degree of ellipticity increasing from left to right) and the barred and unbarred spirals forming the two parallel prongs of the fork. Lenticular galaxies are placed between the ellipticals and the spirals, at the point where the two prongs meet the “handle”.

To this day, the Hubble sequence is the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, both in professional astronomical research and in [[amateur astronomy]].

More modern observations of galaxies have given us the following information about these types:

* Elliptical galaxies are generally fairly low in gas and dust, and are composed mostly of older stars.
* Spiral galaxies generally have plentiful supplies of gas and dust, and have a broad mix of older and younger stars.
* Irregular galaxies are fairly rich in gas, dust, and young stars.

From this, astronomers have constructed a theory of galaxy evolution which suggests that ellipticals are, in fact, the result of collisions between spiral and/or irregular galaxies, which strip out much of the gas and dust and randomize the [[orbit]]s of the stars. See [[galaxy formation and evolution]].

The de Vaucouleurs system for classifying galaxies is a widely used extension to the [[Hubble sequence]], first described by [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=De Vaucouleurs |first=G. |authorlink=Gérard de Vaucouleurs|date=1959 |title=Classification and Morphology of External Galaxies |journal=Handbuch der Physik |volume=53 |pages=275|bibcode = 1959HDP....53..275D }}&lt;/ref&gt; De Vaucouleurs argued that Hubble's two-dimensional classification of [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]]—based on the tightness of the spiral arms and the presence or absence of a bar—did not adequately describe the full range of observed galaxy morphologies. In particular, he argued that [[torus|rings]] and [[lens (geometry)|lenses]] are important structural components of spiral galaxies.&lt;ref name="binney_merrifield"&gt;{{cite book |last=Binney |first=J. |authorlink=James Binney |author2=Merrifield, M. |title=Galactic Astronomy |date=1998 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location=Princeton |isbn=978-0-691-02565-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The de Vaucouleurs system retains Hubble’s basic division of galaxies into [[elliptical galaxy|ellipticals]], [[lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]], [[spiral galaxy|spirals]] and [[irregular galaxy|irregulars]]. To complement Hubble’s scheme, de Vaucouleurs introduced a more elaborate classification system for spiral galaxies, based on three morphological characteristics:

{{unordered list
&lt;!-- this list is coded to allow proper formatting of the final item in which the first-level paragraph continues after the sublist --&gt;
|1= '''Bars.''' Galaxies are divided on the basis of the presence or absence of a nuclear bar. De Vaucouleurs introduced the notation SA to denote spiral galaxies without bars, complementing Hubble’s use of SB for barred spirals. He also allowed for an intermediate class, denoted SAB, containing weakly barred spirals.&lt;ref name="Class"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Vaucouleurs|first=Gérard|title=Revised Classification of 1500 Bright Galaxies|journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement|date=April 1963|volume=8|page=31|doi=10.1086/190084|bibcode = 1963ApJS....8...31D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lenticular galaxies are also classified as unbarred (SA0) or barred (SB0), with the notation S0 reserved for those galaxies for which it is impossible to tell if a bar is present or not (usually because they are edge-on to the line-of-sight).

|2= '''Rings.''' Galaxies are divided into those possessing ring-like structures (denoted ‘(r)’) and those without rings (denoted ‘(s)’). So-called ‘transition’ galaxies are given the symbol (rs).&lt;ref name="Class"/&gt;

|3= '''Spiral arms.''' As in Hubble’s original scheme, spiral galaxies are assigned to a class based primarily on the tightness of their spiral arms. The de Vaucouleurs scheme extends the arms of Hubble’s tuning fork to include several additional spiral classes:
{{unordered list
  |1= Sd (SBd) - diffuse, broken arms made up of individual stellar clusters and nebulae; very faint central bulge
  |2= Sm (SBm) - irregular in appearance; no bulge component
  |3= Im - highly irregular galaxy
  }}
Most galaxies in these three classes were classified as Irr I in Hubble’s original scheme. In addition, the Sd class contains some galaxies from Hubble’s Sc class. Galaxies in the classes Sm and Im are termed the [[Magellanic spiral|“Magellanic” spirals]] and irregulars, respectively, after the [[Magellanic Clouds]]. The [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] is of type SBm, while the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] is an irregular (Im).
}}

The different elements of the classification scheme are combined — in the order in which they are listed — to give the complete classification of a galaxy. For example, a weakly barred spiral galaxy with loosely wound arms and a ring is denoted SAB(r)c.

Visually, the de Vaucouleurs system can be represented as a [http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/classify.html three-dimensional version] of Hubble’s tuning fork, with stage (spiralness) on the ''x''-axis, family (barredness) on the ''y''-axis, and variety (ringedness) on the ''z''-axis.&lt;ref name="deVaucouleurs1994"&gt;{{cite journal | first = G. | last = De Vaucouleurs | authorlink = Gérard de Vaucouleurs | title = Global Physical Parameters of Galaxies | date = 1994 | url = http://www.stsci.edu/institute/conference/galaxy-morphology/devaucouleurs.ps | format = [[PostScript]] | accessdate = 2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numerical Hubble stage===
De Vaucouleurs also assigned numerical values to each class of galaxy in his scheme. Values of the numerical Hubble stage ''T'' run from −6 to +10, with negative numbers corresponding to early-type galaxies (ellipticals and lenticulars) and positive numbers to late types (spirals and irregulars). Elliptical galaxies are divided into three 'stages': compact ellipticals (cE), normal ellipticals (E) and late types (E&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Lenticulars are similarly subdivided into early (S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), intermediate (S&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) and late (S&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) types. Irregular galaxies can be of type magellanic irregulars (''T'' = 10) or 'compact' (''T'' = 11).

== Yerkes (or Morgan) scheme ==
Created by American astronomer [[William Wilson Morgan]].  Together with [[Philip Childs Keenan|Philip Keenan]], Morgan developed the MK system for the classification of stars through their spectra. The Yerkes scheme uses the spectra of stars in the galaxy; the shape, real and apparent; and the degree of the central concentration to classify galaxies.

The '''Goodman fatigue equation''' is used by engineers for [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] analysis. The equation is used to make [[correlation]]s of experimental fatigue data of [[metals]] and other materials.

The equation is also used to determine the failure mechanisms of sucker rods in pumping [[oil well]]s worldwide, and to help design new sucker rod strings for rod-pumped oil wells.

== Sources ==
From similar triangles the Goodman fatigue equation is :

( 4a)         τm /Sus + τa /Ses   =   1/n       in which the stress components are given by 
                                      τm   =   Ks 8 FmC / πd2     where   Fm   =   ( Fhi + Flo ) /2     and 
                                      τa   =   Kh 8 Fa C / πd2    where   Fa   =   ( Fhi - Flo ) /2

In 2016, Fry co-presented the television programme ''[[Trainspotting Live]]'' with [[Peter Snow]], a three-part series about trains and trainspotting, for [[BBC Four|BBC 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/meet-the-stars-of-new-tv-show-trainspotting-live/ |title=Meet the stars of new TV show 'Trainspotting Live' |publisher=thetelegraph.co.uk |date=11 July 2016 |accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also hosted ''The Joy of Data,'' which examines the history of data and how they affect us today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07lk6tj|title=The Joy of Data|author=|date=|website=BBC Four|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further credit for the year was her co-hosting an episode of UK TV series ''[[Horizon_(UK_TV_series)|Horizon]]'' with [[Chris_van_Tulleken|Dr Xand van Tulleken]] titled "[[List_of_Horizon_episodes#Series_52:_2016-2017|How to Find Love Online]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0791nhx|title=How to Find Love Online, 2016, Horizon|author=|date=|website=BBC Two|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Fry presented an episode of ''Horizon'' titled ''10 Things You Need to Know About the Future''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b08w61hc/ |title=10 Things You Need to Know About the Future |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=19 June 2017 |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she presented ''Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic'', a programme about the possible impact of a flu pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p059y0p1 |title=Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=22 March 2018 |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fry has featured in several videos for a [[YouTube]] mathematics channel, [[Numberphile]], run by [[Brady Haran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://numberphile.com/team/index.html|title=The Team|publisher=Numberphile|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hannah Fry hosted a one-off 90-minute special of the [[BBC]] science programme ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' along with four presenters from the show’s original run, [[Maggie Philbin]], [[Howard Stableford]], [[Judith Hann]] and Peter Snow. The show was broadcast at 9pm on BBC 4 on 22 November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/03/bbc-to-reboot-tomorrows-world-for-one-off-live-special&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Fry has published three books. The first, ''The Mathematics of Love'', includes the "37% rule", a form of the [[secretary problem]] according to which roughly the first third of any potential partners should be rejected. The second, ''The Indisputable Existence of Santa Claus'' (co-authored with fellow mathematician, Thomas Oléron Evans), discusses various Christmas-related topics and how mathematics can be involved in them, including a fair [[Secret Santa]], decoration of [[Christmas tree]]s, winning at ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', and comparing the vocabulary of the [[Queen's Christmas message]] to [[Snoop Dogg]].&lt;ref name=grauniad/&gt;

[[File:RP English diphthongs chart.svg|thumb|shows the part of and the height of the tongue involved in the articulation of /aʊ/]]
"'''How now brown cow'''" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aʊ|_|ˈ|n|aʊ|_|ˈ|b|r|aʊ|n|_|ˈ|k||aʊ}}) is a phrase used in [[elocution]] teaching to demonstrate [[Roundedness|rounded]] [[vowel]] sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ordinary Parent's Guide to Teaching Reading|last=Wise|first=Jessie|last2=Buffington|first2=Sara|publisher=Peace Hill Press|year=2004|isbn=978-09-72860-31-4|location=Charles City, VA|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each "ow" sound in the phrase represents the [[diphthong]] /aʊ/. Although [[orthographies]] for each of the four words in this utterance is represented by the English spelling "ow", the articulation required to create this same diphthong represented by the [[International Phonetic Association|International Phonetic Association's]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|phonetic alphabet]] as /aʊ/ is also represented by the spelling "ou". Some examples of these [[homophonic]] /aʊ/'s are the English words "house", "blouse", "noun", and "cloud". The use of the phrase "how now brown cow" in teaching elocution can be dated back to at least 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Bagley, Louie: "Elocution do's and dont's", Frederick A. Stokes Company, 1926&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not in use today, the phrase "how now" is a greeting, short for "how say you now", and can be found in archaic literature, such as the plays of [[William Shakespeare]].

In [[optics]], an '''image-forming optical system''' is a system capable of being used for [[Image|imaging]]. The diameter of the aperture of the main objective is a common criterion for comparison among optical systems, such as large telescopes.

The two traditional systems are [[mirror]]-systems ([[catoptrics]]) and [[lens (optics)|lens]]-systems ([[dioptrics]]), although in the late twentieth century, [[optical fiber]] was introduced. Catoptrics and dioptrics have a [[Focus (optics)|focal point]], while optical fiber transfers an image from one plane to another without an optical focus.

[[Isaac Newton]] is reported to have designed what he called a ''[[catadioptric]]al phantasmagoria'', which can be interpreted to mean an elaborate structure of both mirrors and lenses.

Catoptrics and optical fiber have no [[chromatic aberration]], while dioptrics need to have this error corrected. Newton believed that such correction was impossible, because he thought the path of the light depended only on its color. In 1757 [[John Dollond]] was able to create an achromatised dioptric, which was the forerunner of the [[photographic lens|lenses]] used in all popular photographic equipment today.

Lower-energy X-Rays are the highest energy electromagnetic radiation that can be formed into an image, using a [[Wolter telescope]]. There are three types of Wolter telescopes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Glancing Incidence Mirror Systems as Imaging Optics for X-rays |author=Wolter, H. |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=10 |pages=94 |date=1952 |doi=10.1002/andp.19524450108|bibcode = 1952AnP...445...94W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Verallgemeinerte Schwarzschildsche Spiegelsysteme streifender Reflexion als Optiken für Röntgenstrahlen |author=Wolter, H. |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=10 |pages=286 |date=1952 |doi=10.1002/andp.19524450410|bibcode = 1952AnP...445..286W }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Near infrared]] is typically the longest wavelength that are handled optically, such as in some large telescopes.

The '''International Union of Biological Sciences''' ('''IUBS''') is a [[non-profit organization]] and [[non-governmental organization]], founded in 1919, that promotes the biological sciences internationally. As a scientific umbrella organization it was a founding member of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU).

== Objectives ==
The union has several key objectives:
* to promote the study of [[biological sciences]];
* to initiate, facilitate and coordinate research and other scientific activities necessitating international, interdisciplinary cooperation;
* to ensure the discussion and dissemination of the results of cooperative research, particularly in connection with IUBS scientific programmes;
* to support the organisation of international conferences and assist in the publication of their reports.

== Networking and cooperation ==
The Union was a founding member of the [[ICSU]] Scientific Committee and works closely with [[UNESCO]]. It also maintains relations with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP). It cooperates with the [[European Commission]] and numerous other organizations, agencies and foundations.

== Organisation ==
The Union currently consists of:
* 44 national members, consisting of national science academies, research and scientific organizations,
* 80 scientific members, including international scientific associations, societies or commissions of the various biological disciplines, from [[biology]] to [[zoology]]. New members are allowed under strict scientific guidelines.

The national and the academic members identify promising areas of biological science and bring them to the attention of the Union and in the reverse, promote the programs of the Union in their own country to stimulate research projects. The Union reviews the member's suggestions, checks them against the international academic and scientific-political background and develops the programs, if they have sufficient support. Approval is given in the General Assembly and the project progresses through international conferences for accreditation and then implementation through national or international funding agencies.

=== Board ===
The Executive Committee consists of: the President, the former President, two Vice-Presidents, the Secretary, the Treasurer and other members of the Extended Board. The Board meets annually. The Secretariat, with its Executive Director coordinates the programs and activities.

=== General Assembly ===
In the General Assembly, each national member has one vote. The scientific members are invited to send one representative each to the talks and make programmatic proposals. The General Assembly elects the Executive Board for the proposed projects, selects the scientific programs of the Union, reviews the progress of scientific programs, collaborates with other international organizations and decides on the allocation of funding. The General Assembly takes place in parallel to a scientific conference, organized in cooperation with the National Union Committee of the host country.

== Programmes ==
The scientific programmes of the General Assembly are approved in accordance with the Statutes of the Union. Where necessary and possible, the EU has granted start-up funding for individual programs, that supports the further funding from national or international donors or by negotiated agreements with the Union.

=== Examples of programmes ===
Diversitas, Human Dimensions of Biodiversity, Climate Change Integrative Biology (ICCB), Systematics Agenda, Biological Education (BioED), IUBS Bioethics Ethics Committee earlier, Bionomenclature, Biology and Traditional Knowledge, Biological Consequences of Global Change (BCGC) Darwin200, Biosystematics, Species 2000, Genomics and Evolution, Modernizing the codes to meet future needs of scientific communities (Biocode), Biology Research and Education Resources in Africa, Reproductive Biology, Aquaculture, Bio-Energy and Towards an Integrative Biology (TAIB).

== Publications ==
The institution publishes four times a year ''Biology International'' and other publications such as ''IUBS Monograph Series'', ''Methodology Manual Series'' and the ''Proceedings of the IUBS General Assemblies''.

== Legal status and finance ==
The International Union of Biological Sciences is non-profit and does not pursue economic goals. It is funded from the following sources:
* annual dues of full members;
* assistance received from UNESCO and other international organizations that support the scientific programs of the Union;
* other sources

The activities of the Union are within an annual budget of about 340,000, - € (2006). Of these, the salaries of a director and a secretary are paid, who run the Union's office in Paris. All other offices (President, Secretary General, Treasurer, etc.) are honorary offices for which only the direct expenses will be paid for.

== History ==
The Union was founded in 1919 following the work of the ''Conference of Allied Academies of Sciences'' held in Brussels. Originally the 'S' was not for science but for Societies. 
After defining its constitution and organization in 1925, the IUBS adheres to the International Research Council (International Council for Science), which is now known by the acronym ICSU (International Council of Scientific Unions).
From 1925 to 1939, the IUBS worked on two main themes: information science and the environment. This second project resulted in the creation of the ''World Conservation Union'' or IUCN.
After being dormant for 1935 to 1949, the IUCB{{clarify|reason=Is that a typo for IUCN? Or what?|date=May 2013}} developed a highly original program of international research:
* In the eighties, it developed a number of scientific programs, such as the Decade of the Tropics, bioindicators, biological complexity and biodiversity.
* Since the 2000s the organization has been working on various projects: Diversity, Biosystematics, Species 2000 and Bionomenclature.

'''Karl-Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jacob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester Buhl-Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg''' (born 5 December 1971) is a [[Germans|German]] businessman and politician of the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|Christian Social Union]]  (CSU). He served as a member of the [[Bundestag]] from 2002 to 2011, as Secretary-General of the CSU from 2008 to 2009, as [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Germany)|Federal Minister for Economics and Technology]] in 2009 and as [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Federal Minister of Defence]] from 2009 to 2011. 

After the discovery of plagiarism in his doctoral dissertation and the decision of the [[University of Bayreuth]] to revoke his doctorate, an affair known as [[Guttenberg plagiarism scandal]], he resigned from all political posts in March 2011.

In 2011, Guttenberg joined the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] (CSIS). Guttenberg is the chairman and a founder of ''Spitzberg Partners'', an advisory and investment firm based in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-133575505.html|title=Dr. Dotcom|language=German|publisher=Der Spiegel|date=2015-04-11|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.br.de/nachrichten/guttenberg-usa-new-york-100.html|title=Das neue Leben des KT|language=German|publisher=Bayerischer Rundfunk|date=2015-05-27|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to German politics during the [[German federal election, 2017|2017 federal election]] by making a speech which was widely described as a comeback.&lt;ref name="Reuters2017" /&gt;

=== Member of Parliament ===
In [[German federal election, 2002|2002]], Guttenberg was elected to the [[Bundestag]] as the representative of [[Kulmbach (electoral district)|Kulmbach]]. He was reelected in [[German federal election, 2005|2005]], winning 60.0% of the votes in his constituency. In [[German federal election, 2009|2009]], he was reelected again with 68.1% of the votes in his district, obtaining the highest percentage of votes of all elected representatives in Germany for that election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.derwesten.de/nachrichten/politik/bundestagswahl/Guttenberg-erzielt-bundesweit-bestes-Wahlergebnis-id30254.html |title=Guttenberg erzielt bundesweit bestes Wahlergebnis|language=German| publisher=DerWesten.de |date=2009-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Political positions ====
In early 2004, Guttenberg introduced the concept of a [[Privileged partnership|Privileged Partnership]] between [[Turkey]] and the [[European Union]] as a viable alternative to [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]] into the German political discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article283505/Privilegierte_Partnerschaft.html|title=Privilegierte Partnerschaft|language=German|publisher=Welt Online|date=2004-01-03|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/15/opinion/15iht-edgutten_ed3_.html|title=Preserving Europe : Offer Turkey a 'privileged partnership' instead|publisher=The New York Times|date=2004-12-15|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guttenberg based his opposition to full Turkish membership in the EU on the country's insufficient fulfillment of relevant accession criteria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article1047472/Union_bleibt_der_Tuerkei_gegenueber_kritisch.html|title=Union bleibt der Türkei gegenüber kritisch|language=German|publisher=Welt Online|date=2007-07-23|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example with regard to the [[Cyprus dispute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiwo.de/politik-weltwirtschaft/union-setzt-tuerkei-weiter-unter-druck-111573/|title=Union setzt Türkei weiter unter Druck|language=German|publisher=WirtschaftsWoche|date=2005-09-01|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he stressed the necessity of maintaining good relations with Turkey and was therefore critical of a [[France|French]] initiative to criminalize the denial of the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,442515,00.html|title=CSU-Politiker kritisieren Frankreichs Anti-Türkei-Politik|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2006-10-13|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guttenberg also repeatedly warned of the looming threat posed to German and European security by [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article802737/Unionspolitiker_fuerchten_den_Iran.html|title=Unionspolitiker fürchten den Iran|language=German|publisher=Welt Online|date=2007-04-10|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he rejected taking rash military action against [[Iran]] and instead called for an international diplomatic effort to deal with Tehran's nuclear program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,516113,00.html|title= Iran Crisis To Top Agenda of US Trip|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2007-11-08|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//RTV/2010/02/08/RTV320310/|title= GERMANY: Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg denounces Iran's latest announcement that it will start to enrich fuel|publisher=ITN Source|date=2010-02-08|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a Member of Parliament, he was a strong critic of the far-left party [[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]], which he accused of links to [[terrorists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article2279846/Warum-Lafontaines-Linkspartei-gefaehrlich-ist.html |title=Warum Lafontaines Linkspartei gefährlich ist|language=German|publisher=Welt Online |date=2008-08-07 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Secretary General of the CSU ====
In September 2008, the CSU suffered heavy losses in the [[Bavaria state election, 2008|Bavaria state election]] and lost its absolute majority in the [[Landtag of Bavaria|Bavarian Landtag]] - for the first time in 46 years. As a result of this political defeat the CSU party leadership stepped down&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/09/30/uk-germany-csu-idUKTRE48T1TH20080930|title=Bavaria's CSU leader quits after election blow|publisher=Reuters|date=2008-09-30|accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/10/01/uk-germany-csu-idUKTRE4903TQ20081001|title=Second CSU leader quits, raising risks for Merkel|publisher=Reuters|date=2008-10-01|accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Horst Seehofer]], the new CSU chairman and [[minister-president]] of Bavaria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aCOKp59WbZE8&amp;refer=germany|title=Germany's Seehofer, Merkel Ally, Elected Bavarian State Premier|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2008-10-27|accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; appointed Guttenberg as [[secretary general]] of the CSU in November 2008.&lt;ref name="Generalsekretär"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,587382,00.html|title=Guttenberg wird Seehofers Generalsekretär|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2008-10-30|accessdate=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/world/europe/30iht-bavaria.4.17389046.html|title=Merkel's Bavarian allies go for a younger look|publisher=The New York Times|date=2008-10-30|accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guttenberg, the youngest economics minister in the German post-war era,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/02/09/uk-germany-guttenberg-profile-sb-idUKTRE5183WY20090209|title=FACTBOX - Germany's new Economy Minister Guttenberg|publisher=Reuters|date=2009-02-09|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to office in the midst of a deep global [[Late-2000s financial crisis|financial crisis]] and [[Late-2000s recession|recession]].

In the wake of the global financial crisis, several major German banks were near failure, including [[Hypo Real Estate]], which received €102 billion of credit and guarantees from Germany's bank rescue fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/02/11/hyporealestate-guarantees-idUSLB10301220090211|title=Troubled Hypo takes more help from German govt|publisher=Reuters|date=2009-02-11|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, Guttenberg opposed an overly hasty nationalization of Hypo Real Estate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/hypo-real-estate-csu-sperrt-sich-gegen-enteignung-654818.html|title=CSU sperrt sich gegen Enteignung|language=German|publisher=stern.de|date=2009-02-15|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he considered only as "''ultissima ratio'', a measure of the very last resort".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=alkNlCqLUl6s&amp;refer=germany|title=Merkel Backs Hypo Majority Stake Over Nationalization|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2009-02-16|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later he drafted a legislative proposal to minimize the financial risks of failing banks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a.4adR2FxhRw|title=Germany’s Guttenberg Draws Up Bill to Prop Up Insolvent Banks|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2009-08-06|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/germany-prepares-new-rescue-methods-for-banks/|title=Germany Prepares New Rescue Methods for Banks|publisher=The New York Times|date=2009-08-06|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which caused controversy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/0,1518,645090,00.html|title=SPD legt eigenes Gesetz zur Bankenrettung vor|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2009-08-26|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later became the foundation of the German bank restructuring bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2010/08/25/germany-banks-idUKLDE67O0Q620100825|title=German cabinet backs bank restructuring bill|publisher=Reuters|date=2010-08-25|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2010-08/bankenabgabe-kabinett|title=Regierung zwingt Banken zur Vorsorge|language=German|publisher=Zeit Online|date=2010-08-25|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of troubled German companies asking for state aid, including automaker [[Opel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dradio.de/aktuell/923694/|title=Guttenberg verlangt Zukunftskonzept von Opel|language=German|publisher=Deutschlandradio|date=2009-02-23|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now-defunct mail-order service [[Arcandor|Arcandor/Quelle]],&lt;ref name="Arcandor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2009/06/03/afx6498316.html|title=Arcandor does not meet state aid criteria-EconMin|publisher=Forbes|date=2009-03-06|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guttenberg was reluctant to commit government resources.

The [[German federal election, 2009|2009 Bundestag elections]] led to a change in government, as the incumbent [[grand coalition]] of  [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] was replaced by a center-right coalition of CDU/CSU and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/27/AR2009092700631.html|title=Germany's Merkel Reelected, Will Form New Coalition|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2009-09-28|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to German press reports, Chancellor Merkel offered Guttenberg the choice between the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|interior]] and the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|defence]] ministries while negotiating the distribution of ministerial posts within the new coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idDEBEE59M04R20091023|title=Kreise-Merkel stellt Guttenberg Innen oder Verteidigung zur Wahl|language=German|publisher=Reuters Deutschland|date=2009-10-23|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ka-news.de/region/karlsruhe/Umfrage-Welches-Ministerium-fuer-zu-Guttenberg-;art6066,290569 |title=Umfrage: Welches Ministerium für zu Guttenberg? |publisher=Ka-news.de |date=2009-10-24 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guttenberg decided to opt for the defence portfolio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aBflR09Zv9ag|title=Guttenberg to Move From Economy to Defense Minister, DPA Says |publisher=Bloomberg|date=2009-10-23|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/world/europe/25merkel.html|title=Merkel Picks Team to Govern in Germany|publisher=The New York Times|date=2009-10-24|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took the oath of office on 28 October 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.az-web.de/sixcms/detail.php?template=az_detail&amp;id=1098640&amp;_wo=News:Topnews&amp;_g=Gerade-im-Amt,-schon-beim-Zapfenstreich|title=Gerade im Amt, schon beim Zapfenstreich |language=German|publisher=[[Aachener Zeitung]]|date=2009-10-30|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Second Cabinet Merkel]].

==== Afghanistan ====
The first political challenge facing defence minister Guttenberg was dealing with the [[2009 Kunduz airstrike|Kunduz airstrike]] of 4 September 2009. Initially, he adopted the position of his predecessor [[Franz Josef Jung|Jung]] and defended the air strike as "militarily appropriate". However, in contrast to Jung, Guttenberg conceded that the strike had also caused civilian casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/artikel/S31325/luftangriff-bei-kundus-guttenberg-militaerisch-angemessen-30077256.html|title=Guttenberg: "Militärisch angemessen"|language=German|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|date=2009-11-06|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Guttenberg had received additional information and investigative reports dating back to the tenure of his predecessor Jung, Guttenberg changed his position concerning the "Kunduz airstrike"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/s/Rub0CCA23BC3D3C4C78914F85BED3B53F3C/Doc~EE8E18848093F488F85966D5BEF6DC8B7~ATpl~Ecommon~Sspezial.html|title=Guttenberg: "Militärisch nicht angemessen"|language=German|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|date=2009-12-03|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dismissed [[Bundeswehr]] [[Chief of Staff]] [[Wolfgang Schneiderhan (general)|Schneiderhahn]] and Parliamentary State Secretary of Defence Wichert on 26 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/27/world/europe/27germany.html|title=German General Quits Over Airstrike|publisher=The New York Times|date=2009-11-26|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung, who in the meantime had assumed the position of [[Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (Germany)|labor minister]] in the second Merkel cabinet, took full political responsibility for the delay in sharing relevant Kunduz air strike information and resigned the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aqOtGzROkKek|title=German Minister Jung Quits on Afghan Air Strike|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2009-11-27|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the demand of the opposition parties, the Bundestag subsequently established a special investigative committee to shed light on the defense ministry's communications policy in connection with the Kunduz air strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/12/03/germany-afghanistan-idINGEE5B22HE20091203|title=German parliament backs extension of Afghan mission|publisher=Reuters|date=2009-12-03|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="invcom"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/world/europe/16iht-germany.html|title=Pressure Builds on Merkel and Defense Minister Over NATO Bombing|publisher=The New York Times|date=2009-12-15|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The final report of the Bundestag's special investigative committee cleared Guttenberg from the accusation that he had been responsible for the defence ministry's inadequate communications policy following the Kunduz strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,771983,00.html|title=Koalition entlastet Guttenberg|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2011-07-02|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/verteidigung-urteil-zur-kundus-affaere-guttenberg-unschuldig_aid_642309.html|title=Urteil zur Kundus-Affäre: Guttenberg unschuldig|language=German|publisher=Focus Online|date=2011-07-02 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings were supported by members from the ruling CDU/CSU-FDP coalition while the opposition parties criticized the special investigative committee's report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/koalitions-bericht-zur-kundus-affaere-persilschein-fuer-guttenberg-1.1115279|title=Persilschein für Guttenberg|language=German|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|date=2011-07-02|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later published their own account of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15311961,00.html|title=German opposition condemns Kunduz airstrike as mistake|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=2011-08-11|accessdate=2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/kundus-untersuchungsausschuss-politisch-nicht-angemessen-1715798.html|title=Politisch nicht angemessen|language=German|publisher=stern.de|date=2011-08-11|accessdate=2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after taking office, Guttenberg publicly compared the situation faced by Bundeswehr soldiers in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] to "war".&lt;ref name="Afg" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n24.de/news/newsitem_5565566.html|title=Guttenberg: Afghanistan-Einsatz ist für Soldaten Krieg|language=German|publisher=N24|date=2009-11-03|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idDEBEE5A20IC20091103 |title=Guttenberg spricht von Krieg in Afghanistan|language=German|publisher=Reuters Deutschland|date=2009-11-03|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.de/national/20100404-26311.html It's war, says Guttenberg], ''[[The Local]]'', 4 Apr 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, Guttenberg broke a major political taboo since up until then Germany's political leadership – including the Chancellor and previous defense ministers – had only referred to the Afghanistan intervention as a "stabilization deployment".&lt;ref name="invcom" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/28/world/europe/28germany.html|title=German Minister Resigns Over Afghan Airstrike|publisher=The New York Times|date=2009-11-27|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15954464|title=What is this thing called war?|publisher=The Economist|date=2010-04-22|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new classification of the Bundeswehr's Afghanistan deployment as "war" improved the legal status of German soldiers operating under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1978800,00.html|title=Germany Comes to Terms With Its New War|publisher=TIME World|date=2010-04-09|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Guttenberg in Kunduz Province in December 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Guttenberg in [[Kunduz Province]] in December 2009]]

Guttenberg attempted to elevate public perception of Germany's Afghan mission by personally participating - sometimes along with the Chancellor - at funeral services held for fallen Bundeswehr soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/04/24/merkel-mourns-german-troops-killed-in-afghanistan|title=Merkel mourns German troops killed in Afghanistan|publisher=euronews|date=2010-04-24|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/ausland/konflikte-report-politiker-verneigen-sich-vor-toten-soldaten_aid_501725.html|title=Report: Politiker verneigen sich vor toten Soldaten|language=German|publisher=Focus Online|date=2010-04-24|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, Guttenberg established the [[Combat Action Medal of the Bundeswehr]], which is awarded for bravery in combat and to soldiers who were the targets of terrorist or military attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,728961,00.html|title=Guttenberg führt Kämpfer-Orden ein|language=German|publisher=Der Spiegel|date=2010-11-13|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2010-11/bundeswehr-orden-gefecht|title=Tapferkeit im Gefecht wird zur soldatischen Tugend|language=German|publisher=Zeit Online|date=2010-11-30|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.life.com/image/107193797|title=Bundeswehr Soldiers Receive Combat Medal|publisher=LIFE|date=2010-11-29|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the political level, Guttenberg spoke out strongly against a military withdrawal from Afghanistan. He specifically warned against imposing fixed troop withdrawal timetables that do not take into account the security situation on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle08.asp?xfile=data/international/2010/February/international_February518.xml&amp;section=international|title=No concrete withdrawal date from Afghanistan|publisher=Khaleej Times Online|date=2010-02-10|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/world/europe/29germany.html|title=Germany Plans Start of Troop Withdrawal|publisher=The New York Times|date=2011-01-28|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Guttenberg also demanded a stronger involvement of key neighboring states such as Russia, India, and China in the resolution of the Afghan conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n-tv.de/politik/Guttenberg-will-NATO-Reform-article715950.html|title=Guttenberg will NATO-Reform|language=German|publisher=n-tv|date=2010-02-07|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/KL04Df03.html|title=Iran left out in the cold|publisher=Asia Times|date=2009-12-04|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In light of the traditionally challenging security situation in Afghanistan, Guttenberg called for the development of an internationally coordinated long-term security strategy – based on the use of special forces and close intelligence cooperation within the coalition – to stabilize the country even after the eventual withdrawal of all foreign troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/national/20100705-28297.html|title=Tough summer ahead in Afghanistan, minister warns|publisher=The Local|date=2010-07-05|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure as defense minister, Guttenberg made nine visits to Afghanistan and the German soldiers deployed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a9aj2wycyOT0|title=Germany’s Guttenberg Visits Afghanistan, Meets Troops, Karzai|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2009-11-12|accessdate=2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a_kK8MBTbFOs|title=Germany’s Guttenberg Visits Afghanistan Amid Airstrike Fallout|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2009-12-11|accessdate=2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; To gain a first-hand understanding of the situation on the ground and the military risks of the Bundeswehr's mission, Guttenberg went several times to the frontlines of the Afghan conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,714459,00.html|title=Guttenberg in der Gefechtszone|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2010-08-29|accessdate=2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article10735902/Guttenberg-trifft-seine-Soldaten-an-der-Front.html|title=Guttenberg trifft seine Soldaten an der Front|language=German|publisher=Welt Online|date=2010-11-04|accessdate=2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also invited journalists to accompany him on these trips in an effort to educate the wider German public about the nature of the Bundeswehr deployment in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.n-tv.de/mediathek/videos/politik/Guttenberg-besucht-Kampfgebiet-article1375241.html|medium = Television production|title=Guttenberg besucht Kampfgebiet|publisher=n-tv|language=German|date=2010-08-30|accessdate=2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, Guttenberg traveled to Afghanistan along with his wife Stephanie to visit with the troops before the Christmas holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/12/13/german-minister-takes-wife-to-afghanistan/|title=German minister takes wife to Afghanistan|publisher=euronews|date=2010-12-13|accessdate=2011-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he was also accompanied by German TV moderator [[Johannes B.

In early 2010, Guttenberg decided to push for fundamental Bundeswehr reforms in an effort to address the structural deficits within the German armed forces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,687458,00.html|title=Billig-Training vor dem tödlichen Einsatz|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2010-04-06|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/jahresbericht-zur-bundeswehr-mangel-und-missstand-an-allen-fronten-1551308.html|title=Mangel und Missstand an allen Fronten|language=German|publisher=stern.de|date=2010-03-16|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to deal with declining defense budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/artikel/C30923/verteidigungsetat-guttenbergs-opferbereitschaft-30074342.html|title=Guttenbergs Opferbereitschaft|language=German|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|date=2010-06-02|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall goal was to boost the Bundeswehr's expeditionary capabilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2011587827_apeugermanymilitaryreform.html|title=German military could send more troops abroad|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=2010-04-12|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; while, at the same time, achieving cost reductions.

=== Plagiarism scandal and resignation ===
{{Main|Guttenberg plagiarism scandal}}
In 2011, Guttenberg resigned amid controversy over his dissertation. The first accusations of [[plagiarism]] in Guttenberg's dissertation were made public in February 2011. Guttenberg's doctoral dissertation, "Verfassung und Verfassungsvertrag" ("Constitution and Constitutional Treaty"), had been the basis of his 2007 Doctorate from the [[University of Bayreuth]].&lt;ref name="sz_doktorarbeit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/guttenbergs-doktorarbeit-summa-cum-laude-mehr-als-schmeichelhaft-1.1060779 |title=Summa cum laude? – "Mehr als schmeichelhaft"|author=Roland Preuß|work=sueddeutsche.de |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sz_plagiatsvorwurf"&gt;{{cite news|author=Roland Preuß and Tanjev Schultz |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/plagiatsvorwurf-gegen-verteidigungsminister-guttenberg-soll-bei-doktorarbeit-abgeschrieben-haben-1.1060774 |title=Plagiatsvorwurf gegen Verteidigungsminister: zu Guttenberg soll bei Doktorarbeit abgeschrieben haben|work=sueddeutsche.de |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guttenberg at first denied intentional plagiarism, calling the accusations "absurd," but acknowledged that he may have made errors in his footnotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,745919,00.html |title=Fußnoten-Streit: Dr. Guttenberg nennt Plagiatsvorwürfe abstrus|work=Spiegel Online |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-minister-denies"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-12489762 |title=German minister denies plagiarism on PhD thesis |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-resignation"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/01/german-defence-minister-resigns-plagiarism |title=German defence minister resigns in PhD plagiarism row |author=Helen Pidd |publisher=The Guardian |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it emerged that Guttenberg had requested a report from the Bundestag's research department, which he had then inserted into his thesis without attribution.&lt;ref name="spiegel-accusations-widen"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/plagiarism-accusations-widen-guttenberg-copied-work-of-german-parliament-s-research-department-a-746573.html |title=Plagiarism Accusations Widen: Guttenberg Copied Work of German Parliament's Research Department |publisher=Spiegel Online |date=2011-02-19 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February 2011, Guttenberg apologized in [[Bundestag (Germany)|parliament]] for flaws in his thesis, but denied intentional deception and denied the use of a ghostwriter.&lt;ref name="reuters-admits-mistakes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-minister-plagiarism-idUKTRE71M4JY20110223 |title=German minister admits mistakes in plagiarism row |author=Erik Kirschbaum |publisher=Reuters |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 February 2011, the University of Bayreuth withdrew Guttenberg's doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,747358,00.html|title=Uni Bayreuth entzieht Guttenberg den Doktortitel|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2011-02-23|accessdate=2012-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-defense-minister-loses-doctorate-amid-plagiarism-scandal/a-14860585 |title=German defense minister loses doctorate amid plagiarism scandal |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part due to the expressions of confidence by Angela Merkel, the scandal continued to evoke heavy criticism from prominent academics, legal scholars (who accused Guttenberg of intentional plagiarism), and politicians both in the opposition and in the governing coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rudolf Neumaier |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/plagiatsaffaere-um-guttenberg-wir-sind-einem-betrueger-aufgesessen-1.1065263 |title=Plagiatsaffäre um Guttenberg "Einem Betrüger aufgesessen"|work=sueddeutsche.de |date=2011-02-26 |accessdate=2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/plagiatsaffaere-juristen-unterstellen-guttenberg-vorsatz/3886578.html |title=Plagiatsaffäre: Juristen unterstellen Guttenberg Vorsatz |publisher=Handelsblatt |date=2011-02-26 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel-resignation"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/plagiarism-affair-defense-minister-guttenberg-resigns-a-748330.html |title=Plagiarism Affair: Defense Minister Guttenberg Resigns |publisher=Spiegel Online |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 2011, Guttenberg announced his resignation as Minister of Defense, from his seat in the Bundestag, and from all other political offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-guttenberg-idUSTRE7201WI20110301 |title=German defense minister quits in plagiarism row |author=Erik Kirschbaum |publisher=Reuters |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, a University of Bayreuth commission tasked with investigating Guttenberg's dissertation came to the conclusion that Guttenberg had engaged in intentional deception in the writing of his dissertation, and had violated standards of good academic practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/lebenundlernen/uni/abschlussbericht-in-bayreuth-guttenberg-gibt-familie-mitschuld-an-doktorschmu-a-761868.html |title=Abschlussbericht in Bayreuth: Guttenberg gibt Familie Mitschuld an Doktorschmu |publisher=Spiegel Online |date=2011-05-11 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dw.com/en/university-says-ex-defense-minister-deliberately-cheated-on-thesis/a-15056863 |title=University says ex-defense minister 'deliberately cheated' on thesis |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=2011-05-06 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission found that he had included borrowed passages throughout his thesis, without citation, and had modified those passages in order to conceal their origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article13365134/Uni-Bayreuth-weist-Guttenbergs-Beteuerungen-zurueck.html |title=Uni Bayreuth weist Guttenbergs Beteuerungen zurück |publisher=Die Welt |date=2011-05-11 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.badische-zeitung.de/deutschland-1/uni-bayreuth-guttenberg-hat-vorsaetzlich-getaeuscht--45177077.html |title=Uni Bayreuth: Guttenberg hat vorsätzlich getäuscht |publisher=Badische Zeitung |date=2011-05-12 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the prosecution in [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]] discontinued the criminal proceedings for copyright violations against Guttenberg on condition of Guttenberg paying €20,000 to a charity. The prosecutor found 23 prosecutable copyright violations in Guttenberg's dissertation, but estimated that the material damage suffered by the authors of those texts was marginal.&lt;ref name="sz-eingestellt"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/karriere/ermittlungen-in-plagiatsaffaere-eingestellt-guttenberg-kommt-glimpflich-davon-1.1197275 |title=Guttenberg kommt glimpflich davon |publisher=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |date=2011-11-23 |accessdate=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo-ap-dropped"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/prosecutors-drop-case-against-german-ex-minister-113344146.html |title=Prosecutors drop case against German ex-minister |publisher=[[Yahoo!

The doctorate affair also led to scrutiny of other politicians' doctorates, notably that of his colleague in the federal cabinet [[Annette Schavan]] and Hungarian President [[Pál Schmitt]], who lost their doctorates for similar reasons.

== Post-resignation career ==
In September 2011, Guttenberg joined the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-based [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] (CSIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/news/2011-09/29/politik-guttenberg-schliesst-sich-us-thinktank-an-29170607|title= Guttenberg schließt sich US-Thinktank an|language=German|publisher=Zeit Online|date=2011-09-29|accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Halifax International Security Forum]] in November 2011, Guttenberg made his first public appearance since joining CSIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20111120-38983.html|title=Guttenberg attacks former colleagues|publisher=The Local|date=2011-11-20|accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a plenary session on the economic and financial crisis he voiced pessimism about the current state of the EU&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article13725817/Guttenbergs-grosser-Pessimismus-in-der-Euro-Krise.html|title=Guttenbergs großer Pessimismus in der Euro-Krise|language=German|publisher=Welt Online|date=2011-11-20|accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and decried a severe "crisis of political leadership".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abendblatt.de/politik/deutschland/article2100075/Guttenberg-prangert-Fuehrungskrise-an.html|title=Guttenberg prangert Führungskrise an|language=German|publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt|date=2011-11-21|accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Guttenberg published the book ''"Vorerst gescheitert"'' ("Failed for Now"). The publication is based on a series of conversations with the [[editor-in-chief]] of [[Die Zeit]], [[Giovanni di Lorenzo]], in which Guttenberg talks extensively for the first time about his political career, the [[Causa Guttenberg|plagiarism scandal]] and his resignation, as well as his plans for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/24/idINIndia-60716820111124|title=Fallen German conservative star ready for comeback|publisher=Reuters|date=2011-11-24|accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guttenberg's criticism in the book of the direction which the CSU is headed sparked some controversy within his party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/karriere/guttenberg-buch-ueber-plagiatsaffaere-ich-bin-kein-blender-und-betrueger-1.1221178| title=Ich bin kein Blender und Betrüger|language=German|publisher=Sueddeutsche Zeitung Online|date=2011-11-29|accessdate= 2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,801542,00.html|title=Nicht nötig, uns eine mitzugeben|language=German|publisher=SPIEGEL Online|date=2011-12-03|accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guttenberg is a strong critic of [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]]'s expansionist foreign policy. In Spring 2014, he decried an "astonishing leadership vacuum in the world" and demanded that the West, and especially Europe, respond to Moscow's aggressions with strong political action. He praised Chancellor Merkel for her firm stance against Putin. Guttenberg appeared together with [[Henry Kissinger]] during a CNN interview about the [[2013–15 Ukrainian crisis|Ukraine crisis]] and explained the significant domestic political resistance that Merkel's Russia policy faced in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2014/05/11/kissinger-on-russias-global-integration/|title=Kissinger on Russia's global integration|publisher=CNN|date=2014-05-11|accessdate=2015-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later Guttenberg accused the EU of inaction and a lack of capabilities given the crises in [[Ukraine]] and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/karl-theodor-zu-guttenberg-the-return-of-europes-sleepwalkers-1409786698|title=The Return of Europe's Sleepwalkers|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=2014-09-03|accessdate=2015-02-12|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 2014, Guttenberg formed Spitzberg Partners LLC, a consulting and  investment company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capital.de/meinungen/putins-strategie-durchkreuzen.html|title=Putins Stragie durchkreuzen|language=German|publisher=Capital|date=2014-03-11|accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, Spitzberg Partners  and Canadian Acasta Capital&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/finanzen/diverses/aussenhandel-neue-beratungspartnerschaft-unterstuetzt-europaeische-und-kanadische-unternehmen-beim-ausbau-ihrer-wirtschaftsbeziehungen_id_4156970.html|title=Außenhandel: Neue Beratungspartnerschaft unterstützt europäische und kanadische Unternehmen beim Ausbau ihrer Wirtschaftsbeziehungen|language=German|publisher=Spitzberg Partners|date=2014-09-24|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  founded ''Atlantic Advisory Partners'' (AAP), a partnership to promote business and trade between [[Canada]] and the [[European Union]] in connection with the [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement]] (CETA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiwo.de/politik/europa/karl-theodor-zu-guttenberg-ex-minister-soll-das-eu-handelsabkommen-ceta-retten/11773300.html|title=Ex-Minister soll das EU-Handelsabkommen CETA retten|language=German|publisher=WirtschaftsWoche|date=2015-05-15|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a part of diplomatic outreach, Guttenberg and [[Karin Olofsdotter (diplomat)|Karin Olofsdotter]] were part of a town hall style meeting in Peters Township, south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="The Swedish ambassador’s search for answers in Trump country"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-swedish-ambassadors-searches-for-answers-in-trump-country/2017/11/05/6aab69be-bfe1-11e7-8444-a0d4f04b89eb_story.html | title=The Swedish ambassador’s search for answers in Trump country | publisher=Washington Post | date=5 November 2017 | accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political comeback==
Guttenberg returned to German politics by making a speech during the [[German federal election, 2017]] in which he hailed Chancellor Angela Merkel. The speech was widely reported on in German media and described as marking his comeback in German politics. Guttenberg also said Germany should preserve its relationship with the United States in order to renew the ties after the end of the Trump era, noting that "they won’t forget it if, at a time when they were being mocked by the whole world, we maintained contacts with them and said this relationship is important now and will remain so in future."&lt;ref name="Reuters2017"&gt;[https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-election-guttenberg/ovation-for-merkel-ally-guttenberg-on-his-political-come-back-idUKKCN1BA2MI Ovation for Merkel ally Guttenberg on his political come-back], Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl Johann Bernhard Karsten''' (26 November 1782 &amp;ndash; 22 August 1853) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mineralogist]] known for contributions made to the German [[metallurgy]] industry.

==Biography==
He was born at [[Bützow]] in [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] and initially studied law in [[University of Rostock|Rostock]]. From 1801 he devoted his time to mining and metallurgy. In 1819 he was named mining councilor to the Ministry of the Interior in [[Berlin]]. He was a major factor in the emergence of the [[zinc]] industry in [[Silesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mQNJAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Karsten,+Karl+Johann+Bernhard%22+1782&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v2FxNEOdRw&amp;sig=Mc4_6qw1f6k4MTc_rZEymjj6azU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJyKGE_9vJAhWSoIMKHZy0AK0Q6AEITTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Karsten%2C%20Karl%20Johann%20Bernhard%22%201782&amp;f=false The New International Encyclopedia, Volume 13]  edited by Frank Moore Colby, Talcott Williams&lt;/ref&gt;

He was author of several comprehensive works, including:
* ''Handbuch der Eisenhüttenkunde'' (2 volumes, 1816; 3rd edition, 1841).
* ''System der Metallurgie, geschichtlich, statistisch, theoretisch und technisch'' (5 volumes, with atlas, 1831-1832).
* ''Lehrbuch der Salinenkunde'' (2 volumes, 1846-1847). 

He was well known as editor of the ''Archiv für Bergbau und Hüttenwesen'' (Archive for mining and metallurgy; 20 volumes, 1818-1831); and (with [[Ernst Heinrich Karl von Dechen]]) of the ''Archiv für Mineralogie, Geognosie, Bergbau und Hüttenkunde'' (26 volumes, 1829-1854).&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Karsten,_Karl_Johann_Bernhard ADB:Karsten, Karl Johann Bernhard] [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at [[Berlin]] in 1853. His son, Dr. [[Hermann Karsten (physicist)|Hermann Karsten]] (1809-1877), was a professor of [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] at the [[University of Rostock]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8928">At the 1912 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], [[Edmund Landau]] listed four basic problems about [[prime number]]s. These problems were characterised in his speech as "unattackable at the present state of mathematics" and are now known as '''Landau's problems'''. They are as follows:
# [[Goldbach's conjecture]]: Can every even integer greater than 2 be written as the sum of two primes?
# [[Twin prime conjecture]]: Are there infinitely many primes ''p'' such that ''p'' + 2 is prime?
# [[Legendre's conjecture]]: Does there always exist at least one prime between consecutive [[Square number|perfect squares]]?
# Are there infinitely many primes ''p'' such that ''p'' − 1 is a perfect square? In other words: Are there infinitely many primes of the form ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1?

{{As of|2018}}, all four problems are unresolved.

==Progress toward solutions==

===Goldbach's conjecture===
[[Vinogradov's theorem]] proves [[Goldbach's weak conjecture]] for sufficiently large ''n''.  In 2013 [[Harald Helfgott]] proved the weak conjecture for all odd numbers greater than 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1305.2897 |title = Major arcs for Goldbach's theorem|last = Helfgott|first = H.A. |class=math.NT |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1205.5252 |title = Minor arcs for Goldbach's problem |last = Helfgott|first = H.A.|class=math.NT |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1312.7748 |title = The ternary Goldbach conjecture is true|last = Helfgott|first = H.A. |class=math.NT |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Goldbach's conjecture]], Goldbach's weak conjecture states that every odd number greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three primes. Although Goldbach's strong conjecture has not been proven or disproven, its proof would imply the proof of Goldbach's weak conjecture.

[[Chen's theorem]] proves that for all sufficiently large ''n'', &lt;math&gt;2n=p+q&lt;/math&gt; where ''p'' is prime and ''q'' is either prime or [[semiprime]]. [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Montgomery]] and [[Robert Charles Vaughan (mathematician)|Vaughan]] showed that the exceptional set (even numbers not expressible as the sum of two primes) was of [[Natural density|density]] zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. L. |last=Montgomery |last2=Vaughan |first2=R. C. |url=http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/aa/aa27/aa27126.pdf |title=The exceptional set in Goldbach's problem |journal=Acta Arithmetica |volume=27 |issue= |year=1975 |pages=353–370 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Tomohiro Yamada proved an explicit version of Chen's theorem:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Yamada |first=Tomohiro |eprint=1511.03409 |title=Explicit Chen's theorem |class=math.NT |date=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; every even number greater than &lt;math&gt;e^{e^{36}} \approx 1.7\cdot10^{1872344071119348}&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of a prime and a product of at most two primes.

===Twin prime conjecture===
[[Yitang Zhang]]&lt;ref&gt;Yitang Zhang, [http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2014/179-3/p07 Bounded gaps between primes], ''Annals of Mathematics'' '''179''' (2014), pp. 1121–1174 from Volume 179 (2014), Issue 3&lt;/ref&gt; showed that there are infinitely many prime pairs with gap bounded by 70 million, and this result has been improved to gaps of length 246 by a collaborative effort of the [[Polymath Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=D.H.J. Polymath | title=Variants of the Selberg sieve, and bounded intervals containing many primes | journal=Research in the Mathematical Sciences | volume=1 | number=12 | doi=10.1186/s40687-014-0012-7 | arxiv=1407.4897 | year=2014 | mr=3373710 | page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the generalized [[Elliott–Halberstam conjecture]] this was improved to 6, extending earlier work by [[James Maynard (mathematician)|Maynard]]&lt;ref&gt;J. Maynard (2015), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.4600 Small gaps between primes]. ''Annals of Mathematics'' '''181'''(1): 383-413.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Daniel Goldston|Goldston]], [[János Pintz|Pintz]] &amp;amp; [[Cem Yıldırım|Yıldırım]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alan Goldston | first1 = Daniel | last2 = Motohashi | first2 = Yoichi | last3 = Pintz | first3 = János | last4 = Yalçın Yıldırım | first4 = Cem | year = 2006 | title = Small Gaps between Primes Exist | url = http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid.pja/1146576181 | journal = Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series A Mathematical Sciences | volume = 82 | issue = 4| pages = 61–65 | doi=10.3792/pjaa.82.61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chen Jingrun|Chen]] showed that there are infinitely many primes ''p'' (later called [[Chen prime]]s) such that ''p''+2 is either a prime or a semiprime.

===Legendre's conjecture===
It suffices to check that each prime gap starting at ''p'' is smaller than &lt;math&gt;2 \sqrt p&lt;/math&gt;. A table of maximal prime gaps shows that the conjecture holds to 4×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Kruse Andersen, [http://primerecords.dk/primegaps/maximal.htm Maximal Prime Gaps].&lt;/ref&gt; A counterexample near 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; would require a prime gap fifty million times the size of the average gap. Matomäki shows that there are at most &lt;math&gt;x^{1/6}&lt;/math&gt; exceptional primes followed by gaps larger than &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2p}&lt;/math&gt;; in particular,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\stackrel{p_{n+1}-p_n&gt;x^{1/2}}{x\le p_n\le 2x}}p_{n+1}-p_n\ll x^{2/3}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kaisa Matomäki|title=Large differences between consecutive primes|journal=Quarterly Journal of Mathematics|volume=58|year=2007|pages=489–518|doi=10.1093/qmath/ham021}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A result due to [[Albert Ingham|Ingham]] shows that there is a prime between &lt;math&gt;n^3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(n+1)^3&lt;/math&gt; for every large enough ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. E. |last=Ingham |title=On the difference between consecutive primes |journal=Quarterly Journal of Mathematics Oxford |volume=8 |year=1937 |issue=1 |pages=255–266 |doi=10.1093/qmath/os-8.1.255 |bibcode=1937QJMat...8..255I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near-square primes===
Landau's fourth problem asked whether there are infinitely many primes which are of the form &lt;math&gt;p=n^2+1&lt;/math&gt; for integer ''n''.  (The list of such primes is {{OEIS|id=A002496}}.)  The existence of infinitely many such primes would follow as a consequence of other number-theoretic conjectures such as the [[Bunyakovsky conjecture]] and [[Bateman–Horn conjecture]]. {{As of|2018}}, this problem is open. 

One example of near-square primes are [[Fermat primes]]. [[Henryk Iwaniec]] showed that there are infinitely many numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;n^2+1&lt;/math&gt; with at most two prime factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. |last=Iwaniec|title=Almost-primes represented by quadratic polynomials|journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] |volume=47 |issue=2 |year=1978|pages=178–188 |doi=10.1007/BF01578070 |bibcode=1978InMat..47..171I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robert J. Lemke Oliver|title=Almost-primes represented by quadratic polynomials|journal=Acta Arithmetica|volume=151|issue=3|year=2012|pages=241–261|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~rjlo/papers/04-Quadratic.pdf|doi=10.4064/aa151-3-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nesmith Ankeny]] proved that, assuming the [[extended Riemann hypothesis]] for [[L-function]]s on [[Hecke character]]s, there are infinitely many primes of the form &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;y=O(\log x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nesmith Ankeny|N. C. Ankeny]], Representations of primes by quadratic forms, Amer. J. Math. 74:4 (1952), pp. 913–919.&lt;/ref&gt; Landau's conjecture is for the stronger &lt;math&gt;y=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Deshouillers and Iwaniec,&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marc Deshouillers and Henryk Iwaniec, [https://eudml.org/doc/74560 On the greatest prime factor of &lt;math&gt;n^2+1&lt;/math&gt;], ''Annales de l'institut Fourier'' '''32''':4 (1982), pp. 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt; improving on Hooley&lt;ref&gt;C. Hooley, On the greatest prime factor of a quadratic polynomial, Acta Math., 117 ( 196 7), 281-299.&lt;/ref&gt; and Todd,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=J. Todd|title=A problem on arc tangent relations|journal=American Mathematical Monthly |volume=56 |issue=8 |year=1949 |pages=517–528 |doi=10.2307/2305526 |jstor=2305526}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that there are infinitely many numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;n^2+1&lt;/math&gt; with greatest prime factor at least &lt;math&gt;n^{1.2}&lt;/math&gt;. Replacing the exponent with 2 would yield Landau's conjecture.

The [[Brun sieve]] establishes an upper bound on the density of primes having the form &lt;math&gt;p=n^2+1&lt;/math&gt;: there are &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt x/\log x)&lt;/math&gt; such primes up to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. It then follows that [[almost all]] numbers of the form n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1 are composite.
&lt;!--
Banks, Friedlander, Pomerance, &amp; Shparlinski show that there are infinitely many squarefree ''n'' for which φ(''n'') is a square. Replacing "squarefree" with "prime" would yield the conjecture.

[[File:Lens Adapter.jpg|thumb|This lens adapter is a passive adapter designed for mounting a Nikon F-mount lens to a Micro Four Thirds camera.]]

In [[photography]] and [[videography]], a '''lens adapter''' is a device that enables the use of camera and lens combinations from otherwise incompatible systems. The most simple lens adapter designs, passive lens adapters provide a secure physical connection between the camera and the lens. Some passive adapters may include a mechanism for manual [[Diaphragm (optics)|iris]] control. So called, active lens adapters will include electronic connections, enabling communication between the lens and the camera.&lt;ref&gt;Plant, Ian. [http://www.popphoto.com/how-to/2013/02/lens-adapters-introductory-guide "Lens Adapters: An Introductory Guide"], 11 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some lens adapters include a special optical element called a [[telecompressor]], focal reducer, or more recently a "speed booster", a [[Generic trademark|genericised trademark]] that refers to the Metabones Speed Booster line of lens adapters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.uniquephoto.com/metabones-speedbooster-tele-compressor-speeds-up-mirrorless-cameras/ Metabones Speedbooster Tele-Compressor Speeds Up Mirrorless Cameras]&lt;/ref&gt; This type of adapter is designed to reduce [[focal length]], increase lens speed, and in some instances improve MTF performance. Another innovator in the field is KIPON, a German/Chinese co-operation between Kipon and IB/E Optics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adorama.com/g/kipon-main&lt;/ref&gt;

Another branch of lens adapters include an ND-filter to simplify changing lenses, which HolyManta introduced in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://holymanta.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[depth-of-field adapter]] (also called a DOF adapter or 35&amp;nbsp;mm adapter) is a largely obsolete device that uses a [[ground glass]] [[focusing screen]] to enable the use of [[interchangeable lens]]es on a fixed lens [[camcorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Philip. [http://philipbloom.net/other-stuff/faq/35mm-adaptors/ "35mm Adapters"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231095502/http://philipbloom.net/other-stuff/faq/35mm-adaptors/ |date=2014-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also lens adapters made for other optical systems, including [[microscope]]s and [[telescope]]s.

== Basic design ==
Most lens adapters feature a male fitting and a female fitting. The male fitting attaches to the camera, and the female fitting attaches to the lens. There is also an opening in the center to allow the light to pass through. Lens adapters can be shorter or longer, based on the respective [[flange focal distance]] of the lens and camera being adapted. Flange focal distance is the key specification in determining whether or not a particular type of lens can be adapted to any given camera. Generally speaking, cameras with a shorter flange focal distance can be adapted to a greater diversity of lenses. This is because there must be enough room to fit an adapter between the lens and the camera.

It is possible to physically mount a lens with a short flange focal distance on a camera with a long flange focal distance, but this will make it impossible to achieve [[infinity focus]]. The effect will be similar to that of an [[extension tube]], because the lens will be mounted further from the image plane than intended. Some lens adapters utilize an optical element to compensate for this, effectively acting as a [[teleconverter]]. This introduces the typical side effects of a teleconverter, namely decreasing the amount of light that reaches the sensor, and adding a [[crop factor]] to the lens.

Additionally, there are several secondary factors to consider. Lenses designed for a smaller image sensor may not be adaptable to camera bodies with larger sensors as the [[image circle]] may not be large enough to cover the entire sensor, and will therefore exhibit [[vignetting]]. The age of the camera body may limit the availability of adapters; as camera bodies typically reach obsolescence before lenses. Finally, some adapters may include electronic or mechanical provisions in order to control the [[lens aperture]] and [[autofocus]], to record the correct [[Exif]] data, or to report focus confirmation.

The following table shows commonly available adapters that don't require an optical element.&lt;ref name="similaar"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lens mount compatibility chart |url=http://www.similaar.com/foto/lensmount/lensmount.html |access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

†Image may exhibit vignetting due to sensor size.

‡Theoretically possible, but may be difficult to find.

∗Although the camera's flange distance is shorter than the lens', there is not enough distance between the flange and the lens to integrate the bayonet.

'''''Man and Power: the Story of Power from the Pyramids to the Atomic Age''''' is a [[science book]] for children by [[L. Sprague de Camp]], illustrated with documents and photographs, and with paintings by [[Alton S. Tobey]], first published in hardcover by [[Golden Press]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Laughlin | first=Charlotte |author2=Daniel J. H. Levack | title=De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography | location=San Francisco | publisher=Underwood/Miller | pages=79–80 | year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISFDB"&gt;{{isfdb title|id=1556460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
As stated on the cover, the work is a survey of "the story of power from the pyramids to the atomic age." It traces the "progression of man's discovery and utilization of power ... in chapters dealing consecutively with the different sources of power--animal, wind, water, steam, internal combustion, chemical, electrical, and nuclear power, and possible future sources."&lt;ref name="BL1"&gt;''The Booklist'', v. 58, no. 4, Oct. 15, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial Contents==
*Manpower
*Animal Power
*Wind Power
*Water Power
*Steam Power
*Internal-combustion Power
*Chemical Power
*Electric Power
*Nuclear Power

==Reception==
Thomas Goonan, writing for ''[[Library Journal]]'', rated the book "[r]ecommended," praising its "[e]xcellent illustrations" that "elucidate the text" and "[g]ood index. Comparing it to Edward Stoddard's ''The Story of Power'', he judged de Camp's work "[m]ore comprehensive and 
detailed."&lt;ref&gt;Goonan, Thomas. "de CAMP, L. Sprague. Man and Power" (review) in ''Library Journal'', v. 86, no. 13, July 1961, p. 2540.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Science News-Letter'', in its September 23, 1961 issue, listed the book among its "Books of the Week," describing the work as a "[c]olorful panorama depicting and describing man's development of sources of energy to help him build, move around and produce."&lt;ref name="SNL"&gt;"Books of the Week" in ''The Science News-Letter'', v. 80, no. 13, September 23, 1961, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Booklist|The Booklist]]'' considered the subject "effectively presented in well-written text and a multitude of supplementary [illustrative materials], all captioned and most of them in color. Its review repeated Goonan's judgment of the work as "more comprehensive" than Stoddard's.&lt;ref name="BL1"/&gt; In appraising the work for older children, ''The Booklist'' noted it was "[j]uvenile in approach but may be useful in high schools, particularly for its illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;''The Booklist'', v. 58, no. 4, Oct. 15, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Asimov]], writing for ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'', called it "an exciting book written with great authority and illustrated lavishly," noting that "[f]or young people interested in mechanics and machinery this book is a complete feast." He finds that "[t]he human mind is the hero throughout," with "[t]he personalities of scientists interest[ing] Mr. de Camp only as they affect the scientists as conveyors of new thoughts."&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac. "Views on Science Books" in ''The Horn Book Magazine'', v. 37, no. 5, October 1961, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claire Huchet Bishop]] in ''The Commonweal'' praised the book's "[e]xcellent approach which makes less of the machines than it does of the minds that created them."&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Claire Huchet. "Machines and Men" in ''The Commonweal'', v. 75, no. 7, November 10, 1961, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry W. Hubbard in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that "Mr. de Camp has filled his book with accurate information and absorbing history," but noted that while "[t]he writing is usually good, ... the first chapter, on manpower, suffers from jarring transitions, and the detailed explanations of steam engines and such are occasionally hard to follow." He finds the illustrations "colorful and skillfully chosen. They are, in fact, the high point of the book." Summing up, he states that "[b]y virtue of its thoroughness, and its informative illustrations, "Man and Power" should be especially useful in libraries and schools."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, Henry W. "Harnessing Nature" in ''The New York Times'', November 12, 1961, p. BRA30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, an exposé on the [[ABC Television|ABCTV]] current affairs program ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' revealed poor processing techniques in certain Indonesian [[abattoir]]s. Facilities included in the program had received training and equipment from Australia's live export industry, including MLA, and Government through a co-funded [[animal welfare]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2011/s3228880.htm|title=Four Corners|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From mid-2011, the [[Australian Government]] has required the adoption of a new regulatory framework for Indonesian supply chains, including independent auditing, to provide greater oversight and accountability of in-market operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/market-access-trade/iac/live-animal-trade |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227220659/http://www.daff.gov.au/market-access-trade/iac/live-animal-trade |archivedate=27 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10303">In the [[scale-free network]] theory ([[network theory|mathematical theory of networks]] or [[graph theory]]), a '''mediation-driven attachment (MDA) model''' appears to embody a [[preferential attachment]] rule tacitly rather than explicitly. According to MDA rule, a new node first picks a node from the existing network at random and connect itself not with that but with one of the neighbors also picked at random.

Barabasi and Albert in 1999 noted through their seminal paper &lt;ref&gt;A. -L. Barab\'{a}si and R. Albert, Science '''286''' 509 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; noted that (i) most natural and man-made  networks are not static, rather they grow with time and (ii) new nodes do not connect with an already connected one randomly rather preferentially with respect to their degrees. The later mechanism is called preferential attachment (PA) rule which embodies the rich get richer phenomena in economics. In their first model, known as the [[Barabási–Albert model]], Barabási and Albert (BA model) choose

: &lt;math&gt; \Pi(i) = \frac{k_i}{\sum_{j=1} k_j}&lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that the new node picks a node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; from the labelled nodes of the existing network. It directly embodies the rich get richer mechanism.

Recently, Hassan ''et al.'' proposed a mediation-driven attachment model which appears to embody the PA rule but not directly rather in disguise.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan, Liana Islam and Syed Arefinul Haque, Degree distribution, rank-size distribution, and leadership persistence in mediation-driven attachment networks Physica A 469 23 (2017) https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2016.11.001&lt;/ref&gt; In the MDA model, an incoming node choose an existing node to connect by first picking one of the existing nodes at random which is regarded as mediator. The new node then connect with one of the neighbors of the mediator which is also picked at random. Now the question is: What is the probability &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; that an already existing node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is finally picked to connect it with the new node? Say, the node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; has degree &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; and hence it has &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; neighbors. Consider that the neighbors of  &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; are labeled &lt;math&gt;1,2,\ldots ,k_i&lt;/math&gt; which have degrees &lt;math&gt;k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_{k_i}&lt;/math&gt; respectively. One can reach the node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; from each of these &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; nodes with probabilities inverse of their respective degrees, and each of the &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; nodes are likely to be picked at random with probability &lt;math&gt;1/N&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the probability &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; of the MDA model is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)= \frac 1 N \left[ \frac 1 {k_1}+ \frac 1 {k_2} + \cdots + \frac 1 {k_{k_i}} \right] =\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{k_i} \frac 1 {k_j}} N.&lt;/math&gt;
It can be re-written as

: &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i) = \frac{k_i}N \cdot \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{k_i} \frac 1 {k_j}}{k_i},&lt;/math&gt;

where the factor &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{k_i}{\frac{1}{k_j}}}{k_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse of the harmonic mean (IHM) of degrees of the &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; neighbors of the node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Extensive numerical simulation suggest that for small &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the IHM value of each node fluctuate so wildly that the mean of the IHM values over the entire network bears no meaning. However, for large &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; (specially &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; approximately greater than 14) the distribution of IHM value of the entire network become left skewed Gaussian type and mean starts to have a meaning which becomes a constant value in the large &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; limit. In this limit one finds that &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)\propto k_i&lt;/math&gt; which is exactly the PA rule. It implies that the higher the links (degree) a node has, the higher its chance of gaining more links since they can be reached in a larger number of ways through mediators which essentially embodies the intuitive idea of rich get richer mechanism. Therefore, the MDA network can be seen to follow the PA rule but in disguise. Moreover, for small &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the MFA is no longer valid rather the attachment probability &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; becomes super-preferential in character.

The idea of MDA rule can be found in the growth process of the [[weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL)]]. An existing node (the center of each block of the WPSL is regarded as nodes and the common border between blocks as the links between the corresponding nodes) during the process gain links only if one of its neighbor is picked not itself. It implies that the higher the links (or degree) a node has, the higher its chance of gaining more links since they can be reached in a larger number of ways. It essentially embodies the intuitive idea of PA rule. Therefore, the dual of the WPSL is a network which can be seen to follow preferential attachment rule but in disguise. Indeed, its degree distribution is found to exhibit power-law as underlined by Barabasi and Albert as one of the essential ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan, M. Z. Hassan and N. I. Pavel, “Scale-free network topology and multifractality in a  weighted planar stochastic lattice” New Journal of Physics '''12''' 093045 ( 2010) http://doi:10{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.1088/1367-2630/12/9/093045&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan, M. Z. Hassan and N. I. Pavel, Scale-free coordination number disorder and multifractal size disorder in weighted planar stochastic lattice, J. Phys: Conf. Ser, '''297''' 012010 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mediation-driven attachment network of size 256 nodes.pdf|thumb|Mediation-driven attachment network of size 256 nodes]]

[[Degree distribution:]] The two factors that the mean of the IHM is meaningful and it is independent of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; 
implies that one can apply the mean-field approximation (MFA). That is, within this approximation one can replace the true IHM value &lt;math&gt;\beta/m&lt;/math&gt; of each node by their mean, where the factor &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; that the number of edges the new nodes come with is introduced for latter convenience. The rate equation to solve then becomes exactly like that of the BA model and hence the network that emerges following MDA rule is also [[scale-free]] in nature. The only difference is that the exponent &lt;math&gt;\gamma={{1}\over{\beta(m)}}+1&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; where as in the BA model &lt;math&gt;\gamma=3&lt;/math&gt; independent of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Deg dist gm-page-0.jpg|thumb|Plots of degree distribution for the MDA model. The distinct plots are for incoming nodes coming edges ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15 and ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;100. In the inset we show the variation in the exponent of the degree distribution as a function of&amp;nbsp;''m''.]]

==Leadership persistence probability==
In the growing network not all nodes are equally important. The extent of their importance is measured by the value of their degree &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Nodes which are linked to an unusually large number of other nodes, i.e. nodes with exceptionally high &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; value, are known as hubs. They are special because their existence make the mean distance, measured in units of the number of links, between nodes incredibly small thereby playing the key role in spreading rumors, opinions, diseases, computer viruses etc.&lt;ref&gt;R. Pastor-Satorras, A. Vespignani., Phys. Rev. Lett. '''86''' 3200(2001).&lt;/ref&gt; It is, therefore, important to know the properties of the largest hub, which we regard as the leader. Like in society, the leadership in a growing network is not permanent. That is, once a node becomes the leader, it does not mean that it remains the leader ''ad infinitum''. An interesting question is: how long does the leader retain this leadership property as the network evolves? To find an answer to this question, we define the leadership persistence probability &lt;math&gt;F(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; that aleader retains its leadership for at least up to time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Persistence probability has been of interest in many different systems ranging from coarsening dynamics to fluctuating interfaces or polymer chains.

[[File:Persistence-page-0.jpg|thumb|The two plots at the top reveal the power-law behavior of the leadership persistence probability. To appreciate the role of m we give leadership persistence probability for two values (m=1 and m=100) in the same plot: (a) BA networks and (b) MDA networks. The two plots at the bottom are for the persistence exponent as a function of m in (c) BA networks and (d) MDA networks.]]

The basic idea of the MDA rule is, however not completely new as either this or models similar to this can be found in a few earlier works, albeit their approach, ensuing analysis and their results are different from ours. For instance, Saramaki and Kaski presented a random-walk based model.&lt;ref&gt;Saramaki and K. Kaski, Physica A '''341''', 80 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Another model proposed by Boccaletti  ''et al.'' may appear similar to ours, but it markedly differs on closer look.&lt;ref&gt;S. Boccaletti, D.-U. Hwang and V. Latora, I. J. Bifurcation and Chaos '''17''' 2447  (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently, Yang {\it et al.} too gave a form for &lt;math&gt;\Pi(i)&lt;/math&gt; and resorted to mean-field approximation.&lt;ref&gt;X.-H. Yang, S. -L. Lou, G. Chen, S.-Y. Chen, W. Huang, Physica A
'''392''' 3531 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the nature of their expressions are significantly different from the one studied by Hassan ''et al.''. Yet another closely related model is the Growing Network with Redirection (GNR) model presented by Gabel, Krapivsky and Redner where at each time step a new node either attaches to a randomly chosen target node with probability  &lt;math&gt;1-r&lt;/math&gt;, or to the parent of the target with probability  &lt;math&gt;r=1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Krapivsky and S. Redner, Phys. Rev. E '''63''', 066123 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The GNR model with &lt;math&gt;r=1&lt;/math&gt; may appear similar to the MDA model. However,  it should be noted that unlike the GNR model, the MDA model is for undirected networks, and that the new link can connect with any neighbor of the mediator-parent or not. One more difference is that, in the MDA model new node may join the existing network with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; edges and in the GNR model it is considered &lt;math&gt;m=1&lt;/math&gt; case only.

'''Michel Callon''' (born 1945) is a professor of sociology at the [[École des mines de Paris]] and member of the [[Centre de sociologie de l'innovation]]. He is an influential author in the field of [[Science and Technology Studies]] and one of the leading proponents of [[actor–network theory]] (ANT) with [[Bruno Latour]].

== Recent career ==
In recent years (since the late 1990s), Michel Callon has spearheaded the movement of applying ANT approaches to study economic life (notably economic markets). This body of work interrogates the interrelation between the economy and economics, highlighting the ways in which economics (and economics-inspired disciplines such as marketing) shapes the economy (see Callon, 1998 and 2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2132">The '''microwave scanning beam landing system''' (MSBLS) was a [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] approach and landing navigation aid used by [[NASA]]'s [[space shuttle]]. It provided precise elevation, directional and distance data which was used to guide the orbiter for the last two minutes of flight until touchdown. The signal was typically usable from a horizontal distance of approximately 28&amp;nbsp;km and from an altitude of approximately 5&amp;nbsp;km (18,000 feet).

MSBLS installations used by NASA had to be certified every two years for accuracy. From 2004, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] worked with NASA to execute this verification; previously, only NASA aircraft and equipment were used. Testing of the [[Kennedy Space Center]]'s MSBLS in 2004 revealed an accuracy of 5 centimeters.

The shuttle landing approach started with a [[glide slope]] of 19 degrees, which is over six times steeper than the typical 3-degree slope of commercial jet airliners.

'''Modified Newtonian dynamics''' ('''MOND''') is a theory that proposes a modification of [[Newton's laws]] to account for observed properties of [[galaxies]]. It is an alternative to the theory of [[dark matter]] in terms of explaining why galaxies do not appear to obey the currently understood laws of physics.

Created in 1982 and first published in 1983 by Israeli physicist [[Mordehai Milgrom]],&lt;ref name="Milgrom papers"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Milgrom |first=M. |date=1983 |title=A modification of the Newtonian dynamics as a possible alternative to the hidden mass hypothesis |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=270 |issue= |pages=365–370 |doi=10.1086/161130 |issn= |bibcode=1983ApJ...270..365M}}. {{Cite journal |last=Milgrom |first=M. |date=1983 |title=A modification of the Newtonian dynamics - Implications for galaxies |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=270 |issue= |pages=371–389 |doi=10.1086/161131 |issn= |bibcode=1983ApJ...270..371M}}. {{Cite journal |last=Milgrom |first=M. |date=1983 |title=A modification of the Newtonian dynamics - Implications for galaxy systems |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=270 |issue= |pages= 384|doi= 10.1086/161132 |issn= |bibcode=1983ApJ...270..384M}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the theory's original motivation was to explain that the velocities of stars in galaxies were observed to be larger than expected based on Newtonian mechanics. Milgrom noted that this discrepancy could be resolved if the [[gravitational force]] experienced by a star in the outer regions of a galaxy was proportional to the square of its centripetal [[acceleration]] (as opposed to the centripetal acceleration itself, as in [[Newton's second law]]), or alternatively if gravitational force came to vary inversely with radius (as opposed to the inverse square of the radius, as in [[Newton's law of gravity]]). In MOND, violation of Newton's laws occurs at extremely small accelerations, characteristic of galaxies yet far below anything typically encountered in the [[Solar System]] or on Earth.

}}

MOND is an example of a class of theories known as [[modified models of gravity|modified gravity]], and is an alternative to the hypothesis that the dynamics of galaxies are determined by massive, invisible [[dark matter halo]]s. Since Milgrom's original proposal, MOND has successfully predicted a variety of galactic phenomena that are difficult to understand from a [[dark matter]] perspective.&lt;ref name="tale of two paradigms"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = McGaugh | first = S. | title = A Tale of Two Paradigms: the Mutual Incommensurability of LCDM and MOND | date=2014 | arxiv = 1404.7525|bibcode = 2015CaJPh..93..250M |doi = 10.1139/cjp-2014-0203 | volume=93 | issue = 2 | journal=Canadian Journal of Physics | pages=250–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kroupa, P.|author2=Pawlowski, M.|author3=Milgrom, M.|year=2012|title=The failures of the standard model of cosmology require a new paradigm|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D|volume=21|issue=14|page= 1230003|doi=10.1142/S0218271812300030|arxiv=1301.3907|bibcode=2012IJMPD..2130003K}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, MOND and its generalisations do not adequately account for observed properties of [[galaxy clusters]], and no satisfactory [[cosmological model]] has been constructed from the theory.

The accurate measurement of the speed of gravitational waves compared to the speed of light in 2017 ruled out many theories which used modified gravity to explain dark matter.&lt;ref name="Boran"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Boran|first=Sibel|last2=Desai|first2=Shantanu|last3=Kahya|first3=Emre|last4=Woodard|first4=Richard|date=2017-10-17|title=GW170817 Falsifies Dark Matter Emulators|eprint=1710.06168|class=astro-ph.HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, both Milgrom’s bi-metric formulation of MOND and nonlocal MOND are not ruled out according to the same study.

Several independent observations point to the fact that the visible mass in galaxies and galaxy clusters is insufficient to account for their dynamics, when analysed using Newton's laws. This discrepancy – known as the "missing mass problem" – was first identified for clusters by Swiss astronomer [[Fritz Zwicky]] in 1933 (who studied the [[Coma cluster]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zwicky |first=F. |date=1933 |title=Die Rotverschiebung von extragalaktischen Nebeln |journal=Helvetica Physica Acta |volume=6|pages=110–127 |bibcode=1933AcHPh...6..110Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zwicky | first=F. |title=On the Masses of Nebulae and of Clusters of Nebulae |date=1937 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=86 |page=217 | bibcode =1937ApJ....86..217Z |doi=10.1086/143864}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently extended to include [[spiral galaxies]] by the 1939 work of [[Horace Babcock]] on [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda]].&lt;ref&gt;Babcock, H, 1939, "[http://ads.nao.ac.jp/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1939LicOB..19...41B&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf The rotation of the Andromeda Nebula]", Lick Observatory bulletin ; no. 498&lt;/ref&gt; These early studies were augmented and brought to the attention of the astronomical community in the 1960s and 1970s by the work of [[Vera Rubin]] at the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institute]] in Washington, who mapped in detail the rotation velocities of stars in a large sample of spirals. While Newton's Laws predict that stellar rotation velocities should decrease with distance from the galactic centre, Rubin and collaborators found instead that they remain almost constant&lt;ref name="Rubin1970"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Rubin |first1=Vera C. |authorlink1=Vera Rubin |last2=Ford |first2=W. Kent, Jr. |authorlink2=Kent Ford (astronomer) |date=February 1970  |title=Rotation of the Andromeda Nebula from a Spectroscopic Survey of Emission Regions |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=159 |pages=379–403 |bibcode=1970ApJ...159..379R | doi=10.1086/150317}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the [[rotation curves]] are said to be "flat". This observation necessitates at least one of the following: 1) There exists in galaxies large quantities of unseen matter which boosts the stars' velocities beyond what would be expected on the basis of the visible mass alone, or 2) Newton's Laws do not apply to galaxies. The former leads to the dark matter hypothesis; the latter leads to MOND.

[[Image:Milgrom Mordechai.jpg|thumb|frame|upright 1.0| MOND was proposed by Mordehai Milgrom in 1983]]

The basic premise of MOND is that while Newton's laws have been extensively tested in high-acceleration environments (in the Solar System and on Earth), they have not been verified for objects with extremely low acceleration, such as stars in the outer parts of galaxies. This led Milgrom to postulate a new effective gravitational force law (sometimes referred to as "Milgrom's law") that relates the true acceleration of an object to the acceleration that would be predicted for it on the basis of Newtonian mechanics.&lt;ref name="Milgrom papers"/&gt; This law, the keystone of MOND, is chosen to reduce to the Newtonian result at high acceleration but lead to different ("deep-MOND") behaviour at low acceleration:

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; F_N = m \mu \left( \frac{a}{a_0} \right) a. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Here ''F&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the Newtonian force, ''m'' is the object's (gravitational) [[mass]], ''a'' is its acceleration, ''μ''(''x'') is an as-yet unspecified function (known as the "interpolating function"), and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a new fundamental constant which marks the transition between the Newtonian and deep-MOND regimes. Agreement with Newtonian mechanics requires 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \mu(x) \to 1 &amp;&amp; \text{for } x \gg 1, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and consistency with astronomical observations requires

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \mu(x) \to x &amp;&amp; \text{for } x \ll 1. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Beyond these limits, the interpolating function is not specified by the theory, although it is possible to weakly constrain it empirically.&lt;ref&gt;G. Gentile, B. Famaey, W.J.G. de Blok (2011). "THINGS about MOND", Astron. Astrophys. '''527''', A76. {{arxiv|1011.4148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Famaey, J. Binney (2005), "Modified Newtonian Dynamics in the Milky Way", MNRAS, {{arxiv|astro-ph/0506723}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two common choices are the "simple interpolating function":

:&lt;math&gt; \mu \left( \frac{a}{a_0} \right) = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{a_0}{a}},&lt;/math&gt;

and the "standard interpolating function":

:&lt;math&gt; \mu \left( \frac{a}{a_0} \right) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{a_0}{a}\right)^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, in the deep-MOND regime (''a'' ≪ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt; F_N = m \frac{a^2}{a_0}. &lt;/math&gt;

Applying this to an object of mass ''m'' in [[circular orbit]] around a point mass ''M'' (a crude approximation for a star in the outer regions of a galaxy), we find:

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \frac{G M m}{r^2} = m \frac{\left( \frac{v^2}{r} \right)^2}{a_0} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad v^4 = G M a_0 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

that is, the star's rotation velocity is independent of ''r'', its distance from the centre of the galaxy – the rotation curve is flat, as required. By fitting his law to rotation curve data, Milgrom found &lt;math&gt;a_0 \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{ms}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; to be optimal. This simple law is sufficient to make predictions for a broad range of galactic phenomena.

Milgrom's law can be interpreted in two different ways. One possibility is to treat it as a modification to the classical [[law of inertia]] (Newton's second law), so that the force on an object is not proportional to the particle's acceleration ''a'' but rather to ''μ''(''a''/''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)''a''. In this case, the modified dynamics would apply not only to gravitational phenomena, but also those generated by other [[forces]], for example [[electromagnetism]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Milgrom, "MOND - Particularly as Modified Inertia", {{arxiv|1111.1611}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, Milgrom's law can be viewed as leaving Newton's Second Law intact and instead modifying the inverse-square law of gravity, so that the true gravitational force on an object of mass ''m'' due to another of mass ''M'' is roughly of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{GMm}{\mu \left (\frac{a}{a_0} \right ) r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this interpretation, Milgrom's modification would apply exclusively to gravitational phenomena.

By itself, Milgrom's law is not a complete and self-contained [[physical theory]], but rather an ad-hoc empirically motivated variant of one of the several equations that constitute classical mechanics. Its status within a coherent non-relativistic theory of MOND is akin to [[Kepler's Third Law]] within Newtonian mechanics; it provides a succinct description of observational facts, but must itself be explained by more fundamental concepts situated within the underlying theory. Several complete classical theories have been proposed (typically along "modified gravity" as opposed to "modified inertia" lines), which generally yield Milgrom's law exactly in situations of high [[symmetry]] and otherwise deviate from it slightly. A subset of these non-relativistic theories have been further embedded within relativistic theories, which are capable of making contact with non-classical phenomena (e.g., [[gravitational lensing]]) and [[cosmology]].&lt;ref name = "famaey mcgaugh"&gt;B. Famaey and S. McGaugh, "Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND): Observational Phenomenology and Relativistic Extensions", {{arxiv|1112.3960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinguishing both theoretically and observationally between these alternatives is a subject of current research.

The majority of [[astronomers]], [[astrophysicists]] and [[cosmologists]] accept [[ΛCDM]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPVGDXNSBZM Pavel Kroupa – The vast polar structures around the Milky Way and Andromeda, YouTube, Nov. 18, 2013] [[Pavel Kroupa]] claims that the majority opinion is wrong and that empirical evidence rules out the ΛCDM model.&lt;/ref&gt; (based on general relativity, and hence Newtonian mechanics), and are committed to a dark matter solution of the missing-mass problem. MOND, by contrast, is actively studied by only a handful of researchers. The primary difference between supporters of ΛCDM and MOND is in the observations for which they demand a robust, quantitative explanation and those for which they are satisfied with a qualitative account, or are prepared to leave for future work. Proponents of MOND emphasize predictions made on galaxy scales (where MOND enjoys its most notable successes) and believe that a cosmological model consistent with galaxy dynamics has yet to be discovered; proponents of ΛCDM require high levels of cosmological accuracy (which concordance cosmology provides) and argue that a resolution of galaxy-scale issues will follow from a better understanding of the complicated baryonic astrophysics underlying [[galaxy formation]].&lt;ref name="tale of two paradigms"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sanders, R.

== Observational evidence for MOND ==

Since MOND was specifically designed to produce flat rotation curves, these do not constitute evidence for the theory, but every matching observation adds to support of the empirical law. Nevertheless, a broad range of astrophysical phenomena are neatly accounted for within the MOND framework.&lt;ref name="famaey mcgaugh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Milgrom (2013), "MOND Laws of Galaxy Dynamics", {{arxiv|1212.2568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these came to light after the publication of Milgrom's original papers and are difficult to explain using the alternative dark matter hypothesis. The most prominent are the following:

* In addition to demonstrating that rotation curves in MOND are flat, equation 2 provides a concrete relation between a galaxy's total baryonic mass (the sum of its mass in stars and gas) and its asymptotic rotation velocity. Observationally, this is known as the baryonic [[Tully–Fisher relation]] (BTFR),&lt;ref&gt;S. S. McGaugh, J. M. Schombert, G. D. Bothun,2 and W. J. G. de Blok (2000), "The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation", {{arxiv|astro-ph/0003001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is found to conform quite closely to the MOND prediction.&lt;ref&gt;S. McGaugh (2011), "The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation of Gas-Rich Galaxies as a Test of ΛCDM and MOND", ApJ, {{arxiv|1107.2934}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Milgrom's law fully specifies the rotation curve of a galaxy given only the distribution of its baryonic mass. In particular, MOND predicts a far stronger correlation between features in the baryonic mass distribution and features in the rotation curve than does the dark matter hypothesis (since dark matter dominates the galaxy's mass budget and is conventionally assumed not to closely track the distribution of baryons). Such a tight correlation is claimed to be observed in several spiral galaxies, a fact which has been referred to as "Renzo's rule".&lt;ref name = "famaey mcgaugh"/&gt;
* Since MOND modifies Newtonian dynamics in an acceleration-dependent way, it predicts a specific relationship between the acceleration of a star at any radius from the centre of a galaxy and the amount of unseen (dark matter) mass within that radius that would be inferred in a Newtonian analysis. This is known as the "mass discrepancy-acceleration relation", and has been measured observationally.&lt;ref&gt;R. Sanders, "Mass discrepancies in galaxies: dark matter and alternatives", The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review 1990, Volume 2, Issue 1, pp 1-28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. McGaugh (2004), "The Mass Discrepancy-Acceleration Relation: Disk Mass and the Dark Matter Distribution", ApJ, {{arxiv|astro-ph/0403610}}&lt;/ref&gt; One aspect of the MOND prediction is that the mass of the inferred dark matter go to zero when the stellar centripetal acceleration becomes greater than ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where MOND reverts to Newtonian mechanics. In dark matter theory, it is a challenge to understand why this mass should correlate so closely with acceleration, and why there appears to be a critical acceleration above which dark matter is not required.&lt;ref name = "tale of two paradigms"/&gt;
* Both MOND and dark matter halos stabilise disk galaxies, helping them retain their rotation-supported structure and preventing their transformation into [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]. In MOND, this added stability is only available for regions of galaxies within the deep-MOND regime (i.e., with ''a'' &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), suggesting that spirals with ''a'' &gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in their central regions should be prone to instabilities and hence less likely to survive to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Jimenez and X. Hernandez (2014), "Local galactic disk stability under MONDian gravity", {{arxiv|1406.0537}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may explain the "[[Ken Freeman (astronomer)|Freeman]] limit" to the observed central surface mass density of spiral galaxies, which is roughly ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGaugh | first1 = S. | date = 1998 | title = Testing the Hypothesis of Modified Dynamics with Low Surface Brightness Galaxies and Other Evidence | url = | journal = Astrophys J | volume = 499 | issue = | pages = 66–81 | doi=10.1086/305629 | bibcode=1998ApJ...499...66M|arxiv = astro-ph/9801102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This scale must be put in by hand in dark matter-based galaxy formation models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGaugh | first1 = S. | date = 2005 | title = Balance of Dark and Luminous Mass in Rotating Galaxies | url = | journal = Phys.

* Particularly massive galaxies are within the Newtonian regime (''a'' &gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) out to radii enclosing the vast majority of their baryonic mass. At these radii, MOND predicts that the rotation curve should fall as 1/''r'', in accordance with [[Kepler's Laws]]. In contrast, from a dark matter perspective one would expect the halo to significantly boost the rotation velocity and cause it to asymptote to a constant value, as in less massive galaxies. Observations of high-mass ellipticals bear out the MOND prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Romanowsky | first1 = A.J. | last2 = Douglas | first2 = N.G. | last3 = Arnaboldi | first3 = M. | last4 = Kuijken | first4 = K. | last5 = Merrifield | first5 = M.R. | last6 = Napolitano | first6 = N.R. | last7 = Capaccioli | first7 = M. | last8 = Freeman | first8 = K.C. | date = 2003 | title = A Dearth of Dark Matter in Ordinary Elliptical Galaxies | url = | journal = Science | volume = 301 | issue = 5640| pages = 1696–1698 |arxiv=astro-ph/0308518 | doi=10.1126/science.1087441 | pmid=12947033|bibcode = 2003Sci...301.1696R }}&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Milgrom | first1 = M. | last2 = Sanders | first2 = R.H. | date = 2003 | title = Modified Newtonian Dynamics and the 'Dearth of Dark Matter in Ordinary Elliptical Galaxies' | url = | journal = Astrophys J | volume = 599 | issue = | pages = 25–28 | arxiv = astro-ph/0309617 |bibcode = 2003ApJ...599L..25M |doi = 10.1086/381138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In MOND, all gravitationally bound objects with ''a'' &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; – regardless of their origin – should exhibit a mass discrepancy when analysed using Newtonian mechanics, and should lie on the BTFR. Under the dark matter hypothesis, objects formed from baryonic material ejected during the merger or tidal interaction of two galaxies ("[[dwarf galaxy|tidal dwarf galaxies]]") are expected to be devoid of dark matter and hence show no mass discrepancy. Three objects unambiguously identified as Tidal Dwarf Galaxies appear to have mass discrepancies in close agreement with the MOND prediction.&lt;ref&gt;F. Bournaud, P.-A. Duc, E. Brinks, M.

Kroupa (2012), "The dark matter crisis: falsification of the current standard model of cosmology", {{arxiv|1204.2546}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Recent work has shown that many of the dwarf galaxies around the [[Milky Way]] and Andromeda are located preferentially in a single plane and have correlated motions. This suggests that they may have formed during a close encounter with another galaxy and hence be Tidal Dwarf Galaxies. If so, the presence of mass discrepancies in these systems constitutes further evidence for MOND. In addition, it has been claimed that a gravitational force stronger than Newton's (such as Milgrom's) is required for these galaxies to retain their orbits over time.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kroupa (2014), "Lessons from the Local Group (and beyond) on dark matter", {{arxiv|1409.6302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complete MOND theories ==

Milgrom's law requires incorporation into a complete theory if it is to satisfy [[conservation laws]] and provide a unique solution for the time evolution of any physical system. Each of the theories described here reduce to Milgrom's law in situations of high symmetry (and thus enjoy the successes described above), but produce different behaviour in detail.

=== Nonrelativistic ===

The first complete theory of MOND (dubbed [[AQUAL]]) was constructed in 1984 by Milgrom and [[Jacob Bekenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jacob Bekenstein |author2=M. Milgrom |last-author-amp=yes |title=Does the missing mass problem signal the breakdown of Newtonian gravity?|journal=Astrophys. J.|volume=286|pages=7–14|date=1984|bibcode = 1984ApJ...286....7B |doi = 10.1086/162570 }}&lt;/ref&gt; AQUAL generates MONDian behaviour by modifying the gravitational term in the classical [[lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] from being quadratic in the gradient of the Newtonian potential to a more general function. (AQUAL is an acronym for AQUAdratic Lagrangian.) In formulae:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\text{Newton} &amp;= - \frac{1}{8 \pi G} \cdot \|\nabla \phi\|^2 \\ [6pt]
\mathcal{L}_\text{AQUAL}  &amp;= - \frac{1}{8 \pi G} \cdot a_0^2 F \left (\tfrac{\|\nabla \phi\|^2}{a_0^2} \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the standard Newtonian gravitational potential and ''F'' is a new dimensionless function. Applying the [[Euler–Lagrange equations]] in the standard way then leads to a non-linear generalisation of the [[Poisson's equation|Newton–Poisson equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla\cdot\left[ \mu \left( \frac{\left\| \nabla\phi \right\|}{a_0} \right) \nabla\phi\right] = 4\pi G \rho &lt;/math&gt;

This can be solved given suitable boundary conditions and choice of F to yield Milgrom's law (up to a [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] field correction which vanishes in situations of high symmetry).

An alternative way to modify the gravitational term in the lagrangian is to introduce a distinction between the true (MONDian) acceleration field '''a''' and the Newtonian acceleration field '''a&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'''. The Lagrangian may be constructed so that '''a&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''' satisfies the usual Newton-Poisson equation, and is then used to find '''a''' via an additional algebraic but non-linear step, which is chosen to satisfy Milgrom's law. This is called the "quasi-linear formulation of MOND", or QUMOND,&lt;ref&gt;M. Milgrom (2010), "Quasi-linear formulation of MOND", {{arxiv|0911.5464}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is particularly useful for calculating the distribution of "phantom" dark matter that would be inferred from a Newtonian analysis of a given physical situation.&lt;ref name = "famaey mcgaugh"/&gt;

Both AQUAL and QUMOND propose changes to the gravitational part of the classical matter action, and hence interpret Milgrom's law as a modification of Newtonian gravity as opposed to Newton's second law. The alternative is to turn the kinetic term of the action into a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] depending on the trajectory of the particle. Such "modified inertia" theories, however, are difficult to use because they are time-nonlocal, require [[energy]] and [[momentum]] to be non-trivially redefined to be conserved, and have predictions that depend on the entirety of a particle's orbit.&lt;ref name = "famaey mcgaugh"/&gt;

=== Relativistic ===

In 2004, Jacob Bekenstein formulated [[TeVeS]], the first complete relativistic theory with MONDian behaviour.&lt;ref name=Bekenstein&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/0403694 |title=Relativistic gravitation theory for the MOND paradigm |author=Jacob D.

TeVeS has enjoyed some success in making contact with gravitational lensing and [[structure formation]] observations,&lt;ref&gt;T. Clifton, P. G. Ferreira, A. Padilla, C.

Several alternative relativistic generalisations of MOND exist, including BIMOND and generalised Einstein-Aether theories.&lt;ref name = "famaey mcgaugh"/&gt; There is also a relativistic generalisation of MOND that assumes a Lorentz-type invariance as the physical basis of MOND phenomenology.&lt;ref name = "alzain"&gt;M. Alzain, "MOND as a modification of Newtonian inertia", {{arxiv|1708.05385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The external field effect ==

In Newtonian mechanics, an object's acceleration can be found as the vector sum of the acceleration due to each of the individual forces acting on it. This means that a [[subsystem]] can be decoupled from the larger system in which it is embedded simply by referring the motion of its constituent particles to their centre of mass; in other words, the influence of the larger system is irrelevant for the internal dynamics of the subsystem. Since Milgrom's law is [[non-linear]] in acceleration, MONDian subsystems cannot be decoupled from their environment in this way, and in certain situations this leads to behaviour with no Newtonian parallel. This is known as the "external field effect" (EFE).&lt;ref name = "Milgrom papers"/&gt;

The external field effect is best described by classifying physical systems according to their relative values of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; (the characteristic acceleration of one object within a subsystem due to the influence of another), ''a''&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; (the acceleration of the entire subsystem due to forces exerted by objects outside of it), and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:

* &lt;math&gt; a_{\mathrm{in}} &gt; a_0 &lt;/math&gt; :  Newtonian regime

* &lt;math&gt; a_{\mathrm{ex}} &lt; a_{\mathrm{in}} &lt; a_0 &lt;/math&gt; :  Deep-MOND regime

* &lt;math&gt; a_{\mathrm{in}} &lt; a_0 &lt; a_{\mathrm{ex}} &lt;/math&gt; : The external field is dominant and the behaviour of the system is Newtonian.

* &lt;math&gt; a_{\mathrm{in}} &lt; a_{\mathrm{ex}} &lt; a_0 &lt;/math&gt; : The external field is larger than the internal acceleration of the system, but both are smaller than the critical value. In this case, dynamics is Newtonian but the effective value of ''G'' is enhanced by a factor of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/''a''&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;S. McGaugh, [http://www.astro.umd.edu/~ssm/mond/EFE.html The EFE in MOND]&lt;/ref&gt;

The external field effect implies a fundamental break with the [[strong equivalence principle]] (but not necessarily the [[weak equivalence principle]]). The effect was postulated by Milgrom in the first of his 1983 papers to explain why some [[open clusters]] were observed to have no mass discrepancy even though their internal accelerations were below a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. It has since come to be recognised as a crucial element of the MOND paradigm.

The dependence in MOND of the internal dynamics of a system on its external environment (in principle, the rest of the [[universe]]) is strongly reminiscent of [[Mach's principle]], and may hint towards a more fundamental structure underlying Milgrom's law. In this regard, Milgrom has commented:&lt;ref&gt;M. Milgrom (2008), "The MOND paradigm", {{arxiv|0801.3133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been long suspected that local dynamics is strongly influenced by the universe at large, a-la Mach's principle, but MOND seems to be the first to supply concrete evidence for such a connection. This may turn out to be the most fundamental implication of MOND, beyond its implied modification of Newtonian dynamics and general relativity, and beyond the elimination of dark matter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indeed, the potential link between MONDian dynamics and the universe as a whole (that is, cosmology) is augmented by the observation that the value of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (determined by fits to internal properties of galaxies) is within an order of magnitude of ''cH''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Hubble constant]] (a measure of the present-day expansion rate of the universe).&lt;ref name = "Milgrom papers"/&gt; It is also close to the [[Accelerating universe|acceleration rate of the universe]], and hence the [[cosmological constant]]. However, as yet no full theory has been constructed which manifests these connections in a natural way.

== Responses and criticism ==

=== Attempts to explain MOND phenomenology using dark matter ===

While acknowledging that Milgrom's law provides a succinct and accurate description of a range of galactic phenomena, many physicists reject the idea that classical dynamics itself needs to be modified and attempt instead to explain the law's success by reference to the behaviour of dark matter. Some effort has gone towards establishing the presence of a characteristic acceleration scale as a natural consequence of the behaviour of cold dark matter halos,&lt;ref&gt;M. Kaplinghat and M. Turner (2002), "How Cold Dark Matter Theory Explains Milgrom's Law", {{arxiv|astro-ph/0107284}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Chan (2013), "Reconciliation of MOND and Dark Matter theory", {{arxiv|1310.6810}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Milgrom has argued that such arguments explain only a small subset of MOND [[wikt:phenomenon|phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Milgrom (2002), "Do Modified Newtonian Dynamics Follow from the Cold Dark Matter Paradigm?", {{arxiv|astro-ph/0110362}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative proposal is to modify the properties of dark matter (e.g., to make it [[strongly interacting massive particle|interact strongly]] with itself or baryons) in order to induce the tight coupling between the baryonic and dark matter mass that the observations point to.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bullock (2014), [http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events/2014/sackler/index/talks/Harvard2014_Bullock.pdf Self-Interacting Dark Matter]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, some researchers suggest that explaining the empirical success of Milgrom's law requires a more radical break with conventional assumptions about the nature of dark matter. One idea (dubbed "dipolar dark matter") is to make dark matter gravitationally [[Dipolar polarization|polarisable]] by ordinary matter and have this polarisation enhance the gravitational attraction between baryons.&lt;ref&gt;L. Blanchet, "Gravitational polarization and the phenomenology of MOND", Class. Quantum Grav., 24, 3529–3539, (2007), {{arXiv|astro-ph/0605637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outstanding problems for MOND ===

The most serious problem facing Milgrom's law is that it cannot completely eliminate the need for dark matter in all astrophysical systems: galaxy clusters show a residual mass discrepancy even when analysed using MOND.&lt;ref name = "tale of two paradigms"/&gt; The fact that some form of unseen mass must exist in these systems detracts from the elegance of MOND as a solution to the missing mass problem, although the amount of extra mass required is 5 times less than in a Newtonian analysis, and there is no requirement that the missing mass be non-baryonic. It has been speculated that 2&amp;nbsp;eV neutrinos could account for the cluster observations in MOND while preserving the theory's successes at the galaxy scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Angus |first=Garry W. |last2=Shan |first2=Huan Yuan |last3=Zhao |first3=Hong Sheng |last4=Famaey |first4=Benoit |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2007 |title=On the Proof of Dark Matter, the Law of Gravity, and the Mass of Neutrinos |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=654 |issue=1 |pages=L13–L16 |doi=10.1086/510738 |arxiv=astro-ph/0609125 |bibcode=2007ApJ...654L..13A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=R.H.

The 2006 observation of a pair of colliding galaxy clusters known as the "[[Bullet Cluster]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Clowe |first=Douglas |last2=Bradač |first2=Maruša |last3=Gonzalez |first3=Anthony H. |last4=Markevitch |first4=Maxim |last5=Randall |first5=Scott W. |last6=Jones |first6=Christine |last7=Zaritsky |first7=Dennis |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2006 |title=A Direct Empirical Proof of the Existence of Dark Matter |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=648 |issue=2 |pages=L109–L113 |doi=10.1086/508162 |arxiv=astro-ph/0608407 |bibcode=2006ApJ...648L.109C}}&lt;/ref&gt; poses a significant challenge for all theories proposing a modified gravity solution to the missing mass problem, including MOND. Astronomers measured the distribution of stellar and gas mass in the clusters using [[visible light|visible]] and [[X-ray]] light, respectively, and in addition mapped the inferred dark matter density using gravitational lensing. In MOND, one would expect the missing mass (which is only apparent since it results from using Newtonian as opposed to MONDian dynamics) to be centred on the visible mass. In ΛCDM, on the other hand, one would expect the dark matter to be significantly offset from the visible mass because the halos of the two colliding clusters would pass through each other (assuming, as is conventional, that dark matter is collisionless), whilst the cluster gas would interact and end up at the centre. An offset is clearly seen in the observations. It has been suggested, however, that MOND-based models may be able to generate such an offset in strongly non-spherically-symmetric systems, such as the Bullet Cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=G.W.

Several other studies have noted observational difficulties with MOND.

Besides these observational issues, MOND and its generalisations are plagued by theoretical difficulties.&lt;ref name = "fin du mond"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Contaldi, T. Wiseman, B. Withers (2008), "TeVeS gets caught on caustics", {{arxiv|0802.1215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several ad-hoc and inelegant additions to general relativity are required to create a theory with a non-Newtonian non-relativistic limit, the plethora of different versions of the theory offer diverging predictions in simple physical situations and thus make it difficult to test the framework conclusively, and some formulations (most prominently those based on modified inertia) have long suffered from poor compatibility with cherished physical principles such as conservation laws.

== Proposals for testing MOND ==

Several observational and experimental tests have been proposed to help distinguish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=0705.3408|title=Testing Gravity in the Outer Solar System: Results from Trans-Neptunian Objects|author=Wallin, John F.|author2=Dixon, David S.|author3=Page, Gary L.|date=23 May 2007|doi=10.1086/520528|volume=666|issue=2|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|pages=1296–1302|bibcode=2007ApJ...666.1296W}}&lt;/ref&gt; between MOND and dark matter-based models:

* The [[Dark matter#Detection|detection]] of particles suitable for constituting cosmological dark matter would strongly suggest that ΛCDM is correct and no modification to Newton's laws is required.
* MOND predicts the existence of anomalous accelerations on the Earth at particular places and times of the year. These could be detected in a precision experiment.&lt;ref&gt;A. Ignatiev (2014), "Testing MOND on Earth", {{arxiv|1408.3059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. A. De Lorenci, M. Faundez-Abans, J. P. Pereira (2010). "Testing the Newton second law in the regime of small accelerations" {{arxiv|1002.2766}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has been suggested that MOND could be tested in the Solar System using the [[LISA Pathfinder]] mission (launched in 2015). In particular, it may be possible to detect the anomalous tidal stresses predicted by MOND to exist at the Earth-Sun saddlepoint of the Newtonian gravitational potential.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Trenkel, Steve Kemble, Neil Bevis, Joao Magueijo (2010). "Testing MOND/TEVES with LISA Pathfinder" {{arxiv|1001.1303}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be possible to measure MOND corrections to the [[perihelion precession]] of the planets in the Solar System,&lt;ref&gt;L. Blanchet (2011), "Testing MOND in the Solar System", {{arxiv|1105.5815}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a purpose-built spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;V. Sahni, Y. Shtanov (2006), "APSIS - an Artificial Planetary System in Space to probe extra-dimensional gravity and MOND", {{arxiv|gr-qc/0606063}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One potential astrophysical test of MOND is to investigate whether isolated galaxies behave differently from otherwise-identical galaxies that are under the influence of a strong external field. Another is to search for non-Newtonian behaviour in the motion of [[Binary star|binary star systems]] where the stars are sufficiently separated for their accelerations to be below a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;X. Hernandez, M. A. Jimenez, and C. Allen (2012), "Wide binaries as a critical test of Classical Gravity", {{arxiv|1105.1873}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Testing modified gravity with black hole shadows - [[John Moffat (physicist)|John Moffat]] calculates that the black hole shadow should appear larger by a factor of about ten in [[John Moffat (physicist)#Modified Gravity Theory|MOG]] as compared to general relativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://backreaction.blogspot.in/2015/05/testing-modified-gravity-with-black.html|title=Testing modified gravity with black hole shadows}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Testing MOND using the redshift-dependence of radial acceleration - [[Sabine Hossenfelder]] and Tobias Mistele propose a parameter-free MOND model they call Covariant Emergent Gravity and suggest that as measurements of radial acceleration improve, various MOND models and particle dark matter might be distinguishable because MOND predicts a much smaller redshift-dependence.&lt;ref&gt;S. Hossenfelder and T. Mistele (2018), "The Redshift-Dependence of Radial Acceleration:
Modified Gravity versus Particle Dark Matter", {{arxiv|1803.08683v1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Science Bowl''' (NSB) is a [[high school]] and [[middle school]] science knowledge competition using a [[quiz bowl]] format held in the United States. A [[buzzer|buzzer system]] similar to those seen on popular television [[game show]]s is used to signal an answer. The competition has been organized and sponsored by the [[United States Department of Energy]] since its inception in 1991.

==Subject areas==
During the competition, each question has a category and the high school and middle schools have a different set of categories for their questions. The 2017 high school categories are [[Chemistry]], [[Biology]], [[Physics]], [[Mathematics]], [[Energy]], and Earth and Space Science. The 2017 middle school categories are Physical Science, Life Science, Mathematics, Energy, and Earth and Space Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 National Science Bowl Rules and Guidelines|url=http://science.energy.gov/~/media/wdts/nsb/pdf/coordinator%20resources/2015_nsb_rules.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several categories have been added, dropped, or merged throughout the years. [[Computer Science]] was dropped from the list in late 2002. Current Events was in the 2005 competition, but did not make a return. General Science was dropped for the high school competition and Astronomy was merged with Earth Science to create Earth and Space in 2011.  General Science was also dropped for the middle school competition in 2015.

==Regional competitions==
The winning team of each regional Science Bowl competition is invited to participate in the National Science Bowl all expenses paid. There are a number of regional competitions across the United States. In the early years, the exact number changed from year to year. For example, in 2006 there were 65 regionals while in 2004 there were 64 regionals, and in 2003 there were 66 regionals. As of 2018, however, there are 65 high school regionals and 48 middle school regionals. These figures include the two "super regional" sites that are permitted to send two teams to the national competition. The two super regionals are the Kansas/Missouri Regional High School Science Bowl and the Connecticut/Northeast Regional High School Science Bowl (The Northeast Regional includes Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and parts of New York).

Typically, any school that meets the eligibility requirements of the National Science Bowl competition is permitted to register for the regional competition according to its geographic location. No school may compete in multiple regionals. In addition, most regional competitions permit schools to register up to three teams. Beginning in 2017, club teams will no longer be able to compete.

==Rules==
This section is concerned with the rules of the national competition. The rules of regional competitions vary greatly. There are very few prescribed rules for regional competitions. Some regionals are run nearly identically to the national competition, while others use variations of the rules or different methods of scoring.

===General rules===
A team consists of 4 or 5 students from a single school. Only 4 students play at any one time, while the 5th is designated as the alternate. Substitutions and switching captains may occur at halftime and between rounds.

[[Image:NatlSciBowl Score.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A blank score display board from the Hypatia division at the 2007 Nationals.]]

Two teams compete against each other in each match. Each team member is given a number A1, A Captain, A2, A3, B1, B Captain, B2, B3, according to the position each student sits in. In regional competitions, each round consists of 23 questions (that is, 23 toss-ups and 23 corresponding bonuses). At the National Finals, each round consists of 25 questions. The match is over when all the toss-up questions have been read (and any bonuses related to correctly answered toss-ups), or after two halves have elapsed, whichever occurs first. The team with the most points at this time is the winner. At the regional level, all matches consist of two 8-minute halves, separated by a 2-minute break.  At the national level for middle schools, all matches consist of two 10-minute halves.  For high schools, all round robin and some double elimination matches consist of two 10-minute halves, with the final rounds consisting of two 12-minute halves to accommodate the longer visual bonus questions.

===Toss-ups===
Every match begins with a toss-up question. The moderator announces the subject of the question (see "Subject Areas" above), as well as its type (Multiple Choice or Short Answer). Once the moderator completes the reading of the question, students have 5 seconds to buzz in and give an answer. Students may buzz in at any time after the category has been read—there is no need to wait for the moderator to finish. However, there is a penalty for interrupting the moderator and giving an incorrect answer. Once a student from a team has buzzed in, that team may not buzz in again on that question. Conferring between members of a team is not allowed on toss-up questions; if conferring occurs on a question, the team is disallowed from answering that question. The rules regarding conferring are typically very strict: excessive noise, eye contact, or even noticeable shifts in position can be considered conferring, as they convey information to teammates.

An answer given by a student is ruled correct or incorrect by the moderator. On short answer questions, if the answer given differs from the official one, the moderator uses his or her judgment to make a ruling (which is subject to a challenge by the competitors). On multiple choice questions, the answer given by the student is only correct if it matches the official answer ''exactly''. Alternatively, the student may give the letter choice that corresponds to the correct answer. Although A, B, C, and D were once used as answer choice letters, W, X, Y, and Z are now favored due to a lower chance of confusion. On short answers, the answer does not have to exactly match the official answer, so any given answer that roughly means the same as the official answer is accepted.

===Bonuses===
If a student answers a toss-up question correctly, that student's team receives a bonus question. The bonus question is always in the same category as the corresponding toss-up question, though it may not always relate to the toss-up question. Since only that team has the opportunity to answer the bonus question, there is no need to buzz in to answer it. After the moderator finishes reading the question, the team has 20 seconds to answer. The timekeeper will give a 5-second warning when 5 seconds remain. Conferring between team members is permitted, but the team captain must give the team's final answer.

Visual bonuses were introduced in 2003. They are only included in the final elimination rounds. The team has 30 seconds to answer a question with the aid of a visual displayed on a 19-inch monitor (for the final matches) or on a distributed worksheet (for earlier elimination matches).

The same rules apply to the judging of responses to bonus questions as apply to responses to toss-up questions. Once the team's answer has been ruled right or wrong, the moderator proceeds to the next toss-up question.

If neither team answers the toss-up question correctly, the bonus question is not read, and the moderator proceeds to the next toss-up question.

===Scoring===
Correct responses to toss-up questions are worth 4 points each.  If a student buzzes in on a toss-up question before the moderator has completely read the question (i.e., interrupts the moderator) and responds "incorrectly", 4 points are awarded to the opposing team, and the question is re-read in its entirety so that the opposing team has an opportunity to buzz in.

A correct response on a bonus question earns 10 points, making the total possible score on a single question 18 points (4 for a correct answer, 4 penalty points, and 10 for the bonus), and a perfect score 450 points. Against a team which never buzzes in (often the better approximation), the maximum (perfect) score is 350 points. This is assuming that only the regular 25 questions have been answered. Earning more than 200 points in one game is very impressive and earning more than 300 points is extremely rare.

=== Penalties ===
There are various different types of penalties given. If a player interrupts and answers incorrectly, four penalty points are awarded to the opposing team. If a player answers without being recognized (saying his number out loud), four penalty points are also given to the other team. 

Communication among team members during a toss-up incurs no point penalty, but disqualifies that team from answering the question. However, if the team that is no longer able to answer the toss-up engages in distracting behavior, then the opposing team is awarded four points, the opportunity to answer the corresponding bonus, and the option of running 20 additional seconds off the game clock. Similarly, if the team not playing the bonus engages in distracting behavior, then the opposing team is awarded ten points and the option of running 40 additional seconds off the game clock.

===Challenges===
Challenges must be made before the moderator begins reading the next question, or 3 seconds after the last question of the half or game. The question officially begins after its subject area has been read. Only the 4 actively competing members may challenge. The fifth team member, coach, and others associated with a team may not become involved in challenges or their discussion.

Challenges may be made either to scientific content or the administration of rules. They may not be made to judgment calls by the officials, such as whether a buzz was an interrupt, whether 20 seconds have passed before beginning to answer a bonus, or whether a stall or blurt has happened. Challenges to scientific content is limited to 2 unsuccessful challenges per round. Successful challenges do not count against this limit. Challenges to rules may be made at any time.

==Competition format==
This section is concerned with the format of the national competition only. As is the case with competition rules, the competition format varies greatly among the different regional competitions.

Regionals typically use round robin, single-elimination, double-elimination, or any combination of these formats.

The national competition always consists of two stages: round-robin and double-elimination.

===Round-robin===
All competing teams are randomly arranged (each team captain randomly picks a division and position on the first day of the National Finals) into several [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] groups of eight or nine teams each. Every team plays every other team in its group once, receiving 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, or 0 points for a loss. If a team's opponent has not arrived, that team can practice instead. The rules still apply, though any win or loss is not counted. The top two teams from each group advance to the double-elimination stage.

====Tiebreaks====
In the event that two or more teams are tied for one of the top spots in a division, the result of the Division Team Challenge (DTC) is used as a tiebreak. This method is only used for high schools.

In previous rules, there were several tiebreak procedures, applied in the following order:
# The head-to-head record of all the tied teams is compared. The team(s) with the best record against the other tied teams win(s) the tiebreak.
# The team(s) with the fewest losses win(s) the tiebreak.
# The result of the Division Team Challenge (DTC) is used.  The DTC is a lab-based activity where team members worked together to solve a challenge using the materials provided. The activity varies among the divisions.

In years before that, there was no DTC, so the following procedure was used in its place:
# If more than two teams are still tied, each team is placed in a separate room and is read ten toss-up questions. Each team's score is determined by the number of questions answered correctly minus the number answered incorrectly. The team(s) with the highest score(s) win(s) the tiebreak.
# If two teams are still tied, the two teams compete head-to-head, receiving five toss-up questions at 4 points for each correct answer (no bonus questions are used). All the usual toss-up rules are in effect, including the interrupt penalty. The team with the higher score wins the tiebreak.

If a tie still existed after this procedure, it is reapplied until the tie is resolved.  These last rules are still used for the [[National Middle School Science Bowl|Middle School competition]].

To determine which middle schools that are tied in third place in each division advance to double-elimination, several procedures are used:
# Any teams tied for any of the top three positions within a division are broken. If two teams are tied, the two teams compete head-to-head, receiving five toss-up questions at 4 points for each correct answer. Interrupt, blurt, and consultation penalties are in effect. The team with the higher score wins the tiebreak. If more than two teams are tied, each team is placed in a separate room and is read ten toss-up questions. Each team's score is determined by the number of questions answered correctly minus the number answered incorrectly.  The team(s) with the highest score(s) win(s) the tiebreak.
# The six remaining third place teams in each division compete for the four remaining spots in double elimination. Each team is placed in a separate room and is read ten toss-up questions. Each team's score is determined by the number of questions answered correctly minus the number answered incorrectly.  The team(s) with the highest score(s) win(s) the tiebreak.

===Single/Double-elimination===
Approximately 16 teams advance from the round-robin (depending on the number of round robin groups). In 2004 and 2007, exactly 16 teams advanced, while in 2003 and 2002, 18 teams advanced. In 2006, the teams were seeded into a single-elimination tournament based on their preliminary round-robin results. In previous years, a team's position in the double-elimination tournament was determined by random draw; teams were not seeded in any way. The competition then proceeded (in 2006) like a typical [[single-elimination tournament]]. Seeding continued in the 2007 tournament: teams that won their pool were paired against teams that placed second in theirs. Unlike in the round-robin, a match in double-elimination cannot be tied. If a match is tied at the end of regulation, overtime periods of five toss-ups each are played until the tie is broken.

The elimination tournament produces a first-place, second-place, third-place, and fourth-place team. Except for the 2006 tournament, a [[double-elimination tournament]] format has been used, allowing a fifth place to be added. The tournament reverted to a double-elimination format for the 2007 tournament, without a fifth-place match.

==Prizes==

The top two high school teams receive trips to one of the National Parks, all-expenses paid.

The top three middle and high school teams receive a trophy, individual medals, and photographs with officials of the Department of Energy.

The top 16 middle and high schools earn a $1,000 check for their school's science departments.

Each team with the best Division Team Challenge result in their division earns a $500 check for their school's science department.

==Car competition==
For the middle school teams, the DOE also sponsors a car competition challenging competitors to construct a car capable of attaining high speeds. They are powered through alternative energy sources such as hydrogen [[fuel cell]]s and [[solar panel]]s. The winners of the car competition are awarded with $500 for their school.

==Sponsors==
Several companies and organizations sponsor the National Science Bowl competition, the most prominent being the [[United States Department of Energy]]. [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] is also a regular sponsor of the event, and has in recent years sponsored the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Car competition held at NSB, where 16 teams compete to build the fastest or most powerful [[fuel cell]]-powered miniature car. [[IBM]] and [[Bechtel Corporation|Bechtel]] also sponsor the NSB.

'''NetPrimer''' is a gratis web-based tool used for analysing [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]] used in [[PCR]] to amplify a DNA sequence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ebd.csic.es/andy/MolEcolNotes05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The software predicts the melting temperature of the primers using the [[nearest neighbor thermodynamic algorithm]]. The accurate prediction of the melting temperature (Tm) is one of the most important factors that governs the success of a PCR reaction.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition (2003) Paperback: |author1=Dieffenbach, C.W.|author2=Dveksler, G.S.|date=2003|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|isbn=9780879696542|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IbAcGxyD06MC|page=61|accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NetPrimer also analyzes the thermodynamically important [[secondary structure]]s such as [[stem loop|hairpins]], self and cross [[primer dimer|dimers]], runs and repeats.&lt;ref&gt;pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/help.html&lt;/ref&gt; These structures significantly affect the primer efficiency and therefore the success{{clarify|date=February 2017}} of a PCR reaction.

NetPrimer can be used to determine the best primer pairs for a given set of experimental conditions. The program assigns a rating to each primer analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/nwrc/publications/08pubs/piaggio081.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The rating is based on the proximity of the  thermodynamic parameters to their ideal scores.

In addition to the primer quality, its [[molecular weight]] and [[Nucleic acid quantitation|optical activity]] (both in [[nmol]]/[[A260]] &amp; [[µg]]/A260) are also presented for quantitation. Primers are analyzed for their GC% (Guanine-Cytosine content).&lt;ref&gt;http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/reprint/39/11/4119.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This important parameter determines their [[annealing (biology)|annealing]] strength.

[[File:700 lab fix.JPG|thumb|Bruker 700&amp;nbsp;MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.]]

'''Nuclear magnetic resonance''' ('''NMR''') is a [[physical phenomenon]] in which [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in a strong static [[magnetic field]] are perturbed by a weak oscillating magnetic field (in the [[near and far field|near field]] and therefore not involving [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]]&lt;ref name="Hoult1997"&gt;D. I. Hoult, B. Bhakar, "NMR Signal Reception: Virtual Photons and Coherent Spontaneous Emission", Concepts Magn. Reson. 9, 277-297, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;) and respond by producing an electromagnetic signal with a frequency characteristic of the magnetic field at the nucleus. This process occurs near [[resonance]], when the oscillation frequency matches the intrinsic frequency of the nuclei, which depends on the strength of the static magnetic field, the chemical environment, and the magnetic properties of the [[isotope]] involved; in practical applications with static magnetic fields up to ca. 20&amp;nbsp;tesla, the frequency is similar to [[VHF]] and [[UHF]] [[Television channel frequencies|television broadcasts]] (60–1000&amp;nbsp;MHz). NMR results from specific [[magnetic]] properties of certain atomic nuclei. [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] is widely used to determine the structure of organic molecules in solution and study [[molecular physics]], [[crystallography|crystal]]s as well as non-crystalline materials. NMR is also routinely used in advanced [[medical imaging]] techniques, such as in [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).

All isotopes that contain an odd number of [[protons]] and/or [[neutrons]] (see [[Isotope#Even and odd nucleon numbers|Isotope]]) have an intrinsic [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic moment of a nucleus|nuclear magnetic moment]] and [[angular momentum]], in other words a nonzero [[Spin (physics)|nuclear spin]], while all [[nuclide]]s with even numbers of both have a total spin of zero. The most commonly used nuclei are {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|1}} and {{SimpleNuclide|link|Carbon|13}}, although isotopes of many other elements (e.g. {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|2}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Lithium|6}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Boron|10}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Boron|11}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Nitrogen|14}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Nitrogen|15}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Oxygen|17}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Fluorine|19}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Sodium|23}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Silicon|29}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Phosphorus|31}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Chlorine|35}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Cadmium|113}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Xenon|129}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Platinum|195}}) have been studied by high-field NMR spectroscopy as well.

A key feature of NMR is that the [[resonance]] frequency of a particular simple substance is usually directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. It is this feature that is exploited in imaging techniques; if a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonance frequencies of the sample's nuclei depend on where in the field they are located. Since the resolution of the imaging technique depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field [[gradient]], many efforts are made to develop increased gradient field strength. 

The principle of NMR usually involves three sequential steps:
*The alignment (polarization) of the magnetic nuclear spins in an applied, constant [[magnetic field]] '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
*The perturbation of this alignment of the nuclear spins by a weak oscillating magnetic field, usually referred to as a radio-frequency (RF) pulse. The oscillation frequency required for significant perturbation is dependent upon the static magnetic field ('''B'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and the nuclei of observation.
*The detection of the NMR signal during or after the RF pulse, due to the voltage induced in a detection coil by precession of the nuclear spins around '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. After a RF pulse, precession usually occurs with the nuclei's intrinsic [[Larmor precession|Larmor frequency]] and, in itself, does not involve transitions between spin states or energy levels.&lt;ref name="Hoult1997"/&gt;

The two magnetic fields are usually chosen to be [[perpendicular]] to each other as this maximizes the NMR signal strength. The frequencies of the time-signal response by the total magnetization ('''M''') of the nuclear spins are analyzed in [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. Both use applied magnetic fields ('''B'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) of great strength, often produced by large currents in [[superconductors|superconducting coils]], in order to achieve dispersion of response frequencies and of very high homogeneity and stability in order to deliver [[spectral resolution]], the details of which are described by [[chemical shift]]s, the [[Zeeman effect]], and [[Knight shift]]s (in metals). The information provided by NMR can also be increased using [[Hyperpolarization (physics)|hyperpolarization]], and/or using two-dimensional, three-dimensional and higher-dimensional techniques.

NMR phenomena are also utilized in [[low field NMR|low-field NMR]], NMR spectroscopy and MRI in the Earth's magnetic field (referred to as [[#Earth's field NMR|Earth's field NMR]]), and in several types of [[magnetometer]]s.

==History==

Nuclear magnetic resonance was first described and measured in molecular beams by [[Isidor Rabi]] in 1938,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

Rabi at Nobelprize.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, [[Felix Bloch]] and [[Edward Mills Purcell]] expanded the technique for use on liquids and solids, for which they shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952.&lt;ref name=Filler2009b&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/npre.2009.3267.5|title=The History, Development and Impact of Computed Imaging in Neurological Diagnosis and Neurosurgery: CT, MRI, and DTI|date=2009|author=Filler, Aaron|journal=Nature Precedings}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1952/ 1952 Nobel Prize for Physics at Nobelprize.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yevgeny Zavoisky]] likely observed nuclear magnetic resonance in 1941, well before Felix Bloch and Edward Mills Purcell, but dismissed the results as not reproducible.

[[Russell H. Varian]] filed the "Method and means for correlating nuclear properties of atoms and magnetic fields", {{US patent|2561490}} on July 24, 1951. [[Varian Associates]] developed the first NMR unit called NMR HR-30 in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=From X-rays to DNA: How Engineering Drives Biology|date=2013-11-15|author=|pages=161–162|isbn=9780262019774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purcell had worked on the development of [[radar]] during World War II at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s [[Radiation Laboratory]]. His work during that project on the production and detection of [[radio frequency|radio frequency power]] and on the absorption of such RF power by matter laid the foundation for his discovery of NMR in bulk matter.

Rabi, Bloch, and Purcell observed that magnetic nuclei, like {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|1}} and {{SimpleNuclide|link|Phosphorus|31}}, could absorb RF energy when placed in a magnetic field and when the RF was of a frequency specific to the identity of the nuclei. When this absorption occurs, the nucleus is described as being ''in resonance''. Different atomic nuclei within a molecule resonate at different (radio) frequencies for the same magnetic field strength. The observation of such magnetic resonance frequencies of the nuclei present in a molecule allows any trained user to discover essential chemical and structural information about the molecule.

The development of NMR as a technique in [[analytical chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]] parallels the development of electromagnetic technology and advanced [[electronics]] and their introduction into civilian use.

==Theory of nuclear magnetic resonance==

===Nuclear spin and magnets===

All nucleons, that is [[neutrons]] and [[protons]], composing any atomic [[nucleus (atomic structure)|nucleus]], have the intrinsic quantum property of [[spin (physics)|spin]], an intrinsic angular momentum analogous to the classical angular momentum of a spinning sphere. The overall spin of the nucleus is determined by the [[spin quantum number]] ''S''. If the numbers of both the protons and neutrons in a given [[nuclide]] are even then {{nowrap|''S'' {{=}} 0}}, i.e. there is no overall spin. Then, just as electrons pair up in nondegenerate [[atomic orbital]]s, so do even numbers of protons or even numbers of neutrons (both of which are also [[Spin-½|spin &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;]] particles and hence [[fermion]]s), giving zero overall spin.

However, a proton and {{Citation needed span|text=neutron|date=October 2018|reason=neutron spin vector aligns tself opposite to the ecternal magnetic field vector}} will have lower energy when their spins are parallel, not anti-parallel. This parallel spin alignment of distinguishable particles does not violate the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. The lowering of energy for parallel spins has to do with the [[quark]] structure of these two nucleons. As a result, the spin ground state for the deuteron (the nucleus of [[deuterium]], the &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H isotope of hydrogen), which has only a proton and a neutron, corresponds to a spin value of '''1''', ''not of zero''. On the other hand, because of the Pauli exclusion principle, the [[tritium]] isotope of hydrogen must have a pair of anti-parallel spin neutrons (of total spin zero for the neutron-spin pair), plus a proton of spin {{sfrac|1|2}}. Therefore, the tritium total nuclear spin value is again {{sfrac|1|2}}, just like for the simpler, abundant hydrogen isotope, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nucleus (the ''[[proton]]''). The NMR absorption frequency for tritium is also similar to that of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H. In many other cases of ''non-radioactive'' nuclei, the overall spin is also non-zero. For example, the {{SimpleNuclide|link|Aluminium|27}} nucleus has an overall spin value {{nowrap|''S'' {{=}} {{frac|5|2}}}}.

A non-zero spin &lt;math&gt; \vec{S} &lt;/math&gt; is always associated with a non-zero magnetic dipole moment, &lt;math&gt; \vec{\mu} &lt;/math&gt;, via the relation

&lt;math&gt; \vec{\mu} = \gamma \vec{S} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''γ'' is the [[gyromagnetic ratio]]. Classically, this corresponds to the proportionality between the angular momentum and the magnetic dipole moment of a spinning charged sphere, both of which are vectors parallel to the rotation axis whose length increases proportional to the spinning frequency. It is the magnetic moment and its interaction with magnetic fields that allows the observation of NMR signal associated with transitions between nuclear spin levels during resonant RF irradiation or caused by Larmor precession of the average magnetic moment after resonant irradiation. Nuclides with even numbers of both protons and neutrons have zero [[nuclear magnetic moment|nuclear magnetic dipole moment]] and hence do not exhibit NMR signal. For instance, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Oxygen|18}} is an example of a nuclide that produces no NMR signal, whereas {{SimpleNuclide|link|Carbon|13}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Phosphorus|31}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Chlorine|35}} and {{SimpleNuclide|link|Chlorine|37}} are nuclides that do exhibit NMR spectra. The last two nuclei have spin ''S'' &gt; 1/2 and are therefore quadrupolar nuclei.

[[Electron spin resonance]] (ESR) is a related technique in which transitions between [[electron]]ic rather than nuclear spin levels are detected. The basic principles are similar but the instrumentation, data analysis, and detailed theory are significantly different. Moreover, there is a much smaller number of molecules and materials with unpaired electron spins that exhibit ESR (or [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] (EPR)) absorption than those that have NMR absorption spectra. On the other hand, ESR has much higher signal per spin than NMR does.

===Values of spin angular momentum===

Nuclear [[spin (physics)|spin]] is an intrinsic [[angular momentum]] that is quantized. This means that the magnitude of this angular momentum is quantized (i.e. ''S'' can only take on a restricted range of values), and also that the x, y, and z-components of the angular momentum are quantized, being restricted to integer or half-integer multiples of ''ħ''. The integer or half-integer quantum number associated with the spin component along the z-axis or the applied magnetic field is known as the [[magnetic quantum number]], ''m'', and can take values from +''S'' to −''S'', in integer steps. Hence for any given nucleus, there are a total of {{nowrap|2''S'' + 1}} angular momentum states.

The ''z''-component of the angular momentum vector ('''&lt;math&gt; \vec{S} &lt;/math&gt;''') is therefore {{nowrap|''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''mħ''}}, where ''ħ'' is the reduced [[Planck constant]]. The ''z''-component of the magnetic moment is simply:

:&lt;math&gt; \mu_z = \gamma S_z = \gamma m\hbar.&lt;/math&gt;

====Spin energy in a magnetic field====
[[Image:NMR splitting.gif|thumb|right|300 px||Splitting of nuclei spin energies in an external magnetic field]]
[[Image:NMR EPR.gif|thumb|right|300 px||An intuitive model. Nuclei with spin have a [[magnetic moment]]s ([[spin magnetic moment]]s). By itself, there is no energetic difference for any particular orientation of the nuclear magnet (only one energy state, on the left), but in an external magnetic field there is a high-energy state and a low-energy state depending on the relative orientation of the magnet to the external field, and in thermal equilibrium, the low-energy orientation is preferred. The average orientation of the magnetic moment will [[precession|precess]] around the field. The external field can be supplied by a large magnet and also by other nuclei in the vicinity.]]

Consider nuclei with a spin of one-half, like {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|1}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Carbon|13}} or {{SimpleNuclide|link|Fluorine|19}}. Each nucleus has two linearly independent spin states, with ''m'' = {{sfrac|1|2}} or ''m'' = −{{sfrac|1|2}} (also referred to as spin-up and spin-down, or sometimes α and β spin states, respectively) for the z-component of spin. In the absence of a magnetic field, these states are degenerate; that is, they have the same energy. Hence the number of nuclei in these two states will be essentially equal at [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|thermal equilibrium]].

If a nucleus is placed in a magnetic field, however, the two states no longer have the same energy as a result of the interaction between the nuclear magnetic dipole moment and the external magnetic field. The [[energy]] of a magnetic dipole moment '''&lt;math&gt; \vec{\mu} &lt;/math&gt;''' in a magnetic field '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt; E = -\vec{\mu} \cdot \mathbf{B}_0 = -\mu_x B_{0x}-\mu_y B_{0y}-\mu_z B_{0z} .&lt;/math&gt;

Usually the ''z''-axis is chosen to be along '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the above expression reduces to:
:&lt;math&gt; E = -\mu_\mathrm{z} B_0 \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
or alternatively:
:&lt;math&gt; E = -\gamma m\hbar B_0 \ .&lt;/math&gt;

As a result, the different nuclear spin states have different energies in a non-zero magnetic field. In less formal language, we can talk about the two spin states of a spin {{sfrac|1|2}} as being ''aligned'' either with or against the magnetic field. If ''γ'' is positive (true for most isotopes used in NMR) then {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}} is the lower energy state.

The energy difference between the two states is:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta{E} = \gamma \hbar B_0 \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

and this results in a small population bias favoring the lower energy state in thermal equilibrium. With more spins pointing up than down, a net spin magnetization along the magnetic field '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; results.

==== Precession of the spin magnetization ====
{{details|Larmor precession}}
A central concept in NMR is the precession of the spin magnetization around the magnetic field at the nucleus, with the angular frequency

&lt;math&gt; \omega = -\gamma B&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \omega = 2\pi \nu&lt;/math&gt; relates to the oscillation frequency &lt;math&gt; \nu&lt;/math&gt; and ''B'' is the magnitude of the field.&lt;ref name="CohenTan1977"&gt;C. Cohen-Tannoudji, B. Diu, F. Laloe, ''Quantum Mechanics'', Vol. 1, Wiley VCH, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the spin magnetization, which is proportional to the sum of the spin vectors of nuclei in magnetically equivalent sites (the [[expectation value]] of the spin vector in quantum mechanics), moves on a cone around the '''B''' field. This is analogous to the precessional motion of the axis of a tilted spinning top around the gravitational field. In quantum mechanics, &lt;math&gt; \omega&lt;/math&gt; is the ''Bohr frequency''&lt;ref name="CohenTan1977"/&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Delta{E}/\hbar&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt; S_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; S_y&lt;/math&gt; expectation values. Precession of non-equilibrium magnetization in the applied magnetic field '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; occurs with the Larmor frequency

&lt;math&gt; \omega_L = 2\pi \nu_L = -\gamma B_0&lt;/math&gt;,

without change in the populations of the energy levels because energy is constant (time-independent Hamiltonian).&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Feynman, R. B. Leighton, M. Sands, ''The Feynman Lectures in Physics'', Vol. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Magnetic resonance and radio-frequency pulses====
A perturbation of nuclear spin orientations from equilibrium will occur only when an oscillating magnetic field is applied whose frequency ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;rf&lt;/sub&gt; sufficiently closely matches the [[Larmor precession]] frequency ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; of the nuclear magnetization. The populations of the spin-up and -down energy levels then undergo [[Rabi cycle|Rabi oscillations]],&lt;ref name="CohenTan1977"/&gt; which are analyzed most easily in terms of precession of the spin magnetization around the effective magnetic field in a reference frame rotating with the frequency ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;rf&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Abragam1961"&gt;A. Abragam, ''The Principles of Nuclear Magnetism'', Ch. 2, Oxford Clarendon Press, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; The stronger the oscillating field, the faster the Rabi oscillations or the precession around the effective field in the rotating frame. After a certain time on the order of 2-1000 microseconds, a resonant RF pulse flips the spin magnetization to the transverse plane, i.e. it makes an angle of 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; with the constant magnetic field '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ("90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; pulse"), while after a twice longer time, the initial magnetization has been inverted ("180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; pulse"). It is the transverse magnetization generated by a resonant oscillating field which is usually detected in NMR, during application of the relatively weak RF field in old-fashioned continuous-wave NMR, or after the relatively strong RF pulse in modern pulsed NMR. 

====Chemical shielding====

It might appear from the above that all nuclei of the same nuclide (and hence the same ''γ'') would resonate at exactly the same frequency. This is not the case. The most important perturbation of the NMR frequency for applications of NMR is the "shielding" effect of the surrounding shells of electrons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nmrcentral.com/2011/08/principle-of-shielding-and-deshielding/ Principle of Shielding and Deshielding]. NMRCentral.com (August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Electrons, similar to the nucleus, are also charged and rotate with a spin to produce a magnetic field opposite to the applied magnetic field. In general, this electronic shielding reduces the magnetic field ''at the nucleus'' (which is what determines the NMR frequency). As a result, the frequency required to achieve resonance is also reduced. This shift in the NMR frequency due to the electronic molecular orbital coupling to the external magnetic field is called [[chemical shift]], and it explains why NMR is able to probe the chemical structure of molecules, which depends on the electron density distribution in the corresponding molecular orbitals. If a nucleus in a specific chemical group is shielded to a higher degree by a higher electron density of its surrounding molecular orbital, then its NMR frequency will be shifted "upfield" (that is, a lower chemical shift), whereas if it is less shielded by such surrounding electron density, then its NMR frequency will be shifted "downfield" (that is, a higher chemical shift).

Unless the local [[symmetry]] of such molecular orbitals is very high (leading to "isotropic" shift), the shielding effect will depend on the orientation of the molecule with respect to the external field ('''B'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). In [[solid-state NMR]] spectroscopy, [[magic angle spinning]] is required to average out this orientation dependence in order to obtain frequency values at the average or isotropic chemical shifts. This is unnecessary in conventional NMR investigations of molecules in solution, since rapid "molecular tumbling" averages out the [[chemical shift anisotropy]] (CSA). In this case, the "average" chemical shift (ACS) or isotropic chemical shift is often simply referred to as the chemical shift.

===Relaxation===
{{details|Relaxation (NMR)}}

[[File:Proton spin MRI.webm|thumb|Visualization of the ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; relaxation times.]]

The process of population relaxation refers to nuclear spins that return to thermodynamic equilibrium in the magnet. This process is also called [[Spin-lattice relaxation time|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], "[[Spin-lattice relaxation time|spin-lattice]]" or "longitudinal magnetic" relaxation, where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the mean time for an individual nucleus to return to its thermal equilibrium state of the spins. After the nuclear spin population has relaxed, it can be probed again, since it is in the initial, equilibrium (mixed) state.

The [[Larmor precession|precessing]] nuclei can also fall out of alignment with each other and gradually stop producing a signal. This is called [[Spin-spin relaxation time|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] or ''transverse relaxation''. Because of the difference in the actual relaxation mechanisms involved (for example, intermolecular versus intramolecular magnetic dipole-dipole interactions ), ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is usually (except in rare cases) longer than ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (that is, slower spin-lattice relaxation, for example because of smaller dipole-dipole interaction effects). In practice, the value of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* which is the actually observed decay time of the observed NMR signal, or [[free induction decay]] (to {{sfrac|1|''e''}} of the initial amplitude immediately after the resonant RF pulse), also depends on the static magnetic field inhomogeneity, which is quite significant. (There is also a smaller but significant contribution to the observed FID shortening from the RF inhomogeneity of the resonant pulse).{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} In the corresponding FT-NMR spectrum—meaning the [[Fourier transform]] of the [[free induction decay]]—the ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* time is inversely related to the width of the NMR signal in frequency units. Thus, a nucleus with a long ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; relaxation time gives rise to a very sharp NMR peak in the FT-NMR spectrum for a very homogeneous ([[Shim (magnetism)|"well-shimmed"]]) static magnetic field, whereas nuclei with shorter ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; values give rise to broad FT-NMR peaks even when the magnet is shimmed well. Both ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; depend on the rate of molecular motions as well as the gyromagnetic ratios of both the resonating and their strongly interacting, next-neighbor nuclei that are not at resonance.

A [[Spin echo|Hahn echo]] decay experiment can be used to measure the dephasing time, as shown in the animation below. The size of the echo is recorded for different spacings of the two pulses. This reveals the decoherence which is not refocused by the 180° pulse. In simple cases, an [[exponential decay]] is measured which is described by the ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; time.

==NMR spectroscopy==
{{Main|NMR spectroscopy}}

[[Image:HWB-NMR - 900MHz - 21.2 Tesla.jpg|thumb|right|300px|900&amp;nbsp;MHz, 21.2&amp;nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|T]] NMR Magnet at HWB-NMR, Birmingham, UK]]

NMR spectroscopy is one of the principal techniques used to obtain physical, chemical, electronic and structural information about [[molecule]]s due to the chemical shift of the resonance frequencies of the nuclear spins in the sample. Peak splittings due to [[spin-spin coupling|J-]] or dipolar couplings between nuclei are also useful. NMR spectroscopy can provide detailed and quantitative information on the functional groups, topology, dynamics and three-dimensional structure of molecules in solution and the solid state. Since the area under an NMR peak is usually proportional to the number of spins involved, peak integrals can be used to determine composition quantitatively. 

Structure and molecular dynamics can be studied (with or without "magic angle" spinning (MAS)) by NMR of quadrupolar nuclei (that is, with spin {{nowrap|''S'' &gt; {{sfrac|1|2}}}}) even in the presence of magnetic "[[dipole]]-dipole" interaction broadening (or simply, dipolar broadening) which is always much smaller than the quadrupolar interaction strength because it is a magnetic vs. an electric interaction effect.

Additional structural and chemical information may be obtained by performing double-quantum NMR experiments for pairs of spins or quadrupolar nuclei such as {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|2}}. Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance is one of the techniques that has been used to design quantum automata, and also build elementary [[quantum computer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/QuantumComputers.html Quantum automaton and quantum computation] (see also references therein)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vandersypen&gt;

===Continuous-wave (CW) spectroscopy===
In the first few decades of nuclear magnetic resonance, spectrometers used a technique known as [[continuous-wave]] (CW) spectroscopy, where the transverse spin magnetization generated by a weak oscillating magnetic field is recorded as a function of the oscillation frequency or static field strength ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Abragam1961"/&gt; When the oscillation frequency matches the nuclear resonance frequency, the transverse magnetization is maximized and a peak is observed in the spectrum. Although NMR spectra could be, and have been, obtained using a fixed constant magnetic field and sweeping the frequency of the oscillating magnetic field, it was more convenient to use a fixed frequency source and vary the current (and hence magnetic field) in an [[electromagnet]] to observe the resonant absorption signals. This is the origin of the counterintuitive, but still common, "high field" and "low field" terminology for low frequency and high frequency regions, respectively, of the NMR spectrum.

As of 1996, CW instruments were still used for routine work because the older instruments were cheaper to maintain and operate, often operating at 60&amp;nbsp;MHz with correspondingly weaker (non-superconducting) electromagnets cooled with water rather than liquid helium.  One radio coil operated continuously, sweeping through a range of frequencies, while another [[orthogonal]] coil, designed not to receive radiation from the transmitter, received signals from nuclei that reoriented in solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pci.tu-bs.de/aggericke/Lehre/Spektroskopie/ESR_NMR/NMR.htm|title=Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy|author=Brian M. Tissue|date=1996|publisher=Technische Universitaet Braunschweig}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2014, low-end refurbished 60&amp;nbsp;MHz and 90&amp;nbsp;MHz systems were sold as FT-NMR instruments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.process-nmr.com/NMR%20Blog%20on%20the%20Web.htm|title=2nd Annual Practical Applications of NMR in Industry Conference (PANIC) Announced|publisher=Process NMR|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=January 2017}} and in 2010 the "average workhorse" NMR instrument was configured for 300&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/10/22/the_latest_technology|title=The Latest Technology|author=Derek Lowe|date=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=January 2017}}&lt;!-- mixes ideas of magnet strength, which is usually fixed (not configurable), electronics and computational interfaces (CW vs FT is not a magnet effect), and last ref doesn't seem to relate to CW or CW-converted-to-FT --&gt;

CW spectroscopy is inefficient in comparison with [[Fourier analysis]] techniques (see below) since it probes the NMR response at individual frequencies or field strengths in succession. Since the NMR signal is intrinsically weak, the observed spectrum suffers from a poor [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. This can be mitigated by signal averaging, i.e. adding the spectra from repeated measurements. While the NMR signal is the same in each scan and so adds linearly, the [[random noise]] adds more slowly – [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]]al to the [[square root]] of the number of spectra (see [[random walk]]). Hence the overall signal-to-noise ratio increases as the square-root of the number of spectra measured.

===Fourier-transform spectroscopy===

Most applications of NMR involve full NMR spectra, that is, the intensity of the NMR signal as a function of frequency. Early attempts to acquire the NMR spectrum more efficiently than simple CW methods involved illuminating the target simultaneously with more than one frequency. A revolution in NMR occurred when short radio-frequency pulses began to be used, with a frequency centered at the middle of the NMR spectrum. In simple terms, a short pulse of a given "carrier" frequency "contains" a range of frequencies centered about the [[carrier frequency]], with the range of excitation ([[signal bandwidth|bandwidth]]) being inversely proportional to the pulse duration, i.e. the [[Fourier transform]] of a short pulse contains contributions from all the frequencies in the neighborhood of the principal frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ryogo Kubo |author2=Kazuhisa Tomita |url=http://jpsj.ipap.jp/link?JPSJ/9/888/|language=English|title=A General Theory of Magnetic Resonance Absorption |journal=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=888–919|publisher=[[Physical Society of Japan]]|date=1954|doi=10.1143/JPSJ.9.888|bibcode=1954JPSJ....9..888K}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restricted range of the NMR frequencies made it relatively easy to use short (1 - 100 microsecond) radio frequency pulses to excite the entire NMR spectrum.

Applying such a pulse to a set of nuclear spins simultaneously excites all the single-quantum NMR transitions. In terms of the net magnetization vector, this corresponds to tilting the magnetization vector away from its equilibrium position (aligned along the external magnetic field). The out-of-equilibrium magnetization vector then precesses about the external magnetic field vector at the NMR frequency of the spins. This oscillating magnetization vector [[electromagnetic induction|induces]] a voltage in a nearby pickup coil, creating an electrical signal oscillating at the NMR frequency. This signal is known as the [[free induction decay]] (FID), and it contains the sum of the NMR responses from all the excited spins. In order to obtain the frequency-domain NMR [[spectrum]] (NMR absorption intensity vs. NMR frequency) this time-domain signal (intensity vs. time) must be [[Fourier transform]]ed. Fortunately, the development of Fourier transform (FT) NMR coincided with the development of [[digital computer]]s and the digital [[Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm|Fast Fourier Transform]]. Fourier methods can be applied to many types of spectroscopy. (See the full article on [[Fourier transform spectroscopy]].)

[[Richard R. Ernst]] was one of the pioneers of pulsed NMR and won a [[Nobel Prize in chemistry]] in 1991 for his work on Fourier Transform NMR and his development of multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy.

===Multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy===

The use of pulses of different durations, frequencies, or shapes in specifically designed patterns or ''pulse sequences'' allows the NMR spectroscopist to extract many different types of information about the molecules in the sample. In multi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, there are at least two pulses and, as the experiment is repeated, the pulse timings are systematically varied and the oscillations of the spin system are probed point by point in the time domain. Multidimensional Fourier transformation of the multidimensional time signal yields the multidimensional spectrum. In two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance there will be one systematically varied time period in the sequence of pulses, which will modulate the intensity or phase of the detected signals. In 3D NMR, two time periods will be varied independently, and in 4D NMR, three will be varied. The remaining "dimension" is always provided by the directly detected signal.

There are many such experiments. In some, fixed time intervals allow (among other things) magnetization transfer between nuclei and, therefore, the detection of the kinds of nuclear-nuclear interactions that allowed for the magnetization transfer. Interactions that can be detected are usually classified into two kinds. There are ''through-bond'' and ''through-space'' interactions, the latter being a consequence of dipolar couplings in solid-state NMR and of the [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] in solution NMR. Experiments of the nuclear Overhauser variety may be employed to establish distances between atoms, as for example by [[2D-FT NMRI and Spectroscopy|2D-FT&amp;nbsp;NMR]] of molecules in solution.

Although the fundamental concept of 2D-FT&amp;nbsp;NMR was proposed by [[Jean Jeener]] from the [[Free University of Brussels]] at an international conference, this idea was largely developed by [[Richard R. Ernst|Richard Ernst]] who won the 1991 [[Nobel prize in Chemistry]] for his work in FT&amp;nbsp;NMR, including multi-dimensional FT&amp;nbsp;NMR, and especially 2D-FT&amp;nbsp;NMR of small molecules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1991/ernst-lecture.html "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Fourier Transform Spectroscopy"] Ernst's Nobel lecture. (Includes mention of Jeener's suggestion.)&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-dimensional FT&amp;nbsp;NMR experiments were then further developed into powerful methodologies for studying molecules in solution, in particular for the determination of the structure of [[biopolymer]]s such as [[protein]]s or even small [[nucleic acid]]s.&lt;ref name="2D-FT NMR and Magnetic Resonance Imaging"&gt;

In 2002 [[Kurt Wüthrich]] shared the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] (with [[John Bennett Fenn]] and [[Koichi Tanaka]]) for his work with [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|protein FT&amp;nbsp;NMR]] in solution.

===Solid-state NMR spectroscopy===
{{Main|Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance}}
This technique complements [[X-ray crystallography]] in that it is frequently applicable to molecules in an amorphous or [[liquid crystal|liquid-crystalline]] state, whereas crystallography, as the name implies, is performed on molecules in a crystalline phase. In electronically conductive materials, the [[Knight shift]] of the resonance frequency can provide information on the mobile charge carriers. Though nuclear magnetic resonance is used to study the structure of solids, extensive atomic-level structural detail is more challenging to obtain in the solid state. Due to broadening by [[chemical shift anisotropy]] (CSA) and dipolar couplings to other nuclear spins,  without special techniques such as [[magic angle spinning|MAS]] or dipolar decoupling by RF pulses, the observed spectrum is often only a broad Gaussian band for non-quadrupolar spins in a solid.

Professor Raymond Andrew at the [[University of Nottingham]] in the UK pioneered the development of high-resolution [[solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance]]. He was the first to report the introduction of the [[magic angle spinning|MAS]] (magic angle sample spinning; MASS) technique that allowed him to achieve spectral resolution in solids sufficient to distinguish between chemical groups with either different chemical shifts or distinct [[Knight shift]]s. In MASS, the sample is spun at several kilohertz around an axis that makes the so-called [[magic angle]] ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (which is ~54.74°, where 3cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''θ''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;-1 = 0) with respect to the direction of the static magnetic field '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; as a result of such magic angle sample spinning, the broad chemical shift anisotropy bands are averaged to their corresponding average (isotropic) chemical shift values. Correct alignment of the sample rotation axis as close as possible to ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is essential for cancelling out the chemical-shift anisotropy broadening. There are different angles for the sample spinning relative to the applied field for the averaging of electric quadrupole interactions and paramagnetic interactions, correspondingly ~30.6° and ~70.1°. In amorphous materials, residual line broadening remains since each segment is in a slightly different environment, therefore exhibiting a slightly different NMR frequency.

Dipolar and J-couplings to nearby &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei are usually removed by radio-frequency pulses applied at the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H frequency during signal detection. The concept of cross polarization developed by Sven Hartmann and [[Erwin Hahn]] was utilized in transferring magnetization from protons to less sensitive nuclei by M.G. Gibby, [[Alexander Pines|Alex Pines]] and [[John S. Waugh]]. Then, Jake Schaefer and Ed Stejskal demonstrated the powerful use of cross polarization under MAS conditions (CP-MAS) and proton decoupling, which is now routinely employed to measure high resolution spectra of low-abundance and low-sensitivity nuclei, such as carbon-13, silicon-29, or nitrogen-15, in solids. Significant further signal enhancement can be achieved by [[dynamic nuclear polarization]] from unpaired electrons to the nuclei, usually at temperatures near 110 K.

===Sensitivity===
Because the intensity of nuclear magnetic resonance signals and, hence, the sensitivity of the technique depends on the strength of the magnetic field the technique has also advanced over the decades with the development of more powerful magnets. Advances made in audio-visual technology have also improved the signal-generation and processing capabilities of newer instruments.

As noted above, the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance signals is also dependent on the presence of a magnetically susceptible nuclide and, therefore, either on the natural abundance of such nuclides or on the ability of the experimentalist to artificially enrich the molecules, under study, with such nuclides. The most abundant naturally occurring isotopes of hydrogen and phosphorus (for example) are both magnetically susceptible and readily useful for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In contrast, carbon and nitrogen have useful isotopes but which occur only in very low natural abundance.

Other limitations on sensitivity arise from the quantum-mechanical nature of the phenomenon. For quantum states separated by energy equivalent to radio frequencies, thermal energy from the environment causes the populations of the states to be close to equal. Since incoming radiation is equally likely to cause stimulated emission (a transition from the upper to the lower state) as absorption, the NMR effect depends on an excess of nuclei in the lower states. Several factors can reduce sensitivity, including:
*Increasing temperature, which evens out the population of states. Conversely, low temperature NMR can sometimes yield better results than room-temperature NMR, providing the sample remains liquid.
*Saturation of the sample with energy applied at the resonant radiofrequency. This manifests in both CW and pulsed NMR; in the first case (CW) this happens by using too much continuous power that keeps the upper spin levels completely populated; in the second case (pulsed), each pulse (that is at least a 90° pulse) leaves the sample saturated, and four to five times the (longitudinal) relaxation time (5''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) must pass before the next pulse or pulse sequence can be applied. For single pulse experiments, shorter RF pulses that tip the magnetization by less than 90° can be used, which loses some intensity of the signal, but allows for shorter ''recycle delays''. The optimum there is called an ''Ernst angle'', after [[Richard R. Ernst|the Nobel laureate]]. Especially in solid state NMR, or in samples containing very few nuclei with spin (diamond with the natural 1% of carbon-13 is especially troublesome here) the longitudinal relaxation times can be on the range of hours, while for proton-NMR they are more in the range of one second.
*Non-magnetic effects, such as electric-[[quadrupole]] coupling of spin-1 and spin-{{sfrac|3|2}} nuclei with their local environment, which broaden and weaken absorption peaks. {{SimpleNuclide|link|Nitrogen|14}}, an abundant spin-1 nucleus, is difficult to study for this reason. High resolution NMR instead probes molecules using the rarer {{SimpleNuclide|link|Nitrogen|15}} isotope, which has spin-{{sfrac|1|2}}.

===Isotopes===
Many isotopes of chemical elements can be used for NMR analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/nmr/techniques/1d/multi.html Multinuclear NMR]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commonly used nuclei:'''
*{{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|1}}, the most commonly used spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} nucleus in NMR investigation, has been studied using many forms of NMR. Hydrogen is highly abundant, especially in biological systems. It is the nucleus most sensitive to NMR signal (apart from {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|3}} which is not commonly used due to its instability and radioactivity). Proton NMR produces narrow chemical shift with sharp signals. Fast acquisition of quantitative results (peak integrals in stoichiometric ratio) is possible due to short relaxation time.  The {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|1}} signal has been the sole diagnostic nucleus used for clinical magnetic resonance imaging.
*{{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|2}}, a spin 1 nucleus commonly utilized as signal-free medium in the form of [[:category:deuterated solvent|deuterated solvents]] during proton NMR, to avoid signal interference from hydrogen-containing solvents in measurement of {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|1}} solutes. Also used in determining the behavior of lipids in lipid membranes and other solids or liquid crystals as it is a relatively non-perturbing label which can selectively replace {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|1}}. Alternatively, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|2}} can be detected in media specially labeled with {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|2}}. Deuterium resonance is commonly used in high-resolution [[NMR spectroscopy]] to monitor drifts in the magnetic field strength (lock) and to improve the homogeneity of the external magnetic field.
*{{SimpleNuclide|link|Helium|3}}, is very sensitive to NMR. There is a very low percentage in natural helium, and subsequently has to be purified from {{SimpleNuclide|link|Helium|4}}. It is used mainly in studies of [[endohedral fullerenes]], where its chemical inertness is beneficial to ascertaining the structure of the entrapping fullerene.
*{{SimpleNuclide|link|Boron|11}}, more sensitive than {{SimpleNuclide|link|Boron|10}}, yields sharper signals. Quartz tubes must be used as [[borosilicate]] glass interferes with measurement.
*{{SimpleNuclide|link|Carbon|13}} spin-{{sfrac|1|2}}, is widely used, despite its relative paucity in naturally occurring carbon (approximately 1.1%). It is stable to nuclear decay. Since there is a low percentage in natural carbon, spectrum acquisition on samples which have not been experimentally enriched in {{SimpleNuclide|link|Carbon|13}} takes a long time. Frequently used for labeling of compounds in synthetic and metabolic studies. Has low sensitivity and moderately wide chemical shift range, yields sharp signals. Low percentage makes it useful by preventing spin-spin couplings and makes the spectrum appear less crowded. Slow relaxation means that spectra are not integrable unless long acquisition times are used.
*{{SimpleNuclide|link|Nitrogen|14}}, spin-1, medium sensitivity nucleus with wide chemical shift. Its large [[quadrupole]] moment interferes in acquisition of high resolution spectra, limiting usefulness to smaller molecules and functional groups with a high degree of symmetry such as the headgroups of lipids.
*{{SimpleNuclide|link|Nitrogen|15}}, spin-{{sfrac|1|2}}, relatively commonly used. Can be used for labeling compounds. Nucleus very insensitive but yields sharp signals. Low percentage in natural nitrogen together with low sensitivity requires high concentrations or expensive isotope enrichment.
*{{SimpleNuclide|link|Oxygen|17}}, spin-{{sfrac|5|2}}, low sensitivity and very low natural abundance (0.037%), wide chemical shift range (up to 2000 ppm). Quadrupole moment causing line broadening. Used in metabolic and biochemical studies in studies of chemical equilibria.
*{{SimpleNuclide|link|Fluorine|19}}, spin-{{sfrac|1|2}}, relatively commonly measured. Sensitive, yields sharp signals, has a wide chemical shift range.
*{{SimpleNuclide|link|Phosphorus|31}}, spin-{{sfrac|1|2}}, 100% of natural phosphorus. Medium sensitivity, wide chemical shifts range, yields sharp lines. Spectra tend to have a moderate amount of noise. Used in biochemical studies and in coordination chemistry where phosphorus containing ligands are involved.
*{{SimpleNuclide|link|Chlorine|35}} and {{SimpleNuclide|link|Chlorine|37}}, broad signal. {{SimpleNuclide|link|Chlorine|35}} is significantly more sensitive, preferred over {{SimpleNuclide|link|Chlorine|37}} despite its slightly broader signal. Organic chlorides yield very broad signals. Its use is limited to inorganic and ionic chlorides and very small organic molecules.
*{{SimpleNuclide|link|Calcium|43}}, used in biochemistry to study calcium binding to DNA, proteins, etc. Moderately sensitive, very low natural abundance.
*{{SimpleNuclide|link|Platinum|195}}, used in studies of [[catalyst]]s and complexes.

==Applications==
NMR is extensively used in medicine in the form of [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. NMR is used industrially mainly for routine analysis of chemicals. The technique is also used, for example, to measure the ratio between water and fat in foods, monitor the flow of corrosive fluids in pipes, or to study molecular structures such as catalysts.&lt;ref name=non-medical&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magnetic-resonance.org/ch/19-01.html|title=Chapter Nineteen Non-Medical Applications of NMR and MRI|journal=Magnetic Resonance|edition=11|date=June 2017|accessdate=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
[[File:MRI-Philips.JPG|thumb|Medical MRI]]
{{See also|Magnetic resonance imaging}}
The application of nuclear magnetic resonance best known to the general public is [[magnetic resonance imaging]] for medical diagnosis and [[magnetic resonance microscopy]] in research settings. However, it is also widely used in biochemical studies, notably in NMR spectroscopy such as [[proton NMR]], [[carbon-13 NMR]], deuterium NMR and phosphorus-31 NMR. Biochemical information can also be obtained from living tissue (e.g. human [[brain]] [[tumor]]s) with the technique known as [[in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] or [[chemical shift]] NMR microscopy.

These spectroscopic studies are possible because nuclei are surrounded by orbiting electrons, which are charged particles that generate small, local magnetic fields that add to or subtract from the external magnetic field, and so will partially shield the nuclei. The amount of shielding depends on the exact local environment. For example, a hydrogen bonded to an [[oxygen]] will be shielded differently from a hydrogen bonded to a carbon atom. In addition, two hydrogen nuclei can interact via a process known as [[spin-spin coupling]], if they are on the same molecule, which will split the lines of the spectra in a recognizable way.

As one of the two major spectroscopic techniques used in [[metabolomics]], NMR is used to generate metabolic fingerprints from biological fluids to obtain information about disease states or toxic insults.

===Chemistry===

By studying the peaks of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, chemists can determine the structure of many compounds. It can be a very selective technique, distinguishing among many atoms within a molecule or collection of molecules of the same type but which differ only in terms of their local chemical environment. NMR spectroscopy is used to unambiguously identify known and novel compounds, and as such, is usually required by scientific journals for identity confirmation of synthesized new compounds. See the articles on [[carbon-13 NMR]] and [[proton NMR]] for detailed discussions.

A chemist can determine the identity of a compound by comparing the observed nuclear precession frequencies to known frequencies. Further structural data can be [[Structural elucidation|elucidated]] by observing ''[[spin-spin coupling]]'', a process by which the precession frequency of a nucleus can be influenced by the spin orientation of a chemically bonded nucleus. Spin-spin coupling is easily observed in NMR of hydrogen-1 ({{SimpleNuclide|Hydrogen|1}}&amp;nbsp;NMR) since its natural abundance is nearly 100%.

Because the nuclear magnetic resonance ''timescale'' is rather slow, compared to other spectroscopic methods, changing the temperature of a ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* experiment can also give information about fast reactions, such as the [[Cope rearrangement]] or about structural dynamics, such as ring-flipping in [[cyclohexane]]. At low enough temperatures, a distinction can be made between the axial and equatorial hydrogens in cyclohexane.

An example of nuclear magnetic resonance being used in the determination of a structure is that of [[buckminsterfullerene]] (often called "buckyballs", composition C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;). This now famous form of carbon has 60 carbon atoms forming a sphere. The carbon atoms are all in identical environments and so should see the same internal '''H''' field. Unfortunately, buckminsterfullerene contains no hydrogen and so {{SimpleNuclide|link|Carbon|13}} nuclear magnetic resonance has to be used. {{SimpleNuclide|link|Carbon|13}} spectra require longer acquisition times since carbon-13 is not the common isotope of carbon (unlike hydrogen, where {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|1}} is the common isotope). However, in 1990 the spectrum was obtained by R. Taylor and co-workers at the [[University of Sussex]] and was found to contain a single peak, confirming the unusual structure of buckminsterfullerene.&lt;ref&gt;

===Purity determination (w/w NMR)===
While NMR is primarily used for structural determination, it can also be used for purity determination, provided that the structure and [[molecular weight]] of the compound is known. This technique requires the use of an [[internal standard]] of known purity. Typically this standard will have a high molecular weight to facilitate accurate weighing, but relatively few protons so as to give a clear peak for later integration e.g. [[1,2,4,5-tetrachloro-3-nitrobenzene]]. Accurately weighed portions of the standard and sample are combined and analysed by NMR. Suitable peaks from both compounds are selected and the purity of the sample is determined via the following equation.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Purity} = \frac{w_\mathrm{std} \times n[\mathrm{H}]_\mathrm{std} \times MW_\mathrm{spl}}{w_\mathrm{spl} \times MW_\mathrm{std} \times n[\mathrm{H}]_\mathrm{spl}} \times P&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*''w''&lt;sub&gt;std&lt;/sub&gt;: weight of internal standard
*''w''&lt;sub&gt;spl&lt;/sub&gt;: weight of sample
*''n''[H]&lt;sub&gt;std&lt;/sub&gt;: the integrated area of the peak selected for comparison in the standard, corrected for the number of protons in that [[functional group]]
*''n''[H]&lt;sub&gt;spl&lt;/sub&gt;: the integrated area of the peak selected for comparison in the sample, corrected for the number of protons in that [[functional group]]
*''MW''&lt;sub&gt;std&lt;/sub&gt;: [[molecular weight]] of standard
*''MW''&lt;sub&gt;spl&lt;/sub&gt;: [[molecular weight]] of sample
*''P'': purity of internal standard

===Non-destructive testing===
Nuclear magnetic resonance is extremely useful for analyzing samples non-destructively. Radio-frequency magnetic fields easily penetrate many types of matter and anything that is not highly conductive or inherently [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]]. For example, various expensive biological samples, such as [[nucleic acids]], including [[RNA]] and [[DNA]], or [[protein]]s, can be studied using nuclear magnetic resonance for weeks or months before using destructive biochemical experiments. This also makes nuclear magnetic resonance a good choice for analyzing dangerous samples.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} 

===Segmental and molecular motions===
In addition to providing static information on molecules by determining their 3D structures, one of the remarkable advantages of NMR over [[X-ray crystallography]] is that it can be used to obtain important dynamic information. This is due to the orientation dependence of the chemical-shift, dipole-coupling, or electric-quadrupole-coupling contributions to the instantaneous NMR frequency in an anisotropic molecular environment.&lt;ref&gt;K. Schmidt-Rohr, H. W. Spiess, Multidimensional Solid-State NMR and Polymers, Ch. 2, Academic Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; When the molecule or segment containing the NMR-observed nucleus changes its orientation relative to the external field, the NMR frequency changes, which can result in changes in one- or two-dimensional spectra or in the relaxation times, depending of the correlation time and amplitude of the motion. 

===Data acquisition in the petroleum industry===
{{Main|NMR in porous media}}
Another use for nuclear magnetic resonance is [[data acquisition]] in the [[petroleum industry]] for [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] exploration and recovery. Initial research in this domain began in the 1950s, however, the first commercial instruments were not released until the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kleinberg|first=Robert L.|last2=Jackson|first2=Jasper A.|date=2001-01-01|title=An introduction to the history of NMR well logging|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cmr.1018/abstract|journal=Concepts in Magnetic Resonance|language=en|volume=13|issue=6|pages=340–342|doi=10.1002/cmr.1018|issn=1099-0534}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[borehole]] is drilled into rock and sedimentary strata into which nuclear magnetic resonance logging equipment is lowered. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of these boreholes is used to measure rock porosity, estimate permeability from pore size distribution and identify pore fluids (water, oil and gas). These instruments are typically [[low field NMR]] spectrometers.

NMR logging, a subcategory of electromagnetic logging, measures the induced magnet moment of hydrogen nuclei (protons) contained within the fluid-filled pore space of porous media (reservoir rocks). Unlike conventional logging measurements (e.g., acoustic, density, neutron, and resistivity), which respond to both the rock matrix and fluid properties and are strongly dependent on mineralogy, NMR-logging measurements respond to the presence of hydrogen. Because hydrogen atoms primarily occur in pore fluids, NMR effectively responds to the volume, composition, viscosity, and distribution of these fluids, for example oil, gas or water. NMR logs provide information about the quantities of fluids present, the properties of these fluids, and the sizes of the pores containing these fluids. From this information, it is possible to infer or estimate:

* The volume (porosity) and distribution (permeability) of the rock pore space
* Rock composition
* Type and quantity of fluid hydrocarbons
* Hydrocarbon producibility

The basic core and log measurement is the ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decay, presented as a distribution of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; amplitudes versus time at each sample depth, typically from 0.3&amp;nbsp;ms to 3&amp;nbsp;s. The ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decay is further processed to give the total pore volume (the total porosity) and pore volumes within different ranges of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The most common volumes are the bound fluid and free fluid. A permeability estimate is made using a transform such as the Timur-Coates or SDR permeability transforms. By running the log with different acquisition parameters, direct hydrocarbon typing and enhanced diffusion are possible.

===Flow probes for NMR spectroscopy===

Recently, real-time applications of NMR in liquid media have been developed using specifically designed flow probes (flow cell assemblies) which can replace standard tube probes.  This has enabled techniques that can incorporate the use of [[high performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC) or other continuous flow sample introduction devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process control===
NMR has now entered the arena of real-time [[process control]] and [[process optimization]] in [[oil refineries]] and [[petrochemical]] plants. Two different types of NMR analysis are utilized to provide real time analysis of feeds and products in order to control and optimize unit operations. Time-domain NMR (TD-NMR) spectrometers operating at low field (2–20&amp;nbsp;MHz for {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|1}}) yield [[free induction decay]] data that can be used to determine absolute [[hydrogen]] content values, [[rheological]] information, and component composition. These spectrometers are used in [[mining]], [[polymer]] production, [[cosmetics]] and food manufacturing as well as [[coal]] analysis. High resolution FT-NMR spectrometers operating in the 60&amp;nbsp;MHz range with shielded permanent magnet systems yield high resolution {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|1}} NMR spectra of [[Oil refinery|refinery]] and [[petrochemical]] streams. The variation observed in these spectra with changing physical and chemical properties is modeled using [[chemometrics]] to yield predictions on unknown samples. The prediction results are provided to [[control systems]] via analogue or digital outputs from the spectrometer.

===Earth's field NMR===
{{Main|Earth's field NMR}}
In the [[Earth's magnetic field]], NMR frequencies are in the [[audio frequency]] range, or the [[very low frequency]] and [[ultra low frequency]] bands of the [[radio frequency]] spectrum. Earth's field NMR (EFNMR) is typically stimulated by applying a relatively strong dc magnetic field pulse to the sample and, after the end of the pulse, analyzing the resulting low frequency alternating magnetic field that occurs in the Earth's magnetic field due to [[free induction decay]] (FID). These effects are exploited in some types of [[magnetometer]]s, EFNMR spectrometers, and MRI imagers. Their inexpensive portable nature makes these instruments valuable for field use and for teaching the principles of NMR and MRI.

An important feature of EFNMR spectrometry compared with high-field NMR is that some aspects of molecular structure can be observed more clearly at low fields and low frequencies, whereas other aspects observable at high fields are not observable at low fields. This is because:
* Electron-mediated heteronuclear [[J-coupling|''J''-coupling]]s ([[spin-spin coupling]]s) are field independent, producing clusters of two or more frequencies separated by several Hz, which are more easily observed in a fundamental resonance of about 2&amp;nbsp;kHz."Indeed it appears that enhanced resolution is possible due to the long spin relaxation times and high field homogeneity which prevail in EFNMR."&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~simonw/phys431/references/nmr/robinson_nmr_imaging_JMR2006.pdf | author= Robinson J. N. | display-authors= etal|date=2006|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance |volume=182 |pages=343–347 |title=Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy in Earth's magnetic field|bibcode = 2006JMagR.182..343R |doi = 10.1016/j.jmr.2006.06.027|issue=2|pmid=16860581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chemical shifts of several [[Parts per million|ppm]] are clearly separated in high field NMR spectra, but have separations of only a few millihertz at proton EFNMR frequencies, so are usually not resolved.

===Zero field NMR===
{{Main|Zero field NMR}}

In [[zero field NMR]] all magnetic fields are shielded such that magnetic fields below 1&amp;nbsp;nT (nano[[tesla (unit)|tesla]]) are achieved and the nuclear precession frequencies of all nuclei are close to zero and indistinguishable. Under those circumstances the observed spectra are no-longer dictated by chemical shifts but primarily by ''J''-coupling interactions which are independent of the external magnetic field. Since inductive detection schemes are not sensitive at very low frequencies, on the order of the ''J''-couplings (typically between 0 and 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz), alternative detection schemes are used. Specifically, sensitive [[magnetometer]]s turn out to be good detectors for zero field NMR. A zero magnetic field environment does not provide any polarization hence it is the combination of zero field NMR with hyperpolarization schemes that makes zero field NMR attractive.

===Quantum computing===
{{Main|Nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer}}
NMR quantum computing uses the [[spin (physics)|spin]] states of nuclei within molecules as [[qubit]]s. NMR differs from other implementations of quantum computers in that it uses an [[Quantum ensemble|ensemble]] of systems, in this case molecules.

===Magnetometers===
{{Main|Magnetometer}}
Various magnetometers use NMR effects to measure magnetic fields, including [[Magnetometer#Proton precession magnetometer|proton precession magnetometer]]s (PPM) (also known as [[proton magnetometer]]s), and [[Magnetometer#Overhauser magnetometer|Overhauser magnetometer]]s. See also [[Earth's field NMR]].

===SNMR===
{{Main|SNMR}}
Surface magnetic resonance (or magnetic resonance sounding) is based on the principle of Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and measurements can be used to indirectly estimate the water content of saturated and unsaturated zones in the earth's subsurface.&lt;ref&gt;Anatoly Legtchenko(2013)Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Groundwater wiley, New york city&lt;/ref&gt; SNMR is used to estimate aquifer properties, including quantity of water contained in the [[aquifer]], [[Porosity]],and [[Hydraulic conductivity]] .

{{ocean habitat topics|image=Oceanic divisions.svg|caption=The oceanic zone is the deep open ocean water that lies off the continental slopes}}

The '''oceanic zone''' is typically defined as the area of the ocean lying beyond the continental shelf, but operationally is often referred to as beginning where the water depths drop to below 200 meters (656&amp;nbsp; feet), seaward from the coast to the open ocean.

It is the region of open sea beyond the edge of the continental shelf and includes 65% of the ocean’s completely open water. The oceanic zone has a wide array of undersea terrain, including crevices that are often deeper than [[Mount Everest]] is tall, as well as deep-sea volcanoes and ocean basins. While it is often difficult for life to sustain itself in this type of environment, some species to thrive in the oceanic zone.

==Sub zones==
The oceanic zone is subdivided into the [[epipelagic]], mesopelagic, and bathypelagic zones.

The mesopelagic (disphotic) zone, where only small amounts of light penetrate, lies below the epipelagic zone. This zone is often referred to as the Twilight Zone due to its scarce amount of light. Temperatures in the mesopelagic zone range from {{convert|5|to|4|C|F}}. The pressure is higher here, it can be up to {{convert|1470|psi|Pa}} and increases with depth.&lt;ref name=NHPTV&gt;[http://www.nhptv.org/natureworks/ "NatureWorks."] New Hampshire Public Television - Engage. Connect. Celebrate. Web. 27 Oct. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

54% of the ocean lies in the bathypelagic (aphotic) zone into which no light penetrates. This is also called the midnight zone and the deep ocean. Due to the complete lack of sunlight, photosynthesis cannot occur and the only light source is bioluminescence. Water pressure is very intense and the temperatures are near freezing (range {{convert|0|to|6|C|F}}).

==Marine life==
Oceanographers have divided the ocean into zones based on how far light reaches. All of the light zones can be found in the oceanic zone. The epipelagic zone is the one closest to the surface and is the best lit. It extends to 200 meters and contains both [[phytoplankton]] and zooplankton that can support larger organisms like marine mammals and some types of fish. Past 200 meters, not enough light penetrates the water to support life, and no plant life exists.&lt;ref name=NHPTV/&gt;

There are creatures, however, which thrive around hydrothermal vents, or geysers located on the ocean floor that expel superheated water that is rich in minerals.&lt;ref&gt;The [[University of Delaware]] Marine Graduate School. [http://www.nhptv.org/natureworks/nwep6c.htm "Hydrothermal Vents."] Voyage to the Deep. The University of Delaware, 2000. Web. 27 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; These organisms feed off of chemosynthetic bacteria, which use the superheated water and chemicals from the hydrothermal vents to create energy in place of photosynthesis.  The existence of these bacteria allow creatures like squids, hatchet fish, octopuses, tube worms, giant clams, spider crabs and other organisms to survive.&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;Knight, J.D. (1997) [http://www.seasky.org Sea and Sky]  25 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the total darkness in the zones past the epipelagic zone, many organisms that survive in the deep oceans do not have eyes, and other organisms make their own light with bioluminescence. Often the light is blue-green in color, because many marine organisms are sensitive to blue light. Two chemicals, luciferin, and luciferase that react with one another to create a soft glow. The process by which bioluminescence is created is very similar to what happens when a glow stick is broken. Deep-sea organisms use bioluminescence for everything from luring prey to navigation.&lt;ref name=Knight/&gt;

Animals such as fish, whales, and sharks are found in the oceanic zone.

'''Paolo Panceri''' ([[Milan]], 1833 – [[Naples]],  1877) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Natural history|naturalist]].
Panceri graduated in [[medicine]] at the [[University of Pavia]] where he began his research. In 1861 he took
the Chair of Comparative anatomy at the [[University of Naples]], where he directed the [[Zoological Museum of Naples|Zoology Museum]].
Panceri  was cautious about the scientific validity of [[Charles Darwin|evolutionary theories]] but was instrumental in the foundation of the [[Stazione Zoologica]] Anton Dohrn (Dohrn was a Darwinian).His findings on the [[bioluminescence]] of marine invertebrates and  studies of ''[[Amphioxus]]'' led to fame in Italy and abroad. In 1874 he sold his books and scientific papers to Biblioteca Universitaria di Napoli to pay for an expedition to [[Egypt]]. They constitute an example of a nineteenth-century library specializing in the natural sciences and comparative anatomy.
His students in Naples include [[Carlo Emery]], [[Leopoldo Maggi]] and [[Antonio della Valle]].He died aged 44.

{{More footnotes|date=February 2010}}
'''Planetary engineering''' is the application of [[technology]] for the purpose of influencing the global environments of a [[planet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Martyn J. Fogg| last=Fogg| first=Martyn J.| year=1995| title=Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments| publisher=SAE International| location=Warrendale, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its objectives usually involve increasing the [[Planetary habitability|habitability of other worlds]] or mitigating [[Holocene extinction|decreases in habitability]] to [[Earth]].

Perhaps the best-known type of planetary [[engineering]] is [[terraforming]], by which a planet's surface conditions are altered to be more like those of Earth. Planetary engineering is largely the realm of [[science fiction]] at present, although recent [[climate change]] on Earth shows that [[human]] technology can cause change on a global scale.

==Terraforming==
{{Main|Terraforming}}
Terraforming is the hypothetical process of deliberately modifying the atmosphere, [[temperature]], or environment of a planet, [[moon]], or other body to be similar to those of Earth in order to make it habitable by humans.

==Seeding==
Seeding is a term used for the process of introducing microbial or algae species on a planet or moon already offering habitable regions. Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] is a good example as it has a well protected ocean under a thick ice crust. Living on the surface of the ice crust is not possible, but some microorganisms from Earth could possibly survive in the oxygen rich environment of Europa's subsurface ocean. In the case of Europa it might be possible to incrementally seed with the species in their trophic (see foodchain) context and to build up an aquatic [[ecosystem]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Geoengineering==
{{Main|Climate engineering}}
Geoengineering is the application of planetary engineering techniques to Earth. Recent geoengineering proposals have principally been methods to tackle human-induced [[climate change]] by either removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (e.g. using [[ocean iron fertilization]]) or by managing solar radiation (e.g. by using mirrors in space) in order to negate the net warming effect of climate change.&lt;ref name = royal_society&gt;{{cite book

==Habitability maintenance==

Planetary engineering can also be applied to keep habitability of Earth in the far future. The rate of weathering of silicate minerals will increase as rising temperatures speed up chemical processes. This in turn will decrease the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as these weathering processes convert carbon dioxide gas into solid carbonates. Within the next 600 million years from the present, the concentration of CO2 will fall below the critical threshold needed to sustain C3 photosynthesis: about 50 parts per million. At this point, trees and forests in their current forms will no longer be able to survive. Unlike other animal species, humankind has the potential ability to prolong the habitability of the planet Earth by extracting and re-injecting inert carbon trapped underground back into the biosphere.

More generally, the principle means that a component of a system should behave in a way that most users will expect it to behave; the behavior should not astonish or surprise users.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Formulation==
A [[textbook]] formulation is: "People are part of the system. The design should match the user's experience, expectations, and [[mental model]]s."&lt;ref name="SaltzerKaashoek2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saltzer|first1=J. H.|last2=Kaashoek|first2=Frans|authorlink2 =  Frans Kaashoek | title=Principles of computer system design: an introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-NOcVMGWSUC&amp;pg=PA85|year=2009|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-12-374957-4|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of "least surprising" behavior can depend on the expected [[audience]] (for example, [[end user]]s, [[programmer]]s, or [[System Administrators Day|system administrators]]).&lt;ref name="Raymond2004" /&gt;

In more practical terms, the principle aims to leverage the pre-existing knowledge of users to minimize the [[learning curve]], for instance by designing interfaces that borrow heavily from "functionally similar or analogous programs with which your users are likely to be familiar".&lt;ref name="Raymond2004" /&gt; User expectations in this respect may be closely related to a particular [[computing platform]] or [[tradition]]. For example, [[Unix]] command line programs are expected to follow certain conventions with respect to [[Switch (command line)|switches]],&lt;ref name="Raymond2004" /&gt; and [[GUI widget|widget]]s of [[Microsoft Windows]] programs are expected to follow certain conventions with respect to [[keyboard shortcut]]s.&lt;ref name="Petroutsos2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Petroutsos|first=Evangelos|title=Mastering Microsoft Visual Basic 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7LZTSVKZDoC&amp;pg=PA133|year=2010|publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-53287-4|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more abstract settings like an [[Application programming interface|API]], the expectation that [[Function (computer science)|function]] or method names intuitively match their behavior is another example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1176622 |chapter=How to design a good API and why it matters |last=Bloch|first=Joshua |authorlink=Joshua Bloch |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |year=2006 |pages=506–7  |doi=10.1145/1176617.1176622 |isbn=1-59593-491-X  |title=Proceeding OOPSLA '06 Companion to the 21st ACM SIGPLAN symposium on Object-oriented programming systems, languages, and applications }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice also involves the application of sensible [[default (computer science)|default]]s.&lt;ref name="rexx" /&gt;

When two elements of an interface conflict, or are ambiguous, the behavior should be that which will least surprise the [[User (computing)|user]]; in particular a [[programmer]] should try to think of the behavior that will least surprise someone who uses the program, rather than that behavior that is natural from knowing the inner workings of the program.&lt;ref name="rexx"&gt;{{cite journal

|quote=Could there be a high astonishment factor associated with the new feature? If a feature is accidentally misapplied by the user and causes what appears to him to be an unpredictable result, that feature has a high astonishment factor and is therefore undesirable.

|doi=10.1147/sj.234.0326|authorlink=Mike Cowlishaw|accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
A web site could declare an [[Form (HTML)|input]] that should autofocus when the page is loaded,&lt;ref name="Forms in HTML"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Forms_in_HTML#The_autofocus_attribute | title=Forms in HTML | publisher=Mozilla | work=Mozilla Developers Network | accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a search field (e.g., [[Google.com]]), or the ''username'' field of a [[login]] [[Form (HTML)|form]].  Sites offering [[keyboard shortcut]]s often allow pressing {{Key press|?}} to see the available shortcuts.  Examples include [[Gmail]]&lt;ref name="Gmail Keyboard Shortcuts"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594 | title=Keyboard shortcuts for Gmail | author=Vivian | publisher=Google | date=2013-06-21 | accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jira (software)|Jira]].&lt;ref name="Jira Using Keyboard Shortcuts"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Using+Keyboard+Shortcuts#UsingKeyboardShortcuts-AccessingtheKeyboardShortcutsDialogBox | title=Using Keyboard Shortcuts | publisher=Atlassian | accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{keypress|F1}} [[Function key]] in [[Windows operating system]]s is almost always for opening a help program associated with an application, and similarly for some of the Linux [[desktop environment]]s.  The corresponding key combination in [[Mac OS X]] is {{keypress|Command|Shift|/}}. Users expect a help screen or similar help services [[Context menu|popup]] when they press this key. Software binding this key to some other feature is likely to cause astonishment if no help appears. [[Malware|Malicious programs]] are known to exploit users' familiarity with regular shortcut keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9164038/Microsoft_Don_t_press_F1_key_in_Windows_XP |title=Microsoft: Don't press F1 key in Windows XP |newspaper=Computerworld |first=G. |last=Keizer |date=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In programming, a good example of this principle is the common &lt;code&gt;ParseInteger(string, radix)&lt;/code&gt; function which exists in most languages and is used to convert a [[String (computer science)|string]] to an integer value. The [[radix]] is usually an optional argument and assumed to be 10 (representing [[Decimal|base 10]]). Other bases are usually supported (like [[Binary number|binary]] or [[octal]]) but only when specified explicitly; when the radix argument is not specified, base 10 is assumed. Notably JavaScript did not originally adopt this behavior, which resulted in developer confusion and software bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5600366/why-does-the-radix-for-javascripts-parseint-default-to-8 |title=Why does the radix for JavaScript's parseInt default to 8? |date=8 April 2011 |work=Stack Overflow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3242">In [[applied mathematics]], the '''pseudospectral knotting method''' is a generalization and enhancement of a standard [[pseudospectral optimal control|pseudospectral method for optimal control]]. The concept was introduced by [[I. Michael Ross]] and [[Fariba Fahroo|F. Fahroo]]&lt;ref name="RF1"&gt;Ross, I. M. and Fahroo, F., Pseudospectral Knotting Methods for Solving Optimal Control Problems, ''Journal of Guidance, Control and Dynamics,'' Vol. 27, No. 3, pp. 397–405, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004, and forms part of the collection of the [[Ross–Fahroo pseudospectral method]]s.

==Definition==
According to Ross and Fahroo a pseudospectral (PS) knot is a double Lobatto point;&lt;ref name="RF1" /&gt; i.e. two boundary points on top of one another.  At this point, information (such as discontinuities, jumps, dimension changes etc.) is exchanged between two standard PS methods.  This information exchange is used to solve some of the most difficult problems in [[optimal control]] known as hybrid optimal control problems.&lt;ref name="RD1"&gt;Ross, I. M. and D’Souza, C. N., A Hybrid Optimal Control Framework for Mission Planning, ''Journal of Guidance, Control and Dynamics,'' Vol. 28, No. 4, July–August 2005, pp. 686–697.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a hybrid optimal control problem, an optimal control problem is intertwined with a [[graph theory|graph problem]]. A standard [[pseudospectral optimal control]] method is incapable of solving such problems; however, through the use of pseudospectral knots, the information of the graph can be encoded at the double Lobatto points thereby allowing a hybrid optimal control problem to be discretized and solved using powerful software such as [[DIDO (optimal control)|DIDO]].

==Applications==
PS knots have found applications in aerospace problems such as the ascent guidance of a launch vehicles, and advancing the Aldrin Cycler through the use of solar sails.&lt;ref name="SR1"&gt;Stevens, R. and Ross, I. M., Preliminary Design of Earth–Mars Cyclers Using Solar Sails, ''Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets,'' Vol. 41, No. 4, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;ref name="SRM"&gt; Stevens, R., Ross, I. M. and Matousek, S. E., "Earth-Mars Return Trajectories Using Solar Sails," 55th International Astronautical Congress, Vancouver, Canada, IAC-04-A.2.08, October 4–8, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
PS knots have also been used for anti-aliasing of PS optimal control solutions and for capturing critical information in switches in solving bang-bang-type [[optimal control]] problems.&lt;ref name="GFR1"&gt;Gong, Q., Fahroo, F. and Ross, I. M., A Spectral Algorithm for Pseudospectral Methods in Optimal Control, ''Journal of Guidance, Control and Dynamics,'' Vol. 31, No. 3, pp. 460–471, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
The PS knotting method was first implemented in the [https://www.mathworks.com/products/connections/product_detail/product_61633.html MATLAB optimal control] software package, [[DIDO (optimal control)|DIDO]].

Various researchers have undertaken efforts to examine the '''psychological effects of Internet use'''. Some research employs studying [[brain function]]s in [[Internet]] users. Some studies assert that these changes are harmful, while others argue that asserted changes are beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/neuronculture/2010/06/17/carr-pinker-the-shallows-and-t-1/ |title=Carr, Pinker, the shallows, and the nature-nurture canard : Neuron Culture |publisher=Scienceblogs.com |date= |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assertions==
American writer [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] asserts that Internet use reduces the deep [[thinking]] that leads to true [[creativity]]. He also says that [[hyperlink]]s and [[overstimulation]] means that the brain must give most of its attention to short-term decisions. Carr also states that the [[Information overload|vast availability of information]] on the [[World Wide Web]] overwhelms the brain and hurts [[long-term memory]]. He says that the availability of stimuli leads to a very large [[cognitive load]], which makes it difficult to remember anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/all/1 |title=Author Nicholas Carr: The Web Shatters Focus, Rewires Brains &amp;#124; Magazine |publisher=Wired.com |date=2010-05-24 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16423330 |title=The effects of the Internet: Fast forward |publisher=The Economist |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer scientist [[Ramesh Sitaraman]] has asserted that Internet users are impatient and are likely to get more impatient with time.&lt;ref name= "NPR"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/10/168974423/in-video-streaming-rat-race-fast-is-never-fast-enough/| title =NPR Morning Edition: In Video-Streaming Rat Race, Fast is Never Fast Enough, October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a large-scale research study&lt;ref name="people.cs.umass.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "sciencedaily"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/11/121113134805.htm| title = Science Daily: How Online Video Stream Quality Affect Viewer Behavior, November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that completed in 2012 involving millions of users watching videos on the Internet, Krishnan and Sitaraman show that users start to abandon online videos if they do not start playing within two seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/12/tech/web/video-loading-study/| title =CNN: Online viewers ditch slow-loading video after 2 seconds, November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition,  users with faster Internet connections (such as [[FTTH]]) showed less patience and abandoned videos at a faster rate than users with slower Internet connections. Many commentators have since argued that these results provide a glimpse into the future: as  Internet services become faster and provide more instant gratification,  people become less patient&lt;ref name="nickcarr"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.roughtype.com/?p=2069 | title= Patience is a Network Effect, by Nicholas Carr, Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;[http://edge.org/response-detail/23721 The Patience Deficit], by Nicholas Carr, Dec 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and less able to delay gratification and work towards longer-term rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2013/02/01/the-growing-culture-impatience-where-instant-gratification-makes-crave-more-instant-gratification/q8tWDNGeJB2mm45fQxtTQP/story.html?s_campaign=8315| title =Boston Globe: Instant gratification is making us perpetually impatient, Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], however, argues that people have control over what they do, and that research and reasoning never came naturally to people. He says that "experience does not revamp the basic information-processing capacities of the brain" and asserts that  the Internet is actually making people smarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/opinion/11Pinker.html?scp=1&amp;sq=mind%20over%20mass%20media&amp;st=cse |title=Mind Over Mass Media |publisher=The New York Times |date=2010-06-10|accessdate=4 July 2010 | first=Steven | last=Pinker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MRI studies==
The BBC describes the research published in the peer-reviewed science journal ''[[PLoS ONE]]'':

:"A research team led by Hao Lei of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan carried out brain scans of 35 men and women aged between 14 and 21. Seventeen of them were classed as having [[Internet addiction disorder]] (IAD) on the basis of answering yes to questions such as, “Have you repeatedly made unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back or stop Internet use?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16505521 |title=Web addicts have brain changes, research suggests |author=Helen Briggs |work=BBC News |date=11 January 2012 |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialised [[MRI brain scan]]s showed changes in the [[white matter]] of the brain—the part that contains nerve fibres—in those classed as being web addicts, compared with non-addicts. Furthermore, the study says, "We provided evidences demonstrating the multiple structural changes of the brain in IAD subjects. VBM results indicated the decreased gray matter volume in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the supplementary motor area (SMA), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the cerebellum and the left rostral ACC (rACC)."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0020708 |title=Microstructure Abnormalities in Adolescents with Internet Addiction Disorder  |vauthors=Yuan K, Qin W, Wang G, Zeng F, Zhao L, etal |work=PLoS ONE |volume= 6|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0020708 |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=17 March 2013 |pmid=21677775 |pmc=3108989 |page=e20708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCLA professor of psychiatry Gary Small studied brain activity in experienced web surfers versus casual web surfers. He used MRI scans on both groups to evaluate brain activity.  The study showed that when Internet surfing, the  brain activity of the experienced Internet users  was far more extensive than that of the novices, particularly in areas of the prefrontal cortex associated with problem-solving and decision making. However, the two groups had no significant differences in brain activity when reading blocks of text.  This  evidence suggested that the distinctive neural pathways of experienced Web users had developed because of their Web use. Dr. Small concluded that “The current explosion of digital technology not only is changing the way we live and communicate, but is rapidly and profoundly altering our brains.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/all/1 |title=The Web Shatters Focus, Rewires Brains |author=Nicholas Carr |work=Wired Magazine |date=24 May 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on traditional reading===
In an August 2008 article in ''The Atlantic'' ("[[Is Google Making Us Stupid?]]"), Nicholas Carr experientially asserts that using the Internet can lead to lower [[attention span]] and make it more difficult to read in the traditional sense (that is, read a book at length without mental interruptions). He says that he and his friends have found it more difficult to concentrate and read whole books, even though they read a great deal when they were younger (that is, when they did not have access to the Internet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/ |title=Is Google Making Us Stupid? |author=Nicholas Carr |work=The Atlantic |date=1 July 2008 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This assertion is based on anecdotal evidence, not controlled research.

Researchers from the University College London have done a 5-year study on Internet habits, and have found that people using the sites exhibited “a form of skimming activity,” hopping from one source to another and rarely returning to any source they’d already visited. The 2008 report says, "It is clear that users are not reading online in the traditional sense; indeed there are signs that new forms of “reading” are emerging as users “power browse” horizontally through titles, contents pages and abstracts going for quick wins. It almost seems that they go online to avoid reading in the traditional sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1108/00012530810887953 | volume=60 | title=The Google generation: the information behaviour of the researcher of the future | year=2008 | journal=Aslib Proceedings | pages=290–310 | author=Rowlands Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brain power==
Research suggests that using the Internet helps boost brain power for middle-aged and older people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/6395627/Internet-use-may-improve-brain-function-in-adults-says-UCLA-study.html | work=The Telegraph UK | title=Internet use 'may improve brain function in adults', says UCLA study | first=Tom |last=Chivers | date=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (research on younger people has not been done). The study compares brain activity when the subjects were reading and when the subjects were surfing the Internet. It found that Internet surfing uses much more brain activity than reading does. Lead researcher Professor Gary Small said: "The study results are encouraging, that emerging computerized technologies may have physiological effects and potential benefits for middle-aged and older adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailychump.org/internet-use-increases-brain-activity-in-seniors/ | work=DailyChump | title=Internet Use Increases Brain Activity in Seniors | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet searching engages complicated brain activity, which may help exercise and improve brain function."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7667610.stm | work=BBC News | title=Internet use 'good for the brain' | date=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productivity==
One of the most widely debated effects of [[social networking]] has been its influence on productivity. In many schools and workplaces, social media sites are blocked because employers believe their employees will be distracted and unfocused on the sites. It seems, at least from one study, that employers do, indeed, have reason to be concerned. A survey from [[Hearst Communications]] found that productivity levels of people that used social networking sites were 1.5% lower than those that did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jung|first=Brian|title=The Negative Effect of Social Media on Society and Individuals|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/negative-effect-social-media-society-individuals-27617.html|work=Chron|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc.|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Logically, people cannot get work done when they are performing other tasks. If the employees suffer from degrading self-control, it will be even harder for them to get back to work and maintain productivity.

==Effects of social networking and behavior==
[[Evgeny Morozov]] has said that social networking could be potentially harmful to people. He writes that they can destroy privacy, and notes that "Insurance companies have accessed their patients’ Facebook accounts to try to disprove they have hard-to-verify health problems like depression; employers have checked social networking sites to vet future employees; university authorities have searched the web for photos of their students’ drinking or smoking [[cannabis (drug)|pot]]." He also said that the Internet also makes people more complacent and risk averse. He said that because much of the ubiquity of modern technology—cameras, recorders, and such—people may not want to act in unusual ways for fear of getting a bad name. People can see pictures and videos of you on the Internet, and this may make you act differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/06/losing-our-minds-to-the-web/ |title=Losing our minds to the web |publisher=Prospect Magazine |date=2010-06-22 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attention span==
According to the [[New York Times]], many scientists say that "people's ability to focus is being undermined by bursts of information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/technology/07brain.html?ref=matt_richtel&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Attached to Technology and Paying a Price | first=Matt | last=Richtel | date=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 53,573 page views taken from various users, 17% of the views lasted less than 4 seconds while 4% lasted more than 10 minutes. In regards to page content, users will only read 49% of a site that contains 111 words or fewer while users will opt to read 28% of an average website (approximately 593 words). For each additional 100 words on a site, users will spend 4.4 seconds longer on the site.&lt;ref name="Attention Span Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Attention Span Statistics|url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/attention-span-statistics/|work=Statistic Brain|publisher=The Associated Press|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is found that those who read articles online go through the article more thoroughly than those who read from print-based materials. Upon choosing their reading material, online readers read 77% of the content, which can be compared to broadsheet newspaper where the corresponding number is 62%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldsmith|first=Belinda|title=Web news readers have greater attention span: study|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/03/31/us-internet-attention-idUSL292443320070331|work=Reuters|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=31 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of anonymity ==

{{See also|Internet anonymity|Anonymous post}}

Interacting on the Internet mostly does not involve "physical" interactions with another person (i.e. face-to-face conversation), and therefore easily leads to a person feeling free to act differently online, as well as unrestraint in [[civility]] and minimization of authority, etc.

People who are [[Social anxiety|socially anxious]] are more likely to use electronic communication as their only means of communication. This, in turn, makes them more likely to disclose personal information to strangers online that they normally wouldn't give out face-to-face.&lt;ref&gt;Cyberbullying: Bullying in the Digital Age&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is a likely cause for the prevalence of [[cyberbullying]], especially for children who do not understand "social networking etiquette."

Internet anonymity can lead to [[Online disinhibition effect|online disinhibition]], in which people do and say things online that they normally wouldn't do or say in person.  Psychology researcher [[John Suler]] differentiates between ''benign disinhibition'' in which people can grow psychologically by revealing secret emotions, fears, and wishes and showing  unusual acts of kindness and generosity and ''toxic disinhibition'', in which people use rude language, harsh criticisms, anger, hatred and threats or visit pornographic or violent sites that they wouldn't in the 'real world.'  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1089/1094931041291295 | volume=7 | title=The Online Disinhibition Effect | year=2004 | journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior | pages=321–326 | author=Suler John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet addiction ==

{{Main|Internet addiction disorder|}}

People become [[Internet addiction disorder|addicted]] or dependent on the Internet through excessive computer use that interferes with daily life.  [[Kimberly Young|Kimberly S. Young]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Young K | year = 1998 | title = The relationship between depression and internet addiction | url = | journal = CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 25–28 | doi=10.1089/cpb.1998.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  links internet addiction disorder with existing mental health issues, most commonly depression. Young states that the disorder has significant effects socially, psychologically and occupationally.

"Aric Sigman’s presentation to members of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health outlined the parallels between screen dependency and alcohol and drug addiction: the instant stimulation provided by all those flickering graphics leads to the release of [[dopamine]], a chemical that’s central to the brain’s reward system".&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

A 2009 study suggested that brain structural changes were present in those classified by the researchers as Internet addicted, similar to those classified as chemically addicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Zhou Y, etal | year = 2009 | title = Gray matter abnormalities in Internet addiction: A voxel-based morphometry study | url = | journal = European Journal of Radiology | volume = 79| issue = | pages = 92–95| doi = 10.1016/j.ejrad.2009.10.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, the researchers selected seventeen subjects with online gaming addiction and another seventeen naive internet users who rarely used the internet. Using a magnetic resonance imaging scanner, they performed a scan to "acquire 3-dimensional T1-weighted images" of the subject's brain. The results of the scan revealed that online gaming addiction "impairs gray and white matter integrity in the orbitofrontal cortex of the prefrontal regions of the brain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weng|first1=Chuan-Bu|title=Gray matter and white matter abnormalities in online game addiction|date=2013|pmid=23328472|volume=92|journal=Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi|pages=3221–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Keath Low, psychotherapist, the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] "has a major impact on our ability to perform such tasks as planning, prioritizing, paying attention to and remembering details, and controlling our attention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Low|first1=Keath|title=Executive functions and ADD - ADHD. What are executive functions? How do executive functions relate to ADD - ADHD?|url=http://add.about.com/od/adhdthebasics/a/Execu-Functions.htm|website=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Keith Low believes that these online gaming addicts are incapable of prioritizing their life or setting a goal and accomplishing it because of the impairment of their orbitofrontal cortex.

==Escapism ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2012}}
{{Main|Escapism}}

Ease of access to the Internet can increase [[escapism]] in which a user uses the Internet as an "escape" from the perceived unpleasant or banal aspects of daily/[[real life]]. Because the internet and virtual realities easily satisfy social needs and drives, according to Jim Blascovich and Jeremy Bailensen, "sometimes [they are] so satisfying that addicted users will withdraw physically from society.”  Stanford psychiatrist Dr. Elias Aboujaoude believes that advances in virtual reality and  immersive 3-D have led us to  “where we can have a ‘full life’ [online] that can be quite removed from our own.” Eventually, virtual reality may drastically change a person’s social and emotional needs.  “We may stop ‘needing’ or craving real social interactions because they may become foreign to us,” Aboujaoude says.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/02/the-good-and-the-bad-of-escaping-to-virtual-reality/385134/ Monica Kim, "The Good and the Bad of Escaping to Virtual Reality", ''The Atlantic'', February 20, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on children==
{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}
[[Internet]] has its impact on all age groups from elders to children. According to the article 'Digital power: exploring the effects of social media on children’s spirituality', children consider the Internet as their third place after home and school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Digital power: exploring the effects of social media on children’s spirituality | doi=10.1080/1364436X.2014.924908 | volume=19 | journal=International Journal of Children's Spirituality | pages=133–143 | year=2014 | author=Yust Karen-Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main effects social media has had on children is the effect of cyber bullying. A study carried out by 177 students in Canada found that “15% of the students admitted that they cyberbullied others” while “40% of the cyber victims had no idea who the bullies were”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Q|year=2010|title=cyberbullying in high schools: A Study of student behaviours and beliefs about this new phenomenon|url=|journal=journal of aggression, Maltreatment and trauma|volume=|pages=372–392|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological harm cyber bullying can cause is reflected in low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. It also opens up avenues for manipulation and control.  Cyber bullying has ultimately led to depression, anxiety and in severe cases suicide. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for youth between the ages of 10 and 24. Cyber bullying is rapidly increasing. Some writers have suggested monitoring and educating children from a young age about the risks associated with cyber bullying. {{Cite: Adams Richar,2015, [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/16/bullying-at-school-in-decline-but-cyberbullying-is-on-the-increase 'Fewer school bullies but cyberbullying is on the increase']}}  Not only does cyberbullying effect children but a huge issue is insomnia. This is because of the amount of time spent using the internet. children use on average 27 hours of internet a week and it is on the increase. {{ cite: Jerald J. Block, M.D.2008

== Effects on parenting ==
"A psychologist, Aric Sigman, warned of the perils of “passive [[parenting]]” and “benign [[neglect]]” caused by parent's reliance on gadgets".&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web|title=How technology is taking hold of our children's lives|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9282582/How-technology-is-taking-hold-of-our-childrens-lives.html|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=26 May 2012|author=Rowan Pelling|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, parents' internet addictions can have drastic effects on their children.   In 2009, a three-year-old girl from New Mexico died of malnutrition and dehydration on the same day that her mother was said to have spent 15 hours playing World of Warcraft online.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; In another case in 2014, a Korean couple became so immersed in a video game that allowed them to raise a virtual child online that they let their real baby die.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2014/08/15/korean-couple-let-baby-die-while-they-played-video-game-261483.html Sean Elder, "Korean Couple Let Baby Die While They Played Video Game", ''Newsweek'', August 14, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
The effects of the Internet on parenting can be observed a how parents utilize the Internet, the response to their child's Internet consumption, as well as the effects and influences that the Internet has on the relationship between parent and child.

===Parental Internet use and opinions towards family impact===
Overall, parents are seen to do simple tasks such as sending e-mails and keep up with current events whereas social networking sites are less frequented. In regards to researching parental material, a study conducted in January 2012 by the [[University of Minnesota]] found that 75% of questioned parents have stated that the Internet improves their method of obtaining parenting related information, 19.7% found parenting websites too complex to navigate, and 13.1% of the group did not find any useful parenting information on any website.&lt;ref name=parenting_20&gt;{{cite web|title=Parents' Use of Technology and the Internet|url=http://www.cehd.umn.edu/fsos/projects/parent20/pdf/p20summaryreport-july2012.pdf|publisher=University of Minnesota|author=Jessie Connell|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have shown that parents view the Internet as a hub of information especially in their children's education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mesch|first=Gustavo|title=Family Relations and the Internet: Exploring a Family Boundaries Approach|journal=The Journal of Family Communication|year=2007|pages=119–138|url=http://hevra.haifa.ac.il/~soc/lecturers/gustavo/files/1436.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They feel that it is a valuable commodity that can enhance their learning experience and when used in this manner it does not contribute to any family tension or conflicts. However, when the Internet is used as a social medium (either online gaming or social networking sites) there is a positive correlation between the use of the Internet and family conflicts. In conjunction with using the Internet for social means, there is a risk of exposing familial information to strangers, which is perceived to parents as a threat and can ultimately weaken family boundaries.

===Parental response to child #nline consumption===
A report released in October 2012 by [[Ofcom]] focused on the amount of online consumption done by children aged 5–15 and how the parents react to their child’s consumption. Of the parents interviewed, 85% use a form of online mediation ranging from face-to-face talks with their children about online surfing to cellphone browser filters. The remaining 15% of parents do not take active measures to adequately inform their children of safe Internet browsing; these parents have either spoken only briefly to their children about cautious surfing or do not do anything at all.

Parents are active in monitoring their child’s online use by using methods such as investigating the browsing history and by regulating Internet usage. However, since parents are less versed in Internet usage than their children they are more concerned with the Internet interfering with family life than online matters such as [[child grooming]] or [[cyber-bullying]].

When addressing those with lack of parental control over the Internet, parents state that their child is rarely alone (defined for children from 5–11 years old) or that they trust their children when they are online (for children 12–15 years old). Approximately 80% of parents ensure that their child has been taught Internet safety from school and 70% of parents feel that the benefits of using the Internet are greater than the risks that come along with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children and Parents: Media Use and Attitudes Report|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/media-literacy/oct2012/main.pdf|work=Ofcom|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely an American study, conducted by PewInternet released on November 20, 2012, reveal that parents are highly concerned about the problems the Internet can impose on their teenage children. 47% of parents are tend to worry about their children being exposed to inappropriate material on the Internet and 45% of the parents are concerned about their children’s behaviour towards each other both online offline. Only 31% of parents showed concern about the Internet taking away social time from the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parents, Teens, and Online Privacy|url=http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Teens-and-Privacy/Main-Report/Introduction.aspx|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=10 February 2013|author1=Mary Madden |author2=Sandra Cortesi |author3=Urs Gasser |author4=Amanda Lenhart |author5=Maeve Duggan |date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of Internet use on parent-child relationships===
Researcher Sanford Grossbart and others explores the relationship between the mother and child and how Internet use affects this relationship. This study forms its basis around Marvin Sussman and Suzanne Steinmetz’s idea that the relationship between parent and child is highly influenced by the changing experiences and events of each generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sussman |first1=Marvin |title=Handbook of Marriage and the Family|year=1987|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|author2=Suzanne Steinmetz}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Parental warmth” is a factor in how receptive a parent is to being taught the nuances of the Internet by their child versus the traditional method of the parent influencing the child. If the parent displayed “warm” tendencies she was more open to learning how to use the Internet from their child even if the parent happened to be more knowledgeable on the subject. This fosters teaching in a positive environment, which sustains a strong relationship between mother and child, encourages education, and promotes mature behaviour. “Cooler” mothers only allowed themselves to be taught if they thought that their child held the same amount of knowledge or greater and would dismiss the teaching otherwise suggesting a relationship that stems from the majority of influence coming from the parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sanford Grossbart |author2=Stephanie McConnell Hughes |author3=Susie Pryor |author4=Amber Yost |title=Socialization Aspects of Parents, Children, and the Internet|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|year=2002|volume=29|pages=66–70|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=8559|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite ''warm'' and ''cool'' parenting methods, parents who encounter a language barrier rely more heavily on their children to utilize the Internet. Vikki Katz of [[Rutgers University]] has studied the interaction between immigrant parents and children and how they use technology. Katz notes that the majority resources that immigrants find helpful are located online, however the search algorithms currently in place do not direct languages other than English appropriately.  Because of this shortcoming, parents strongly encourage their bilingual children to bridge the gap between the Internet and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidt|first=Alex|title=Immigrant Parents Rely On Kids For Help Online|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/10/12/141232534/immigrant-parents-rely-on-kids-for-help-online|work=NPR|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet is increasingly being used as a virtual babysitter when parents actively download applications specifically for their children with intentions to keep them calm. A survey conducted by [[Ipsos]] has found that half of the interviewed parents believe children ages 8–13 are old enough to own or carry smartphones thus increasing online content consumption in younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Atagana|first=Michelle|title=US parents relying on mobile devices to entertain their kids [Survey]|url=http://memeburn.com/2012/09/us-parents-relying-on-mobile-devices-to-entertain-their-kids-survey/|work=Memeburn|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[control engineering]] a  '''servomechanism''', sometimes shortened to '''servo''', is an automatic device that uses error-sensing [[negative feedback]] to correct the action of a mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baldor.com/pdf/manuals/1205-394.pdf Baldor Electric Company – Servo Control Facts]. Accessed 25 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  It usually includes a built-in [[encoder]] or other position feedback mechanism to ensure the output is achieving the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anaheimautomation.com/manuals/forms/servo-motor-guide.php Anaheim Automation: Servo Motor Guide]. Accessed 25 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term correctly applies only to systems where the [[feedback]] or error-correction signals help control mechanical position, speed or other parameters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/servomechanism.html BusinessDictionary.com definition]. Accessed 25 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an automotive [[power window]] control is not a servomechanism, as there is no automatic feedback that controls position—the operator does this by observation. By contrast a car's [[cruise control]] uses [[Control theory|closed-loop feedback]], which classifies it as a servomechanism.

==Applications==

===Position control===
[[Image:Pl control valve.jpg|thumb|right|Globe control valve with pneumatic actuator and "positioner". This is a servo  which ensures the valve opens to the desired position regardless of friction]]
A common type of servo provides ''position control''. Commonly, servos are electrical, [[hydraulic]] or [[pneumatic]]. They operate on the principle of negative feedback, where the control input is compared to the actual position of the mechanical system as measured by some type of [[transducer]] at the output. Any difference between the actual and wanted values (an "error signal") is amplified (and converted) and used to drive the system in the direction necessary to reduce or eliminate the error.  This procedure is one widely used application of [[control theory]]. Typical servos can give a rotary (angular) or linear output.

===Speed control===
Speed control via a [[Governor (device)|governor]] is another type of servomechanism. The [[steam engine]] uses mechanical governors; another early application was to govern the speed of [[water wheels]]. Prior to World War II the [[constant speed propeller]] was developed to control engine speed for maneuvering aircraft. Fuel controls for [[gas turbine]] engines employ either hydromechanical or electronic governing.

===Others===
Positioning servomechanisms were first used in military [[fire-control]] and [[marine navigation]] equipment. Today servomechanisms are used in [[CNC|automatic machine tools]], satellite-tracking antennas, remote control airplanes, automatic navigation systems on boats and planes, and [[antiaircraft]]-gun control systems. Other examples are [[fly-by-wire]] systems in [[aircraft]] which use servos to actuate the aircraft's control surfaces, and [[radio-controlled model]]s which use RC servos for the same purpose. Many [[autofocus]] cameras also use a servomechanism to accurately move the lens. A [[hard disk drive]] has a magnetic servo system with sub-micrometre positioning accuracy. In industrial machines, servos are used to perform complex motion, in many applications.

==Servomotor==

{{main|Servomotor|servo (radio control)}}
A ''[[servomotor]]'' is a specific type of motor that is combined with a [[rotary encoder]] or a [[potentiometer]] to form a servomechanism. This assembly may in turn form part of another servomechanism. A potentiometer provides a simple analog signal to indicate position, while an encoder provides position and usually speed feedback, which by the use of a [[PID controller]] allow more precise control of position and thus faster achievement of a stable position (for a given motor power). Potentiometers are subject to [[Temperature coefficient of resistance|drift]] when the temperature changes whereas encoders are more stable and accurate.

Servomotors are used for both high-end and low-end applications. On the high end are precision industrial components that use a rotary encoder. On the low end are inexpensive [[servo (radio control)|radio control servos]] (RC servos) used in [[radio-controlled model]]s which use a free-running motor and a simple potentiometer position sensor with an embedded controller. The term ''servomotor'' generally refers to a high-end industrial component while the term ''servo'' is most often used to describe the inexpensive devices that employ a potentiometer. [[Stepper motor]]s are not considered to be servomotors, although they too are used to construct larger servomechanisms. Stepper motors have inherent angular positioning, owing to their construction, and this is generally used in an open-loop manner without feedback. They are generally used for medium-precision applications.

RC servos are used to provide actuation for various mechanical systems such as the steering of a car, the control surfaces on a plane, or the rudder of a boat. Due to their affordability, reliability, and simplicity of control by microprocessors, they are often used in small-scale [[robotics]] applications. A standard RC receiver (or a microcontroller) sends [[pulse-width modulation]] (PWM) signals to the servo. The electronics inside the servo translate the width of the pulse into a position. When the servo is commanded to rotate, the motor is powered until the potentiometer reaches the value corresponding to the commanded position.

==History==
[[File:Scross helmsman.jpg|thumb|Power-assisted ship steering systems were early users of servomechanisms to ensure the rudder moved to the desired position.]]
[[James Watt]]'s [[steam engine]] [[Governor (device)|governor]] is generally considered the first powered feedback system. The [[windmill fantail]] is an earlier example of automatic control, but since it does not have an [[amplifier]] or [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], it is not usually considered a servomechanism.

The first feedback position control device was the ship [[steering engine]], used to position the rudder of large ships based on the position of the ship's wheel. 
[[John McFarlane Gray]] was a pioneer. His patented design was used on the [[SS Great Eastern]] in 1866.
[[Joseph Farcot]] may deserve equal credit for the feedback concept, with several patents between 1862 and 1868.&lt;ref name="Bennett1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=Stuart|title=A History of Control Engineering, 1800–1930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1gfKkqB_fTcC&amp;pg=PA98|date=1986-01-01|publisher=IET|isbn=978-0-86341-047-5|pages=98–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The telemotor was invented around 1872 by [[Andrew Betts Brown]], allowing elaborate mechanisms between the control room and the engine to be greatly simplified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Andrew_Betts_Brown Andrew Betts Brown&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Steam steering engines had the characteristics of a modern servomechanism: an input, an output, an error signal, and a means for amplifying the error signal used for negative feedback to drive the error towards zero. The Ragonnet [[power reverse]] mechanism was a general purpose air or steam-powered servo amplifier for linear motion patented in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Eugine L. Ragonnet, Controlling Mechanism for Locomotives, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=chtDAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent 930,225], Aug. 9, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrical servomechanisms were used as early as 1888 in [[Elisha Gray]]'s [[Telautograph]].

Electrical servomechanisms require a power amplifier. [[World War II]] saw the development of electrical [[fire-control]] servomechanisms, using an [[amplidyne]] as the power amplifier. [[Vacuum tube]] amplifiers were used in the [[UNISERVO]] tape drive for the [[UNIVAC I]] computer. The Royal Navy began experimenting with Remote Power Control ([[List of British ordnance terms#RPC|RPC]]) on [[HMS Champion (1915)|HMS Champion]] in 1928 and began using RPC to control searchlights in the early 1930s. During WW2 RPC was used to control gun mounts and gun directors.

Modern servomechanisms use solid state power amplifiers, usually built from [[MOSFET]] or [[thyristor]] devices. Small servos may use power [[transistor]]s.

The origin of the word is believed to come from the French "''Le Servomoteur''" or the slavemotor, first used by J. J. L. Farcot in 1868 to describe hydraulic and steam engines for use in ship steering.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;IEEE Industry Applications Magazine March/April 1996, pg 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest kind of servos use [[bang–bang control]]. More complex control systems use proportional control, [[PID control]], and state space control, which are studied in [[modern control theory]].

==Types of performances==

Servos can be classified by means of their feedback control systems:&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Younkin, Industrial Servo Control Systems – Fundamentals and Applications – Second Edition, Taylor and Francis, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

* type 0 servos: under steady-state conditions they produce a constant value of the output with a constant error signal;
* type 1 servos: under steady-state conditions they produce a constant value of the output with null error signal, but a constant rate of change of the reference implies a constant error in tracking the reference;
* type 2 servos: under steady-state conditions they produce a constant value of the output with null error signal. A constant rate of change of the reference implies a null error in tracking the reference. A constant rate of acceleration of the reference implies a constant error in tracking the reference.

The [[servo bandwidth]] indicates the capability of the servo to follow rapid changes in the commanded input.

The '''Shuttle Training Aircraft''' (STA) was a [[NASA]] training vehicle that duplicated the [[Space Shuttle]]'s approach profile and handling qualities, allowing [[Space Shuttle]] pilots to simulate Shuttle landings under controlled conditions before attempting the task on board the orbiter.

==Development==
The aircraft's exterior was modified to withstand the high aerodynamic forces incurred during training [[sortie]]s. A redesigned cockpit provided a high-fidelity simulation of the Shuttle Orbiter's controls and pilot vantage point; even the seats were fitted in the same position as those in the Space Shuttle.

==Operational history==

The four STAs were normally located at the [[NASA Forward Operating Location]] in [[El Paso]], [[Texas]] and rotated through [[Ellington Field]] ([[Houston]], Texas) for maintenance.&lt;ref name="nasa_sta" /&gt; The STA was also used at [[Kennedy Space Center]] in Florida. It was primarily flown by astronauts practicing landings at the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] and [[White Sands Space Harbor]] as well as to assess weather conditions prior to Space Shuttle launches and landings.

On December 3, 2003, a NASA [[Grumman Gulfstream II|Gulfstream II]] Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA) was flying a series of simulated shuttle landings to the Kennedy Space Center shuttle landing facility. On board the aircraft was an unidentified NASA astronaut pilot and two training personnel. The aircraft was on final approach at 13,000 feet when onboard instruments indicated a malfunction on one of the jet engine thrust reversers. The aircraft landed safely. A post-landing inspection showed that one of the 585-pound, 4-foot-wide, 5-foot-long thrust reversers had fallen off the aircraft. Divers later found the thrust reverser on the bottom of the nearby Banana River. An investigation showed that a bolt failed, releasing the part from the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/Safety_Issues/RiskManagement/nasabolted.html "NASA ties bolt to training scare"], ''Florida Today newspaper (article reprinted on the International Aviation Safety Association website)'', Feb 7, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/briefs/186678-1.html "NASA Jet Sheds Parts Over Florida"], ''AVweb website'', February 9, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flight profile==
The STA was particularly critical for Shuttle pilots in training because the Orbiter lacked atmospheric engines that would allow the craft to "go around" after a poor approach. After re-entry, the Shuttle was a very heavy [[Glider aircraft|glider]] (it was sometimes referred to as a 'flying brick') and as such had only one chance to land successfully.
[[File:KSC-98EC-1565.jpg|thumb|left|A STA flying above ''Discovery'' as it lands at the conclusion of [[STS-95]] in 1998]] 

To match the descent rate and drag profile of the real Shuttle at {{convert|37000|ft|m|-2}}, the main landing gear of the C-11A was lowered (the nose gear stayed retracted due to wind load constraints) and engine thrust was reversed. Its flaps could deflect upwards to decrease lift as well as downwards to increase lift.

Covers were placed on the left hand cockpit windows to provide the same view as from a Shuttle cockpit, and the left-hand pilot's seat was fitted with the same controls as a Shuttle. The STA's normal flight controls were moved to the right, where the instructor sat. Both seat positions had a [[head-up display]] (HUD).

In a normal exercise, the pilot descended to {{convert|20000|ft|m|-3}} at an airspeed of {{convert|280|kn|km/h|0}}, {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} from the landing target. The pilot then rolled the STA at {{convert|12000|ft|m|-2}}, {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} from landing. The nose of the aircraft was then dropped to increase speed to {{convert|300|kn|km/h|-1}}, descending at a 20-degree angle on the outer glide slope (OGS). The outer glide slope aiming point was {{convert|7500|ft|m|0}} short of the runway threshold, and used [[Precision approach path indicator|PAPIs]] for visual guidance in addition to the MLS system. At {{convert|2000|ft|m|0}} the guidance system changed to pre-flare and shortly after, at {{convert|1700|ft|m|0}}, the pilot started the flare maneuver to gradually reduce the descent angle and transition to the inner glide slope (IGS) which was 1.5 degrees from {{convert|300|ft|m|0}} onwards, using a "ball-bar" system for visual guidance. The shuttle landing gear release was simulated at {{convert|300|ft|m|-1}} above the ground, since the STA main gear remained down for the whole simulation. The nose gear of the STA was lowered at {{convert|150|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} AGL in case of an inadvertent touchdown with the runway surface.

If the speed was correct, a green light on the instrument panel simulated shuttle landing when the pilot's eyes were {{convert|32|ft|m|0}} above the runway. This was the exact position that the pilot's head would be in during an actual landing. In the exercise, the STA was still flying {{convert|20|ft|m|0}} above the ground. The instructor pilot deselected the simulation mode, stowed the thrust reversers, and the instructor executed a ''go-around'', never actually landing the aircraft (on training approaches).

==Avionics==
[[Image:Shuttle Landing Simulator cockpit.jpg|thumb|300px|The Shuttle Training Aircraft's cockpit. The commander's side of the cockpit, at left, featured a Shuttle-type heads-up display (HUD), rotational hand controller (RHC) used to fly the vehicle, and multi-function displays. The instructor pilot, who occupied the right-hand side of the STA cockpit, had access to a similar heads-up display, as well as conventional aircraft controls and instruments.]]
A sophisticated computer system installed on board the STA simulated the flight dynamics of the orbiter with nearly perfect accuracy. The STA's highly realistic simulation of the orbiter was not limited to handling characteristics, but also implemented the shuttle control interfaces for the pilot.

An onboard computer called the Advanced Digital Avionics System (ADAS) controlled the Direct Lift Control (DLC) and the in-flight reverse thrust during Simulation Mode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiscorp.com/projects/control/sta/ IIS Corp. Shuttle Training Aircraft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412185542/http://www.iiscorp.com/projects/control/sta/ |date=2008-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every shuttle commander practiced at least 1,000 landings in this manner, as had each mission's shuttle pilot.&lt;ref name="nasa_sta"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/preparingtravel/rtf_week5_sta.html NASA - Test Drive: Shuttle Training Aircraft Preps Astronauts for Landing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of Shuttle Training Aircraft==
Four Gulfstream II aircraft constituted the now retired STA fleet, although other Gulfstream II aircraft, lacking STA capabilities, are still used by NASA for personnel transport purposes. Although the majority of the fleet had markings similar to those pictured above, paint schemes do vary slightly across aircraft. The STA tail numbers were:

* N944NA (sn144)
* N945NA (sn118) (On July 13, 2017, a ribbon cutting ceremony was conducted and this aircraft is now in permanent display at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.)
* N946NA (sn146) (On September 21, 2011, this aircraft became a permanent display at the Texas Air &amp; Space Museum in Amarillo, Texas.&lt;ref name="deactivate_sn146"&gt;[http://deepbluehorizon.blogspot.com/2011/09/nasa-space-shuttle-trainer-retires-in.html NASA Space Shuttle Trainer Retires In Amarillo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deactivate_sn146_2"&gt;[http://www.connectamarillo.com/news/story.aspx?id=665958#.ULa7p6w2vqQ NASA aircraft flown by Rick Husband calls Amarillo 'home']&lt;/ref&gt;)
* N947NA (sn147) (Currently on permanent display at the Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon)

On August 22, 2011, NASA announced that all four Shuttle Training Aircraft would be retired at various NASA facilities around the country, with N944 retiring at the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]].&lt;ref name="Shuttle Training Aircraft to be Retired at NASA Dryden"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/Features/shuttle_training_aircraft.html Shuttle Training Aircraft to be Retired at NASA Dryden]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
In the event NASA's [[T-38 Talon]]s were not available, the STAs were used for transporting shuttle crew members between major sites, namely from [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]] in Houston to [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Cape Canaveral]], Florida.

==Planned use of the 737 as the STA==
During the early phases of the Shuttle program, NASA originally considered using the [[Boeing 737]] airliner as the basis for the STA, but rejected it due to cost and opted for the less-expensive Gulfstream II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=John W.|title=Forever Young: A Life of Adventure in Air and Space|year=2012|publisher=University Press of Florida|author2=Hansen, James R. |format=Kindle eBook|chapter=IV: The Shuttle Era|quote="I went to Boeing in Seattle to see if its 737 airliner could be used to simulate the orbiter, particularly on its final high-altitude overhead approach to landing. We found that it could be done in the 737 simulator if the pilot could use reverse thrust and all the machine’s drag devices at a speed of 300 knots. The real drawback was the expense of the Boeing 737, which we could not afford."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological Review, 103, 650-669.&lt;/ref&gt; estimates which of two alternatives has a higher value on a criterion by choosing the alternative based on the first cue that discriminates between the alternatives, where cues are ordered by [[cue validity]] (highest to lowest).  In the original formulation, the cues were assumed to have binary values (yes or no) or have an unknown value.

[[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and [[Daniel Goldstein]] discovered that the heuristic did surprisingly well at making accurate [[inferences]] in real-world environments, such as inferring which of two cities is larger. The heuristic has since been modified and applied to domains from [[medicine]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[political forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graefe|first=Andreas|author2=Armstrong, J.

'''''The Tennis Partner''''' is the second of [[Abraham Verghese]]'s books. Published in 1999, when he was a [[physician]] practicing [[internal medicine]] in [[El Paso]], [[Texas]], this is an [[autobiography|autobiographical]] memoir, and Abraham Verghese writes of his experience moving to El Paso in the midst of an unraveling marriage. Once there, he meets and eventually becomes a mentor to David Smith, a medical resident at the hospital where Verghese worked and a brilliant tennis player recovering from drug addiction.&lt;ref name="tennis"&gt;{{cite book|last = Verghese|first = Abraham|title = The Tennis Partner| publisher = Harper Perennial|date=October 1, 1999|pages=352 pp|ISBN=0-06-093113-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his own love for the game and as part of his effort to reach out to the troubled resident, Verghese begins to play singles tennis regularly during their free time outside the hospital. What starts as a casual game between the two men eventually develops into a complex ritual that allows them to develop a deep friendship and understanding of the pressures they each face. In the hospital, Verghese is the teacher and Smith the student. On the court, however, Smith, the one-time professional player, becomes the teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/author/authorExtra.aspx?isbn13=9780060931131&amp;displayType=readingGuide|title=Reading Guide: The Tennis Partner|author=Harper Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story tells of their all too brief friendship as Smith battles and eventually succumbs to his disease, and Verghese's helpless attempts to intervene.&lt;ref name="tennis"/&gt;

While cited as fiction, ''The Tennis Partner'' is heavily autobiographical.
