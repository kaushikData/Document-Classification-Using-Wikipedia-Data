'''Augustin Andriamananoro''' (born 14 August 1968 in [[Soamahamanina]], [[Madagascar]]) is a consultant in [[information and communications technology]] and a politician.

==ICT Project Manager ==
In 1998, Andriamananoro began to gain experience in software engineering and information technologies while in France.  Afterwards, he engaged in numerous projects in the Caribbean and Indian Oceans. He was also the project director of Société M &amp; Associés in Guadeloupe in 2002, as well as the General Manager of the Osmosis Business Solutions O.I. group in Antananarivo until 2008. Andriamananoro continues to serve as the General Director to the Malagasy Authority Office for the Study and Regulation of Telecommunications for Madagascar OMERT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omert.mg/ |title=ARTEC &amp;#124; Accueil |publisher=Omert.mg |date= |accessdate=2015-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920000151/http://www.omert.mg/ |archive-date=20 September 2018 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andriamananoro was certified by the Galilee Institute of Management in Israël,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galilcol.ac.il/ |title=Galilee International Management Institute - Home |publisher=Galilcol.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2015-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his capacity as ICT Senior Manager, he was also certified by ''EMPIM''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madagate.com/reportages/photos/4504-texas-usa-augustin-andriamananoro-a-la-nasa.html |title=Texas U.S.A.

[[File:Augustin Andriamananoro.jpg|alt=Public Figure, Former Minister Augustin ANDRIAMANANORO|thumb]]

==Public figure==
In November 2009, as Minister of Telecommunications, Post and New Technology, he had the power devolved from the [[President of Madagascar]] to enable the trunk routes on fibre optic cable for the whole of [[East Africa]], a project known as [[LION (cable system)|Project Lion]]. This would link East Africa to East Asia and Europe with submarine internet fibre-optic cables. In March 2010, the Telecom Company [[:fr:TELMA|TELMA]], at that time, laid another [[submarine communications cable|submarine cable]] in the ''Consortium Eassy, which is a project reliant Madagascar with East Africa'', ("Consortium Project to relay Madagascar to the African continent and the wider world").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=fr |url=http://andriamananoro.net/madagascar-informations-politiques-malagasy-photos-madagascar/a-la-une-de-madagascar/madagate-video-et-affiche/3028-madagascar-backbone-telma-ne-perd-pas-le-nord-avec-20-millions-de-dollars-.html |title=Madagascar Backbone: TELMA ne perd pas le Nord avec 20 millions de dollars |publisher=Andriamananoro.net |date=22 February 2013 |accessdate=6 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614030446/http://andriamananoro.net/madagascar-informations-politiques-malagasy-photos-madagascar/a-la-une-de-madagascar/madagate-video-et-affiche/3028-madagascar-backbone-telma-ne-perd-pas-le-nord-avec-20-millions-de-dollars-.html |archivedate=14 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.telma.mg/images/pdf/backbone_avril09.pdf|work=telma,mg|date=April 2009|title=Le Backbone National Telma: Plus de 3000km fibre optic des 2009|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andriamananoro ensured [[third-party access]] by other telecommunications and infrastructure operators, and established licenses for [[3G]] Internet service, which now cover the entire country of [[Madagascar]]. With over {{convert|6000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of fibre-optic cable, Madagascar became the first country in Africa to be "all fibre", and is the best country in Africa for its telecommunications infrastructure.

He became the Chairman of the Bord to the National Shareholding Company ([http://www.sonapar.mg/ SONAPAR])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=fr|author= |url=http://www.sonapar.mg/reveal/ |title=SOciété NAtionale de PARticipations &amp;#124 |publisher=Sonapar.mg |date= |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 10 December 2010 to December 2014.

During this time he was the official General Manager of the Authority Office on Regulation of Madagascar Telecommunications, OMERT: roughly equivalent to [[Ofcom]] in the United Kingdom or the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]]). He relieved his post in May 2014.

==Politician==
Mr Augustin Andriamananoro, a native of [[Soamahamanina]], has been arbitrarily arrested, at a family funeral, by the force elements ([http://www.lexpressmada.com/blog/actualites/proces-andriamananoro-verdict-sous-haute-surveillance-a-anosy/ EMMOREG]) on Saturday 10 December 2016. He was imprisoned at the detention centrale of Antanimora, for opposing the illegal occupation of land (land grabs) for gold mining extraction by the Chinese company [http://www.midi-madagasikara.mg/economie/2016/07/19/soamahamanina-suspension-activites-de-lentreprise-jiuxing-mines-s-a-r-l/ Jiuxing Mines SARL], in his home village of Soamahamanina located 68 km west of Antananarivo Madagascar.

" Vox Populi vox dei ".  Basically, it was the message that the priest of ECAR Ste Dorothée Soamahamanina passed to the faithful of this place, which had become "historical" as well as to the peers of Augustin Andriamananoro, in this case his family and the members of the [http://www.newsmada.com/2016/12/20/affaire-augustin-a-le-mapar-interpelle-la-communaute-internationale/ MAPAR]. For a mass was organized in this church to support the former Minister of Telecommunications, in particular and for the country in general.

In November 2010, Andriamananoro was promoted to be Head of the Campaign for the [[Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2010|Constitutional Referendum for the Fourth Republic of Madagascar]]). With [[universal suffrage]], he returned more than 75% of the [[Direct election|popular vote]].

In July 2013, he became one of the ''Vice President'' of [http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20161211-madagascar-arrestation-augustin-andriamananoro-ancien-ministre-dirigeant-mapar-andry-rajoelina MAPAR],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3Qokp5cAIk |title=EMISSION SPECIAL DU 22 JANVIER 2015 Augustin ANDRIAMANANORO |publisher=YouTube.com |date=22 January 2015 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  founded by [[Andry Rajoelina]], who had the majority in the Parliament House, of Madagascar since 20 December 2013: [[qua|in his capacity of being]] the state's Vice Président.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1163">In economics, the '''Backus–Smith puzzle''' or '''consumption – real-exchange-rate anomaly''' is the observation that the [[correlations]] between [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] and [[real exchange rate]]s are zero or negative.  This is contrary to economic theory which predicts that with full [[financial risk|risk]] sharing, relative consumption should be perfectly correlated with the real exchange rate. Countries with relative low prices should receive a transfer to take advantage of cheap consumption.  This anomaly was first documented by Backus and Smith (1993).&lt;ref name="BackusSmith92"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Backus | first1 = David K.| author-link1 = David K.

'''Bicycle Technologies International, Ltd. (BTI)''' is a global distributor of [[bicycle]] components and accessories, based in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. BTI also participates in the community through [[cycling advocacy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Quintana |first=Chris |title=A little elbow room for BTI |url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/business/090412BTI#.UQcEOInjlYh |accessdate=29 January 2013 |newspaper=Santa Fe New Mexican |date=September 4, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; on local and national levels. The company is [[Privately held company|privately held]] and does not disclose its sales figures.

==History==
Andrew Wright and [[Preston Martin]] founded Bicycle Technologies International, Ltd. (BTI) in Ashland, OR in 1993.  BTI introduced the bicycle industry’s first service center that [[Local bike shop|bike shops]] could send shocks to for tuning and repair, known as [[Shock Treatment]].&lt;ref name="bicycleretailer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|first=BRAIN|title=BTI Celebrates 15 Years in Business|url=http://www.bicycleretailer.com/north-america/2008/05/13/bti-celebrates-15-years-business#.UQcGzYnjlYg|accessdate=29 January 2013|newspaper=Bicycle Retailer and Industry News|date=2008-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BTI’s first wholesale catalog, also released in 1993, was a twenty-four page newsprint flyer with hand-illustrated [[Schematic|schematic drawings]] of every major fork design. From the beginning, BTI fostered a close relationship with early suspension manufacturers, offering a full line of replacement components. Today BTI provides suspension repair, tuning and other authorized warranty center services for 18 major brands.&lt;ref name="bicycleretailer_a"&gt;{{cite news|last=BRAIN|first=Staff|title=BTI Grows Factory Service Capabilities|url=http://www.bicycleretailer.com/north-america/2011/05/19/bti-grows-factory-service-capabilities#.UQcIfYnjlYg|accessdate=29 January 2013|newspaper=Bicycle Retailer and Industry News|date=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1996, the company was looking for a more central location from where they could serve dealers on both coasts. With the help of friends the young company packed up its inventory and relocated to Santa Fe, NM.&lt;ref name="bicycleretailer" /&gt;

Over time, BTI expanded its selection with more shop essentials covering every aspect of the modern bicycle. BTI now stocks over 22,000 unique SKUs from nearly 300 brands.&lt;ref name="bicyclenewswire"&gt;{{cite web|title=BTI Catalog Now Shipping|url=http://www.bicyclenewswire.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.showreleasemore&amp;id=3258|publisher=Bicycle News Wire|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Facility===
In June 2012, BTI publicly unveiled its plans for a new facility. The company announced plans to make a significant investment in a new 47,500 square foot building that will expand the current warehouse operation and will bring two other facilities back under one roof. New Mexico Gov. [[Susana Martinez]] spoke at the event, praising BTI for creating quality jobs in the state. Santa Fe City Councilwoman Rebecca Wurzberger said BTI was the type of locally grown, green company that Santa Fe wants to attract not only for job creation, but for community building activities as well. She cited BTI's role in organizing the 2012 IMBA World Summit in Santa Fe as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|first=BRAIN|title=BTI breaks ground on new distribution center|url=http://www.bicycleretailer.com/north-america/2012/07/02/bti-breaks-ground-new-distribution-center#.UQcSeYnjlYg|accessdate=29 January 2013|newspaper=Bicycle Retailer and Industry News|date=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Desk|first=News|title=Bicycle Technologies International Expands In Sante Fe, New Mexico, Doubling Its Workforce|url=http://www.areadevelopment.com/newsItems/7-3-2012/bicycle-technologies-international-expands-santefe-988801.shtml|accessdate=29 January 2013|newspaper=Area Development Online|date=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated on a recently purchased plot of land 5 miles from the current warehouse, BTI's new facility will be the anchor tenant for a new master plan employment zone located next to the [[Santa Fe Community College]] and near [[Rancho Viejo, New Mexico|Rancho Viejo]]. Architectural plans for this site have been completed by Dekker/Parich/ Sabatini Architects. Klinger Constructors LLC has been contracted to undertake construction upon BTI’s acquisition of the property.

==Brands==
BTI’s high rate of growth is attributed to the company's broad wholesale product selection. BTI inventories components from all three of the largest bicycle drivetrain brands, [[Shimano]], [[SRAM Corporation|SRAM]] and [[Campagnolo]]. BTI also offers a full range of accessories, including computers, lights, pumps, nutrition and apparel.&lt;ref name="bicyclenewswire" /&gt;

==Services==
BTI’s Factory Service Center is a suspension and disc brake repair service that bike shops send repairs to when they do not have the time, proper tools or training to process repairs in-house. The department takes in forks for repair and tuning - replacing seals and performance tuning the shock for the specific rider and terrain. BTI also performs warranty repair services for several of its top brands.&lt;ref name="bicycleretailer_a" /&gt;

==Advocacy==
BTI donates funds annually to bicycle interest groups such as Bikes Belong, [[International Mountain Bicycling Association]] and National Bicycle Dealers Association.&lt;ref name="bti-usa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Advocacy|url=https://www.bti-usa.com/public/advocacy|publisher=BTI|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; BTI staff regularly attend the annual National Bike Summit in Washington, DC with the New Mexico bicycle delegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bike Summit |url=http://www.bikeleague.org/conferences/summit12/ |accessdate=29 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920221236/http://www.bikeleague.org/conferences/summit12/ |archivedate=20 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; BTI’s in-house advocacy team is also involved in Santa Fe City and County policy making. In 2010 BTI launched Advocacy Roundup&lt;ref name="bti-usa" /&gt; a program that encourages wholesale customers to donate spare change from purchase transactions to a fund designed to promote the work of advocacy organizations. BTI was recognized for its advocacy efforts by the [[League of American Bicyclists]], who awarded the company Gold level status in its Bicycle Friendly Business category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bicycle Friendly Business / Gold Level |url=http://www.bikeleague.org/programs/bicyclefriendlyamerica/bicyclefriendlybusiness/bfb_bicycle_technologies_international.php |publisher=League of American Cyclists |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523215623/http://www.bikeleague.org/programs/bicyclefriendlyamerica/bicyclefriendlybusiness/bfb_bicycle_technologies_international.php |archivedate=2012-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boys &amp; Girls Harbor, Inc.''' (formerly called '''Boys Harbor''') is an American educational organization, headquartered in the [[Manhattan]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

Founded by [[Anthony Drexel Duke]] in 1937, as a sleepaway [[summer camp]] for boys in [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref&gt;Friend Recalls Young Deans,
Ellis Henican, [[Newsday]], 10 Dec 2003: A04.&lt;/ref&gt;  the organization has grown into several programs.

The Harbor was one of the first organizations to launch a [[Charter schools in the United States|charter school]] in New York state and has since then created programs that include [[pre-school]], extended day tutoring, [[literacy]] training, [[Substance abuse prevention|substance-abuse prevention]], [[college preparation]], workforce readiness, and a conservatory for the [[performing arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theharbor.org].  Boys &amp; Girls Harbor, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three-quarters of the students range from the ages of 6 to 17 and are 56 percent [[African American]], 35 percent [[Latino]], and 9 percent from another heritage. The constituents average a general population of 53 percent male and 47 percent female. Most of the students live in East or Central [[Harlem]] (67 percent), but 17 percent live in [[The Bronx]], 6 percent live in [[Brooklyn]], 5 percent live in [[Queens]], and the remaining 5 percent live elsewhere in the [[New York metropolitan area|tri-state area]].&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet 2009"&gt;"Fact Sheet" 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder and history==
Duke, a member of the [[Duke family]] and a descendant of the [[Biddle family|Biddle]] and [[Drexel family|Drexel families]], attended [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]], a preparatory school in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], [[New Hampshire]], and in 1941, graduated from [[Princeton University]], in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]].

Duke started Boys and Girls Harbor in 1937, at the age of 19, as a summer camp for immigrant and disadvantaged boys. Recruiting friends and family as camp counselors, Duke believed that fresh air mixed with discipline and mutual respect would help discover these inner-city boys' talents and potential.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (November 2, 2005).  [http://www.princeton.edu/~paw/web_exclusives/alumni_spotlight/as110205duke.html "Nonprofit Offers Inner-City Youths What Suburbs Take for Granted"].  [[Princeton University]].  Retrieved June 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After three years (1935–1937) of orchestrating and planning this summer program, Duke and fellow St. Paul's friends found a vacant campsite called Duck Island near [[Southampton, New York|Southampton]], New York. Duck Island remained the site of "Boys Harbor" until Duke was commissioned in the [[U.S. Navy]] to fight in [[World War II]] in 1941. The camp reopened in 1947 in [[Connecticut]] at a place called "Lord's Highway"; the camp migrated to several other locations until 1954 when [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], New York, became the camp's permanent home.

In 1963, Duke acquired a townhouse on East 94th Street in New York City to create a year-round center in the city for the Harbor children. The 1960s through the 1970s were a time of rapid growth for the institution; it upgraded to the former [[Heckscher Building]] at 104th Street and [[Fifth Avenue]] (Boys and Girls Harbor's present-day home) to accommodate the expanding number of programs, participants, and staff. Also, the institution became fully coeducational and extended its mission to performing arts programs, day care for preschoolers, and drug- and alcohol-prevention classes.

Since the starting days of Boys &amp; Girls Harbor, Duke dedicated his life to the mission he created back in 1937: "to empower the lives of inner-city young people, helping them overcome adversity as they achieve their creative, intellectual, and economic dreams."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Boys &amp; Girls Harbor 1997 Information Packet.&lt;/ref&gt; His goal of properly educating the youth of America and giving children an opportunity to actively participate in society is still successfully being achieved to this day.

"My feeling is that if we're going to preserve our democracy, we can't have so many people falling through the cracks. We've got to give them their desserts, which is not just respect, it's a good education." – Anthony Drexel Duke&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

On April 30, 2014, Duke died of cancer at the age of 95.&lt;ref&gt;Vecsey, Taylor K. (April 30, 2014).

==Programs==
The Harbor is located at One East 104th Street, and features pre-kindergarten, The Emily N. Carey Harbor Preschool, Harbor K.I.D.S. (ages 5&amp;ndash;11) and Harbor T.E.E.N. (ages 12&amp;ndash;18) after-school programs, K.I.D.S., T.E.E.N. and Conservatory Summer Programs, and the [[Harbor Conservatory for the Performing Arts]].

'''Camillo Castiglioni''' (22 October 1879 – 18 December 1957) was an Italian-Austrian financier and banker, and was the wealthiest man in Central Europe during [[World War I]]. Nicknamed “Austrian [[Hugo Stinnes|Stinnes]]”, he was active in [[aviation]]'s pioneering days and invested in the [[arts]].

==Early life==
Castiglioni was born in [[Trieste]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]], to the chief rabbi. It is not known when Camillo developed his interest in aviation, but it is known that he was passionate about flying. Camillo's education was primarily law, gaining employment as an attorney and legal officer of a bank in [[Padua]], quickly learning international finance and how to manage capital.

He was the son of a rubber maker, so naturally Camillo found work with the Austro-American ''Gummiwarenfabrik AG'' (rubber products) in [[Vienna]] as an Agent for the Kaufmann automobile tire division in [[Constantinople]]. Camillo found great success in this position, demonstrating his abilities to negotiate and structure financial deals. In fact, Camillo was so successful, he was promoted to Director of the export department of the parent company in Vienna.

Around 1901, along with Viktor Silberer and Franz Hinterstoissera Camillo helped to create the Viennese aero club (later Austrian aero club). He eventually was made deputy director, then in 1904 he was appointed to General Director of the company. Through his experience in the rubber and tire production field, Camillo saw the birth of aviation as an industry, going from a ballooning hobby, to makeshift glider craft requiring tires, to fully operational aircraft operated by engines. He met many influential men in his business, and came to realize that aviation sparked not only his passion for flight, but also recognized the tremendous financial opportunity of aviation's potential as an industry.

In order to draw from the arising enthusiasm for airplanes and ballooning, as well as to take advantage of the lucrative business the hobby generated, Camillo established one of his first companies, ''[[Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft|Luftfahrzeug-Gesellschaft]]'', in 1907. Being a pure commercial firm – it acquired the Etrich balloon patents and sold balloon fliers in Austria Hungary. There were many contests that these inspired balloon drivers entered, and Camillo was no different- he bought his own balloon and successfully took his balloon driver examination on 24 August 1909.

==Aviation financing==
During the First World War, became one of the richest and most influential financiers in Central Europe.

The first major investor in the series production of aircraft.
1914 Purchased the German aircraft company [[Hansa- und Brandenburgische Flugzeugwerke]], which employed [[Ernst Heinkel]] as its chief designer. Acquired a majority holding in [[Austro-Daimler]] with its chief designers [[Puch]] and [[Porsche]].  Press "Czar" and sponsor of the arts (financed [[Max Reinhardt]] and helped him to organize the [[Salzburg Festival]]). After a series of setbacks, his financial empire broke up in 1926. He retired to [[Switzerland]], then to [[Milan]] where he set up a private bank and once again amassed a considerable fortune. After the Second World War, negotiated a large US loan for his friend [[Josip Broz Tito]] in [[Yugoslavia]]. When Tito refused to pay his commission, Castiglioni succeeded in getting Yugoslavian assets in Italy worth millions sequestered. 1916 Awarded the [[Franz Joseph Order]] with ribbon on the [[Military Service Cross]] for his services to aviation 1918 with the [[St-Georges Order]] for his achievements in the war material production.

Castiglioni became rich in ventures during the period of inflation, acquiring a majority interest in ''[[Alpine Montan AG]]''. The Austrian aviation company ''[[Österreichische Luftfahrtsgesellschaft]]'' was founded by him.

==BMW influence==
Castiglioni significantly influenced the development of BMW AG in its early years. The granting of a license agreement by Austro-Daimler to the Rapp-Werke in 1917 was partly attributable to Castiglioni. 1918 At Castiglioni's insistence the Wiener Bankverein (Vienna) acquired the majority of BMW's share capital. 1922 Castiglioni purchased all the equipment relating to engine construction, the associated know-how and the rights to the name "Bayerische Motoren Werke AG" from the BMW AG, which was renamed Süddeutsche Bremse AG. Castiglioni in turn renamed the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke to BMW AG and allowed the renamed company to continue production at the BFW plant. From the establishment of BMW AG until November 9, 1922 and then from 1924 to 1929, he was a member of the Supervisory Board and President of BMW AG. 1928 Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board.

His was one of the voices that urged BMW in 1928 to purchase the Eisenach Automobilwerke. Due to financial difficulties in 1929 he was obliged to surrender his holding of BMW shares to a consortium of banks ([[Deutsche Bank]], [[Disconto-Gesellschaft|Disconto]], [[Bankhaus Hagen]] etc.).

A consortium led by the Deutsche Bank and the Diskonto-Gesellschaft purchased the BMW shares previously held by Camillo Castiglioni, who was facing problems of liquidity.

==Failed speculation and bankruptcy==
In February 1924, Castiglioni partnered with [[Fritz Mannheimer]], and later other influential bankers to speculate on the [[devaluation]] of the [[French franc]]. They [[Short (finance)|shorted]] hundreds of millions of franc, eventually causing the franc to drop almost 40% in less than a month. By the beginning of March 1924, one [[United States dollar]] was worth 28 francs. Then, however, investment bank [[Lazard]], on the behalf of [[Banque de France]] and powered by [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Morgan Syndicate Lends $100,000,000 To Bank of France |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/03/13/archives/morgan-syndicate-lends-100000000-to-bank-of-france-credit-here.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |date=1924-03-13 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; bought immense amounts of francs, causing the franc to rise again, to 15 franc per dollar. Castiglioni, Mannheimer and their partners lost millions.

In September 1924, the Austrian [[Depositenbank]], of which Castiglioni had been president, collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Austria Is Shaken by Big Bank Crash |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/09/30/archives/austria-is-shaken-by-big-bank-crash-castiglioni-richest-man-in-the.html |work=The New York Times |publisher= |date=1924-09-30 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A warrant for his arrest on a charge of fraud was issued, but Castiglioni had been taken care to be in Italy when the crash came. The Austrian State said that if he deposited $4,200,000 (${{Inflation|US|4200000|1924}} in present-day value), he could return unmolested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Gone |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,736356,00.html |work=[[Time Magazine]] |publisher= |date=1924-10-06 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Castiglioni built up a large art collection and a theatre in [[Vienna]].  He was the richest man in Central Europe and much beloved by the Viennese whom he assisted financially on Sundays and odd occasions. He was also a patron of the arts and for some time supported the famed producer [[Max Reinhardt]], for whom he built a theater. So fond was he of appearing in the public limelight that he lived with all the pomp and ceremony of royalty, even traveling in the Kaiser Karl's private parlor car, which he bought.

Because of his famous banking activities, his life was documented in a 1988 movie on television titled ''[[Camillo Castiglioni oder die Moral der Haifische]]'' (in English: ''Camillo Castiglioni, or the morality of sharks''), directed by [[Peter Patzak]].

The '''Coleman A. Young Municipal Center''' is a government office building and courthouse located at 2 Woodward Avenue in [[Downtown Detroit|Downtown]] [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. Originally called the '''City-County Building''', it was renamed for the former [[Mayor of Detroit|Detroit Mayor]] [[Coleman A. Young]], shortly after his death in 1997. It serves as the [[Government of Detroit|City of Detroit government]] headquarters.

The Coleman A. Young Municipal Center houses offices, courtrooms, and meeting rooms. The class-A office building stands near the [[Renaissance Center]], [[Hart Plaza]], [[One Detroit Center]], [[Courtyard by Marriott - Downtown Detroit]], and the [[Millender Center]].

==Architecture==
[[File:Detroit December 2015 41 (Coleman A. Young Municipal Center).jpg|thumb|left|The Coleman A. Young Municipal Center in December 2015]]

The modernist [[International style (architecture)|International-style]] building was designed by the architectural firm of Harley, Ellington and Day. Construction began on the [[list of tallest buildings in Detroit|skyscraper]] in 1951 and was completed in 1954. It is 20 floors tall, and including the basement has 21 total floors.

Three sides of the building's exterior are faced with white Vermont [[marble]] with black marble [[spandrel]] panels beneath the windows of the Courts Tower to emphasize the building's vertical lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Meyer, Katherine Mattingly and Martin C.P. McElroy with Introduction by W. Hawkins Ferry, Hon A.I.A.| title=Detroit Architecture A.I.A. Guide Revised Edition | year= 1980| publisher= Wayne State University Press| isbn = 0-8143-1651-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The verticality of the tower section, with its white marble-clad piers and dark spandrels, offers a distinct contrast with the 14-story Administration Tower office section, in which horizontal lines are emphasized. The brick of the Randolph Street facade was not covered with marble to allow for a more economical future expansion.

===Towers===
;Administration Tower
The 14-story portion of this complex is called the Administration Tower and is {{convert|197|ft|abbr=on}} tall, from the ground to the [[mechanical floor|mechanical penthouse roof parapet]]. 	The Administration Tower holds offices for the City of Detroit and Wayne County, as well as doctor clinics, laboratories, a municipal library, and the City Council [[auditorium]] chambers on the 13th floor.

;Courts Tower 
The 20-story portion of this complex is called the Courts Tower and is {{convert|318|ft|abbr=on}} tall.  It contains office space on floors 1 through 8, and [[courtroom]]s, judges chambers, and [[jury room]]s on floors 9 through 19, with the 20th floor housing the building's [[mechanical floor|mechanical equipment]].

A marble wall element rises {{convert|43.5|ft|m}} high stands {{convert|17|ft|m}} west of the Courts Tower, and is connected to the tower by a canopy that forms the Woodward Avenue entrance.  [[Bas relief]]s of the Detroit and Wayne County seals are carved in the wall, along with a quote from the Bible ([[2 Corinthians]] 3:17) ''Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty''.

[[File:The Spirit of Detroit.JPG|thumb|300px|"[[The Spirit of Detroit]]" by sculptor [[Marshall Fredericks]], at the municipal center.]]

===Statue===
"[[The Spirit of Detroit]]," a {{convert|25|ft|m}} tall bronze statue by sculptor [[Marshall Fredericks]], is located at the Courts Tower's marble wall element. As one of Detroit's most easily identifiable landmarks, a sketch of the statue appears as the central element of most of the logos of Detroit's city departments and services.

When Detroit sports teams (the Red Wings, Pistons and Tigers) have been in contention for their league's championship, the statue has traditionally been outfitted with a huge version of the appropriate team's jersey.

===Skyway===
An enclosed [[skyway]] over Randolph Street connects to the [[Millender Center]], [[Courtyard by Marriott - Downtown Detroit]], and the [[Renaissance Center]] as a sort of "enclosed city within a city". Entrance from the walkway to the third-floor level requires a security pass, and persons without a pass must return to the main floor entrance.

==Operations==
The Coleman A. Young Municipal Center is operated by the Detroit-Wayne Joint Building Authority, which was created in 1948 by the [[Michigan Legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwjba.com/propertyprofile.html|title=Property Profile|publisher=dwjba.com|accessdate=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building contains a [[library]], a [[courthouse]], and the [[city hall]].

When it opened, the City-County Building replaced both the historic [[Detroit City Hall]] and [[Wayne County Building]].  Many [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] offices have since moved to the nearby [[Guardian Building]] which now serves as the county's headquarters. The offices of the Wayne County Clerk remain in the building as does one division of the Wayne County (Third Judicial) Circuit Court, Circuit Court Administrative Offices and the Wayne County Probate Court.

On June 28, 2008, the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center was struck by [[lightning]] during a series of intense [[thunderstorm]]s, and caused a [[transformer]] fire within the building.  It re-opened for service on July 9, 2008.  The smoke and fire damage is easily visible across the river, in [[Windsor, Ontario]], where many windows have been removed, or have shattered.

'''Colin "Tich" Wesley''' (born 5 September 1937 in [[Durban]], [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]]) is a former [[South Africa]]n [[cricket]]er who played in three [[Test cricket|Tests]] in 1960.

He played [[first-class cricket]] for [[KwaZulu-Natal cricket team|Natal]] from 1957 to 1966 as a middle-order batsman and left-arm spin bowler. He toured England with the [[South African cricket team in England in 1960|South African team in 1960]]. His highest first-class score was 131, made after Natal [[Follow-on|followed on]] against the [[New Zealand cricket team in South Africa in 1961–62|New Zealanders in 1961-62]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/25/25313.html| title = Natal v New Zealanders 1961-62| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His only century in the [[Currie Cup (cricket)|Currie Cup]] came in his last first-class season, when he captained Natal B against [[Northerns cricket team|North Eastern Transvaal]] and made 120 in the first innings, the only century in the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/27/27918.html| title = Natal B v North Eastern Transvaal 1965-66| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He briefly returned to provincial cricket to captain the Natal team, which played under the name "C.

'''Computer-aided facility management''' ('''CAFM''') is the support of [[facility management]] by [[information technology]].&lt;ref name="What is Computer Aided Facility Management (CAFM) software"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planonsoftware.com/uk/glossary/cafm/ |title=What is Computer Aided Facility Management (CAFM) software? |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supply of information about the facilities is the center of attention. The tools of the CAFM are called CAFM software, CAFM applications or CAFM systems.

== History ==
The [[International Facility Management Association]] (IFMA) defines facility management as the practice of coordinating the physical workplace with the people and work of the organization. It integrates the principles of business administration, architecture and the behavioral and engineering sciences.&lt;ref name="What is FM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifma.org/what_is_fm/index.cfm |title=What is FM |author=International Facility Management Association |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, facility management has been practiced, whether specifically identified as its own discipline or not, since the inception of the business organization. It has evolved over the years through the development and codification of processes into a clearly defined field of expertise.

'''Customer attrition''', also known as '''customer churn''', '''customer turnover''', or '''customer defection''', is the loss of clients or customers.

[[Bank]]s, telephone service companies, [[Internet service provider]]s, [[pay TV]] companies, [[insurance]] firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their key business [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] (along with [[cash flow]], [[EBITDA]], etc.) because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/1990/09/zero-defections-quality-comes-to-services/ar/1 ''Zero Defections: Quality comes to service.''], Reichheld &amp; Sasser. Harvard Business review. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies from these sectors often have [[customer service]] branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients.

Companies usually make a distinction between '''voluntary churn''' and '''involuntary churn'''. Voluntary churn occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company or service provider, involuntary churn occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location. In most applications, involuntary reasons for churn are excluded from the analytical models. Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary churn, because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.

When companies are measuring their customer turnover, they typically make the distinction between '''gross attrition''' and '''net attrition'''. Gross attrition is the loss of existing customers and their associated [[recurring revenue]] for contracted goods or services during a particular period. Net attrition is gross attrition plus the addition or recruitment of similar customers at the original location. Financial institutions often track and measure attrition using a weighted calculation called '''Recurring Monthly Revenue''' (or '''RMR''').   In the 2000s, there are also a number of [[business intelligence]] software programs which can [[data mining|mine databases]] of customer information and analyze the factors that are associated with customer attrition, such as dissatisfaction with service or technical support, billing disputes, or a disagreement over company policies. More sophisticated [[predictive analytics]] software use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing [[customer retention]] marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.

[[Financial services]] such as banking and insurance use applications of [[predictive analytics]] for churn modeling, because customer retention is an essential part of most financial services' [[business model]]s. Other sectors have also discovered the power of predictive analytics, including [[retail]]ing, [[telecommunications]] and pay-TV operators. One of the main objectives of modeling customer churn is to determine the causal factors, so that the company can try to prevent the attrition from happening in the future. Some companies want to prevent their ''good'' customers from deteriorating (e.g., by falling behind in their payments) and becoming less profitable customers, so they introduced the notion of '''partial customer churn'''.

Customer attrition merits special attention by mobile telecom service providers worldwide. This is due to the low barriers to switching to a competing service provider especially with the advent of Mobile Number Portability (MNP) in several countries. This allows customers to switch to another provider while preserving their phone numbers. While mature markets with high teledensity (phone market penetration) have [[churn rate]]s ranging from 1% to 2% per month, high growth developing markets such as India and China are experiencing churn rates between 3% to 4% per month. By deploying new technologies such churn prediction models coupled with effective retention programs, customer attrition could be better managed to stem the significant revenue loss from defecting customers.

Customer attrition is a major concern for US and Canadian banks, because they have much higher churn rates than banks in Western Europe. US and Canadian banks with the lowest churn rates have achieved customer turnover rates as low as 12% per year, by using tactics such as free checking accounts, [[online banking]] and bill payment, and improved customer service. However, once banks can improve their churn rates by improving customer service, they can reach a point beyond which further customer service will not improve retention; other tactics or approaches need to be explored.

Churn or Customer attrition is often used as an indicator of customer satisfaction. However the churn rate can be kept artificially low by making it difficult for the customers to resiliate their services. This can include ignoring resiliations requests, implementing lengthy and complicated resiliation procedures to follow through by an average consumer and various other barriers to resiliation. Thus, churn can improve while customer satisfaction deteriorates. This practice is short sighted and will backfire. However, it was shown{{By whom|date=October 2017}} to be common in telephone companies and among internet providers.

==Research==
Scholars have studied customer attrition at European financial services companies, and investigated the predictors of churn and how the use of [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) approaches can impact churn rates. Several studies combine several different types of predictors to develop a churn model. This model can take [[Demography|demographic characteristics]], environmental changes, and other factors into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Customer Attrition Analysis For Financial Services Using Proportional Hazard Models | citeseerx = 10.1.1.62.8919 | author1 = Van Den Poel | author2 = Lariviére | journal = European Journal of Operational Research | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1016/s0377-2217(03)00069-9 | volume=157 | pages=196–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on customer attrition data modeling may provide businesses with several tools for enhancing customer retention. Using data mining and software, one may apply statistical methods to develop nonlinear attrition causation models. One researcher notes that "...retaining existing customers is more profitable than acquiring new customers due primarily to savings on acquisition costs, the higher volume of service consumption, and customer referrals." The argument is that to build an "...effective customer retention program," managers have to come to an understanding of "...why customers leave" and "...identify the customers with high risk of leaving" by accurately predicting customer attrition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/JCIM/bin/get.cgi?directory=vol6_1/&amp;filename=li.html ''Applying and evaluating models to predict customer attrition using data mining techniques''], Tom Au, et al. Journal of Comparative International Management. 1 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prediction==
In the [[business]] context, "churn" refers both to customers' migration and to their loss of value. So, "churn rate" refers, on the one hand, to the percentage of customers who end their relation with the organization, or, on the other hand, to the customers who still receive their services, but not as much or not as often as they used to.
Current organizations face therefore a huge challenge: to be able to anticipate to customers’ abandon in order to retain them on time, reducing this way costs and risks and gaining efficiency and competitivity.
There are in the market advanced analytics tools and applications, especially designed to analyze in depth the enormous amount of data inside the organizations, and to make predictions based on the information obtained from analyzing and exploring those data. They aim to put at the service of [[marketing]] departments and agencies –and of all business users- the necessary weapons to:
* Detect soon which customers are about to abandon and to know them in depth, answering to questions such as: Who are they? or How do they behave?
* Know the real value of the potential loss of those customers, with the aim of establishing priorities and distributing business efforts and resources efficiently, optimizing resources and maximizing the value of the current customers’ portfolio.
* Put into practice personalized retention plans in order to reduce or avoid their migration, increasing the capability to react and anticipating to possible non-predicted fugues.

==Reduction==
There are organizations that have developed international standards regarding recognition and sharing of global best practice in [[customer service]] in order to reduce customer attrition. [[The International Customer Service Institute]] has developed The International Customer Service Standard to strategically align organizations so they focus on delivering excellence in customer service, whilst at the same time providing recognition of success through a 3rd Party registration scheme.

==Management==
Not all customer attrition is bad. For many firms, it is useful and desirable that unprofitable customers should churn away. This is known as customer divestment of unprofitable customers.&lt;ref&gt;Ka‐shing Woo, Henry K.Y. Fock, (2004) Retaining and divesting customers: an exploratory study of right customers, “at‐risk” right customers, and wrong customers. ''Journal of Services Marketing, 18'', 187-197.&lt;/ref&gt; However, simply because a customer is unprofitable does not mean that the customer should be divested, because there are strategic reasons for retaining unprofitable customers.

'''Eliot Ward Higgins''' (born January 1979),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/CXZW53jimPQ9-c8pqoXHtbFOOEE/appointments |title=Eliott Ward Higgins |publisher=Companies House |author= |date= |accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who previously used the pseudonym '''Brown Moses''', is a British [[Citizen journalism|citizen journalist]] and [[blog]]ger, known for inaugurating open-sources and social media for investigations. He helped to investigate the [[Syrian Civil War]], [[2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]], the downing of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] and the [[Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]]. He first gained mainstream media attention by identifying weapons in uploaded videos from the Syrian conflict.&lt;ref name="Weaver"&gt;{{cite news |last=Weaver |first=Matthew |date=21 March 2013 |title=How Brown Moses exposed Syrian arms trafficking from his front room |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/21/frontroom-blogger-analyses-weapons-syria-frontline |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radden Keefe"&gt;{{cite news |last=Keefe |first=Patrick Radden |date=25 November 2013 |title=Rocket Man |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/25/rocket-man-2 |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founder of [[Bellingcat]], a website for citizen journalists to investigate current events using open-source information such as videos, maps and pictures.

==Life and work==
Higgins was born in [[Shrewsbury]] in January 1979.&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=I8I9vmlYyuiWSrzCRT26Hw&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=2 February 2018|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/CXZW53jimPQ9-c8pqoXHtbFOOEE/appointments |title=Eliot Ward HIGGINS |website=Personal Appointments |publisher=[[Companies House]] |access-date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams' Grammar School]] in [[Shropshire]] from 1990-95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.adamsgs.uk/our-community/alumni |title=Adams' Grammar School Alumni |publisher=Adams' Grammar School |author= |date= |accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His previous work history includes work in finance and admin.&lt;ref name="Bosker"/&gt; In 2012, when Higgins began blogging the Syrian civil war, he was unemployed and spent his days taking care of his child at home;&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; he is married to a Turkish woman.&lt;ref name="Bosker"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bosker |first=Bianca |date=18 November 2013 |title=Inside The One-Man Intelligence Unit That Exposed The Secrets And Atrocities Of Syria's War |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/18/eliot-higgins-syria_n_4269417.html |newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shubert"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shubert |first=Atika |author-link=Atika Shubert |date=1 April 2013 |title=In his living room, blogger traces arms trafficking to Syria |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/29/world/europe/syria-weapons-blogger |publisher=[[CNN International]] |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higgins took the pseudonym Brown Moses from the [[Frank Zappa]] song "Brown Moses" on the album ''[[Thing-Fish]]''.&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt;

Higgins' analyses of Syrian weapons, which began as a hobby out of his home in his spare time, are frequently cited by the press and human rights groups and have led to parliamentary discussion.&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; His Brown Moses Blog began in March 2012 by covering the Syrian conflict. Higgins operates by monitoring over 450 YouTube channels daily looking for images of weapons and tracking when new types appear in the war, where, and with whom.&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; According to ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' reporter Matthew Weaver, Higgins has been "hailed as something of a pioneer" for his work. Higgins has no background or training in weapons and is entirely self-taught, saying that "Before the Arab spring I knew no more about weapons than the average Xbox owner. I had no knowledge beyond what I'd learned from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rambo."&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; Higgins does not speak or read Arabic.&lt;ref name="Shubert"/&gt;

Higgins is credited with being among the first to report on the widespread use of improvised [[barrel bomb]]s by the Syrian government, a phenomenon which has spread to other troubled nations such as Iraq to combat insurgencies and opposition forces.&lt;ref name=higgins&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brown-moses.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-mystery-of-syrian-barrel-bombs.html |title=The Mystery of the Syrian Barrel Bombs |work=[[Brown Moses Blog]] |first=Eliot |last=Higgins |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marcus |first=Jonathan |date=20 December 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25466541 |title=Syria conflict: Barrel bombs show brutality of war |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other aspects of the Syrian conflict uncovered and documented by Higgins include the use of [[cluster bomb]]s in 2012, which the Syrian government previously denied using; the proliferation of shoulder-launched heat-seeking missiles known as [[MANPADS]]; and the proliferation of [[Croatia]]n-made weapons which was reportedly connected to the United States, a story later picked up by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; He has also investigated the Syrian regime's alleged use of chemical weapons, including the [[Ghouta chemical attack]] in detail.&lt;ref name="Burrell"&gt;{{cite news |last=Burrell |first=Ian |date=18 January 2015 |title=With Isis, Assad and Putin exposed, who's next on citizen journalist Eliot Higgins' list? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/with-isis-assad-and-putin-exposed-whos-next-on-citizen-journalist-eliot-higgins-list-9983831.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10730163/The-blogger-who-tracks-Syrian-rockets-from-his-sofa.html |title= The blogger who tracks Syrian rockets from his sofa| first=Patrick Radden |last= Keefe |date= 29 March 2014 |accessdate= 11 April 2015 |work= [[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higgins has also performed consulting work for groups such as [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref name="Bosker" / [[Theodore Postol]], a professor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and Richard Lloyd, a former UN weapons inspector, criticised some aspects of Higgins's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/mh-abschuss-ueber-ukraine-blogger-strafen-moskau-luegen-1.2502698-2|title=Ein-Mann-Nachrichtenagentur|trans-title=One man news agency|language=German|date=1 June 2015|work= [[Suddeutsche Zeitung]]|archiveurl=https://archive.is/S69ob|archivedate=23 September 2015|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higgins used [[geolocation]] to publish an estimate of where the [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]] execution video was made outside [[Raqqa]], an [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] stronghold in north-central Syria. Higgins used visual markers in stills from the video and his interpretation of satellite images of the terrain around Raqqa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11053544/Is-this-where-James-Foley-was-beheaded.html|title=Is this where James Foley was beheaded?|publisher=The Telegraph|author=Josie Ensor|date=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Higgins was a visiting research associate at the ''Centre for Science and Security Studies'' (CSSS) at the Department of War Studies at [[King’s College London]] and visiting research fellow at [[University of California Berkeley]]'s Human Rights Center.&lt;ref name="arselec" /&gt; In October of that year, Higgins was the subject of [[BBC Radio Four]]'s programme ''Profile''.&lt;ref name="BBC Profile"&gt;{{cite episode| title= Profile: Eliot Higgins| series= Profile| credits= Presenter: Mark Coles; Producer: Smita Patel; Researcher: Oliver Jones; Editor: Emma Rippon| network= BBC| station= [[BBC Radio Four]]| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0000qf4 | airdate= 14 October 2018| accessdate= 17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bellingcat==
{{main|Bellingcat}}
On 15 July 2014, Higgins began a new website called [[Bellingcat]] for [[citizen journalism|citizen journalists]] to investigate current events using open-source information such as videos, maps and pictures. Its launch was funded by a [[Kickstarter]] campaign.&lt;ref name=Kickstarter&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1278239551/bellingcat |title=Bellingcat, for and by citizen investigative journalists |last=Higgins |first=Eliot |publisher=[[Kickstarter]] |accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellingcat's self-taught open-source analysts include Higgins and eight volunteers.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite news |title=Meet Eliot Higgins, Putin’s MH17 Nemesis |url=http://www.newsweek.com/meet-eliot-higgins-putins-mh17-nemesis-345485 |work= [[Newsweek]] |first=Maxim |last=Tucker |date=22 June 2015 |accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among its major projects, Bellingcat has investigated the downing of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] in Ukraine. Its work is being considered by the [[Korps landelijke politiediensten|Dutch police]] investigating the crash,&lt;ref name="Burrell" /&gt; and Higgins has been interviewed twice by the investigators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/eliot-higgins-putin-syria_us_561fc877e4b028dd7ea6e15c?section=australia|title=The Citizen Journalists Challenging Assad And Putin's Story Of War|date=16 October 2015|last=Alfred|first=Charlotte|publisher=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellingcat has suggested that the anti-aircraft missile that hit the plane was fired by a Russian unit, the 53rd Buk brigade, based in the city of [[Kursk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work= The Guardian |date=8 September 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/08/malaysia-airlines-mh-17-dutch-safety-board-preliminary-report |first=Julian |last=Borger |accessdate=5 July 2015 |title=MH17: Dutch Safety Board to publish preliminary report on disaster}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 2015, Bellingcat released a report alleging among other things photo manipulation of satellite images released by the [[Russian Ministry of Defense]].&lt;ref name=mayMH17report&gt;{{cite web |title=Forensic Analysis of Satellite Images Released by the Russian Ministry of Defense: A bell¿ngcat Investigation |url=https://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Forensic_analysis_of_satellite_images_EN.pdf |date=30 May 2015 |publisher=Bellingcat |accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photos concerned the location of Ukrainian [[Buk missile system|Buk missile launchers]] around the time MH17 was shot down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MH17 – Forensic Analysis of Satellite Images Released by the Russian Ministry of Defence |url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/05/31/mh17-forensic-analysis-of-satellite-images-released-by-the-russian-ministry-of-defence/ |date=31 May 2015 |accessdate=22 June 2015 |publisher=Bellingcat}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bellingcat's use of [[error level analysis]] in its report was criticized by Jens Kriese, a professional image analyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Bellingcat Report Doesn't Prove Anything': Expert Criticizes Allegations of Russian MH17 Manipulation |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/expert-criticizes-allegations-of-russian-mh17-manipulation-a-1037125.html |date=June 4, 2015 |accessdate=June 22, 2015 |first=Benjamin |last=Bidder |work= [[Spiegel Online International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Bellingcat's findings about which field the missile was fired from were vindicated in September 2016 by the Dutch-led MH17 [[MH17#Criminal_investigation|Joint Investigation Team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Harding |first1=Luke |author-link1=Luke Harding |last2=Luhn |first2=Alec |date=28 September 2016 |title=MH17: Buk missile finding sets Russia and west at loggerheads |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/flight-mh17-shot-down-by-missile-brought-in-from-russia-ukraine-malaysia-airlines |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Atlantic Council==
Higgins is a senior fellow in the [[Digital Forensic Research Lab]] (since 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/experts/list/eliot-higgins|title=Eliot Higgins - Nonresident Senior Fellow, Digital Forensic Research Lab, Future Europe Initiative|website=Atlantic Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222070801/http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/experts/list/eliot-higgins|archivedate=22 February 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''Future Europe Initiative'', projects run by the [[Atlantic Council]], a leading US [[geopolitic]]al strategy think-tank based in Washington, D.C. 

In 2015, Higgins partnered with the [[Atlantic Council]] to co-author the report [http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/publications/reports/hiding-in-plain-sight-putin-s-war-in-ukraine-and-boris-nemtsov-s-putin-war Hiding in Plain Sight: Putin's War in Ukraine] which examined direct Russian military involvement in Ukraine. The report was the inspiration for the documentary [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zssIFN2mso Selfie Soldiers] in which [[Vice News]] correspondent [[Simon Ostrovsky]] followed digital traces left by a Russian soldier named Bato Dambaev who was sent to fight in Eastern Ukraine. In June 2015 on the invitation of former Belgium Prime Minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]], Higgins together with his report co-author [[Atlantic Council]]'s Maks Czuperski presented Hiding in Plain Sight at the [[European Parliament]] alongside Russian opposition figure [[Ilya Yashin]] and former Russian Prime Minister [[Mikhail Kasyanov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boris Nemtsov's "Putin.War" &amp; Atlantic Council's "Hiding in Plain Sight: Putin's War in Ukraine"|url=https://alde.livecasts.eu/eu-launch-boris-nemtsov-atlantic-council|website=Putin. War|publisher=ALDE Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Higgins was one of five authors of an Atlantic Council report released in 2016, “Distract, Deceive, Destroy,” on Russia’s role in Syria.&lt;ref name=dddreport&gt;{{cite web |title=DISTRACT, DECEIVE, DESTROY: Putin at War in Syria |url=http://publications.atlanticcouncil.org/distract-deceive-destroy/assets/download/ddd-report.pdf |date=April 2016 |publisher=Atlantic Council |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Higgins has received significant praise and support from human rights groups, journalists, and non-profit organisations. "Brown Moses is among the best out there when it comes to weapons monitoring in Syria," said Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; ''The New York Times'' war reporter [[C.J. Chivers]] said that fellow journalists owe a debt to Higgins' investigative reporting in Syria. "Many people, whether they admit or not, have been relying on that blog's daily labour to cull the uncountable videos that circulate from the conflict," he said.&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; [[Amnesty International]] said that the Brown Moses Blog was vital in proving the Syrian government was using ballistic missiles, information then used to send a research mission to Syria.&lt;ref name="O'Brien" /&gt;

Eliot Higgins has been a subject of interest for the British and U.S. media and is described described as "one of the world's foremost citizen journalists" by [[News Limited]] reporter Victoria Craw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/security/bellingcat-citizen-journalist-eliot-higgins-is-holding-global-governments-to-account/news-story/196436ab0cba6b6eea0a76c5f16af0a1|title=Bellingcat citizen journalist Eliot Higgins is holding global governments to account|author=Victoria Craw|publisher=news.com.au|date=29 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117140039/https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/security/bellingcat-citizen-journalist-eliot-higgins-is-holding-global-governments-to-account/news-story/196436ab0cba6b6eea0a76c5f16af0a1|archivedate=2015-11-17|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been profiled in print by ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'',&lt;ref name="Burrell" /&gt; ''[[The Huffington Post]]'',&lt;ref name="Bosker" /&gt; and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="Radden Keefe" /&gt; Television features have been run by [[Channel 4 News]]&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Brien |first=Paraic |date=30 March 2013 |title=Brown Moses: the British blogger tracking Syrian arms |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/brown-moses-blog-syria-arms-weapons-croatia |publisher=[[Channel 4 News]] |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CNN International]].&lt;ref name="Shubert" /&gt; He has also been covered by non-English sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brown-moses.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-brown-moses-blog-fundraiser-launches.html |title=The Brown Moses Blog Fundraiser Launches! |work=Brown Moses Blog |first=Eliot |last=Higgins |date=16 April 2013 |accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erik Børresen''' (17 September 1785 – 14 January 1860) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] ship owner, merchant and philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    https://snl.no/Erik_Andreas_B%25C3%25B8rresen|title = Erik Andreas Børresen|publisher =   Store norske leksikon
|author=Audun Grimstad|accessdate= July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Biography==
Erik Andreas Børresen as born in the [[Bragernes]] neighborhood of [[Drammen]] in [[Buskerud]], Norway. He was the son of Lars Børresen (1753-1810) and Karen Flor Robsahm (1764-1825). He followed in his father's footsteps and entered the timber trade. Initially he concentrated the shipping activities on the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Netherlands]]. He later established himself as a wholesaler of both lumber and grain.  During the 1830s, he built several ships in [[Hurum]] and later he established his own shipyard in Bragernes.  Børresen owned the first Norwegian ships to sail to [[China]]. By the 1840s, he had become the owner-operator of one of the largest shipping companies in Drammen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    https://nbl.snl.no/Erik_B%25C3%25B8rresen|title =  Erik Børresen|publisher =   Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=Geir Helgen|accessdate= July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Børresen participated in local politics and was elected to the [[Norwegian Parliament]] in 1827. Børresen was deputy in 1836, and was elected as a permanent representative to the parliamentary assembly in 1845. Børresen was elected to the first board of the Drammen stock exchange (''Drammens børs'') in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/index.php/Erik_Andreas_B%C3%B8rresen |title=  Erik Andreas Børresen|publisher =   lokalhistoriewiki.no

In 1813, he married Anne Hermine Schioldborg (1791-1855), daughter of agent Christian Anker Schioldborg (1768-1819) and Alethe Sophia Hammond (1772-1820). Their marriage was childless. At the time of his death, the bulk of his fortune he bequeathed to the Erik Børresen  Foundation (''Erik Børresens Stiftelse'') which first operated an orphanage and later an educational institution, now Børresen School (''Børresen skole'') on Hauges gate in Drammen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    http://www.artemisia.no/arc/historisk/drammen/hauges.gate.100.html|title =    Børresen skole, Hauges gate 100|publisher =    artemisia.no|accessdate= July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/index.php/B%C3%B8rresen_skole |title=  Børresen skole|publisher =   lokalhistoriewiki.no

==Biography==

===Invents rice and coffee peeler===

In 1885,&lt;ref name="patent"/&gt; while constructing a [[water wheel]], Engelberg observed a group of slaves stripping the [[Rice hulls|hulls from rice]] with [[Mortar and pestle|pestles]] by hand, the main method of cleaning rice at the time. Engelberg experimented with the method and found that by rubbing the rice between his fingers while applying pressure, the hulls were easily removed. He returned to his workshop and immediately began working on a machine that he finished the next day, thus creating the first horizontal cylinder rice "peeler." The invention was named the Engelberg Huller and soon was adapted to work with coffee. Once it made it to market, the device revolutionized the processing of coffee and rice throughout the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Brazilian manufacturing===

There was some initial resistance to the machine from ranchers and farmers in [[Brazil]], who preferred to use [[slave labor]] throughout the year for these and other processes, rather than investing the money in the machines invented by Engelberg, which would be useful only during harvest. Despite this initial resistance, the peelers was eventually adopted by major growers of the region. With the strong development of his business, in June 1885, Engelberg partnered with Earl Siciliano to found Engelberg &amp; Siciliano which was headquartered in Piracicaba.&lt;ref name="parisianacademy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aprovincia.com/padrao.aspx?texto.aspx?idContent=390215|title=Um piracicabano na Academia de Paris|accessdate=July 17, 2011|work=|publisher=A Provincia, October 11, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324142334/http://www.aprovincia.com/padrao.aspx?texto.aspx%3FidContent=390215|archivedate=March 24, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patents for coffee huller===

During 1885, Engelberg received a [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|British patent]] for a rice-hulling machine.&lt;ref name="patentbritish"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vintagemachinery.org/mfgindex/detail.aspx?id=294 |title=Engelberg, Inc. |accessdate=July 17, 2011|work=|publisher=Vintage Machinery, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years later, on December 27, 1888, Engelberg applied for a [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|United States patent]] on the coffee-hulling machine.&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.web-books.com/Classics/ON/B0/B701/42MB701.html |title=A Coffee Chronology |accessdate=July 17, 2011|work=|publisher=Webbooks, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. patent (number 424,602) for a rice-hulling machine, was granted on April 1, 1890.&lt;ref name="lipe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datamp.org/patents/search/xrefCompany.php?id=2465 |title=Patents for Engelberg Huller Co. |accessdate=July 17, 2011|work=|publisher=Directory of American Tool and Machinery Patents, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this machine, hulling and polishing, which removes different layers below the husk, could be done in several stages "during the same passage," a process that automated a manual task.&lt;ref name="animaltraction"/&gt;

In 1890, the ''Gazeta de Piracicaba'' reported that Engelberg was appointed a member of the Parisian Academy of Inventors, and awarded a gold medal for his invention. Engelberg patented several models of these machines in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. He enjoyed huge success, because the "stripper" did not squeeze the coffee beans, and removed all the straw while maintaining the beans' integrity, producing a higher yield for coffee growers. The maintenance of the machines was also quite simple and inexpensive, which was advantageous, because the main methods of cleaning the coffee still depended on slave labor in mills.&lt;ref name="parisianacademy"/&gt;

===U.S. manufacturing===

[[File:Engelbert 1904-03 huller.jpg|thumb|240px|right|A 1904 advertisement for the Engelberg Huller Company, [[Syracuse, New York]]]]

During 1888, as international demand for his machine increased, Engelberg partnered with José Tibiriçá to create a branch of his company in [[Syracuse, New York]], known as the [[Engelberg Huller Company]], which was organized for the purpose of manufacturing and selling the "Engelberg huller".&lt;ref name="patent"/&gt; in [[North America]]. The huller was quite successful, and additional patents were granted to the firm for various improvements over the years.&lt;ref name="patentbritish"/&gt;

Production in Brazil was halted in 1890 and by 1922, the machines produced in Syracuse began to be shipped and sold in Brazil, as well as other parts of [[South America]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Central America]].&lt;ref name="hulling"&gt;{{cite news |title=Inventions Built Industries Here |newspaper=[[Syracuse Herald Journal|Syracuse Journal]] |location=[[Syracuse, New York]] |date=March 20, 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some time during the twentieth century the [[Engelberg Huller Company]] began to make grinders plus belt and disk sanders, all intended primarily for metalworking. Some time between 1957 and 1971, the company name was shortened to Engelberg, Inc. and by 1971 the name was amended, to Sundstrand-Engelberg, Inc. of [[Liverpool, New York]]. During 1974, the name changed to Sundstrand Syracuse, Inc. of Syracuse, New York, and Sundstrand Corp. of Rockford, Illinois.&lt;ref name="patentbritish"/&gt;

===Invention still in use today===

By 1990, Engelberg hullers were still widely used in small mills for milling rice for local markets.&lt;ref name="animaltraction"/&gt; As of 2011, the Syracuse-based branch of the [[Engelberg Huller Company]] continues to produce hullers. The associated parts and the hullers are still in use in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name="patentbritish"/&gt;

{{japanese name|Furukawa}}
{{nihongo|'''Furukawa Ichibei'''|古河 市兵衛|extra=April 16, 1832 - April 5, 1903}} was a Japanese businessman who founded one of the fifteen largest industrial conglomerates in Japan, specializing in electrical goods, chemicals and metals.  He bought the [[Ashio copper mine]] from the Japanese government in 1877, which he later organized,  with his other holdings,  into an [[zaibatsu|industrial conglomerate]] called the [[Furukawa Group|Furukawa zaibatsu]], one of the most important in Japan.  Japanese companies today with the names "Furukawa" and "Fuji", often belong to this group.

==Biography==
Furukawa's school education began and ended before [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Perry]]'s ships entered Japanese waters. His parents were lower middle-class and could not afford to give him a higher education. It was about the time of the treaty that opened Japan to commerce with the United States and other civilized nations, that the strong traits manifested by the boy attracted the attention of a business man in his native town. He was adopted by an eccentric man named Furukawa Tarozaemon, who gave his adopted son some schooling in business. The stepfather and son had frequent but respectful differences of opinion, but in time the father realized that Furukawa was usually right and in time gave him free rein &amp;ndash; a Japanese instance of ''[[Fortiter in re suaviter in modo|fortiter in re, suaviter in modo]]''.&lt;ref name=gateway&gt;''Gateway'' Vol.1, No.3, p.5 (Oct. 1903)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commerce and foreign trade===
Furukawa made large profits in the raw silk trade, exporting his stock for foreign consumption. He also did well in the rice trade, while suffering severe losses at times - an early example of the vicissitudes of  commodities trading.&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

===Industry===
In spite of his successes in commerce, Furukawa felt the need to be directly involved with the working man. He yearned to be a captain of industry, desirous of expanding employment opportunities for his compatriots, as unemployment was a serious problem in Japan. He had aspirations similar to a few pioneering industrialists in the West who wished to improve the lot of the working man and to expand the demand for his services. He also had benevolent ideas on raising the standard of living for the working classes, espousing methods of making provision for old age, and suitable foundations to help toward that end.&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

The opportunity to fulfill his dream came about as the result of the failure of a Japanese firm, which has considerable consequence in the business of the empire. Furukawa had reflected upon the opportunities in mining. He bought out a failing copper mine and as he found [[mining]] to his liking, he bought another after a while. This second mine was old and had been worked for decades. It had always produced fairly, but was thought to be pretty well spent. Furukawa's purchase was laughed at by a few of the initiated and not even his own miners encouraged him in the venture. As operations in the mine improved under his ownership and management, it turned out to be one of the greatest mines of Japan, the now-famous [[Ashio Copper Mine]].&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

==== Copper ====
At greater depths, he found huge deposits of ore and production increased immensely. He used the great wealth he accumulated to establish his ideal industrial city in the mountains of Ashio. He built better homes for the miners, he installed schools for the young, he endowed hospitals, he built roads throughout the district, he provided instructive amusements for the working men, which was an unheard of thing in Japan at the time.&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

He lived among the miners so far as the outside demands of his business would permit; when away from them he was nothing more than a plain citizen of Tokyo. All the while he was extending his operations. He bought ten more mines of coal and of copper, in different districts of Japan. All of them prospered, and with their prosperity came a better share of the better things of life for the miners, and a great extension of fields of employment.&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

So huge was his wealth and influence that superstitious people began to believe that he might be a demon and that all his beneficence was simply a ploy to gain control over them. This was especially so among neighbouring communities who did not benefit directly from the wealth of the mines, in spite of the fact that the wealth of the whole region and nation benefited from it. When the enormous pollution from the mines began to affect the health of the inhabitants of the region, they felt that their suspicions were confirmed. After riots ensued, the government stepped in and demanded a remedy. In response, Furukawa built a  system of tunnels and canals to carry the industrial waste to a remote coast. The cost was great, but the work was completed under his own supervision in a short time. It was a triumph for the government and the people took it as an evidence that even the devil himself was no match for the imperial power of the Emperor.&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

===Later life===
Although Furukawa might be seen as patriarchal in his ideas, and his scheme of government as monarchal, his influence remains, and he is remembered in Japan as the highest example of a far-sighted, public-spirited man, who accomplished great things, and deserved his title of the "Copper King."&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

In his seventy-second year, the year prior to his death, he went to [[Korea]] to open a gold mine. He also had in mind great plans to open mines in [[China]], cut short by his death. His great wealth and ripe old age, did not cause him to slow down. He refused to listen to the remonstrances of his friends and relatives, and remained busy, and with his usual amazing success, until the end.&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

He first introduced machinery in the [[sericulture]] of Japan, thereby extending the production of silk. He preceded all others in the use of electric lights and power in his coal mines and he established the first [[coke oven]]s in Japan. He eagerly adopted all modern improvements, and was a good customer for American inventors and manufacturers.&lt;ref name=gateway/&gt;

'''Health technology assessment''' is the systematic evaluation of the properties and effects of a [[health technology]], addressing the direct and intended effects of this technology, as well as its indirect and [[unintended consequences]], and aimed mainly at informing decision making regarding health technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=INAHTA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment) | title=HTA Glossary.net | url=http://htaglossary.net/health+technology+assessment+%28HTA%29 | date=Jun 1, 2015 | publisher=INAHTA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has other definitions including "a method of evidence synthesis that considers evidence regarding clinical effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness and, when broadly applied, includes social, ethical, and legal aspects of the use of health technologies. The precise balance of these inputs depends on the purpose of each individual HTA. A major use of HTAs is in informing reimbursement and coverage decisions by [[Health insurance|insurers]] and national health systems, in which case HTAs should include benefit-harm assessment and economic evaluation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Luce BR, etal | title=. EBM, HTA, and CER: clearing the confusion | journal=Milbank Q | date=2010 | volume=88 | pages=256–76 | pmid=20579285 | pmc=2980346 | issue=2 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2010.00598.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and "a multidisciplinary process that summarises information about the medical, social, economic and ethical issues related to the use of a health technology in a systematic, transparent, unbiased, robust manner. Its aim is to inform the formulation of safe, effective, [[health policies]] that are patient focused and seek to achieve best value. Despite its policy goals, HTA must always be firmly rooted in research and the scientific method".&lt;ref&gt;EUnetHTA (European network for Health Technology Assessment) https://www.eunethta.eu/about-eunethta/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Health technology assessment is intended to provide a bridge between the world of research and the world of decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Battista, RN: ''The scientific basis of health services''. BMJ Publishing Group, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; HTA is an active field internationally and has seen continued growth fostered by the need to support management, clinical, and policy decisions. It has also been advanced by the evolution of evaluative methods in the social and applied sciences, including [[clinical epidemiology]] and [[Health economics|health economics]]. Health policy decisions are becoming increasingly important as the opportunity costs from making wrong decisions continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Menon D.| title=The internationalization of heath technology assessment | journal=IJTAHC | date=1996 | volume=12 | pages=45–51 | pmid=8690561 | last2=Marshall | first2=D | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; HTA is now also used in assessment of innovative medical technologies like telemedicine e.g. by use of the [[Model for assessment of telemedicine]] (MAST).

Health technology can be defined broadly as:
{{Quote|Any intervention that may be used to promote health, to prevent, diagnose or treat disease or for rehabilitation or long-term care. This includes the pharmaceuticals, devices, procedures and organizational systems used in health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=INAHTA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment). | title=HTA glossary. | url=http://htaglossary.net/tiki-index.php?page=health%20technology | date=Oct 8, 2013 | publisher=HTAi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
The growth of HTA internationally can be seen in the expanding membership of the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA), a non-profit umbrella organization established in 1993. Organizations and individuals involved in HTA research are also affiliated with societies such as the international societies HTAi and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research |url=https://www.ispor.org |website=ISPOR |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An international Masters program in health technology assessment and management, ULYSSES, is also offered.

==Health Technology Assessment by country==
===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom's [[National Institute for Health Research]] runs several research programmes which may be viewed as falling into the realm of Health Technology Assessment. Of particular note is the NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme, its longest running, which undertakes both conventional HTA in the form of Evidence Synthesis and modelling, and evidence generation with a large portfolio of pragmatic [[Randomized controlled trial|RCTs]] and [[Cohort study|cohort studies]].

Also in the UK, the Multidisciplinary Assessment of Technology Centre for Healthcare carries out HTA in collaboration with the health service, the NHS and various industrial partners.  MATCH is organised into four themes addressing key HTA topics including Health Economics, Tools for Industry, User Needs and Procurement and Supply chain.

'''The Hilton Cleveland Downtown Hotel''' '''''(HCDH)''''' is a [[skyscraper]] on the corner of [[Ontario Street]] and Lakeside Avenue along [[The Mall (Cleveland)|The Mall]] in [[downtown Cleveland]], Ohio, United States. It opened in 2016, has 600 rooms and stands 32 stories in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/architecture/index.ssf/2015/06/first_look_new_downtown_hilton.html|title=First look: new downtown Hilton offers stunning views of downtown, Lake Erie (photos)|work=Cleveland.com|accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of four Hilton properties in downtown Cleveland, the other three being [[Hilton Garden Inn (Cleveland)|Hilton Garden Inn]], the [[DoubleTree Hotel Cleveland]], and Hampton Inn.

The building was constructed under a partnership between the city of [[Cleveland]] and [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] for the purposes of attracting larger conventions to the city of Cleveland. The agreement was entered into under the first chief executive of Cuyahoga County, [[Ed FitzGerald]]'s administration and the three-term Cleveland mayor [[Frank G. Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/architecture/index.ssf/2015/04/hilton_downtown_cleveland_conv.html|title=Hilton Downtown Cleveland convention hotel is on track for completion in time for Republican National Convention|work=Cleveland.com|accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotel is the tallest and largest in the city. Previously, the largest hotel in the city was the [[Renaissance Cleveland Hotel]] which has 500 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Peter S. (29 April 1990). "Hotel Disasters Have Put Key Issue Under Fire". Los Angeles Times (latimes.com). Retrieved 2014-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first major hotel constructed in the city since the building of the [[Marriott at Key Center]] in 1991 at a height of 320 feet with 385 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;"Cleveland Marriott Downtown at Key Center". Emporis.com. Retrieved 2015-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The new Hilton is managed by Teri Agosta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20150120/FREE/150129975/teri-agosta-named-general-manager-of-the-600-room-hilton-cleveland|title=CrainsCleveland.com : Subscription Center|work=Crainscleveland.com|accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Impetus for hotel==
Following the completion of the new [[Global Center for Health Innovation]] and spurred by a tax over run that was raised by the county to construct that facility, the first chief executive of Cuyahoga County, [[Ed FitzGerald]] spearheaded the notion that the county needed to mount a hotel project to meet demand for bigger conventions that would overlook Cleveland simply because it no longer had a large enough hotel to accommodate over 500 guests at a time in one location.

This was due to the fact that back in the 1990s, the [[Stouffer's]] company (who owned the hotel at the time) renovated the 1000 room [[Hotel Cleveland]] at [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] (connected to the iconic [[Terminal Tower]]) down to just 500 rooms. Not many Clevelanders knew this, but tourist groups and convention planners certainly did. This had become something of a liability to the tourism of Cuyahoga County and Cleveland was no longer be considered a convention town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/cuyahoga-county/index.ssf/2014/12/11_things_ed_fitzgerald_will_be_remembered_for_in_cuyahoga_county.html|title=11 actions Ed FitzGerald, Cuyahoga County's first executive, will be remembered for|work=Cleveland.com|accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acknowledged that the Hilton Hotel project was instrumental in landing the [[2016 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrea-poe/republican-national-conve_2_b_10357560.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financing==
The Hotel cost $272 million.
The city of Cleveland passed legislation that led to the financing structure for the hotel in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/cityhall/index.ssf/2013/12/cleveland_city_council_passes.html|title=Cleveland City Council passes Convention Center Hotel financing plan, after all|work=Cleveland.com|accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cuyahoga County followed suit by passing approval for the project in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideastream.org/news/cuyahoga-county-oks-272-million-downtown-cleveland-hotel-projectr ]{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

The lead architect on the project was the Atlanta firm of [[Cooper Carry]]. The project is [[LEED certified]] and has an extensive use of glass to create three slender modern towers jutting up from a four-story concrete pedestal base. It contains a main and junior ballroom. The hotel is an homage to the visionary civic minded [[Daniel Burnham]] Cleveland [[Group Plan]] that was instituted in 1903, as per this fact the hotel's new bar is called the Burnham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coopercarry.com/project/hilton-cleveland-downtown/ |title=Hilton Cleveland Downtown |publisher=Cooper Carry |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The skyscraper was erected by the [[New York City]] firm [[Turner Construction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turnerconstruction.com/experience/project/656E/hilton-cleveland-downtown |title=Hilton Cleveland Downtown &amp;#124; Turner Construction Company |publisher=Turnerconstruction.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Infosys acquired [[Lodestone Management Consultants]], based out of Zurich, Switzerland for $350m USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbesindia.com/blog/technology/today-in-tech-lodestone-acquisition-tcs-infosys-labor-unions-in-it-firms-shibulal-on-strategy/ |publisher= Forbes|title= Today in Tech: Lodestone Acquisition - TCS, Infosys &amp; Cognizant; Labor Unions in IT firms; Shibulal on strategy|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lodestone increased the Infosys Consulting client base by nearly 200 companies across different industry segments, and at the time of acquisition, Infosys’ consulting and systems-integration business contributed to 31% of total revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/business/infosys-acquires-swiss-firm-lodestone-for-rs1925-crore/article3880535.ece|title= Infosys Acquires Swiss Firm Lodestone for rs.1925 Crore|publisher= The Hindu|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition brought on 850 new employees, with 750 being front-line consulting delivery professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/raywang/2012/09/10/news-analysis-infosys-buys-lodestone-for-350m/|title=News Analysis: Infosys Buys Lodestone for $350m|publisher= Forbes|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Infosys Ltd decided to  integrate Lodestone, at the time a subsidiary of Infosys, and the Management Consulting Services unit into the singular Infosys Consulting unit that resides within Infosys Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livemint.com/Companies/4LfVsa2ddSvjTaKYrLUPVI/Infosys-revamps-its-consulting-business.html|title=Infosys Revamps its Consulting Business|publisher= LiveMint|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbesindia.com/article/special/infosys-consolidates-consulting-business/39785/1|title= Infosys Consolidates Consulting Business|publisher= Forbes India|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Workers' Olympiads''' were an international sporting event arranged between 1925 and 1937 by [[Socialist Workers' Sport International]] (SASI). It was an organisation supported by [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties and [[International Federation of Trade Unions]]. Workers' Olympiads were an alternate event for the [[Olympic Games]]. The participants were members of various labor sports associations and came mostly from Europe.&lt;ref name=lib&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/story/2012/08/01/workers-olympics |title= A workers' Olympics? |publisher= Workers' Liberty |date=1 August 2012 | language = |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays [http://www.csit.tv/en/world-sports-games the CSIT World Sports Games] are the successor sports events of the International Workers' Olympiads. The "World Sports Games" is the main highlight and a new Brand of the [[International Workers and Amateurs in Sports Confederation|CSIT]]. It is a unique major sports event for thousands of workers and amateurs every two years. [[International Workers and Amateurs in Sports Confederation|The CSIT (International Workers and Amateurs in Sports Confederation)]] is an international Multi-Sports Organization.

== History ==
[[File:Opening march 1931 Vienna.JPG|thumb|Opening march of the 1931 Workers' Olympiad in Vienna.]]
The Workers' Olympiads were created as a counterweight for the Olympic Games, which were criticized for being confined for the upper social classes and privileged people. The international workers' sports movement did not believe that the true Olympic spirit could be achieved in an Olympic movement dominated by the aristocratic leadership. [[Pierre de Coubertin]], founder of the [[International Olympic Committee]], had always opposed women's participation and supported the cultural superiority of white Europeans over other races. His followers, [[Henri de Baillet-Latour]] and [[Avery Brundage]], were openly anti-semitic and both collaborated with the Nazis. On the contrary, the Workers' Olympiads opposed all kinds of chauvinism, sexism, racism and social exclusiveness. The Olympic Games were based in rivalry between the nations, but the Workers' Olympiads stressed internationalism, friendship, solidarity and peace.&lt;ref name=riordan&gt;Riordan, James: ″Sport, Politics, and Communism″, p. 38–40. Manchester University Press, 1991. {{ISBN|978-071-90285-0-2}}. [https://books.google.fi/books?id=Rc1RAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=1921+olympiad+prague&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qmua0exF57&amp;sig=OYtYQPyvi6_UKl2nqH2hz3z6wpk&amp;hl=fi&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m9BjVaTNFYqesAHd0YHQBg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lucerne Sport International]] (later known as Socialist Workers' Sport International) was established in [[Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]] in 1920. The first unofficial Workers' Olympiads were held a year later in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. The IOC had banned the losing side of the [[World War I]] from the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] (Germany even from the 1924 games), but the Workers's Olympiads were open for the "enemy" side as well. The number of participating countries was thirteen. The first official Worker's Olympiads were the 1925 winter games in the [[Germany|German]] town of [[Schreiberhau]], which today is a part of [[Poland]]. They were followed by the first Summer Olympiads in [[Frankfurt am Main]].&lt;ref name=riordan/&gt; 

National flags were not used, but a red flag of international workers' movement.&lt;ref name=lib/&gt; The best athletes were awarded with diplomas, they did not receive medals like in the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.helsinki.fi/shentila/files/2005/04/TUL_ja-kansainv%C3%A4linen.pdf Hentilä, Seppo: ″Työväen Urheiluliitto ja kansainvälinen työläisurheilu″] (in Finnish). University of Helsinki. Retrieved 1 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The visiting athletes stayed mostly at private accommodation of local families.&lt;ref name=lib/&gt;

International Workers' Olympiads were more than just a games for the top athletes. The festival was based on a mass participation, it did not restrict entry on the grounds of sporting ability. [[1931 Workers' Summer Olympiad]] in [[Vienna]] was the largest event with the participation of 100,000 athletes from 26 countries. The Vienna Workers' Olympiad attracted some 250,000 spectators. It was much bigger event than the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] at [[Los Angeles]], both in number of participants as well as spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vcn.bc.ca/outlook/library/articles/jewsontheleft/p05SocialistSports.htm Roni Gechtman: "Socialist Sports in Yiddish – The Bundist Sport Organization Morgnshtern in Interwar Poland".] Retrieved 2 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Praterstadion]] (now Ernst-Happel-Stadion) was constructed between 1929 and 1931 for the 1931 Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wien.gv.at/freizeit/sportamt/annodazumal/sportstaetten/stadion.html |title= Wiener Praterstadion - Ernst-Happel-Stadion - Historische Sportstätte der Stadt Wien |publisher= City of Vienna |date= | language = German|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Workers' Olympiad at [[Antwerp]] in 1937 was a joint event with the [[Red Sport International]] organized [[Spartakiads]].&lt;ref&gt;John Nauright &amp; Charles Parrish (ed.): "Sports Around the World – History, Culture and Practice" (p. 463).

'''Jay Scott Pike''' (September 6, 1924 – September 13, 2015) was an American [[comic book artist]] and [[commercial illustrator]] known for his 1950s and 1960s work for [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics]], advertising art, and as a [[good girl art]]ist. He created the DC character [[Dolphin (comics)|Dolphin]] and co-created the Marvel character [[Jann of the Jungle]].

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, on September 6, 1924,&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; Jay Scott Pike enrolled at the [[Art Students League]] in [[Manhattan]], New York City at what he said was age 15 or 16: "I know I was partway into high school. I wasn't a junior or senior yet."&lt;ref name=stroud&gt;Pike in {{cite web|last=Stroud |first=Bryan, ed. |title=Jay Scott Pike |url=http://www.wtv-zone.com/silverager/interviews/pike.shtml |publisher=(Interview) The Silver Age Sage |date=2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yC5yA2Vt?url=http://www.wtv-zone.com/silverager/interviews/pike.shtml |archivedate=April 24, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After military service in the [[United States Marines]] from 1942 to 1946,&lt;ref name=stroud /&gt; he went on to study at the [[Parsons School of Design]] on [[GI Bill]] for one year, then [[Syracuse University]] for a semester, and, after his marriage in 1948, the [[Ringling School of Art]] in [[Sarasota, Florida]], for a year-and-a-half.&lt;ref name=stroud /&gt; Afterward, he and his wife moved to northern [[New Jersey]]. After meeting [[comic-book]] artist, [[Al Hartley]], "I went into drawing comics with Al, but we just didn't get along, so by the time we decided to split I'd gotten to know [editor] [[Stan Lee]]" at [[Marvel Comics]]' 1950s precursor, [[Atlas Comics]], "and Stan said that he would give me work of my own."&lt;ref name=stroud /&gt;
[[File:Showcase 79.png|thumb|left|The [[DC Comics]] character [[Dolphin (comics)|Dolphin]], created by Pike in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #79 (Dec. 1968). Cover art by Pike.]]
His earliest confirmed comic book art is the five-page story "The Living Dead", by an unknown writer, in ''[[Adventures into Terror]]'' #3 (April 1951), from [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s forerunner of [[Marvel Comics]]. Tentative earlier credits exist,&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/credit/name/jay%20scott%20pike/sort/chrono/ Jay Scott Pike] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atlastales&gt;[http://www.atlastales.com/cr/22/n:22:z:a:o:4:d:ASC:p:1 Jay Scott Pike] at AtlasTales.com. [https://www.webcitation.org/5vcuBN7lR?url=http://www.atlastales.com/cr/22/n:22:z:a:o:4:d:ASC:p:1 Archived] from the original on January 10, 2011..&lt;/ref&gt; but because it was not standard practice during this period to list complete writer/artist comic-book credits, confirmation is difficult. The interior art to "Captain Chaos" in the November 1952 issue of the magazine "Planet Stories" is credited to "J.S. Pike".

===Comic books===
Pike quickly became a regular Atlas Comics contributor, drawing in a variety of genres for such titles as the [[Western comics|Westerns]] ''[[Black Rider (comics)|Black Rider]]'', ''[[Red Warrior]]'', ''[[Texas Kid]]'', and ''[[Wild Western]]'';&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; such [[crime comics]] as ''All True Crime Cases Comics'', ''Amazing Detective Cases'', ''Crime Must Lose'', and ''Justice'';&lt;ref name=atlastales /&gt; [[romance comics]], including ''[[Girl Confessions]]'', ''[[Love Romances]]'', ''Love Tales'', ''My Own Romance'', ''Secret Story Romance'', and ''True Secrets'';&lt;ref name=atlastales /&gt; [[war comics]] such as ''Battle'', ''Battlefield'', ''Battlefront'', ''[[Combat Casey]]'', ''Men's Adventures'', ''Men in Action'', and ''War Action'';&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; and [[horror comics]] including ''Adventures into Weird Worlds'', ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'', ''[[Mystic (Atlas Comics)|Mystic]]'', and ''[[Uncanny Tales (comics)|Uncanny Tales]]'';&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; and [[jungle]] adventure such as  ''[[Jungle Tales]]'', and ''[[Lorna, the Jungle Girl]]'',&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;&lt;ref name=atlastales /&gt; among other comics. With writer [[Don Rico]], he co-created the character [[Jann of the Jungle]] in ''Jungle Tales'' #1 (Sept. 1954),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/11556/ ''Jungle Tales'' #1 (Sept. 1954)] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt; and drew her adventures in numerous issues of that title and her own series.

He recalled that soon after entering comics, the self-censorship [[Comics Code Authority]] impacted on his art. "I was drawing jungle girl comics: ''Jann of the Jungle'' and ''Lorna the Jungle Queen'' and it seems like another one, too, and I can remember I got a whole book back and had to make the bosoms smaller on the jungle girl, whichever one it was, and when she was flying through the trees on a vine or something her skirt couldn't go above her knees.  I can remember having to go over the whole book and having to fix those things."&lt;ref name = stroud /&gt;

His final Atlas/Marvel works were the six-page story "When a Romance Ends" in ''[[Love Romances]]'' #87 (May 1960), and the five-page "Love or Infatuation?", written by [[Stan Lee]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlastales.com/sI/1966 ''Love Romances'' #105 (May 1963)] at AtlasTales.com&lt;/ref&gt; years later in issue #105 (May 1963).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; Many of Pike's 1950s Atlas stories were reprinted by Marvel Comics in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

Pike began drawing for rival [[DC Comics]] in the mid-1960s, beginning with the 12-page story "In the Name of Love", starring Wendy Winthrop, Television Model, by an unknown writer, in ''Girls' Romances'' #99 (March 1964). He primarily drew for the publisher's romance comics, including ''[[Heart Throbs]]'', ''Our Love Story'', ''Secret Hearts'', and ''Young Love''.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; For ''Heart Throbs'', Pike and inker [[Russ Jones]] illustrated the feature "3 Girls—Their Lives—Their Loves," which ran from 1966–1970.

In addition to his DC romance work, Pike as both writer and artist created the undersea superheroine [[Dolphin (comics)|Dolphin]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #79 (Dec. 1968).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/22378/#158813 ''Showcase'' #79 (Dec. 1968)] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; His stories continued to appear in DC Comics through ''Girls' Love Stories'' #180 (Dec. 1973).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;
[[File:JayScottPikePinup.jpg|thumb|"Dog Tied", a [[pinup]] by Pike (signed) for the A. Fox calendar company]]

===Later career===
By the early 1960s, Pike was drawing covers for such magazines as ''Master Detective''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulpinternational.com/pulp/keyword/Jay+Scott+Pike.html |title=(signed) |website== Pulp International |first=Teresita, ed. |last=Domingo |date=December 1, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2013 |archivedate=December 8, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208201205/http://www.pulpinternational.com/pulp/keyword/Jay%2BScott%2BPike.html |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also is known for his [[good girl art]] [[pinup]] work, including for the A. Fox calendar company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Pin-Up Art of Jay Scott Pike, Vol. 1 | publisher = SQP | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0865621299 | first= Jay Scott | last = Pike }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an advertising artist, he worked on campaigns for clients including [[Borden (company)|Borden]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[General Mills]], [[Pepsi]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], and [[Trans World Airlines]].&lt;ref name=lam&gt;[http://lambiek.net/artists/p/pike_jay-scott.htm Jay Scott Pike] (headline only misspelled "Jac Scott Pike") at the [[Lambiek Comiclopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/5vcupDhzJ?url=http://lambiek.net/artists/p/pike_jay-scott.htm Archived] from the original on January 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As well, he said in 2010, "I did do some [painted] nudes that [[Playboy]] had in their resorts and those were sold for me for a while.  It didn't last too long because it came down from Playboy headquarters in [[Chicago]] that they didn't want any more artwork. Only photographs of the [[Playboy Playmate|Playmates]]."&lt;ref name = stroud /&gt;

After a long hiatus from comic books, Pike returned in 1993 to draw layouts for two issues and then do full [[penciler|penciling]] for an issue on the [[DC Comics]] series ''[[Scarlett (DC Comics)|Scarlett]]'' #12–14 (Dec. 1993 – Feb. 1994).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; He also penciled the 58-page story "All Good Things" in DC's [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation (comics)|Star Trek: The Next Generation The Series Finale]]'' (1994)&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

==Personal life==
Pike was living in [[Sarasota, Florida]], and married 67 years to his wife Margi at the time of his death on September 13, 2015. The couple had six children.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/heraldtribune/obituary.aspx?n=jay-scott-pike&amp;pid=175888642&amp;fhid=24369 |title=Jay Scott Pike Obituary |date=September 20–21, 2015 |work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |location=Florida |accessdate=September 22, 2015 |archivedate=September 22, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bjZYfPbe?url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/heraldtribune/obituary.aspx?n=jay-scott-pike |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Karolinska Institute''' ('''KI'''; {{lang-sv|Karolinska Institutet}};&lt;ref&gt;Karolinska Institutets Varumärkesplattform (Swedish) Revised Nov 2014, Page 20 https://internwebben.ki.se/sites/default/files/regler_vmplattform_nov2014_4_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes known as the '''(Royal) Caroline Institute''' in English&lt;ref&gt;''Nobel Foundation Directory''.  2003. Stockholm : Nobel Foundation, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Council of Science Museums. 2005. ''Nobel Prize Winners in Pictures with CD-ROM''. Delhi: Foundation Books, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Medical school|medical university]] in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]] within the [[Stockholm urban area]] of [[Sweden]]. It is recognised as Sweden's best university and one of the largest, most prestigious [[medical universities]] in the world. The [[Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute]] awards the Nobel Prize in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]]. The assembly consists of fifty professors from various medical disciplines at the university. The current [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of Karolinska Institute is [[Ole Petter Ottersen]], who took office in August 2017.

The Karolinska Institute was founded in 1810 on the island of [[Kungsholmen]] on the west side of [[Stockholm]]; the main [[campus]] was relocated decades later to Solna, just outside [[Stockholm Municipality|Stockholm]].  A second campus was established more recently in [[Flemingsberg]], [[Huddinge Municipality|Huddinge]], south of Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;http://ki.se/en/about/ki-through-the-centuries retrieved: 8 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Karolinska Institute is consistently ranked among the top medical universities internationally in a number of ranking tables.

The Karolinska Institute is Sweden's third oldest medical school, after [[Uppsala University]] (founded in 1477) and [[Lund University]] (founded in 1666). It is one of Sweden's largest centres for training and research, accounting for 30% of the medical training and more than 40% of all academic medical and life science research conducted in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ki.se/en/research/research-at-karolinska-institutet|title=Research at Karolinska|access-date=14 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313035349/http://ki.se/en/research/research-at-karolinska-institutet|archive-date=13 March 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Karolinska University Hospital]], located in Solna and Huddinge, is associated with the university as a research and teaching hospital. Together they form an [[academic health science centre]]. While most of the medical programs are taught in Swedish, the bulk of the [[Ph.D.]] projects are conducted in English. The institute's name is a reference to the [[Caroleans]].

== History ==

[[File:Gamla Karolinska Instututet 01.JPG|250px|thumb|Original Caroline Institute buildings at street ''Hantverkargatan'' in Kungsholmen, Stockholm]]

===19th century ===
The Karolinska Institute was founded by King [[Karl XIII]] on 13 December 1810 as an "academy for the training of skilled army surgeons" after one in three soldiers wounded in the [[Finnish War|Finnish War against Russia]] died in field hospitals. Indeed, a report of the time came to the conclusion that "the medical skills of the army barber-surgeons are manifestly inadequate, so Sweden needs to train surgeons in order to better prepare the country for future wars." Just one year later, in 1811, the Karolinska Institute was granted license to train not only surgeons but medical practitioners in general.

[[Image:Kungsholmens glasbruk 1865.jpg|thumb|left|The institute's original building as it appeared in the early 1860s]]
As one of KI's first professors, [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] laid the foundations of the newly inaugurated institute's scientific orientation, which in  1816 is granted the name ''Carolinska Institutet'' (in reference to the [[Caroleans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Risling M, Bellander BM, Cullheim S |title=Traumatic injuries in the nervous system |journal=Front Neurol |volume=3 |issue= |pages=26 |year=2012 |pmid=22375136 |pmc=3285774 |doi=10.3389/fneur.2012.00026}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This name, however, didn't really make an impact at the time and so was expanded to ''Carolinska Medico Chirurgiska institutet'', which proved more popular, especially when preceded by the epithet ''Kongliga'' (Royal), as introduced in 1822. This original institute was situated in the Royal Bakery on [[Riddarholmen]] (a small but central island in Stockholm) and within a just a couple of years had grown to encompass four professorships in anatomy, natural history and pharmacy, theoretical medicine and practical medicine (internal medicine and surgery).

At around the same time Anders Johan Hagströmer, a professor of anatomy and surgery from the Collegium Medicum (the National Board of Health and Welfare of its day), was appointed the institute's first inspector, a post equivalent to today's president. In the same year, the institute moved to the old Glasbruk quarter on Norr Mälarstrand, beside what is now the City Hall. The move across the waters of [[Riddarfjärden]] was accomplished with the help of barges, one of which is said to have capsized, consigning parts of Hagströmer's collection of preparations to the lake bed. Despite this his library survives intact and today forms part of the KI-Swedish Society of Medicine museum at the institute's Hagströmer Library.

[[Image:Widerström, Karolina ur Cederschöld; En banbryterska (1913).jpg|upright|thumb|In 1884 [[Karolina Widerström]] became the first woman to obtain a degree from the Karolinska Institute.]]
In 1861 the institute reached a significant milestone in being awarded the right to confer its own degrees; as such it was granted a status equal to that of a university. This, in turn, led to an increase in the size of the student body, necessitating the demolition of the old building on the Glasbruk plot and its replacement with a new, larger one. This new institute building was built in stages, mostly during the 1880s and into the first decade of the 20th century; it stands to this day, and has remained largely unchanged since its opening.

[[Image:Caroline Institute 1906 Stockholm.jpg|thumb|left|The Karolinska Institute's main building in 1906]]
Although it had already gained the right to confer general degrees, KI wasn't licensed to confer medical degrees until 1874. Previously, even though the institute could run courses in medicine, the right to confer medical degrees was almost exclusively that of Uppsala University. Following on from this change in the institute's status the first doctoral thesis was defended at KI by Alfred Levertin, on the subject of "Om Torpa Källa". Just shortly thereafter the Medical Students' Union was formed.

The next decade was one of firsts. By 1880 the Karolinska Institute had started to accept women and so it was in 1884 that [[Karolina Widerström]] became the first woman to obtain a bachelor's degree in medicine from the institute; she later went on to obtain a Licentiate degree in medicine and chose to specialise in women's medicine and gynaecology. [[Anna Stecksén]] later became the first woman to obtain a doctorate from the university.

Just five years later, following the death of [[Alfred Nobel]] in 1895, the Karolinska Institute received the right to select the recipient of the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physiology or Medicine. Since then, this assignment has given the Karolinska Institute a broad contact network in the field of medical science. Indeed, over the years, five of the institute's own researchers have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

===20th century ===
[[File:Karolinska February 2013 03.jpg|thumb|KI Campus in [[Solna]]. [[Karolinska University Hospital]] is seen in the background.]]
By 1930 the Swedish parliament had decided that a new teaching hospital was needed and resolved to build the new facility at Norrbacka in the [[Solna]] area of Stockholm. The hospital was, from the start, planned to have its theoretical and practical functions side by side, essentially signalling the start of the KI's move to the new site. The chief architect appointed to design the building, later to be named the Karolinska Hospital after a proposal by the Karolinska Institute, was [[Carl Westman]]. Westman worked tirelessly on this project, allowing for completion of the main hospital building by 1940. The hospital was officially opened in the same year along with the new Department of Public Health, KI's first building co-located with the hospital complex, and by 1945 KI moved the last of its departments from Kungsholmen to the Norrbacka site, known to current students and staff as the institute's Solna Campus.

The Karolinska Institute was initially slow to adopt social change. Nanna Svartz became the Karolinska Institute and  Sweden's first state-employed female professor in 1937; she was the only female academic of this rank until Astrid Fagréus became the institute's second female professor almost thirty years later in 1965. However, by the mid-twentieth century student revolts were taking place regularly in the pursuit of greater social equality. It was in response to the largest of these revolts in 1968 that the name of the institute was shortened to the current form ''Karolinska Institutet'', or ''KI''.

[[File:John's University (5540460707) (2).jpg|left|thumb|Campus in [[Huddinge]]]]
By the early 1970s the Huddinge Hospital became increasingly affiliated with the institute and, as more and more of the Karolinska Institute's departments start to move into the hospital buildings, the area developed to become what is KI's Huddinge campus today. It was here that the medical information centre for computer-based citation research (MIC) was set up, making the Karolinska Institute the first [[MEDLARS]] (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System) Centre outside the United States. Similarly innovative work continued at the institute throughout the 1970s, with Sweden's first [[toxicology]] programme commencing at KI in 1976 and the establishment of a [[psychotherapy]] course in 1979. Furthermore, in 1977 the Stockholm Institute of Physiotherapy closed, with the study programme transferring to a new [[physiotherapy]] department at KI.

[[File:Karolinska institutet juni 2013.jpeg|thumb|The institute's campus in Solna]]
In 1982 the Huddinge campus was expanded with the addition of the Novum Research Centre for the study of [[biotechnology]], oral biology, nutrition and toxicology, and [[structural biology|structural biochemistry]]. The number of departments was reduced from 150 to 30 in 1993 and programmes in optometry, biomedicine, and dental technology commenced. The other key feature of the 1990s was the institute's increasingly ambitious plans for commercialisation, as a result of which 'Karolinska Institutet Holding AB' and 'Karolinska Innovations AB' were formed to help the institute intensify its relations with the business community and facilitate scientists' attempts to commercialise their discoveries.

The year 1997 marked a major point in the history of the Karolinska Institute as it was finally granted official university status with a stated mission to "contribute to the improvement of human health through research, education and information". This newly acquired status later led to the incorporation of the Stockholm University of Health Sciences into KI, as a result of which seven new study programmes in occupational therapy, audionomy, midwifery, biomedical laboratory science, nursing, radiology nursing and dental hygiene, were added to KI's teaching portfolio. Around the same time the institute's public health science programme commenced bringing the total number of study programmes to nineteen. Similarly, by this point the institute possessed three student unions: The Medical Students' Union, the Dental Students' Union, and the Physiotherapy Students' Union.

===21st century ===
[[File:Aula Medica, Karolinska Institutet (8960275188).jpg|thumb|The Karolinska Institute's new lecture hall complex, Aula Medica]]

With the turn of the millennium the Karolinska Institute sought to strengthen its activities in the field of external education and research, forming dedicated companies to help it do so and later establishing a fundraising campaign with a target of raising an extra 1 billion kronor for research between 2007 and 2010. During the same period new programmes were established in [[medical informatics]], [[podiatry]], and [[psychology]] as well as master's programmes of one and two years duration, and in 2004, the Karolinska Institute appointed its first female president – Harriet Wallberg-Henriksson, professor of integrative physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ki.se/en/about/ki-through-the-centuries|title=KI through the centuries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 2010 marked yet another significant event in the history of the KI as the institute celebrated its 200th anniversary under the patronage of King [[Carl XVI Gustaf]]. Shortly thereafter, in 2013, Anders Hamsten assumed his new position as vice-chancellor of the Karolinska Institute, a position he held until when he resigned as in the wake of the [[Paolo Macchiarini#Allegations of research misconduct|Macchiarini affair]].&lt;ref name="Hamsten_resignation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anders Hamsten steps down as Vice-Chancellor of Karolinska Institutet|url=http://ki.se/en/news/anders-hamsten-steps-down-as-vice-chancellor-of-karolinska-institutet|website=Karolinska Institutet|accessdate=13 February 2016|date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seal's symbolism==

===Rod of Asclepius===
[[File:Karolinska Institutet seal.svg|right|200px]]
The rod of Asclepius is named after the god of medicine, [[Aesculapius]] or Asclepius. This ancient god was the son of Apollo and was generally accompanied by a snake. Over time, the snake became coiled around the staff borne by the god.

===Snake bowl===

The snake bowl was originally depicted together with Asclepius' daughter, the virgin goddess of health [[Hygieia]] or Hygiea. The snake ate from her bowl, which was considered to bring good fortune. There is nothing to support the notion that the snake would secrete its venom into the bowl.

===Cockerel===

The [[cockerel]] symbolises new life and was sacrificed to Asclepius by those who had recovered from illness. This is the meaning behind the Greek philosopher [[Socrates]]' last words after he drank the poisoned cup: "Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius. Do pay it. Don't forget."

==Education==
[[File:Medicinska Föreningen i Solna 20060723.jpg|250px|thumb|Building of the Medical Students' Union ''Medicinska Föreningen'']]
The Karolinska Institute offers the widest range of medical education under one roof in Sweden. Several of the programmes include clinical training or other training within the healthcare system. The close proximity of the Karolinska University Hospital and other teaching hospitals in the Stockholm area thus plays an important role during the education.
Approximately 6,000 full-time students are taking educational and single subject courses at Bachelor and Master levels at the Karolinska Institute. Annually, 20 upper high school students from all over Sweden get selected to attend Karolinska's 7-week long biomedical summer research school, informally named "SoFo".

The university was a founding member of the [[League of European Research Universities]]. 

=== Hong Kong donation controversy ===
In February 2015, the KI announced it had received a record $50 million donation from Lau Ming-wai, who chairs Hong Kong property developer [[Chinese Estates Holdings]], and would establish a research centre in the city. Within a few days, ''[[Next Magazine (Chinese magazine)|Next Magazine]]'' revealed that Chuen-yan &amp;ndash; son of Hong Kong Chief Executive [[CY Leung]] &amp;ndash; had recently been awarded a fellowship to research heart disease therapeutics at the institute in Stockholm beginning that year, and raised questions about the "intricate relationship between the chief executive and powerful individuals". CY Leung had visited KI when in Sweden in 2014, and subsequently introduced KI president, Anders Hamsten, to Lau.&lt;ref name=universityworldnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=2015021809361212|title=Karolinska's Asia campus donation questioned - University World News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=4&amp;art_id=154377&amp;sid=43908462&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20150217&amp;fc=4 "CY denies link over son's job and $400m donation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226092553/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=4&amp;art_id=154377&amp;sid=43908462&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20150217&amp;fc=4 |date=26 February 2015 }}. ''The Standard'', 17 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] urged the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|ICAC]] to investigate the donation, suggesting that Leung may have abused his public position to further his son's career. The Chief Executive's Office strenuously denied suggestions of any quid pro quo, saying that "the admission of the [Chief Executive's] son to post-doctoral research at KI is an independent decision by KI having regard to his professional standards. He [the son] plays no role and does not hold any position at the [proposed] Ming Wai Lau Center for Regenerative Medicine."&lt;ref name=universityworldnews/&gt; This accusation has also been questioned by the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'''s Canadian-based pro-Beijing and pro-government opinion columnist, Alex Lo: "The insinuation is that Leung Chuen-yan with a doctorate from Cambridge doesn't deserve his job at the Karolinska Institute...Leung the son probably could get similar junior posts in many other prestigious-sounding – at least to brand-obsessed Hongkongers – research institutes; it's not that big a deal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/technology/article/1720569/next-magazine-misses-mark-saying-money-influence-behind-leung "Next Magazine misses the mark in saying money, influence behind Leung Chuen-yan getting post at Karolinska Institute"].

==Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute==
[[File:Nobel PressConf GKHansen NTNU1147 (15773258580) (2).jpg|250px|thumb|Press Conference for the Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine 2014, held at the Karolinska Institute]]
{{main article|Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute}}
The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute is a body at the Karolinska Institute which awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Nobel Assembly consists of fifty professors in medical subjects at the Karolinska Institute, appointed by the faculty of the Institute, and is a private organisation which is formally not part of the Karolinska Institute. The main work involved in collecting nominations and screening nominees is performed by the Nobel Committee at the Karolinska Institute, which has five members. The Nobel Committee, which is appointed by the Nobel Assembly, is only empowered to recommend laureates, while the final decision rests with the Nobel Assembly.

In the early history of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which was first awarded in 1901, the laurates were decided upon by the entire faculty of the Karolinska Institute. The reason for creating a special body for the decisions concerning the Nobel Prize was the fact that the Karolinska Institute is a state-run university, which in turn means that it is subject to various laws that apply to government agencies in Sweden and similar Swedish public sector organisations, such as freedom of information legislation. By moving the actual decision making to a private body at Karolinska Institute (but not part of it), it is possible to follow the regulations for the Nobel Prize set down by the Nobel Foundation, including keeping the confidentiality of all documents and proceedings for a minimum of 50 years. Also, the legal possibility of contesting the decisions in e.g. administrative courts is removed.

The other two Nobel Prize-awarding bodies in Sweden, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Swedish Academy, are legally private organisations (although enjoying royal patronage), and have therefore not had to make any special arrangements to be able to follow the Nobel Foundation's regulations.

==Non-profit organizations==
{{Main|Koch family foundations}}
The Koch family foundations are a related group of non-profit organizations that began with the establishment of the Fred and Mary Koch Foundation in 1953, and now includes the Charles Koch Foundation, the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation and the Koch Cultural Trust. The organizations collectively have a stated goal of "advancing liberty and freedom" through the support of various causes which "further social progress and sustainable prosperity."&lt;ref name=Foundations&gt;{{cite web|last=Koch Family Foundations|title=Koch Family Foundations and Philanthropy|url=http://www.kochfamilyfoundations.org/about.asp|accessdate=1 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623115758/http://www.kochfamilyfoundations.org/about.asp|archive-date=23 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the direct action of the non-profits, the groups have also contributed financially to other philanthropic organizations in the fields of research, public well-being, arts, and education, including contributions to scholarship programs, university support, and loan assistance through organizations like the [[United Negro College Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/06/06/koch-brothers-donate-25-million-to-united-negro-college-fund/ |title=Koch brothers donate $25 million to United Negro College Fund |date=2014-06-06 |accessdate=2014-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activities==
{{Main|Political activities of the Koch brothers}}
Charles and David Koch have been active in American politics since at least 1980, when David Koch was the Libertarian Party's vice-presidential nominee. Their [[political contributions]] began to attract widespread attention from media outlets in 2008, when, through their family foundations, the brothers contributed to 34 political and policy organizations, three of which they founded, and several of which they directed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jane|last=Mayer|authorlink=Jane Mayer|title=Covert Operations: The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama|date=2010-08-30|publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]]|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all|work=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have since organized a network of libertarian and conservative donors, candidates, think tanks, and other groups. As an example of their influence, Jane Mayer noted House Speaker [[John Boehner]]'s appeal to David Koch in 2011 when Boehner needed votes to prevent a [[government shutdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/us/politics/father-of-koch-brothers-helped-build-nazi-oil-refinery-book-says.html?_r=0 | title=Father of Koch Brothers Helped Build Nazi Oil Refinery, Book Says | work=New York Times | date=Jan 11, 2016 | author=Confessore, Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Americans for Prosperity", founded by David Koch, has been reported by [[Kenneth Vogel]] of ''[[Politico]]'' to be one of the main nonprofit groups assisting the [[Tea Party movement]]; but in 2010, Koch spokeswoman Melissa Cohlmia distanced the Kochs from the tea parties and [[FreedomWorks]] saying that "no funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, Charles Koch or David Koch specifically to support the tea parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Vogel| first = Kenneth P. | title = Tea party's growing money problem | newspaper = [[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]| date = August 9, 2010| url = http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/40800.html | accessdate = 2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Koch Family Foundations and Philanthropy website, "the foundations and the individual giving of Koch family members" have financially supported organizations "fostering entrepreneurship, education, human services, at-risk youth, arts and culture, and medical research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kochfamilyfoundations.org/Foundations.asp |title=Koch Family Foundations and Philanthropy - Foundations |publisher=Kochfamilyfoundations.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811095153/http://www.kochfamilyfoundations.org/Foundations.asp |archive-date=2014-08-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Republican congressman [[Joe Scarborough]], co-host of MSNBC's ''[[Morning Joe]]'', has pointed out that, although their critics are usually unaware of the fact, the Koch brothers have supported more than just what are generally considered conservative causes. They opposed [[George W. Bush]] on many issues, are [[pro-choice]], support [[same sex marriage]], and worked closely with the [[President Obama|Obama White House]] for the [[Obama administration]]'s [[criminal justice reform]] initiatives that aligned with their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/charles-koch--we-havent-backed-a-candidate-yet-557922883528 "Charles Koch sits down with Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski to discuss opposing George W.

In early 2018, political advocacy groups linked to the Koch family pledged to spend $400 million on the [[2018 midterm elections]], including $20 million to promote the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|H.R.1 – An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018]] to skeptical voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/27/koch-brothers-network-to-spend-400-million-in-midterm-election-cycle.html|title=Koch brothers' network boosts spending for midterm cycle, including $20 million to sell GOP tax law|last=Mui|first=Ylan|date=2018-01-27|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public policy==   
The Koch family funding apparatus has been funding libertarian groups through [[think tanks]] for over forty years. [[The Cato Institute]], which Charles Koch helped create in 1974, is consistently ranked as among the top 25 U.S. think tanks overall in terms of influence on public policy in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rojc |first1=Phillip |title=Rightward, Ho!

The '''Ministry of Defence Industry of [[Azerbaijan]]''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Respublikasının Müdafiə Sənayesi Nazirliyi}}) is a [[governmental agency]] within the [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan]] in charge of design, manufacturing, regulation and maintenance of products in the fields of defense, radio electronics, instrument engineering.

The Ministry was established on December 16, 2005 by presidential decree. The new Ministry, incorporated the [[State Departments for Military Industry]] and for [[Armaments and the Military Science Center]], each of which was formerly a separate agency within the [[Military of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani Defense Ministry]].[[Yavar Jamalov]] was in charge of heading this ministry between March 2006 – 23 June 2018. &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.az/articles/politics/131950 Azerbaijani Defense Industry Minister Yavar Jamalov dies. news.az]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Azerbaijan has a desire to become a major arms exporter to the [[South Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Middle East]]. It was announced in January 2008 that the defence industry of Azerbaijan would begin to manufacture [[armoured personnel carrier]]s and [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s, as well as small calibre artillery guns.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Monitoring Service, APA News Agency,, [http://www.un-az.org/undp/bulnews55/en3.php AZERBAIJAN TO START MANUFACTURING ARMS, MILITARY HARDWARE IN 2008], 26 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this has actually taken place is unclear. The new ministry is cooperating with the defence sectors of Ukraine, Belarus and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Giragosian, [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/02/2b0bdd2d-49a6-4bff-826d-05edefe4dbdb.html Azerbaijan: Baku Signals New Determination For Defense Reform], RFE/RL, February 01, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 several more military factories were created in Azerbaijan.

According to Sumarinly, the MDI has been in talks with various [[Israel]]i defense firms and two [[Turkey|Turkish]] companies about the production of an armored vehicle based on the [[Russia]]n [[T-55]] [[tank]]’s chassis. MDI will also provide 30 South-African-designed Matador and Marauder armored vehicles to the army.

'''Matador and Marauder mine-protected vehicles at the military parade in [[Baku, Azerbaijan]]'''

In March 2011 the MDI presented its prototype of an Austrian-designed four-seater known as the Diamond DA-42 military passenger plane. The plane is assembled by AZAD Systems, an Azerbaijani state-owned firm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/node/63180 Azerbaijan: Baku Aims to Become Regional Arms Dealer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, Azerbaijani military production more than doubled between 2009 and 2010, and the product line expanded by 17 percent, according to MDI.

Bayar told.&lt;ref name="azmitup1"&gt;[http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=242528 Azerbaijan May Join Turkey's New Tank Manufacturing Project, Bureaucrat]&lt;/ref&gt;

Azerbaijani-made prototypes of Orbiter 2M [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] are expected to undergo testing for up to two years. Full-scale production won’t begin before 2013, under the existing timetable.&lt;ref name="Abbasov"/&gt;  Production of drones has started at Azad Systems, a joint venture between Azerbaijan’s Defence Industry Ministry and Israeli manufacturer Aeronautics.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel Markets UAVs To Moslems"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8771">A '''national numbering agency''' ('''NNA''') is the organisation in each country responsible for issuing [[International Securities Identification Number]]s (ISIN) as described by the [[ISO 6166]] standard and the Classification of Financial Instruments code as described by the [[ISO 10962]] standard.  The role of NNA is typically assigned to the national [[stock exchange]], [[central bank]], or [[financial regulator]] but may be as diverse as a financial data provider or clearing and custodian organisation for that country.

There is a global governing body that coordinates the work of the NNAs called the Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anna-web.com |association of NNAs&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1939">'''Nils Christoffer Bøckman''' (6 July 1880 – 22 December 1973) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] lieutenant-colonel and [[businessperson]].

Born in [[Trondheim]], Bøckman was educated at the military academy, graduating as lieutenant in 1901. He was promoted to captain in 1905, major in 1930, and lieutenant-colonel as part of his participation in [[World War II]] in Northern Norway.&lt;ref name=aspenberg&gt;{{cite book |last=Aspenberg |first=Nils Carl |authorlink=Nils Carl Aspenberg |title=På meterspor i Nidaros |year=1995 |publisher=[[Baneforlaget]] |location=Oslo |pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bøckman started working for [[Meråker Brug]], where he was responsible for the estates in [[Verdal]]. He was also president of [[Trondhjems Skiklub]]. In 1916, he was elected into the board of the tramway company [[Graakalbanen]]. In 1919, he was hired as director of the company, and would remain in the position until 1966, when the company was nationalized. During World War II, two members of the company's board were executed. When Bøckman would not call in the Nazi-appointed board that replaced them, he was arrested and spent the rest of the war in the prison camps [[Falstad concentration camp|Falstad]] and [[Grini concentration camp|Grini]].&lt;ref name=aspenberg/&gt; Being arrested on 2 March 1943, he was imprisoned at Grini from 19 March 1944 to [[Victory in Europe Day|8 May 1945]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Norsk fangeleksikon.

'''Paek Son-haeng''' (1848 November – 1933) was a [[Korean people|Korean]] businesswoman known for her [[philanthropy]].  The name "Son Haeng" means virtuous deeds, and was a nickname bestowed on her due to her contributions.  North Korean sources claim that she was born in modern-day Chung-kuyŏk, [[Pyongyang]], but South Korean sources claim that she was born in [[Suwon]].&lt;ref&gt;North:  {{cite web|url=http://www.uriminzokkiri.com/KrOne_magj/news/2006/07-01/2-4.htm|title=인덕높은 애국자로 내세워주시여|work=Uriminzokkiri.com|accessdate=2006-08-03}}
South: {{cite web|url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=72683|title=백선행|work=Naver encyclopedia|accessdate=2006-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;   She was widowed at the age of 16 or 20, and spent the rest of her life saving money while spending very little.  Regardless of her place of birth, she spent most of her life in Pyongyang, where most of her donations were made.

Paek has often been used by the North Korean regime as an example of a good capitalist, and contrasted to the majority of capitalists who were miserly and non-patriotic.  She is mentioned in [[Kim Il Sung]]'s ''[[With the Century]]'' as someone respected by the people as "a great war hero" due to her success in making money under the Japanese regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uriminzokkiri.com/Newspaper/english/Books/Segi/Segi1/htm/36.htm|title=5. The Song of the River Amnok|accessdate=2006-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2006, her memorial stone was rediscovered and restored in Pyongyang.

Paek made her first major donation after turning 61 in 1908 (see [[East Asian age reckoning]]), when she supported the construction of the Paeksŏn Bridge across the [[Taedong River]].  In 1922, she built a three-story public assembly hall in Pyongyang.  She donated land to the [[Kwangson School]], a public school in Pyongyang, in 1923, and to the [[Changdok School]] in 1924.  Thereafter she also provided land and an endowment to the school run by [[Samuel Austin Moffet]], and also provided large amounts land to the [[Sunghyon School]] in Pyongyang.   In 1925, she donated her entire fortune to charity groups.

The [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial government]] offered her an award for her contributions, but she refused.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

'''Rein Otsason''' (24 May 1931 in [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]] – 30 October 2004 in [[Tallinn]], Estonia) was an Estonian banker.

==Biography==
Otsason grew up in southern Estonia. After obtaining secondary education he came to study in [[Tallinn]] and graduated in 1954 from [[Tallinn University of Technology|Tallinn Polytechnical Institute]] as an [[economist]]. He became one of the leading researchers on economics, being finally nominated as the Director of the Institute of Economics at the Estonian Academy of Sciences. Otsason completed a [[doctorate]] in economics in 1984.

From 1988 to 1989 he worked as the Head of the State Plan Committee of the Estonian SSR. Those were the years of political and economical liberation, the beginning of breaking away from the Soviet system. On 15 December 1989 the Estonian government decided to establish the [[Bank of Estonia]] (''Eesti Pank''). On 28 December 1989 the Bank Law of the Republic of Estonia was passed and Otsason was appointed the first President of the Bank of Estonia. On 1 January 1990 the Bank of Estonia began its work as independent bank of issue.

===Bank of Estonia===

Otsason led the Bank of Estonia in its very first years when legal acts regulating the activities of the bank were created and monetary reform to re-establish [[Estonian kroon]] as the national currency of Estonia was prepared. On 15 March 1990 the Statutes of the Bank of Estonia were approved; on 15 May 1990 the procedure for establishment of commercial banks was established. The programmes for transition to national currency were finished in November 1990 and next year started the preparations for [[monetary reform]].

Otsason participated in the work of Monetary Reform Committee established on 27 March 1991 and led by Prime Minister [[Edgar Savisaar]]. He signed on 10 May 1991 a contract with the company [[Thomas de la Rue &amp; Co.|Thomas De La Rue &amp; Co Ltd.]] for printing banknotes of Estonian kroons. Although his work was crucial for the success of monetary reform, he was not the one to supervise the reform. His wish to postpone the monetary reform until a way will be found to alleviate social problems caused by the reform led to confrontation with his superiors and on 23 September 1991 he was replaced with [[Siim Kallas]]. The reform took place on 20 June 1992. 

Otsason and Siim Kallas are often called the "fathers of Estonian kroon". Otsason was decorated by the President of the Republic with the Estonian Order of the Coat of Arms, 4th class (2003).

===Estonian Credit Bank===

Otsason started to work on creating his own bank. The commercial bank known as Estonian Credit Bank (''Eesti Krediidipank'') was established on 15 March 1992. Otsason was the leader of the bank from its establishment till his death, first as the Chairman of the Board and since 2000 as the Chairman of the Council. He and his wife Valentina Otsason were also the main shareholders of the Estonian Credit Bank. Using his extensive knowledge and connections he managed to maintain the bank even during the economical and financial crisis of 1997-1999 when numerous small financial institutions went bankrupt. 

As the President of the Estonian Credit Bank he was also a board member of the Estonian Banking Association (''Eesti Pangaliit'').

In 2003 Otsason started co-operation with the [[Bank of Moscow]], which obtained 18,69% of the shares of the Estonian Credit Bank through its subsidiary company Latvian Business Bank. After Otsason's death, the Latvian Business Bank became a major shareholder of the Estonian Credit Bank, obtaining 60% of shares on 2 August 2005.

===Politics===

Otsason was a member of the [[Union for the Republic - Res Publica]] and was a candidate at the [[Estonian parliamentary election, 2003]]. He was elected to the Estonian Parliament ([[Riigikogu]]), but turned down his seat and decided to continue his work in the bank.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2993">'''Robert Christiaan Noortman''' (5 March 1946 – 14 January 2007) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] art dealer.

Noortman, born in [[Heemstede]] opened his first gallery in [[Hulsberg]]. In 1974 he expanded to [[London]] and later also to [[New York City]]. In 1980 he moved his Hulsberg gallery to [[Maastricht]] to merge it with the already existing gallery there, while he closed his foreign galleries. In June 2006 he sold his last gallery for 44 million [[euro]]s and still remained in function as a director.&lt;ref&gt;Schutten/Van Duyne (2015), pp. 157-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Noortman was instrumental in the founding of the Maastricht-based [[The European Fine Art Fair]] and for ten years was TEFAF's director.

For fun Noortman studied for and graduated as a commercial pilot and later flew through twelve European countries in one single day by daylight. This record was named in the [[Guinness Book of Records]].

Noortman suffered from [[osteoarthritis]] and [[cancer]], but died because of a [[myocardial infarction]] on 14 January 2007 in [[Kuttekoven]], two days after he received an award from the city of Maastricht for his positive influence on Maastricht and its area. Earlier in his life he already won the title of "Honorary [[Liveryman]] of the City of London" and the " Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres" in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Schutten/Van Duyne (2015), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his death Noortman was accused of art theft, willful destruction of artworks and insurance fraude.&lt;ref&gt;Schutten/Van Duyne (2015), pp. 153-155.&lt;/ref&gt; The investigations by the police, private detectives, the [[Art Loss Register]], Sotheby's and the insurance companies involved, has not led to a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;A quotation from Schutten/Van Duyne (2015), pp. 162-163: ''There is still no legal proof that Noortman orchestrated the theft, and there probably never will be. Nevertheless, Julian Radcliffe [director of the [[Art Loss Register]]] thinks "there's very strong evidence that Noortman was behind the theft and it's highly likely that the insurance companies expect that their claims will be rewarded."''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery, owned by Sotheby's, continued with Noortman's son William as its director, but suffered from negative publicity. After moving first to [[Amsterdam]] and then to London, it closed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Schutten/Van Duyne (2015), pp. 161-162.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Standard International Trade Classification''' ('''SITC''') is a classification of goods used to classify the exports and imports of a country to enable comparing different countries and years. The classification system is maintained by the [[United Nations]]. The SITC classification, is currently at revision four, which was promulgated in 2006.

The SITC is recommended only for analytical purposes - trade statistics are recommended to be collected and compiled in the [[Harmonized System]] instead.

The following excerpt was taken from the United Nations Statistics Division, international trade statistics branch:

"For compiling international trade statistics on all merchandise entering international trade, and to promote international comparability of international trade statistics. The commodity groupings of SITC reflect (a) the materials used in production, (b) the processing stage, (c) market practices and uses of the products, (d) the importance of the commodities in terms of world trade, and (e) technological changes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=14 "The United Nations Statistics Division"] Standard International Trade Classification&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10046">'''Tenant screening''' is a process used primarily by residential [[landlord]]s and property managers to evaluate prospective tenants.  The purpose is to assess the likelihood the tenant will fulfill the terms of the [[Lease|lease or rental agreement]] and will also take great care of the rental property in question.  The process culminates in a decision as to whether to approve the applicant, approve the applicant conditionally (such as requiring an increased deposit or [[Co-signing|cosigner]]) or deny tenancy.

==Tenant screening process==
The tenant screening process typically begins when the prospective tenant (each adult applicant) completes a rental application, pays an application fee and perhaps a holding deposit.

Rental applications are designed to collect [[personally identifying information]] (name, social security number and date of birth, etc.), address, employment, criminal and eviction history.  A signature is generally required, attesting to the accuracy of information provided, agreeing to certain terms and conditions and authorizing procurement of a tenant screening report.

Valid government issued photo identification is typically required to confirm the identity of applicants and in compliance with the [[Federal Trade Commission]]'s (FTC's) identity theft [[Red Flags Rule]].

Most landlords rely on a tenant screening company to produce a tenant screening report - to compile relevant credit, [[public records]] and other information needed to adequately vet prospective tenants.  Information gleaned from the application, tenant screening report and the landlord's own research is used to arrive at a decision based on landlord's rental criteria.

Applicant initiated tenant screening services are beginning to emerge. Under this model, applicants order reports on themselves and grant access to prospective landlords.

==Tenant screening companies==
Tenant screening services are specialized consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) or investigative consumer reporting agencies as defined and regulated by the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] (FCRA), [http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/031224fcra.pdf 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq].

CRAs have many obligations under the FCRA.  Notably,they must establish the identity of each end-user (landlord) and the purpose for which the information is sought - before providing a tenant screening report.  
::*They must "follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates".
::*"Upon request, and subject to section 610(a)(1)of the FCRA (§ 1681h), clearly and accurately disclose to the consumer "all information in the consumer's file at the time of the request."  Failure to do so can result in strong regulatory action.  See http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2010/02/saferent.shtm.
::*Additional CRA compliance procedures are outlined in Section 607 of the FCRA (15 U.S.C. § 1681e).

==Tenant screening reports==
Tenant screening reports contain one or more of the following elements:
::*Consumer [[Credit history|credit report]] (with or without a score) - from one of the three national credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax or Transunion).
::*[[Eviction]] records search
::*[[Criminal record]]s search
::*[[Sex offender registry]] search
::*Specially designated nationals search (frequently referred to as an OFAC search)
::*Rental references
::*Employment verifications
::*Recommendation - based on the landlord's criteria (parameters)

[[Credit history|Credit reports]] and database searches are often returned instantly via [[Transport Layer Security|secure web sites]].  Additional information resulting from more in-depth public records searches, rental references and employment verifications can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days.

==Landlord responsibilities==

Landlords are Users of Consumer Reports, also as defined and regulated by the FCRA.  The FCRA imposes specific requirements on landlords as Users.  Notably, they must "…provide oral, written, or electronic notice of adverse action taken based in whole or in part on any information contained in a consumer (tenant screening] report.  Adverse action is a determination that is adverse to the interest of the consumer.  Certainly denial of tenancy is an adverse action.  But so too is attaching additional terms, such as requiring an additional deposit or co-signer.  The notification must include:
::*The name, address and telephone number of the consumer reporting agency (tenant screening company] that furnished the report; and
::*The consumer's right to a free copy of the tenant screening report; and
::*The consumer's right to dispute the accuracy and completeness of the report.

The [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] (Dodd-Frank) amended Section 615 of the FCRA to add a new requirement that a person (landlord) taking Adverse Action…  “provide to the consumer written or electronic disclosure (A) of a numerical [[credit score]] as defined in section 609(f)(2)(A) [of the FCRA] used by such person in taking any Adverse Action based in whole or in part on any information in a consumer report; and (B) of the information set forth in subparagraphs (B) through (E) of section 609(f)(1),” including:
::*Numerical Score
::*Score Range
::*Score Factors
::*Score Date
::*Score Source

==Tenant screening and the law==

There is a substantial body of law regulating consumer reporting.  The FCRA, 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. as amended by the [[Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act]] of 2003 (FACTA) and more recently by Dodd-Frank is the primary body of law regulating consumer reporting.  Many states have laws regulating consumer reporting as well.  Section 625 of the FCRA (15 U.S.C. § 1681t) addresses the Relation (of the FCRA) to State laws by stating that "…this title does not annul, alter, affect, or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this title from complying with the laws of any State with respect to collection, distribution, or use of any information on consumer, …except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of this title…".  Federal law is said to pre-empt state law to the extent of any inconsistencies.

Dodd-Frank transferred regulatory authority over consumer reporting (and therefore tenant screening companies) from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to the new [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] in 2011.

Federal&lt;ref name="Federal Fair Housing Laws"&gt;[http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/FHLaws], Fair Housing Laws and Presidential Orders.&lt;/ref&gt; and state&lt;ref name="Washington Fair Housing Law"&gt;[http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.60.222], Example: state fair housing law.&lt;/ref&gt; fair housing and residential landlord-tenant law impact the tenant screening process in several ways.  It is, in a nutshell, a violation of fair housing law to treat protected individuals differently in the tenant screening process. Fair housing law at the federal level is found in Title VIII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]]. Residential landlord-tenant law often limits what landlords may charge for tenant screening to the actual costs in obtaining the background information, not to exceed the customary costs charged by a screening service in the general area.

==Legal and legislative trends==

Fair housing advocates have long argued for application of the [[Disparate Impact|disparate impact]] legal theory (historically applied to employment practices) to Title VIII ([[Fair Housing Act]]) claims.&lt;ref name="NHLP Disparate Impact Lawsuit Guide"&gt;[http://nhlp.org/files/PRRAC%20Disparate%20Impact%201-2011.pdf], National Housing Law Project (NHLP) Lawsuit Guide.&lt;/ref&gt;  They argue, for example, that people of certain races and ethnicities are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system, that use of criminal records data for tenant screening purposes has a disparate impact on those individuals and is therefore discriminatory.

The debate was largely settled in 2015 when in the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs(The Department) v. The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.(ICP), the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed that a facially neutral business practice that has a disparate impact on a protected class can form the basis of a Fair Housing Act claim. The decision was in part based upon the Housing &amp; Urban Development (HUD) regulation interpreting the Fair Housing Act's Discriminatory Effects Standard - including its burden-shifting framework for adjudicating such claims.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court, Fair Housing and Disparate Impact Discrimination"&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1371_8m58.pdf], Supreme Court and Fair Housing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landlords have a right and obligation &lt;ref name="Charlotte Housing Authority Settlement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://charlotte.news14.com/content/headlines/621791/jury-finds-housing-authority-negligent-in-woman-s-death |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514061952/http://charlotte.news14.com/content/headlines/621791/jury-finds-housing-authority-negligent-in-woman-s-death |archivedate=2012-05-14 |df= }}, Charlotte Housing Authority Settlement.&lt;/ref&gt; to take reasonable steps to protect themselves, their residents and neighbors from prospective residents with a history of violent felonies (for example). Landlords can take steps to reduce their exposure to disparate impact claims by limiting consideration to criminal convictions (versus arrests), to offenses that are relevant to the tenancy, and that occur within a reasonable period of time.

Note section 605 of the FCRA prohibits CRA's from reporting records of arrest which from the date of final disposition antedate the report by more than seven years.  Some states similarly limit reporting of criminal convictions - while there is no such limit in the FCRA.

==Overview==
In simplified terms, the theory of the firm aims to answer these questions:
# Existence. Why do firms emerge? Why are not all transactions in the economy mediated over the market?
# Boundaries. Why is the boundary between firms and the market located exactly there with relation to size and output variety? Which transactions are performed internally and which are negotiated on the market?
# Organization.  Why are firms structured in such a specific way, for example as to hierarchy or decentralization? What is the interplay of formal and informal relationships?
# Heterogeneity of firm actions/performances. What drives different actions and performances of firms?
# Evidence. What tests are there for respective theories of the firm?&lt;ref&gt;Thomas N. Hubbard (2008).

Firms exist as an alternative system to the market-price mechanism when it is more efficient to produce in a non-market environment. For example, in a [[labour economics|labor]] [[Market (economics)|market]], it might be very difficult or costly for [[Business|firms]] or organizations to engage in [[Outline of industrial organization|production]] when they have to hire and fire their workers depending on demand/supply conditions. It might also be costly for [[employees]] to shift companies every day looking for better alternatives. Similarly, it may be costly for companies to find new suppliers daily. Thus, firms engage in a long-term contract with their employees or a long-term contract with suppliers to minimize the [[cost]] or maximize the value of [[property rights (economics)|property rights]].&lt;ref name="Coase"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coase |first=Ronald H. |authorlink= |year=1937 |title=[[The Nature of the Firm]]|journal=Economica |volume=4 |issue=16 |pages=[http://www.sonoma.edu/users/e/eyler/426/coase1.pdf 386–405]|url=|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bengt R.

==Background==
The First World War period saw  change of emphasis in economic theory away from industry-level analysis which mainly included analyzing [[Market (economics)|market]]s to analysis at the level of the firm, as it became increasingly clear that [[perfect competition]] was no longer an adequate model of how firms behaved. Economic theory until then had focused on trying to understand markets alone and there had been little study on understanding why firms or organisations exist. [[Market (economics)|Market]]s are guided by prices and quality as illustrated by vegetable markets where a buyer is free to switch sellers in an exchange.

The need for a revised theory of the firm was emphasized by [[empirical]] studies by [[Adolf Berle]] and [[Gardiner Means]], who made it clear that ownership of a typical [[United States|American]] corporation is spread over a wide number of [[shareholder]]s, leaving control in the hands of managers who own very little [[equity (finance)|equity]] themselves.&lt;ref name="Berle and Means"&gt;

==Transaction cost theory==

{{main|Transaction cost}}

[[Image:Market-Hierarchy-Model.png|500px|right|thumb|The model shows institutions and market as a possible form of organization to coordinate economic transactions. When the external transaction costs are higher than the internal transaction costs, the company will grow. If the external transaction costs are lower than the internal transaction costs the company will be downsized by outsourcing, for example.]]

According to [[Ronald Coase]], people begin to organise their production in firms when the [[transaction cost]] of coordinating production through the market  exchange, given imperfect information, is greater than within the firm.&lt;ref name="Coase"/&gt;

[[Ronald Coase]] set out his [[transaction cost]] theory of the firm in 1937, making it one of the first ([[neoclassical economics|neo-classical]]) attempts to define the firm theoretically in relation to the market.&lt;ref name="Coase"/&gt; One aspect of its 'neoclassicism' lies in presenting an explanation of the firm consistent with [[constant returns to scale]], rather than relying on [[increasing returns to scale]].&lt;ref name="Archibald"&gt;Archibald, G.C. (1987 [2008]). "firm, theory of the," ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 2, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another is in defining a firm in a manner which is both realistic and compatible with the idea of substitution at the margin, so instruments of conventional economic analysis apply. He notes that a firm’s interactions with the market may not be under its control (for instance because of sales taxes), but its internal allocation of resources are: “Within a firm, … market transactions are eliminated and in place of the complicated market structure with exchange transactions is substituted the [[entrepreneur]] … who directs production.”  He asks why alternative methods of production (such as the [[Bid-offer spread|price mechanism]] and [[economic interventionism|economic planning]]), could not either achieve all production, so that either firms use internal prices for all their production, or one big firm runs the entire economy. &lt;!-- see john erdman, 2006 --&gt;

Coase begins from the standpoint that markets could in theory carry out all production, and that what needs to be explained is the existence of the firm, with its "distinguishing mark … [of] the supersession of the price mechanism."  Coase identifies some reasons why firms might arise, and dismisses each as unimportant:

# if some people prefer to work under direction and are prepared to pay for the privilege (but this is unlikely);
# if some people prefer to direct others and are prepared to pay for this (but generally people are paid more to direct others);
# if purchasers prefer goods produced by firms.

Instead, for Coase the main reason to establish a firm is to avoid some of the transaction costs of using the price mechanism. These include discovering relevant prices (which can be reduced but not eliminated by purchasing this information through specialists), as well as the costs of negotiating and writing enforceable contracts for each transaction (which can be large if there is uncertainty). Moreover, contracts in an uncertain world will necessarily be incomplete and have to be frequently re-negotiated. The costs of haggling about division of surplus, particularly if there is [[asymmetric information]] and [[asset specificity]], may be considerable.  &lt;!-- does "surplus" here refer to excess production or to profit? --&gt;

If a firm operated internally under the market system, many contracts would be required (for instance, even for procuring a pen or delivering a presentation).  In contrast, a real firm has very few (though much more complex) contracts, such as defining a manager's power of direction over employees, in exchange for which the employee is paid.  These kinds of contracts are drawn up in situations of uncertainty, in particular for relationships which last long periods of time.  Such a situation runs counter to neo-classical economic theory.  The neo-classical market is instantaneous, forbidding the development of extended agent-principal (employee-manager) relationships, of planning, and of [[trust (social sciences)|trust]].  Coase concludes that “a firm is likely therefore to emerge in those cases where a very short-term contract would be unsatisfactory”, and that “it seems improbable that a firm would emerge without the existence of uncertainty”.

He notes that government measures relating to the market ([[sales tax]]es, [[rationing]], [[price controls]]) tend to increase the size of firms, since firms internally would not be subject to such transaction costs.  Thus, Coase defines the firm as "the system of relationships which comes into existence when the direction of resources is dependent on the entrepreneur."  We can therefore think of a firm as getting larger or smaller based on whether the entrepreneur organises more or fewer transactions.

The question then arises of what determines the size of the firm; why does the entrepreneur organise the transactions he does, why no more or less?  Since the reason for the firm's being is to have lower costs than the market, the upper limit on the firm's size is set by costs rising to the point where internalising an additional transaction equals the cost of making that transaction in the market. (At the lower limit, the firm’s costs exceed the market’s costs, and it does not come into existence.)  In practice, diminishing returns to management contribute most to raising the costs of organising a large firm, particularly in large firms with many different plants and differing internal transactions (such as a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]), or if the relevant prices change frequently.

Coase concludes by saying that the size of the firm is dependent on the costs of using the price mechanism, and on the costs of organisation of other entrepreneurs.  These two factors together determine how many products a firm produces and how much of each.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Coase (1988). "The Nature of the Firm: Influence",  ''Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization'', 4(1), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/765013 p. 33]-47. Reprinted in ''The Nature of the Firm: Origins, Evolution, and Development'' (1993), Oliver E. Williamson and S, G.

According to Louis Putterman, most economists accept distinction between intra-firm and interfirm transaction but also that the two shade into each other; the extent of a firm is not simply defined by its capital stock.&lt;ref name="Putterman"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Economic Nature of the Firm |last=Putterman |first= Louis |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-47092-7 |page= |pages= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Barclay Richardson]] for example, notes that a rigid distinction fails because of the existence of intermediate forms between firm and market such as inter-firm co-operation.&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;

Klein (1983) asserts that “Economists now recognise that such a sharp distinction does not exist and that it is useful to consider also transactions occurring within the firm as representing market (contractual) relationships.” The costs involved in such transactions that are within a firm or even between the firms are the [[transaction cost]]s.

Ultimately, whether the firm constitutes a domain of bureaucratic direction that is shielded from market forces or simply “a legal fiction”, “a nexus for a set of contracting relationships among individuals” (as [[Michael C. Jensen|Jensen]] and [[William H. Meckling|Meckling]] put it) is “a function of the completeness of markets and the ability of market forces to penetrate intra-firm relationships”.&lt;ref name="Jensen and Meckling"&gt;

==Managerial and behavioural theories==
It was only in the 1960s that the neo-classical theory of the firm was seriously challenged by alternatives such as managerial and behavioral theories. Managerial theories of the firm, as developed by [[William Baumol]] (1959 and 1962), [[Robin Marris]] (1964) and [[Oliver E. Williamson]] (1966), suggest that managers would seek to maximise their own [[utility]] and consider the implications of this for firm behavior in contrast to the profit-maximising case. (Baumol suggested that managers’ interests are best served by maximising sales after achieving a minimum level of profit which satisfies shareholders.) More recently this has developed into ‘[[principal–agent problem|principal–agent]]’ analysis (e.g., Spence and Zeckhauser&lt;ref name="Spence and Zeckhauser"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spence |first=Michael A. |authorlink= |author2=Zeckhauser, Richard  |year=1971 |title=Insurance, Information, and Individual Action |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=380–387 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ross (1973){{citation needed|date=April 2009}} on problems of contracting with asymmetric information) which models a widely applicable case where a principal (a shareholder or firm for example) cannot costlessly infer how an agent (a manager or supplier, say) is behaving. This may arise either because the agent has greater expertise or knowledge than the principal, or because the principal cannot directly observe the agent’s actions; it is asymmetric information which leads to a problem of [[moral hazard]]. This means that to an extent managers can pursue their own interests. Traditional managerial models typically assume that managers, instead of maximising profit, maximise a simple objective utility function (this may include salary, [[Employee benefit|perks]], security, power, prestige) subject to an arbitrarily given profit constraint (profit [[satisficing]]).

===Behavioural approach===
{{Main|Behavioural theory of the firm}}
The behavioural approach, as developed in particular by [[Richard Cyert]] and [[James G. March]] of the [[Carnegie School]] places emphasis on explaining how decisions are taken within the firm, and goes well beyond neoclassical economics.&lt;ref name="Cyert and March"&gt;
{{cite book

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of this depended on [[Herbert A. Simon]]’s work in the 1950s concerning behaviour in situations of uncertainty, which argued that “people possess limited cognitive ability and so can exercise only ‘[[bounded rationality]]’ when making decisions in complex, uncertain situations”. Thus individuals and groups tend to "[[satisfice]]"—that is, to attempt to attain realistic goals, rather than maximize a utility or profit function. Cyert and March argued that the firm cannot be regarded as a monolith, because different individuals and groups within it have their own aspirations and conflicting interests, and that firm behaviour is the weighted outcome of these conflicts. Organisational mechanisms (such as "satisficing" and sequential decision-taking) exist to maintain conflict at levels that are not unacceptably detrimental. Compared to ideal state of productive efficiency, there is organisational slack (Leibenstein’s [[X-inefficiency]]).

===Team production===
[[Armen Alchian]] and Harold Demsetz's analysis of [[team production]] extends and clarifies earlier work by Coase.&lt;ref name="Alchian and Demsetz"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last=Alchian | first=Armen A.
 | author-link=Armen Alchian

 | volume=62 |issue=5
 | pages=777–795
 | doi=
 | jstor=1815199
 | publisher=American Economic Association
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus according to them the firm emerges because extra output is provided by team production, but that the success of this depends on being able to manage the team so that metering problems (it is costly to measure the marginal outputs of the co-operating inputs for reward purposes) and attendant shirking (the moral hazard problem) can be overcome, by estimating [[marginal productivity]] by observing or specifying input behaviour. Such monitoring as is therefore necessary, however, can only be encouraged effectively if the monitor is the recipient of the activity’s residual income (otherwise the monitor herself would have to be monitored, ad infinitum). For Alchian and Demsetz, the firm therefore is an entity which brings together a team which is more productive working together than at arm’s length through the market, because of informational problems associated with monitoring of effort. In effect, therefore, this is a "principal-agent" theory, since it is asymmetric information within the firm which Alchian and Demsetz emphasise must be overcome. In Barzel (1982)’s theory of the firm, drawing on Jensen and Meckling (1976), the firm emerges as a means of centralising monitoring and thereby avoiding costly redundancy in that function (since in a firm the responsibility for monitoring can be centralised in a way that it cannot if production is organised as a group of workers each acting as a firm).{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The weakness in Alchian and Demsetz’s argument, according to Williamson, is that their concept of team production has quite a narrow range of application, as it assumes outputs cannot be related to individual inputs. In practice this may have limited applicability (small work group activities, the largest perhaps a symphony orchestra), since most outputs within a firm (such as manufacturing and secretarial work) are separable, so that individual inputs can be rewarded on the basis of outputs. Hence team production cannot offer the explanation of why firms (in particular, large multi-plant and multi-product firms) exist, etc.

==Asset specificity==
For [[Oliver E. Williamson]], the existence of firms derives from ‘asset specificity’ in production, where assets are specific to each other such that their value is much less in a second-best use.&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last=Williamson |first=Oliver E.

 | url=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This causes problems if the assets are owned by different firms (such as purchaser and supplier), because it will lead to protracted [[bargaining]] concerning the [[gains from trade]], because both agents are likely to become locked into a position where they are no longer [[competing]] with a (possibly large) number of agents in the entire market, and the incentives are no longer there to represent their positions honestly: large-numbers bargaining is transformed into small-number bargaining.

If the transaction is a recurring or lengthy one, re-negotiation may be necessary as a continual power struggle takes place concerning the gains from trade, further increasing the [[transaction cost]]s. Moreover, there are likely to be situations where a purchaser may require a particular, firm-specific investment of a supplier which would be profitable for both; but after the investment has been made it becomes a sunk cost and the purchaser can attempt to re-negotiate the contract such that the supplier may make a loss on the investment (this is the [[hold-up problem]], which occurs when either party asymmetrically incurs substantial costs or benefits before being paid for or paying for them). In this kind of a situation, the most efficient way to overcome the continual conflict of interest between the two agents (or coalitions of agents) may be the removal of one of them from the equation by [[takeover]] or [[merger]]. Asset specificity can also apply to some extent to both physical and human capital, so that the hold-up problem can also occur with labour (e.g. labour can threaten a strike, because of the lack of good alternative [[human capital]]; but equally the firm can threaten to fire).

Probably the best constraint on such opportunism is [[reputation]] (rather than the [[law]], because of the difficulty of [[negotiating]], writing and enforcement of [[contract]]s).  If a reputation for opportunism significantly damages an agent’s dealings in the future, this alters the [[incentive]]s to be opportunistic.&lt;ref name="Oliar and Sprigman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oliar |first=Dotan |authorlink= |author2=Sprigman, Christopher Jon  |year=2008 |title=There's No Free Laugh (Anymore): The Emergence of Intellectual Property Norms and the Transformation of Stand-Up Comedy |journal=Virginal Law Review |volume=94 |issue=8 |pages=1787–1867 |url=http://www.virginialawreview.org/content/pdfs/94/1787.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson sees the limit on the size of the firm as being given partly by costs of [[delegation]] (as a firm’s size increase its hierarchical [[bureaucracy]] does too), and the large firm’s increasing inability to replicate the high-powered incentives of the residual income of an owner-entrepreneur. This is partly because it is in the nature of a large firm that its existence is more secure and less dependent on the actions of any one individual (increasing the incentives to shirk), and because intervention rights from the centre characteristic of a firm tend to be accompanied by some form of income insurance to compensate for the lesser responsibility, thereby diluting incentives. Milgrom and Roberts (1990) explain the increased cost of management as due to the incentives of employees to provide false information beneficial to themselves, resulting in costs to managers of filtering information, and often the making of decisions without full information.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} This grows worse with firm size and more layers in the hierarchy. Empirical analyses of transaction costs have attempted to measure and operationalize transaction costs.&lt;ref&gt;Barak D. Richman and Jeffrey Mache (2008).

10(1), pp. 1-63. [http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bap.2008.10.1/bap.2008.10.1.1210/bap.2008.10.1.1210.xml Abstract.] [http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2287&amp;context=faculty_scholarship PDF.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Special Issue of Journal of Retailing in Honor of The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2009 to Oliver E. Williamson, 86(3), pp.  209-290, article-preview [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00224359/86/3 links] (2010). Edited by [[Arne Nygaard]] and [[Robert Dahlstrom]].&lt;/ref&gt; Research that attempts to measure transaction costs is the most critical limit to efforts to potential falsification and validation of transaction cost economics.

==Firm economies==
The theory of the firm considers what bounds the size and output variety of firms. This includes how firms may be able to combine labour and capital so as to lower the [[average cost]] of output, either from increasing, decreasing, or constant [[returns to scale]] for one product line or from  [[economies of scope]] for more than one product line.&lt;ref name="Archibald"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John C. Panzar and Robert D. Willig (1981). "Economies of Scope," ''American Economic Review'', 71(2), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1815729 p. 268]–272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Tirole]] (1988). ''The Theory of Industrial Organization''. "The Theory of the Firm," pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HIjsF0XONF8C&amp;pg=PA18 18–20.] MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other models==
[[Efficiency wages|Efficiency wage]] models like that of Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) suggest wage rents as an addition to monitoring, since this gives employees an incentive not to shirk, given a certain probability of detection and the consequence of being fired.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} Williamson, Wachter and Harris (1975) suggest promotion incentives within the firm as an alternative to morale-damaging monitoring, where promotion is based on objectively measurable performance.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} (The difference between these two approaches may be that the former is applicable to a [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] environment, the latter to a [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] one). Leibenstein (1966) sees a firm’s norms or conventions, dependent on its history of management initiatives, labour relations and other factors, as determining the firm’s "culture" of effort, thus affecting the firm’s productivity and hence size.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

[[George Akerlof]] (1982) develops a gift exchange model of [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], in which employers offer wages unrelated to variations in output and above the market level, and workers have developed a concern for each other’s welfare, such that all put in effort above the minimum required, but the more able workers are not rewarded for their extra productivity; again, size here depends not on rationality or efficiency but on social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hans|first1=V. Basil|title=Roles and Responsibilities of Managerial Economists: Empowering Business through Methodology and Strategy|journal=10|date=December 2016|volume=2|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, the limit to the firm’s size is given where costs rise to the point where the market can undertake some transactions more efficiently than the firm.

Recently, [[Yochai Benkler]] further questioned the rigid distinction between firms and markets based on the increasing salience of “[[commons-based peer production]]” systems such as [[open source software]] (e.g., [[Linux]]), [[Wikipedia]], [[Creative Commons]], etc.  He put forth this argument in ''[[The Wealth of Networks|The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom]]'', which was released in 2006 under a Creative Commons [[share-alike]] license.&lt;ref name="Benkler"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets |last=Benkler |first=Yochai |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.benkler.org/wealth_of_networks/index.php/Main_Page |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grossman-Hart-Moore theory ==
In modern [[contract theory]], the “theory of the firm” is often identified with the “property rights approach” that was developed by [[Sanford J. Grossman]], [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver D. Hart]], and [[John Hardman Moore|John H. Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contract theory|last = Bolton|first = Patrick|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Dewatripont|first2 = Matthias}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Thinking about the Firm: A Review of Daniel Spulber's The Theory of the Firm|url = http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/abs/10.1257/jel.49.1.101|journal = Journal of Economic Literature|date = 2011|issn = 0022-0515|pages = 101-113|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1257/jel.49.1.101|first = Oliver|last = Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property rights approach to the theory of the firm is also known as the “Grossman-Hart-Moore theory”. In their seminal work, Grossman and Hart (1986), Hart and Moore (1990) and Hart (1995) developed the [[Incomplete contracts|incomplete contracting]] paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Costs and Benefits of Ownership: A Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261404|journal = Journal of Political Economy|date = 1986|issn = 0022-3808|pages = 691-719|volume = 94|issue = 4|doi = 10.1086/261404|first = Sanford J.|last = Grossman|first2 = Oliver D.|last2 = Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Property Rights and the Nature of the Firm|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261729|journal = Journal of Political Economy|date = 1990|issn = 0022-3808|pages = 1119-1158|volume = 98|issue = 6|doi = 10.1086/261729|first = Oliver|last = Hart|first2 = John|last2 = Moore|citeseerx = 10.1.1.472.9089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Firms, contracts, and financial structure.|last = Hart|first = Oliver|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that if contracts cannot specify what is to be done given every possible contingency, then property rights (and hence firm boundaries) matter. Specifically, consider a seller of an intermediate good and a buyer. Should the seller own the physical assets that are necessary to produce the good (non-integration) or should the buyer be the owner (integration)? After relationship-specific investments have been made, the seller and the buyer bargain. When they are symmetrically informed, they will always agree to collaborate. Yet, the division of the ex post surplus depends on the parties’ disagreement payoffs (the payoffs they would get if no ex post agreement were reached), which in turn depend on the ownership structure. Thus, the ownership structure has an influence on the incentives to invest. A central insight of the theory is that the party with the more important investment decision should be the owner. Another prominent conclusion is that joint asset ownership is suboptimal if investments are in human capital. 

The Grossman-Hart-Moore model has been successfully applied in many contexts, e.g. with regard to [[privatization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Proper Scope of Government: Theory and an Application to Prisons|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/112/4/1127|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date = 1997|issn = 0033-5533|pages = 1127-1161|volume = 112|issue = 4|doi = 10.1162/003355300555448|language = en|first = Oliver|last = Hart|first2 = Andrei|last2 = Shleifer|first3 = Robert W.|last3 = Vishny}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiu (1998) and DeMeza and Lockwood (1998) have extended the model by considering different bargaining games that the parties may play ex post (which can explain ownership by the less important investor).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Noncooperative Bargaining, Hostages, and Optimal Asset Ownership|last = Chiu|first = Y.

'''Thomas King Carroll''' (April 29, 1793 – October 3, 1873) served as the [[List of Governors of Maryland|21st Governor]] of the state of [[Maryland]] in the United States from 1830 to 1831.  He also served as a judge, and in the [[Maryland House of Delegates]] from 1816 to 1817.

==Biography==
He was born at [[Kingston Hall]], in [[Somerset County, Maryland]] on April 29, 1793, the son of Col. Henry James Carroll and Elizabeth (Barnes) King. He was related to [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], who was one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].  He attended [[Charlotte Hall Military Academy|Charlotte Hall School]], then in 1802, he entered Washington Academy in Somerset County where he remained for the next eight years.  He then become a junior at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and graduated in 1811. Carroll studied law, first in the office of [[Ephraim King Wilson]] in [[Snow Hill, Maryland|Snow Hill]], then under [[Robert Goodloe Harper]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]. On June 23, 1814, he had married Julianna Stevenson and they had nine children, one of whom was [[Anna Ella Carroll]] (1815–1893).&lt;ref name="msa"&gt;{{Citation |author=Frank F. White Jr.|title=The Governors of Maryland 1777–1970|url=http://www.msa.md.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/001400/001452/html/1452bio2.html|accessdate=April 28, 2011|year=1970|publisher= The Hall of Records Commission|location=Annapolis|pages=91–94|chapter=Biography of Thomas King Carroll|isbn= | oclc = 144620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his father’s death, he returned to Kingston Hall where he became the manager of the family’s estate. Shortly after, he became active in the political affairs of that county. During the sessions of 1816 and 1817, Carroll was elected without opposition to the House of Delegates. He was a member of the Levy Court of Somerset County between July 1825 and February 1826, when he was appointed Judge of the Orphans’ Court. He was serving in that office when he was elected Governor in December 1829. He had also served as a [[Maryland State Senate|Senatorial]] elector in 1821 and 1826.&lt;ref name="msa"/&gt;

Carroll was elected governor on January 4, 1830, defeating incumbent [[Daniel Martin (Governor of Maryland)|Daniel Martin]] by a vote of 50 to 43. While governor, he joined in the movement to improve the collegiate department of the [[University of Maryland]], as well as that of advocating a statewide public school system. He also aided veterans of the Revolutionary War in their efforts to receive pensions and other benefits from then federal government.&lt;ref name="msa"/&gt; He lost reelection to Martin, and retired at the end of his one-year term. Carroll is the only Maryland Governor with the same predecessor and successor.

Carroll retired to Kingston Hall at the close of his administration and lived there until 1840, when he moved to [[Dorchester County, Maryland]], residing on a large estate near Church Creek. When [[Zachary Taylor]] became president in 1849, he appointed Carroll Naval Officer of the [[Port of Baltimore]].  (Naval Officers, Collectors and other appointees were responsible for assessing and collecting [[Tariff|customs duties]] at U.S. ports, and for levying fines on those who attempted to avoid duties.  They were compensated based on a percentage of the duties and fines collected, making the positions highly sought after political appointments.)

He died at his home Walnut Landing, in Dorchester County on October 3, 1873, and was buried in Old Trinity Church Cemetery following Masonic burial services.&lt;ref name="msa"/&gt;

'''Unemployment benefits''' (depending on the jurisdiction also called '''unemployment insurance''' or '''unemployment compensation''') are payments made by back authorized bodies to [[unemployment|unemployed]] people. In the United States, benefits are funded by a compulsory governmental insurance system, not taxes on individual citizens. Depending on the jurisdiction and the status of the person, those sums may be small, covering only basic needs, or may compensate the lost time proportionally to the previous earned salary.

Unemployment benefits are generally given only to those registering as unemployed, and often on conditions ensuring that they seek work and do not currently have a job, and are validated as being laid off and not fired for cause in most states.

==History==
[[File:National-insurance-act-1911.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Leaflet promoting the [[National Insurance Act 1911]].]]
The first unemployment benefit scheme was introduced in the [[United Kingdom]] with the [[National Insurance Act 1911]] under the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] government of [[H. H. Asquith]]. The popular measures were to combat the increasing influence of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] among the country's working-class population. The Act gave the British working classes a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment. It only applied to wage earners, however, and their families and the unwaged had to rely on other sources of support, if any.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/national-health-insurance.htm The Cabinet Papers 1915-1982: National Health Insurance Act 1911.] The National Archives, 2013. Retrieved 30 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Key figures in the implementation of the Act included [[Robert Laurie Morant]], and William Braithwaite.

By the time of its implementation, the benefit was criticized by communists, who thought such insurance would prevent workers from starting a revolution, while employers and [[Tory|tories]] saw it as a "necessary evil".&lt;ref name="bogardus"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogardus|first1=Emory S.|authorlink1=Emory S. Bogardus|title=Sociology|date=1950|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|The Macmillan Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|page=424|edition=3rd|chapter=Group Disorganization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme was based on [[actuary|actuarial]] principles and it was funded by a fixed amount each from workers, employers, and taxpayers. It was restricted to particular industries, particularly more volatile ones like shipbuilding, and did not make provision for any dependants. After one week of unemployment, the worker was eligible for receiving 7 shillings/week for up to 15 weeks in a year. By 1913, 2.3 million were insured under the scheme for unemployment benefit.

===Expansion and spread===
The [[Unemployment Insurance Act 1920]] created the dole system of payments for unemployed workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. R. Garside|title=British Unemployment 1919-1939: A Study in Public Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TIp3oq398IC&amp;pg=PA37|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=37|isbn=9780521892544}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dole system provided 39 weeks of unemployment benefits to over 11 million workers—practically the entire civilian working population except domestic service, farm workers, railroad men, and civil servants.

Unemployment benefits were introduced in Germany in 1927, and in most European countries in the period after the [[Second World War]] with the expansion of the [[welfare state]]. Unemployment insurance in the United States originated in [[Wisconsin]] in 1932.&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 213"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmerman |first=Joseph F. |title= ''State and Local Government'' |year= 1970 |publisher= [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] |location=New York, NY |isbn= | pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the [[Social Security Act]] of 1935, the [[federal government of the United States]] effectively encouraged the individual states to adopt unemployment insurance plans.

==Argentina==
In [[Argentina]], successive administrations have used a variety of passive and active labour market interventions to protect workers against the consequences of economic shocks. The government's key institutional response to combat the increase in [[poverty]] and unemployment created by the crisis{{clarify|which crisis? when?|date=November 2017}} was the launch of an active unemployment assistance programme called Plan Jefas y Jefes de Hogar Desocupados (Program for Unemployed Heads of Households).

==Australia==
{{Main article|Social Security (Australia)}}
In [[Australia]], social security benefits, including unemployment benefits, are funded through the taxation system. There is no compulsory national unemployment insurance fund. Rather, benefits are funded in the annual Federal Budget by the National Treasury and are administrated and distributed throughout the nation by the government agency, [[Centrelink]]. Benefit rates are indexed to the Consumer Price Index and are adjusted twice a year according to inflation or deflation.

There are two types of payment available to those experiencing unemployment. The first, called Youth Allowance, is paid to young people aged 16–20 (or 15, if deemed to meet the criteria for being considered 'independent' by Centrelink). Youth Allowance is also paid to full-time students aged 16–24, and to full-time Australian Apprenticeship workers aged 16–24. People aged below 18 who have not completed their High School education, are usually required to be in full-time education, undertaking an apprenticeship or doing training to be eligible for Youth Allowance. For single people under 18 years of age living with a parent or parents the basic rate is [[Australian dollar|A$]]91.60 per week. For over-18- to 20-year-olds living at home this increases to A$110.15 per week. For those aged 18–20 not living at home the rate is A$167.35 per week. There are special rates for those with partners and/or children.

The second kind of payment is called Newstart Allowance and is paid to unemployed people over the age of 21 and under the pension eligibility age. To receive a Newstart payment, recipients must be unemployed, be prepared to enter into an Employment Pathway Plan (previously called an Activity Agreement) by which they agree to undertake certain activities to increase their opportunities for employment, be Australian Residents and satisfy the income test (which limits weekly income to A$32 per week before benefits begin to reduce, until one's income reaches A$397.42 per week at which point no unemployment benefits are paid) and the assets test (an eligible recipient can have assets of up to A$161,500 if he or she owns a home before the allowance begins to reduce and $278,500 if he or she does do not own a home). The rate of Newstart allowance as at 12 January 2010 for single people without children is A$228 per week, paid fortnightly. (This does not include supplemental payments such as Rent Assistance.) Different rates apply to people with partners and/or children.

Effectively, people have had to survive on $39 a day from Newstart since 1994, and there have been calls to raise this by politicians and NGO groups.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.9news.com.au/national/2018/05/09/14/31/john-howard-joins-calls-for-newstart-boost&lt;/ref&gt;

The system in Australia is designed to support recipients no matter how long they have been unemployed. In recent years the former [[Australian Liberal Party|Coalition]] government under [[John Howard]] has increased the requirements of the Activity Agreement, providing for controversial schemes such as [[Work for the Dole]], which requires that people on benefits for 6 months or longer work voluntarily for a community organisation regardless of whether such work increases their skills or job prospects. Since the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government under [[Kevin Rudd]] was elected in 2008, the length of unemployment before one is required to fulfill the requirements of the Activity Agreement (which has been renamed the Employment Pathway Plan) has increased from six to twelve months. There are other options available as alternatives to the Work for the Dole scheme, such as undertaking part-time work or study and training, the basic premise of the Employment Pathway Plan being to keep the welfare recipient active and involved in seeking full-time work.

For people renting their accommodation, unemployment benefits are supplemented by Rent Assistance, which, for single people as at 29 June 2012, begins to be paid when weekly rent is more than A$53.40. Rent Assistance is paid as a proportion of total rent paid (75 cents per dollar paid over $53.40 up to the maximum). The maximum amount of rent assistance payable is A$60.10 per week, and is paid when the total weekly rent exceeds A$133.54 per week. Different rates apply to people with partners and/or children, or who are sharing accommodation.

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], the system now known as Employment Insurance was formerly called [[Unemployment Insurance]]. The name was changed in 1996, in order to alleviate perceived negative connotations. In 2015, Canadian workers pay premiums of 1.62%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/pyrll/clcltng/ei/cnt-chrt-pf-eng.html|title=EI premium rates and maximums|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Canada Revenue Agency|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of insured earnings in return for benefits if they lose their jobs.

The [[Employment and Social Insurance Act]] was passed in 1935 during the [[Great Depression]] by the government of [[R.B. Bennett]] as an attempted Canadian unemployment insurance programme. It was, however, ruled unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] as unemployment was judged to be an insurance matter falling under provincial responsibility. After a constitutional amendment was agreed to by all of the provinces, a reference to "Unemployment Insurance" was added to the matters falling under federal authority under the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], and the first Canadian system was adopted in 1940. Because of these problems Canada was the last major Western country to bring in an employment insurance system. It was extended dramatically by [[Pierre Trudeau]] in 1971 making it much easier to get. The system was sometimes called the 10/42, because one had to work for 10 weeks to get benefits for the other 42 weeks of the year. It was also in 1971 that the UI program was first opened up to maternity and sickness benefits, for 15 weeks in each case.

The generosity of the Canadian UI programme was progressively reduced after the adoption of the 1971 UI Act. At the same time, the federal government gradually reduced its financial contribution, eliminating it entirely by 1990. The EI system was again cut by the Progressive Conservatives in 1990 and 1993, then by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] in 1994 and 1996. Amendments made it harder to qualify by increasing the time needed to be worked, although seasonal claimants (who work long hours over short periods) turned out to gain from the replacement, in 1996, of weeks by hours to qualify. The ratio of beneficiaries to unemployed, after having stood at around 40 percent for many years, rose somewhat during the 2009 recession but then fell back again to the low 40s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/jobs/ei/reports/mar2012/index.shtml |title= 2012 EI Monitoring and Assessment Report (Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, March 2013)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some unemployed persons are not covered for benefits (e.g. self-employed workers), while others may have exhausted their benefits, did not work long enough to qualify, or quit or were dismissed from their job. The length of time one could take EI has also been cut repeatedly. The 1994 and 1996 changes contributed to a sharp fall in Liberal support in the Atlantic provinces in the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 election]].

In 2001, the federal government increased parental leave from 10 to 35 weeks, which was added to preexisting maternity benefits of 15 weeks. In 2004, it allowed workers to take EI for compassionate care leave while caring for a dying relative, although the strict conditions imposed make this a little used benefit. In 2006, the Province of Quebec opted out of the federal EI scheme in respect of maternity, parental and adoption benefits, in order to provide more generous benefits for all workers in that province, including self-employed workers. Total EI spending was $19.677 billion for 2011-2012 (figures in [[Canadian dollar]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/cpc-pac/2012/index-eng.html |title= Public Accounts of Canada for 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers contribute 1.4 times the amount of employee premiums. Since 1990, there is no government contribution to this fund. The amount a person receives and how long they can stay on EI varies with their previous salary, how long they were working, and the unemployment rate in their area. The EI system is managed by [[Service Canada]], a service delivery network reporting to the Minister of [[Employment and Social Development Canada]].

A bit over half of EI benefits are paid in Ontario and the Western provinces but EI is especially important in the Atlantic provinces, which have higher rates of unemployment. Many Atlantic workers are also employed in seasonal work such as fishing, forestry or tourism and go on EI over the winter when there is no work. There are special rules for fishermen making it easier for them to collect EI. EI also pays for [[Parental leave|maternity and parental leave]], [[compassionate care leave]], and illness coverage. The programme also pays for retraining programmes (EI Part II) through labour market agreements with the Canadian provinces.

A significant part of the federal fiscal surplus of the [[Jean Chrétien]] and [[Paul Martin]] years came from the EI system. Premiums were reduced much less than falling expenditures - producing, from 1994 onwards, EI surpluses of several billion dollars per year, which were added to general government revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.actuaries.ca/members/publications/2007/207111e.pdf |title= A Look Back and A Way Forward: Actuarial Views on the Future of the Employment Insurance System, page 14(Canadian Institute of Actuaries, Nov. 2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cumulative EI surplus stood at $57 billion at 31 March 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/pdf/49-eng.pdf |title= Public Accounts of Canada, 2008, page 4.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly four times the amount needed to cover the extra costs paid during a recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.actuaries.ca/members/publications/2007/207111e.pdf |title= A Look Back and A Way Forward: Actuarial Views on the Future of the Employment Insurance System, page 8 (Canadian Institute of Actuaries, Nov. 2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This drew criticism from Opposition parties and from business and labour groups, and has remained a recurring issue of the public debate. The [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/Content/HOC/committee/381/huma/reports/rp1624652/humarp03/humarp03-e.pdf |title= Restoring Financial Governance and Accessibility n the Employment Insurance Program - Report of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills Development, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, page 59: Dissenting Opinion, Conservative Party of Canada - Peter Van Loan, M.P., York-Simcoe - CPC HRSDC Critic - February 09, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; chose not to recognize those EI surpluses after [[Canadian federal election, 2006|being elected in 2006]]. Instead, the Conservative government cancelled the EI surpluses entirely in 2010, and required EI contributors to make up the 2009, 2010 and 2011 annual deficits by increasing EI premiums. On 11 December 2008, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] rejected a court challenge launched against the federal government by two Quebec unions, who argued that EI funds had been misappropriated by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2008/2008scc68/2008scc68.html |title= Text of judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada on Employment Insurance surpluses - Confédération des syndicats nationaux v.

==Denmark==
{{Main article|Unemployment benefits in Denmark}}
==European Union==
{{See also|European unemployment insurance}}
Each Member State of the European Union has its own system and in general a worker should claim unemployment benefits in the country where they last worked. For a person working in a country other than their country of residency (a cross-border worker), they will have to claim benefits in their country of residence.&lt;ref name="europa"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/unemployment-and-benefits/social-security/index_en.htm |title= Social security systems in the EU |website=Europa |date= 21 Mar 2018 |accessdate= 5 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland==
Two systems run in parallel, combining a [[Ghent system]] and a minimum level of support provided by [[Kela (Finnish)|Kela]], an agency of the national government. Unionization rates are high (70%), and union membership comes with membership in an unemployment fund. Additionally, there are non-union unemployment funds. Usually benefits require 26 weeks of 18 hours per week on average, and the unemployment benefit is 60% of the salary and lasts for 500 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preconditions of earnings-related daily allowancet|url=http://en.ytk.fi/benefits-abc/preconditions-of-earnings-related-daily-allowance/other-preconditions|publisher=YTK|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this is not available, Kela can pay either regular unemployment benefit or labor market subsidy benefits. The former requires a degree and two years of full-time work. The latter requires participation in training, education, or other employment support, which may be mandated on pain of losing the benefit, but may be paid after the regular benefits have been either maxed out or not available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unemployment|url=http://www.kela.fi/in/internet/english.nsf/NET/081101150015EH?OpenDocument|publisher=KELA|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the unemployment funds handle the payments, most of the funding is from taxes and compulsory tax-like unemployment insurance charges.

Regardless of whether benefits are paid by Kela or from an unemployment fund, the unemployed person receives assistance from the ''Työ- ja elinkeinokeskus'' (''TE-keskus'', or the "Work and Livelihood Centre"), a government agency which helps people to find jobs and employers to find workers. In order to be considered unemployed, the seeker must register at the TE-keskus as unemployed. If the jobseeker does not have degree, the agency can require the jobseeker to apply to a school.

If the individual does not qualify for any unemployment benefit he may still be eligible for the housing benefit (''asumistuki'') from Kela and municipal social welfare provisions (''toimeentulotuki''). They are not unemployment benefits and depend on household income, but they have in practice become the basic income of many long-term unemployed.

==France==
{{Main article|Unemployment benefits in France}}
[[France]] uses a quasi [[Ghent system]], under which unemployment benefits are distributed by an independent agency (UNEDIC) in which [[trade union|unions]] and Employer organisations are equally represented. UNEDIC is responsible for 3 benefits: ARE, ACA and ASR The main ARE scheme requires a minimum of 122 days membership in the preceding 24 months and certain other requirements before any claims can be made. Employers pay a contribution on top of the pre-tax income of their employees, which together with the employee contribution, fund the scheme.

The maximum unemployment benefit is (as of March 2009) 57.4% of [[EUR]] 162 per day (Social security contributions ceiling in 2011), or 6900 euros per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} http://www.pole-emploi.fr/candidat/le-montant-de-votre-allocation-@/suarticle.jspz?id=4125&lt;/ref&gt; Claimants receive 57,4% of their average daily salary of the last 12 months preceding unemployment with the average amount being 1,111 euros per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} http://entreprise.lefigaro.fr/chomeurs-unedic.html&lt;/ref&gt; In France tax and other payroll taxes are paid on unemployment benefits. In 2011 claimants received the allowance for an average 291 days.

==Germany==
[[Germany]] has two different types of unemployment benefits.

=== Unemployment benefit I ===

The ''unemployment benefit I'' in [[Germany]] is also known as the unemployment insurance. The insurance is administered by the federal employment agency and funded by employee and employer contributions. This in stark contrast to FUTA in the US and other systems; where only employers make contributions. Participation (and thus contributions) are generally mandatory for both employee and employer.

All workers with a regular employment contract (''abhängig Beschäftigte''), except freelancers and certain civil servants (''Beamte''), contribute to the system. Since 2006, certain previously excluded workers have been able to opt into the system on a voluntary basis.

The system is financed by contributions from employees and employers. Employees pay 1.5% of their gross salary below the social security threshold and employers pay 1.5% contribution on top of the salary paid to the employee. The contribution level was reduced from 3.25% for employees and employers as part of labour market reforms known as Hartz. Contributions are paid only on earnings up to the social security ceiling (2012: 5,600 EUR).

The system is largely self-financed but also receives a subsidy from the state to run the Jobcenters.

Unemployed workers are entitled to:
* Living allowance known as unemployment benefit
* Help in finding work
* Training

Unemployed benefit is paid to workers who have contributed at least during 12 months preceding their loss of a job. The allowance is paid for half of the period that the worker has contributed. Claimants get 60% of their previous net salary (capped at the social security ceiling), or 67% for claimants with children. The maximum benefit is therefore 2964 Euros (in 2012).
In 2011 the federal Work Agency had revenues and expenses of 37.5 bn EUR&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.arbeitsagentur.de/zentraler-Content/Veroeffentlichungen/Intern/Geschaeftsbericht-2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531155700/http://www.arbeitsagentur.de/zentraler-Content/Veroeffentlichungen/Intern/Geschaeftsbericht-2011.pdf |archivedate=31 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a change in German law effective since 2008, provided their job history qualifies them, benefit recipients aged 50 to 54 now receive an unemployment benefit for 15 months, those 55 to 57 for 18 months and those 58 or older receive benefits for 24 months. For those under the age of 50 who have not been employed for more than 30 months in a job which paid into the social security scheme, full unemployment benefit can be received for a maximum period of 12 months. Note how the duration of eligibility is variegated in Germany to account for the difficulty older people have re-entering the job market.

=== Unemployment benefit II ===
{{Main article|Hartz concept}}
If a worker is not eligible for the full unemployment benefits or after receiving the full unemployment benefit for the maximum of 12 months, he is able to apply for benefits from the so-called Arbeitslosengeld II (Hartz IV) programme, an open-ended welfare programme which ensures people do not fall into penury. A person receiving Hartz IV benefits is paid 404 EUR &lt;small&gt;(2016)&lt;/small&gt; a month for living expenses plus the cost of adequate housing (including heating) and health care. Couples can receive benefits for each partner including their children. Additionally, children can get "benefits for education and participation". Germany does not have an EBT (electronic benefits transfer) card system in place and, instead, disburses welfare in cash or via direct deposit onto the recipient's bank account. People who receive Hartz 4 are obligated to seek for jobs and can be forced to take part in social programs or [[Mini jobs]] in order to receive this Hartz 4 money. Most of these programs and Mini jobs oblige the employee to work the same hours as a normal full-time job each day, 5 days a week. 

==Greece==
Unemployment benefits in Greece are administered through OAED ({{Lang-el|Οργανισμός Απασχόλησης Εργατικού Δυναμικού}}, Manpower Employment Organization) and are available only to laid-off salaried workers with full employment and social security payments during the previous two years. The self-employed do not qualify, and neither do those with other sources of income. The monthly benefit is fixed at the "55% of 25 minimum daily wages", and is currently 360 [[euro]]s per month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-19289566 |title=Greeks go back to basics as recession bites |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OAEDbenefits&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oaed.gr/en/2012-02-07-18-31-19/2012-02-07-18-31-52/2012-07-03-09-22-05 |publisher=ΟΑΕΔ |title=OAED Unemployment Benefits (in Greek)}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a 10% increase for each under-age child. Recipients are eligible for at most twelve months; the exact duration depends on the collected number of ensema ''ένσημα'', that is social security payment coupons-stamps collected (i.e. days of work) during the 14 months before being laid off; the minimum number of such coupons, under which there is no eligibility, is 125, collected in the first 12 of the 14 aforementioned months. Eligibility since 1 January 2013, has been further constrained in that one applying for unemployment benefits for a second or more time, must not have received more than the equivalent of 450 days of such benefits during the last four years since the last time one had started receiving such benefits; if one has received unemployment benefits in this period for more than 450 days then there is no eligibility while if one has received less, then one is only eligible for at most the remaining days up until the maximum of 450 days is reached.&lt;ref name=OAEDbenefits /&gt;

In terms of an unemployment allowance, Greece allows for those found in unemployment, who are employed through an independent profession, to receive benefits if their latest paycheck had not exceed a certain amount, the current rate should not exceed € 1,467.35. When receiving benefits an individual cannot be earning money from a self-employed profession. If the income increases the fixed amount, a tax authority must issue a certificate that explains that the individual has "interrupted the exercise of the profession", which must be done within 15 days.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oaed.gr/sychnes-eroteseis-epidomata-paroches|title=Συχνές Ερωτήσεις Επιδόματα Παροχές|website=Οργαισμοσ Απαχολησησ Εργατικου Δυναμικου|language=el-GR|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment benefits are also granted to those who have generated an income that does not exceed €1,467.35 from the final paycheck received from a liberal profession. In order to receive a grant the individual must not be receiving an income from the previous liberal profession. Under the [[European Commission]], liberal professions are professions that require specialized training and that are regulated by "national governments or professional bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/promoting-entrepreneurship/we-work-for/liberal-professions_en|title=Liberal professions - Growth - European Commission|website=Growth|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seasonal aid is also provided to workers whose jobs cannot be performed through the entire year are also provided benefits by the OAED. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1112&amp;langId=en&amp;intPageId=4571|title=Greece - Employment, Social Affairs &amp; Inclusion - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the OAED, individuals who are benefiting from long-term unemployment must be within the ages of 20 to 66 years of age and have a family income that does not exceed € 10,000 annually.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; An individual becomes eligible for long-term benefits if the regular unemployment subsidy is exhausted after 12 months. After the expiration of the 12-month period an application towards long-term unemployment benefits must be submitted in the first 2 months.

Long-term unemployment can only be granted if the individual can be found registered under the OAED unemployment registrar.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;

== Iceland ==
To receive [[unemployment]] benefits in [[Iceland]], one must submit an application to the Directorate of Labour (''Vinnumálastofnun'') and meet a specific criteria set forth by the department.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcc.is/english/work/unemployment-benefits/|title=Unemployment Benefits {{!}} Fjölmenningarsetur|website=www.mcc.is|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icelandic [[Employment rate|employment rates]] have traditionally been higher than every other [[OECD]] country. In the most recent financial quarter, 85.8 percent of the [[Iceland|Icelandic]] working-age population were employed, with only 2.8 percent of the population unemployed.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.oecd.org/emp/employment-rate.htm|title=Employment - Employment rate - OECD Data|website=theOECD|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; When broken down by age group, [[Iceland|Iceland's]] labor force is highly active, with 74.9 percent of the population between the ages of 15 to 24 years old and 89.4 percent of people between the ages of 25 to 55 years old active in the labor market.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This low rate of [[unemployment]] is attributed to the adoption of the [[Ghent system]], which has been adopted by the countries of [[Denmark]], [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]], and highly emphasizes [[Trade union|trade and labor unions]] to provide unemployment benefits and protections to workers, which ultimately has led to higher union membership than other [[Capitalist economics|capitalist economies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scruggs|first=Lyle|date=1 June 2002|title=The Ghent System and Union Membership in Europe, 1970-1996|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/106591290205500201|journal=Political Research Quarterly, University of Connecticut|volume=|pages=275-297|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The safety net that these unions provide also leads to more stable job retention and less reliance on [[Part-time contract|part-time]] employment. Only 11.9 percent of the working population is dependent on [[Temporary work|temporary employment]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Unlike purely [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] states in [[Europe]], the [[Nordic model]] that [[Iceland]] adopted borrows aspects of both a [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] and [[Economic liberalism|liberal]]-[[welfare state]].&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalisms Compared|last=Bowman|first=John R.|publisher=CQPress|year=1952|isbn=|location=|pages=12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iceland]] not only sees high government involvement in providing [[Welfare|social welfare]] and amenities as with the [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] model, but like the [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[Welfare state|welfare]] model, it is also heavily reliant on [[free trade]] and markets.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The country relies on an open [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] market for economic growth, yet also embraces a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] system that allows for wage bargaining to occur between the labor force and employers in order to protect workers and ensure provisions like [[unemployment]] benefits are ensured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://economics.mit.edu/files/5726|title=The Nordic Model|last=Andersen, Holmström, Honkapohja, Korkman, Söderström, Vartiainen|first=|date=2007|website=|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the [[legislation]] that ensures these benefits is The Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which was adopted in 1938 and has been amended five times since its inception to adjust to the rise of [[globalization]]. In Section 1, Articles 1-13 grant [[Trade union|trade unions]] the right to organize and negotiate with employers over fair wages for its members as well as representation for their members in the event of workplace conflicts.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asi.is/media/249303/l-80_1938.pdf|title=Act of Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes|last=|first=|date=2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights for organized [[Trade union|unions]] set forth by the [[Ministry of Welfare (Iceland)|Ministry of Welfare]] not only provide the country's labor force fair and equal representation within their respective industries, but also allow for these organizations to maintain an active relationship with the [[Politics of Iceland|Icelandic government]] to discuss economic issues, promote labor and social equality, and ensure benefits for unemployed laborers, as these [[Trade union|unions]] are highly centralized and not [[Political affiliation|politically affiliated]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unemployment benefits in [[Iceland]] (''atvinnuleysisbætur'') can involve up to 100 percent reimbursement per month for wage earners for a maximum of 30 months.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.a-kasser.dk/unemployment-insurance-in-europe/iceland/|title=Unemployment benefits in Iceland|website=www.a-kasser.dk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these rates of reimbursement are determined by previous status of employment, such as whether an individual is a [[Wage earner|wage-earner]] or is [[Self-employment|self-employed]], as well as meeting certain mandates such as being a current resident of [[Iceland]], be actively searching for employment, and retaining a 25 percent position for three months within the past 12 months before filing for [[unemployment]]. &lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Unemployed workers can be compensated through either basic or income-linked benefits.

== Ireland ==
People aged 18 and over and who are unemployed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] can apply for either the Jobseeker's Allowance (''Liúntas do Lucht Cuardaigh Fostaíochta'') or the Jobseeker's Benefit (''Sochar do Lucht Cuardaigh Fostaíochta''). Both are paid by the [[Department of Social Protection]] and are nicknamed "the dole".

Unemployment benefit in Ireland can be claimed indefinitely for as long as the individual remains unemployed. The standard payment is €193 per week for those aged 26 and over. For those aged 18 to 24 the rate is €100 per week. For those aged 25 the weekly rate is €144. Payments can be increased if the unemployed has dependents. For each adult dependent, another €124.80 is added, €100 if the recipient (as opposed to the dependent) is aged 18 to 24, and for each child dependent €29.80 is added.

There are more benefits available to unemployed people, usually on a special or specific basis. Benefits include the ''Rent Supplement'', the ''Mortgage Interest Supplement'' and the ''Fuel Allowance'', among others. People on a low income (which includes those on JA/JB) are entitled to a Medical Card (although this must be applied for separately from the [[Health Service Executive]]) which provides free health care, optical care, limited dental care, aural care and subsidised prescription drugs carrying a €2.50 per item charge to a maximum monthly contribution of €25 per household (as opposed to subsidised services like non medical-card holders).

To qualify for Jobseekers Allowance, claimants must satisfy the "Habitual Residence Condition": they must have been legally in the state (or the [[Common Travel Area]]) for two years or have another good reason (such as lived abroad and are returning to Ireland after become unemployed or deported). This condition does not apply to Jobseekers Benefit (which is based on Social Insurance payments).

==Israel==
{{See also|Welfare in Israel}}
In [[Israel]], unemployment benefits are paid by [[Bituah Leumi]] (the National Insurance Institute), to which workers must pay contributions. Eligible workers must immediately register with the Employment Service Bureau upon losing their jobs or jeopordize their eligibility, and the unemployment period is considered to start upon registration with the Employment Service Bureau. To be eligible for unemployment benefits, an employee must have completed a "qualifying period" of work for which unemployment insurance contributions were paid, which varies between 300 and 360 days. Employees who were involuntarily terminated from their jobs or who terminated their own employment and can provide evidence of having done so for a justified reason are eligible for immediately receiving unemployment benefits, while those who are deemed to have terminated their employment of their own volition with no justified reason will only begin receiving unemployment benefits 90 days from the start of their unemployment period.&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il"&gt;https://www.btl.gov.il/English%20Homepage/Benefits/Unemployment%20Insurance/periodofentitlement/Pages/numberofdays.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il1"&gt;https://www.btl.gov.il/English%20Homepage/Benefits/Unemployment%20Insurance/Pages/Conditionsofeligibility.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il2"&gt;https://www.btl.gov.il/English%20Homepage/Benefits/Unemployment%20Insurance/Amount/Pages/Benefitrates.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unemployment benefits are paid daily, with the amount calculated based on the employee's previous income over the past six months, but not exceeding the daily average wage for the first 125 days of payment and two-thirds of the daily average wage from the 126th day onwards. During the unemployment period, the Employment Service Bureau assists in helping locate suitable work and job training, and regularly reporting to the Employment Service Bureau is a condition for continuing to receive unemployment benefits. A person who was offered suitable work or training by the Employment Service Bureau but refused will only receive unemployment benefits 90 days after the date of the refusal, and 30 days' worth of unemployment benefits will be deducted for each subsequent refusal.&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il"/&gt;&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il2"/&gt;

Members of [[kibbutz]]im and [[moshav]]im are typically not covered by the national unemployment system and are covered by the community's own social welfare system, unless they are employed outside of their community or directly by the community.

==Italy==
{{Main article|Unemployment benefits in Italy}}
Unemployment benefits in [[Italy]] consists mainly in cash transfers based on [[contributions]] (''Assicurazione Sociale per l'Impiego, ASPI''), up to the 75 percent of the previous wages for up to sixteen months. Other measures are:
* Redundancy Fund (''Cassa integrazione guadagni'', or CIG): cash benefits provided as [[shock absorbers]] to those workers who are suspended or who work only for reduced time due to temporary difficulties of their factories, aiming to help the factories in financial difficulties, by relieving them from the costs of unused workforce
* Solidarity Contracts (''Contratti di solidarietà''): in the same cases granting CIG benefits, companies can sign contracts with reduced work time, to avoid dismissing redundancy workers. The state will grant to those workers the 60 percent of the lost part of the wage.
* Mobility allowances (''Indennità di mobilità''),: if the Redundancy Fund does not allow the company to re-establish a good financial situation, the workers can be entitled to mobility allowances. Other companies are provided [[incentive]]s for employing them. This measure has been abolished in 2012 and will stop working in 2017.
In the Italian unemployment insurance system all the measures are [[income]]-related, and they have an average [[decommodification]] level. The basis for entitlement is always [[employment]], with more specific conditions for each case, and the provider is quite always the state. An interesting feature worthy to be discussed is that the Italian system takes in consideration also the economic situation of the employers, and aims as well at relieving them from the costs of crisis.

==Japan==
{{Main article|Unemployment insurance (Japan)}}
Unemployment benefits in Japan are called "unemployment insurance" and are closer to the US or Canadian "user pays" system than the taxpayer funded systems in place in countries such as Britain, New Zealand, or Australia. It is paid for by contributions by both the employer and employee.&lt;ref&gt;Tokyo Employment Service Centre for Foreigners website [http://www.tfemploy.go.jp/en/spec/spec_1d.html For foreign nationals working in Japan] Retrieved on 23 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On leaving a job, employees are supposed to be given a "Rishoku-hyo" document showing their ID number (the same number is supposed to be used by later employers), employment periods, and pay (which contributions are linked to). The reason for leaving is also documented separately. These items affect eligibility, timing, and amount of benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justlanded.com/english/Japan/Japan-Guide/Jobs/Employment-insurance|title=Employment insurance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of time that unemployed workers can receive benefits depends on the age of the employee, and how long they have been employed and paying in.&lt;ref&gt;Nagoya International Center [http://www.nic-nagoya.or.jp/en/e/2010/09/09/unemployment-insurance-3/ Insurance] Retrieved on 23 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

It is supposed to be compulsory for most full-time employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jil.go.jp/english/laborinfo/library/documents/llj_law11.pdf|title=Employment Insurance Law (Japan)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they have been enrolled for at least 6 months and are fired or made redundant, leave the company at the end of their contract, or their contract is non-renewed, the now-unemployed worker will receive unemployment insurance. If a worker quit of their own accord they may have to wait between 1 and 3 months before receiving any payment.

==Mexico==
[[Mexico]] lacks a national unemployment insurance system, but it does have five programs to assist the unemployed: 

* Mexico City Unemployment Benefit Scheme - The only unemployment insurance system based on worker contributions exists in [[Mexico City]]. Unemployed residents of Mexico City who are at least 18 years of age, have worked for at least six months, have no income, and are actively seeking work are eligible for unemployment benefits for up to six months, which are composed of payments of 30 days' worth of minimum wage per month.&lt;ref name=careeraddict&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.careeraddict.com/claim-unemployment-benefits-in-mexico|title=How to Claim Unemployment Benefits in Mexico|first=Amy|last=Theodore|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (IMSS) - This institution insures workers in the formal sector, providing pensions and health insurance. Workers insured by the IMSS who are unemployed may withdraw a maximum of 30 days' worth of pension savings every five years.&lt;ref name=careeraddict/&gt; However, this does not cover the majority of workers, as 58% of the labor force is in the informal sector.

* National Employment Service - This agency, which has 165 offices nationwide, offers financial support in learning new skills to those aged 16 and above who are unemployed or underemployed, and assistance in finding new jobs in the form of information on vacancies and job fairs.&lt;ref name=careeraddict/&gt;

* Temporary Employment Program - This scheme is designed to aid unemployed people who live in rural areas with high unemployment rates, any area undergoing a financial crisis, or an area that has been hit by a natural disaster or some other kind of emergency. The program funds projects to boost employment by hiring local workers aged 16 and above in jobs such as building infrastructure and promoting development, and conserving the environment and cultural heritage sites. They are paid a salary at 99% of the local minimum wage for a maximum of 132 days a year.&lt;ref name=careeraddict/&gt;

* Income Generating Options Program - People living in poverty in an area of up to a maximum of 15,000 inhabitants are eligible for funding for projects to generate income for themselves.&lt;ref name=careeraddict/&gt;

==Netherlands==
Unemployment benefits in the Netherlands were introduced in 1949. Separate schemes exist for mainland Netherlands and for the [[Caribbean Netherlands]].

The scheme in mainland Netherlands entails that, according to the Werkloosheidswet (Unemployment Law, WW), employers are responsible for paying the contributions to the scheme, which are deducted from the salary received by the employees. In 2012 the contribution was 4.55% of gross salary up to a ceiling of 4,172 euros per month. The first 1,435.75 euros of an employees gross salaries are not subject to the 4.55% contribution.

Benefits are paid for a maximum period of 38 months and claimants get 75% of last salary for 2 months and 70% thereafter with a maximum benefit of 3128 euros, depending on how long the claimant has been employed previously. Workers older than 50 years who are unemployed for over 2 months are entitled to a special benefit called the IOAW, if they do not receive the regular unemployment benefit (WW).

==New Zealand==
{{Main article|Social welfare in New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]], Jobseeker Support, previously known as the Unemployment Benefit and also known as "the dole" provides income support for people who are looking for work or training for work. It is one of a number of benefits administered by [[Work and Income]], a service of the Ministry of Social Development.

To get this benefit, a person must meet the conditions and obligations specified in section 88A to 123D Social Security Act 1964. These conditions and obligations cover things such as age, residency status, and availability to work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/manuals-and-procedures/income_support/main_benefits/unemployment_benefit/unemployment_benefit.htm Unemployment Benefit] Manuals and Procedures - Work and Income website&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount that is paid depends on things such as the person's age, income, marital status and whether they have children. It is adjusted annually on 1 April and in response to changes in legislature. Some examples of the maximum after tax weekly rate at 1 April 2011 are:
* $175.10 for a single person aged 20–24 years without children
* $210.13 for a single person 25 years or over
* $325.98 for a sole parent
* $350.20 for a married, de facto or civil union couple with or without children ($167.83 each).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/forms-and-brochures/benefit-rates-april-2011.html|title=Work and Income Unemployment Benefit Rates|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
{{Main article|Unemployment benefits in Spain}}
The Spanish unemployment benefits system is part of the [[Social Security in Spain|Social security system of Spain]]. Benefits are managed by the State Public Employment Agency (SEPE).The basis for entitlement is having contributed for a minimum period during the time preceding unemployment, with further conditions that may be applicable. The system comprises contributory benefits and non-contributory benefits.

Contributory benefits are payable to those unemployed persons with a minimum of 12 months contributions over a period of 6 years preceding unemployment. The benefit is payable for 1/3 of the contribution period. The benefit amount is 70% of the legal reference salary plus additional amounts for persons with dependants. The benefit reduces to 60% of the reference salary after 6 months. The minimum benefit is 497 euros per month and the maximum is 1087,20 euros per month for a single person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ayudasparados.com/importe-maximo-desempleo-2012/105|title=importe maximo desempleo 2018 - Ayudas a Parados|website=www.ayudasparados.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-contributory allowance is available to those persons who are no longer entitled to the contributory pension and who do not have income above 75% of the national minimum wage.

==Sweden==
{{Main article|Unemployment benefits in Sweden}}
[[Sweden]] uses the [[Ghent system]], under which a significant proportion of unemployment benefits are distributed by [[trade union|union]] unemployment funds. Unemployment benefits are divided into a voluntary scheme with income related compensation up to a certain level and a comprehensive scheme that provides a lower level of basic support. The voluntary scheme requires a minimum of 12 months membership and 6 months employment during that time before any claims can be made. Employers pay a fee on top of the pre-tax income of their employees, which together with membership fees, fund the scheme (see [[Unemployment funds in Sweden]]).

The maximum unemployment benefit is (as of July 2016) [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 980 per day. During the first 200 days the unemployed will receive 80 percent of his or her normal income during the last 12 months. From day 201-300 this goes down to 70 percent and from day 301-450 the insurance covers 65 percent of the normal income (only available for parents to children under the age of 18). In Sweden tax is paid on unemployment benefits, so the unemployed will get a maximum of about SEK 10,000 per month during the first 100 days (depending on the [[municipality]] tax rate). In other currencies, as of June 2017, this means a maximum of approximately £900, $1,150, or [[€]]1,000, each month after tax. Private insurance is also available, mainly through professional organisations, to provide income related compensation that otherwise exceeds the ceiling of the scheme. The comprehensive scheme is funded by tax.

==Saudi Arabia==
[[Saudi Arabia]] is an economic [[welfare state]] with free medical care&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.gov.sa/Detail.asp?InSectionID=1516&amp;InNewsItemID=1746|title=Request Rejected|website=www.mofa.gov.sa}}&lt;/ref&gt; and unemployment benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saudinf.com/main/h814.htm|title=Social Services (2) - SAMIRAD (Saudi Arabia Market Information Resource)|website=saudinf.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the country relies not on taxation but mainly [[oil]] revenues to maintain the social and economic services to its populace.

Payment:
2000 SAR (USD $534) for only 12 months for unemployed person from ages 18–35

==Turkey==
By law, legally employed workers, regardless of their citizenship are eligible for unemployment benefits given that they are at least 18 years old, the employees contribute 1% to unemployment funds while the employers contribute 2%, and the workers are eligible to receive benefits after 600 days of contributions within the preceding 3 years of employment. the benefit payment is 50% for the average daily earnings based on the last 4 months and cannot be higher than the mimimum wage (per industry). Benefits may be paid for a max of 1,080 days depending on the number of contributions. some are skeptical of how well the system is functioning in turkey&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justlanded.com/english/Turkey/Turkey-Guide/Jobs/Social-security-in-Turkey&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jobseeker's Allowance rates===
JSA for a single person is changed annually, and at 3 August 2012 the maximum payable was [[£]]71.00 per week for a person aged over 25 and £56.25 per week for a person aged 18–24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jobseeker's Allowance|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_200090.html|publisher=Directgov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules for couples where both are unemployed are more complex, but a maximum of £112.55 per week is payable, dependent on age and other factors. Income-based JSA is reduced for people with savings of over £6,000, by a reduction of £1 per week per £250 of savings, up to £16,000. People with savings of over £16,000 are not able to get IB-JSA at all.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Benefit &amp; Tax Credit Rates 2006 — © [[Citizens Advice Bureau]] (United Kingdom) and the [[Child Poverty Action Group]]&lt;/ref&gt; The British system provides rent payments as part of a separate scheme called [[Housing Benefit]].

Unemployment benefit is commonly referred to as "the dole"; to receive the benefit is to be "on the dole". "Dole" here is an archaic expression meaning "one's allotted portion", from the synonymous [[Old English]] word ''dāl''.

In the United States, there are 50 state unemployment insurance programs plus one each in the [[District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[United States Virgin Islands]]. Though policies vary by state, unemployment benefits generally pay eligible workers as high as $783.00 per week in the [[Massachusetts]] to a low as $235 per week maximum in [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aboutunemployment.org/faqs/best-and-worst-states-for-unemployment-benefits/|title=Best and Worst States for Unemployment Benefits - 2017 {{!}} AboutUnemployment.org|website=aboutunemployment.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits are generally paid by state governments, funded in large part by state and federal payroll taxes levied against employers, to workers who have become unemployed through no fault of their own. Eligibility requirements for unemployment insurance vary by state, but generally speaking, employees not fired for misconduct ("terminated for cause") are eligible for unemployment benefits, while those fired for misconduct (this sometimes can include misconduct committed outside the workplace, such as a problematic social media post or committing a crime) are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-wrongful-termination-2061658|title=How to Handle a Wrongful Termination|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In every state, employees who quit their job without "good cause" are not eligible for unemployment benefits, but the definition of good cause varies by state. In some states, being fired for misconduct permanently bars the employee from receiving unemployment benefits, while in others it only disqualifies the employee for a short period. This compensation is classified as a type of social welfare benefit. According to the [[Internal Revenue Code]], these types of benefits are to be included in a taxpayer's gross income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tax Topics - Topic 418 Unemployment Compensation |work=Internal Revenue Service |url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc418.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard time-length of unemployment compensation is six months, although extensions are possible during economic downturns. During the [[Great Recession]], unemployment benefits were extended to 73 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-long-unemployment-benefits-now-last-in-each-state-2014-1|title=Here's How Long Unemployment Benefits Now Last In Each State|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court held that federal unemployment law is constitutional and does not violate the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] in ''[[Steward Machine Company v. Davis]]'', [[Case citation|301 U.S. 548]] (1937).

===Federal-state joint programs===

Unemployment insurance is a federal-state program financed through federal and state payroll taxes (federal and state UI taxes).&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/uitaxtopic.asp|title=Unemployment Insurance Tax Topic, Employment &amp; Training Administration (ETA) - U.S. Department of Labor|website=workforcesecurity.doleta.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most states employers pay state and federal unemployment taxes if:

:(1) they pay wages to employees totaling $1,500 or more in any quarter of a calendar year; or,&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt;
:(2) they had at least one employee during any day of a week during 20 weeks in a calendar year, regardless of whether the weeks were consecutive. Some state laws differ from the federal law.&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt;

To facilitate this program, the [[U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act]] (FUTA), which authorizes the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) to collect an annual federal employer tax used to fund state workforce agencies. FUTA covers the costs of administering the Unemployment Insurance and Job Service programs in all states. In addition, FUTA pays one-half of the cost of extended unemployment benefits which are triggered in periods of high state unemployment. FUTA also provides a fund from which states UI funds may borrow to pay benefits. As originally established, the states paid the federal government.&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt;

The FUTA tax rate was originally three percent of taxable wages collected from employers who employed at least four employees,&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 182"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmerman |first=Joseph  F. |title= ''State and Local Government''|year= 1970 |publisher= [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] |location=[[New York, New York]] |isbn= | pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; and employers could deduct up to 90 percent of the amount due if they paid taxes to a state to support a system of unemployment insurance which met Federal standards,&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 213"/&gt; but the rules have recently changed. The FUTA tax rate is now, as of 30 June 2011, 6.0 percent of taxable wages of employees who meet both the above and following criteria,&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt; and the taxable wage base is the first $7,000 paid in wages to each employee during a calendar year.&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt; Employers who pay the state unemployment tax on time receive an offset credit of up to 5.4 percent regardless of the rate of tax they pay their state. Therefore, the net FUTA tax rate is generally 0.6 percent (6.0 percent - 5.4 percent), for a maximum FUTA tax of $42.00 per employee, per year (.006 X $7,000 = $42.00). State law determines individual state unemployment insurance tax rates.&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt; In the United States, unemployment insurance tax rates use [[experience rating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/fth/lavape/9615.html|title=Unemployment Insurance Experience Rating of Firms and Layoffs|first1=P. Y.|last1=Cremieux|first2=M.|last2=Van Audenrode|date=6 May 1996|publisher=|via=ideas.repec.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the taxable wage base for each state/territory is at least $7,000 as mandated by FUTA, only four states or territories still remain at this minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanpayroll.org/members/stateui/state-ui-2/|title=State Unemployment Wage Bases|website=www.americanpayroll.org|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These states/territories include Arizona, California, Florida, and Puerto Rico. Florida and Puerto Rico maintain tax rates similar to those of other states, but Arizona and California both have a higher maximum tax rate. Florida's minimum tax rate is 0.1% and the state maximum is 5.4%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://floridarevenue.com/dor/taxes/reemployment.html#who|title=FL Dept Rev - Reemployment Tax|website=floridarevenue.com|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Puerto Rico, employers are taxed between 2.4% and 5.4% depending on their experience rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.payroll-taxes.com/state-tax/puerto-rico|title=Puerto Rico State Tax Information {{!}} Payroll Taxes|last=igor@platon.sk|first=Igor Mino,|website=www.payroll-taxes.com|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, Arizona's minimum was 0.03%, but its maximum was 7.79%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://des.az.gov/sites/default/files/ui_tax_rate_chart.pdf|title=Unemployment Insurance Tax Rates|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Arizona Department of Economic Security|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; California's tax rate on the taxable wage base is currently higher than the federal minimum of 6.0%. Employers are currently on a tax schedule that requires them to pay a minimum of 1.5% and a maximum 6.2% of the taxable wage base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edd.ca.gov/Payroll_Taxes/Rates_and_Withholding.htm|title=Rates and Withholding|last=Department|first=Employment Development|website=www.edd.ca.gov|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the federal tax credit of 5.4%, Arizona employers could end up paying $175 per employee ((.0779-.054) x $7,000) and California employers could pay $56 per employee ((.062-.054) x $7,000) versus the FUTA maximum of $42.

Within the above constraints, the individual [[U.S. state|states]] and territories raise their own contributions and run their own programs. The federal government sets broad guidelines for coverage and eligibility, but states vary in how they determine benefits and eligibility.

Federal rules are drawn by the [[United States Department of Labor]], Employment and Training Administration. For most states, the maximum period for receiving benefits is 26 weeks. There is an extended benefit program (authorized through the Social Security Acts) that may be triggered by the state unemployment rate. Congress has often passed temporary programs to extend benefits during recessions. This was done with the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation (TEUC) program in 2002-2003, which has since expired,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation |work=Employment &amp; Training Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |url= http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/factsheetteuc.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in force through 2 June 2010, with the Extended Unemployment Compensation 2008 legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Emergency Unemployment Compensation 2008 (EUC) Program |work=Employment &amp; Training Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |url= http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/euc08.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, legislation that provides an extension of federal extended unemployment benefits through November 2010 was signed by the president. The legislation extended benefits for 2.3 million unemployed workers who had exhausted their unemployment benefits.

The federal government lends money to the states for unemployment insurance when states run short of funds which happens when the state's UI fund cannot cover the cost of current benefits. A high unemployment rate shrinks UI tax revenues and increases expenditures on benefits. State UI finances and the need for loans are exacerbated when a state cuts taxes and increases benefits. FUTA loans to state funds are repaid with interest.

Congressional actions to increase penalties for states incurring large debts for unemployment benefits led to state fiscal crises in the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

One interesting feature of the UI tax is that it targets firms that have recently had layoffs, potentially hitting distressed firms. Recent work shows that UI tax increases significantly reduce hiring and employment in affected firms, potentially eroding the macroeconomics stabilizing influence of the UI program. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unemployment Insurance Taxes and Labor Demand: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Administrative Data |work=SSRN Repository |publisher=Working Paper |url= https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3062412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macroeconomic function ===
To Keynesians, unemployment insurance acts as an [[automatic stabilizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url= http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/1999/199964/199964pap.pdf |last1= Cohen| first1= Darrel| first2= Glenn| last2= Follette| title= The Automatic Fiscal Stabilizers: Quietly Doing Their Thing| location= Washington, DC| publisher= Divisions of Research &amp; Statistics and Monetary Affairs, [[Federal Reserve Board]]| year= 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits automatically increase when unemployment is high and fall when unemployment is low, smoothing the business cycle; however, others claim that the taxation necessary to support this system serves to decrease employment.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== Eligibility and amount ===
In order to receive benefits, a person must have worked for at least one quarter in the previous year and have been laid-off by an employer. Workers who were temporary or were paid under the table are not eligible for unemployment insurance. If a worker quits without good cause or is fired for misconduct, then they are normally not eligible for UI benefits. There are five common reasons a claim for unemployment benefits are denied: the worker is unavailable for work, the worker quit his or her job without good cause, the worker was fired for misconduct, refusing suitable work, and unemployment resulting from a labor dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unemployed Without Benefits: A Couple's Struggle |first=Kathy |last=Lohr |work=National Public Radio |date=14 January 2009 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99170822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://utahstaffingcompanies.com/helpful-tips-for-employers/unemployment-benefits-eligibility/&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, it is only practical to verify whether the worker quit or was fired. If the worker's claim is denied, then they have the right to appeal. If the worker was fired for misconduct, then the employer has the burden to prove that the termination of employment is a misconduct defined by individual states laws.&lt;ref name="ctdol.state.ct.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ctdol.state.ct.us/progsupt/unemplt/new-faqui.htm|title=Unemployment Insurance Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)|first=State of Connecticut Department of|last=Labor|website=www.ctdol.state.ct.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the employee quit their job, then they must prove that their voluntary separation must be good cause.

Generally, the worker must be unemployed through no fault of his/her own although workers often file for benefits they are not entitled to; when the employer demonstrates that the unemployed person quit or was fired for cause the worker is required to pay back the benefits they received. The unemployed person must also meet state requirements for wages earned or time worked during an established period of time (referred to as a “base period”) to be eligible for benefits. In most states, the base period is usually the first four out of the last five completed calendar quarters prior to the time that the claim is filed.&lt;ref name="State Unemployment Benefits"&gt;[http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/uifactsheet.asp State Unemployment Benefits] ''US Department of Labor''&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment benefits are based on reported covered quarterly earnings. The amount of earnings and the number of quarters worked are used to determine the length and value of the unemployment benefit. The average weekly in 2010 payment was $293.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/08/AR2010030804927.html|title=Are unemployment benefits no longer temporary?|last=Fletcher|first=Michael A.|date=9 March 2010|work=The Washington Post|last2=Hedgpeth|first2=Dana|access-date=2016-09-04|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] passed in February 2009, many unemployed people receive up to [[99ers|99 weeks]] of unemployment benefits; this may depend on State legislation. Before the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the maximum number of weeks allowed was 26.

=== Application process ===
It generally takes two weeks for benefit payments to begin, the first being a "waiting week", which is not reimbursed, and the second being the time lag between eligibility for the program and the first benefit actually being paid.

To begin a claim, the unemployed worker must apply for benefits through a state unemployment agency.&lt;ref name="State Unemployment Benefits"/&gt; In certain instances, the employer initiates the process. Generally, the certification includes the affected person affirming that they are "able and available for work", the amount of any part-time earnings they may have had, and whether they are actively seeking work. These certifications are usually accomplished either over the Internet or via an interactive voice response telephone call, but in a few states may be by mail. After receiving an application, the state will notify the individual if they qualify and the rate they will receive every week. The state will also review the reason for separation from employment. Many states require the individual to periodically certify that the conditions of the benefits are still met.

=== Disqualification/Appeals ===

If a worker's reason for separation from their last job is due to some reason other than a "lack of work," a determination will be made about whether they are eligible for benefits. Generally, all determinations of eligibility for benefits are made by the appropriate State under its law or applicable federal laws. If a worker is disqualified or denied benefits, they have the right to file an appeal within an established time-frame. The State will advise a worker of his or her appeal rights. An employer may also appeal a determination if they do not agree with the State's determination regarding the employee's eligibility.&lt;ref name="State Unemployment Benefits"/&gt; If the worker's claim is denied, then they have the right to appeal. If the worker was fired for misconduct, then the employer has the burden to prove substantially that the termination of employment is a misconduct defined by individual states laws.&lt;ref name="ctdol.state.ct.us"/&gt; However, if the employee quit their job, then they must prove that their voluntary separation must be good cause. Success rate of unemployment appeals is two-thirds, or 67% of the time for the most claimants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.workforce.com/articles/penny-wise-pound-foolish-on-unemployment-challenges

===Measurement===

==== Current data ====
Each Thursday, the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] issues the ''Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/ui/current.htm|title=ETA Press Release: Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report|website=www.dol.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its headline number is the seasonally adjusted estimate for the initial claims for unemployment for the previous week in the United States. This statistic, because it is published weekly, is depended on as a current indicator of the labor market and the economy generally.

In 2016, the number of people on unemployment benefits fell to around 1.74 the lowest in the last 4 decades.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_29795570/us-applications-jobless-aid-fall-four-decade-low?source=JPopUp|title=US applications for jobless aid fall to four-decade low|author=Josh Boak|date=21 April 2016|publisher=[[Denver Post]]|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unemployment insurance outlook ====
Twice a year, the Office of Management and Budget delivers an economic assessment of the unemployment insurance program as it relates to budgetary issues.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"&gt;[http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/content/prez_budget.asp UI Outlook: Overview] ''US Department of Labor''&lt;/ref&gt; As it relates to the FY 2012 budget, the OMB reports that the insured unemployment rate (IUR) is projected to average 3.6% in both FY 2011 and in FY 2012. State unemployment regular benefit outlays are estimated at $61 billion in FY 2011 and $64.3 billion in FY 2012, down somewhat from Midsession estimates.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt; Outlays from state trust fund accounts are projected to exceed revenues and interest income by $16.0 billion in FY 2011 and $15.1 billion in FY 2012.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt; State trust fund account balances, net of loans, are projected to continue to fall, from -$27.4 billion at the end of FY 2010 to -$62.7 billion at the end of FY 2013, before starting to grow again.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt; 

Net balances are not projected to become positive again until well beyond FY 2016. Up to 40 states are projected to continue borrowing heavily from the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA) over the next few years.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt; The aggregate loan balance is projected to increase from $40.2 billion at the end of FY 2010 to a peak end-of-year balance of $68.3 billion in FY 2013. Due to the high volume of state loans and increased EB payments, FUA and EUCA are projected to borrow $26.7 billion from the general fund in FY 2011 and an additional $19.4 billion in FY 2012, with neither account projected to return to a net positive balance before 2016.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt; The general fund advances must be repaid with interest.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt;

===Economic rationale and issues===
The economic argument for unemployment insurance comes from the principle of [[adverse selection]]. One common criticism of unemployment insurance is that it induces [[moral hazard]], the fact that unemployment insurance lowers on-the-job effort and reduces job-search effort.

====Adverse selection====
[[Adverse selection]] refers to the fact that “workers who have the highest probability of becoming unemployed have the highest demand for unemployment insurance.”&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 215"&gt;{{cite book|title=''Public Finance''|last=Rosen|first=Harvey S.|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-351128-3|location=New York, New York|pages=292|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse selection causes profit maximizing private insurance agencies to set high premiums for the insurance because there is a high likelihood they will have to make payments to the policyholder. High premiums work to exclude many individuals who otherwise might purchase the insurance. “A compulsory government program avoids the adverse selection problem. Hence, government provision of UI has the potential to increase efficiency. However, government provision does not eliminate moral hazard.”&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 215"/&gt;

====Moral hazard====
“At the same time, those workers who managed to obtain insurance might experience more unemployment otherwise would have been the case.”&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 215"/&gt; The private insurance company would have to determine whether the employee is unemployed through no fault of their own, which is difficult to determine. Incorrect determinations could result in the payout of significant amounts for fraudulent claims or alternately failure to pay legitimate claims. This leads to the rationale that if government could solve either problem that government intervention would increase efficiency.

====Unemployment insurance effect on unemployment====
In the [[Great Recession]], the “moral hazard” issue of whether unemployment insurance—and specifically extending benefits past the maximum 99 weeks—significantly encourages unemployment by discouraging workers from finding and taking jobs was expressed by Republican legislators. Conservative economist Robert Barro found that benefits raised the unemployment rate 2%.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Barro, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703959704575454431457720188 "The Folly of Subsidizing Unemployment"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', 30 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuylen-Wood/&gt; Disagreeing with Barro's study were Berkeley economist [[Jesse Rothstein]], who found the “vast majority” of unemployment was due to “demand shocks” not “[unemployment insurance]-induced supply reductions.”&lt;ref name=Zuylen-Wood&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/97971/would-extending-unemployment-benefits-increase-unemployment Would Extending Unemployment Benefits Increase Unemployment?].

A November 2011 report by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] found that even if unemployment benefits convince some unemployed to ignore job openings, these openings were quickly filled by new entrants into the labor market.&lt;ref name=Zuylen-Wood/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/124xx/doc12437/11-15-Outlook_Stimulus_Testimony.pdf Policies for Increasing Economic Growth and Employment] cbo.gov 15 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of studies on unemployment insurance's effect on employment by the [[Political Economy Research Institute]] found that unemployed who collected benefits did not find themselves out of work longer than those who ''didn’t'' have unemployment benefits; and that unemployed workers did not search for work more or reduce their wage expectations once their benefits ran out.&lt;ref name=Zuylen-Wood/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peri.umass.edu/236/hash/10dbb94dafa96d904bcaf546ee3b02a2/publication/456/ Unemployment Benefits and Work Incentives: The U.S. Labor Market in the Great Recession (revised), Howell, David R.; Azizoglu, Bert M.; [[Political Economy Research Institute]], 21 Mar 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

One concern over unemployment insurance increasing unemployment is based on experience rating benefit uses which can sometimes be imperfect. That is, the cost to the employer in increased taxes is less than the benefits that would be paid to the employee upon layoff. The firm in this instance believes that it is more cost effective to lay off the employee, causing more unemployment than under perfect experience rating.&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 215"/&gt;

====Unemployment insurance effect on employment====
An alternative rationale for unemployment insurance is that it may allow for improving the quality of matches between workers and firms. Marimon and Zilibotti argued that although a more generous unemployment benefit system may indeed increase the unemployment rate, it may also help improve the average match quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1468-0297.00432 | volume=109 | issue=455 | title=Unemployment vs. Mismatch of Talents: Reconsidering Unemployment Benefits | year=1999 | journal=The Economic Journal | pages=266–291 | last1 = Marimon | first1 = Ramon | subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar point is made by Mazur who analyzed the welfare and inequality effects of a policy reform giving entitlement for unemployment insurance to quitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |subscription=y |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.07.001 |title=Can welfare abuse be welfare improving? |journal=Journal of Public Economics |volume=141 |pages=11 |year=2016 |last1=Mazur |first1=Karol }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arash Nekoei and Andrea Weber present empirical evidence from Austria that extending unemployment benefit duration raises wages by improving reemployment firm quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1257/aer.20150528 | subscription=y | volume=107 | issue=2 | title=Does Extending Unemployment Benefits Improve Job Quality? | year=2017 | journal=American Economic Review | pages=527–561 | last1 = Nekoei | first1 = Arash}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Tatsiramos studied data from European countries and found that although unemployment insurance does increase unemployment duration, the duration of subsequent employment tends to be longer (suggesting better match quality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1162/JEEA.2009.7.6.1225 | volume=7 | issue=6 | title=Unemployment Insurance in Europe: Unemployment Duration and Subsequent Employment Stability | year=2009 | journal=Journal of the European Economic Association | pages=1225–1260 | last1 = Tatsiramos | first1 = Konstantinos| subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative policy====
An alternative to unemployment insurance intended to reduce the moral hazard costs would introduce mandated individual saving accounts for workers to draw on after being laid off. The plan, by [[Martin Feldstein]] would pay any positive account balance at retirement to the employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Feldstein |first1= Martin |year=2005 |title= Rethinking Social Insurance |journal=  NBER Working Papers 11250 |publisher= National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc }}   Feldstein finds that the costs, loans to individuals when funds are exhausted and the forgiveness of negative account balances at retirement, of this program to the government would be less than the current unemployment insurance program.  The benefits of the program include providing the same level of protection to the unemployed while correcting some of the [[moral hazard]] problem {{cite journal |last1= Feldstein |first1= Martin |last2= Altman |first2= Daniel |year= 1998 |title= Unemployment Insurance Savings Accounts |journal= NBER Working Paper Series |volume= 6860 |publisher= National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effect on state budgets ====
Another issue with unemployment insurance relates to its effects on state budgets. During recessionary time periods, the number of unemployed rises and they begin to draw benefits from the program. The longer the recession lasts, depending on the state's starting UI program balance, the quicker the state begins to run out of funds. The recession that began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009 has significantly impacted state budgets. According to The Council of State Governments, by 18 March 2011, 32 states plus the Virgin Islands had borrowed nearly $45.7 billion. The Labor Department estimates by the fourth quarter of 2013, as many as 40 states may need to borrow more than $90 billion to fund their unemployment programs and it will take a decade or more to pay off the debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/drupal/content/state-unemployment-insurance-trust-funds-march-2011-update Unemployment Insurance Trust Funds Update] ''Council of State Governments''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insurance funds====
Possible policy options for states to shore up the unemployment insurance funds include lowering benefits for recipients and/or raising taxes on businesses. Kentucky took the approach of raising taxes and lowering benefits to attempt to balance its unemployment insurance program. Starting in 2010, a claimant's weekly benefits will decrease from 68% to 62% and the taxable wage base will increase from $8,000 to $12,000, over a ten-year period. These moves are estimated to save the state over $450 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://migration.kentucky.gov/Newsroom/governor/20100615unempins.htm] ''Kentucky.gov''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taxing or exempting benefits====
The argument for taxation of [[social welfare]] benefits is that they result in a realized gain for a taxpayer. The argument against taxation is that the benefits are generally less than the [[federal poverty level]].

Unemployment compensation has been taxable by the federal government since 1987.&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{cite web |author=Scott, Christine |title=Taxation of Unemployment Benefits: Report for Congressional Research Service, The Library of Congress |work=Cornell University ILR School |date=14 January 2005 |format=PDF |url= http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1224&amp;context=key_workplace }}&lt;/ref&gt; Code Section 85 deemed unemployment compensation included in gross income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/85- |title=Section 85 |work=Internal Revenue Service |publisher=Cornell University Law School }}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal taxes are not withheld from unemployment compensation at the time of payment unless requested by the recipient using [[Form W-4#Filing|Form W-4V]].&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Voluntary Withholding Request |work=Internal Revenue Service |date=August 2006 |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4v.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003, Rep. [[Phil English|Philip English]] introduced legislation to repeal the taxation of unemployment compensation, but the legislation did not advance past [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|committee]].&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 798 (108th): Unemployment Tax Repeal Act of 2003 |work=United States Congress |publisher=govtrack.us |date=13 February 2003 |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h108-798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most states with income tax consider unemployment compensation to be taxable.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;
Prior to 1987, unemployment compensation amounts were excluded from federal gross income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxlinks.com/rulings/1971/revrul71-425.htm "Revenue Ruling 71-425"]. ''Internal Revenue Service''. Taxlinks.com.&lt;/ref&gt;
For the US Federal [[tax year]] of 2009, as a result of the signing of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] signed by [[Barack Obama]] on 17 February 2009 the first $2,400 worth of unemployment income received during the 'tax year' of 2009 will be exempted from being considered as taxable income on the Federal level, when American taxpayers file their 2009 IRS tax return paperwork in early 2010.

===Job sharing / short-time working===
[[Job sharing]] or work sharing and [[short time]] or short-time working refer to situations or systems in which employees agree to or are forced to accept a reduction in working time and pay. These can be based on individual agreements or on government programs in many countries that try to prevent unemployment. In these, employers have the option of reducing work hours to part-time for many employees instead of laying off some of them and retaining only full-time workers. For example, employees in 18 states of the United States can then receive unemployment payments for the hours they are no longer working.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93581221 Companies Implement Part-Time Layoffs] by Curt Nickisch. Morning Edition, National Public Radio.  21 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Payment through prepaid debit cards===
In 2013, it was reported that most U.S. states deliver unemployment benefits to [[unbanked|recipients who do not have a bank account]] through a [[prepaid debit card]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nclc.org/issues/unemployment-compensation-prepaid-cards.html 2013 Survey of Unemployment Compensation Prepaid Cards] ''©National Consumer Law Center''&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government uses the Direct Express Debit [[Mastercard]] [[prepaid debit card]] offered by Mastercard and [[Comerica Bank]] to give some federal assistance payments to people who do not have bank accounts. Many states have similar programs for unemployment payments and other assistance.

==International Labour Convention==
[[International Labour Organization]] has adopted the [[Employment Promotion and Protection against Unemployment Convention, 1988]] for promotion of [[employment]] against unemployment and [[social security]] including unemployment benefit.
