'''Aimée du Buc de Rivéry''' (4 December 1768 &amp;ndash; ?)&lt;ref&gt;Yvan Brunet du Buc de Mannetot avec la collaboration de Fabrice Renard-Marlet, "La Saga des Du Buc", Volume II, Éditions du Buc, Paris, 2013, p.454&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[France|French]] heiress who went missing at sea as a young woman. There is an unsubstantiated legend that she was captured by [[Barbary pirates]], sold as a [[harem]] [[concubine]], and was the same person as [[Nakşidil Sultan|Nakşîdil Sultan]], a [[Valide Sultan]] (Queen Mother) of the [[Ottoman Empire]]; there is no evidence of this.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061025090840/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jwh/17.2/isomverhaaren.html#FOOT1 Christine Isom-Verhaaren] ''Royal French Women in the Ottoman Sultans' Harem: The Political Uses of Fabricated Accounts from the Sixteenth to the Twenty-first Century'', ''[[Journal of World History]]'', vol. 17, No. 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Aimée was born 4 December 1768, the daughter of wealthy French plantation owner Henri du Buc de Rivery (1748 - 1808) and Marie Anne Arbousset-Beaufond (1739 - 1811) in Pointe Royale, south-west of Robert on the Caribbean island of [[Martinique]]. Through marriage, she was an eighth cousin-in-law, once removed, of [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Empress Josephine]],.&lt;ref name="Sila"&gt;Yvan Brunet du Buc de Mannetot, ''Si la Martinique m'était contée à travers l'histoire des chevaliers du Buc de la Normandie à la Martinique… en passant par la Turquie'', 2008, Ed. du Buc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Marie Martin du Theil, Silhouettes et documents du Martinique, Périgord, Lyonnais, Île-de-France, Périgueux, Imprimerie commerciale et administrative, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt; via Josephine's first marriage with [[Alexandre de Beauharnais]], who had been executed during the [[Reign of Terror]].

Having been sent to a convent school in France, she was returning home, in July or August 1788, when the ship on which she traveled vanished at sea. It is theorized that the ship was attacked and taken by [[Barbary pirates]]. It has been further suggested that she was enslaved, and eventually sent to [[Constantinople]] as a gift to the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] by the [[Bey]] of [[Algiers]].

==Legend about her being Valide Sultan Nakşidil==
[[Nota bene|N.B.]] The legend of Aimée being Valide Sultan Nakşidil of the Ottoman palace harem is not rooted in historical fact.

According to the legend, Aimée became the wife of the sultan, taking the name of Nakşidil, who introduced French ideas to the sultan, and so to the Ottoman people. It has been theorized that her French-style reforms may have led to his death at the hands of the [[Janissaries]] and the Ulema, since both groups opposed liberalization of the empire. During the rule of [[Abdul Hamid I]], She taught him French and, for the first time, a permanent ambassador was sent from Constantinople to Paris. [[Selim III]], a son of Abdul Hamid I who later succeeded him as Sultan, started a French newspaper. He also allowed Nakşidil to decorate the palace in rococo style, which was popular in France at that time.

The legend of Aimée as Nakşidil continues, claiming that she had accepted [[Islam]] as part of the harem etiquette, as well as the religion of her husband, yet always remained a [[Roman Catholic]] in her heart. Her last wish was for a priest to perform the last rites. Her son, the sultan, did not deny her this: as Aimée lay dying, a priest passed for the first time through the [[Seraglio]], to perform the Holy Sacrament before her death. Her tomb lies not far from the [[Hagia Sophia]].

==Controversy over the legend==
Researchers &lt;!--see their names below: Sakaoğlu, Vine, Isom-Verhaaren --&gt;have looked into the alleged history of Aimée du Buc de Rivéry in the royal harem and found it implausible.
{{further|Nakşidil Sultan}}

According to Turkish historian Necdet Sakaoğlu, Nakşîdil Sultan was ethnically [[Georgians|Georgian]] in origin.&lt;ref name="Nakş"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[:tr:Necdet Sakaoğlu|Sakaoğlu, Necdet]]|title=Bu mülkün kadın sultanları: Vâlide sultanlar, hâtunlar, hasekiler, kadınefendiler, sultanefendiler|url=https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=6WUMAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=havatin+hatun&amp;q=aimee|publisher=Oğlak Publications|year=2008|pages=358–360|isbn=978-9-753-29623-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While several stories state that Aimée was abducted in 1781 - untrue but early enough that the seventeen year old could have been the mother of Mahmud II, born in 1785 - other stories account for the fact that Aimée was well in France with her family until the year 1788 at least.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061025090840/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jwh/17.2/isomverhaaren.html#FOOT1 Christine Isom-Verhaaren] ''Royal French Women in the Ottoman Sultans' Harem: The Political Uses of Fabricated Accounts from the Sixteenth to the Twenty-first Century'', ''[[Journal of World History]]'', vol. 17, No. 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter recounts of the tale, Aimée is only the foster mother to Mahmud II, while his birth mother died in his childhood.

None of the fictional accounts however are considering the single contemporary (yet also unreliable) source from the year 1817: Nakşidil was reportedly abducted when she was still two years old. That version of her story makes it impossible for her to be identical with the missing Aimée.

Robert Vine wrote: "The myth of two cousins from a {{sic|?|Car|ribean}} island becoming respectively the wife of the French Emperor and the mother of the Ottoman Sultan has an obvious romantic attraction - but by the same token, is highly improbable, unless provided with solid factual proof".&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Vine, "Myth and Fact in History", P. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

There are however indications that the seeds of the legend have been carefully planted. Several older myths, dating back even to the early 16th century, already purported connections between the French and the Ottoman monarchy, but have been traced to be politically motivated fabrications, so that alliances between the respective monarchs were seen as justifiable. The Aimée-Nakşidil tale distinctly parallels to these older tales. In times of monarchy, the stories about abducted French princesses weren't repudiated to maintain good relations - in fact, both [[Napoleon III]] and [[Abdülaziz of the Ottoman Empire|Abdülaziz]] were pleased to announce their kinship to each other, years later. In later times this and similar harem tales have been used to perpetuate the prejudice of Turkey, the Middle East and the Islam in general as mysterious and despotic in nature, despite more accurate accounts available. The legend furthermore reinforced prejudices of the Ottoman Empire as a backwater country, where even a western slave consort was able to initiate an overdue modernization while the primitive natives couldn't conceive necessary reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061025090840/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jwh/17.2/isomverhaaren.html#FOOT1 Christine Isom-Verhaaren] ''Royal French Women in the Ottoman Sultans' Harem: The Political Uses of Fabricated Accounts from the Sixteenth to the Twenty-first Century'', ''[[Journal of World History]]'', vol. 17, No. 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1067">'''Amende honorable''' was originally a mode of punishment in France which required the offender, barefoot and stripped to his shirt, and led into a church or auditory with a torch in his hand and a rope round his neck held by the public executioner, to beg pardon on his knees of his God, his king, and his country; now used to denote a satisfactory apology or reparation.&lt;ref name="Nut"&gt;{{Nuttall|inline=1|title=Amende honorable}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amende honorable forbade revenge.

The ''amende honorable'' was sometimes incorporated into a larger ritual of [[capital punishment]] (specifically the [[hanging, drawing and quartering#French "quartering"|French version of drawing and quartering]]) for [[parricide]]s and [[regicide]]s; this is described in the 1975 book ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' by [[Michel Foucault]], notably in reference to [[Robert-François Damiens]] who was condemned to make the ''amende honorable'' before the main door of the Church of Paris in 1757.

In [[air traffic control]] traffic is normally separated by elevation, with east bound flights at odd thousand feet elevations and west bound flights at even thousand feet elevations (1000&amp;nbsp;ft ≈ 305m). Above 28,000&amp;nbsp;ft (~8.5&amp;nbsp;km) only odd flight levels are used, with FL 290, 330, 370, etc., for eastbound flights and FL 310, 350, 390, etc., for westbound flights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilotfriend.com/training/flight_training/nav/airways.htm airways and aircraft separation]&lt;/ref&gt; Entry to and exit from airports is always one-way traffic, as runways are chosen to allow aircraft to take off and land into the wind, to reduce ground speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/move.html Relative Velocity]&lt;/ref&gt; Even in no wind cases, a preferred calm wind runway and direction is normally chosen and used by all flights, to avoid collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/aero/avoffice/press/pdf/minnflyer606.pdf |title=Calm Wind Runways |access-date=2012-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617012601/http://www.dot.state.mn.us/aero/avoffice/press/pdf/minnflyer606.pdf |archive-date=2012-06-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In uncontrolled airports, airport information can be obtained from anyone at the airport. Traffic follows a specific traffic pattern, with designated entry and exits. Radio announcements are made, whether anyone is listening or not, to allow any other traffic to be aware of other traffic in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aopa.org/asf/publications/sa08.pdf Operations at nontowered airports]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest days of railways in the [[United Kingdom]], most lines were built [[double track]]ed because of the difficulty of coordinating operations in pre-[[telegraphy]] times.

Most modern roads carry bidirectional traffic, although [[one-way traffic]] is common in dense urban centres.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Bidirectional traffic flow is believed to influence the rate of [[traffic collision]]s. In an analysis of [[head-on collision]]s, [[rear-end collision]]s, and lane-changing collisions based on the Simon-Gutowitz bidirectional traffic model, it was concluded that "the risk of collisions is important when the density of cars in one lane is small and that of the other lane is high enough", and that "heavy vehicles cause an important reduction of traffic flow on the home lane and provoke an increase of the risk of car accident".&lt;ref name="Moussa 2009-05-26"&gt;{{Cite journal| first=Najem | last=Moussa| title=Simulation study of traffic accidents in bidirectional traffic models| year=2009 |arxiv=0905.4252| doi=10.1142/S0129183110016007| volume=21| journal=International Journal of Modern Physics C| pages=1501–1515| bibcode=2010IJMPC..21.1501M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bidirectional traffic is the most common form of flow observed in [[trails]], however, some larger pedestrian concourses exhibit multidirectional traffic.&lt;ref name="Blue TSR 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cellular automata microsimulation of bidirectional pedestrian flows|journal=Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board|year=1999|first=Victor|last=Blue|author2=Jeffrey Adler|volume=1678|issue=1|pages=135–141|doi= 10.3141/1678-17|url=http://vicblue.com/CA-BIPED.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-09-09|publisher=Transportation Research Board of the National Academies}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clara the rhinoceros''' (?1738-14 April 1758) was a female [[Indian rhinoceros]] who became famous during 17 years of [[Grand Tour|touring Europe]] in the mid-18th century. She arrived in [[Europe]] in [[Rotterdam]] in 1741, becoming the fifth living rhinoceros to be seen in Europe in modern times since [[Dürer's Rhinoceros]] in 1515. After tours through towns in the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[France]], the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], the [[Papal States]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and [[Denmark]], she died in [[Lambeth]], England.

==Life==
In 1738, aged approximately one month, Clara was adopted by [[Jan Albert Sichterman]] in India after her mother was killed by Indian hunters. Sichterman was the director of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'' or VOC) in [[Bengal]]. She became quite tame, and was allowed to move freely around his residence. In 1740, Sichterman either sold or gave her as a gift to [[Douwe Mout van der Meer]], captain of the ''Knappenhof'', who returned to the [[Netherlands]] with Clara.&lt;ref name = "Van der Pol"&gt;{{cite book|last1=van der Pol|first1=Bauke|title=THe Dutch East India Company in India|publisher=Parragon Books Ltd|isbn=978-1-4723-7605-3|page=67.68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Van der Meer would become Clara's agent and companion until her death.

Clara disembarked at Rotterdam on 22 July 1741 and was immediately exhibited to the public. Clara was exhibited in [[Antwerp]] and [[Brussels]] in 1743 and in [[Hamburg]] in 1744. The exhibitions were so successful that Douwe Mout van der Meer left the VOC in 1744 to tour Europe with his rhinoceros. He had a special wooden carriage built to convey her, and her skin was kept moist with [[fish oil]].  The tour started in earnest in spring 1746, and proved to be an outstanding success. Clara visited [[Hanover]] and [[Berlin]], where King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] saw her on 26 April in [[Spittelmarkt]]. The tour continued to [[Frankfurt an der Oder]], [[Breslau]], and [[Vienna]], where Emperor [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] and Empress [[Maria-Theresa]] saw her on 5 November.

[[Image:Clara 1747.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Example of the mass-produced souvenir pictures of Clara sold by Douwe Mout van der Meer; this example from her stay at the Gasthof "Zum Pfau" in [[Mannheim]] in November 1747.]]

In 1747, she travelled to [[Regensburg]], [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]] and [[Dresden]], where she posed for [[Johann Joachim Kaendler]] from the [[Meissen porcelain]] factory and was visited on 19 April by [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]], [[Elector of Saxony]] and [[King of Poland]]. She was in [[Leipzig]] on 23 April for Easter, and visited the [[orangery]] of the castle of [[Kassel]] at the invitation of [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse]]. In November she visited the "Gasthof zum Pfau" ''(The Peacock Inn)'' in [[Mannheim]], and she was in [[Strasbourg]] in December for Christmas.

In 1748, she visited [[Bern]], [[Zürich]], [[Basel]], [[Schaffhausen]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]] and [[Würzburg]]. She returned to [[Leiden]] and visited [[France]]. She was in [[Reims]] in December 1748, and was received by King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] in January 1749 at the royal [[menagerie]] in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. She spent 5 months in [[Paris]], creating a sensation: letters, poems, and songs were written about her, and wigs were created ''à la rhinocéros''. Clara was examined by the naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]], [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]] painted a life-size portrait of her, and she inspired the French Navy to name a vessel ''Rhinocéros'' in 1751.  A drawing based on Oudry's painting appeared in [[Diderot]] and [[D'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', and Buffon's ''Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière''.

At the end of 1749, Clara embarked at [[Marseille]]s to travel to [[Italy]]. Avoiding the fate of Dürer's Rhinoceros, which drowned in a shipwreck off the [[Liguria]]n coast near [[Porto Venere]] in 1516, Clara visited [[Naples]] and [[Rome]]. In March 1750, she visited the [[Baths of Diocletian]].  She seems to have rubbed off her horn while in Rome (a common problem for rhinoceroses kept in close confinement, although some reports claim that her horn was cut off in Rome for reasons of safety). A new horn eventually grew in.

She passed through [[Bologna]] in August and [[Milan]] in October.  She arrived in [[Venice]] in January 1751, where she became a major attraction at the [[carnival]] and was painted by [[Pietro Longhi]]. She passed through [[Verona]] on the way back to Vienna. She had reached London by the end of the year, where she was viewed by the British royal family.

Little is known of her exact movements from 1752 to 1758, but she visited [[Prague]]; then [[Warsaw]], [[Kraków]], [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] and [[Breslau]] (a second time) in 1754; and [[Copenhagen]] in 1755.  She returned to London in 1758, where she was exhibited at the ''Horse and Groom'' in [[Lambeth]], with entry prices of sixpence and one shilling. This was where she died on 14 April, aged about 20.

==Honors and recolonizations==
In 1991, the [[Natural History Museum Rotterdam|Natuurhistorisch Museum in Rotterdam]] held an exhibition on Clara. In 2008 the Clara Memorial was created at the same museum to mark the 250th death anniversary of the rhinoceros.&lt;ref name = "Van der Pol"/&gt;

The '''Columbine High School massacre''' was a [[school shooting]] that occurred on April 20, 1999, at [[Columbine High School]] in [[Columbine, Colorado|Columbine]], an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson County]] (Jeffco), [[Colorado]], [[United States]], near [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]] in the [[Denver metropolitan area]].&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/columbine-high-school-shootings|title=Columbine Shooting|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=|website=history.com|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315062132/http://www.history.com/topics/columbine-high-school-shootings|archive-date=March 15, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gina&gt;{{cite news |last=Lamb |first=Gina |date=April 17, 2008 |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/columbine_high_school/index.html |title=Columbine High School |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=February 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102075251/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/columbine_high_school/index.html |archive-date=January 2, 2016 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|The school's location is on Pierce Street, which runs north-south through Columbine, roughly one mile west of the Littleton city limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/jeffcoschools.us/chs-homepage/|title=Columbine High School|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510115758/https://sites.google.com/a/jeffcoschools.us/chs-homepage/|archive-date=May 10, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Postal Service]] designates "Littleton" as the default place name for addresses in the school's [[ZIP code]];&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/dc10map/GUBlock/st08_co/place/p0816110_columbine/DC10BLK_P0816110_001.pdf 2010 CENSUS – CENSUS BLOCK MAP: Columbine CDP, CO] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071354/http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/dc10map/GUBlock/st08_co/place/p0816110_columbine/DC10BLK_P0816110_001.pdf |date=March 4, 2016 }}" U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved on April 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; thus, the massacre was widely reported as having happened in the adjacent city of Littleton.}} The perpetrators, [[twelfth grade]] ([[senior (education)|senior]]) students [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], [[Mass murder|murdered]] 12 students and one teacher. Ten students were murdered in the library.

They injured 21 additional people with gunshots, and exchanged gunfire with the police. An additional 3 people were injured trying to escape the school. The pair subsequently committed [[suicide]] in the library. The crime has inspired several [[Copycat crime|copycats]], and "Columbine" has become a euphemism for a school shooting. At the time, it was the deadliest school shooting ever.

In addition to the shootings, the attack involved several homemade bombs. The largest of these were two placed in the cafeteria of the school, [[car bomb]]s were in the parking lot, and at another location were those intended to divert [[first responder]]s. The cafeteria and car bombs failed to detonate. The pair's motives remain unclear, but they planned for about a year and wished the massacre to rival the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] and cause the most deaths in United States history. The attack has been referred to by ''[[USA Today]]'' as a "suicidal attack [that was] planned as a grand—if badly implemented—[[Terrorism|terrorist]] bombing."&lt;ref name=ten&gt;{{cite news |last=Toppo |first=Greg |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-04-13-columbine-myths_N.htm |title=10 years later, the real story behind Columbine |work=[[USA Today]] |date=April 14, 2009 |accessdate=April 14, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415152154/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-04-13-columbine-myths_N.htm |archive-date=April 15, 2009 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a delay in entering the school, local police have been heavily criticized for not intervening during the shooting. It resulted in the introduction of the [[Immediate Action Rapid Deployment]] tactic, used in situations with an [[active shooter]] whose goal is to kill rather than take [[hostage]]s. It also resulted in an increased emphasis on school security with [[zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance]] policies, and sparked debate over [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control laws]], high school [[clique]]s, [[subculture]]s, and [[bullying]]; as well as a [[moral panic]] over [[Goth subculture|goths]], [[Global gun cultures|gun culture]], social outcasts, the use of pharmaceutical [[antidepressant]]s by teenagers, teenage Internet use and [[Video game controversies|violence in video games]].

In 1996, 15-year old Eric Harris created a private website on [[America Online]] (AOL). The site was initially to host [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] ([[Doom WAD|WAD]]s) Harris created for use in the [[first-person shooter|first-person]] [[Shoot 'em up|shooter]] video games ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Doom II]]'', as well as ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acolumbinesite.com/ericpage.html |title=Columbine shooter Eric Harris's webpages |accessdate=August 24, 2008 |publisher=Acolumbinesite.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125023328/http://acolumbinesite.com/ericpage.html |archive-date=November 25, 2010 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=salon.comt&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/04/23/gamers/index.html|title=Doom, Quake and mass murder|author=Janelle Brown|date=April 23, 1999|work=Salon|accessdate=August 24, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919092143/http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/04/23/gamers/index.html|archivedate=September 19, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Some of the ''Doom'' levels he created can still be found online, known as the [[Harris levels]].&lt;ref name=levels&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/doom.asp|title=The Harris Levels|author=Mikkelson, Barbara|date=January 1, 2005|publisher=[[Snopes.com]]|accessdate=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Once the website was made public after the massacre, AOL permanently deleted it from its servers.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

On the site, Harris began a [[blog]], which included jokes and his thoughts on parents, school, and friends. The blog also detailed Harris sneaking out of the house to cause mischief and vandalism, with his friend Dylan Klebold and others, such as lighting [[fireworks]]. Rebels are the mascot of Columbine High School (CHS), and he called these "Rebel Missions".&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;&lt;ref name=jcso97&gt;{{cite web|url=https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/jcso-1997.pdf|title=Jefferson County Sheriff's Office|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|In the case of Columbine, the Rebels refer to [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]] [[minutemen]].}} Harris and Klebold adopted the nicknames "Reb" and "[[Vodka]]" respectively.&lt;ref name=Fatal/&gt;&lt;ref name=abaj&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 1999|title=When Privacy Results In Tragedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzgaKM5QDA0C&amp;pg=PA54|journal=ABA Journal|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in early 1997, the blog postings began to show the first signs of Harris's ever-growing anger against society.&lt;ref name=jcso97 /&gt; By the end of the year, the site contained instructions on how to make explosives. Harris wrote "the first true [[pipe bomb]]s created entirely from scratch by the rebels (REB and VoDkA)...Now our only problem is to find the place that will be '[[ground zero]].'"&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fatal/&gt;

====Search warrant never filed====
Harris's site attracted few visitors, and caused no concern until March 1998. Harris ended a blog post detailing murderous fantasies with "All I want to do is kill and injure as many of you as I can, especially a few people. Like Brooks Brown;" a classmate of his.&lt;ref name="brooks4" /&gt;{{refn|group=n|Brown had told Harris's parents where he hid alcohol, after Harris had thrown a chunk of ice at his car windshield.&lt;ref name=Fatal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|2002|pages=77–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bama/&gt;}} Brown claims Klebold gave him the web address, in an effort to warn him of Harris's threats of violence against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|2002|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest it was in fact discovered by Brooks' brother Aaron Brown in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kass|2009|page=271; 287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csgv.org/point-return/|title=The Point of No Return}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Brown's parents viewed the site, they contacted the Jeffco Sheriff's Office. When investigator Michael Guerra accessed the website, he discovered numerous violent threats directed against the students and teachers of CHS.  Guerra wrote a draft [[affidavit]], requesting a [[search warrant]] of the Harris household. The affidavit also mentioned the discovery of an exploded pipe bomb in February 1998, and a suspicion of Harris being involved in the unsolved case. The affidavit was never filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/news/chronology-of-a-big-fat-lie-5066671|title=Chronology of a Big Fat Lie|date=April 19, 2001|author=Alan Prendergast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/05/columbine.diary/|title=Columbine killer envisioned crashing plane in NYC|date=December 6, 2001|accessdate=September 12, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006163130/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/05/columbine.diary/|archivedate=October 6, 2011|deadurl=yes|publisher=CNN|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Van incident ===
On January 30, 1998, Harris and Klebold broke into a van parked near Littleton and stole tools and computer equipment.&lt;ref name=juvey&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcfp.org/news/2002/1106inreha.html |title=District attorney releases Columbine gunman's juvenile records |publisher=The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press |date=November 6, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021208205724/http://www.rcfp.org/news/2002/1106inreha.html |archivedate=December 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=event1/&gt; Both were caught by a policeman shortly afterwards, [[arrest]]ed and subsequently attended a joint court hearing, where they [[Plea|pled]] guilty to the [[felony]] [[theft]]. The judge sentenced them to attend a [[Diversion program|juvenile diversion]] program.

====Diversion====
As a result, both attended mandatory classes such as [[anger management]] and talked with diversion officers.{{refn|group=n|Klebold had a history of drinking and failed a dilute urine test, but neither he nor Harris attended any substance abuse classes.&lt;ref name=Block&gt;Jerald Block. {{cite web |url= http://www.murderpedia.org/male.H/images/harris-eric/lessons-from-columbine.pdf |title= ''Lessons From Columbine: Virtual and Real Rage''}} ''American Journal of Forensic Psychiatry''. July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Harris also began attending therapy with a [[psychologist]], and was prescribed antidepressants by a [[psychiatrist]]. They both were eventually released from diversion several weeks early because of positive actions in the program and put on [[probation]].&lt;ref name=ten/&gt;&lt;ref name=juvey/&gt; Harris continued his scheduled meetings with his psychologist until a few months before the massacre.

In Harris's yearbook for 1998, nearly a year before the massacre, Klebold wrote "killing enemies, blowing up stuff, killing cops!! My wrath for January's incident will be godlike. Not to mention our revenge in the commons."&lt;ref name=yearb&gt;Klebold in Harris's yearbook, approx. May 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The commons was another term for the school cafeteria.

=== Journals ===
Harris and Klebold both kept journals, which were released to the public in 2006. In the journals, the pair would eventually document their arsenal and plan of attack.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Shortly after the court hearing for the van break-in, Harris reverted his website back to just posting user-created levels of ''Doom''. He began to write his thoughts down in a journal instead. It shows a long period of methodical preparation for the massacre. Harris even wrote on his computer about escaping to a foreign country after the attack, or [[aircraft hijacking|hijacking an aircraft]] at [[Denver International Airport]] and crashing it into [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Klebold had already been writing down his thoughts since March 1997. As early as November 1997, Klebold mentioned going on a killing spree.&lt;ref name=kj11397&gt;Klebold journal, Thoughts, November 3, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schoolwork ===
Harris and Klebold also incorporated their schoolwork into their pre-massacre activities. They both displayed themes of violence in their [[creative writing]] projects. Harris wished for "a lot of [[foreshadowing]] and [[Irony|dramatic irony]]" to be involved in the massacre plot.&lt;ref name=tape2651/&gt;&lt;ref name=HJ4399&gt;Harris journal, April 3, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Harris wrote a paper on school shootings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.columbine-guide.com/columbine-harris-school-shooters|title=Eric Harris Essay on School Shooters|website=The Columbine Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a poem from the perspective of a bullet.&lt;ref name=tape2651/&gt; Klebold wrote a short story about a man killing students which worried his teacher so much that she alerted his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/klebold_short_story.pdf|title=A Short Story by Dylan Klebold}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|On the day of the massacre, Klebold had the story in his car's [[glove compartment]].}} 

Both had actively researched war and murder. For one project, Harris wrote a paper on the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and Klebold wrote a paper on [[Charles Manson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.columbine-guide.com/columbine-eric-harris-nazi-essay|title=Eric Harris Nazis essay|website=The Columbine Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acolumbinesite.com/dylan/manson.php|title=Dylan Klebold's Creative Writing – Charles Manson Report|last=Shepard|first=C|website=www.acolumbinesite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[psychology]] class, Harris wrote he dreamed of going on a shooting spree with Klebold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/04/25/to-killers-model-school-was-cruel/46cf1fd6-74e2-478e-a387-f967cd7594e6/|title=To Killers, Model School Was Cruel|date=April 25, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Echoing a science class, Harris's journals included several experimental bomb detonations.&lt;ref name="Block" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cullen|2009|pages=33–34,183–185,275–277,371–380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tapes ===
Both Harris and Klebold were enrolled in video production classes.&lt;ref name="dive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolshooters.info/eric-harris-diversion.pdf|title=Eric Harris diversion files|publisher=Office of the District Attorney, First Judicial District, Jefferson and Gilpin Counties|page=49|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014005724/http://www.schoolshooters.info/eric-harris-diversion.pdf|archivedate=October 14, 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=October 15, 2014|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one video called [[Radioactive decay|Radioactive]] Clothing, they are depicted with fake guns and rigging fake explosives to "take out another one of those radioactive clothes infested camps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0420d.htm|title=Descriptions vary of suspects|author=Jim Hughes|date=April 21, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBKl-UZF1XE|title=Klebold and Harris - Radioactive Clothing (best quality)|first=|last=ItsJustMe7771|date=February 21, 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Hitmen for Hire''=====
When an economics class had Harris make an ad for a business, he and Klebold made a video called "[[Contract killing|Hitmen]] for Hire" on December 8, 1998, which was released in February 2004. It depicts them as part of the [[Trench coat|Trench Coat]] [[Mafia]], a clique in the school who wore black trench coats,&lt;ref name=coat/&gt; extorting money for protecting [[Preppy|preps]] from bullies.&lt;ref name=Fatal/&gt;&lt;ref name=hithire/&gt; They were apparently not a part of the Trench Coat Mafia, but were friends with some of its members.&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/09/23/columbine_4/|title=Inside the Columbine High investigation|last=Cullen|first=Dave|date=September 23, 1999|accessdate=October 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517044320/http://www.salon.com/1999/09/23/columbine_4/|archive-date=May 17, 2017|dead-url=no|publisher=[[Salon.com|Salon]]|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;{{refn|group=n|They did not appear in a group photo of the Trench Coat Mafia in the yearbook.&lt;ref&gt;Wilgoren, Jodi (April 25, 1999).

=====Rampart Range=====
On October 21, 2003, a video was released showing the pair doing [[target practice]] on March 6, 1999, in nearby foothills known as Rampart Range, with the weapons they would use in the massacre.&lt;ref name=evid&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.columbine-guide.com/columbine-all-evidence|title=Columbine Evidence Released}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also shooting with them is Mark Manes and Phil Duran, older men who helped supply one of the guns, and Manes's girlfriend.&lt;ref name=Fatal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acolumbinesite.com/rampart.html|title=Rampart Range video quotes and screenshots|first=C|last=Shepard|website=www.acolumbinesite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Basement Tapes =====
Harris and Klebold also kept five video tapes shot with school video equipment that documented their weapons, as well as their plans and reasons for the massacre, including the ways they hid their arsenals and deceived their parents.&lt;ref name=slatecol /&gt; Most of these were shot in the Harris family basement, and are known as the Basement Tapes. Approximately thirty minutes before the attack, they made a final video saying goodbye and apologizing to their friends and families.&lt;ref name=tape333&gt;Basement Tapes, "Top Secret Rampart", April 20, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1999, before anybody else had seen them, [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] published an article on these tapes.&lt;ref name=tape&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207005715/http://www.state.co.us:80/columbine/Appendix_E.pdf|title=The Columbine Tapes|first1=Nancy|last1=Gibbs|first2=Timothy|last2=Roche|date=December 12, 1999|publisher=|via=content.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim's family members threatened to sue Jeffco. As a result, select victim families and journalists were allowed to see them, and they were then kept from the public indefinitely for fear of inspiring future massacres. The tapes have since been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/news/lisa-calderon-wants-to-unseat-michael-hancock-to-become-first-female-mayor-of-denver-10894908|title=Columbine Killers' Basement Tapes Destroyed|author=Alan Prendergast|date=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are only transcripts of some of the dialogue, and a short clip recorded surreptitiously by a victim's father. The pair claimed they were going to make copies of the tapes to send to news stations, but apparently never got around to it.&lt;ref name=tape2652/&gt;

===== Nixon tape =====
Harris once did a school project involving a micro cassette tape audio recording of a fellow named Nixon about his life in [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;JC-001-26659&lt;/ref&gt; In the early morning hours before the massacre, Harris taped over this recording, leaving a message for his family, and left it on the kitchen table. This too has never been made public. It is known as the Nixon tape. On it Harris said "It is less than nine hours now." He went on to say "People will die because of me" and "It will be a day that will be remembered forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cullen|2009|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaponry==

=== Guns ===
In the months prior to the attacks, Harris and Klebold acquired two [[9&amp;nbsp;mm]] firearms and two [[Gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] shotguns. Harris had a [[Hi-Point Carbine|Hi-Point 995 Carbine]] with thirteen 10-round magazines and a Savage-Springfield 67H [[pump-action]] [[shotgun]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vpc.org/studies/wgun990420.htm|title=VPC – Where'd They Get Their Guns? – Columbine High School, Littleton, Colorado|website=www.vpc.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161217001607/http://www.vpc.org/studies/wgun990420.htm|archive-date=December 17, 2016|dead-url=no|accessdate=February 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Columbine Report, {{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/EQUIPMENT_TEXT.htm|title=How they were equipped that day|last=|first=|date=May 15, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202153237/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/EQUIPMENT_TEXT.htm|archive-date=December 2, 2009|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-06-26|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klebold used a [[9×19mm]] [[Intratec]] [[TEC-9]] [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] handgun with one 52-, one 32-, and one 28-round magazine and a [[Savage Arms|Stevens]] 311D [[double-barreled shotgun]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Harris's shotgun was [[sawed-off shotgun|sawed-off]] to around {{convert|26|in|m}} and Klebold shortened his shotgun's length to approximately {{convert|23|in|m}}, a felony under the [[National Firearms Act]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Tanner Gun Show ====
[[File:Hp995carbine22.jpg|thumb|9 mm Hi-Point 995 carbine, one of the guns used by Harris]]
On November 22, 1998, their friend Robyn Anderson had purchased the carbine rifle and the two shotguns for the pair at the Tanner Gun Show, as they were too young to legally purchase the guns themselves.&lt;ref name=Fatal/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Anderson made her purchase from a private seller, not a licensed dealer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After the attack, she told investigators that she had believed the pair wanted the items for target shooting, and that she had no prior knowledge of their plans.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |author=Dan Luzadder |date=October 3, 1999 |url=http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/shooting/1003robyn.shtml |title=Loophole protects Columbine 'witness' |newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221030107/http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/shooting/1003robyn.shtml |archivedate=February 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Harvnb|Klebold|2016|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson was not charged.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9908/18/columbine.manes/index.html|title=CNN – Gun provider pleads guilty in Columbine case – August 18, 1999|website=www.cnn.com|access-date=2018-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125215205/http://www.cnn.com/US/9908/18/columbine.manes/index.html|archive-date=November 25, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|The Jeffco Final Report explained that "No law, state or federal, prohibits the purchase of a [[long gun]] ([[rifle]]) from a private individual (non-licensed dealer)...If Anderson had purchased the guns from a federally licensed dealer, it would have been considered a "[[straw purchase]]" and considered illegal under federal law to make the purchase for Harris and Klebold."&lt;ref name=coat&gt;Columbine Report, {{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/MAFIA_TEXT.htm|title=The Trench Coat Mafia &amp; Associates|last=|first=|date=May 15, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204180405/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/MAFIA_TEXT.htm|archive-date=December 4, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-06-26|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Three days before the shooting, Klebold attended the high school [[prom]] with Anderson.&lt;ref name=Fatal/&gt;

[[File:kg99.jpg|thumb|9 mm TEC-9 pistol, one of the guns used by Klebold]]
Both Harris and Klebold held part-time jobs at a local [[Blackjack Pizza]].

=== Explosives ===
In addition to the shootings, the complex and highly planned attack involved several [[improvised explosive devices]]. Using instructions obtained via the Internet and the [[The Anarchist Cookbook|''Anarchist Cookbook'']], they constructed a total of 99 bombs.&lt;ref name="bombsum"&gt;Columbine Report, {{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/BOMBS_TEXT.htm|title=Bomb Summary|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218120916/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/BOMBS_TEXT.htm|archive-date=February 18, 2016|dead-url=no|accessdate=April 15, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris also attempted to make [[napalm]], and envisioned a kind of backpack and [[flamethrower]]. They both attempted to get another friend and coworker Chris Morris, who was a part of the Trench Coat Mafia, to keep the napalm at his house, but he refused. Harris also tried to recruit him to be a third shooter, but would play it off as a joke when rebuked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cullen|2009|pages=330–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spring 1998, Harris's father caught him with a pipe bomb, and went out with him to the mountains to detonate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lynn Bartels|title=Parents Found bomb In Room Harris' Pal Tells FBI, Paper That Dad Detonated Explosive With His Son, Didn't Report It|work=Rocky Mountain News|date=May 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klebold scared his coworkers by once bringing a pipe bomb into work.&lt;ref name=Fatal /&gt; After the massacre, six pipe bombs had been left in Klebold's bedroom, and two in Harris's.&lt;ref name=bombsum /&gt; They would give names to their pipe bombs. One left in Klebold's room was called "[[Atlanta]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acolumbinesite.com/evidence/ev3.jpg|title=Index of Evidence Released|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably after the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|Olympic Park bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kass|2009|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Propane bombs====
The weekend before the shootings, Harris and Klebold had purchased propane tanks and other supplies from a hardware store for a few hundred dollars. They purchased six propane tanks on the morning of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cullen|2009|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris was caught on a [[Texaco]] gas station security camera at 9:12&amp;nbsp;a.m. purchasing a [[Blue Rhino]] propane tank. Each cafeteria bomb was made from one {{convert|20|lb|kg}} tank with a gallon gas can attached.&lt;ref name=guidebomb /&gt;

====Car bombs====
Each car bomb was made from pipe bombs and two 20 pound propane tanks. Cans and bottles filled with gasoline were also set throughout the cars; they did not bother to rig everything together.&lt;ref name=guidebomb&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.columbine-guide.com/columbine-bombs|title=The Bombs: The Columbine Guide|website=The Columbine Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Knives ===
Though they never used them, they also each carried two knives during the massacre. One of Harris's was in a sheath taped to his ankle. One of Klebold's was a show piece; it had a curved blade and several spikes on the handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acolumbinesite.com/evidence.php|title=Columbine High School shooting evidence exhibit|first=C|last=Shepard|website=www.acolumbinesite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==April 20, 1999: The massacre==
According to their journals and videos, the pair hoped that after detonating their home-made explosives in the cafeteria at the busiest lunch hour, killing hundreds of students, they would shoot and stab and toss bombs at survivors fleeing from the school. Then, as police vehicles, ambulances, fire trucks, and reporters came to the school, bombs set in the boys' cars would detonate, killing these emergency and other personnel.&lt;ref name=ten /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/329303.stm|title=Columbine killers planned to kill 500|date=April 27, 1999|accessdate=October 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515095812/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/329303.stm|archive-date=May 15, 2010|dead-url=no|publisher=[[BBC News]]|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This did not happen, since the bombs in the cafeteria and cars failed to detonate.

Several official sources claim they planned to shoot the fleeing survivors from the parking lot, but moved to the staircase on a hill at the west side of the school when the bombs failed.&lt;ref name=hist /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e. g. {{cite web|url=https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/Columbine%20-%20Governor's%20Commission%20Report.pdf|title=Governor's Report|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts suggest the top of the staircase where the massacre began was in fact their preferred spot to wait for the bombs to go off.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Krabbé|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Klebold made notes just before the massacre which include "Go to outside hill, wait.

=== Planting the bombs ===
On Tuesday morning, April 20, 1999, Harris and Klebold placed two duffel bags each containing propane bombs in the cafeteria, set to explode at approximately 11:17&amp;nbsp;a.m, during the "A" lunch shift.{{refn|group=n|All times are in [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain Daylight Time]], [[UTC-6]]}} Propane bombs were also placed in the cafeteria's  kitchen.&lt;ref name=after/&gt;

No witness recalled seeing the duffel bags being added to the 400 or so backpacks already in the cafeteria.&lt;ref name=timeline1&gt;Columbine Report, {{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/NARRATIVE.Time.Line.htm|title=The Columbine High School Shootings: Narrative Time Line of Events 11:10 a.m. to 11:59 a.m.|date=May 15, 2000|accessdate=December 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215192448/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/NARRATIVE.Time.Line.htm|archive-date=December 15, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The security staff at Columbine did not observe the bags being placed in the cafeteria, ostensibly because a custodian was replacing the school security video tape as it happened around 11:14&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name=duffle&gt;Columbine Report, [http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/dufflebags.htm The bombs are placed in the cafeteria]&lt;/ref&gt; The bags holding the bombs were supposedly first visible on the fresh security tape, but were not identified as suspicious items.

A Jeffco Sheriff's Deputy, Neil Gardner, was assigned to the high school as a full-time uniformed and armed [[school resource officer]]. Gardner usually ate lunch with students in the cafeteria, but on April 20 he was eating lunch in his patrol car at the northwest corner of the campus, watching students in the Smokers' Pit in Clement Park, a meadow adjacent to the school.&lt;ref name=deputies&gt;Columbine Report, {{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/DEPUTIES_TEXT.htm|title=Deputies on Scene|accessdate=December 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222141354/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/DEPUTIES_TEXT.htm|archive-date=December 22, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two backpacks filled with pipe bombs, aerosol canisters, and small propane bombs were also placed in a field about {{convert|3|mi}} south of CHS, and {{cvt|2|mi}} south of the fire station.{{refn|group=n|On the corner of South Wadsworth Boulevard and Ken Caryl Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;Columbine Report, {{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/Diversion_MAP.htm |title=Location of the Diversion Explosive Device: Summary |date=May 15, 2000 |accessdate=December 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112034658/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/Diversion_MAP.htm |archive-date=November 12, 2012 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Set to explode at approximately 11:14&amp;nbsp;a.m., the bombs were intended as a diversion to draw firefighters and emergency personnel away from the school. Only the pipe bombs and one of the aerosol canisters detonated, causing a small fire, which was quickly extinguished by the fire department. Bomb technicians immediately examined the bombs, and relayed to police at the school the possibility of devices with motion activators.&lt;ref name=bombsum /&gt;

At 11:10&amp;nbsp;a.m., Harris and Klebold arrived separately at CHS. Harris parked his vehicle in the junior student parking lot, and Klebold parked in the adjoining senior student parking lot.  The school cafeteria, their primary bomb target, with its long outside window-wall and ground-level doors, was just north of the senior parking lot.&lt;ref&gt;Columbine Report, Diagram 12&lt;/ref&gt; Above the cafeteria, the second-story of the window-wall, was the library. Each car contained car bombs timed to detonate at 12&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="guidebomb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klebold|2016|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Harris pulled into the parking lot, he encountered Brooks Brown, with whom he had recently patched up their longstanding series of disputes. According to Brown, who was in the parking lot smoking a cigarette, he was surprised to see Harris, whom he had earlier noted had been absent from an important class test. Harris seemed unconcerned, commenting, "It doesn't matter anymore." Harris went on: "Brooks, I like you now. Get out of here. Go home." Brown, feeling uneasy, and already prepared to skip his next class, walked away.&lt;ref name=brooks4&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|2002|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bama&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bestofama.com/amas/gulaf|title=IAmA Columbine survivor named Brooks Brown. I was friends - BestofAMA|website=bestofama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several minutes later, students departing Columbine for their lunch break observed Brown heading down South Pierce Street away from the school.

Meanwhile, Harris and Klebold armed themselves, hiding weapons beneath black trench coats with straps and webbing, and carrying backpacks and duffel bags filled with pipe bombs and ammunition. Harris also had his shotgun in one of the bags. Beneath the trench coats, Harris wore a white T-shirt which read "[[Natural selection|Natural Selection]]" in black letters, as well as a homemade [[bandolier]]; Klebold wore a black T-shirt which read "Wrath" in red letters.

They climbed to the top of the outdoor steps which led up a hill placing them on a level with the school's west entrance, first Harris and then Klebold. Harris put a black fingerless glove on his right hand, and Klebold was already wearing the matching fingerless glove on his left.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=demon /&gt; From this vantage point, one of the cafeteria's ground-level doors was located at the bottom of the staircase.

The cafeteria bombs failed to explode. Had these bombs exploded with full power, they could have killed or severely wounded all of the approximately 488 students in the cafeteria, and possibly made the ceiling collapse by destroying the pillars holding it up, dropping the library into the cafeteria.&lt;ref name="bombsum" /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

At 11:19&amp;nbsp;a.m., 17-year-old [[Rachel Scott]] was having lunch with friend Richard Castaldo while sitting on the grass next to the west entrance of the school. Klebold threw a pipe bomb towards the parking lot, which only partially detonated. Thinking the pipe bomb was no more than a crude [[senior prank]], Castaldo did not take it seriously. Several students inside the school during the attack also believed they were watching a senior prank at first.&lt;ref name=eyes/&gt;&lt;ref name=librev/&gt;

Harris and Klebold faced each other and nodded. Harris then yelled, "Go! Go!" They pulled their guns from beneath their trench coats and began shooting at Castaldo and Scott.&lt;ref name=timeline1 /&gt; Scott was killed when she was hit four times with rounds fired from Harris's carbine; one shot was to the [[Temple (anatomy)|left temple]].&lt;ref name=OOL&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007023504/http://www.acolumbinesite.com/reports/cr/p11867-11870.pdf|page=JC-001-011868|chapter=Columbine High - OOL Deceased|title=Columbine High School 99-7625 Evidence|volume=2|access-date=October 6, 2018|publisher=Jefferson County Sheriff's Office|location=Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castaldo was shot eight times in the chest, arm, and abdomen and paralyzed below the chest, falling into unconsciousness.

Harris aimed his carbine down the west staircase toward three youths: 15-year-olds Daniel Rohrbough and Sean Graves and 16-year-old Lance Kirklin. The three friends had been ascending the staircase directly below the shooters. All three were shot and wounded.&lt;ref name=timeline1 /&gt; In the cafeteria, Dave Sanders, a teacher and coach at the school, became aware of the gunfire and began warning students.&lt;ref name=dave&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acolumbinesite.com/victim/sanders.php|title=William "Dave" Sanders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shooters turned and began firing west in the direction of five students sitting on the grassy hillside adjacent to the steps and opposite the west entrance of the school.&lt;ref name=timeline1 /&gt; 15-year-old Michael Johnson was hit in the face, leg, and arm, but ran and escaped; 16-year-old Mark Taylor was shot in the chest, arms, and leg and fell to the ground, where he feigned death. The other three escaped uninjured.&lt;ref name=timeline1 /&gt;

Klebold walked down the steps toward the cafeteria. He came up to Lance Kirklin, who was already wounded and lying on the ground, weakly calling for help. Klebold said, "Sure. I'll help you," then shot Kirklin in the face with his shotgun, critically wounding him.&lt;ref name=eyes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0613a.htm|title=Through the Eyes of Survivors|accessdate=March 16, 2017|newspaper=The Denver Post Online|date=June 13, 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114133750/http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0613a.htm|archive-date=November 14, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/col0416a.htm|title=Lance Kirklin's story|date=April 16, 2000|author=Kevin Simpson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Rohrbough and Sean Graves had descended the staircase when the shooters' attention was diverted by the students on the grass; Graves—paralyzed beneath the waist—had crawled into the doorway of the cafeteria's west entrance and collapsed.

Klebold only slightly entered the cafeteria, and did not shoot at the several people still inside. Officials speculated that Klebold went to check on the propane bombs. Harris was still on top of the stairs shooting, and severely wounded and partially paralyzed 17-year-old Anne-Marie Hochhalter as she tried to flee.&lt;ref name=surfive/&gt;&lt;ref name=five/&gt; Klebold came out of the cafeteria and went back up the stairs to join Harris.&lt;ref name=timeline1 /&gt; They shot at students standing close to a soccer field but did not hit anyone. They walked toward the west entrance, throwing pipe bombs in several directions including onto the roof, very few of which detonated. Witnesses heard one of them say "This is what we always wanted to do. This is awesome!"&lt;ref name=event1/&gt;

Meanwhile, inside the school, Patti Nielson, an art teacher, had noticed the commotion and walked toward the west entrance with a 17-year-old student, Brian Anderson. She had intended to walk outside to tell the two students to "Knock it off,"&lt;ref name=timeline1 /&gt; thinking they were either filming a video or pulling a student prank.&lt;ref name=eyes/&gt; As Anderson opened the first set of double doors, they shot out the windows, injuring him with flying glass and hitting Nielson in the shoulder with shrapnel. Anderson and Nielson ran back down the hall into the library, and Nielson alerted the students inside to the danger, telling them to get under desks and keep silent. She dialed 9-1-1 and hid under the library's administrative counter.&lt;ref name=timeline1 /&gt; Anderson fell to the floor bleeding from his injuries, and hid inside an open staff break room. 

===11:22 a.m.: Police response===
Harris removed his trench coat. At 11:22&amp;nbsp;a.m., the custodian called Deputy Neil Gardner, the assigned resource officer to Columbine, on the school radio, requesting assistance in the senior parking lot. The only paved route took him around the school to the east and south on Pierce Street, where at 11:23&amp;nbsp;a.m. he heard on his police radio that a female was down, and assumed she had been struck by a car. While exiting his patrol car in the Senior lot at 11:24&amp;nbsp;a.m., he heard another call on the school radio, "Neil, there's a shooter in the school".&lt;ref name=deputies /&gt;

Harris, at the west entrance, immediately turned and fired ten shots from his carbine at Gardner, who was sixty yards away.&lt;ref name=deputies /&gt; As Harris reloaded his carbine, Gardner leaned over the top of his car and fired four rounds at Harris from his service pistol.&lt;ref name=eyes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kass|2009|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris ducked back behind the building, and Gardner momentarily believed that he had hit him. Harris then reemerged and fired at least four more rounds at Gardner (which missed and struck two parked cars), before retreating into the building.&lt;ref name=deputies /&gt; No one was hit during the exchange of gunfire.&lt;ref name=deputies /&gt;{{refn|group=n|Gardner was not wearing his prescription eyeglasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Trent Seibert |date=November 23, 2000 |title=Columbine: Deputy's eyesight in question |url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/col1123b.htm |work=[[The Denver Post]] |accessdate=October 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322205016/http://extras.denverpost.com/news/col1123b.htm |archive-date=March 22, 2015 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Gardner reported on his police radio, "Shots in the building. I need someone in the south lot with me."&lt;ref name=deputies /&gt;
By this point, Harris had shot 47 times, and Klebold just 5. The shooters then entered the school through the west entrance, moving along the main North Hallway, throwing pipe bombs and shooting at anyone they encountered. Klebold shot Stephanie Munson in the ankle; she was able to walk out of the school.&lt;ref name=eyes/&gt; The pair then shot out the windows to the East Entrance of the school. After proceeding through the hall several times and shooting toward—and missing—any students they saw, they went toward the west entrance and turned into the Library Hallway.

Deputy Paul Smoker, a motorcycle patrolman for the Jeffco Sheriff's Office, was writing a traffic ticket north of the school when the "female down" call came in at 11:23&amp;nbsp;a.m., most likely referring to the already dead Rachel Scott. Taking the shortest route, he drove his motorcycle over grass between the athletic fields and headed toward the west entrance. When he saw Deputy Scott Taborsky following him in a patrol car, he abandoned his motorcycle for the safety of the car. The two deputies had begun to rescue two wounded students near the ball fields when another gunfight broke out at 11:26&amp;nbsp;a.m., as Harris returned to the double doors and again began shooting at Deputy Gardner, who returned fire. From the hilltop, Deputy Smoker fired three rounds from his pistol at Harris, who again retreated into the building. As before, no one was hit.&lt;ref name=deputies /&gt;&lt;ref name=timeline1 /&gt;

Inside the school cafeteria, teacher Dave Sanders and two custodians, Jon Curtis and Jay Gallatine, initially told students to get under the tables, then successfully evacuated students up the staircase leading to the second floor of the school. The stairs were located around the corner from the Library Hallway in the main South Hallway. Sanders then tried to secure as much of the school as he could.&lt;ref name=eyes/&gt;&lt;ref name=dave /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fountaincounty.org/Heroes%20and%20Celebrities.html | title=David Sanders Fountain Central Class of 1969: The Columbine hero | publisher=Fountain county heroes | accessdate=July 23, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826024538/http://fountaincounty.org/Heroes%20and%20Celebrities.html | archivedate=August 26, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By now, Harris and Klebold were inside the main hallway. Sanders and another student were down at the end of the hallway, where he gestured for students in the library to stay. They encountered Harris and Klebold, who were approaching from the corner of the North Hallway. Sanders and the student turned and ran in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite news |author=Lou Kilzer |author2=Gary Massaro |url=http://www.denver-rmn.com/shooting/0516dave3.shtml |title= Science teacher died a hero |newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234555/http://www.denver-rmn.com/shooting/0516dave3.shtml |archivedate=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris and Klebold shot at them both, with Harris hitting Sanders twice in the back and neck but missing the student.&lt;ref name=eyes/&gt;&lt;ref name=dave /&gt; The latter ran into a science classroom and warned everyone to hide. Klebold walked over towards Sanders, who had collapsed, to look for the student but returned to Harris up the North Hallway.

Sanders struggled toward the science area, and a teacher took him into a classroom where 30&amp;nbsp;students were located. Due to his knowledge of first aid, student Aaron Hancey was brought to the classroom from another by teachers despite the unfolding commotion.&lt;ref name=hancey&gt;{{cite web|last=Trostle|first=Pat|url=http://news.hjnews.com/columbine-hero-has-local-ties/article_b823be2b-4681-53c7-b595-0d7b1380190d.html|title=Columbine hero has local ties|date=February 2, 2000|accessdate=April 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310234158/http://news.hjnews.com/columbine-hero-has-local-ties/article_b823be2b-4681-53c7-b595-0d7b1380190d.html|archive-date=March 10, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the assistance of a fellow student named Kevin Starkey, and teacher Teresa Miller, Hancey administered first aid to Sanders for three hours, attempting to stem the blood loss using shirts from students in the room, and showing him pictures from his wallet to keep him talking.&lt;ref name=eyes/&gt;&lt;ref name=hancey /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klebold|2016|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a phone in the room, Miller and several students maintained contact with police outside the school.

===11:29 a.m. – 11:36 a.m.: Library massacre===
As the shooting unfolded, Patti Nielson talked on the phone with emergency services, telling her story and urging students to take cover beneath desks.&lt;ref name=eyes/&gt; According to transcripts, her call was received by a 9-1-1 operator at 11:25:05&amp;nbsp;a.m. Before entering, the shooters threw two bombs into the cafeteria, both of which exploded. They then threw another bomb into the library hallway; it exploded and damaged several lockers. At 11:29&amp;nbsp;a.m., they entered the library, where a total of 52 students, two teachers and two librarians had concealed themselves. Harris yelled, "Get up!" so loudly that he can be heard on Patti Nielson's 9-1-1 recording at 11:29:18&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=http://i.cnn.net/cnn/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/videos/PATTI.mpg |title=PATTI |publisher=Jefferson County 911 |accessdate=October 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514003812/http://i.cnn.net/cnn/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/videos/PATTI.mpg |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Klebold then shouted "Everybody get up, now!"

Harris fired his shotgun twice at a desk. A student named Evan Todd had been standing near a pillar when the shooters entered the library, and had just begun hiding behind a copier.&lt;ref name="librev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lark6" /&gt; Todd was hit by wood splinters in the eye and lower back but was not seriously injured.&lt;ref name="inju"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://acolumbinesite.com/victim/injured6.php#evan|title=Injured Victims|last=Shepard|first=C|website=acolumbinesite.com|access-date=2018-05-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523100301/http://acolumbinesite.com/victim/injured6.php#evan|archive-date=May 23, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd then hid behind the administrative counter.

The shooters walked into the library, toward rows of computers. A disabled student, Kyle Velasquez, 16, was sitting at the north row; police later said he had not hidden underneath the desk when the shooters had first entered the library, but had curled up under the computer table. Klebold shot and killed Velasquez with his shotgun, hitting him in the head and back.&lt;ref name=librev/&gt;&lt;ref name=OOL/&gt;

"This is our revenge!", Harris and Klebold shouted. "For the four fucked-up years you put us through. For four years of bullying and giving us shit. Hey, jocks, this is our revenge for making us outcasts. We're gonna blow this library up!"&lt;ref name=eyes/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The shooters put down their ammunition-filled duffel bags at the south—or lower—row of computers and reloaded their weapons. They walked toward the windows facing the outside staircase. Noticing police evacuating students outside the school, Harris said: "Let's go kill some cops." They shot out the windows in the direction of the police. Officers returned fire, and the gunmen retreated from the windows; no one was injured.&lt;ref name=timeline1 /&gt;

After firing out the windows, Klebold removed his trench coat. Staff and students hiding said they heard Klebold say things like: "Everyone with a white cap, stand up!"  "All [[Jock (athlete)|jocks]] stand up! We'll get the guys in white hats!"  and "Anybody with a white hat on is dead".&lt;ref name="librev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lark6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kacey Ruegsegger's statement, JC-001-000125-126&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing a white baseball cap at Columbine was a tradition among sports team members. Several students tried to hide their white hats. 

When no one stood up in response, Klebold said, "Fine, I'll start shooting anyway!" Klebold fired his shotgun at a nearby table, injuring three students: Patrick Ireland, Daniel Steepleton, and Makai Hall.&lt;ref name="librev" /&gt; Harris walked toward the lower row of computer desks with his shotgun, firing a single shot under the first desk from a short distance away, while down on one knee.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; He hit 14-year-old Steven Curnow with a mortal wound to the neck.&lt;ref name="OOL" /&gt; 

Harris then walked closer, got on one knee, and shot under the adjacent computer desk, injuring 17-year-old Kacey Ruegsegger with a shot which passed completely through her right shoulder and hand, also grazing her neck and severing a major artery.&lt;ref name="OOL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="remem"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/remembering-columbine/ar-AA2QskL|title=Remembering Columbine|work=MSN|date=July 17, 2014|accessdate=August 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826014926/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/remembering-columbine/ar-AA2QskL|archive-date=August 26, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she started gasping in pain, Harris tersely stated, "Quit your bitching."&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://people.com/archive/columbine-five-years-later-vol-61-no-15/ |title=Columbine Five Years Later |publisher=people.com |date=2004-04-19 |accessdate=2016-11-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117211130/https://people.com/archive/columbine-five-years-later-vol-61-no-15/ |archive-date=November 17, 2016 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris walked over to the table across from the lower computer row, slapped the surface twice and knelt, saying "[[Peekaboo|Peek-a-boo]]" to 17-year-old [[Cassie Bernall]] before shooting her once in the head, killing her instantly.&lt;ref name=OOL/&gt;&lt;ref name=autopsy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autopsyfiles.org/columbine.htm/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811124613/http://www.autopsyfiles.org/columbine.htm/ |archive-date=August 11, 2015|title=Columbine Massacre Victims}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris had been holding the shotgun with one hand at this point and the weapon hit his face in [[recoil]], breaking his nose. Prior to her murder, Bernall had been praying, with her hands on the sides of her head.&lt;ref name=yes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/1999/09/30/bernall/|author=Dave Cullen|title=Who said "Yes"?|date=September 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After fatally shooting Bernall, Harris turned toward the next table, where Bree Pasquale sat next to the table rather than under it. Harris's nose was [[Epistaxis|bleeding heavily]]; witnesses later reported that he seemed disoriented and had blood around his mouth. Harris asked Pasquale if she wanted to die, and she responded with a plea for her life. Harris laughed and responded "Everyone's gonna die." When Klebold said "shoot her", Harris responded "No, we're gonna blow up the school anyway."&lt;ref name=lark6&gt;{{Harvnb|Larkin|2007|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klebold noticed Ireland trying to provide aid to Hall, who had suffered a wound to his knee. As Ireland tried to help Hall, his head rose above the table; Klebold shot him a second time, hitting him twice in the head and once in the foot. Ireland was knocked unconscious, but survived.&lt;ref name=eyes/&gt;

Klebold walked toward another set of tables, where he discovered 18-year-old Isaiah Shoels, 16-year-old Matthew Kechter and 16-year-old Craig Scott (Rachel's younger brother), hiding under one table. Klebold tried to pull Shoels out from under the table. He called to Harris, "Reb! There's a [[nigger]] over here!"&lt;ref name=eyes/&gt;&lt;ref name=suit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19991006&amp;id=L2RWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NPIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6615,4899761|title=Massacre Memorial Sparks Suit|work=The Spokesman Review|date=October 6, 1999|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris left Pasquale and joined him. According to witnesses, they taunted Shoels for a few seconds, making derogatory racial comments. Harris knelt down and shot Shoels once in the chest at close range, killing him instantly. Klebold also knelt down and opened fire, hitting and killing Kechter. Harris then yelled; "Who's ready to die next?"&lt;ref name=eyes/&gt; Meanwhile, Scott was uninjured; he lay in the blood of his friends, feigning death. Harris turned and threw a cricket at the table where Hall, Steepleton, and Ireland were located. It landed on Steepleton's thigh, Hall quickly threw it away, and it exploded behind them in mid-air.&lt;ref name=eyes/&gt;&lt;ref name=remem/&gt;

Harris walked toward the bookcases between the west and center section of tables in the library. He jumped on one and shook it, apparently attempting to topple it, then shot at the books which had fallen. Klebold walked through the main area, past the first set of bookcases, the central desk area and a second set of bookcases into the east area. Harris walked from the bookcase he had shot from, past the central area to meet Klebold. The latter shot at a display case located next to the door, then turned and shot toward the closest table, hitting and injuring 17-year-old Mark Kintgen in the head and shoulder. He then turned toward the table to his left and fired, injuring 18-year-olds Lisa Kreutz and Valeen Schnurr with the same shotgun blast. Klebold then moved toward the same table and fired with the TEC-9, killing 18-year-old Lauren Townsend.&lt;ref name=remem/&gt; At this point, the seriously injured Valeen Schnurr began screaming, "Oh my God, oh my God!"&lt;ref name=yes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larkin|2007|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Klebold asked Schnurr if she believed in the existence of God; when Schnurr replied she did, Klebold asked "Why?" and commented "God is gay" before walking from the table.&lt;ref name=yes/&gt;

Harris approached another table where two girls were hiding. He bent down to look at them and dismissed them as "pathetic".&lt;ref name=librev/&gt;&lt;ref name=remem/&gt; Harris then moved to another table where he fired twice, injuring 16-year-olds Nicole Nowlen and John Tomlin. Tomlin moved out from under the table. Harris then taunted Tomlin's attempt at escape before Klebold shot him repeatedly, killing him.&lt;ref name=OOL/&gt; Harris then walked back over to the other side of the table where Townsend lay dead. Behind the table, a 16-year-old girl named Kelly Fleming had, like Bree Pasquale, sat next to the table rather than beneath it due to a lack of space. Harris shot Fleming with his shotgun, hitting her in the back and killing her instantly.&lt;ref name=OOL/&gt; He shot at the table behind Fleming, hitting Townsend and Kreutz again, and wounding 18-year-old Jeanna Park.&lt;ref name=librev /&gt; An [[autopsy]] later revealed that Townsend died from the earlier gunshots inflicted by Klebold.&lt;ref name=autopsy/&gt;

The shooters moved to the center of the library, where they reloaded their weapons at a table. Harris then pointed his carbine under a table, but the student he was aiming at moved out of the way. Harris turned his gun back on the student and told him to identify himself. It was John Savage, an acquaintance of Klebold's. He asked Klebold what they were doing, to which he shrugged and answered, "killing people." Savage asked if they were going to kill him. Possibly because of a fire alarm, Klebold said, "What?" Savage asked again whether they were going to kill him. Klebold said no, and told him to run. Savage fled, escaping through the library's main entrance.&lt;ref name=librev /&gt;

After Savage left, one of the gunmen stated "This is what we've been waiting for all our lives."&lt;ref&gt;Crystal Woodman's statement, JC-001-00635&lt;/ref&gt; Harris turned and fired his carbine at the table directly north of where they had been, hitting the ear and hand of 15-year-old Daniel Mauser. Mauser reacted by shoving a chair at Harris; Harris fired again and hit Mauser in the center of the face at close range, killing him by breaking his neck.&lt;ref name=OOL/&gt; Both shooters moved south and fired randomly under another table, critically injuring two 17-year-olds, Jennifer Doyle and Austin Eubanks, and fatally wounding 17-year-old Corey DePooter. DePooter was later credited with having kept his friends calm during the ordeal. He was the last to die in the massacre, at 11:35&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name=timeline1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=librev /&gt;

There were no further victims. They had killed 10 people in the library and wounded 12. Of the 56 library hostages, 34 remained unharmed. Investigators would later find that the shooters had enough ammunition to have killed them all.&lt;ref name=timeline1 /&gt; Throughout the library massacre, the gunmen seemed to be enjoying themselves, shouting things like "yahoo" after shooting.&lt;ref name=librev /&gt;

At this point, several witnesses later said they heard the shooters comment that they no longer found a thrill in shooting their victims. Klebold was quoted as saying, "Maybe we should start [[stabbing|knifing]] people, that might be more fun." They moved away from the table and went toward the library's main counter. Harris threw a Molotov cocktail toward the southwestern end of the library, but it failed to explode. Harris then went around the east side of the counter and Klebold joined him from the west; they converged close to where Todd had moved after having been wounded.

Klebold pulled out a chair, pointed his TEC-9 at Todd, and commented "Look what we have here." Harris seemed disoriented from his broken nose, and asked "What?" Klebold responded "Just some fat fuck". Todd was wearing a white hat. Klebold asked if he was a jock, and when Todd said no Klebold responded "Well, that's good. We don't like jocks." Klebold then demanded to see his face, Todd partly lifted his hat so his face would remain obscured. When Klebold asked Todd to give him one reason why he should not kill him, Todd said: "I don't want trouble." Klebold responded back angrily "Trouble? You don't even know what fucking trouble is!" He also remarked "You used to call me a [[faggot (slang)|fag]]. Who's a fag now?!" Todd tried to correct himself: "That's not what I meant! I mean, I don't have a problem with you guys. I never will and I never did." Klebold then spoke to Harris, "I'm gonna let this fat fuck live, you can have at him if you want to."&lt;ref name=inju/&gt;

[[File:Columbine library fbi diagram.jpg|thumb|350px|An FBI diagram of the library, with locations of fatalities]]
Harris did not pay much attention and said "Let's go to the commons." Klebold turned and fired a single shot into an open library staff break room, hitting a small television. Before they left, Klebold slammed a chair down on top of the computer terminal and several books on the library counter, directly above the bureau where Patti Nielson had hidden.

The two walked out of the library at 11:36&amp;nbsp;a.m., ending the hostage situation there. Cautiously, fearing the shooters' return, 34 uninjured and 10 injured survivors began to evacuate the library through the north door, which led to the sidewalk adjacent to the west entrance. Kacey Ruegsegger was evacuated from the library by Craig Scott. Had she not been evacuated at this point, Ruegsegger would likely have bled to death from her injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/columbine-survivor-in-rose-parade/article_b0245b7c-acc0-5143-b019-684323905931.html/|title=Columbine survivor in Rose Parade|accessdate=August 20, 2016|newspaper=Casper Star Tribune|date=December 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Ireland, unconscious, and Lisa Kreutz, unable to move, remained in the building.&lt;ref name=librev&gt;Columbine Report, {{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/LIBRARY_TEXT.htm |title=Findings of Library Events |date=May 15, 2000 |accessdate=December 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115161834/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/LIBRARY_TEXT.htm |archive-date=November 15, 2012 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patti Nielson joined Brian Anderson and the three library staff in the exterior break room, into which Klebold had earlier fired shots, and locked themselves in.

===12:08 p.m.: Suicide===
After leaving the library, the gunmen entered the science area, where they threw a small Molotov cocktail into an empty storage closet. It caused a fire, which was extinguished by a teacher hidden in an adjacent room. The gunmen proceeded toward the south hallway, where they shot into an empty science room. At approximately 11:44&amp;nbsp;a.m., they were captured on the school security cameras as they re-entered the cafeteria. The recording shows Harris kneeling on the landing and firing a single shot toward one of the propane bombs left in the cafeteria, in an unsuccessful attempt to detonate it. As Klebold approached the propane bomb and examined it, Harris took a drink from one of the cups left behind. Klebold lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it at the propane bomb. They left the cafeteria at 11:46&amp;nbsp;a.m, as the Molotov cocktail exploded.&lt;ref name=event1/&gt; The gallon of fuel attached to the bomb ignited, causing a fire that was extinguished by the [[fire sprinkler]]s.&lt;ref name=timeline1/&gt;

After leaving the cafeteria, they returned to the main north and south hallways of the school, shooting aimlessly. They walked through the south hallway into the main office before returning to the north hallway. On several occasions, they looked through the windows of classroom doors, making eye contact with students hidden inside, but they never tried to enter any of the rooms. They taunted students hidden inside a bathroom, making such comments as: "We know you're in there" and "Let's kill anyone we find in here," but never attempted to enter the bathroom. At 11:55&amp;nbsp;a.m., they returned to the cafeteria, and briefly entered the school kitchen. They returned up the staircase and into the south hallway at 11:58&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name=timeline1/&gt;

They reentered the library, perhaps to watch their car bombs detonate, which had been set to explode at noon, but which failed.&lt;ref name=guidebomb /&gt; The library was empty of surviving students except for the unconscious Patrick Ireland and the injured Lisa Kreutz. Once inside, at 12:02&amp;nbsp;p.m., they shot through the west windows at police, who returned fire. Nobody was injured in the exchange.&lt;ref name=timeline1/&gt;

By approximately 12:08&amp;nbsp;p.m., both gunmen had committed suicide. In a subsequent interview, Kreutz recalled hearing a comment such as, "You in the library," around this time. Harris sat down with his back to a bookshelf and fired his shotgun through the [[Palate|roof of his mouth]]; Klebold went down on his knees and shot himself in the left temple with his TEC-9. An article by ''[[The Rocky Mountain News]]'' stated that Patti Nielson overheard them shout "One! Two! Three!" in unison, just before a loud boom.&lt;ref name=Fatal&gt;{{cite news |last=Bartels |first=Lynn |author2=Carla Crowder |url=http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/shooting/0822fata1.shtml |title=Fatal Friendship |newspaper=[[The Rocky Mountain News]] |date=1999 |accessdate=September 10, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221031521/http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/shooting/0822fata1.shtml |archivedate=February 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nielson said at no time had she ever spoken with either of the writers of the article,&lt;ref&gt;[http://acolumbinesite.com/reports/cr/p0001-0100.pdf Progress Report, Case # 99-16215] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904084603/http://www.acolumbinesite.com/reports/cr/p0001-0100.pdf |date=September 4, 2015 }} pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; and evidence suggests otherwise. Just before committing suicide, Klebold lit a Molotov cocktail on a nearby table, underneath which lay Patrick Ireland, which caused the tabletop to momentarily catch fire. Underneath the scorched film of material was a piece of Harris's brain matter, suggesting Harris had shot himself by this point.&lt;ref&gt;JC-001-008937&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' published two photos of Harris and Klebold after their suicides, showing both dead laying on their backs, and the guns in seemingly curious locations, such as Klebold's right hand laying on his gun despite his being left-handed, and leading to speculation that Harris shot Klebold before killing himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The National Enquirer|title=Columbine Killers|date=June 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the photographs were taken after [[SWAT]] had checked the bodies for bombs and booby-traps, and likely kicked Klebold onto his back. The placement of his blood and baseball cap suggest he died face down on Harris's legs.&lt;ref&gt;JC-001-012322&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Storytellers - "Columbine High School" (May 2016).ogg|thumb|A survivor recalls the events of the day]]
A total of 188 rounds of ammunition were fired by the perpetrators during the massacre. Harris fired nearly twice as much as Klebold; he fired his carbine rifle a total of 96 times, and discharged his shotgun 25 times. Klebold fired the TEC-9 handgun 55 times, while he discharged a total of 12 rounds from his double-barreled shotgun. Additionally, law enforcement officers fired a total of 141 rounds during exchanges of gunfire with the shooters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SHOOT_TEAM_TEXT.htm|title=The Critical Incident Team|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315125026/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SHOOT_TEAM_TEXT.htm|archive-date=March 15, 2017|dead-url=no|accessdate=April 9, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnnrep&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/05/15/columbine.report.04/ |title=Report: 12 killed at Columbine in first 16 minutes |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=May 16, 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818101434/http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/05/15/columbine.report.04/ |archivedate=August 18, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crisis ends==

=== SWAT response===
By noon, SWAT teams were stationed outside the school, and ambulances started taking the wounded to local hospitals. A call for additional ammunition for police officers in case of a shootout came at 12:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. Authorities reported pipe bombs by 1&amp;nbsp;p.m., and two SWAT teams entered the school at 1:09&amp;nbsp;p.m., moving from classroom to classroom, discovering hidden students and faculty.&lt;ref name=SWAT /&gt; They entered at the end of the school opposite the library, hampered by old maps and unaware a new wing had recently been added. They were also hampered by the sound of the fire alarms.&lt;ref name=lesson/&gt;

===Leawood Elementary===
Meanwhile, families of students and staff were asked to gather at nearby Leawood Elementary School to await information. All students, teachers, and school employees were taken away, questioned, and offered medical care in small holding areas before being bussed to meet with their family members at Leawood Elementary. Some of the victims families were told to wait on one final school bus that never came.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mauser|2012|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The boy in the window===
Patrick Ireland had regained and lost consciousness several times after being shot by Klebold. Paralyzed on his right side, he crawled to the library windows where, on live television, at 2:38&amp;nbsp;p.m., he stretched out the window, intending to fall into the arms of two SWAT team members standing on the roof of an emergency vehicle, but instead falling directly onto the vehicle's roof in a pool of blood. He became known as "the boy in the window".&lt;ref name=five/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 14, 2000 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/04/14/columbine/main183922.shtml |title='Boy In The Window' Won't Look Back |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=October 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128060501/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/04/14/columbine/main183922.shtml |archive-date=January 28, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were later criticized for allowing Ireland to drop more than seven feet to the ground while doing nothing to try to ensure he could be lowered to the ground safely or break his fall. Lisa Kreutz, shot in the shoulder, arms, hand, and thigh, remained laying in the library. She had tried to move but became light-headed. Kreutz kept track of time by the sound of the school's bells until police arrived.

=== 1 bleeding to death===
At 2:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. students placed a sign in the window: "1 bleeding to death," in order to alert police and medical personnel of Dave Sanders' location in the science room.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Police initially feared it was a ruse by the shooters.  A shirt was also tied to the doorknob. At 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. this was spotted, and by 2:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. SWAT officers evacuated the room of students, and called for a paramedic.&lt;ref name=SWAT /&gt; Hancey and Starkey were reluctant to leave Sanders behind.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=hancey /&gt; By 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., the SWAT officers decided a paramedic was not coming or could not get in, and opted to move Sanders themselves, and placed him in a chair. As they did so, a paramedic arrived, and found Sanders had no pulse.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SWAT /&gt; He had died in the science room of his injuries before he could receive medical care. He was the only teacher to die in the shooting.

=== Suicide mission; estimated 25 dead ===
Kreutz was finally evacuated at 3:22&amp;nbsp;p.m., along with Patti Nielson, Brian Anderson and the three library staff who had hidden in the break room. Officials found the bodies in the library by 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name=SWAT&gt;Columbine Report, SWAT&lt;/ref&gt; By 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Sheriff Stone made an initial estimate of 25 dead students and teachers, fifty wounded, and referred to the massacre as a "suicide mission."&lt;ref name=SWAT /&gt;&lt;ref name=twfive&gt;{{cite web|title=As many as 25 dead in Colorado school attack|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9904/20/school.shooting.08/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  US [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] issued a statement.&lt;ref name=twfive/&gt;

=== Bomb squad response ===
[[File:President Clinton's Remarks Regarding Columbine HS Shooting (1999).webm|thumb|President Clinton in the aftermath]]
Stone said that police officers were searching the bodies of the gunmen. They feared they had used their pipe bombs to booby-trap corpses, including their own. At 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. the school was declared safe. At 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., additional officers were called in, as more explosives were found in the parking lot and on the roof. By 6:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., officials had found a bomb in Klebold's car in the parking lot, set to detonate the gas tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9904/21/school.shooting.01/|title=Colorado school shooters identified|date=April 21, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stone then marked the entire school as a crime scene.

At 10:40&amp;nbsp;p.m., a member of the bomb squad, who was attempting to dispose of an un-detonated pipe bomb, accidentally lit a striking match attached to the bomb by brushing it against the wall of the ordnance disposal trailer. The bomb detonated inside the trailer but no one was injured.&lt;ref name=bombsum /&gt;

The bomb squad disrupted the car bomb. Klebold's car was repaired and, in 2006, put up for auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/columbine-killer-s-car-back-on-market|title=Columbine Killer's Car Back on Market}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immediate aftermath==
On the morning of April 21, bomb squads combed the high school. By 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. the official death toll of 15 was released.&lt;ref name=after /&gt; The estimate was ten over the true count, but close to the total count of wounded students. The total count of deaths was 12 students (14 including the shooters) and one teacher; 20 students and one teacher were injured as a result of the shootings. Three more victims were injured indirectly as they tried to escape the school. It was then the worst school shooting in US history.&lt;ref name=gina /&gt;

At 10&amp;nbsp;a.m., the bomb squad declared the building safe for officials to enter. By 11:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., a spokesman of the sheriff declared the investigation underway. Thirteen of the bodies were still inside the high school as investigators photographed the building.&lt;ref name=after&gt;{{Cite web | title=Columbine Shooting Aftermath – 1999 | url=http://www.acolumbinesite.com/after/1999.html | publisher=acolumbinesite.com | accessdate=September 12, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828184438/http://acolumbinesite.com/after/1999.html | archive-date=August 28, 2016 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., a press conference was held by Jeffco District Attorney David Thomas and Sheriff John Stone, at which they said that they suspected others had helped plan the shooting. Formal identification of the dead had not yet taken place, but families of the children thought to have been killed had been notified.

Throughout the late afternoon and early evening, the bodies were gradually removed from the school and taken to the Jeffco Coroner's Office to be identified and autopsied. By 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., the names of many of the dead were known. An official statement was released, naming the 15 confirmed deaths and 27 injuries related to the massacre.&lt;ref name=after /&gt; On April 22, the bombs left in the kitchen were found.&lt;ref name=after/&gt;

In the days following the shootings, Rachel Scott's car and John Tomlin's truck became memorials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acolumbinesite.com/victim/memorial.php|title=Columbine Memorials}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and impromptu memorials were held in Clement Park. On April 30, carpenter Greg Zanis erected 15 six feet tall wooden crosses to honor those who had died at the school. Daniel Rohrbough's father cut down the two meant for the gunmen.&lt;ref name=after /&gt; There were also fifteen trees planted, and he cut down two of those as well.&lt;ref name=suit/&gt;

=== Search warrant press conference ===
Also on April 30, high-ranking officials of Jeffco and the Jeffco Sheriff's Office met to decide if they should reveal that Michael Guerra had drafted an affidavit for a search warrant of Harris's residence more than a year before the shootings, based on his previous investigation of Harris's website and activities.&lt;ref name=event1&gt;{{Cite web | title=April 20, 1999 | url=http://www.acolumbinesite.com/event/event1.html | publisher=acolumbinesite.com | accessdate=September 12, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918205249/http://www.acolumbinesite.com/event/event1.html | archive-date=September 18, 2016 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the affidavit's contents lacked the necessary [[probable cause]], they decided not to disclose this information at a press conference held on April 30, nor did they mention it in any other way.

Over the next two years, Guerra's original draft and investigative file documents were lost. In September 1999, a Jeffco investigator failed to find the documents during a secret search of the county's computer system. A second attempt in late 2000 found copies of the document within the Jeffco archives. Their loss was termed "troubling" by a [[grand jury]] convened after the file's existence was reported in April 2001.&lt;ref name=gjury&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.mnginteractive.com/media/paper36/Columbine_Grand_Jury_Report.pdf |title=Columbine Grand Jury Report |date=September 1, 2004 |publisher=District Court, City and County of Denver, Colorado |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040922095745/http://media.mnginteractive.com/media/paper36/Columbine_Grand_Jury_Report.pdf |archivedate=September 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was concealed by the Jeffco Sheriff's Office and not revealed until September 2001, resulting from an investigation by the TV show ''[[60 Minutes]]''. The documents were reconstructed and released to the public, but the original documents are still missing. The final grand jury investigation was released in September 2004.&lt;ref name=gjury /&gt;

=== Christian martyrdom ===
In the wake of the shooting, victims Rachel Scott and Cassie Bernall came to be regarded as [[Christian martyr]]s by [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christians]].&lt;ref name=yes/&gt;&lt;ref name=tof&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/c/cassie.htm | title=Columbine Student Cassie Bernall Said "Yes" When Asked By One of the Shooters if She Believed In God-Disputed! | accessdate=January 11, 2011 | publisher=TruthOrFiction.com | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010013639/http://truthorfiction.com/rumors/c/cassie.htm | archive-date=October 10, 2011 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable media attention focused upon Bernall, who had been killed by Harris in the library and who Harris was reported to have asked, "Do you believe in God?" immediately prior to her murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/17/columbine-massacre-gun-crime-us|title=The truth about Columbine|accessdate=October 9, 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=April 17, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011012515/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/17/columbine-massacre-gun-crime-us|archive-date=October 11, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernall was reported to have responded "Yes" to this question before her murder. Emily Wyant, the closest living witness to Bernall's death, denied that Bernall and Harris had such an exchange.&lt;ref name=belief&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-10/14/026r-101499-idx.html|title=Columbine Miracle: a Matter of Belief|accessdate=September 12, 2016|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=October 14, 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909020229/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-10/14/026r-101499-idx.html|archive-date=September 9, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closest living witness to Scott's death, Richard Castaldo, once claimed Harris asked Scott if she believed in God, and murdered her after she answered "You know I do", but this also appears to be untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://attackthesystem.com/2012/04/17/the-survivor-richard-castaldo-challenges-the-official-columbine-narrative/|author=Andy Nowicki|title=The Survivor: Richard Castaldo challenges the official Columbine narrative|date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survivor Valeen Schnurr claims that she was the one questioned as to her belief in God.&lt;ref name=belief /&gt; Joshua Lapp thought Bernall had been queried about her belief, but was unable to correctly point out where Bernall was located, and was closer to Schnurr during the shootings. Another witness, Craig Scott claimed the discussion was with Bernall. When asked to indicate where the conversation had been coming from, he pointed to where Schnurr was shot.&lt;ref name=tof /&gt;

=== We are Columbine ===
In August 1999, students returned to the school, and principal Frank Deangelis led a rally of students clad in "We are Columbine" shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/1999/08/17/victims-kin-bitter-at-columbine-rally-hs-opens-without-mention-of-massacre/|title=Victims Kin Bitter At Columbine Rally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Additional suicides ===
Several former students and teachers suffer from [[PTSD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=7300782&amp;page=1|title=Columbine Shootings 10 Years Later: Students, Teacher Still Haunted by Post-Traumatic Stress|last=Donaldson James|first=Susan|date=April 13, 2009|access-date=June 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427102132/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=7300782&amp;page=1|archive-date=April 27, 2013|dead-url=no|publisher=ABC News|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months after the shootings, Anne Marie Hochhalter's mother committed suicide.&lt;ref name="surfive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="five" /&gt; Greg Barnes, a student who witnessed Sanders get shot, committed suicide in May 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/col0506.htm|title=Song only clue to student's despair|date=May 6, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
Though the attack was planned as a terrorist attack which would cause "the most deaths in US history",&lt;ref name=tape2651/&gt; the motive has never been ascertained with confidence. Soon after the massacre, it was thought Harris and Klebold targeted jocks, blacks, and Christians.&lt;ref name=hist /&gt; Both sought to provide answers in the journals and video tapes, but investigators found them lacking. In a letter provided with the May 15 report on the Columbine attack, Sheriff John Stone and Undersheriff John A. Dunaway wrote they "cannot answer the most fundamental question—why?"&lt;ref name=evid/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnnrep /&gt;

=== FBI's theory: Psychopath and depressive ===
The conclusion of the FBI was mental illness, that Harris was a clinical [[Psychopathy|psychopath]], and Klebold was [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]].&lt;ref name=slatecol /&gt; Dr. Dwayne Fuselier, the supervisor in charge of the Columbine investigation, would later remark: "I believe Eric went to the school to kill and didn't care if he died, while Dylan wanted to die and didn't care if others died as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klebold|2016|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1998, as part of his diversion program, Harris wrote a letter of apology to the owner of the van.&lt;ref name=dive /&gt; Around the same time, he derided him in his journal, stating that he believed himself to have the right to steal something if he wanted to.&lt;ref name=HJ41298&gt;Harris journal, April 12, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbine-online.com/journals/columbine-eric-harris-big-lie.htm|title=Eric's big lie|last=Cullen|first=Dave|publisher=Columbine Online|accessdate=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By far the most prevalent theme in Klebold's journals is his private despair at his lack of success with women, which he refers to as an "infinite sadness."&lt;ref&gt;Klebold journal, My thoughts, September 5, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klebold|2016|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klebold had repeatedly documented his desires to commit suicide, and his final remark in the Basement Tapes, shortly before the attack, is a resigned statement made as he glances away from the camera: "Just know I'm going to a better place. I didn't like life too much."&lt;ref name=tape333/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klebold|2016|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this theory, used by Dave Cullen for his 2009 book ''[[Columbine (book)|Columbine]],'' Harris had been the mastermind, having a [[Messiah complex|messianic-level]] [[superiority complex]], and hoping to demonstrate his superiority to the world; Klebold was a follower who primarily participated in the massacre as a means to simply end his life.&lt;ref name=slatecol&gt;{{cite news |last=Cullen |first=Dave |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2004/04/the_depressive_and_the_psychopath.html |title=The Depressive and the Psychopath |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=April 20, 2004 |accessdate=October 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018141017/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2004/04/the_depressive_and_the_psychopath.html |archive-date=October 18, 2014 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klebold|2016|pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this theory has met with criticism.&lt;ref name=Salon/&gt; For instance, it was Klebold and not Harris who first mentioned going on a killing spree in his journal,&lt;ref name=kj11397/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/news/author-jeff-kass-on-how-his-columbine-theories-differ-from-dave-cullens-5884190|title=Author Jeff Kass on how his Columbine theories differ from Dave Cullen's|date=May 7, 2009|author=Michael Roberts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is evidence to suggest both were depressed, such as Harris being prescribed antidepressants. Sheriff Stone said "I've talked to students who were shot by Klebold. He was not just a follower."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rense.com/politics4/stone.htm|title=Sheriff Stone Convinced Others Involved In Columbine Slaughter|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other attempts to diagnose Harris and Klebold with mental illness. Peter Langman believes Harris was a psychopath and Klebold was [[schizotypal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Langman|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Aubrey Immelman published a personality profile of Harris, based on journal entries and personal communication, and believes the materials suggested behavior patterns consistent with a "[[malignant narcissism]]&amp;nbsp;... pathological [[narcissistic personality disorder]] with [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]] and [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] features, along with some [[paranoia|paranoid]] traits, and unconstrained [[aggression]]". The report notes that such a profile should not be construed as a direct psychiatric diagnosis, which is based on face-to-face interviews, formal [[psychological testing]], and collection of collateral information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric Harris: Personality Profile |first=Aubrey |last=Immelman |date=August 2004 |url=http://www.csbsju.edu/uspp/Criminal-Profiling/Columbine_Eric-Harris-profile.html |publisher=[[College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911215748/http://www.csbsju.edu/uspp/Criminal-Profiling/Columbine_Eric-Harris-profile.html |archivedate=September 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other factors explored===

====Bullying====
The link between bullying and school violence has attracted increasing attention since the massacre. Both of the shooters were classified as [[Intellectual giftedness|gifted children]] who had allegedly been [[Peer victimization|victims of bullying]] for four years. Early stories following the shootings charged that school administrators and teachers at Columbine had long condoned a climate of bullying by the so-called jocks or athletes, allowing an atmosphere of intimidation and resentment to fester.&lt;ref name="kassb"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/shooting/1003col4.shtml|title=Students tell of bullying at Columbine High|author=Jeff Kass|date=October 3, 2000|newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221025234/http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/shooting/1003col4.shtml|archivedate=February 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics said this could have contributed to triggering the perpetrators' extreme violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Lorraine |author2=Dale Russakoff |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/june99/columbine12.htm |title=Dissecting Columbine's Cult of the Athlete |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 12, 1999 |page=A1 |accessdate=October 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009035341/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/june99/columbine12.htm |archive-date=October 9, 2014 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, [[Homophobia|homophobic]] remarks were directed at Klebold and Harris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/043099colo-voices.html |title=The Community: Columbine Students Talk of Disaster and Life |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 30, 1999 |accessdate=October 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611192303/http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/043099colo-voices.html |archive-date=June 11, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Klebold said on the Basement Tapes, "You've been giving us shit for years."&lt;ref name=tape2651/&gt;

Accounts from various parents and school staffers describe bullying at the school as "rampant."&lt;ref&gt;Pankratz, Howard (October 3, 2000). [http://extras.denverpost.com/news/col1003a.htm "Columbine bullying no myth, panel told"]. ''The Denver Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan Vanderau, a friend of Klebold, and Alisa Owen, Harris's eighth-grade science partner, reported that Harris and Klebold were constantly picked on. Vanderau noted that a "cup of fecal matter" was thrown at them.&lt;ref name=under&gt;''Investigative Reports: Columbine: Understanding Why''. [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]]. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Klebold is known to have remarked to his father of his hatred of the jocks at Columbine, adding that Harris in particular had been victimized. Klebold had stated, "They sure give Eric hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klebold|2016|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chad Laughlin stated "A lot of the tension in the school came from the class above us...There were people fearful of walking by a table where you knew you didn't belong, stuff like that. Certain groups certainly got preferential treatment across the board." Brown also noted Harris was born with mild [[Pectus excavatum|chest indent]]. This made him reluctant to take his shirt off in gym class, and other students would laugh at him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|2002|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after the massacre, an analysis by officials at the U.S. Secret Service of 37 [[Murder#Degrees of murder|premeditated]] school shootings found that bullying, which some of the shooters described "in terms that approached torment", played the major role in more than two-thirds of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/15/AR2006051501103.html | work=[[The Washington Post]] | first=Sandra G. | last=Boodman | title=Gifted and Tormented | date=May 16, 2006 |accessdate=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar theory was expounded by Brooks Brown in his book on the massacre, ''No Easy Answers''; he noted that teachers commonly looked the other way when confronted with bullying, and that whenever Klebold and Harris were the recipients of such incidents from the jocks at Columbine, they would make statements such as: "Don't worry, man. It happens all the time!" if anyone expressed shock or surprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/june99/columbine12.htm|title=Dissecting Columbine's Cult of the Athlete|accessdate=October 15, 2016|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 12, 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309020347/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/june99/columbine12.htm|archive-date=March 9, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dave Cullen disputes the theory of "revenge for bullying" as a motivation. While acknowledging the pervasiveness of bullying in high schools including CHS, he has claimed they were not victims of bullying. He said Harris was more often the perpetrator than victim of bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cullen|2009|pages=158–159, 208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ketchup incident=====
During junior year, both Harris and Klebold had been confronted by a group of youths at the school—all members of the football team—who had sprayed them with ketchup and mustard while referring to the pair as "faggots" and "[[queer]]s".&lt;ref name=kle189&gt;{{Harvnb|Klebold|2016|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brown, "People surrounded them in the commons and squirted ketchup packets all over them, laughing at them, calling them faggots" "That happened while teachers watched. They couldn't fight back. They wore the ketchup all day and went home covered with it." Laughlin stated "I caught the tail end of one really horrible incident, and I know Dylan told his mother that it was the worst day of his life."&lt;ref name=kle189 /&gt; That incident, according to Laughlin, involved seniors pelting Klebold with "ketchup-covered [[tampon]]s" in the commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|title=Forgiving my Columbine High School friend, Dylan Klebold|newspaper=Denver Westword Post|author=Prendergast, Alan|date=April 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social isolation====
During and after the initial investigations, social cliques within high schools such as Trench Coat Mafia were widely discussed. One perception formed was that both Klebold and Harris were outcasts who had been isolated from their classmates, prompting feelings of helplessness, insecurity, and [[clinical depression|depression]], as well as a strong need for attention.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; This concept has been questioned, as both Harris and Klebold had a close circle of friends and a wider informal social group.&lt;ref name=ten/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cullen|2009|pages=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, David (April 24, 2004). [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/24/opinion/the-columbine-killers.html "The Columbine Killers"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204104540/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/24/opinion/the-columbine-killers.html|date=February 4, 2017}}. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Harris's last journal entries read: "I hate you people for leaving me out of so many fun things."&lt;ref name=HJ4399 /&gt; "The lonely man strikes with absolute rage" wrote Klebold.&lt;ref&gt;Klebold's day planner&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Brown described them as the school's worst outcasts, "the losers of the losers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bsuenglish.com/dlrOLD/past/issue1_lynch.pdf|title=''Ball State University'' (p. 3.)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larkin|2007|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political terrorism====
[[Sociologist]] [[Ralph Larkin]] has theorized the massacre was to trigger a revolution of outcast students and the dispossessed; "as an overtly political act in the name of oppressed students victimized by their peers...The Columbine shootings redefined such acts not merely as revenge but as a means of protest of bullying, intimidation, social isolation, and public rituals of humiliation."&lt;ref name=larkin2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larkin|first=Ralph W.|year=2009|title=The Columbine legacy: Rampage shootings as political acts|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247751861_The_Columbine_LegacyRampage_Shootings_as_Political_Acts|dead-url=no|journal=[[American Behavioral Scientist]]|volume=52|pages=1309–1326|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403013535/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247751861_The_Columbine_LegacyRampage_Shootings_as_Political_Acts|archive-date=April 3, 2017|accessdate=April 2, 2017|number=9|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One author argues Columbine was only increasingly linked to terrorism after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Altheide |first=David L. |title=The Columbine Shootings and the Discourse of Fear |journal=American Behavioral Scientist |volume=52 |date=2009 |pages=1354–70 |doi=10.1177/0002764209332552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack occurred on April 20, [[Adolf Hitler]]'s birthday, which led to speculation in the media that the attack was political.{{refn|group=n|One teacher referred to Klebold's boots as "Nazi boots".&lt;ref name=librev /&gt;}} Some people, such as Robyn Anderson, stated that the pair were not obsessed with Nazism nor did they worship or admire Hitler in any way. Anderson stated, in retrospect, that there were many things the pair did not tell friends. Harris at least did revere the Nazis. He praised them often in his journal,&lt;ref&gt;e. g. Harris journal, November 17, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and some of his friends grew irritated at his frequent Nazi salutes and quotations in the months leading up to the shooting.&lt;ref name=hint&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9904/21/harris.profile.02/|title=Harris Hinted at violence to come|date=April 21, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a certain point, Harris realized he needed to reduce this behavior, for fear of revealing his plans.

The original date for the massacre may have been April 19,&lt;ref name=demon&gt;{{cite news|url=http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/shooting/0516bguy2.shtml|title=Demonic plan was months in making|last=Ryckman|first=Lisa|date=May 16, 2000|newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125214115/http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/shooting/0516bguy2.shtml|archivedate=January 25, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; like the Oklahoma City Bombing. On April 11, Harris said "there are 7 and 1/3 days left."&lt;ref&gt;Basement Tapes, "Reb's Tape", April 11, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; However, Harris wished for more ammunition from Mark Manes, for which one had to be 21 years old to obtain from [[K-Mart]], and Manes did not get it for him until the evening of the 19th, causing the massacre to happen on the 20th. Manes asked if Harris was going shooting that night. Harris replied he would tomorrow.&lt;ref name=Fatal/&gt; In 2001, K-Mart announced it would no longer sell handgun ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/29/news/mn-16465|title=Kmart Will Stop Selling Handgun Ammunition|last=Reports|first=From Times Wire|date=2001-06-29|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724020538/http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/29/news/mn-16465|archive-date=July 24, 2018|dead-url=no|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medication====
In one scheduled meeting with his appointed psychiatrist, Harris had complained of [[depression (mood)|depression]], anger, and suicidal thoughts. He was prescribed [[Zoloft]]. He complained of feeling restless and having trouble concentrating; his doctor switched him to [[Fluvoxamine|Luvox]], a similar [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cullen|2009|pages=214, 261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9904/29/luvox.explainer/|title=Columbine shooter was prescribed anti-depressant|last=Salvatore|first=Steve|date=April 29, 1999|accessdate=October 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126042048/http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9904/29/luvox.explainer/|archive-date=November 26, 2014|dead-url=no|publisher=[[CNN]]|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris wished to join the [[United States Marine Corps]]. His application to the Marines was rejected shortly before the shootings because of his taking Luvox.&lt;ref name=Fatal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kass|2009|pages=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the recruiting officer, Harris did not know about this rejection. However, for example Brooks Brown said he did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|2002|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Music====
Blame for the shootings was directed at a number of metal or 'dark music' bands.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;&lt;ref name=Powers&gt;{{cite news |last=Powers |first=Ann |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/25/weekinreview/the-nation-the-stresses-of-youth-the-strains-of-its-music.html |title=The Nation; The Stresses of Youth, The Strains of Its Music |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 25, 2000 |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518070833/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/25/weekinreview/the-nation-the-stresses-of-youth-the-strains-of-its-music.html |archive-date=May 18, 2016 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Harris and Klebold were fans of the [[Germans|German]] rock bands [[KMFDM]] and [[Rammstein]].&lt;ref name=Fatal/&gt; Harris was enrolled in [[German language|German]] class.&lt;ref name=Fatal/&gt; His website contained lyrics from both artists, such as KMFDM's "[[Xtort|Son of a Gun]]", "[[Symbols (album)|Stray Bullet]]", and "Waste", as well as translations for the songs done in German.

In the same blog post which threatened Brown, Harris wrote: "Ill just go to some downtown area in some big ass city and blow up and shoot everything I can. Feel no remorse, no sense of shame." The last sentence is a quote from the KMFDM song "[[Anarchy (song)|Anarchy]]". As above, Klebold wrote in Harris's yearbook "My wrath for January's incident will be godlike,"&lt;ref name=yearb/&gt; and he wore a shirt saying "Wrath" during the massacre. "Wrath" and "[[Godlike (song)|Godlike]]" are songs by KMFDM.

On April 20, 1999 KMFDM released the album [[Adios (KMFDM album)|''Adios'']]. Harris noted the coincidence of the album's title and release date in his journal "a subliminal final "Adios" tribute to Reb and Vodka. thanks KMFDM... I ripped the hell outa the system".&lt;ref&gt;Harris journal, December 20, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes "Godlike".

[[Sascha Konietzko]] of KMFDM issued a statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;First and foremost, KMFDM would like to express their deep and heartfelt sympathy for the parents, families and friends of the murdered and injured children in Littleton. We are sick and appalled, as is the rest of the nation, by what took place in Colorado yesterday.&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt;&lt;ref name=KMFDM&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kmfdm.net/ | title=KMFDM.net on April 27, 1999 from archive.org | publisher=KMFDM Inc | date=April 27, 1999 | accessdate=April 21, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19990427193333/http://www.kmfdm.net/ | archivedate = April 27, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;KMFDM are an art form—not a political party. From the beginning, our music has been a statement against war, oppression, fascism and violence against others. While some of the former band members are German as reported in the media, none of us condone any Nazi beliefs whatsoever.&lt;ref name=KMFDM /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/an-old-debate-emerges-in-wake-of-shooting-19990422 | author=Boehlert, Eric | title=An Old Debate Emerges in Wake of School Shooting|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]| publisher=Jann S.

They were avid fans of the movie ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'', and used the film's acronym, NBK, as a code for the massacre.&lt;ref name=Block /&gt; In February 1998, Klebold envisioned a massacre with a girl like in the film, writing "Soon...either ill commit suicide, or I'll get w.

In ''Doom'', the first gun you obtain after the handgun you start with is a pump-action shotgun.&lt;ref name=doom217&gt;{{Harvnb|id games|1995|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris named his sawn off, pump-action shotgun Arlene after a character in the [[Doom novels]].&lt;ref name=tape2651/&gt;&lt;ref name=HJ12398&gt;Harris journal, December 3, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basement Tapes, "Top Secret Rampart", late March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Harris said the gun was "straight out of ''Doom''".&lt;ref name=tape2651&gt;Basement Tapes, March 15, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Klebold had a TEC-9 and a sawn off, double-barreled shotgun.

==Perpetrators==
{{main|Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold}}

===Eric Harris===
Eric David Harris (April 9, 1981&amp;nbsp;– April 20, 1999) was born in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. The Harris family relocated often, as Harris's father was a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] transport pilot. His mother was a [[homemaker]]. The family moved from [[Plattsburgh, New York]], to Littleton, Colorado, in July 1993, when his father retired from military service.&lt;ref name=Suspects /&gt;

The Harris family lived in rented accommodations for the first three years that they lived in the Littleton area. During this time, he attended Ken Caryl Middle School, and Harris met Klebold.&lt;ref name=Fatal/&gt; In 1996, the Harris family purchased a house south of CHS. His older brother attended college at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=sides&gt;{{cite news|author1=Briggs, Bill |author2=Blevins, Jason |url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0502b.htm |title=A Boy With Many Sides |date=May 2, 1999|newspaper=[[Denver Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dylan Klebold===
Dylan Bennet Klebold ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|iː|b|oʊ|l|d}}; September 11, 1981&amp;nbsp;– April 20, 1999) was born in [[Lakewood, Colorado]].&lt;ref name=Suspects&gt;Columbine Report, {{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Suspects Text |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were [[Pacifism|pacifists]] and attended a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church with their children. Both Dylan and his older brother attended [[confirmation]] classes in accordance with the [[Confirmation#Lutheran view|Lutheran tradition]].&lt;ref name=mult1/&gt; As had been the case with his older brother, Klebold was named after a renowned poet&amp;nbsp;– in his case the playwright [[Dylan Thomas]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

At the family home, the Klebolds also observed some rituals in keeping with Klebold's maternal grandfather's [[Jews|Jewish]] heritage.&lt;ref name=mult1&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Leppek |title=Dylan Klebold led life of religious contradictions |url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/11140/edition_id/213/format/html/displaystory.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329233932/http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/11140/edition_id/213/format/html/displaystory.html |date=April 30, 1999 |archivedate=March 29, 2007 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Culver, Virginia (April 28, 1999). [http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0428d.htm "Klebolds 'loneliest people on the planet'"]. ''[[The Denver Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Klebold attended Normandy Elementary in Littleton, Colorado for the first two grades before transferring to Governor's Ranch Elementary and became part of the CHIPS ("Challenging High Intellectual Potential Students") program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C Shepard |url=http://acolumbinesite.com/chips.html |title=CHIPS - Challenging High Intellectual Potential Students |website=Acolumbinesite.com |date=1999-04-20 |accessdate=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found the transition to Ken Caryl Middle School difficult.&lt;ref name=Suspects/&gt;

Unlike the white caps of the jocks, Harris and Klebold wore black baseball caps. As was typical in the 1990s, they wore them backwards. Harris wore a KMFDM cap, and apparently did not wear it during the massacre.&lt;ref name=brooks4 /&gt; Klebold's cap had a [[Colorado Avalanche]] logo on the front and a [[Boston Red Sox]] logo sewn onto the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klebold|2016|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long-term impact==

=== School policy ===
Following the Columbine shooting, schools across the United States instituted new security measures such as see-through backpacks, metal detectors, school uniforms, and security guards. Some schools implemented school door numbering to improve public safety response. Several schools throughout the country resorted to requiring students to wear computer-generated IDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9908/16/school.safety/|title=Drills, new security measures mark return to schools|author=Gary Tuchman|date=August 16, 1999|accessdate=August 22, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050817113800/http://www.cnn.com/US/9908/16/school.safety/|archive-date=August 17, 2005|dead-url=no|publisher=[[CNN]]|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Zero-tolerance ====
Schools also adopted a zero tolerance approach to possession of weapons and threatening behavior by students.&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jjie.org/a-plot-with-a-scandal-a-close-look-at-the-kids-for-cash-documentary/|title=A Plot with a Scandal: A Closer Look at 'Kids for Cash' Documentary|author=Daryl Khan|date=10 February 2014|work=Juvenile Justice Information Exchange|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626132904/http://jjie.org/a-plot-with-a-scandal-a-close-look-at-the-kids-for-cash-documentary/|archive-date=June 26, 2015|dead-url=no|access-date=September 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite the effort, several [[social science]] experts feel the zero tolerance approach adopted in schools has been implemented too harshly, with [[unintended consequences]] creating other problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerointelligence.net/archives/000348.php|title=Five years after Columbine – is zero tolerance working?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621220507/http://www.zerointelligence.net/archives/000348.php|archivedate=June 21, 2008|deadurl=bot: unknown|accessdate=2008-06-21|df=mdy}}, ''zerointelligence.net''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schools renewed existing anti-bullying policies.&lt;ref name="kassb" /&gt; [[Rachel's Challenge]] was started by Rachel Scott's parents, and lectures schools about bullying and suicide.

===Police tactics===
Police departments reassessed their tactics and now train for Columbine-like situations after criticism over the slow response and progress of the SWAT teams during the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9908/18/columbine.SWAT.01/|title=Columbine tragedy was wakeup call for nation's SWAT teams|date=August 18, 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816063906/http://www.cnn.com/US/9908/18/columbine.SWAT.01/|archivedate=August 16, 2000|publisher=[[CNN]]|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheriff Stone did not seek reelection.

====Active shooter====
Police followed the traditional tactic at Columbine: surround the building, set up a perimeter, and contain the damage. That approach has been replaced by a tactic that takes into account the presence of an active shooter whose interest is to kill, not to take hostages, known as the Immediate Action Rapid Deployment tactic.  This tactic calls for a four-person team to advance into the site of any ongoing shooting, optimally a diamond-shaped wedge, but even with just a single officer if more are not available. Police officers using this tactic are trained to move toward the sound of gunfire and neutralize the shooter as quickly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Ronnie|date=June 2007|title=Marching to the Sound of Gunshots: Virginia Tech Incident Puts Emphasis on Active Shooter Response|journal=Law Enforcement Technology|volume=34|pages=54–63|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal is to stop the shooter at all costs; they are to walk past wounded victims, as the aim is to prevent the shooter from killing or wounding more. Dave Cullen has stated: "The active protocol has proved successful at numerous shootings...At [[Virginia Tech shooting|Virginia Tech]] alone, it probably saved dozens of lives."&lt;ref name=lesson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2009/04/the_four_most_important_lessons_of_columbine.html|title=The Four Most Important Lessons of Columbine|last=Cullen|first=Dave|date=April 29, 2009|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110145947/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2009/04/the_four_most_important_lessons_of_columbine.html|archive-date=November 10, 2014|dead-url=no|accessdate=October 15, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuits===
After the massacre, many survivors and relatives of deceased victims filed lawsuits.&lt;ref name=suit/&gt; Under Colorado state law at the time, the maximum a family could receive in a lawsuit against a government agency was $600,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/19991020-37-schoolma.html|title=School massacre spawns lawsuits|last=Weller|first=Robert|date=October 20, 1999|work=[[U-T San Diego]]|accessdate=October 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113152324/http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/19991020-37-schoolma.html|archive-date=January 13, 2014|dead-url=no|agency=[[Associated Press]]|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cases against the Jeffco police department and school district were dismissed by the federal court on the grounds of government immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/most-columbine-lawsuits-dismissed/|title=Most Columbine Lawsuits Dismissed|date=November 27, 2001|accessdate=January 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021160011/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/most-columbine-lawsuits-dismissed/|archive-date=October 21, 2014|dead-url=no|publisher=[[CBS News]]|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case against the sheriff's office regarding the death of Dave Sanders was not dismissed due to the police preventing paramedics from going to his aid for hours after they knew the gunmen were dead. The case was settled out of court in August 2002 for $1,500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2002/aug/21/sanders-settles-columbine-suit/|title=Sanders settles Columbine suit|last1=Abbott|first1=Karen|date=August 21, 2002|work=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|accessdate=January 13, 2014|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140113110239/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2002/aug/21/sanders-settles-columbine-suit/|archive-date=January 13, 2014|dead-url=yes|last2=Able|first2=Charley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorials===

A permanent memorial "to honor and remember the victims of the April 20, 1999 shootings at Columbine High School" was dedicated on September 21, 2007, in Clement Park. The memorial fund raised $1.5 million in donations over eight years of planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbine Memorial&amp;nbsp;—Overview |publisher=The Foothills Foundation |url=http://www.columbinememorial.org/Overview.asp |accessdate=May 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430163123/http://www.columbinememorial.org/Overview.asp |archivedate=April 30, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun control===
The shooting resulted in calls for more [[gun control]] measures. In 2000, federal and state legislation was introduced that would require safety locks on firearms as well as ban the importation of high-capacity ammunition magazines. Though laws were passed that made it a crime to buy guns for criminals and minors, there was considerable controversy over legislation pertaining to background checks at gun shows. There was concern in the gun lobby over restrictions on [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] rights in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/03/07/clinton.guns.03 |title=Clinton pushes Congress to pass new gun control legislation |accessdate=2008-03-16 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316020955/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/03/07/clinton.guns.03 |archivedate=March 16, 2008 |df=mdy }}.

===Popular culture===
{{main|Columbine High School massacre in popular culture}}
"Columbine" has since become a euphemism for a school shooting, rather like "[[going postal]]". A video game called [[Super Columbine Massacre RPG!]] was based on the massacre.

====Film====
The 2016 biographical film ''[[I'm Not Ashamed]]'', based on the journals of Rachel Scott, includes glimpses of Harris's and Klebold's lives and interactions with other students at CHS.

=====Fiction=====
The 1999 black comedy, ''[[Duck! The Carbine High Massacre]]'' is inspired by the Columbine massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Buchanan|title=Duck!

Also in 2003, the [[Uwe Boll]] film ''[[Heart of America (film)|Heart of America: Home Room]]'' was released. The film's main plot focuses on two bullied students, who plan to carry out a school shooting on the last day of school after being tortured by the school jocks. The main character has second thoughts and quits at the last minute, while the other carries out the plan with a female accomplice. The film is believed to have been inspired by several shootings that are listed before the credits, Columbine being among them.

=====Documentary=====
The first documentary on Columbine may have been the [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] documentary ''Lost Boys'' in 2000. The 2002 Michael Moore documentary film ''Bowling for Columbine'' won several awards. Also in 2002, [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] made "Columbine: Understanding Why".&lt;ref name=under /&gt;

In 2004, the shooting was dramatized in the documentary ''[[Zero Hour (2004 TV series)|Zero Hour]]''. In 2007, the massacre was documented in an episode of the [[National Geographic Channel]] documentary series, ''The Final Report''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/episodes/columbine/ ''The Final Report: Columbine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502042413/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/episodes/columbine/ |date=May 2, 2013 }}.

====Music====
[[Foster the People]]'s "[[Pumped Up Kicks]]" was inspired by the massacre.

Columbine students Jonathan and Stephen Cohen wrote a song called ''Friend Of Mine (Columbine)'', which briefly received airplay in the US after being performed at a memorial service broadcast on nationwide television. The song was pressed to CD, with the proceeds benefiting families affected by the massacre, and over 10,000 copies were ordered. Shortly following the release of the CD single, the song was also featured on the ''[[Lullaby for Columbine]]'' CD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denver-rmn.com/shooting/0420cohe7.shtml |title=Farewell performance for Columbine song |accessdate=December 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023102448/http://www.denver-rmn.com/shooting/0420cohe7.shtml |archivedate=October 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the advent of online social media, a [[fandom]] for shooters Harris and Klebold has had a documented presence on social media sites, especially [[Tumblr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewire.com/culture/2014/09/how-tumblrs-true-crime-fandom-reacted-to-the-escape-of-a-school-shooter/380124/ |title=How Tumblr's True Crime Fandom Reacted to the Escape of a School Shooter |last=John |first=Arit |date=September 12, 2014 |website=The Wire |accessdate=December 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222112335/http://www.thewire.com/culture/2014/09/how-tumblrs-true-crime-fandom-reacted-to-the-escape-of-a-school-shooter/380124/ |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans of Harris and Klebold refer to themselves as "Columbiners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theawl.com/2012/10/the-killer-crush-from-columbiners-to-beliebers |title=Killer Crush: The Horror of Teen Girls, from Columbiners to Beliebers |last=Monroe |first=Rachel |date=October 5, 2012 |website=The Awl |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208095151/http://www.theawl.com/2012/10/the-killer-crush-from-columbiners-to-beliebers |archivedate=December 8, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; An article published in 2015 in the ''Journal of Transformative Works'', a scholarly journal which focuses on the sociology of fandoms, noted that Columbiners were not fundamentally functionally different from more mainstream fandoms. Columbiners create [[fan art]] and [[fan fiction]], and have a scholarly interest in the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/671/545 |title=Fans of Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold |last=Rico |first=Andrew |publisher=Journal of Transformative Works |date=2015 |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208135329/http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/671/545 |archive-date=December 8, 2015 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copycats===
The Columbine shootings influenced subsequent school shootings.&lt;ref name=tape/&gt;&lt;ref name=hands&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/04/18/vtech.nbc/|title=Shooter: 'You have blood on your hands'|date=April 18, 2007|accessdate=October 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018123847/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/04/18/vtech.nbc/|archive-date=October 18, 2014|dead-url=no|publisher=[[CNN]]|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many school shooting plots mention it. Shortly after, a rash of copycat threats led to the closing of entire districts.  One arrested student boasted he could "outdo" its number of casualties.&lt;ref name=inter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayhem.net/Crime/intermittent.html|title=Intermittent Explosive Disorder |publisher=mayhem.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220034110/http://mayhem.net/Crime/intermittent.html|archive-date=December 20, 2010|dead-url=no|access-date=March 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first copycat may have been the [[W. R. Myers High School shooting]], just 8 days later, when a 14-year old Canadian student went into his school at lunchtime, with a sawed-off .22 rifle under his dark blue trench coat, and opened fire, killing one student.&lt;ref name=larkin2009/&gt; A month after the massacre, [[Heritage High School (Conyers, Georgia)|Heritage High School]] in [[Conyers, Georgia]] had a shooting which Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] called a  Columbine "copycat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9905/20/conyers.school.shooting.03/|title=CNN - 6 hurt in Georgia high school shooting - May 20, 1999|website=www.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A friend of Harris and Klebold, Eric Veik, was arrested after threatening to "finish the job" at CHS in October, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/shot1022a.htm|archive-date=August 19, 2000|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20000819094021/www.denverpost.com/news/shot1022a.htm|date=October 22, 1999|title=Threat suspect craved attention, schoolmates say|author=Kevin Simpson}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====USA====
In 2001, [[Charles Andrew Williams]], the [[Santana High School]] shooter, reportedly told his friends that he was going to "pull a Columbine," though none of them took him seriously.&lt;ref name=inter/&gt;
In 2005, [[Jeff Weise]], an American Indian who wore a trench coat, killed his grandfather, who was a police officer, and his girlfriend. He took his grandfather's weapon and his squad car, and drove to his former high school in [[Red Lake shootings|Red Lake]] and murdered several students before committing suicide. In an apparent reference to Columbine, he asked one student if they believed in God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/22/usgunviolence.usa|title=Ten dead in US school shooting|first=Jeremy|last=Lennard|date=March 22, 2005|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Convicted students Brian Draper and Torey Adamcik of [[Pocatello High School]] in Idaho, who [[Murder of Cassie Jo Stoddart|murdered their classmate Cassie Jo Stoddart]], mentioned Harris and Klebold in their homemade videos, and were reportedly planning a "Columbine-like" shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=in%20idco%2020100920169.xml&amp;docbase=cslwar3-2007-curr|title=Stoddart v.

He quoted Harris prior to the attack under the heading "Christianity is YOUR Columbine".&lt;ref name=larkin2009/&gt;

In a self-made video recording sent to the news media by [[Seung-Hui Cho]] prior to his committing the Virginia Tech shootings, he referred to the Columbine massacre as an apparent motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/MindMoodNews/story?id=7345607&amp;page=1|title=Psychology of Virginia Tech, Columbine Killers Still Baffles Experts|author=Susan Donaldson James|date=April 16, 2009|accessdate=October 15, 2014|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the recording, he wore a backwards baseball cap and referred to Harris and Klebold as "martyrs."&lt;ref name=hands /&gt; Adam Lanza, the perpetrator of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] had "an obsession with mass murders, in particular the April 1999 shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25097127 |title=Newtown gunman Adam Lanza had 'obsession' with Columbine|publisher=BBC News |date=November 26, 2013 |accessdate=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====International====

The perpetrator of the [[Emsdetten school shooting]] praised Harris in his diary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/bosse_journal_1.0.pdf Sebastian Bosse journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, Pekka-Eric Auvinen imitated Columbine with a shooting in [[Jokela school shooting|Jokela]] in [[Tuusula, Finland]]. He wore a shirt saying "Humanity is Overrated".&lt;ref name=larkin2009/&gt;
The perpetrator of the [[Dawson College shooting]] wrote a note praising Harris and Klebold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/details-of-kimveer-gill-s-apology-note-revealed-1.234024|title=Details of Kimveer Gill's apology note revealed|date=March 20, 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tumblr fandom gained widespread media attention in February 2015 after three of its members [[Halifax mass shooting plot|conspired to commit a mass shooting at a Halifax mall]] on [[Valentine's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/02/17/halifax-shooting-plot-columbiners_n_6696498.html |title=Halifax Shooting Plot: Who Are the "Columbiners?" |date=February 17, 2015 |website=Huffington Post Canada |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Company |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208062552/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/02/17/halifax-shooting-plot-columbiners_n_6696498.html |archive-date=December 8, 2015 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, two 15-year-old school boys from [[Northallerton]], [[UK]] were charged with conspiracy to murder after becoming infatuated with the crime and "hero-worshipping" Harris and Klebold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-43990090|title=Teens 'plotted Columbine-style attack'|date=2018-05-03|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702203929/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-43990090|archive-date=July 2, 2018|dead-url=no|language=en-GB|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====General studies====
Ralph Larkin wrote the Columbine massacre established a script for school shootings. Larkin examined twelve major school shootings in the US in the following eight years and found that in eight of those, "the shooters made explicit reference to Harris and Klebold."&lt;ref name=yorker&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/thresholds-of-violence|title=Thresholds of Violence, How school shootings catch on|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|date=October 19, 2015|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327011302/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/thresholds-of-violence|archive-date=March 27, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larkin wrote "Numerous post-Columbine rampage shooters referred directly to Columbine as their inspiration; others attempted to supersede the Columbine shootings in body count."&lt;ref name=larkin2009 /&gt;

In 2012, sociologist Nathalie E. Paton of the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|National Center for Scientific Research]] in [[Paris]] analyzed the videos created by post-Columbine school shooting perpetrators. A recurring set of motifs was found, including explicit statements of admiration and identification with previous perpetrators. Paton said the videos serve the perpetrators by distinguishing themselves from their classmates and associating themselves with the previous perpetrators.&lt;ref name=yorker /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=School shootings: Mediatized violence in a global age|last=Paton|first=Nathalie E.|publisher=[[Emerald Group Publishing]]|year=2012|isbn=9781780529196|editor-last1=Muschert|editor-first1=Glenn W.|volume=7|pages=203–229|chapter=Media participation of school shooters and their fans: Navigating between self-distinction and imitation to achieve individuation|accessdate=April 2, 2017|editor-last2=Sumiala|editor-first2=Johanna|chapter-url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/835850/filename/Paton-Media_Participation_of_School_Shooters_and_their_Fans.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 investigation by [[ABC News]] identified "at least 17 attacks and another 36 alleged plots or serious threats against schools since the assault on Columbine High School that can be tied to the 1999 massacre." Ties identified by ABC News included online research by the perpetrators into the Columbine shooting, clipping news coverage and images of Columbine, explicit statements of admiration of Harris and Klebold, such as writings in journals and on social media, in video posts, and in police interviews, timing planned to an anniversary of Columbine, plans to exceed the Columbine victim counts, and other ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/columbine-shootings-grim-legacy-50-school-attacks-plots/story?id=26007119|title=Columbine Shootings' Grim Legacy: More Than 50 School Attacks, Plots|last1=Thomas|first1=Pierre|date=October 7, 2014|accessdate=April 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417084412/http://abcnews.go.com/US/columbine-shootings-grim-legacy-50-school-attacks-plots/story?id=26007119|archive-date=April 17, 2017|dead-url=no|publisher=[[ABC News]]|last2=Levine|first2=Mike|last3=Cloherty|first3=Jack|last4=Date|first4=Jack|author-link1=Pierre Thomas (journalist)|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 investigation by [[CNN]] identified "more than 40 people...charged with Columbine-style plots." According to psychiatrist [[E. Fuller Torrey]] of the [[Treatment Advocacy Center]], a legacy of the Columbine shootings is its "allure to disaffected youth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/03/us/minnesota-foiled-school-massacre-john-ladue/index.html|title=The massacre that didn't happen|last=Drash|first=Wayne|date=November 3, 2015|accessdate=April 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402011921/http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/03/us/minnesota-foiled-school-massacre-john-ladue/index.html|archive-date=April 2, 2017|dead-url=no|publisher=[[CNN]]|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, journalist [[Malcolm Gladwell]] writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine proposed a [[threshold model]] of school shootings in which Harris and Klebold were the triggering actors in "a slow-motion, ever-evolving riot, in which each new participant's action makes sense in reaction to and in combination with those who came before."&lt;ref name=yorker /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/malcolm-gladwell-says-school-shootings-are-slow-moving-riots-2015-10|title=Malcolm Gladwell says the school shooting epidemic is like a slow-moving riot|last=Weller|first=Chris|date=October 13, 2015|accessdate=April 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418081232/http://www.businessinsider.com/malcolm-gladwell-says-school-shootings-are-slow-moving-riots-2015-10|archive-date=April 18, 2017|dead-url=no|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various '''consumer [[brain-computer interface]]s''' available for sale. These are devices that generally use an [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) headset to pick up EEG signals, a processor that cleans up and amplifies the signals, and converts them into desired signals, and some kind of output device.&lt;ref name=Pogue2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogue|first1=David|title=6 Electronic Devices You Can Control with Your Thoughts|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pogue-6-electronic-devices-you-can-control-with-your-thoughts/|work=Scientific American|date=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

As of 2012, EEG headsets ranged from simple dry single-contact devices to more elaborate 16-contact, wetted contacts, and output devices included toys like a tube containing a fan that blows harder or softer depending on how hard the user concentrates which in turn moved a ping-pong ball, video games, or a video display of the EEG signal.&lt;ref name=Pogue2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kent|first1=James|title=Porting Digital Memory - h+ Media|url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2010/05/25/porting-digital-memory/|work=h+ Media|date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies developing products in the space have taken different approaches.

[[Neurosky]] grew out of work in  an academic lab in Korea in the early 2000s; the team used an EEG headset to control the speed of a remote-controlled car and their device also used [[Eye tracking]] to control the direction the car moved.&lt;ref name=Geuth2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Genuth|first1=Iddo|title=Brain computer interfaces bring neuroscience to the masses|url=https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2015/05/brain-computer-interfaces-bring-neuroscience-to-the-masses/|work=E&amp;T magazine|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scientists initially intended to establish a company that would develop and sell toys, but when the company was founded in Silicon Valley, it focused mostly on providing devices and software to other companies as an [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]].&lt;ref name=Geuth2015/&gt;  In 2010 the company released a product called Mindwave with one contact, a processor, an application (and a mobile app) that could display the EEG signal, and several games and other apps; the included an [[API]] so developers could create new apps using the data.&lt;ref name=Geuth2015/&gt;

In 2007 the Canadian scientist [[Ariel Garten]] formed InteraXon with Trevor Coleman and Chris Aimone to commercialize her research on brain-computer interfaces, with an initial focus on output devices that could do practical tasks like turn off lights, control audio devices, or move objects.&lt;ref name=Geuth2015/&gt; The company released a headset and processor called Muse with seven electrodes, with an app and an API.&lt;ref name=Geuth2015/&gt;

In the 2010s French scientists Yohan Attal and Thibaud Dumas founded myBrain to commercialize their research, and worked with the Brain and Spine Institute (ICM) in Paris to create an EEG headset called melomind with four electrodes, with an app for stress management.&lt;ref name=Geuth2015/&gt;

Around the same time [[OpenBCI]] was founded by Joel Murphy to create an open source set of devices, processors, and software aimed at [[Do-it-yourself biology|biohackers]] and researchers that incorporates other sensors along with EEG electrodes.&lt;ref name=Geuth2015/&gt;

'''Critical terrorism studies''' ('''CTS''') applies a [[critical theory]] approach rooted in [[counter-hegemonic]] and politically progressive critical theory to the study of [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21"&gt;Jackson, R., Jarvis, L., Gunning, J., &amp; Breen-Smyth, M. (2011). Terrorism: A critical introduction. London, UK: Palgrave Macmillian&lt;/ref&gt; With links to the [[Frankfurt School]] of critical theory and the [[Aberystwyth School]] of critical security studies, CTS seeks to understand terrorism as a [[social construction]], or a label, that is applied to certain violent acts through a range of political, legal and academic processes.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; It also seeks to understand and critique dominant forms of counter-terrorism.

== Description ==

Following the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]]; there has been a massive increase in research related to terrorism. Terrorism has become one of the most powerful signifiers in contemporary society with the term generating vast amounts of social and political activity.  It has also become a cultural taboo which invokes emotions – fear and hatred.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35"&gt;Smyth, M.B., Gunning, J., Jackson, R. Kassimeris, G. &amp; Robinson, P. (2008). "Critical terrorism studies – an introduction". ''Critical Studies on Terrorism'', 1(1), 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS takes issue with previous terrorism studies in what it perceives as having methodological and analytical weaknesses, including a reliance on poor research methods and procedures, an overreliance on secondary resources, and a failure to undertake primary research; a failure to come up with an accepted definition of terrorism, and an inability to be cross-disciplinary. According to Jeroen Gunning: "core epistemological, methodological and political-normative problems persist, ranging from lack of conceptual clarity and theoretical sterility to political bias and a continuing dearth of primary research data".&lt;ref name="Gunning. A Case for 12"&gt;Gunning, J. (2007a). A case for critical terrorism studies? Government and opposition, 42(3), pp. 363-393.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS is a response to these research problems. With its origins in the Frankfurt School of critical theory, and the Welsh School of critical security studies (in which the primary referent to be secured is individuals not states), CTS is a self-reflective, critical approach to the study of terrorism which challenges the ontological, epistemological and ideological commitments of mainstream terrorism scholars.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; CTS also looks to attract academics from other disciplines who are uncomfortable with the mainstream discourse around terrorism and looks to engage directly with those who are perceived as 'terrorists' and/or terrorist sympathisers.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;

CTS aims to approach terrorism studies from a critical angle, that is, to encourage and further the adoption of a more self-consciously critical approach to the study of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. Research Agenda 20"&gt;Jackson, R., Breen Smyth, M., &amp; Gunning, J. (Eds.).(2009). Critical terrorism studies: A new research agenda. Abingdon, UK: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; However CTS does not only criticise the state of terrorism studies, it also attempts to "suggest an alternative way of studying terrorism and a concrete research agenda for the future".&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; While critical approaches to the study of terrorism are not new,&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. Research Agenda 20"/&gt; previous efforts have often occurred outside of the terrorism studies field. Such as the critical approach that some anthropology scholars have taken. These alternative approaches have "had little cross-fertilization with the orthodox field and have largely failed to alter its practices, priorities, approaches, outputs and myths".&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; CTS seeks to engage directly with the orthodox field,&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; and question its normative assumptions. Prompted by the growing unease over the state of current terrorism research, and the relationship between much orthodox terrorism research and the institutions of state power, CTS sets out to "stimulate, encourage, and more clearly articulate the nascent but observable 'critical turn' that was starting to become visible within the broader terrorism studies field".&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. Research Agenda 20"/&gt;

CTS scholars argue that terrorism should be de-exceptionalised as a form of political violence, not singled out as a unique form of "evil" violence, but  should be treated as other forms of political violence are.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; CTS also encourages researchers to engage with terrorists as humans, and not form explanations of terrorists in an [[Other (philosophy)|'Othering']] sense.&lt;ref name="Gunning. A Case for 12"/&gt; Therefore; "Ultimately, a critical approach to terrorism suggests that more positive and progressive change is always possible and that we can break out of seemingly endless cycles of terrorist/counter-terrorist violence, if only we can begin to think, study, speak and act outside of the dominant terrorism paradigm."&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;

== History ==

CTS's antecedents lie with scholars such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Edward S. Herman|Edward Herman]], who published critical works relating to the state and terrorism from the late 1970s. One of the first major works that gave impetus to a CTS discourse was [[Joseba Zulaika]] and William Douglass's&lt;ref name=" Zulaika 43 "&gt;Zulaika, J., (2012). "Drones, Witches and other Flying Objects: the Force of Fantasy in US Counterterrorism". ''Critical Studies on Terrorism'', 5(1), 51-68&lt;/ref&gt; seminal work, ''Terror and Taboo: The Follies, Fables, and Faces of Terrorism''. This book was a critical appraisal of  many of the international community's commonly-held assumptions about terrorism. A further catalyst for CTS came from Richard Jackson's 2005 book, ''Writing the War on Terrorism''. Jackson called for scholars to resist the current terrorism studies discourse: "I believe we have an ethical duty to resist the discourse, to deconstruct it at every opportunity and continually to interrogate the exercise of power".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. (2005) Writing the War on Terror: Language, politics and counter-terrorism. Manchester University Press, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; The setting up of the Critical Studies on Terrorism Working Group (CSTWG) within the [[British International Studies Association]] (BISA) occurred in early 2006, while in October 2006, a conference was held entitled; 'Is it time for a critical terrorism studies?' This was followed by two journal articles that called for a critical appraisal of the current state of terrorism studies. Richard Jackson's "Introduction: The Case for Critical Terrorism Studies" and Jeroen Gunning's "A case for Critical Terrorism Studies". In his "A case for Critical Terrorism Studies", Gunning calls for a critical approach that will "encourage researchers to historicize and contextualize the conflict by looking at the evolution of violence, broader processes of [[radicalization]], the relationship between violent organizations and wider social movements, and the relationship between social movements and the state."&lt;ref name="Gunning. A Case for 12" /&gt;

The setting up of the journal ''Critical Studies in Terrorism'' occurred in early 2007. The idea behind launching the journal was "one small part of a much broader attempt to foster a more self-reflective, critical approach to the study of terrorism, and bring in those who study aspects of 'terrorism', but are uncomfortable with or hostile to the (perceived) [[Ontology|ontological]], [[Epistemology|epistemological]], and [[Ideology|ideological]] commitments of existing terrorism studies."&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; CTS has continued to expand as a sub-discipline of terrorism studies and there has been a growth of CTS programs in universities such as [[Aberystwyth University]], the [[University of Kent]] and the [[University of Manchester]]. Other courses also exist within peace studies and politics programmes in universities such as [[Otago University]], [[Durham University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Virginia Tech]], [[University of Florida]], and [[Queens University Belfast]]. A major milestone in CTS will be the ''Handbook of Critical Terrorism Studies'' due to be published by [[Routledge]] in 2015.

== Ontological and epistemological foundations ==

===Two ontological critical theories===
* Critical realism: Observer and observed, or subject and object, are distinctly separate (For a clear alternative discussion on critical realism and CTS, see: Stump and Dixit 2013, 2011). 
* [[Reflectivism]]: Observer and observed or subject and object are deeply interconnected (For a more reflective discourse see: Jackson, Javis, Gunning, Smyth 2009&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;).
There has been a huge amount of academic discussion about the [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] foundations of critical terrorism studies. Within CTS, there is a broad agreement on the need to examine terrorism and terrorists from a historical, contextualized perspective asking 'how' questions of causation and constitution, rather than the more orthodox problem solving questions of a single isolated event. For instance, CTS questions why a terrorist action happens, asking whether the terrorists simply hate western notions of freedom, or whether they have deeper underlying political motivations?  CTS adopts the ontological position that "terrorism" is fundamentally a social fact rather than brute fact.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;

===Epistemological perspective===
* Critical realism: best approximation to objective world.
* [[Reflexivism]]: tool for inducing self-reflection of individuals and groups. Not static and monolithic.
CTS adopts the epistemological position that the nature of knowledge in terrorism studies is a social process which relies on contextual factors, including the influence of the researcher. CTS scholars argue that by being continuously aware of context, social processes, and the 'known' and 'unknown' knowledge in circulation, you can gain further insights into the study of terrorism. CTS also acknowledges the link between power and knowledge, and who research is ultimately for.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt;

===Overview of research areas===
* With the focus on epistemological understanding, it is now possible to question how we receive knowledge and who it benefits and why. 
* Examining the constructed information flow produced through academic research, basic education, political rhetoric, state and international law, and media. Reframing the discourse through a reflexive epistemology. 
* Human security over state security/national security. Move away from state-centric policies on security, to focusing on people and liberty.
* [[Emancipation]]: whose voice is marginalized or silenced, whose voice is empowered in defining terrorism, and what should the response to it be in particular contexts?&lt;ref name="McDonald 25"&gt;McDonald, M., 2007. Emancipation and critical terrorism studies. European Political Science, 6 (3), 252–259.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gender: the misconception that typically women are seen as victims of political violence and men as perpetrators.
* Gendering serves to maintain gender hierarchy and reinforces essentialist stereotypes of women as peaceful and powerless.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; Reframing women's interaction with terrorism and violence.
* Study of political terror (violence), state terrorism, structural violence and cultural violence.
* Exploring the extent to which the status quo contributes to the problem of terrorism.    "Whom defines terrorism?  Whom defines terrorist? Whom defines the dominant response?".&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; 
* [[State terrorism]] and [[counter-terrorism]]: creating the conditions of oppositional violence. To analyse the way traditional terrorism discourse is used to discredit oppositional groups and justify state policies. The applying of historical materialist approaches to systematic research of state terrorism has started to be critically assessed by [[Michael Stohl]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Richard Jackson (sociologist)|Richard Jackson]], [[Ruth Blakeley]] and others.

== Major differences from orthodox terrorism studies ==

CTS differs from [[:wikt:orthodox|orthodox]]/traditional terrorism studies (OTS) in several fundamental ways. Some of the most significant points of difference include its emphasis on the utilization of [[critical theory]] in research, its focus on removing the bias of [[ethnocentrism]] from all research, its goal to facilitate the spread of [[emancipation]] of peoples previously marginalized in traditional terrorism studies, and its attempt to avoid political bias and a problem-solving policy-orientation.

===Utilization of critical theory===
Scholars created CTS in response to what they felt was missing from traditional terrorism studies, namely, the critical aspect of research.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; Employing critical thinking in terrorism research can mean employing any one of several existing critical theories (such as [[Derrida]]'s [[deconstruction]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s [[post-structuralism]], or [[Louis Althusser|Althusser]]'s [[structuralism]], etc.) But, in a broader sense, it simply means researching and writing to challenge commonly held social, political, and personal beliefs about terrorism that often go unchallenged (specifically in traditional terrorism studies).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R., 2007a. "Symposium: Introduction: the case for critical terrorism studies". ''European Political Science'', 6 (3), 225–227.&lt;/ref&gt; OTS scholars agree that critical thinking and the utilization of critical theory should be a prominent aspect of any valuable research.&lt;ref&gt;Ranstorp, M., ed., 2006. ''Mapping terrorism research: state of the art, gaps and future directions''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rengger, N. and Thirkell-White, B., 2007. "Still critical after all these years? The past, present and future of critical theory in international relations". ''Review of International Studies'', 33, 3–24.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they also feel that such research already exists within the field of terrorism studies and that CTS is bringing more of a critical eye to the field, but that there is no cause for it to be a whole separate sub-field.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; However, unlike traditional terrorism studies, CTS is strict on its adherence to the critical element of research, as it believes critical analysis is one of the few ways to overcome the problematic gaps within traditional terrorism studies.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17"&gt;Jackson, R., 2007b. The core commitments of critical terrorism studies. European Political Science, 6 (3), 244–251.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS also hopes that the critical element will also eventually bridge the traditional and critical approaches, if both begin to follow the research procedures that allow critical analysis.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt;

===Removing ethnocentrism===
CTS attempts to combat what they feel is a prevalent state-centricity and [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentricity]] in traditional terrorism studies.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, J., 2006. Overblown: how politicians and the terrorism industry inflate national security threats and why we believe them. New York, NY: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent scholars Jackson, Gunning and Smyth claim that since most research on terrorism is done by [[state-sponsored]] scholars and experts, there is a disproportionate amount of research articulating states' perspectives and experiences (namely western state-actors), leaving almost all non-state actors without any fair, unbiased representation in the research field.&lt;ref name="Silke 33"&gt;Silke, A., ed., 2004. Research on terrorism: trends, achievements and failures. London: Frank Cass.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, CTS challenges state-centric or ethnocentric research by responding directly to already published research, finding holes and gaps in the arguments,&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; and by completing new research that challenges ethnocentric claims and provides new claims from the perspective of non-state entities, and specifically, the perspectives of the so-labeled 'terrorists' themselves.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; OTS scholars see this shift from so-called "[[state centrism]]" as obvious and not wholly necessary. Bias is unavoidable and viewing it as such has the possibility to weaken arguments already made.&lt;ref name="Silke 33" /&gt; Also, there is not a complete lack of ethnocentric-free research within terrorism studies and therefore CTS is seen as simply creating a bifurcation between the subfields.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Silke 33" /&gt; Despite this criticism, CTS remains determined to conduct research free from state-centric and ethnocentric perspectives, opening space for new perspectives and discourses that may have been overlooked by terrorism studies as a whole.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt;

===Facilitating the spread of emancipation===
When referring to the [[emancipation|emancipatory]] nature of research, CTS is referring not only to the emancipation of previously marginalized peoples' voices in the field of OTS, but the emancipation of ideas, questions and theories that have been marginalized, overlooked, or seen as non-issues in orthodox studies. A simple way to understand CTS's emancipation is to think of it as a process of creating space and discussion that allows the focus to be on experiences, ideas and questions which have been "neglected in most orthodox accounts of security and terrorism".&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; The emancipation of ideas, dialogue, and experience is a powerful "philosophical anchorage"&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; that allows CTS to separate itself and its motives from that of traditional and orthodox terrorism studies. Traditional terrorism studies theorists understand the value behind the idea of emancipatory nature of CTS's research, but many feel such a claim is overstated.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15"&gt;Horgan, J. &amp; Boyle, M. J., (2008). A case against 'Critical Terrorism Studies', Critical Studies on Terrorism, 1:1, 51-64, DOI: 10.1080/17539150701848225.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS's claim of emancipation is seen as simply reinventing the wheel, a wheel that has been working effectively for orthodox scholars for decades. And the claim&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; to be the first in a field as politically charged and somewhat emotionally delicate as terrorism studies to ask hard questions and challenge commonly held beliefs and assumptions is seen as a gross over-simplification and generalization that risks replacing one dominant discourse with another, and in turn,  marginalizing the research and voices of traditional terrorism studies.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, J., 2007. The rise and rise of terrorism studies. The Guardian, 3 July.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite traditional terrorism studies' negative response to CTS's emancipatory claim, CTS still strives to keep emancipation as one of its core motivations for continued research.&lt;ref name="McDonald 25" /&gt; Emancipatory research in terrorism studies can bring to light overlooked perspectives such as the war in Iraq being a form of occupation bringing more violence than peace,&lt;ref&gt;Fontan, V., 2006. Polarization between occupier and occupied in post-Saddam Iraq: humiliation and the formation of political violence. Terrorism and Political Violence, 18, 217–238.&lt;/ref&gt; the idea that State sponsored research is often biased and unreliable&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt; and that any and all valuable research should be conducted free of political bias to truly increase understanding.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt; These few listed ideas are examples of what CTS hopes to bring to the field of terrorism studies through emancipatory research.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;

===Freedom from policy===
One of the largest voids of orthodox terrorism studies CTS aims to fill is the void of politically neutral and policy-free research and ideas.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; Post-9/11, almost all research on terrorism has been sponsored and conducted by [[state-actors]], many standing to gain politically from the conclusions drawn from such research.&lt;ref name="Symth et al. CTS an Intro 35" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnett 5"&gt;Burnett, J. &amp; Whyte, D. (2005). Embedded expertise and the new terrorism. Journal for Crime, Conflict and the Media, 1(4), 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; CTS feels that the prominent discourse maintained by State-sponsored terrorism research contributes to the justification of [[state terrorism]] and de-legitimizes any argument that would challenge or condemn such actions.&lt;ref name="Sluka 34"&gt;Sluka, J., 2000. "Introduction: State terror and anthropology" in J. Sluka, ed. ''Death squad: The anthropology of state terror''. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when research is sponsored for political reasons, the 'experts' become not those who have the most relevant experience, but those who are willing to support whatever political view that will result in more funding, and those who are willing to adhere to any current policy around terrorism (e.g. "Our country does not negotiate with terrorists" therefore all research reflects the impossibility of negotiating with terrorist).&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, C., 2006. In the name of terrorism: presidents on political violence in the post-World War II era. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox terrorism studies researchers see the idea of political and policy neutral research as a nice sentiment, but impossible to execute.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt; Many have criticized CTS for claiming policy free and politically neutral research, as even the word terrorism itself is not free of any political meaning and connotation.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt; And since many scholars study and research the causes, effects, and nature of terrorism because of passionate ideas and interests, it would be irresponsible to assert that simply because a piece of research is free of state centricism and bias that it is automatically politically neutral.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; Again, traditional terrorism studies sees CTS's research attempts as oversimplifications to claim innovation in an already established field.

However, CTS sees the criticism from orthodox scholars as extenuating the need for there to be more than one avenue of academic discourse available.&lt;ref name="Jackson 17" /&gt; By aiming to keep all research politically neutral and policy free, a space opens up for experts with non-state experience to enter a field which was previously unavailable to them.&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; And again, politically neutral scholars are more able to bring to attention and help fight acts of state terrorism that are often overlooked and even justified in orthodox studies.&lt;ref name="Sluka 34" /&gt;

===Traditional terrorism studies' response===
CTS's new approach and perspective has been widely welcomed in the field of terrorism studies. Nevertheless, it has  been subject to criticism for its desire to distinguish itself from what it deems "traditional" or "orthodox" terrorism studies, and for its claim of maintaining absolute political neutrality. However, scholars both from critical and traditional terrorism studies remain determined not to allow any distinction between the subfields to cause bifurcation and incompatibility within the field of research itself.&lt;ref name="Horgan 15" /&gt;

== CTS's main critiques of traditional terrorism studies ==

CTS would not have come into existence unless scholars saw the need for a change in many of the perspectives within terrorism studies as a whole.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; Some of the most common criticisms CTS consistently presents including the inconsistent 'definition' of terrorism, the political power held by most Orthodox scholars, the ineffectiveness of the War on Terror, the glorification of patriotism, and the demonising narrative of the 'enemy'.

===Definitions of terrorism===
The term "terrorism" gained prominence during the [[French Revolution]] when it was used by the Jacobins to kill known supporters of the [[Ancien Régime]], and to eliminate those labeled enemies of the revolution.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40"&gt;Wilkinson, P. (2012). "The Utility of the Concept of Terrorism" in R. Jackson and S. J. Sinclair (eds.), ''Contemporary Debates on Terrorism'', Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the state was the first proponent of using terrorism as a political tool.&lt;ref&gt;Stohl, M. (2008). Old myths, new fantasies and the enduring realities of terrorism, Critical Studies on Terrorism, 1:1, 5-16, DOI: 10.1080/17539150701846443.&lt;/ref&gt; Moving into the twentieth century, the regimes of [[Nazi Germany]] and Soviet Russia, through the use of secret police, used tension to subdue and kill those deemed enemies of the state. Further, a number of Latin American states backed by the US utilised state-terrorism to silence the population and consolidate their control – Chile and Nicaragua in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Pilger, J. (1994). ''Distant Voices'' (rev. ed.). London: Vintage.&lt;/ref&gt;  Up until this point, terrorism was largely, though not exclusively, defined by its use by state. And it was not until later that academic circles shifted the focus to non-state actors.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt; There is research to suggest that states that have witnessed severe upheaval throughout their history will utilise state-terrorism. Such as Iraq, Syria, Israel, Burundi, Rwanda, Zaire, Myanmar, Indonesia, Serbia and Chechnya.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt; Furthermore, for weak states, state terrorism is often viewed as a legitimate total state consolidation.

Terrorism therefore has a number of meanings and interpretations that we can use to assess terrorist acts in the contemporary era. Terrorism is a heavily contested concept and it is the context in which a violent act occurs as to how people define the act. It is symbolic violence, a communicative act, with the sole purpose to send the message. It is the psychological effect of using fear, as it is not the victims of a terrorist act. But the wider audience who are the target, because the victims become instrumental as they are the message carriers.

* Generic terrorism: "The systematic use of violence and intimidation to coerce a government or community, into acceding to specific political demands."&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, J., and Trumble, B., eds, (2006). Oxford Referencing Dictionary, 2nd ed., revised, Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the use of or the threat of violence that is meant to intimidate a wider target than the immediate victims of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt;
* Non-state terrorism: Involves attacks on civilians, symbolic and random targets and is usually, though not exclusively, aimed at bringing about political change.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt;
* [[Religious terrorism]]: Political violence in the name of religion by religiously motivated people. A problematic term that is used to categorise terrorism and differentiate it from other forms of terrorism, by assuming there is a casual relationship between religion and violence, rather than looking at the study of beliefs and practices in the production of political violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gunning, J., and Jackson, R. (2011). "What's so 'religious' about 'religious terrorism'?", ''Critical Studies on Terrorism'', 4:3, 369-388, DOI: 10.1080/17539153.2011.623405.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[State terrorism]]: Involves the intimidation of the civilian population into submission. This occurs when a third-party is used to silence dissidents, and kill people, instilling fear in the population.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 40" /&gt;

===Links to power===
A CTS critique of OTS revolves around many OTS scholars' links to institutions of power. CTS questions these links to [[hegemonic]] actors and structures from the [[global North]] that can be seen to be furthering the agendas of certain states, because OTS is a discipline that is primarily concerned with looking at acts of terrorism by non-state actors. This is a very state-centric perspective which has a limited set of assumptions and narratives about the nature and cause of terrorism. Moreover, this becomes accepted as the general consensus at the macro, meso and micro levels of government and institutions, and is reflected in policy and the way the mainstream view terrorism. Traditional terrorism studies is also largely concerned with "problem solving theory", which looks at the world "with the prevailing social and power relationships and the institutions into which they are organised, as the given framework for action", and then works to "make these relationships and institutions work smoothly by dealing effectively with particular sources of trouble".&lt;ref&gt;Cox, R. (1981). Social forces, states and world orders: Beyond international relations theory. Millennium: Journal of International Studies, 10(2), 126-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they look at dealing with the issue of terrorism within the current dominant structures of power. An example of this is the scholars and associated research that is affiliated with the [[RAND Corporation]]. Now an independent think tank, RAND was established by the US air force in 1945, and was contracted to the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. It has maintained close links with US administrations, and former board members include [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and [[Condoleezza Rice]], both leading members of the [[George W. Bush]] administration.&lt;ref name="Blakeley 4"&gt;Blakeley, R. (2009). ''State Terrorism and Neoliberalism: The north in the south''. London, UK: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The major problem with this association with government is that it privileges research on threats by non-state actors, and marginalises research around state sponsorship of terrorism. According to Burnett and Whyte, the Corporation acts "effectively as an influential prestigious voice in the American military-industrial lobby and in world politics; particularly with regard to its interventions on the war on terror". Scholars, or "embedded experts"&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; associated with RAND have key editorial positions in the two most prominent English-language terrorism journals, ''Terrorism and Political Violence'' and ''Conflict and Terrorism''. RAND scholars helped to found the [[St Andrew Centre for Studies in Terrorism and Political Violence (CSTPV)]], the leading centre for the study of terrorism in the UK.&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt; As well, experts associated with the RAND-St Andrews nexus have significant professional ties with businesses and military personal associated with counter-terrorism activity, many of which have made "windfall profits" in the Iraq conflict.&lt;ref name="Burnett 5" /&gt;

== The War on Terror ==

On [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks | 19 terrorists]]&lt;ref name="Pape 27"&gt;Pape. R. (2005) ''Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism''. New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– in association with [[Al-Qaeda]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks|hijacked four commercial planes and flew them]] into the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)| World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], [[The Pentagon]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], and a field near [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania]]. The number of deaths is estimated at 2996 casualties.&lt;ref name="http 49"&gt;http://owni.eu/2011/05/05/the-war-on-terror-in-numbers/&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days, President [[George W. Bush]] declared a [[War on Terror]] to prevent any more terrorist attacks on the Western world. Bush immediately framed these terrorists as being motivated by [[Islamic extremism]]; an evil, destructive and repressive people who America refused to negotiate with and must defeat (45). The estimates of how many thousands of civilians, insurgents, soldiers (both American and otherwise) and Islamists that have been killed in the war on terror vary widely from 220,000&lt;ref name="http 49" /&gt; to 650,000.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; However these statistics are unreliable due to their varied date, source and amount – it is not possible to know how many people have been victims of the war on terror. Not only has this war killed, tortured and displaced hundreds of thousands of people, there is no proof that it has been effective in reducing terrorism, and has led to a further proliferation of terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name="Lum 24"&gt;Lum, C., Kennedy, L. W., &amp; Sherley, A. (2006).  Are counter-terrorism strategies effective?&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bush Doctrine===
{{main article|The Bush Doctrine}}
The rationality behind Bush's decision to start a war on terrorism comes in four parts. First it was implemented as a preventive war, and as an excuse to act pre-emptively. Second, it was based on unilateralism, although where necessary, Bush attempted to enlist support from the international community. Third, there was an element of idealism that believed that war would help to spread democracy, human rights and liberties. And lastly, Bush endeavoured to maintain American hegemony by reaffirming the vital role of American military strength.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; It is argued that the negative effects of this war will be felt for generations, due to the culture of division, stereotyping and hate between the Middle East and the West. The formation of a new "suspect community" in the Middle East has undermined human rights and civil liberties, and impaired the functionality of the international system.&lt;ref name="Jackson et al. A Critical Intro 21" /&gt; [[Just war theory]] stands as the main justification for the war on terror. This means that new technologies and methods in war are legalized. The [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] is viewed by many CTS scholars as an act of terror.&lt;ref name="Keen 23"&gt;Keen, D. (2006). War without end? Magic, Propaganda and the hidden functions of counter-terror. Journal of International Development, 18(1), p. 87-104&lt;/ref&gt; Terror on terror makes no sense,&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; and did not produce positive results. The attack on Iraq  was illogical considering America's past partnership with Iraq, the whereabouts of [[Al-Qaeda]]'s base and [[Osama bin Laden]] in Afghanistan, and also the men who attacked the twin towers were from Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="Pape 27" /&gt;  American power internationally meant that they authorized the attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan, and also drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. While Bush legitimises the enemy by asserting that terrorists want to 'kill all Americans',&lt;ref name="https 45"&gt;ConspiracyWorld (September 3, 2010). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CSPbzitPL8 "Sept. 20, 2001 - Bush Declares War on Terror"]. ''[[YouTube]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no discernable difference between this falsified aim and the goal of American Military intervention in the Middle East. [[Barack Obama]] has continued the Bush-instigated War on Terror by plainly stating that the biggest threat to America is still terrorism.&lt;ref name="http 48"&gt;http://america.aljazeera.com/blogs/scrutineer/2014/5/29/obama-west-pointspeech.html&lt;/ref&gt;  So, despite the reduction of military occupation in the Middle East, the trace of War on Terror still remains.&lt;ref name="http 48" /&gt;

===Counter-insurgency failures===
The overall ineffective and illegitimate result of the war on terror means that the costs have thus far outweighed the successes. [[Counter-terrorism]] efforts such as [[Targeted killing]] and [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drone strikes]] have backfired and are not proven to work, and have even perpetuated the number of terrorist attacks, including [[Suicide attacks|suicide bombings]].&lt;ref name="Lum 24" /&gt; While counter-terrorism may deter some attacks, it cannot prevent all, and often has the result of provoking rather than reducing terrorism. The [[Iraq War]] was not productive in countering terrorism.&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; Upward of 60 examples of terrorist incidents in America are proven consequences of United States foreign policy and military intervention.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/fpb50.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Still, no academic scholar in orthodox terrorism studies has considered American military intervention as the primary problem.&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; It is noted that at [[Faisal Shahzad]]'s trial – following his failed [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]] – he cited the drones that were killing the people of his community as the reason for his vengeance.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Unmanned drone attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan tend to target public places and gatherings, such as weddings and funerals, and are increasing the threat of terrorism. Violence emanates and results from counterinsurgency/terrorism. What America calls preventative war, the Middle East calls state terrorism.&lt;ref name="Aretxaga 1"&gt;Aretxaga, B. (2001). "Terror as a thrill: First thoughts on the 'war on terrorism'." ''Anthropological Quarterly'', 75(1), p.138–150&lt;/ref&gt;

===The War on Terror and patriotism===
Throughout American history, military strength has been at the heart of identity; it is embedded in politics and culture. War as a solution is rooted in American culture, as [[The War of Independence]] and [[World War Two|World War II]] are referred to as successes and justifications for future war.&lt;ref name="Keen 23" /&gt; Rather than concentrating resources and money on problems that have widespread negative effects on American society, like poverty, education, health or the environment, the United States has spent US$1.283 trillion since 9/11 on military interventions internationally.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/rl33110.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotype of the enemy is perpetuated and normalized through American culture, media, entertainment and politics. And the shared hate for the enemy contributes to a unified patriotism within America that deflects attention from the deeply entrenched inequalities within the nation.&lt;ref name="Aretxaga 1" /&gt; The war on terror acts as a distraction mechanism from local problems in the Western world, and maintains a war culture of its own that produces justifications and legitimate rationality for prolonging the war in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Bayoumi, M. (2008). Endless War? Hidden Functions of the 'War on Terror' by David Keen. Development and Change. 39(5), p.870-871.&lt;/ref&gt; The patriotism that the war on terror creates contributes to large sources of revenue for the American military industrial economy through [[mass surveillance]], weapon suppliers, the [[CIA]], military personnel and orthodox terrorism academics.&lt;ref&gt;Zalman, A., &amp; Clarke, J. (2009). The Global War on Terror: A Narrative in Need of a Rewrite. Ethics &amp; International Affairs, 23(2), p.101-113,89-90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating a narrative of the enemy===
The culture of war is created through the imagery and language used in politics and popular entertainment in order to frame a narrative of the enemy. [[Islam]] and [[Muslims]] have been constructed as a dangerous other in Western culture. Not only do politicians&amp;nbsp;– especially in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]&amp;nbsp;– inform the public of this enemy, this fictional reality is reinforced through journalism and entertainment in which the war is framed as inevitable and the enemy as evil.&lt;ref name="Aretxaga 1" /&gt; This all reinforces the fantasy that this war is about fighting evil in general, and the Western soldiers that are killed are fighting for a greater good. The hyperbolic, dramatic language used in the media casts the Western world as heroes who fight the villains. CTS reflects on who this narrative of the enemy benefits. This perception that reinforces patriotism and justifications for war, profits the Western world and furthers the dominance and oppression that divides the two regions.
When the motives and ideology of terrorists are largely unknown – let alone the number and whereabouts – the greater the possibility is to rely on stereotype and myth-based discourse.&lt;ref name="http 44"&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-brenner/terror-americas-archetype_b_5784166.html?ir=WorldPost&lt;/ref&gt; Because the enemy is foreign (even alien) this possibility is increased due to limited knowledge and physical connection to the region. When reality falls short, the narrative of foreign peoples is shaped by "shortcuts provided by stylized imagery compounded of stories, films and our own imaginations".&lt;ref name="http 44" /&gt; Politicians use this to back up their dehumanized claims, so the image of the terrorist mimics [[Osama bin Laden]] with the beard, turban, black eyes and hollow glum face creating a stereotyped stigma. This enemy is merciless, believes in extreme religious values and will do anything to destroy the West. Such imagery and language degrades common humanity, and prevents us from understanding that the enemy is a human who is victimized.

===Terrorism and mobilities===
[[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]] was a pioneer in discussing the paradigms of mobilities within the age of terror. Per his viewpoint, terrorism operates in a world of contrasting complexities where the power, far from being static, flows. The power is mobile in the same way, its gravity-effects on the world of consumption. Terrorism divides the world in two safe and unsafe zones.&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. (2002). The global complexities of September 11th. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, 19(4), 57-69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. (2005). The complexities of the global. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, 22(5), 235-254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. (2005). The complexity turn. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, 22(5), 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Over past decades, many voices alerted on the negative effects of terrorism over the industry of tourism and mobilities in developed and underdeveloped economies.&lt;ref&gt;Sönmez, S. F., Apostolopoulos, Y., &amp; Tarlow, P. (1999). Tourism in crisis: Managing the effects of terrorism. Journal of Travel Research, 38(1), 13-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergent theories explained terrorism as an indicator of the lack of democracy, or even extreme poverty which represents a fertile ground for ethnic resentment necessary to rechannel terrorism. Since tourists are ambassadors of first World, not surprisingly they were targets of terrorist cells in zones dotted with lower levels of security.&lt;ref&gt;Pizam, A., &amp; Smith, G. (2000). Tourism and terrorism: A quantitative analysis of major terrorist acts and their impact on tourism destinations. Tourism Economics, 6(2), 123-138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mansfeld, Y., &amp; Pizam, A. (Eds.). (2006). Tourism, security and safety. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enders, W., Sandler, T., &amp; Parise, G. F. (1992). An econometric analysis of the impact of terrorism on tourism. Kyklos, 45(4), 531-554.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some other scholars questioned this idea considering that tourism recovers its attraction and growth after elapsed little time from the original event;&lt;ref&gt;Fleischer, A., &amp; Buccola, S. (2002). War, terror, and the tourism market in Israel. Applied Economics, 34(11), 1335-1343.&lt;/ref&gt; or even producing "traumaescape" which means zones whipped by terrorism that becomes tourist attractions.&lt;ref&gt;Bégin, R. (2014). Digital Traumascape From the Trümmerfilme to Wall e.

'''David Ernest McReynolds''' (October 25, 1929 – August 17, 2018) was an American politician and [[social activist]] who was a prominent [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] and [[pacifist]] [[activist]]. He described himself as "a peace movement bureaucrat" during his 40-year career with the [[War Resisters League]].&lt;ref&gt;David McReynolds, "Thinking About Retirement", ''Nonviolent Activist'', March–April 1999, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DubermanSavingRemnant&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Saving-Remnant-Radical-Barbara-McReynolds/dp/1595583238 Martin Duberman, ''A Saving Remnant: The Radical Lives of Barbara Deming and David McReynolds,'' New York: The New Press (2011)]{{rp|221}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a resident of New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=7993|title=Our Campaigns - Candidate - David McReynolds|website=www.ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; McReynolds was twice a candidate for [[President of the United States]], running atop the ticket of the [[Socialist Party USA]] in 1980 and 2000.

{{American socialism |expanded=People}}

==Early life==
McReynolds was born in Los Angeles, to Elizabeth Grace (Tallon), a nurse, and Lt. Col. Charles McReynolds, an Air Force intelligence officer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=7993&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 he joined the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA) and in 1953 he graduated from [[UCLA]] with a degree in [[political science]]. Between 1957 and 1960, he worked for the [[editorial board]] of the left-wing magazine ''[[Liberation (magazine)|Liberation]]''. He was [[openly gay]] and wrote his first article about living as a gay man in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Leaders from the 1960s: A Biographical Sourcebook of American Activism. Edited By David De Leon Published by Greenwood Publishing Group, 1994 {{ISBN|0-313-27414-2}} pp.215–219&lt;/ref&gt;

==War Resisters League==
McReynolds was staunchly [[anti-war]] and a [[Conscription#Draft resisters|draft resister]], and in 1960 joined the staff of the [[War Resisters League]] (WRL), where he remained until his retirement in 1999. In 1965 he lectured on 'The Old Left and the New Left' at the newly founded [[Free University of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = [[Joseph Berke|Berke]]| first = Joseph

On November 6, 1965, he was one of five men who publicly [[Draft-card burning|burned their draft cards]] at an [[Opposition to the Vietnam War#The draft|anti-war demonstration]] at Union Square in New York.  This was one of the first public draft-card burnings after U.S. law was changed on August 30, 1965 to make such actions a felony, punishable by up to five years' imprisonment. He was close friends with [[Bayard Rustin]]&lt;ref&gt;John D'Emilio. READING THE SILENCES IN A GAY LIFE The Case of Bayard Rustin pp. 59–68 in The Seductions of Biography. Edited: Mary Rhiel, David Suchoff, David Bruce Suchoff. Routledge, 1996 {{ISBN|0-415-91089-7}}&lt;br&gt;
"Rustin's only defender was Dave McReynolds, a younger gay staffer at the War Resisters League, whom Rustin had mentored over the years"&lt;/ref&gt; and other prominent peace activists, as well as literary figures such as [[Quentin Crisp]].&lt;ref&gt;Dave McReynolds. [http://www.crisperanto.org/memories/mcreynolds.html NOTES ON KNOWING QUENTIN]. and [http://www.crisperanto.org/memories/mcreynolds1.html QUENTIN CRISP: THE RADICAL], Quentin Crisp Archives (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, he signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

McReynolds was particularly active internationally, both in [[War Resisters' International]] of which he was chairperson for the term 1986–88, and in the International Confederation for Disarmament and Peace which eventually merged into the [[International Peace Bureau]].

==Socialist Party USA==
The SPA was renamed the [[Social Democrats USA]] by a majority vote at the 1972 convention. [[Michael Harrington]] resigned and then formed the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (now the [[Democratic Socialists of America]], DSA) with the purpose of "realignment" strengthening the role of labor unions and other progressive organizations in the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] to pull it to the left.  The smallest and the most left wing of the SPA, known as the [[Debs Caucus]], including McReynolds, formed the [[Socialist Party USA]] (SPUSA).  McReynolds was long a member of both DSA and SPUSA.

McReynolds' primary theoretical contribution to socialism came from his blending of a [[pacifist]] world-view with a commitment to re-distributive [[socialist economics]].  Politically, he was a staunch [[anti-authoritarian]] and collaborated with a diverse set of political formations on the democratic left.  His widely read pamphlet, ''The Philosophy of Nonviolence'', provides a unique window into the mind of a lifelong activist wrestling with the contradictions and pitfalls which plagued the political left in the 20th century.  He concludes that "...there is no living, vital philosophy which does not have 'holes' in it."  Consequently, he mapped out a [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralistic]] approach which is, on the one hand, socialist, yet is entirely engaged with thought systems as seemingly contradictory as [[Hindu philosophy]].  He concluded that a brand of pacifist-socialism is best suited for future socialist experiments since it offers the greatest opportunity to prefigure the kinds of democratic relations necessary to create a functional and free society.{{Clarify|date=September 2010}}

In his political career, McReynolds ran for [[United States Congress|Congress]] from [[Lower Manhattan]] twice and for [[President of the United States|President]] twice.  In 1958 he ran as a write-in SPA candidate and then in 1968 as a [[Peace and Freedom Party]] candidate for Congress in the 19th district pulling in 4.7% of the vote (3,969 votes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1968election.pdf |title=Statistics of the Presidential and Congressional Election of November 5, 1968 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, he ran for President of the United States as the SPUSA candidate, with [[Diane Drufenbrock]] as vice presidential candidate, receiving 6,994 votes (0.01%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1980&amp;off=0 |title=1980 Presidential General Election Results |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kari Lydersen. David vs. Goliath. In These Times. Vol. 24, No. 10 (2000). &lt;br&gt;
On his 1980 presidential run:
"He was among the first openly gay political candidates for any office, having come out in WIN magazine in 1969, and though he doesn't see himself as a "gay and lesbian candidate," he has continued to work for gay rights."&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the request of fellow Socialists, he ran again for President as the SPUSA candidate in 2000, with [[Mary Cal Hollis]] as his running mate, receiving 5,602 votes.  In both 1980 and 2000, McReynolds received the endorsement and ballot line of the [[Liberty Union Party]] in Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G00/VT.html#Pre |title=Vermont November 2000 General Election |publisher=Thegreenpapers.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2000 election, the ''Palm Beach Post'' speculated that 2,908 voters, "mostly in elderly Jewish districts", had mistakenly voted for both Al Gore, running for President on the Democratic ticket, and for McReynolds on a "confusing [[butterfly ballot]]", thereby resulting in voided votes, helping to cost Gore the state's crucial electoral votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/politics/content/news/election2000/election2000_overvote_gore.html |title=Joel Engelhardt and Scott McCabe, "Over-votes cost Gore the election in Florida," '&amp;#39;Palm Beach Post,'&amp;#39; undated website |publisher=Palmbeachpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616195335/http://www.palmbeachpost.com/politics/content/news/election2000/election2000_overvote_gore.html |archivedate=June 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/421793208 |title=Kevin Phillips, "The GOP's control of Congress and the White House can last only so long," '&amp;#39;Los Angeles Times,'&amp;#39; April 15, 2001, page M-1  |accessdate=2011-09-27}} {{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the [[Socialist Party USA]]'s National Committee voted to [[censure]] McReynolds over alleged racist comments made on social media regarding the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]] and [[shooting of Michael Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reinholz|first=Mary|title=Rift Among Socialists Over Former Presidential Hopeful’s ‘Potentially Racist’ Comments About Michael Brown|url=http://bedfordandbowery.com/2015/05/rift-among-socialists-over-former-presidential-hopefuls-potentially-racist-comments-about-michael-brown/|publisher=Bedford + Bowery|date=May 1, 2015|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from the SPUSA shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="thevillager.com"/&gt;

==2004 Senate campaign==
{{Main|United States Senate election in New York, 2004}}
On July 10, 2004, McReynolds announced his candidacy running on the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] ticket for one of the New York seats in the [[United States Senate elections, 2004|Senate]], running an anti-war campaign against Democratic incumbent [[Chuck Schumer]], where he pulled in 36,942 votes for 0.5% of total.&lt;ref name=DubermanSavingRemnant/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2006/general/2006_ussen.pdf |title=NYS Board of Elections US Senate Election Returns Nov. 7, 2006 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822221220/http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2006/general/2006_ussen.pdf |archivedate=August 22, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
McReynolds was active politically until just before his death, attending meetings; speaking in classrooms; being interviewed for films and research; and participating in peace/justice/antiwar/antinuclear actions. His last arrest was at the U.S. Mission to the U.N. in 2015 at an action calling for immediate nuclear disarmament, starting with the U.S. 

He was an avid photographer throughout his adult life and spent time during the last three years of his life sorting his collection of more than 50,000 photos. A photo website is linked under Works, below.

In 2015, McReynolds endorsed U.S. Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] for [[President of the United States]], praising him as a "serious candidate" and for not personally attacking his Democratic rival [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peoplesworld.org/article/why-i-support-bernie-sanders/|title=Why I support Bernie Sanders|publisher=Peoples World|date=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McReynolds died on August 17, 2018, aged 88, following a fall he sustained at his New York City home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-news-david-mcreynolds-dead-88-story.html|title=David McReynolds, longtime peace activist and agitator, dead at 88|publisher=New York Daily News|date=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Seymour''' (born '''Dawid Szymin''';&lt;ref name="thejc"&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-features/104539/chim-photographys-forgotten-hero Chim: Photography's forgotten hero]&lt;/ref&gt; November 20, 1911 – November 10, 1956), or '''Chim''' (pronounced ''shim'', an abbreviation of the surname "Szymin"), was a Polish [[Photography|photographer]] and [[photojournalism|photojournalist]].

Chim was known for his images from the [[Spanish Civil War]], for co-founding [[Magnum Photos]] with [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], [[Robert Capa]] and [[George Rodger]],&lt;ref name="mag_hist"&gt;[https://pro.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAX_2&amp;FRM=Frame:MAX_3#/CMS3&amp;VF=MAX_2&amp;FRM=Frame:MAX_5: History of Magnum]&lt;/ref&gt; and for his project "Children of War" with [[UNICEF]] that captured the plight of children in the aftermath of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="child_war"&gt;[https://www.unicef.org/emergencies/index_69785.html: UNICEF's first international photographer]&lt;/ref&gt;

He became president of Magnum after Capa's death in 1954 and held this post until his own death in 1956 by Egyptian machinegun fire in the aftermath of the [[Suez crisis]].&lt;ref name="chim_death"&gt;[https://www.magnumphotos.com/theory-and-practice/david-seymour-life-worth-living/: David Seymour: A Life Worth Living]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Chim was born to Polish Jewish parents in [[Warsaw]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="thejc"/&gt; David had a sister, Eileen, who was three years older. Their parents were Regina and Benjamin Szymin, a respected publisher of Yiddish and Hebrew books.&lt;ref name="museum.icp.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.icp.org/museum/collections/special/chim/chim2.html|title=Chim |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315180604/http://museum.icp.org/museum/collections/special/chim/chim2.html |archivedate=2013-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1914 Chim and his parents emigrated to Odessa just as [[World War I]] had begun. In 1919 they returned to Warsaw. Chim studied graphic arts in [[Leipzig]] and then traveled to [[Paris]] to study at the [[Sorbonne]].&lt;ref name=ngabio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/chim/bio.shtm|title=Biography|work=Chim: David Seymour's Humanist Photography|publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]]|accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:David Seymour, A Disturbed Child in a Warsaw Orphanage, 1948.jpg|thumbnail|right|A Disturbed Child in a Warsaw Orphanage, 1948, by Chim. Identified as Teresa Adwentowska, per Tel Aviv University exhibit]]
It was while Chim was studying at the [[Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]] that he became interested in photography. He began working as a freelance journalist in 1933. His first "credited" published photograph appeared in 1934 in the magazine ''[[Regards]].''

Between 1936 and 1938 Chim covered the [[Spanish Civil War]] (alongside colleague [[Robert Capa]]) and other international political events. In February 1935 Chim was sent to Spain by ''Regards'' to report on crucial issues there. Twenty five of his stories on Spain ended up being published in ''Regards.''&lt;ref name="museum.icp.org"/&gt;

In 1939 he covered the Loyalist Spanish war refugees on the S.S. Sinaia to Mexico and then later in the year he arrived in the United States. Chim was in New York City when [[World War II]] broke out in Europe when Nazi Germany invaded Poland, Chim's birthplace.&lt;ref name="museum.icp.org"/&gt;  In 1940 he enlisted in the United States Army, serving in Europe as a photo interpreter during the war. In 1942 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States, the same year that his parents were killed by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewage.org/wiki/he/Article:David_Seymour_-_Biography&lt;/ref&gt; Chim photographed for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', along with ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]],'' ''[[Paris-Match]]'' and ''Regards.''

In 1948 he received a commission through [[UNICEF]] and traveled to Austria, Hungary, Italy, Poland and Germany to document the plight of World War II refugee children. Inge Bondi, Chim scholar, said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Chim's heart had always gone out to children, and they reacted to him with complete acceptance. They seemed oblivious of him, but he noticed every little movement, every little pain, every little pleasure. There is no artifice, no bravura of lighting expertise in Chim's photographs of the children. They speak simply from his pictures, as if alive. This intellectual, so adept at analyzing the most complex political situations, so comfortable photographing heads of state, produced his greatest photographs to help children in need.&lt;ref name="Bondi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bondi|first=Inge|title=CHIM: The Photographs of David Seymour|publisher=Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Between 1949 and 1955 Chim travelled extensively throughout Europe and Israel, fulfilling assignments for major publications in Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name=ngabio/&gt; [[Edward Steichen]] included his imagery, including his simple but eloquent picture of the worn hands of an older worker clutching a dip-pen to practice the letter 'a', in [[MoMA]]'s 1955 world-touring [[The Family of Man]], seen by 9 million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Steichen, Edward | author2=Steichen, Edward, 1879-1973, (organizer.) | author3=Sandburg, Carl, 1878-1967, (writer of foreword.) | author4=Norman, Dorothy, 1905-1997, (writer of added text.) | author5=Lionni, Leo, 1910-1999, (book designer.) | author6=Mason, Jerry, (editor.) | author7=Stoller, Ezra, (photographer.) | author8=Museum of Modern Art (New York, N.Y.) | title=The family of man : the photographic exhibition | publication-date=1955 | publisher=Published for the Museum of Modern Art by Simon and Schuster in collaboration with the Maco Magazine Corporation | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10809600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnum Photos==
In 1947, Chim co-founded the [[Magnum Photos]] photography cooperative, together with [[Robert Capa]] and [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], whom he had befriended in Paris in the 1930s. As Inge Bondi, Chim scholar, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Photojournalism was about to enter a golden decade. Television was not yet available to broadcast world events, and editors and the public were eager for news, from which they had been cut off during the fascist years and war years.&lt;ref name="Bondi"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Capa's death in 1954, Chim became president of Magnum Photos. He held that post until his death on November 10, 1956.&lt;ref name=ngabio/&gt;

==Death==
On November 10, 1956, Chim was killed while driving to photograph an exchange of wounded soldiers at El Quantara (along with French photographer Jean Roy) by Egyptian machinegun fire four days after the armistice of the [[Suez Crisis|1956 Suez War]], ten days before his 45th birthday.&lt;ref name=ngabio/&gt;

Chim's work remains available by way of Magnum Photos and his estate is managed by nephew [[Ben Shneiderman]] and niece Helen Sarid.

==Aftermath==
In a press conference after the news emerged, MACC director of investigations Mustafar Ali said Ahmad Sarbani went to the MACC building without prior appointment.&lt;ref name="found"/&gt; Two MACC investigating officers who met Ahmad Sarbani were suspended on 8 April.&lt;ref name="failed"/&gt; The MACC also announced that all business with accused persons, suspects, witnesses and complainants would be conducted only on the ground floor with heightened supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MACC to use ground floor for business with public |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/04/08/macc-to-use-ground-floor-for-business-with-public/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=8 April 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820154140/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/04/08/macc-to-use-ground-floor-for-business-with-public/ |archivedate=20 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarbani's wife, Maziah, told the court that her husband was "very calm, patient and rational" and would "never" have committed suicide.&lt;ref name="never"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ahmad Sarbani would not commit suicide, wife tells inquest |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/7/4/nation/20110704141101&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=4 July 2011 |last=Goh |first=Lisa |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710060927/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F7%2F4%2Fnation%2F20110704141101&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

;Schenker Logistics
Schenker Logistics senior executive Wan Zainal Abidin Wan Zaki denied that Sarbani ever took bribes from his company. Zainal Abidin said Sarbani called him at 8:55pm on 4 April to tell him that his name was mentioned by Sarbani when questioned by the MACC. He also told the court he felt Sarbani was being pressured. Zainal Abidin last spoke to Sarbani at 9:55pm on 5 April to ask how he was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ahmad Sarbani didn’t take money from company, inquest told |url=https://www.mysinchew.com/node/60201 |work=[[Sin Chew Daily]] |date=8 July 2011 |author=Bernama |authorlink=Bernama |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830144117/http://www.mysinchew.com/node/60201 |archivedate=30 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Customs officers
Customs officer Abdul Rahim Abdul Kadir, who among those arrested in the MACC crackdown on tax evasion and money laundering, told the court that he was beaten and forced to confess to accepting bribes by the MACC.&lt;ref name="beaten"/&gt; He said he lodged a police report on the incident then retracted it out of fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MACC ‘victim’ retracted police report out of fear |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/macc-victim-retracted-police-report-out-of-fear/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=14 July 2011 |last=Chi |first=Melissa |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717235212/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/macc-victim-retracted-police-report-out-of-fear |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Customs officer, Mohd Khairul Hisyam Mohd Gazali, said Sarbani told him on 2 April that he was pressured by the MACC to confess that he had accepted bribes but refused to give in.&lt;ref name="beaten"/&gt;

Three of Sarbani's colleagues testified that Sarbani was calm and patient man with "high integrity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sarbaini seorang tenang, tidak mudah melatah, kata rakan |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/bahasa/article/sarbaini-seorang-tenang-tidak-mudah-melatah-kata-rakan/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2011 |language=Malay |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718103330/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/bahasa/article/sarbaini-seorang-tenang-tidak-mudah-melatah-kata-rakan |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;MACC
Investigating officer Abdul Ghani Ali testified that he was under orders from KL MACC investigation unit head Mohd Fauzi Husin not to allow Sarbani to change his statement on 6 April.&lt;ref name="graft"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sarbaini not allowed to change graft confession, says MACC man |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/sarbaini-not-allowed-to-change-graft-confession-says-macc-man/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=12 July 2011 |last=Boo |first=Su-Lyn |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715145714/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/sarbaini-not-allowed-to-change-graft-confession-says-macc-man |archivedate=15 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he ordered Sarbani to wait in the MACC office before Sarbani was found dead.&lt;ref name="graft"/&gt; Ghani also said: "Throughout my career, I think no one has confessed like this before. I’ve never met a suspect who confessed."&lt;ref name="graft"/&gt;

Assistant superintendent Mohd Rosly Mohd Saup testified that Sarbani denied accepting bribes from a Top Mark officer on 2 April.&lt;ref name="graft"/&gt;

Assistant superintendent Sheikh Niza Khairy Sheikh Mohamad said Sarbani confessed to him on 4 April to receiving "goodwill payments" and that Sarbani went to the MACC office two days later to change his statement.&lt;ref name="graft"/&gt;

;Forensics
DSP Sharul Othman Mansor from the [[Bukit Aman]] Forensic Division said Sarbani fell 10&amp;nbsp;m to his death.&lt;ref name="confided"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sarbaini confided in wife about claims, inquest told |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/7/5/nation/9030502&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=5 July 2011 |last=Goh |first=Lisa |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708053145/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F7%2F5%2Fnation%2F9030502&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic investigator DSP Sharul Othman Mansor told the court that Sarbani's death was neither suicide nor murder. He instead claimed that Sarbani tried to jump over the roof of the badminton court, but missed and fell to his death. Sharul added that there were no signs of a struggle and that an optical illusion made the roof appear near to the corner of the window.&lt;ref name="rulesout"&gt;{{cite news |title=Investigator rules out suicide, homicide in Sarbaini death |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/investigator-rules-out-suicide-homicide-in-sarbaini-death/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=15 July 2011 |last=Chi |first=Melissa |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718090816/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/investigator-rules-out-suicide-homicide-in-sarbaini-death |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic pathologist Faridah Mohd Noor, who performed the autopsy, said the death was "accidental" based on "the injuries and circumstantial evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forensic pathologist tells court Sarbaini fell accidentally to his death |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/forensic-pathologist-tells-court-sarbaini-fell-accidentally-to-his-death/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=2 August 2011 |first=Melissa |last=Chi |accessdate=3 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015082058/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/forensic-pathologist-tells-court-sarbaini-fell-accidentally-to-his-death/ |archivedate=15 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Verdict====
On 26 September 2011, the coroner's court ruled Sarbani's death an accident. Coroner Aizatul Akmal Maharani said the fear of being arrested must have preyed heavily on Ahmad Sarbani’s mind so as to make him consider the window exit.&lt;ref name="ruling"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sarbaini’s death ruled a misadventure |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/sarbainis-death-ruled-an-accident/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=26 September 2011 |first=Debra |last=Chong |accessdate=5 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929132206/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/sarbainis-death-ruled-an-accident |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aizatul also remarked that the MACC officer tasked to look after Sarbani on 6 April had been "negligent."&lt;ref name="ruling"/&gt;

'''Ali Jawad al-Sheikh''' ({{lang-ar|علي جواد الشيخ}}) was a 14-year-old Bahraini who died in the hospital on 31 August 2011 after reportedly being hit in the head by a [[tear gas canister]] shot by Bahraini security forces during the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|Bahraini uprising]]. The Bahraini government denied security force involvement in his death and offered a reward for information on the incident. Activists, however, began a series of large protests after his funeral.

==Background==
{{Further|Bahraini uprising (2011–present)}}
As part of a string of [[Arab Spring|protests]] that occurred across the Arab World following the self-immolation and eventual death of [[Mohammed Bouazizi]] in [[2010-2011 Tunisian protests|Tunisia]], the mostly [[Shia]] population of Bahrain took to the streets demanding greater freedoms.&lt;ref name="JazeeraBah14Feb"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Staff writer]] | title = Bahrain Activists in 'Day of Rage'&amp;nbsp;– Anti-Government Protests in Shia Villages Around the Capital Leave Several People Injured and One Person Reported Dead | date=14 February 2011 | publisher=[[Al-Jazeera English]] | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011214925802473.html | accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was seen as potentially destabilising to the [[Sunni]]-led regime of Bahrain, following which a brutal government crackdown led to widespread suppressions of the Shia people across many sectors,&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Cockburn|Cockburn, Patrick]] (18 March 2011).

==Death==
{{External media | video1 = {{Youtube|jTaCTbiCxjc|Al Jazeera English report about Ali's death (with Arabic translation)}} }}
A number of protesters, including Isa Hassan, Ali's uncle, took part in a demonstration in [[Sitra]], [[Bahrain]] on 31 August just after [[Fajr|morning prayers]]. They stated that they were "confronted by the police, who fired tear gas at them from roughly 20 feet away" and causing Ali Jawad al-Sheikh's death. In an interview with the ''[[Associated Press]]'', Isa explained that "they are supposed to lob the canisters of gas, not shoot them at people. Police used it as a weapon."&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bahraini boy killed in protest |author= |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/08/2011831132740548678.html |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=August 31, 2011 |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=A 14-Year-Old Boy Is Killed in Bahrain as Security Forces Break Up a Protest |author=J.

After his death, Ali's body was removed from the hospital and moved to the morgue,&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; where the [[Ministry of the Interior (Bahrain)|Interior ministry]] conducted an [[autopsy]] and compiled a forensic report based on the results.&lt;ref name="bici"/&gt;{{rp|page=255}} Investigators from the [[Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry]] were present during the autopsy, and compiled their own forensic report.&lt;ref name="bici" /&gt;{{rp|page=255}}  In the afternoon, Osama al-Asfoor, the [[Director of Public Prosecutions|head of public prosecution]], stated that the autopsy had shown that "Ali had died of injuries to the back of his neck" and that "the boy had injuries under his chin and bruises on his face, hand, knees and pelvic area." However, he also added that a "blood examination showed no effects of tear gas exposure."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;  The Interior ministry's forensic report concluded that Ali's injuries were inconsistent with an impact from a tear gas canister, as the markings on his neck were too large.&lt;ref name="bici" /&gt;{{rp|page=255}}  The Commission's forensic report concluded that Ali's injuries were consistent with an impact from an unexploded tear gas canister fired at short range.&lt;ref name="bici" /&gt;{{rp|page=255}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:Ali Jawad al-Sheikh by Ahmad Nady.jpg|thumb|upright|Political cartoon of Ali Jawad al-Sheikh by [[Ahmad Nady]].]]
Photographs of Ali directly after being injured were released by the [[Human_rights_in_Bahrain#Human_Rights_Groups|Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights]]. [[Mohammed al-Maskati]], the leader of the Society, said that, "The picture is affecting people." A videotape had also been made of Ali's family around his body in the hospital. [[Nabeel Rajab]], the president of the [[Bahrain Centre for Human Rights]], explained that the video was "a gift to the people".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; The father of Ali, Jawad al-Sheikh, asked in an interview with [[CNN]] for "human rights groups to take steps against Bahrain's leaders, saying, 'I lost my child. ... He does not deserve this destiny.'"&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |title=Police, protesters battle in Bahrain's streets after boy's death |author= |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/08/31/bahrain.death/ |newspaper=[[CNN]] |date=August 31, 2011 |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government acknowledged Ali's death, but stated in a report from the state-run news agency that "no reported police action against lawbreakers in Sitra" had occurred the morning of that day and that the security forces had last been involved in "dispersing a small group of around 10 people at 1:15 a.m." that day. The [[Ministry of the Interior (Bahrain)|Ministry of the Interior]] then also set out a "reward of more than $26,000 for information about those responsible for his death."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Activists who had taken part in the uprising stated that police had surrounded the hospital where Ali had died, effectively preventing any gatherings of people in the area. The activists also stated their intention to have a protest on 1 September 2011, after attending Ali's funeral earlier that day.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Clashes with police, however, began on 31 August and continued into the morning of September 1.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

===Funeral and protests===
The [[funeral procession]] was held early on 1 September, with photographs of Ali both before he died and of his dead body covering the coffin. It had already been delayed for some hours, as Ali's father was unwilling to sign the death certificate for release of his son's body, since the cause of death listed was stated to be "unknown". It is uncertain if the certificate was ever signed or if the body was just released.&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Large Protest in Bahrain After Boy’s Death |author=J. David Goodman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/world/middleeast/02bahrain.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=September 1, 2011 |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists stated that thousands of people attended his funeral. Afterwards, the mourners began marching in the streets of Sitra carrying pictures of Ali and chanting 'Down, down, [[Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa|Hamad]]!'". No security personnel were present at the protest and the protesters had dispersed by the afternoon. However, extensive protests were held in the national capital of [[Manama]] that night as the protesters tried to take back control of the [[Pearl Roundabout]], which was the site of protests earlier in the year until a government crackdown and the destruction of the monument. Government forces used tear gas and blocked roads with buses to stop the protests.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;

==Local reactions==
[[Isa Qassim|Sheik Isa Qassim]], a senior Shiite cleric, has blamed security forces for the death of Ali Jawad, saying, "the killing of a 14-year-old boy by security forces during an anti-government demonstration Wednesday shows that the island nation’s Sunni rulers are not listening to people’s demands for greater rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bahrain cleric blames police for protester's death |author=Brian Murphy |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-09-01/world/30104623_1_bahrain-s-shiite-sitra-senior-shiite-cleric |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] |date=September 1, 2011 |accessdate=October 5, 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diploidization''' is the process of converting a polyploid genome back into a diploid one. [[Polyploid]]y is a product of whole genome duplication (WGD) and is followed by diploidization as a result of genome shock.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time.

Yesterday’s Polyploids and the Mystery of Diploidization Nat Rev Genet. 2001 May;2(5): 333-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant kingdom has undergone multiple events of polyploidization followed by diploidization in both ancient and recent lineages.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been hypothesized that vertebrate genomes have gone through two rounds of [[paleopolyploidy]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Kenneth H. Yesterday's Polyploids and the Mystery of Diploidization Nat Rev Genet. 2001 May;2(5): 333–341.&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms of diploidization are poorly understood but patterns of chromosomal loss and evolution of novel genes are observed in the process.

== Elimination of duplicated genes ==

Upon the formation of new polyploids, large sections of DNA are rapidly lost from one genome.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 2009, 19: 600–606&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of DNA effectively achieves two purposes. First, the eliminated copy restores the normal gene dosage in the diploid organism.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the changes in chromosomal genetic structure increase the divergence of the homoeologous chromosomes (similar chromosomes from inter-species hybrid) and promotes [[homologous chromosome]] pairing.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt; Both are important in terms of adjusting to the induced genome shock.

== Evolution of genes to ensure correct chromosome pairing ==

There have been rare events in which genes that ensure proper chromosome pairing have evolved shortly after polyploidization. One such gene, Ph1, exists in hexaploid wheat.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Perez, E,, P. Shaw and G. Moore The Ph1 locus is needed to ensure specific somatic and meiotic centromere association Nature 411: 204-207&lt;/ref&gt; These genes keep the two sets of genomes separately by either spatially separating them or giving them a unique chromatin identity to facilitate recognition from its homologous pair. This prevents the need of rapid gene loss to speed up homeologous chromosome diversification.

== Drive for diploidization ==
; Coordinate inter-genomic gene expression
: Duplicated genes often result in increased dosage of gene products. Doubled dosages are sometimes lethal to the organism thus the two genome copies must coordinate in a structured fashion to maintain normal nuclear activity.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt; Many mechanisms of diploidization promote this coordination.
; Maintain intra-genomic chromosome pairing at meiosis
: Chromosome pairing during meiosis is a significant challenge for polyploids. Homoeologous chromosomes with similar genetic content may pair with each other resulting in trivalent or tetravalent interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 2009, 19: 600–606&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution of these structures results in chromosome breakage, rearrangement, and gamete infertility. Diploidization is often required to restore the cell’s ability to stably go through meiosis.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt;
; Reduce costs of maintaining large, duplicated genomes
: Large genomes are costly to synthesize during replication and hard to maintain.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of duplicated genes during diploidization effectively reduces the overall size of the genome.

== Revolutionary vs. evolutionary changes ==
Once a polyploid is made, either synthetically or naturally, the genome goes through a period of "genome shock". Genome shock can be defined as a stage in which the genome experiences massive reorganization and structural changes to deal with the external stress (X-ray damage, chromosome duplication, etc.) imposed upon the genome.&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, Barbara The significance of responses of the genome to challenge Science 1984, 226: 792–801&lt;/ref&gt; Such changes are termed '''revolutionary changes''' and occur early in the process of diploidization.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt; Revolutionary changes ensure that the organism has a stable genome that can be passed to its progeny.

At the end of this process, certain duplicated genes may be preserved thus allowing evolution to shape them into novel functions. This is commonly termed as neofunctionalization. The mechanism of retaining duplicated genes is poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that dosage balance may play a key role in shaping the evolutionary fates of duplicated genes.&lt;ref&gt; Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary changes refer to the long process of converting duplicated genes into diverse, functional gene derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
There are many ways in which a polyploid organism can convert back to a diploid status. This is usually achieved by elimination of duplicated genes. The main goals of diploidization are: (1) To ensure proper gene dosage; and (2) to maintain stable cellular division processes. It should be noted that this process does not need to occur rapidly for all chromosomes in one or few steps. In recent polyploid events, segments of the genome may still remain in a tetraploid status. In other words, diploidization is a long ongoing process that is shaped by both intrinsic and evolutionary drives.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Kenneth H. Yesterday’s Polyploids and the Mystery of Diploidization Nat Rev Genet. 2001 May;2(5): 333–341.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abnormal chromosome pairing ===
Normally, homologous chromosomes pair up in bivalents during meiosis and separate into different daughter cells. However, when multiple copies of similar chromosomes are present in the nucleus, homeologous chromosomes can also pair with homologous chromosomes resulting in the formation of trivalents or multivalents.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 2009, 19: 600–606&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of multivalents results in unequal division of the chromosomes and lead to daughter cells lacking one or few chromosomes.

=== Illegitimate recombination ===
When homeologous chromosomes pair up though bivalents or multivalents, illegitimate genetic crossovers may occur.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 2009, 19: 600–606&lt;/ref&gt; Since the chromosomes may differ in genetic structure and content, segments of the chromosome may be shuffled around resulting in massive gene loss. Additionally, [[illegitimate recombination]]s may also result in dicentric chromosomes lead to chromosome breakage during anaphase.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 2009, 19: 600–606&lt;/ref&gt; This further contributes to gene loss on duplicated chromosomes.

=== Relaxed selective pressure on duplicated genes ===
The duplicated copies of a gene are commonly non-essential to the plant’s ability to maintain normal growth and development.

=== Neofunctionalization ===
As mentioned earlier, duplicated genes are under relaxed selective pressure. Thus it may also be subject to [[neofunctionalization]], the process in which a duplicated gene obtains a novel function.

Other than [[parasite]]s and disease, [[predation]] is a threat to [[sheep]] health and thereby the profitability of sheep raising. Sheep have very little ability to defend themselves, even when compared with other prey species kept as [[livestock]]. Even if sheep are not directly bitten or survive an attack, they may die from panic or from injuries sustained.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In [[Africa]], [[Australia]], the [[Americas]], and parts of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] predators can be a serious problem. In contrast, some nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators. Many islands that are known for extensive sheep husbandry are suitable largely because of their predator-free status.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; Worldwide, [[canid]]s&amp;mdash;including the domestic [[dog]]&amp;mdash;are responsible for the majority of sheep deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sheep mauled by wild dogs |url=http://www.tweednews.com.au/localnews/storydisplay.cfm?storyid=3761352&amp;thesection=localnews&amp;thesubsection=&amp;thesecondsubsection= |work=Tweed Daily News |date=2008-01-18 |accessdate=2008-01-21 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gareth |last=Lewis  |title=Sheep worrying leads to warning from farmers |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/debusiness/news/display.var.1980009.0.sheep_worrying_leads_to_warning_from_farmers.php |work=The Daily Echo |date=2008-01-21 |accessdate=2008-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canids"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biology and Conservation of Wild Canids |last=Macdonald |first=David Whyte |author2=Claudio Sillero-Zubiri |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-851555-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other animals that prey on sheep include: [[felidae|felines]], [[Giant panda|pandas]], [[bears]], [[birds of prey]], [[bats]], [[Razorback|feral hogs]],&lt;ref name="storey"&gt;{{cite book |title=Storey's Guide to Raising Sheep |last=Simmons |first=Paula |author2=Carol Ekarius |year=2001 |publisher=Storey Publishing LLC |location=North Adams, MA |isbn=978-1-58017-262-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hyenas]].

==Relation to sheep behavior==
Sheep [[Flight or fight|flight]] behavior is cited in one major study in [[California]] as the major stimulus responsible for eliciting predatory behavior in [[coyotes]]. Even coyotes that had not previously been exposed to sheep demonstrated predatory behavior when exposed to them for the first time. Of particular interest was that coyotes with no previous prey-killing experience readily attacked and killed sheep when given the chance. The coyotes were likely to attack sheep that exhibited flight behavior even when these coyotes were not hungry. The same study also determined that dominant coyotes were more likely to attack sheep.&lt;ref name="UCHopland"&gt;{{Cite journal|publication-date=Nov 2001 |title=Sheep killing coyotes a continuing delimma for ranchers |last=Timm |first=Robert M. |author2=Guy Connolly |year=2001 |publisher=California Agriculture |url=http://calag.ucop.edu/0106ND/pdfs/predator1769.pdf |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611172030/http://calag.ucop.edu/0106ND/pdfs/predator1769.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By region==

===North America===
[[Image:Ewe with coyote throat wound.jpg|thumb|right|A shorn ewe that was killed by a coyote]]
According to the [[National Agricultural Statistics Service]], 224,200 sheep were killed in the U.S. by predators in 2004, comprising approximately 37% of all bovine deaths for that year.&lt;ref name="nass"&gt;{{Cite journal| publication-date =May 6, 2005 | title =Sheep and Goats Death Loss  | publisher =[[National Agricultural Statistics Service]] | url =http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1628 | accessdate = 2007-12-27| postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sheep lost in that year represented a sum total of 18.3 million dollars for sheep producers.&lt;ref name="nass"/&gt; [[Coyote]]s were responsible for 60.5% of all deaths, with the next largest being domestic dogs at 13.3%.&lt;ref name="nass"/&gt; Other North American predators of sheep included [[cougar]]s (5.7%), [[bobcat]]s (4.9%), [[eagle]]s (2.8%), [[bear]]s (3.8%), and [[fox]]es (1.9%).&lt;ref name="nass"/&gt; [[Wolves]], [[raven]]s, [[New World vulture|vulture]]s, and other animals together made up the remaining 7.1% of deaths.&lt;ref name="nass"/&gt; As all NASS statistics on sheep only take into account sheep after docking, the American Sheep Industry Association estimates that an additional 50-60,000 lambs were killed (before docking) that were not a part of the count.&lt;ref name="asia"&gt;{{Cite journal| publication-date =May 6, 2005 | title =Sheep and Predator Management -2005 | publisher =American Sheep Industry Association | url =http://www.sheepusa.org/index.phtml?page=site/text&amp;nav_id=985657ba31b8c58581a120f26a0ca123 | accessdate = 2007-12-27| postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of sheep lost to predators may also be higher when considering that reports are generally only made when there is a reasonable expectation that a producer will be financially reimbursed for the loss.&lt;ref name="begin"&gt;{{cite book |title= Beginning Shepherd's Manual, Second Edition|last=Smith M.S. |first=Barbara |author2=Mark Aseltine PhD|author3=Gerald Kennedy DVM |year=1997 |publisher=Iowa State University Press |location=Ames, Iowa |isbn=0-8138-2799-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
In South America, the only widespread potential predators of sheep are cougars and [[jaguar]]s, both of which are known to prey on livestock regularly. South American canids such as the [[Maned wolf]] and foxes of the genus ''[[Pseudalopex]]'' are also blamed for sheep deaths, but no evidence for a statistically significant amount of predation by ''most'' of these species has ever been presented.&lt;ref name="canids"/&gt; However, the [[culpeo]] is a threat to sheep, and is responsible for 60% of the predator losses in Patagonia.&lt;ref name="canids"/&gt;

===Africa===
Though large, the [[South African]] sheep industry is significantly hindered by the innumerable predators present in the country.&lt;ref name="sheep and goat"&gt;{{cite book |title= Sheep and Goat Science, Fifth Edition|last=Ensminger |first=Dr. M.E. |author2=Dr. R.O. Parker |year=1986 |publisher=The Interstate Printers and Publishers Inc |location=Danville, Illinois |isbn=0-8134-2464-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Schoenian | first =Susan | title =Sheep Basics | work =Sheep101.info | url =http://www.sheep101.info/sheepbasics.html | accessdate =2007-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other African nations that rely on sheep face a similar problem.&lt;ref name="sheep and goat"/&gt;

[[Black-backed jackal]]s are the most significant sheep predators of southern and eastern Africa. Jackal predation typically peaks during droughts when wild food is scarce and the sheep are weakened. [[Merino]] sheep tend to be the most vulnerable, due to their habit of scattering upon attack, unlike fat-tailed sheep which bunch together for defence. In [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] between 1965 and 1971, a study on the stomach contents of over 400 jackals showed that sheep constituted 6% of the diet of jackals living in game reserves, and 27% for those living near farming districts. A similar study in [[Natal (region)|Natal]] revealed that sheep constituted 35% of the resident jackal's diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://past.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/158/1/172.pdf Past and Present - Sign In Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia and New Zealand===
[[Image:Ram attack.JPG|thumb|200px|One of several rams and wethers that were killed during an attack by [[Bull Arab|domestic dogs]].]] The main Australian predator of sheep is the [[dingo]], which is a large-enough danger to sheep to precipitate the construction of the world's largest fence: the [[Dingo Fence]]. [[Red fox]]es, also, may prey on 10-30% of lambs, costing [[Australia]]ns sheep breeders more than [[A$]]100 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;Southern New England Landcare Group, ''Foxchat'' No. 71, June–July 1009&lt;/ref&gt; 
Annual [[bait (luring substance)|bait]]ing programs are conducted to reduce the number of dingoes and foxes. Uncontrolled domestic dogs also regularly menace and kill sheep. Occasionally [[wedge-tailed eagle]]s will kill young sheep up to and including [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|hogget]] size sheep. In contrast, New Zealand has no remaining large [[carnivore]]s. The only wild animal known to attack sheep in New Zealand is the rare, unusual [[kea]] parrot endemic to the country's [[South Island]]. Also, [[feral|feral dogs]] have been a problem.

Prior to their extinction in [[Tasmania]] the [[thylacine]] (''Thylacinus cynocephalus''), also called the Tasmanian tiger, was also a major predator of sheep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

===British Isles===
Brown bears are thought to have become extinct in the [[British Isles]] in the year 500,&lt;ref name="britbear"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toothandclaw.org.uk/species.asp |title=Brown Bear |work= |publisher=Tooth &amp; Claw |accessdate=2008-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516054756/http://www.toothandclaw.org.uk/species.asp |archivedate=2008-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the last wolves were wiped out in 1786.&lt;ref name="IRISHWOLVES"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ucd.ie/gsi/pdf/33-2/lupus.pdf| title = A geographical perspective on the decline and extermination of the Irish wolf canis lupus | work = Kieran R. Hickey | publisher = Department of Geography, National University of Ireland, Galway | accessdate = 2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the only wild animals remaining as a tangible threat to lambs in the British Isles are the [[red fox]], [[badger]], and predatory birds.  Domestic dogs are also a common cause of predation of lambs and sheep (they can also sometimes die of shock after any attempted predation or attack). If the neck and head of a lamb are still attached, and some or all of the organs consumed via biting a hole into the lower abdomen, but not much else, this is often a sign of badger predation.  Often only the lamb's stomach is ravaged - badgers like to drink the milk inside.  If the badger is not at all hungry, it may merely play with the carcass - biting the ears, in particular.  If the head's bitten off the carcass, it is usually a fox.  Dog damage to a lamb is more indiscriminate/variable, and the carcass' condition does not follow any fixed form.  Badgers will sometimes bite adult sheep without killing them - this is sometimes observed when a ewe is defending her lamb from the badger.  This almost always leads to infection around the bite - death will follow if costly treatment is not administered.  Badger predation varies regionally - in many areas it is commonplace, with the culprit sometimes caught in the act, whereas in some other sheep-farming areas with badgers, attacks are rare/not definitely identified.  Crows such as the [[hooded crow]] are known to take small lambs, often first disabling them by pecking out their eyes; if a sheep has fallen over during parturition or bad weather and cannot get up, again crows will first attack their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=26307 ''Hooded Crow: Corvus cornix'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed, N. Stromberg] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126090957/http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=26307 |date=2010-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger predatory birds such as [[golden eagles]] and large owls pose a threat to sheep in the north of Britain, where their ranges remain stable.

===Mainland Europe===
In [[Greece]], between April 1989 and June 1991, 21,000 sheep and goats were killed by wolves. In 1998 it was 5,894 sheep and goats.&lt;ref name="GW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation Action Plan for the golden jackal (Canis aureus) in Greece |work= |publisher=WWF Greece |url=http://www.lcie.org/Docs/Action%20Plans/Greece%20Golden%20Jackal%20Action%20Plan%202004.pdf |accessdate=2007-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227175433/http://www.lcie.org/Docs/Action%20Plans/Greece%20Golden%20Jackal%20Action%20Plan%202004.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In southern [[Bulgaria]], [[golden jackal]]s were recorded to have attacked 1,053 sheep between 1982-87.&lt;ref name="GW" /&gt;

===Asia===
A study on livestock predation taken in [[Tibet]] showed that the wolf was the most prominent predator, accounting for 60% of the total livestock losses, followed by the [[snow leopard]] (38%) and [[Eurasian lynx]] (2%). Sheep were the second most targeted victims after goats, amounting to over 30% of losses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/42567458h670u205/ "Carnivore-Caused Livestock Mortality in Trans-Himalaya"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
[[Image:Protector of the sheep.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Maremma Sheepdog]] [[livestock guardian dog]] with its flock]]
Sheep producers have used a wide variety of measures to try to combat predation throughout history. Pre-modern shepherds had only the most basic of tools: their own presence, [[livestock guardian dogs]], and  protective structures such as [[barn]]s and [[fencing]]. Fencing (both regular and [[Electric fence|electric]]), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely&amp;ndash;used methods of protection today.&lt;ref name="living"&gt;{{cite book |title=Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock |last=Wooster |first=Chuck |others=Geoff Hansen (Photography) |year=2005 |publisher=The Lyons Press |location=Guilford, Connecticut |isbn= 1-59228-531-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas sheepdogs [[herd]] sheep, guardian dogs are trained to integrate into flocks and protect them from predators. The ability of these dogs to do so is a transference of the canine [[Pack (canine)|pack]] social structure on to a flock. Following their invention, the focus in dealing with predators shifted to the nearly exclusive use of [[guns]], [[Animal trapping|traps]], and [[poisons]] to kill predators both defensively and preemptively.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; The population of predator species plummeted worldwide, pushing some to [[extinction]] (such as the [[thylacine]]) or significantly reducing their original ranges. With the appearance of the [[environmentalism|environmental]] and [[conservation movement]]s, and subsequent [[federated state|state]], [[province (country subdivision)|provincial]], national and international legislation, simply exterminating predator species failed to be a legally viable option for protecting flocks.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; However, many countries maintain government agencies&amp;mdash;such as the Wildlife Services program, a wing of the [[USDA]]'s [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] &amp;mdash;to shoot, poison and trap predators that threaten sheep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/fsheet_faq_notice/fs_wspredation.html |title=Effects of Wildlife Services on Predator Populations |date=October 2001 |publisher=Wildlife Services |accessdate=2008-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030114154813/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/fsheet_faq_notice/fs_wspredation.html |archivedate=2003-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildlife conservation organizations charge that this killing is both indiscriminate and ineffective at protecting sheep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.predatordefense.org/ |title=Predator Defense |accessdate=2008-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.predatordefense.org/content/PD_Berger_Sheep_Econ.pdf |title=Carnivore-Livestock Conflicts: Effects of Subsidized Predator Control and Economic Correlates on the  Sheep Industry |accessdate=2008-01-24 |author=Kim Murray Berger |publisher=[[Wildlife Conservation Society]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070727084714/http://www.predatordefense.org/content/PD_Berger_Sheep_Econ.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s saw an ensuing resurgence in the use of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control, many of them non&amp;ndash;lethal.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Modern Shepherd |last=Brown |first=Dave |author2=Sam Meadowcroft |year=1996 |publisher=Farming Press |location=Wharfedale Road, Ipswich 1P1 4LG, United Kingdom |isbn=0-85236-188-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donkey]]s and [[guard llama]]s or [[alpaca]]s have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; Interspecific pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or [[horses]], make also help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep.&lt;ref name="living"/&gt; In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non&amp;ndash;lethal predator deterrents such as motion&amp;ndash;activated lights and noisy alarms.

'''Animal dysthanasia''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]], meaning “difficult death”: dys (bad; difficult) + thanatos (death)) refers to the practice of prolonging the life of animals that are seriously or even terminally ill and that are potentially experiencing suffering. Animal dysthanasia is a recent concept, emerging from changes in the social perception of animals and from advances in [[veterinary medicine|veterinary care]].

== Context ==
Animal dysthanasia is particularly relevant in the context of small animal practice. For centuries, domestic animals in Western societies used to be mainly [[livestock|farm animals]]. With the industrialization process, humans become increasingly concentrated in urban areas, having preferential contact with [[Pet|companion animals]], namely cats and dogs. While farm animals are widely seen as property, companion animals are perceived as family members with whom humans keep close bonds and develop strong emotional relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Sandøe P &amp; Christiansen SB (2008) "The Changing Face of Animal Ethics", ''Ethics of Animal Use''. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing pp.1-14&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, scientific advances in the field of [[veterinary medicine]] enable practitioners to reach accurate diagnoses faster and more reliably than before, allowing life-threatening illnesses to be identified in the early stages of their development. In addition, more advanced options of treatment are currently available which may sometimes be used to prolong the lives of animals as much as possible regardless of their quality.&lt;ref&gt;Rollin BE (2006) "Euthanasia and quality of life", ''Journal American Veterinary Medical Association'', 228(7): 1014-1016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Companion Animal Euthanasia Training Academy (CAETA) defines dysthanasia differently. To align more closely with the current definition of euthanasia, the act of humanely terminating life, CAETA views dysthanasia as the opposite of euthanasia; an actual bad death event wherein the euthanasia went poorly. Any lack of care or suffering leading up to death is considered a lack of veterinary hospice support during the end of life.   
&lt;ref&gt;Cooney, KA (2017) "Overview of Companion Animal Euthanasia" Module One; Online Program, www.caetainternational.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
Decision upon [[animal euthanasia]] often takes into account the relief of pain and suffering. Depending on how one defines the term, Animal dysthanasia occurs because there is no agreement upon the acceptable and recognizable endpoints of the lives of companion animals. This is due to several reasons. The keeper (guardian; owner) may wish to extend the animal’s life because he rejects euthanasia as an acceptable solution. On the other hand, the veterinarian may have a scientific interest on studying the progress of a specific illness or even a financial interest in keeping the patient alive.&lt;ref&gt;Rollin BE (2005) “Ethics of Critical Care”, ''Journal of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care'', 15(4): 233-239&lt;/ref&gt; If one defines dysthanasia as an actual bad death event, causes include use of improper euthanasia techniques or failure to render an animal free of pain or distress.  Proper training in euthanasia procedures is ideal to reduce dysthanasia and subsequent suffering. The keeper and the veterinarian may also want to make use of all possible treatment resources before making the decision of euthanasia. Genuine belief on the animal’s recovery and emotional attachment can also interfere on the decision-making process of euthanasia. Situations like these can be especially problematic in some veterinary specialities like small animal [[oncology]] where the course of the disease may be difficult to predict and the treatments themselves can cause severe distress.

'''Edward Aloysius Kenney''' (August 11, 1884 &amp;ndash; January 27, 1938) was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[New Jersey]].

==Biography==
Kenney was born on August 11, 1884 in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]] and attended the [[Clinton Public School District|public schools]]. He graduated from [[Clinton High School (Clinton, Massachusetts)|Clinton High School]] in 1902. He then graduated from [[Williams College]] in 1906, and from the law department of [[New York University]] in [[New York City]] in 1908.  He was admitted to the [[New York State Bar Association]] in 1908 and commenced practice in New York City.  He moved to [[Cliffside Park, New Jersey]] in 1916 and continued the [[practice of law]].

An '''entheogen''' is a class of [[psychoactive substance]]s&lt;!-- drugs or animal venoms --&gt; that induce any type of [[spiritual experience]] aimed at [[spiritual development|development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology - Jurema-Preta (Mimosa tenuiflora [Willd.] Poir.): a review of its traditional use, phytochemistry and pharmacology |publisher=scielo.br |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-89132008000500010&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en |accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term entheogen is often chosen to contrast [[recreational drug use|recreational use]] of the same drugs.

The [[religion|religious]], [[shamanism|shamanic]], or [[spirituality|spiritual]] significance of entheogens is well established in anthropological and modern contexts; entheogens have traditionally been used to supplement many diverse practices geared towards achieving [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]], including [[White magic|white]] and [[black magic]], [[sensory deprivation]], [[divinatory]], [[meditation]], [[yoga]], [[prayer]], [[trance]], [[ritual]]s, [[chanting]], [[hymn]]s like [[peyote song]]s, and [[Drum circle|drumming]].  In the 1960s the [[History of the hippie movement|hippie movement]] escalated its use to [[psychedelic art]], [[binaural beats]], [[sensory deprivation tank]]s, [[psychedelic music|music]], and [[rave|rave parties]].

==Etymology==

The [[neologism]] ''entheogen'' was coined in 1979 by a group of [[ethnobotany|ethnobotanists]] and scholars of [[mythology]] ([[Carl A. P. Ruck]], Jeremy Bigwood, Danny Staples, [[Richard Evans Schultes]], [[Jonathan Ott]] and [[R. Gordon Wasson]]). The term is derived from two words of [[Ancient Greek]], ἔνθεος (''éntheos'') and γενέσθαι (''genésthai''). The adjective ''entheos'' translates to English as "full of the god, inspired, possessed", and is the root of the English word "[[enthusiasm]]." The Greeks used it as a term of praise for poets and other artists. ''Genesthai'' means "to come into being." Thus, an entheogen is a drug that causes one to become inspired or to experience feelings of inspiration, often in a religious or "spiritual" manner.&lt;ref name=Godlaski2011&gt;{{cite journal |author=Godlaski, Theodore M |title=The God within |journal=Substance Use and Misuse |year=2011 |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=1217–1222 |doi=10.3109/10826084.2011.561722 |pmid=21692597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entheogen was coined as a replacement for the terms ''hallucinogen'' and ''[[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]''. ''Hallucinogen'' was popularized by [[Aldous Huxley]]'s experiences with [[mescaline]], which were published as ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' in 1954. ''Psychedelic'', in contrast, is a Greek neologism for "mind manifest", and was coined by psychiatrist [[Humphry Osmond]]; Huxley was a volunteer in experiments Osmond was conducting on mescaline.

Ruck et al. argued that the term ''hallucinogen'' was inappropriate owing to its etymological relationship to words relating to delirium and [[insanity]]. The term ''psychedelic'' was also seen as problematic, owing to the similarity in sound to words pertaining to [[psychosis]] and also due to the fact that it had become irreversibly associated with various connotations of 1960s [[popular culture|pop culture]]. In modern usage ''entheogen'' may be used synonymously with these terms, or it may be chosen to contrast with [[recreational drug use|recreational use]] of the same drugs. The meanings of the term ''entheogen'' were formally defined by Ruck et al.:

{{quote|In a strict sense, only those vision-producing drugs that can be shown to have figured in shamanic or religious rites would be designated entheogens, but in a looser sense, the term could also be applied to other drugs, both natural and artificial, that induce alterations of consciousness similar to those documented for ritual ingestion of traditional entheogens.|Ruck et al, 1979, ''Journal of Psychedelic Drugs''&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
Entheogens have been used by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Some countries have legislation that allows for traditional entheogen use. However, in the mid-20th century, after the [[History of lysergic acid diethylamide|discovery]] of LSD, and the intervention of [[psychedelic therapy]], the term ''entheogen'', invented in 1979, later became an umbrella term used to include artificial drugs, [[alternative medicine|alternative medical]] treatment, and spiritual practices, whether or not in a formal religious or traditional structure.

=== Ancient times ===
{{See also|Entheogenic drugs and the archaeological record}}
[[File:Flowering San Pedro cactus.jpg|thumb|alt=text|Flowering [[Echinopsis pachanoi|San Pedro]], an entheogenic cactus that has been used for over 3,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rudgley|first1=Richard|title=The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances|url=http://www.mescaline.com/sanpedro/|publisher=www.mescaline.com|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the vast majority of extracted mescaline is from columnar cacti, not vulnerable [[peyote]].&lt;ref&gt;http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/151962/0&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[R. Gordon Wasson]] and [[Giorgio Samorini]] have proposed several examples of the cultural use of entheogens that are found in the archaeological record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Giorgio |last1=Samorini |title=The 'Mushroom-Tree' of Plaincourault |journal=Eleusis |issue=8 |year=1997 |pages=29–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Giorgio |last1=Samorini |title=The 'Mushroom-Trees' in Christian Art |journal=Eleusis |issue=1 |year=1998 |pages=87–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemp seeds discovered by archaeologists at [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk]] suggest early ceremonial practices by the [[Scythians]] occurred during the 5th to 2nd century BC, confirming previous historical reports by [[Herodotus]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/882553191|title=The Amazons : lives and legends of warrior women across the ancient world|last=1946-|first=Mayor, Adrienne,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780691147208|location=Princeton|pages=147–149|oclc=882553191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s – present===
[[File:Synthetic mescaline powder i2001e0151 ccby3.jpg|right|thumb|Laboratory synthetic [[mescaline]]. Mescaline was the first (1887) [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] compound to be extracted and isolated from nature (from peyote).&lt;ref&gt;http://mescaline.com/exp/&lt;/ref&gt;]]

There now exist many [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] drugs with similar psychoactive properties, many derived from the aforementioned plants. Many pure [[active compound]]s with psychoactive properties have been isolated from these respective organisms and chemically synthesized, including [[mescaline]], [[psilocybin]], [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], [[salvinorin A]], [[ibogaine]], [[ergine]], and [[muscimol]].

Semi-synthetic (e.g., [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]) and synthetic drugs (e.g., [[Dipropyltryptamine|DPT]] and [[2C-B]] used by the [[Sangoma]]) have also been developed. Alexander Shulgin developed hundreds of entheogens in [[PiHKAL]]  and [[TiHKAL]]. Most of the drugs in PiHKAL are synthetic.

====Religious movements====
Entheogens used by movements includes biotas like [[peyote]] ([[Native American Church]]), extracts like [[Ayahuasca]] ([[Santo Daime]], [[União do Vegetal]]), the semi-synthetic drug [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] ([[Neo-American Church]]), and synthetic drugs like [[Dipropyltryptamine|DPT]] ([[Temple of the True Inner Light]]) and [[2C-B]] ([[Sangoma]]&lt;ref name="2cb-Sangoma-evolver"&gt;{{cite web |title=2CB chosen over traditional entheogens by South African healers |url=http://evolver.civicactions.net/user/chen_cho_dorge/blog/2cb_chosen_over_traditional_entheogens_south_african_healers |author=Chen Cho Dorge |publisher=Evolver.net |date=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Both Santo Daime and União do Vegetal now have members and churches throughout the world.

[[Image:2cb pill.jpg|thumb|right|[[2C-B]] is an [[entactogen]] commonly used at public places, like rave parties.]]

====Psychedelic therapy====
Psychedelic therapy refers to therapeutic practices involving the use of psychedelic drugs, particularly serotonergic psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin, DMT, mescaline, and 2C-i, primarily to assist [[psychotherapy]].

[[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies|MAPS]] has pursued a number of other research studies examining the effects of psychedelics administered to human subjects. These studies include, but are not limited to, studies of Ayahuasca, DMT, ibogaine, ketamine, LSA, LSD, [[Methylenedioxyethylamphetamine|MDE]], MDMA, mescaline, peyote, psilocybin, ''Salvia divinorum'' and conducted multi-drug studies as well as cross cultural and meta-analysis research.&lt;ref name="maps-research"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.maps.org/research/ |title=Psychedelic Research Around the World |publisher=Maps.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol===

====Ancient religions====
[[File:Michelangelo Bacchus.jpg|200px|thumb|right| [[Dionysos]], or Bacchus, was known as the [[God (male deity)|god]] of wine and ritual madness in [[Greek mythology]] ([[Bacchus (Michelangelo)|''Bacchus'']] by [[Michelangelo]] 1497).]]
{{Main|Drinking culture|religion and alcohol}}
Alcohol has sometimes been invested with [[Religion|religious]] significance.

; Celtic polytheism

In [[Celtic polytheism|ancient Celtic religion]], [[Sucellus]] or Sucellos was the [[god]] of [[agriculture]], [[forest]]s and [[Alcoholic beverage|alcoholic drinks]] of the Gauls.

; Ancient Mesopotamian religion

[[Ninkasi]] is the ancient [[Sumer]]ian [[Patron god|tutelary goddess]] of [[beer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beerchurch.com/beer-info/beer-history/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629064244/http://www.beerchurch.com/beer-info/beer-history/ |archivedate=29 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Dionysian Mysteries

In the ancient [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greco-Roman religion]], [[Dionysus|Dionysos]] (or Bacchus) was the [[God (male deity)|god]] of the grape harvest, [[winemaking]] and [[wine]], of ritual madness and [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]], of merry making and [[Bread and circuses|theatre]]. The original rite of Dionysus is associated with a wine cult and he may have been worshipped as early as c. 1500–1100 BC by [[Mycenean Greeks]]. The [[Dionysian Mysteries]] were a [[ritual]] of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] which used [[intoxicant]]s and other trance-inducing techniques (like dance and music) to remove inhibitions and social constraints, liberating the individual to return to a natural state. In his Laws, [[Plato]] said that alcoholic drinking parties should be the basis of any educational system, because the alcohol allows relaxation of otherwise fixed views. ''[[The Symposium]]'' (literally, 'drinking together') was a dramatised account of a drinking party where the participants debated the nature of love.

In the [[Homeric Hymn]] to [[Demeter]], a cup of wine is offered to Demeter which she refuses, instead insisting upon a potion of barley, water, and glechon, known as the ceremonial drink Kykeon, an essential part of the Mysteries.  The potion has been hypothesized to be an ergot derivative from barley, similar to [[LSD]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Road to Eleusis: Unveiling the Secret of the Mysteries'', by [[R. Gordon Wasson]], [[Albert Hofmann]], and [[Carl A. P. Ruck]].{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Osiris

Egyptian pictographs clearly show wine as a finished product around 4000 BC. Osiris, the god who invented beer and brewing, was worshiped throughout the country. The ancient Egyptians made at least 24 types of wine and 17 types of beer. These beverages were used for pleasure, nutrition, rituals, medicine, and payments. They were also stored in the tombs of the deceased for use in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://invent.answers.com/history/the-history-of-alcohol |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407100318/http://invent.answers.com/history/the-history-of-alcohol |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Osiris|Osirian Mysteries]] paralleled the Dionysian, according to contemporary Greek and Egyptian observers. [[Spirit possession]] involved liberation from civilization's rules and constraints. It celebrated that which was outside civilized society and a return to the source of being, which would later assume mystical overtones. It also involved escape from the socialized personality and ego into an ecstatic, deified state or the primal herd (sometimes both).

; Paganism

Some scholars{{who|date=June 2014}} have postulated that [[paganism|pagan]] religions actively promoted alcohol and [[Alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]] as a means of fostering [[fertility]]. Alcohol was believed to increase sexual desire and make it easier to approach another person for [[Alcohol and sex|sex]].

====Modern religions====
{{main|Christianity and alcohol|alcohol in the Bible|Islam and alcohol}}

; Esoteric Buddhism
[[Chögyam Trungpa|Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche]] introduced "Mindful Drinking" to the West when he fled Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rinzler|first1=Lodro|title=Buddhism and Alcohol: Is There Such a Thing as 'Right Drinking'?|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/lodro-rinzler/buddhism-and-alcohol-what_b_695369.html|work=Huffington Post|date=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mindful Drinking? (Vajrayana tradition: Alcohol &amp; Buddhism)|journal=Elephant Journal|url=https://www.elephantjournal.com/2009/03/mindful-drinking-vajrayana-tradition-alcohol-and-buddhism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Christianity

Many [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]] use wine in the [[Eucharist]] or [[Mass (liturgy)|Communion]] and permit alcohol consumption in moderation. Other denominations use unfermented grape juice in Communion; they either voluntarily abstain from alcohol or prohibit it outright.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

; Judaism

[[Judaism]] uses wine on [[Shabbat]] and some [[Jewish holidays|holidays]] for [[Kiddush]] as well as more extensively in the [[Passover]] ceremony and other religious ceremonies. The secular consumption of alcohol is allowed. Some [[Jew]]ish texts, e.g., the [[Talmud]], encourage moderate drinking on holidays (such as [[Purim]]) in order to make the occasion more joyous.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

; Bahá'í Faith
[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] are forbidden to drink [[alcohol]] or to take drugs, unless prescribed by doctors.  Accordingly, the sale and trafficking of such substances is also forbidden.  Smoking is discouraged but not prohibited.

==Usage==

===Use and abuse===
{{see also|Plastic shaman}}

Entheogens have been used by individuals to pursue spiritual goals such as [[divination]], [[ego death]], [[egolessness]], [[faith healing]], [[psychedelic therapy]] and [[spiritual formation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why I Do Psychedelics|url=http://www.jonathontwiz.com/2015/01/24/why-i-do-psychedelics/|publisher=www.jonathontwiz.com|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Don Alejandro (a Mazatecan shaman) taught me that the visionary experiences are much more important than the plants and drugs that produce them. He no longer needed to take the vision-inducing plants for his journeys."&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/TheEntheogenReviewComplete19922008/The%20Entheogen%20Review%20Complete%20(1992-2008)_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are also instances where people have been given entheogens without their knowledge or consent (e.g., tourists in Ayahuasca),&lt;ref name="mensjournal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hearn |first=Kelly |url=http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/the-dark-side-of-ayahuasca-20130215 |title=The Dark Side of Ayahuasca |publisher=[[Men's Journal]] |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as attempts to use such drugs in other contexts, such as [[Curse|cursing]], [[psychochemical weaponry]], [[psychological torture]], [[brainwashing]] and [[mind control]]; CIA experiments with LSD were used in [[Project MKUltra]], and [[#Controversial entheogens|controversial entheogens]] like alcohol are often mentioned in context of [[bread and circuses]].

=== Religious use ===
{{See also|Psychology of religion}}

==== Black magic ====
{{main|Black magic#Shamanism}}

In some areas, there are purported [[malevolent sorcerer]]s who masquerade as real shamans and who entice tourists to drink ayahuasca in their presence. Shamans believe one of the purposes for this is to steal one's energy and/or power, of which they believe every person has a limited stockpile.&lt;ref name="Campos 2011"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Shaman &amp; Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms|last=Campos|first=Don Jose|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Peyotism ====
[[File:Peyote Drummer.jpg|thumb|right|A Native American Peyote Drummer (c. 1927)]]

The [[Native American Church]] (NAC) is also known as ''Peyotism'' and ''Peyote Religion''. Peyotism is a [[Native American religion]] characterized by mixed traditional as well as [[Protestant]] beliefs and by sacramental use of the entheogen [[peyote]].

The Peyote Way Church of God believe that "Peyote is a holy sacrament, when taken according to our sacramental procedure and combined with a holistic lifestyle".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peyoteway.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prohibition ====
Some religions forbid, discourage, or restrict the drinking of alcoholic beverages. These include [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the [[Church of Christ, Scientist]], the [[United Pentecostal Church International]], [[Theravada]], most [[Mahayana]] schools of [[Buddhism]], some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations of [[Christianity]], some sects of [[Taoism]] ([[Five Precepts (Taoism)|Five Precepts]] and [[Ten Precepts (Taoism)|Ten Precepts]]), and [[Hinduism]].

The [[Pali Canon]], the scripture of [[Theravada Buddhism]], depicts refraining from alcohol as essential to moral conduct because intoxication causes a loss of [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]]. The fifth of the [[Five Precepts]] states, "''Surā-meraya-majja-pamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.''" In English: "I undertake to refrain from meraya and majja (the two fermented drinks used in the place and time of writing) to heedless intoxication." Although the Fifth Precept only names a specific wine and cider, this has traditionally been interpreted to mean all alcoholic beverages. Technically, this prohibition does also not even include light to moderate drinking, only to the point of drunkenness. It also doesn't include other mind-altering drugs, but Buddhist tradition includes all intoxicants. The canon does not suggest that alcohol is evil but believes that the carelessness produced by intoxication creates bad karma. Therefore, any drug (beyond tea or mild coffee) that affects one's mindfulness be considered by some to be covered by this prohibition.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==== Judaism and Christianity ====
Many [[Christian]] denominations disapprove of the use of most illicit drugs. The early history of the Church, however, was filled with a variety of drug use, recreational and otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;The Chemical Muse: Drug Use and the Roots of Western Civilization by D. C.A. Hillman Ph.D.{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary advocate of a religious use of cannabis plant in early Judaism was [[Sula Benet]], also called [[Sara Benetowa]], a Polish anthropologist, who claimed in 1967 that the plant ''kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם'' mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the [[holy anointing oil]] of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Robinson, The Great Book of Hemp, Health &amp; Fitness, 1995, pg. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church confirmed it as a possible valid interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_spirit2.shtml|title=Marijuana and the Bible= Erowid.org|date=2002-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by [[Michael Zohary]] (1985), [[Hans Arne Jensen]] (2004) and [[James A. Duke]] (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either ''[[Acorus calamus]]'' or ''[[Cymbopogon citratus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lytton J. Musselman ''Figs, dates, laurel, and myrrh: plants of the Bible and the Quran'' 2007 pg. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Kaneh-bosm is listed as an incense in the [[Old Testament]].

Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]] (founder of [[Jewish Renewal]]) and [[Richard Alpert]] (later known as Ram Dass) were influential early Jewish explorers of the connections between hallucinogenics and spirituality, from the early 1960s onwards.

It is generally held by academics specializing in the archaeology and paleobotany of [[Ancient Israel]], and those specializing in the lexicography of the [[Hebrew Bible]] that cannabis is not documented or mentioned in early Judaism. Against this some popular writers have argued that there is evidence for religious use of cannabis in the Hebrew Bible,&lt;ref&gt;Dan Merkur ''The Mystery of Manna: The Psychedelic Sacrament of the Bible'' (2001){{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James D. Dure, ''Manna Magic Mushroom of Moses : Manna Botanical I.D. of a Biblical Sacrament'' (self published, 2000){{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., [[John Allegro]] in relation to [[Qumran]], 1970) have been "widely dismissed as erroneous, others continue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merlin|first=M. D.|title=COVER ARTICLE: Archaeological Evidence for the Tradition of Psychoactive Plant Use in the Old World|journal=Economic Botany|volume=57|issue=3|pages=295–323|doi=10.1663/0013-0001(2003)057[0295:AEFTTO]2.0.CO;2|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Living Torah]]'', cannabis may have been one of the ingredients of the [[holy anointing oil]] mentioned in various sacred [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Aryeh. (1981). ''The Living Torah'' New York. p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt; The herb of interest is most commonly known as ''kaneh-bosm'' (Hebrew: קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם). This is mentioned several times in the [[Old Testament]] as a bartering material, [[Religious use of incense|incense]], and an ingredient in holy anointing oil used by the high priest of the temple. Although Chris Bennett's research in this area focuses on cannabis, he mentions evidence suggesting use of additional visionary plants such as henbane, as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1550567985 Sex, Drugs, Violence and the Bible], by Chris Bennett and Neil McQueen, 2001, Forbidden Fruit Publishing.{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Septuagint]] translates ''kaneh-bosm'' as [[Sweet flag|calamus]], and this translation has been propagated unchanged to most later translations of the old testament. However, [[Poland|Polish]] anthropologist [[Sula Benet]] published [[etymology|etymological]] arguments that the [[Aramaic]] word for hemp can be read as ''kannabos'' and appears to be a [[cognate]] to the modern word 'cannabis',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.njweedman.com/kanehbosm.html |title=kanehbosm |publisher=Njweedman.com |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the root ''kan'' meaning reed or hemp and ''bosm'' meaning fragrant. Both cannabis and calamus are fragrant, reedlike plants containing [[psychotropic]] compounds.

In his research, Professor [[Dan Merkur]] points to significant evidence of an awareness within the Jewish mystical tradition recognizing [[manna]] as an entheogen, thereby substantiating with [[rabbinic]] texts theories advanced by the superficial biblical interpretations of [[Terence McKenna]], [[R. Gordon Wasson]] and other [[ethnomycology|ethnomycologists]].

Although [[philologist]] [[John Marco Allegro]] has suggested that the self-revelation and healing abilities attributed to the figure of Jesus may have been associated with the effects of the plant medicines, this evidence is dependent on pre-[[Septuagint]] interpretation of Torah and [[Tenach]].  Allegro was the only non-Catholic appointed to the position of translating the Dead Sea scrolls. His extrapolations are often the object of scorn due to Allegro's non-mainstream theory of Jesus as a mythological personification of the essence of a "psychoactive sacrament".  Furthermore, they conflict with the position of the Catholic Church with regard to [[transubstantiation]] and the teaching involving valid matter, form, and drug — that of bread and wine (bread does not contain psychoactive drugs, but wine contains [[ethanol]]). Allegro's book [[The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross]] relates the development of language to the development of myths, religions, and cultic practices in world cultures. Allegro believed he could prove, through etymology, that the roots of [[Christianity]], as of many other religions, lay in [[fertility cult]]s, and that cult practices, such as ingesting visionary plants (or "[[psychedelics]]") to perceive the mind of God, persisted into the early [[Christian]] era, and to some unspecified extent into the 13th century with reoccurrences in the 18th century and mid-20th century, as he interprets the Plaincourault chapel's fresco to be an accurate depiction of the ritual ingestion of ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' as the Eucharist.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The historical picture portrayed by the Entheos journal is of fairly widespread use of visionary plants in early Christianity and the surrounding culture, with a gradual reduction of use of entheogens in Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entheomedia.org/Issue%20one.htm Conjuring Eden: Art and the Entheogenic Vision of Paradise] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814121831/http://www.entheomedia.org/Issue%20one.htm |date=14 August 2007 }}, by Mark Hoffman, Carl Ruck, and Blaise Staples. Entheos: The Journal of Psychedelic Spirituality, Issue No. 1, Summer, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; R.

Hoffman, Journal of Higher Criticism, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of the extent of visionary plant use throughout the history of Christian practice has barely been considered yet by academic or independent scholars. The question of whether visionary plants were used in pre-Theodosius Christianity is distinct from evidence that indicates the extent to which visionary plants were utilized or forgotten in later Christianity, including heretical or quasi- Christian groups,&lt;ref&gt;[http://entheomedia.org/Entheos_Issue_2.htm Daturas for the Virgin], José Celdrán and Carl Ruck, Entheos: The Journal of Psychedelic Spirituality, Vol. I, Issue 2, Winter, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and the question of other groups such as elites or laity within orthodox Catholic practice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1594601445 The Hidden World: Survival of Pagan Shamanic Themes in European Fairytales], by Carl Ruck, Blaise Staples, Jose Alfredo Celdran, Mark Hoffman, Carolina Academic Press, 2007{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Merkur at the [[University of Toronto]] contends that a minority of Christian hermits and mystics could possibly have used entheogens, in conjunction with [[fasting]], [[meditation]], and [[prayer]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==== Buddhism ====
[[File:Mandala_of_the_Buddhist_Deity_Chakrasamvara_LACMA_M.73.2.1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Mandala]] of the Buddhist Deity Chakrasamvara]]
According to R.C. Parker, "The use of entheogens in the [[Vajrayana]] tradition has been documented by such scholars as Ronald M Davidson, William George Stablein, Bulcsu Siklos, David B. Gray, Benoytosh Bhattacharyya, Shashibhusan Das Gupta, Francesca Fremantle, Shinichi Tsuda, David Gordon White, Rene de Nebesky-Wojkowitz, James Francis Hartzell, Edward Todd Fenner, Ian Baker, Dr. Pasang Yonten Arya and numerous others." These scholars have established entheogens were used in Vajrayana (in a limited context) as well as in Tantric [[Saivite]] traditions. The major entheogens in the Vajrayana [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]] tradition are [[cannabis]] and ''[[Datura]]'' which were used in various pills, ointments, and elixirs. Several tantras within Vajrayana specifically mention these entheogens and their use, including the Laghusamvara-tantra (aka [[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra]]), Samputa-tantra, Samvarodaya-tantra, Mahakala-tantra, Guhyasamaja-tantra, Vajramahabhairava-tantra, and the Krsnayamari-tantra.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;Parker, R.C.

Gray, The Cakrasamvara Tantra (The Discourse of Śrī Heruka): A Study and Annotated Translation.]{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been proposed by Scott Hajicek-Dobberstein that the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom was used by the Tantric Buddhist [[mahasiddha]] tradition of the 8th to 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hajicek-Dobberstein; Soma siddhas and alchemical enlightenment: psychedelic

In the West, some modern Buddhist teachers have written on the usefulness of psychedelics. The Buddhist magazine [[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review|Tricycle]] devoted their entire fall 1996 edition to this issue.&lt;ref&gt;Tricycle: Buddhism &amp; Psychedelics, Fall 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Some teachers such as [[Jack Kornfield]] have acknowledged the possibility that psychedelics could complement Buddhist practice, bring healing and help people understand their connection with everything which could lead to compassion.&lt;ref&gt;Kornfield, Jack; "Bringing Home the Dharma: Awakening Right Where You Are", excerpted at {{cite web |url=http://www.jackkornfield.com/psychedelics-antidepressants-spiritual-practice |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005190548/http://www.jackkornfield.com/psychedelics-antidepressants-spiritual-practice |archivedate=5 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}{{self-published inline|date=August 2016}}/&lt;/ref&gt; Kornfield warns however that addiction can still be a hindrance. Other teachers such as Michelle McDonald-Smith expressed views which saw entheogens as not conductive to Buddhist practice ("I don't see them developing anything").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stolaroff |first1=M.

=== Cultural use ===

Entheogens have been used in various ways, e.g., as part of established religious rituals, as aids for personal spiritual development ("plant teachers"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.kentupper.com/resources/Entheogens+$26+Education--JDEA+2003.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009175718/http://www.kentupper.com/resources/Entheogens+$26+Education--JDEA+2003.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-09 |title=Entheogens &amp; education: Exploring the potential of psychoactives as educational tools |author=Tupper, K.W. |journal=Journal of Drug Education and Awareness |year=2003 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=145–161 |issn=1546-6965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.csse.ca/CJE/Articles/FullText/CJE27-4/CJE27-4-tupper.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041229092745/http://csse.ca/CJE/Articles/FullText/CJE27-4/CJE27-4-tupper.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-12-29 |title=Entheogens and existential intelligence: The use of plant teachers as cognitive tools |author=Tupper, K.W. |journal=Canadian Journal of Education |year=2002 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=499–516 |doi=10.2307/1602247 |jstor=1602247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as recreational drugs, and for medical and therapeutic use.  The use of entheogens in human cultures is nearly ubiquitous throughout recorded history.

Naturally occurring entheogens such as [[psilocybin]] and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] (in the preparation [[ayahuasca]]), were, for the most part, discovered and used by older cultures, as part of their spiritual and religious life, as plants and agents that were respected, or in some cases revered for generations and may be a tradition that predates all modern religions as a sort of proto-religious rite.

One of the most widely used entheogens is [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[entheogenic use of cannabis]] has been used in regions such as [[China]], [[Europe]], and [[India]], and, in some cases, for thousands of years. It has also appeared as a part of religions and cultures such as the [[Rastafari movement]], the [[Sadhus]] of [[Hinduism]], the [[Scythians]], [[Sufi]] [[Islam]], and others.

==== Africa ====

The best-known entheogen-using culture of [[Africa]] is the [[Bwiti]]sts, who used a preparation of the root bark of ''[[Tabernanthe iboga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibogaine.desk.nl/fernandez.html Bwiti: An Ethnography of the Religious Imagination in Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628094315/http://www.ibogaine.desk.nl/fernandez.html |date=28 June 2006 }} by James W. Fernandez, Princeton University Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ancient Egyptians may have been using the [[Nymphaea caerulea|sacred blue lily]] plant in some of their religious rituals or just symbolically, it has been suggested that Egyptian religion once revolved around the ritualistic ingestion of the far more psychoactive ''[[Psilocybe cubensis]]'' mushroom, and that the Egyptian [[White Crown]], Triple Crown, and [[Atef]] Crown were evidently designed to represent pin-stages of this mushroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://shroomer.cz/upload/Hubicky_v_Egypte.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222064142/http://shroomer.cz/upload/Hubicky_v_Egypte.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-22 |title=The entheomycological origin of Egyptian crowns and the esoteric underpinnings of Egyptian religion |author=S.R.

==== Americas ====
{{See also|Aztec use of entheogens|Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal}}

Entheogens have played a pivotal role in the spiritual practices of most American cultures for millennia. The first American entheogen to be subject to scientific analysis was the [[peyote]] cactus (''Lophophora williamsii''). For his part, one of the founders of modern ethno-botany, the late-[[Richard Evans Schultes]] of [[Harvard University]] documented the ritual use of peyote cactus among the [[Kiowa]], who live in what became Oklahoma. While it was used traditionally by many cultures of what is now [[Mexico]], in the 19th century its use spread throughout [[North America]], replacing the deadly [[toxic]] [[Calia secundiflora|mescal bean]] (''Calia secundiflora'') who are questioned to be an entheogen at all. Other well-known entheogens used by Mexican cultures include the alcoholic [[Aztec]] sacrament, [[pulque]], ritual [[tobacco]] (known as 'picietl' to the Aztecs, and 'sikar' to the [[Maya people|Maya]] (from where the word 'cigar' derives)), [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, morning glories (''[[Ipomoea tricolor]]'' and ''[[Turbina corymbosa]]''), and ''[[Salvia divinorum]]''.

Entheogens also play an important role in contemporary religious movements such as the [[Rastafari movement]] and the [[Church of the Universe]].

''[[Datura wrightii]]'' is sacred to some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and has been used in ceremonies and [[rite of passage|rites of passage]] by Chumash, Tongva, and others. Among the Chumash, when a boy was 8 years old, his mother would give him a preparation of ''momoy'' to drink. This supposed spiritual challenge should help the boy develop the spiritual wellbeing that is required to become a man. Not all of the boys undergoing this ritual survived.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;{{cite book | author=Cecilia Garcia, James D. Adams | title=Healing with medicinal plants of the west - cultural and scientific basis for their use | publisher=Abedus Press| year=2005 | isbn=0-9763091-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Momoy'' was also used to enhance spiritual wellbeing among adults . For instance, during a frightening situation, such as when seeing a coyote walk like a man, a leaf of ''momoy'' was sucked to help keep the soul in the body.

==== Asia ====
The indigenous peoples of [[Siberia]] (from whom the term ''shaman'' was borrowed) have used ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' as an entheogen.

In [[Hinduism]], ''[[Datura stramonium]]'' and cannabis have been used in religious ceremonies, although the religious use of datura is not very common, as the primary alkaloids are strong [[deliriants]], which causes serious intoxication with unpredictable effects.

Also, the ancient drink [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], mentioned often in the [[Vedas]], appears to be consistent with the effects of an entheogen. In his 1967 book, Wasson argues that Soma was ''[[Amanita muscaria]]''. The active ingredient of Soma is presumed by some to be [[ephedrine]], an alkaloid with stimulant properties derived from the soma plant, identified as ''[[Ephedra]] pachyclada''. However, there are also [[Botanical identity of soma–haoma|arguments]] to suggest that Soma could have also been [[Harmal|Syrian rue]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', or some combination of any of the above plants.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==== Europe ====

Fermented honey, known in Northern Europe as [[mead]], was an early entheogen in [[Aegean civilization]], predating the introduction of wine, which was the more familiar entheogen of the reborn [[Dionysus]] and the [[maenad]]s. Its religious uses in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] world are bound up with the [[Bee (mythology)|mythology of the bee]].

[[Dacians]] were known to use cannabis in their religious and important life ceremonies, proven by discoveries of large clay pots with burnt cannabis seeds in ancient tombs and religious shrines. Also, local oral folklore and myths tell of ancient priests that dreamed with gods and walked in the smoke. Their names, as transmitted by [[Herodotus]], were "''[[kap-no-batai]]''" which in Dacian was supposed to mean "the ones that walk in the clouds".

The growth of Roman Christianity also saw the end of the two-thousand-year-old tradition of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], the initiation ceremony for the cult of [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]] involving the use of a drug known as [[kykeon]]. The term 'ambrosia' is used in Greek mythology in a way that is remarkably similar to the ''Soma'' of the Hindus as well.

A theory that natural occurring gases like [[ethylene]] used by inhalation may have played a role in divinatory ceremonies at [[Delphi]] in [[Classical Greece]] received popular press attention in the early 2000s, yet has not been conclusively proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ethylene/ethylene_history1.shtml |title=History : Oracle at Delphi May Have Been Inhaling Ethylene Gas Fumes |work=Ethylene Vault |publisher=Erowid.org |accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mushroom consumption is part of the culture of Europeans in general, with particular importance to [[Mushroom picking in Slavic culture|Slavic and Baltic peoples]]. Some academics consider that using [[psilocybin]]- and or [[muscimol]]-containing mushrooms was an integral part of the ancient culture of the [[Rus' people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.narkotiki.ru/research_5281.html|title=Drugs in ancient Russia - Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Middle East ====

It has been suggested that the ritual use of small amounts of [[Harmal|Syrian rue]] is an artifact of its ancient use in higher doses as an entheogen (possibly in conjunction with [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] containing acacia).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Philologist [[John Marco Allegro]] has argued in his book ''[[The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross]]'' that early Jewish and Christian cultic practice was based on the use of ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', which was later forgotten by its adherents. Allegro's hypothesis is that Amanita use was sacred knowledge kept only by high figures to hide the true beginnings of the Christian cult, seems supported by his own view that the [[Plaincourault Chapel]] shows evidence of Christian amanita use in the 13th century.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;

==== Oceania ====

In general, [[indigenous Australians]] are thought not to have used entheogens, although there is a strong barrier of secrecy surrounding Aboriginal shamanism, which has likely limited what has been told to outsiders. A plant that the Australian Aboriginals used to ingest is called ''Pitcheri'', which is said to have a similar effect to that of coca.
''Pitcheri'' was made from the bark of the shrub ''[[Duboisia myoporoides]]''. This plant is now grown commercially and is processed to manufacture an eye medication.
There are no known uses of entheogens by the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]] aside from a variant species of kava.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.entheology.org/edoto/anmviewer.asp?a=67 |title=Macropiper Excelsum - Maori Kava |publisher=Entheology.org |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natives of [[Papua New Guinea]] are known to use several species of entheogenic mushrooms (''Psilocybe'' spp, ''Boletus manicus'').&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shaman-australis.com/~benjamin-thomas/ |title=Benjamin Thomas Ethnobotany &amp; Anthropology Research Page |publisher=Shaman-australis.com |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kava]] or ''kava kava'' (''Piper Methysticum'') has been cultivated for at least 3000 years by a number of Pacific island-dwelling peoples. Historically, most [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]], many [[Melanesian]], and some [[Micronesia]]n cultures have ingested the psychoactive pulverized root, typically taking it mixed with water.  In these traditions, taking kava is believed to facilitate contact with the spirits of the dead, especially relatives and ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=edited by Yadhu N.|title=Kava from ethnology to pharmacology|year=2004|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=1420023373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable early testing of the entheogenic experience includes the [[Marsh Chapel Experiment]], conducted by physician and theology doctoral candidate, [[Walter Pahnke]], under the supervision of [[Timothy Leary]] and the [[Harvard Psilocybin Project]]. In this [[double-blind]] experiment, volunteer graduate school divinity students from the Boston area almost all claimed to have had profound religious experiences subsequent to the ingestion of pure [[psilocybin]]. In 2006, a more rigorously controlled experiment was conducted at [[Johns Hopkins University]], and yielded similar results.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance | journal = Psychopharmacology | date = 2006-07-07 | author = R.

Furthermore, scientific studies on entheogens present some significant challenges to investigators, including philosophical questions relating to [[ontology]], [[epistemology]] and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tupper|first1=Kenneth W.|last2=Labate|first2=Beatriz C.|title=Ayahuasca, Psychedelic Studies and Health Sciences: The Politics of Knowledge and Inquiry into an Amazonian Plant Brew|journal=Current Drug Abuse Reviews|volume=7|issue=2|pages=71–80|year=2014|accessdate=2015-01-12|url=http://eurekaselect.com/127467|doi=10.2174/1874473708666150107155042|pmid=25563448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal status ==

===Australia===
{{main|Dimethyltryptamine#Australia}}

Between 2011 and 2012, the [[Australian Federal Government]] was considering changes to the [[Criminal law of Australia|Australian Criminal Code]] that would classify any plants containing any amount of DMT as "controlled plants".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Consultation on implementation of model drug schedules for Commonwealth serious drug offences|url=http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Consultationsreformsandreviews_ConsultationonimplementationofmodeldrugschedulesforCommonwealthseriousdrugoffences|date=24 June 2010|publisher=[[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Australian Government, Attorney-General's Department]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107074102/http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Consultationsreformsandreviews_ConsultationonimplementationofmodeldrugschedulesforCommonwealthseriousdrugoffences|archivedate=7 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
DMT itself was already controlled under current laws. The proposed changes included other similar blanket bans for other substances, such as a ban on any and all plants containing Mescaline or Ephedrine. The proposal was not pursued after political embarrassment on realisation that this would make the official [[List of Australian floral emblems|Floral Emblem of Australia]], [[Acacia pycnantha]] (Golden Wattle), illegal. The Therapeutic Goods Administration and federal authority had considered a motion to ban the same, but this was withdrawn in May 2012 (as DMT may still hold potential entheogenic value to native and/or religious peoples).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AUSSIE DMT BAN|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/79564875/aussie-dmt-ban|publisher=connection.ebscohost.com|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In 1963 in ''[[Sherbert v. Verner]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] established the Sherbert Test, which consists of four criteria that are used to determine if an individual's right to religious free exercise has been violated by the government. The test is as follows:

For the individual, the court must determine
* whether the person has a claim involving a sincere religious belief, and
* whether the government action is a substantial burden on the person's ability to act on that belief.

If these two elements are established, then the government must prove
* that it is acting in furtherance of a "[[compelling state interest]]," and
* that it has pursued that interest in the manner least restrictive, or least burdensome, to religion.

This test was eventually all-but-eliminated in ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'' 494 U.S. 872 (1990) which held that a "neutral law of general applicability" was not subject to the test. Congress resurrected it for the purposes of federal law in the federal [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA) of 1993.

In ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'', 521 U.S. 507 (1997) RFRA was held to trespass on state sovereignty, and application of the RFRA was essentially limited to federal law enforcement. In ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal]]'', 546 U.S. 418 (2006), a case involving only federal law, RFRA was held to permit a church's use of a DMT-containing tea for religious ceremonies.

Some states have enacted [[State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts]] intended to mirror the federal RFRA's protections.

====Religious discrimination====
[[Peyote]] is listed by the United States DEA as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] controlled substance.  However, practitioners of the [[Native American Church|Peyote Way Church of God]], a [[Native American religion]], perceive the regulations regarding the use of peyote as [[Religious discrimination in the United States#Peyote usage|discriminating]], leading to religious discrimination issues regarding about the U.S. policy towards drugs. As the result of ''[[Peyote Way Church of God, Inc. v. Thornburgh]]'' the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] of 1978 was passed.  This federal statute allow the "Traditional Indian religious use of the peyote sacrament," exempting only use by Native American persons.

== Classical mythology and cults ==

Although entheogens are taboo and most of them are officially prohibited in Christian and Islamic societies, their ubiquity and prominence in the spiritual traditions of various other cultures is unquestioned. "The spirit, for example, need not be chemical, as is the case with the ivy and the olive: and yet the god was felt to be within them; nor need its possession be considered something detrimental, like drugged, hallucinatory, or delusionary: but possibly instead an invitation to knowledge or whatever good the god's spirit had to offer."&lt;ref name="Ruck and Staples"&gt;{{cite book|last=Staples|first=Danny|title=The world of classical myth : gods and goddesses, heroines and heroes|year=1994|publisher=Carolina Academic Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=0-89089-575-9|url=http://csp.org/chrestomathy/world_of.html|author2=Carl A.P. Ruck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the well-known modern examples, such as [[peyote]], [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, and [[Ipomoea tricolor|morning glories]] are from the native cultures of the Americas. However, it has also been suggested that entheogens played an important role in ancient Indo-European culture, for example by inclusion in the ritual preparations of the [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], the "pressed juice" that is the subject of Book 9 of the [[Rig Veda]]. Soma was ritually prepared and drunk by priests and initiates and elicited a paean in the ''Rig Veda'' that embodies the nature of an entheogen:

{{quote|Splendid by Law! declaring Law, truth speaking, truthful in thy works, Enouncing faith, King Soma!... O [Soma] Pavāmana (mind clarifying), place me in that deathless, undecaying world wherein the light of heaven is set, and everlasting lustre shines.... Make me immortal in that realm where happiness and transports, where joy and felicities combine...}}

The [[kykeon]] that preceded initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries is another entheogen, which was investigated (before the word was coined) by Carl Kerényi, in ''Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter.'' Other entheogens in the Ancient Near East and the Aegean include the [[Papaver somniferum|opium poppy]], [[Datura stramonium|datura]], and the unidentified "lotus" (likely the [[Nymphaea caerulea|sacred blue lily]]) eaten by the Lotus-Eaters in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]]''.

According to Ruck, Eyan, and Staples, the familiar shamanic entheogen that the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] brought knowledge of was ''[[Amanita muscaria]]''. It could not be cultivated; thus it had to be found, which suited it to a nomadic lifestyle. When they reached the world of the Caucasus and the Aegean, the Indo-Europeans encountered [[wine]], the entheogen of [[Dionysus]], who brought it with him from his birthplace in the mythical [[Nysa (mythology)|Nysa]], when he returned to claim his Olympian birthright. The Indo-European proto-Greeks "recognized it as the entheogen of Zeus, and their own traditions of shamanism, the Amanita and the 'pressed juice' of Soma — but better, since no longer unpredictable and wild, the way it was found among the [[Hyperborea]]ns: as befit their own assimilation of agrarian modes of life, the entheogen was now cultivable."&lt;ref name="Ruck and Staples" /&gt; [[Robert Graves]], in his foreword to ''The Greek Myths,'' hypothesises that the ambrosia of various pre-[[Greeks|Hellenic]] tribes was ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' (which, based on the morphological similarity of the words amanita, amrita and ambrosia, is entirely plausible) and perhaps [[psilocybin mushroom]]s of the genus ''[[Panaeolus]]''.

Amanita was [[divinity|divine]] food, according to Ruck and Staples, not something to be indulged in or sampled lightly, not something to be profaned. It was the food of the gods, their [[ambrosia]], and it mediated between the two realms. It is said that [[Tantalus]]'s crime was inviting commoners to share his [[ambrosia]].

The entheogen is believed to offer godlike powers in many traditional tales, including immortality. The failure of [[Gilgamesh]] in retrieving the plant of immortality from beneath the waters teaches that the blissful state cannot be taken by force or guile: When Gilgamesh lay on the bank, exhausted from his heroic effort, the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] came and ate the plant.

Another attempt at subverting the natural order is told in a (according to some) strangely metamorphosed myth, in which natural roles have been reversed to suit the Hellenic world-view. The Alexandrian Apollodorus relates how [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (spelled "Ge" in the following passage), Mother Earth herself, has supported the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] in their battle with the Olympian intruders. The Giants have been defeated:

{{quote|When Ge learned of this, she sought a drug that would prevent their destruction even by mortal hands. But Zeus barred the appearance of Eos (the Dawn), Selene (the Moon), and Helios (the Sun), and chopped up the drug himself before Ge could find it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca|date=Circa 2 A.D.|pages=34–39|url=http://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Gaia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Assassins===
{{main|Hashshashins#Legends and folklore}}

The legends of the [[Assassins]] had much to do with the training and instruction of Nizari ''fida'is'', famed for their public missions during which they often gave their lives to eliminate adversaries.

The tales of the ''fida'is''' training collected from anti-Ismaili historians and orientalists writers were confounded and compiled in Marco Polo's account, in which he described a "secret garden of paradise".{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} After being drugged, the Ismaili devotees were said to be taken to a paradise-like garden filled with attractive young maidens and beautiful plants in which these ''fida'is'' would awaken. Here, they were told by an old man that they were witnessing their place in Paradise and that should they wish to return to this garden permanently, they must serve the Nizari cause.&lt;ref name="Secret Order"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hodgson | first1 = Marshall G.S. | authorlink1 = Marshall Hodgson | title = The Secret Order of Assassins: The Struggle of the Early Nizârî Ismâʻîlîs Against the Islamic World | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 2005 | location = Philadelphia | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GU7uAAAAMAAJ | accessdate = September 15, 2010 | isbn = 978-0-8122-1916-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; So went the tale of the "Old Man in the Mountain", assembled by Marco Polo and accepted by [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]] (1774–1856), a prominent orientalist writer responsible for much of the spread of this legend. Until the 1930s, von Hammer's retelling of the Assassin legends served as the standard account of the Nizaris across Europe.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

== Literature ==
Many works of literature have described entheogen use; some of those are:
* The drug [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]] (spice) in [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' universe]] acts as both an entheogen (in large enough quantities) and an addictive [[geriatric]] medicine. Control of the supply of melange was crucial to the Empire, as it was necessary for, among other things, [[faster than light|faster-than-light]] (folding space) navigation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* Consumption of the imaginary [[mushroom]] ''anochi'' [enoki] as the entheogen underlying the creation of Christianity is the premise of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s last novel, ''[[The Transmigration of Timothy Archer]]'', a theme that seems to be inspired by John Allegro's book.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* Aldous Huxley's final novel, ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), depicted a fictional [[psychoactive mushroom]] — termed "[[moksha]] medicine" — used by the people of Pala in rites of passage, such as the transition to adulthood and at the end of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gunesekera|first1=Romesh|title=Book Of A Lifetime: Island, By Aldous Huxley|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/book-of-a-lifetime-island-by-aldous-huxley-6295203.html|website=Independent UK|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 2779438 | pmid=17486431 | doi=10.1007/s11019-007-9059-1 | volume=10 | title=Brave New World versus Island--utopian and dystopian views on psychopharmacology | journal=Med Health Care Philos | pages=119–28 | last1 = Schermer | first1 = MH}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bruce Sterling]]'s ''[[Holy Fire (novel)|Holy Fire]]'' novel refers to the religion in the future as a result of entheogens, used freely by the population.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* In [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger]]'', Book 1 of ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' series, the main character receives guidance after taking [[mescaline]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* The [[Alastair Reynolds]] novel ''[[Absolution Gap]]'' features a moon under the control of a religious government that uses neurological viruses to induce religious faith.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* A critical examination of the ethical and societal implications and relevance of "entheogenic" experiences can be found in [[Daniel Waterman]] and [[Casey William Hardison]]'s book ''Entheogens, Society &amp; Law: Towards a Politics of Consciousness, Autonomy and Responsibility'' (Melrose, Oxford 2013). This book includes a controversial analysis of the term entheogen arguing that Wasson et al. were mystifying the effects of the plants and traditions it refers to.
* The book ''Orange Sunshine and the Psychedelic Sunrise'' covers the continuum of life to death experiences from a personal and existential perspective, with an emphasis on spiritual transcendence: a psychedelic experience.

'''Fratricidins''' are antibodies that employ receptor [[pleiotropism]] to transform tumor cells into natural killer cells that destroy other tumor cells. In 2015 the effect was demonstrated by Dr. Richard A. Lerner of [[The Scripps Research Institute]] on human [[acute myeloid leukemia]] (AML) cells.&lt;ref name=ali&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scientists Have Found A Way To Make Cancer Cells Kill Each Other |first=Ali|last=Venosa|url = http://www.medicaldaily.com/cancer-treatment-breakthrough-researchers-engineer-way-make-leukemia-cells-kill-each-358212|website = Medical Daily|date=October 21, 2015|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas1&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Agonist antibody that induces human malignant cells to kill one another|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/10/20/1519079112|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2015-10-20|issn = 0027-8424|pmid = 26487683|pages = 201519079|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1519079112|first = Kyungmoo|last = Yea|first2 = Hongkai|last2 = Zhang|first3 = Jia|last3 = Xie|first4 = Teresa M.|last4 = Jones|first5 = Chih-Wei|last5 = Lin|first6 = Walter|last6 = Francesconi|first7 = Fulvia|last7 = Berton|first8 = Mohammad|last8 = Fallahi|first9 = Karsten|last9 = Sauer|volume=112|pmc=4653151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mode of action==

Most AML cells have the [[thrombopoietin]] (TPO) receptor. Fratricidins activate this receptor, turning as many as 80% first into [[dendritic cell]]s and then into cells that resemble natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are capable of rapidly attacking potentially dangerous pathogens and tumors even if they do not contain the [[biomarkers]] normally identified by other immune cells.&lt;ref name=ali/&gt;

These induced NK cells possessed extending tendrils that had made their way through the outer membranes of nearby AML cells. The antibody-induced killer cells make large amounts of [[perforin]], [[IFN-γ]] and [[granzyme B]], in a different cascade from that caused by the "normal" antibody for this receptor.&lt;ref name=pnas1/&gt;

In lab tests, a “modest” number of NK cells took out about 15 percent of the surrounding leukemic cell population in 24 hours. These cells attacked only related leukemia cells, but not unrelated [[breast cancer]] cells.&lt;ref name=ali/&gt;

A '''generation ship''', or generation starship, is a hypothetical type of [[interstellar ark]] [[starship]] that travels at sub-[[speed of light|light speed]].

Since such a ship might take centuries to thousands of years to reach even nearby stars, the original occupants of a generation ship would grow old and die, leaving their descendants to continue traveling.

== Origin ==
The concept of a generation starship is a good example of how science and fiction influence each other. Many space scientists and engineers who contributed to the concept of a generation starship were also [[science fiction]] writers.&lt;ref name="CAROTI"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simone Caroti|title=The Generation Starship in Science Fiction: A Critical History, 1934-2001|publisher=McFarland|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7864-6067-0|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the earliest description of a generation ship is in the 1929 essay "The World, The Flesh, &amp; The Devil" by [[John Desmond Bernal|J. D. Bernal]].&lt;ref name="BERNAL" /&gt;

[[Robert H. Goddard]], the rocket pioneer, was the first to write about very long duration interstellar journeys in his "The Last Migration" (1918).&lt;ref group=note&gt;The maximum speed of generation starships was marked, in 1905, when [[Albert Einstein]] published his "[[Special relativity|Special theory of relativity]]" and defined the maximum speed in the universe to be the speed of light known as ''The Principle of Invariant Light Speed''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this he described the death of the Sun and the necessity of an "interstellar ark". The crew would face the centuries of travel by [[cryo sleep|sleeping]] and would be awakened when they reached another star system.

[[Tsiolkovsky|Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky]], father of [[Astronautics|astronautic theory]], first described the need for multiple generations of passengers in his essay, "The Future of Earth and Mankind" (1928), a space colony equipped with engines that travels thousands of years which he called "Noah's Ark".

Bernal's essay was the first publication to reach the public and influence other writers. He wrote about the concept of human evolution and mankind's future in space through methods of living that we now describe as a generation starship, and which could be seen in the generic word "globes".&lt;ref name="BERNAL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bactra.org/Bernal/|title=The World, the Flesh &amp; the Devil - An Enquiry into the Future of the Three Enemies of the Rational Soul|author=J.

The [[Enzmann starship]] is categorised as "slow boat" because of the ''[[Astronomy Magazine]]'' title “Slow Boat to Centauri” (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BISEnzmann-Talk-2011kflong.pdf|title= The Enzmann Starship: History &amp; Engineering Appraisal|author= K.F.Long, A.Crowl, R.Obousy|accessdate= 7 February 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130124211710/http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BISEnzmann-Talk-2011kflong.pdf|archivedate= 24 January 2013|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Matloff's concept is called a "colony ship" and [[Alan Bond (engineer)|Alan Bond]] called his concept a "world ship".&lt;ref name="HEIN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2111006/A.M._Hein_M._Pak_D._Putz_C._Buhler_P._Reiss_World_Ships_-_Architecture_and_Feasibility_Revisited_|title=World Ships – Architectures &amp; Feasibility Revisited |author=Hein, Andreas|accessdate = 7 February 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obstacles==

===Biosphere===
Such a ship would have to be entirely [[biosphere|self-sustaining]], providing [[life support system|energy, food, air, and water]] for everyone on board. It must also have extraordinarily reliable systems that could be maintained by the ship's inhabitants over long periods of time. This would require testing whether thousands of humans could survive on their own before sending them beyond the reach of help. There are also the concerns of immune systems gradually  [[atrophy|atrophying]] over time in the ship's environment. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Small artificial closed [[ecosystems]], such as the [[Biosphere 2]], have been built in an attempt to work out the engineering difficulties in such a system, with mixed results. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motherboard.vice.com:80/blog/biosphere-2-how-a-sci-fi-stunt-turned-into-the-worlds-biggest-earth-science-lab |title=Biosphere 2: How a Sci-Fi Stunt Turned Into the World's Biggest Earth Science Lab |last=Merchant |first=Brian |date=June 10, 2013 |website=Motherboard |publisher=Vice Media LLC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819124432/http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/biosphere-2-how-a-sci-fi-stunt-turned-into-the-worlds-biggest-earth-science-lab |archive-date=August 19, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology and society===
Generation ships would have to anticipate possible biological, social and morale problems,&lt;ref name="Malik20020319"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malik|first1=Tariq|title=Sex and Society Aboard the First Starships|url=http://beyond-earth.blogspot.com/2005/01/sex-and-society-aboard-first-starships.html|website=Space Adventures|accessdate=13 February 2015|date=27 January 2005}} ''[Original reference is [http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/star_voyage_020319-1.html dead link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020407132242/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/star_voyage_020319-1.html |date=2002-04-07 }}: Space.com, 19 March 2002.]''&lt;/ref&gt; and would also need to deal with matters of self-worth and purpose for the various crews involved. As an example, a moral quandary exists regarding how intermediate generations, those destined to be born and die in transit without actually seeing tangible results of their efforts, might feel about their forced existence on such a ship.

Estimates of the minimum reasonable population for a generation ship vary. Anthropologist John Moore has estimated that, even in the absence of cryonics or sperm banks, a population capacity of 160 people would allow normal family life (with the average individual having ten potential marriage partners) throughout a 200-year space journey, with little loss of genetic diversity; social engineering can reduce this estimate to 80 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn1936 |title="Magic number" for space pioneers calculated |date=15 February 2002 |author=Damian Carrington |work=NewScientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 anthropologist Cameron Smith reviewed existing literature and created a new computer model to estimate a minimum reasonable population in the tens of thousands. Smith's numbers were much larger than previous estimates such as Moore's, in part because Smith takes the risk of accidents and disease into consideration, and assumes at least one severe population catastrophe over the course of a 150-year journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576513004669|title=Smith, C.M., "Estimation of a genetically viable population for multigenerational interstellar voyaging: Review and data for project Hyperion" |publisher=ScienceDirect |date=2013-12-13 |accessdate=2013-02-18 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2013.12.013|bibcode=2014AcAau..97...16S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of the multiple generations that it could take to reach even our nearest neighboring star systems such as [[Proxima Centauri]], further issues on the viability of such interstellar arks include:

* the possibility of humans dramatically evolving in directions unacceptable to the sponsors
* the minimum population required to maintain in isolation a culture acceptable to the sponsors; this could include such aspects as
** ability to maintain and operate the ship
** ability to accomplish the purpose (planetary colonization, research, building new interstellar arks) contemplated
** sharing the values of the sponsors, which may not be likely to be empirically demonstrated to be viable beyond the home planet unless, once the ship is away from Earth and on its way, survival of one's offspring until the ship reaches the target star is one motivation.

===Social breakdown===
Generation ships travelling for long periods of time may see breakdowns in social structures. Changes in society (for example, [[mutiny]]) could occur over such periods and may prevent the ship from reaching its destination. This state was described by [[Algis Budrys]] in a 1966 book review:&lt;ref name="budrys196608"&gt;{{Cite magazine

{{quote|The slower-than-light interstellar spaceship, pursuing its way through the weary centuries, its crew losing touch with all reality save the interior of the vessel ... Well, you know the story, and its unhappy downhill round, its exciting struggles between the barbarian tribes which develop in its disparate compartments, and then, if the writer is so minded, the ultimate flash of hope as the good guys win out and prepare to meet their future on some noble, if erroneous basis.}}

[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Orphans of the Sky]]'' (the "impeccable statement of this theme", Budrys said){{r|budrys196608}} and [[Brian Aldiss]]'s [[Non-Stop (novel)|''Non-Stop'']] (U.S. title ''Starship'') discussed such societies.

===Cosmic rays===
{{Main article|Health threat from cosmic rays}}

The radiation environment of deep space is very different from that on the Earth's surface, or in low earth orbit, due to the much larger influx of high-energy [[galactic cosmic rays]] (GCRs). Like other [[ionizing radiation]], high-energy cosmic rays can damage [[DNA]], increase the risk of cancer, cataracts, neurological disorders, and non-cancerous mortality risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/factsheets/pdfs/radiation.pdf |title=NASA Facts: Understanding Space Radiation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One known practical solution to this problem is surrounding the crewed parts of the ship with a thick enough shielding such as a thick layer of maintained ice as proposed in ''[[The Songs of Distant Earth]]'', a [[science fiction]] novel by [[Arthur C. Clarke|Arthur&amp;nbsp;C. Clarke]] (note: in this book the ship's mammoth ice shield is only in the forward part of the ship, preventing micrometeors from damaging the ship during its interstellar journey).

===Technological progress===
{{main article|Wait calculation}}
If a generation ship is sent to a star system 20 light years away, and is expected to reach its destination in 200 years, a better ship may be later developed that can reach it in 50 years. Thus, the first generation ship may find a century-old human colony after its arrival at its destination.

'''Generative adversarial networks''' ('''GANs''') are a class of [[artificial intelligence]] algorithms used in [[unsupervised machine learning]], implemented by a system of two [[neural network]]s contesting with each other in a [[zero-sum game]] framework. They were introduced by [[Ian Goodfellow]] ''et al.'' in 2014.&lt;ref name="GANs"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1406.2661|title=Generative Adversarial Networks|first1=Ian |last1=Goodfellow |first2=Jean |last2=Pouget-Abadie |first3=Mehdi |last3=Mirza |first4=Bing |last4=Xu |first5=David |last5=Warde-Farley |first6=Sherjil |last6=Ozair |first7=Aaron |last7=Courville |first8=Yoshua |last8=Bengio |class=cs.LG |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This technique can generate photographs that look at least superficially authentic to human observers, having many realistic characteristics (though in tests people can tell real from generated in many cases).&lt;ref name="ITT_GANs"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1606.03498|title=Improved Techniques for Training GANs|last1=Salimans |first1=Tim |last2=Goodfellow |first2=Ian |last3=Zaremba |first3=Wojciech |last4=Cheung |first4=Vicki |last5=Radford |first5=Alec |last6=Chen |first6=Xi |class=cs.LG |year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
One network [[Generative model|generates]] candidates (generative) and the other [[Discriminative model|evaluates them]] (discriminative).&lt;ref name="MyUser_Arxiv.org_April_7_2016c"&gt;{{cite arXiv|class=stat.ML|first2=Jean|last2=Pouget-Abadie|title=Generative Adversarial Networks|eprint=1406.2661|last1=Goodfellow|first1=Ian J.|last3=Mirza|first3=Mehdi|last4=Xu|first4=Bing|last5=Warde-Farley|first5=David|last6=Ozair|first6=Sherjil|last7=Courville|first7=Aaron|last8=Bengio|first8=Yoshua|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DAGUI"&gt;Thaler, SL, US Patent 05659666, Device for the autonomous generation of useful information, 08/19/1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DABUI"&gt;Thaler, SL, US Patent, 07454388, Device for the autonomous bootstrapping of useful information, 11/18/2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia of creativity"&gt;Thaler, SL, The Creativity Machine Paradigm, Encyclopedia of Creativity, Invention, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship, (ed.) E.G. Carayannis, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the generative network learns to map from a [[Latent variable|latent space]] to a particular data distribution of interest, while the discriminative network discriminates between instances from the true data distribution and candidates produced by the generator. The generative network's training objective is to increase the error rate of the discriminative network (i.e., "fool" the discriminator network by producing novel synthesised instances that appear to have come from the true data distribution).&lt;ref name="MyUser_Arxiv.org_April_7_2016c" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luc|first=Pauline|last2=Couprie|first2=Camille|last3=Chintala|first3=Soumith|last4=Verbeek|first4=Jakob|date=2016-11-25|title=Semantic Segmentation using Adversarial Networks|journal=NIPS Workshop on Adversarial Training, Dec , Barcelona, Spain|volume=2016|arxiv=1611.08408|bibcode=2016arXiv161108408L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, a known dataset serves as the initial training data for the discriminator. Training the discriminator involves presenting it with samples from the dataset, until it reaches some level of accuracy. Typically the generator is seeded with a randomized input that is sampled from a predefined latent space&lt;ref name = "DAGUI"/&gt; (e.g. a [[multivariate normal distribution]]). Thereafter, samples synthesized by the generator are evaluated by the discriminator. [[Backpropagation]] is applied in both networks &lt;ref name = "DABUI"/&gt; so that the generator produces better images, while the discriminator becomes more skilled at flagging synthetic images.&lt;ref name="OpenAI_com"&gt;{{citation |url=http://openai.com/blog/generative-models/ |title=Generative Models |publisher=[[OpenAI]] |date=  |authors=[[Andrej Karpathy]], [[Pieter Abbeel]], Greg Brockman, Peter Chen, Vicki Cheung, Rocky Duan, Ian Goodfellow, Durk Kingma, Jonathan Ho, Rein Houthooft, Tim Salimans, John Schulman, Ilya Sutskever, And Wojciech Zaremba|accessdate= April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The generator is typically a deconvolutional neural network, and the discriminator is a [[convolutional neural network]].

The idea to infer models in a competitive setting (model versus discriminator) was proposed by Li, Gauci and Gross in 2013.&lt;ref name="Li-etal-GECCO2013"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models other than neural networks can be considered. Moreover, the discriminators are allowed to influence the processes from which the datasets are obtained, making them active interrogators as in the Turing test. The idea of adversarial training can also be found in earlier works, such as Schmidhuber in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidhuber|first=Jürgen|date=November 1992|title=Learning Factorial Codes by Predictability Minimization|journal=Neural Computation|language=en|volume=4|issue=6|pages=863–879|doi=10.1162/neco.1992.4.6.863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GANs have been used to produce samples of [[photorealistic]] images for the purposes of visualizing new [[interior design|interior]]/[[industrial design]], shoes, bags and [[clothing]] items or items for [[PC game|computer game]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s' scenes.{{Citation needed|reason=No source provided.

The system focused on realistic textures rather than pixel-accuracy. The result was a higher image quality at high magnification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Sajjadi|first=Mehdi S.

GANs were used to create the 2018 painting ''[[Edmond de Belamy]]'' which sold for $432,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/arts/design/ai-art-sold-christies.html | title=AI Art at Christie's Sells for $432,500| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2018-10-25| last1=Cohn| first1=Gabe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, a [[deepfake]] video of [[Donald Trump]] chastising Belgium citizens to abandon the [[Paris Agreement]] was circulated in an attempt to prioritize [[climate change]].  The video, produced using GAN technology, had been commissioned by Belgian political party [[Socialistische Partij Anders]] (sp.a) and uploaded to their [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] accounts.   Widely believed true, the video provoked hundreds of comments on social media until sp.a owned up to their forgery.&lt;ref name="schwartz-2018"&gt;

'''Gordon Wallace Scott''' (1 October 1887 &amp;ndash; 14 December 1940) was a Canadian politician.

Born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Scott appointed [[Ministry of Finance (Quebec)|Treasurer]] in the cabinet of [[Louis-Alexandre Taschereau]] on October 16, 1930. He was the unusucessful [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal]] candidate for the riding of [[Huntingdon (provincial electoral district)|Huntingdon]] in a [[by-election]] held on November 4, 1930 losing to [[Martin Fisher]]. He held the role of Treasurer until November 27. He was appointed to the [[Legislative Council of Quebec]] for Wellington on November 13, 1930 and was made a minister without portfolio as well. He resigned on August 4, 1931 to run as the Liberal candidate in the riding of [[Montréal–Saint-Georges]] in the [[Quebec general election, 1931|1931 election]]. He was defeated by [[Charles Ernest Gault]] and was re-appointed to the Legislative Council on June 17, 1932 for the Victoria division.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{QuebecMLCbio|scott-gordon-wallace-397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died while in office on December 14, 1940 during the rescue operations carried out in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] after the sinking of the steamer ''Western Prince'' by the [[German submarine U-96 (1940)|German submarine U-96]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; He was accompanying [[C. D. Howe]] to Britain to examine the British war effort and Canada's assistance to it, and was  killed trying to climb from the lifeboat to the rescuing ship (Howe survived).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8548">'''Greedy reductionism''', identified by [[Daniel Dennett]], in his 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', is a kind of erroneous [[reductionism]]. Whereas "good" reductionism means explaining a thing in terms of what it reduces to (for example, its parts and their interactions), greedy reductionism occurs when "in their eagerness for a bargain, in their zeal to explain too much too fast, scientists and philosophers ... underestimate the complexities, trying to skip whole layers or levels of theory in their rush to fasten everything securely and neatly to the foundation".&lt;ref&gt;Dennett 1995; Chapter 3, ''Universal Acid'' (p. 82)&lt;/ref&gt; Using the terminology of "cranes" (legitimate, mechanistic explanations) and "skyhooks" (essentially, fake&amp;mdash;e.g. supernaturalistic&amp;mdash;explanations) built up earlier in the chapter, Dennett recapitulates his initial definition of the term in the chapter summary on p.&amp;nbsp;83: "Good reductionists suppose that all Design can be explained without skyhooks; greedy reductionists suppose it can all be explained without cranes."

==Examples==
A canonical example of greedy reductionism, labelled as such by Dennett himself,&lt;ref&gt;Dennett 1995; Chapter 13, ''Losing our Minds to Darwin'' (p. 395)&lt;/ref&gt; is the ([[radical behaviorism|radical]]) [[behaviorism]] of [[B. F. Skinner]]. It is often said of this school of thought (which dominated the field of psychology, at least in the Anglo-American world, for part of the twentieth century) that it denied the existence of mental states such as beliefs, although at least in Skinner's original version it merely denied the theoretical utility (or necessity) of postulating such states in order to explain behavior. Notably, Skinner himself characterized his views as anti-reductionist: in ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]]'' and other works (e.g. ''About Behaviorism'' and chapter 19 of ''[[Verbal Behavior (book)|Verbal Behavior]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[[B. F. Skinner|Skinner, Burrhus Frederick]] (1957), ''[[Verbal Behavior (book)|Verbal Behavior]]'', Acton, Massachusetts: [[Copley Publishing Group]], {{ISBN|1-58390-021-7}} pp. 432-452&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote that while mental and neurological states did exist, behavior could be explained without recourse to either. As Dennett says, "Skinner proclaimed that ''one simple iteration'' of the fundamental Darwinian process&amp;mdash;[[operant conditioning]]&amp;mdash;could account for all mentality, all learning, not just in pigeons but in human beings. ... Skinner was a greedy reductionist, trying to explain ''all'' the design (and design power) in a single stroke".&lt;ref&gt;Dennett 1995; Chapter 13, ''Losing our Minds to Darwin'' (p. 395)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his earlier book ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'', Dennett argued that, without denying that human [[consciousness]] exists, we can understand it as coming about from the coordinated activity of many components in the brain that are themselves [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]. In response, critics accused him of "explaining away" consciousness because he disputes the existence of certain conceptions of consciousness that he considers overblown and incompatible with what is physically possible. This is perhaps what motivated Dennett to make the greedy/good distinction in his follow-up book, to freely admit that reductionism can go overboard while pointing out that not all reductionism goes this far.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} &lt;!--I hesitate to delete this, because it seems at least marginally plausible and at least marginally relevant, but I don't like the "too far" construction: that's not what "greedy reductionism" is supposed to be (at least not by Dennett).--&gt;

A departure from strict reductionism in the opposite direction from greedy reductionism is called nonreductive physicalism. Nonreductive physicalists deny that a reductionistic analysis of a conscious system like the human mind is sufficient to explain all of the phenomena which are characteristic of that system.  This idea is expressed in some theories that say consciousness is an [[Emergent materialism|emergent]] [[epiphenomenon]] that cannot be reduced to physiological properties of neurons. Those [[Nonreductive physicalism|nonreductive physicalists]], such as [[Colin McGinn]], who claim the true relationship between the physical and the mental may be beyond scientific understanding—and therefore a "mystery"—have been dubbed [[New Mysterianism|Mysterians]] by [[Owen Flanagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Nothing-buttery ==

An older name for 'Greedy reductionism' is "Nothing-buttery", an expression based on the repeated phrase "such-and-such is nothing but...". For example, in the article title, "Consciousness is Nothing But a Word".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schlinger|first1=Henry D.|title=Consciousness is nothing but a word|url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/08-02-27/#feature|website=eSceptic|accessdate=15 June 2017|language=English|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This 1955 example of the phrase demonstrates its use in its characteristic context:&lt;blockquote&gt;Yet one occasionally hears it said that the brain is nothing but a machine.  The assertion is usually made in a slurring tone which implies that the brain has been overrated in some unspecified way and is supposed to put an end to further discussion.  One investigator calls this "nothing buttery" thinking. It is certainly a grave insult to the brain—and to the machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfeiffer|first1=John|title=The Human Brain|date=1955|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|location=New York|page=261|url=https://archive.org/stream/humanbrain00john#page/261/mode/1up/search/buttery|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The expression began to be used in US English from 1953, and in UK English from the beginning of the 1960s.  Its usage peaked in about 1970, but the phrase continues to be used up to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=n-gram of "nothing-buttery"|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=nothing-buttery&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cnothing%20-%20buttery%3B%2Cc0|website=Google Books n-gram Viewer|publisher=Google|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related expression "nothing-but-ism" appeared earlier, in the 1930s.  One of its earliest documented uses was in a 1935 review by W. J. H. Sprott of Carl Jung's book ''Man in Search of a Soul'' in the journal ''Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/234398#eid13447194|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sprott praised Jung's book because "it does not attempt to explain away spiritual aspiration, the antithesis of 'nothing-but'-ism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sprott|first1=W. J. H.|title=Review of Religion and the Sciences of Life., ; Men and their Motives., ; Modern Man in Search of a Soul|journal=Mind|date=1935|volume=44|issue=173|page=91 |jstor=2250327|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in the 1970s the phrase "nothing-buttery" had already been in use for at least twenty years, it is often associated with the scholar Donald Mackay, who popularized its use at that time and debated publicly with B. F. Skinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danielian|first1=A.|title=Nothing Buttery|journal=New Scientist|date=1994-11-19|issue=1952|url=https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg14419526-600-nothing-buttery/|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09515089708573235 |last1=Washburn|first1=David A.|title=The MacKay‐skinner debate: A case for "nothing buttery" |journal=Philosophical Psychology|date=December 1997|volume=10|issue=4|pages=473–479|doi=10.1080/09515089708573235 |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grey goo''' (also spelled '''gray goo''') is a hypothetical [[doomsday event|end-of-the-world]] scenario involving [[molecular nanotechnology]] in which out-of-control [[self-replicating robots]] consume all biomass on [[Earth]] while building more of themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grey Goo is a Small Issue |url=http://www.crnano.org/BD-Goo.htm |date=2003-12-14 |accessdate=2009-12-28 |publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nanotechnology pioneer slays "grey goo" myths |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/06/040609072100.htm |date=2006-07-06 |accessdate=2009-12-28 |work=Nanotechnology |publisher=[[Institute of Physics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a scenario that has been called ''[[ecophagy]]'' ("eating the environment", more literally "eating the habitation").&lt;ref name="freitas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Limits to Global Ecophagy by Biovorous Nanoreplicators, with Public Policy Recommendations|first=Robert A.|last=Freitas Jr.|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/Ecophagy.htm|date=April 2000|accessdate=28 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original idea assumed machines were designed to have this capability, while popularizations have assumed that machines might somehow gain this capability by accident.

[[self-replication|Self-replicating]] machines of the macroscopic variety were originally described by mathematician [[John von Neumann]], and are sometimes referred to as [[Self-replicating machine|von Neumann machines]] or [[clanking replicator]]s.
The term ''gray goo'' was coined by nanotechnology pioneer [[K. Eric Drexler|Eric Drexler]] in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of Creation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Apocalypse 2012 |last= Joseph |first= Lawrence E. |authorlink= |year= 2007 |publisher= Broadway |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-7679-2448-1 |page= 6 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he stated, "I wish I had never used the term 'gray goo'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/429591b |pmid=15190320 |title=Nanotech takes small step towards burying 'grey goo' |year=2004 |last1=Giles |first1=Jim |journal=Nature |volume=429 |issue=6992 |pages=591|url=http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038%2F429591b}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Engines of Creation'' mentions "gray goo" in two paragraphs and a note, while the popularized idea of gray goo was first publicized in a mass-circulation magazine, ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'', in November 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metamodern.com/b/wp-content/uploads/docs/OMNI_TINYTECH.pdf Nanotechnology: Molecular Machines that Mimic Life, OMNI, Vol. 9 No. 6, November 1986, p. 56ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term was first used by molecular nanotechnology pioneer [[Eric Drexler]] in his book ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' (1986). In Chapter 4, ''Engines Of Abundance'', Drexler illustrates both [[exponential growth]] and inherent limits (not gray goo) by describing [[nanomachines]] that can function only if given special raw materials:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Imagine such a replicator floating in a bottle of chemicals, making copies of itself...the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four, and the eight build another eight. At the end of ten hours, there are not thirty-six new replicators, but over 68 billion. In less than a day, they would weigh a ton; in less than two days, they would outweigh the Earth; in another four hours, they would exceed the mass of the Sun and all the planets combined&amp;thinsp;—&amp;thinsp;if the bottle of chemicals hadn't run dry long before.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Drexler, the term was popularized by an article in science fiction magazine ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'', which also popularized the term ''nanotechnology'' in the same issue. Drexler says [[arms control]] is a far greater issue than grey goo "nanobugs".&lt;ref&gt;[https://youtube.com/watch?v=50iAoe7bs9o?t=3385 Dr Eric Drexler - Nanotechnology: The Big Picture]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] broadcast, a contrasting idea (a kind of gray goo) is referred to in a futuristic [[End time|doomsday]] scenario:
"In a common practice, billions of nanobots are released to clean up [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|an oil spill off the coast of Louisiana]]. However, due to a programming error, the nanobots devour all carbon based objects, instead of just the hydrocarbons of the oil. The nanobots destroy everything, all the while, replicating themselves. Within days, the planet is turned to dust."&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Drexler describes gray goo in Chapter 11 of ''Engines of Creation'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Early assembler-based replicators could beat the most advanced modern organisms. 'Plants' with 'leaves' no more efficient than today's solar cells could out-compete real plants, crowding the biosphere with an inedible foliage. Tough, omnivorous 'bacteria' could out-compete real bacteria: they could spread like blowing pollen, replicate swiftly, and reduce the biosphere to dust in a matter of days. Dangerous replicators could easily be too tough, small, and rapidly spreading to stop&amp;thinsp;—&amp;thinsp;at least if we made no preparation. We have trouble enough controlling viruses and fruit flies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Drexler notes that the geometric growth made possible by self-replication is inherently limited by the availability of suitable raw materials.

Drexler used the term "gray goo" not to indicate color or texture, but to emphasize the difference between "superiority" in terms of human values and "superiority" in terms of competitive success:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though masses of uncontrolled replicators need not be grey or gooey, the term "grey goo" emphasizes that replicators able to obliterate life might be less inspiring than a single species of crabgrass. They might be "superior" in an evolutionary sense, but this need not make them valuable.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Bill Joy]], one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, discussed some of the problems with pursuing this technology in his now-famous 2000 article in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, titled "[[Why the Future Doesn't Need Us]]". In direct response to Joy's concerns, the first quantitative technical analysis of the [[ecophagy]] scenario was published in 2000 by nanomedicine pioneer [[Robert Freitas]].&lt;ref name="freitas"/&gt;

==Risks and precautions==
Drexler more recently conceded that there is no need to build anything that even resembles a potential runaway replicator. This would avoid the problem entirely. In a paper in the journal ''[[Nanotechnology (journal)|Nanotechnology]]'', he argues that self-replicating machines are needlessly complex and inefficient. His 1992 technical book on advanced nanotechnologies ''[[Nanosystems|Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html |title=Nanosystems: molecular machinery, manufacturing, and computation |first=K. Eric |last=Drexler |publisher=Wiley |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-471-57518-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes manufacturing systems that are desktop-scale factories with specialized machines in fixed locations and conveyor belts to move parts from place to place. None of these measures would prevent a party from creating a weaponized grey goo, were such a thing possible.

[[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] called upon the British [[Royal Society]] to investigate the "enormous environmental and social risks" of nanotechnology in a planned report, leading to much media commentary on grey goo. The Royal Society's report on nanoscience was released on 29 July 2004, and declared the possibility of self-replicating machines to lie too far in the future to be of concern to regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm| title=Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties| publisher=The Royal Society| accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent analysis in the paper titled ''Safe Exponential Manufacturing'' from the [[Institute of Physics]] (co-written by Chris Phoenix, Director of Research of the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology, and Eric Drexler), shows that the danger of grey goo is far less likely than originally thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.crnano.org/PR-IOP.htm| date=9 June 2004| title=Leading nanotech experts put 'grey goo' in perspective| publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology| accessdate=2006-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other long-term major risks to society and the environment from nanotechnology have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.crnano.org/dangers.htm| title= Current Results of Our Research| publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology| accessdate=2006-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drexler has made a somewhat public effort to retract his grey goo hypothesis, in an effort to focus the debate on more realistic threats associated with knowledge-enabled nanoterrorism and other misuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3788673.stm| title=Nanotech guru turns back on 'goo'| publisher= BBC News|accessdate=2012-03-30|first=Paul|last=Rincon|date=2004-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Safe Exponential Manufacturing'', which was published in a 2004 issue of ''Nanotechnology'', it was suggested that creating manufacturing systems with the ability to self-replicate by the use of their own energy sources would not be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phoenix|first=Chris|author2=Eric Drexler|title=Safe Exponential Manufacturing|journal=Nanotechnology|date=August 2004|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/15/8/001 |volume=15|issue=8|pages=869–72|url=http://rachel.org/lib/safe_exponential_manufacturing.040601.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foresight Institute also recommended embedding controls in the molecular machines. These controls would be able to prevent anyone from purposely abusing nanotechnology, and therefore avoid the grey goo scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/current.html| title=Foresight Guidelines for Responsible Nanotechnology Development| publisher= Foresight Institute and IMM|accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and chaos==

Grey goo is a useful construct for considering low-probability, high-impact outcomes from emerging technologies. Thus, it is a useful tool in the [[ethics of technology]]. [[Daniel A. Vallero]] applied it as a worst-case scenario [[thought experiment]] for technologists contemplating possible risks from advancing a technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biomedical Ethics for Engineers: Ethics and Decision Making in Biomedical and Biosystem Engineering|first=Daniel|last=Vallero |publisher=Academic Press |year=2007 |isbn=9780080476100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires that a [[decision tree]] or [[event tree]] include even extremely low probability events if such events may have an extremely negative and irreversible consequence, i.e. application of the [[precautionary principle]]. Dianne Irving admonishes that "any error in science will have a rippling effect..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Science, the formation of conscience and moral decision theory|last1=Irving |first1=Dianne|journal=Proceedings of the Guadalupan Appeal: The Dignity and Status of the Human Embryo, Mexico City, Mexico|date=October 28, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vallero adapted this reference to chaos theory to emerging technologies, wherein slight permutations of initial conditions can lead to unforeseen and profoundly negative downstream effects, for which the technologist and the new technology's proponents must be held accountable.

'''Hazard analysis and critical control points''', or '''HACCP''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|s|ʌ|p}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}), is a systematic preventive approach to [[food safety]] from [[biological hazard|biological]], [[chemical hazard|chemical]], and physical hazards in production processes that can cause the finished product to be unsafe and designs measures to reduce these risks to a safe level. In this manner, HACCP attempts to avoid hazards rather than attempting to inspect finished products for the effects of those hazards. The HACCP system can be used at all stages of a food chain, from [[food processing|food production]] and preparation processes including packaging, distribution, etc. The [[United States Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) require mandatory HACCP programs for juice and meat as an effective approach to food safety and protecting public health. Meat HACCP systems are regulated by the USDA, while seafood and juice are regulated by the FDA. All other food companies in the United States that are required to register with the FDA under the [[Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act]] of 2002, as well as firms outside the US that export food to the US, are transitioning to mandatory [[hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls]] (HARPC) plans.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

HACCP is believed to stem from a production process monitoring used during [[World War II]] because traditional "end of the pipe" testing on artillery shell's firing mechanisms could not be performed, and a large percentage of the artillery shells made{{Where|date=October 2018}} at the time were either duds or misfiring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=35496 MIL-STD-105 official record] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041018035508/http://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=35496 |date=18 October 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HACCP itself was conceived in the 1960s when the US [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) asked [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] to design and manufacture the first foods for space flights. Since then, HACCP has been recognized internationally as a logical tool for adapting traditional inspection methods to a modern, science-based, food safety system. Based on risk-assessment, HACCP plans allow both industry and government to allocate their resources efficiently in establishing and auditing safe food production practices. In 1994, the organization International HACCP Alliance was established, initially to assist the US meat and poultry industries with implementing HACCP, and now its membership has been spread over other professional and industrial areas.&lt;ref name=iha&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, HACCP has been increasingly applied to industries other than food, such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. This method, which in effect seeks to plan out unsafe practices based on science, differs from traditional "produce and sort" [[quality control]] methods that do nothing to prevent hazards from occurring and must identify them at the end of the process. HACCP is focused only on the health safety issues of a product and not the quality of the product, yet HACCP principles are the basis of most food quality and safety assurance systems. In the [[United States]], HACCP compliance is regulated by [[Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations|21 CFR]] part 120 and 123. Similarly, [[FAO]] and [[WHO]] published a guideline for all governments to handle the issue in small and less developed food businesses.&lt;ref name="fgg"&gt;{{cite web

==History==
In the early 1960s, a collaborated effort between the [[Pillsbury Company]], NASA, and the U.S. Army Laboratories began with the objective to provide [[space food|safe food for space expedition]]s. People involved in this collaboration included Herbert Hollander, Mary Klicka, and Hamed El-Bisi of the [[United States Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center|United States Army Laboratories]] in [[Natick, Massachusetts]], Rev. Dr. Paul A. Lachance of the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]], and Howard E. Baumann representing Pillsbury as its lead scientist.&lt;ref name="fsm"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/magazine-archive1/december-2009january-2010/happy-50th-birthday-to-haccp-retrospective-and-prospective/ |first1=William H. |last1=Sperber |first2= Richard F. |last2=Stier. |title=Happy 50th Birthday to HACCP: Retrospective and Prospective |work=FoodSafety magazine|pages=42–46|date=December 2009|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure that the food sent to space was safe, Lachance imposed strict [[microbiology|microbial]] requirements, including [[pathogen]] limits (including ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella]]'', and ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'').&lt;ref name="fsm"/&gt; Using the traditional end product testing method, it was soon realized that almost all of the food manufactured was being used for testing and very little was left for actual use. Therefore, a new approach was needed.

NASA's own requirements for critical control points (CCP) in [[engineering management]] would be used as a guide for food safety. CCP derived from [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA) from NASA via the [[munition]]s industry to test weapon and engineering system [[reliability (engineering)|reliability]]. Using that information, NASA and Pillsbury required contractors to identify "critical failure areas" and eliminate them from the system, a first in the food industry then. Baumann, a microbiologist by training, was so pleased with Pillsbury's experience in the space program that he advocated for his company to adopt what would become HACCP at Pillsbury.&lt;ref name="fsm"/&gt;

Soon, Pillsbury was confronted with a food safety issue of its own when [[glass]] contamination was found in [[Farina (food)|farina]], a [[cereal]] commonly used in [[infant]] food. Baumann's leadership promoted HACCP in Pillsbury for producing commercial foods, and applied to its own food production. This led to a panel discussion at the 1971 National Conference on Food Protection that included examining CCPs and [[good manufacturing practice]]s in producing safe foods. Several [[botulism]] cases were attributed to under-processed low-acid [[canning|canned]] foods in 1970–71. The [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) asked Pillsbury to organize and conduct a training program on the inspection of canned foods for FDA inspectors. This 21-day program was first held in September 1972 with 11 days of classroom lecture and 10 days of canning plant evaluations.&lt;ref name="fsm"/&gt; Canned food regulations ([[Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations|21]] [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] 108, 21 CFR 110, 21 CFR 113, and 21 CFR 114)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/Product-SpecificInformation/AcidifiedLow-AcidCannedFoods/Regulations/default.htm FDA.gov Regulations on acidified and low-acid canned foods.] – accessed 10 January 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227115527/http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/Product-SpecificInformation/AcidifiedLow-AcidCannedFoods/Regulations/default.htm |date=27 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were first published in 1969. Pillsbury's training program to the FDA in 1969, titled "Food Safety through the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point System", was the first time that HACCP was used.&lt;ref name="fsm"/&gt;

HACCP was initially set on three principles, now shown as principles one, two, and four in the section below. Pillsbury quickly adopted two more principles, numbers three and five, to its own company in 1975. It was further supported by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) that governmental inspections by the FDA go from reviewing plant records to compliance with its HACCP system. A second proposal by the NAS led to the development of the [[National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods]] (NACMCF) in 1987. NACMCF was initially responsible for defining HACCP's systems and guidelines for its application and were coordinated with the Codex Committee for Food Hygiene, that led to reports starting in 1992 and further harmonization in 1997. By 1997, the seven HACCP principles listed below became the standard.&lt;ref name="fsm"/&gt; A year earlier, the [[American Society for Quality]] offered their first certifications for HACCP Auditors.&lt;ref&gt;Newcomb, William O. "ASQ Certification: A Brief History". ''Quality Progress''. January 2010. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; (First known as Certified Quality Auditor-HACCP, they were changed to Certified HACCP Auditor (CHA) in 2004.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asq.org/pdf/certification/inserts/cha-insert-2006.pdf American Society for Quality Certified HACCP Auditor brochure.] – accessed 9 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

HACCP expanded in all realms of the food industry, going into meat, poultry, seafood, dairy, and has spread now from the farm to the fork.&lt;ref name="fsm"/&gt;

==Principles==

#Conduct a hazard analysis
#:Plan to determine the food safety hazards and identify the preventive measures the plan can apply to control these hazards. A food safety hazard is any biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption.
#Identify critical control points
#:A [[critical control point]] (CCP) is a point, step, or procedure in a food manufacturing process at which control can be applied and, as a result, a food safety hazard can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to an acceptable level.
#Establish critical limits for each critical control point
#:A critical limit is the maximum or minimum value to which a physical, biological, or chemical hazard must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce that hazard to an acceptable level.
#Establish critical control point monitoring requirements
#:Monitoring activities are necessary to ensure that the process is under control at each critical control point. In the United States, the [[FSIS]] requires that each monitoring procedure and its frequency be listed in the HACCP plan.
#Establish corrective actions
#:These are actions to be taken when monitoring indicates a deviation from an established critical limit. The final rule requires a plant's HACCP plan to identify the corrective actions to be taken if a critical limit is not met. Corrective actions are intended to ensure that no product is injurious to health or otherwise adulterated as a result if the deviation enters commerce.
#Establish procedures for ensuring the HACCP system is working as intended
#:Validation ensures that the plants do what they were designed to do; that is, they are successful in ensuring the production of a safe product. Plants will be required to validate their own HACCP plans. FSIS will not approve HACCP plans in advance, but will review them for conformance with the final rule.
#:[[Verification and validation|Verification]] ensures the HACCP plan is adequate, that is, working as intended. Verification procedures may include such activities as review of HACCP plans, CCP records, critical limits and microbial sampling and analysis. FSIS is requiring that the HACCP plan include verification tasks to be performed by plant personnel. Verification tasks would also be performed by FSIS inspectors. Both FSIS and industry will undertake microbial testing as one of several verification activities.
#:Verification also includes 'validation' – the process of finding evidence for the accuracy of the HACCP system (e.g. scientific evidence for critical limitations).
#Establish record keeping procedures
#:The HACCP regulation requires that all plants maintain certain documents, including its hazard analysis and written HACCP plan, and records documenting the monitoring of critical control points, critical limits, verification activities, and the handling of processing deviations. Implementation involves monitoring, verifying, and validating of the daily work that is compliant with regulatory requirements in all stages all the time. The differences among those three types of work are given by Saskatchewan Agriculture and Food.

==Standards==
The seven HACCP principles are included in the international standard ISO 22000 FSMS 2011. This standard is a complete food safety and quality&lt;ref name="ISO 22000 FSMS 2005"&gt;ISO 22000 FSMS 2005&lt;/ref&gt; management system incorporating the elements of prerequisite programmes(GMP &amp; SSOP),&lt;ref name="ISO 22000 FSMS 2005"/&gt; HACCP and the quality management system, which together form an organization's Total Quality Management system.

Other standards, such as Safe Quality Food Institute's SQF Code, also relies upon the HACCP methodology as the basis for developing and maintaining food safety (level 2) and food quality (level 3) plans and programs in concert with the fundamental prerequisites of [[good manufacturing practice]]s.&lt;ref name="SQF Code 7.2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sqfi.com/wp-content/uploads/SQF-Code_Ed-7.2-July.pdf|title=SQF Code, Ed. 7.2|publisher=SQF Institute|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water quality management==
The use of HACCP for water quality management was first proposed nearly 20 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A.H. |last=Havelaar |title=Application of HACCP to drinking water supply |date=3 November 1994 |journal=Food Control |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=145–152 |doi=10.1016/0956-7135(94)90074-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, a number of water quality initiatives applied HACCP principles and steps to the control of infectious disease from water, and provided the basis for the Water Safety Plan (WSP) approach in the third edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/GDWQ2004web.pdf |title=Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality |year=2004 |publisher=World Health Organization (WHO)}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been described as "a way of adapting the HACCP approach to drinking water systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first1=Lars |last1=Rosén |first2=Per |last2=Hokstad |first3=Andreas |last3=Lindhe |first4=Snorre |last4=Sklet |first5=Jon |last5=Røstum |title=Generic Framework and Methods for Integrated Risk Management in Water Safety Plans |publisher=Techneau |date=June 2007 |url=http://www.techneau.org/fileadmin/files/Publications/Publications/Deliverables/D4.1.3.summary.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water quality management programme guidelines===
Programme Modernization: According to Ongley, 1998, a series of steps could be taken to execute a more useful transition – from technical programmmes to policy to management decisions. Various aspects of the modernization process have been discussed by Ongley in ESCAP (1997):&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.fao.org/agl/aglw/docs/wr21.pdf Water Quality Management], Retrieved 27 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
*Policy reform – A consultative process must define all the policy tenets and should review the execution of the said policy tenets.
*Legal reform – Legal reform with respect to water quality management is one of the most crucial elements. This could be addressed by the creation of national data standards as well as the creation of a national process to analyze and review collected data. 
*Institutional reform – This is a complex issue and has got no simple answers. Still, there are some key principles that can be helpful for institutional reform in the light of water quality management. One of them is water quality monitoring as a service function. Apart from that, both technical efficiency and capacity issues emerge as major factors in a reformed water quality programmes. 
*Technical reform – This is one area that garners the most attention as well as investment. However, such a kind of reform most targets facility modernization, including other co-factors like data programmes/networks, technical innovation, data management/data products and remediation.

==HACCP for building water systems==
Hazards associated with water systems in buildings include physical, chemical and microbial hazards. In 2013, NSF International, a public health and safety NGO, established education, training and certification programs in HACCP for building water systems. The programs, developed with the guidance of subject matter experts Aaron Rosenblatt and William McCoy center on the use of HACCP principles adapted to the specific requirements of domestic (hot and cold) and utility (HVAC, etc.) water systems in buildings, to prevent plumbing-associated hazards from harming people. Hazards addressed include scalding, lead, and disinfection byproducts as well as a range of clinically important pathogens, such as ''[[Legionella]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', [[nontuberculous mycobacteria]] (NTM), ''[[Acinetobacter]]'', ''[[Elizabethkingia]]'', and ''[[Naegleria]]''. Early adopters of HACCP for building water systems include leading healthcare institutions, notably [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, MN]].

==ISO 22000==
[[ISO 22000]] is a standard designed to help augment HACCP on issues related to food safety. Although several companies, especially big ones, have either implemented or are on the point of implementing ISO 22000, there are many others which are hesitant to do so. The main reason behind that is the lack of information and the fear that the new standard is too demanding in terms of bureaucratic work.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, {{cite web |title=A Comparative Presentation of Implementation of ISO 22000 Versus HACCP and FMEA in a Small Size Greek Factory Producing Smoked Trout: A Case Study |url=http://pdfserve.informaworld.com/343669_758064766_905130187.pdf}} Volume 49, 2009, pages 176–201&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Kendall was born in [[Boston]] to Evelyn Way and [[Henry P. Kendall]], an industrialist. Kendall grew up in [[Sharon, Massachusetts]] and attended [[Deerfield Academy]].&lt;ref name="MIT-obit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1999/kendall.html |title=MIT Nobelist Henry Kendall dies at 72 while scuba diving in Florida lake |author=Sales, Robert J |date=1999-02-16 |publisher=MIT News Office |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled in the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy|U. S. Merchant Marine Academy]] in 1945, and served on a troop transport on the North Atlantic in the winter of 1945 - 1946.

In 1946, he enrolled at [[Amherst College]] where he majored in mathematics, graduating in 1950. While at Amherst, he operated a [[Underwater diving|diving]] and [[marine salvage]] company during two summers.  He co-authored two books, one on shallow water diving and the other on [[underwater photography]].

He did graduate research at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], involving an experimental study of [[positronium]], and he obtained his PhD in 1955.  He then spent the next two years as a postdoctoral fellow at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].  He then spent five years in [[Robert Hofstadter]]'s research group at [[Stanford University]] in the late 50's and early 60's, where he worked with [[Jerome Isaac Friedman|Jerome Friedman]] and [[Richard E. Taylor|Richard Taylor]], studying the structure of [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, using the university's 300 feet long [[Linear particle accelerator|linear electron accelerator]].  He developed a close working relationship with [[Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky]] at Stanford.

He then returned to the [[MIT Physics Department]], where he remained for the rest of his life.

In the late 60's and early '70s, Kendall worked in collaboration with researchers at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]] (SLAC) including Friedman and Taylor. These experiments involved scattering high-energy beams of [[electron]]s from [[proton]]s and [[deuteron]]s and heavier [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. At lower energies, it had already been found that the electrons would only be scattered through low angles, consistent with the idea that the [[nucleon]]s had no internal structure.  However, the SLAC-MIT experiments showed that higher energy electrons could be scattered through much higher angles, with the loss of some energy.  These deep inelastic scattering results provided the first experimental evidence that the protons and neutrons were made up of point-like particles, later identified to be the [[Up quark|up]] and [[Down quark|down]] [[quark]]s that had previously been proposed on theoretical grounds.&lt;ref name=LATimes1990&gt;{{cite news |author1=Dye, Lee |author2=Maugh II, Thomas H |date=1990-10-18 |title=Four U.S.-Based Scientists Share Nobel Prizes |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-18/news/mn-3365_1_nobel-prize |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments also provided the first evidence for the existence of [[gluon]]s.

Kendall was not only a very accomplished physicist, but also a very skilled mountaineer and photographer. He did extensive rock climbing in [[Yosemite Valley]], followed by expeditions to the [[Andes]], [[Himalaya]] and [[Antarctica]], photographing his experiences with large format cameras. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter K|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterK.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 7, 2012, the [[American Alpine Club]] inducted Kendall into its Hall of Mountaineering Excellence at an award ceremony in [[Golden, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''Heslington Brain''' is a 2,600-year-old [[human brain]] found inside a skull buried in a pit in [[Heslington]], [[Yorkshire]], in [[England]], in 2008. It is the oldest preserved brain ever found in [[Eurasia]], and is believed to be the best-preserved ancient brain in the world.&lt;ref name="Medical Daily" /&gt; The skull was discovered during an archaeological dig commissioned by the [[University of York]] on the site of its new campus on the outskirts of the city of [[York]]. The area was found to have been the site of well-developed permanent habitation between 2,000–3,000 years before the present day. 

A number of possibly ritualistic objects were found to have been deposited in several pits, including the skull, which had belonged to a man probably in his 30s. He had been hanged before being decapitated with a knife and his skull appears to have been buried immediately. The rest of the body was missing. Although it is not known why he was killed, it is possible that it may have been a human sacrifice or ritual murder.

The brain was found while the skull was being cleaned. It had survived despite the rest of the tissue on the skull having disappeared long ago. After being extracted at [[York Hospital]], the brain was subjected to a range of medical and forensic examinations which found that it was remarkably intact, though it had shrunk to only about 20% of its original size. It showed few signs of decay, though most of its original material had been replaced by an as yet unidentified organic compound, due to chemical changes during burial. 

According to the archaeologists and scientists who have examined it, the brain has a "resilient, tofu-like texture". It is not clear why the Heslington brain survived, although the presence of a wet, anoxic environment underground seems to have been an essential factor, and research is still ongoing to shed light on how the local soil conditions may have contributed to its preservation.

==Discovery==

The site where the brain was discovered is about {{convert|3|km|mi}} south-east of York city centre on the eastern edge of Heslington village. It is situated partly on the ridge of an ancient glacial [[moraine]] and partly in the basin of the [[Vale of York]].&lt;ref name="YAT report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkarchaeology.co.uk/about/yat-2008-web.pdf |title=37th Annual Report 2008–2009 |publisher=York Archaeological Trust |year=2009 |accessdate=21 August 2012 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the construction of the [[University of York#Heslington East campus|Heslington East campus]] of the University of York in 2009, the site was used as agricultural land.&lt;ref name="JAS" /&gt;

Survey and excavation work, commissioned by the university, was carried out on the site from 2003. It culminated in a full-scale excavation carried out in 2007–08 by [[York Archaeological Trust]] in an area of just over {{convert|8|ha|acre}}.&lt;ref name="YAT report" /&gt; The archaeologists found that the landscape had been inhabited and farmed for thousands of years. The remains of prehistoric fields, buildings and trackways were discovered, dating from the [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]] through to the middle of the [[Iron Age Britain|Iron Age]],&lt;ref name="JAS"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jas.2011.02.030| title = Exceptional preservation of a prehistoric human brain from Heslington, Yorkshire, UK | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 38 | year = 2011 | last1 = o’Connor | first1 = S. | last2 = Ali | first2 = E. | last3 = Al-Sabah | first3 = S. | last4 = Anwar | first4 = D. | last5 = Bergström | first5 = E. | last6 = Brown | first6 = K.

During the Iron Age, the area appears to have been the site of a permanent settlement. The excavators found a number of circular features, which they interpreted as the remains of [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]].&lt;ref name="LiveScience" /&gt; The inhabitants seem to have relocated during the Roman period to a site further up the ridge, leaving the area of the Iron Age settlement to revert to fields.&lt;ref name="YAT report" /&gt;

Around a dozen pits were found on the site and possibly ritualistic objects were found in a number of them. Some pits had been pierced with a single stake, while a number of pits included "burned" cobbles of a local type of stone. The headless body of a [[red deer]] had been deposited in a drainage channel and a red deer antler was found in an Iron Age ditch.&lt;ref name="JAS" /&gt; In one waterlogged pit, a human skull – with the jawbone and the first two vertebrae still attached – was discovered in August 2008, lying face-down at the bottom of the pit. The find was seen as unusual but its true importance was not discovered until after it had been transported, within a block of soil, to the Finds Laboratory of the York Archaeological Trust. As Finds officer Rachel Cubitt was cleaning it, she noticed that something was loose inside the skull.&lt;ref name="YAT report" /&gt; She peered through its base and saw that it contained a "yellow substance". She said later that it "jogged my memory of a university lecture on the rare survival of ancient brain tissue&amp;nbsp;... we gave the skull special conservation treatment as a result and sought expert medical opinion."&lt;ref name="Nouse" /&gt; The skull and its contents were put into cold storage and were examined using a variety of medical and autopsy techniques.&lt;ref name="JAS" /&gt;

==Analysis==
[[File:Archaeology at Heslington East.jpg|right|280px|thumb|The excavation at Heslington East, May 2008.]]
The skull was found to be that of a man aged between 26–45 years old at the time of death, likely in his mid-30s. Radiocarbon dating found that the man had died some time between the 7th century BCE and 5th century BCE (673–482 BCE). He belonged to the [[mtDNA haplogroup|Mitochondrial DNA haplogroup]] [[haplogroup J (mtDNA)|J1d]], which had not previously been seen in Britain, in either living or dead individuals. J1d has been identified previously in only a few people from [[Tuscany]] and the [[Middle East]]; it may have been more widely present in Britain in the past, and lost through [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref name="JAS" /&gt;

He had died from traumatic [[spondylolisthesis]] – a complete fracture of his spine that is usually associated with death by [[hanging]]. Shortly after death his head and upper vertebrae had been severed from his body, almost surgically, using a thin-bladed knife. Although there is evidence from other sites of "[[Human trophy collecting|trophy head]]s" in Iron Age societies, it appears that the head was immediately deposited in the pit and buried in fine-grained wet sediment.&lt;ref name="JAS" /&gt; The reason for the killing is unclear. The archaeological context suggests that the man may have been killed for a ritual or [[human sacrifice|sacrificial]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/features/features/8487242.Was_death_of_Iron_Age_man_a_ritual_killing_/|title=Was death of Iron Age man at Heslington East a ritual killing?|last=Lewis|first=Simon|work=The Press|location=York|date=1 November 2010|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[X-ray computed tomography|CT scanning]] was carried out at [[York Hospital]], where the skull was opened and the contents were removed and forensically examined. The interior of the skull was found to contain several large fragments of brain mixed with sediment. The brain had shrunk to about 20% of its original size, but many anatomical features were still readily identifiable. It was remarkably well-preserved and had few signs of decay other than the presence of a few bacterial spores.&lt;ref name="JAS" /&gt; One of the fragments clearly showed the neural folds of a cerebral lobe.&lt;ref name="YAT report" /&gt;

Discovery of such a well-preserved brain is all the more remarkable, considering the fragility of all human brains following death. Even when placed in a chilled environment in a mortuary, brains quickly dissolve into liquid.&lt;ref name="Medical Daily"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/news/20120817/11577/brain-archeology-well-preserved-heslington-england.htm |title=2,600-Year-Old Brain Found in England, in Remarkably Fresh Condition |last=Brice |first=Makini |work=Medical Daily |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=20 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820030038/http://www.medicaldaily.com/news/20120817/11577/brain-archeology-well-preserved-heslington-england.htm |archivedate=20 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high fat content of the brain means that it is usually the first major organ to deteriorate.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/13410-prehistoric-brain-skull-preservation-decapitated-iron-age.html|title=2,500-Year-Old Preserved Human Brain Discovered|last=Parry|first=Wynne|publisher=LiveScience|date=25 March 2011|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brains of the crew of the [[American Civil War]] submarine ''[[HL Hunley (submarine)|H.&amp;nbsp;L. Hunley]]'' were recovered along with their skeletonised bodies in 2000, and brains were found in the wreck of the English warship ''[[Mary Rose]]'', but archaeologists found that they "liquefied within a matter of minutes" unless preserved immediately in [[formalin]]. Brains found in terrestrial environments have tended to be better preserved, as the surviving material tends to have a higher proportion of hydrophobic (water-repellent) matter than in a fresh brain. There appear to be a number of routes by which brains have been preserved, though a common factor appears to be the existence of a wet, anoxic environment.&lt;ref name="JAS" /&gt; The presence of such an environment is thought to have been responsible for a similar but less complete preservation of brain matter discovered in the 1990s during the construction of a new magistrates' court in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].&lt;ref name="YAT report" /&gt;

The preservation of the brain has been attributed to several factors. First, the waterlogged, [[wiktionary:anoxic|anoxic]] soil in which the head was buried, even though only the brain, and not the rest of the tissue, survived burial. Only scanty traces of other tissue remain on the rest of the skull. Second, the brain had undergone unusual chemical changes as a result of being severed and the conditions under which it was buried. In contrast to other brains found, no [[adipocere]] – a fatty compound formed through the process of decay – was detected in the Heslington brain, probably because the head was severed from the body before the brain had started to decay. There had also been a major decrease in the amount of [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s and their replacement by fatty acids and other substances produced as degradation products. Much of the original substance of the brain has been replaced by a high molecular weight, long-chain, hydrocarbon material that is as yet unidentified. According to the archaeologists who have examined it, the brain is "odourless", with a "smooth surface" and a "resilient, [[tofu]]-like texture."&lt;ref name="JAS" /&gt; 

Thirdly, the human body tends to decay from the inside out, consumed by a post-mortem swarm of bacteria from the gut which spread around the body via blood from the [[alimentary tract]]. In this particular case, the head was severed from the alimentary tract and drained of blood, so the intestinal bacteria did not have an opportunity to contaminate it. The precise mechanism by which the Heslington brain was preserved is unclear, however; in a bid to shed light on this question, researchers buried a number of pigs' heads in and around the campus to see what happened to them{{update-inline|date=November 2018}}.&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/04/110406-oldest-brain-britain-archaeology-science-world/|title=Ancient "Pickled" Brain Mystery Explained?|publisher=National Geographic News|last=Owen|first=James|date=6 April 2011|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2690">'''Interventionism''', when discussing the practice of [[medicine]], is generally a derogatory term used by critics of a [[medical model]] in which patients are viewed as passive recipients receiving external treatments provided by the physician that have the effect of prolonging life, or at least of providing a subjective sense of doing everything possible.

Interventionism is commonly encouraged by [[terminally ill]] patients and their family members when they are emotionally unprepared to acknowledge that the patient is going to die.&lt;ref name=Gawande&gt;{{vcite journal
| url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/02/100802fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all
| title = Letting Go: What should medicine do when it can’t save your life? 
| author = Gawande, Atul
| journal = The New Yorker
| date = 2 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most healthcare providers are uncomfortable telling people that further cure-oriented or life-extending treatment is [[futile medical care]], and patients and families are frequently angry with the provider or feel rejected by the provider when they are given accurate, but negative, information about the patient's prospects.&lt;ref name=Gawande /&gt;  In nearly all cases, "something" can be done for the patient, and families often reward and encourage a provider who proposes a string of useless and often directly harmful treatments; as a result, it is easier for providers to substitute worthless and expensive activity than to honestly admit that nothing will extend the patient's life.&lt;ref name=Gawande /&gt;

Interventionism is related to [[optimism bias]].  This is the belief that the patient will beat the odds, no matter how unlikely this might be.  Optimism bias encourages patients to undertake treatments that have only tiny chances of success, in the erroneous and irrational belief that they will be part of the tiny minority that is successful, rather than part of the vast majority who are not.

With terminally ill patients, the attitude of interventionism prevents providers and patients from taking full advantage of [[palliative care]] options.  The primary focus for palliative care is improving the patient's immediate, daily life through better management of medications, practical assistance, planning for possible complications, and other services.&lt;ref name=Gawande /&gt;  Patients who use palliative care services usually live longer, have fewer disruptive medical crises, incur fewer medical expenses, and have significantly higher quality of life.

'''Latifî''' (1491&amp;ndash;1582), or '''Kastamonulu Latifî Çelebi''', was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] poet and bibliographer. Born in [[Kastamonu]], in northern [[Anatolia]], he became famous for his ''[[tezkire]]'' ''Tezkiretü'ş-Şuara'' (Memoirs of the Poets), the second Ottoman collection of bibliographical data on poets and poetry in overall.

Latifî was born Abdüllatif Hatibzâde&lt;ref name="Turkan"&gt;[http://www.kastamonur.com/test/kastamonulu-bir-tezkireci-ve-divan-airi-latifi-mehmet-tuerkan/ Mehmet Turkan, KASTAMONU’LU BİR TEZKİRECİ VE DİVAN ŞAİRİ (in Turkish)]&lt;/ref&gt; into a notable family in Kastamonu and was educated there. He worked as accountant and [[katib]] (secretary) in various [[vakif]]s (pious foundation), including [[Belgrade]], [[Constantinople]], [[Rhodes]], and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Somel1"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UU8iCY0OZmcC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=Sehi+Bey&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAmoVChMImO73mZjQyAIVCmk-Ch1ZFQ8X#v=onepage&amp;q=Sehi%20Bey&amp;f=false|title=The A to Z of the Ottoman Empire| pages=161-162|author=Selcuk Aksin Somel|location=London|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2010|isbn=9780810875791}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;His major work was ''Tezkiretü'ş-Şuara'' (Memoirs of the Poets), which was the second ''tezkire'' in chronological order after that of [[Sehi Bey]]. It is also the one with most extent copies, 91 in total.&lt;ref name="Elger-Kose"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xMDvp2ypVcC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=tezkire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwA2oVChMI-MvgrqzIyAIViBs-Ch15Rg9Z#v=onepage&amp;q=tezkire&amp;f=false|author=Ralf Elger, Yavuz Köse|page=17| title=Many ways of speaking about the self : Middle Eastern ego-documents in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish (14th-20th century)|publisher=Harrassowitz| location=Wiesbaden |year=2010|isbn=9783447062503 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''tezkire'' was organized in three sections with an introduction.&lt;ref name="Turkan"/&gt; It narrated the life and work of around 300 poets of the period from the reign of [[Murad II]] (reigned between 1421-1451) until 1543, &lt;ref name="Somel1"/&gt; and was finished and presented it to Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in 1546.&lt;ref name="Emiralioglu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibb"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MSxkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Sehi+Bey&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBWoVChMImO73mZjQyAIVCmk-Ch1ZFQ8X#v=onepage&amp;q=Sehi%20Bey&amp;f=false| title=A History of Ottoman Poetry|author=Elias John Wilkinson Gibb|volume=3|page=7|oclc=2110073| editor=Edward Browne|location=London| year=1904| publisher=Luzac &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan was so pleased that he appointed Latifi as secretary at the "[[Abu Ayyub al-Ansari|Ayyub al-Ansari]]" complex endowment. According to [[Aşık Çelebi]]'s work ''Senses of Poets'' (Meşairü'ş-Şuara), the poet wrote it mostly during the era of Suleiman, but presented it to [[Murad III]] in 1574 after making minor changes to the introduction.&lt;ref name="Emiralioglu"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ot2HQMwah_gC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=latifi+%C3%87elebi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBWoVChMIosaAwv_ZyAIVxFs-Ch0zswey#v=onepage&amp;q=latifi%20%C3%87elebi&amp;f=false|pages=77,79|author=Pinar Emiralioglu| title=Geographical Knowledge and Imperial Culture in the Early Modern Ottoman Empire|publisher=Ashgate|year=2004|series= 	Transculturalisms, 1400-1700|isbn=9781472415332 |oclc=853113732}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Another important work of him was ''Evsaf-ı İstanbul'' (Qualities of Istanbul) written in 1525. It gives a historical overview on the city of Istanbul, intertwined with geographical data, and information on the city's neighborhoods, architecture, and social life.&lt;ref name="Somel1"/&gt; 

Latifi spent the last years of his life in Istanbul.&lt;ref name="Turkan"/&gt; He died by drowning when the ship he was traveling to [[Yemen]] sank in the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name="Somel1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="138245">A large number of former [[American football]] ([[NFL]]) players have been diagnosed with or have had [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]], or CTE. A definitive diagnosis so far can be made only [[post-mortem]]. However, an increasing number of former players are reporting symptoms of CTE.

==Former players with CTE confirmed post-mortem ==
A definitive test currently can be made only by examining the brain tissue of a deceased victim.

As the families of many deceased players wish to keep their medical information private, the following list is incomplete. A brain injury study conducted at the [[Boston University School of Medicine]] showed that 33 of 34 players tested post-mortem showed clear signs of CTE,&lt;ref name="34players"/&gt; and additional players have so far been confirmed with CTE separately. A new list released in November 2016 mentions CTE in 90 of 94 brains of former and deceased NFL players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://www.bu.edu/cte/our-research/case-studies/ |title=Case Studies |work=Boston University CTE Center |accessdate=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, a new study showed that 110 of 111 brains examined showed signs of CTE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/25/health/cte-nfl-players-brains-study/index.html|title=CTE found in 99% of studied brains from deceased NFL players|last=CNN|first=Daniella Emanuel|website=CNN|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deceased players suspected of having had CTE==
Included in the list are players diagnosed with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) who were never tested ''post-mortem'' for CTE but whose history appears consistent with CTE. A typical diagnosis of ALS has primarily been based on the symptoms and signs the physician observes in the patient and a series of tests to rule out other diseases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ana.410180302 | volume=18 | issue=3 | title=Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Part 1. Clinical features, pathology, and ethical issues in management | year=1985 | journal=Annals of Neurology | pages=271–280 | author=Tandan Rup}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore, prior to the discovery of CTE as a phenomenon in ex-American football players, many CTE cases were diagnosed as ALS.  The testing of CTE in deceased ex-NFL players began only after the disease                                       was first diagnosed, in 2002, in the brain tissue of [[Mike Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/news/health/late-steeler-great-websters-case-launched-the-cte-brain-debate-687509/ Late Steelers great Webster's case launched the CTE brain debate] ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' 2013-05-14&lt;/ref&gt; After then, testing became common practice only gradually.

Some on this list may have had dementia not related to ALS or CTE.

==Living former players diagnosed with CTE or ALS or reporting symptoms consistent with CTE or ALS==
These players have publicly acknowledged either having been diagnosed with likely CTE or having experienced symptoms, such as dementia or unusual memory loss, consistent with CTE. In some cases, the player has received a diagnosis of ALS but symptoms are consistent with CTE. There are at least two dozen former players who were diagnosed as part of a UCLA study but have not come forward publicly.&lt;ref name=34players /&gt; There are also around 4,500 former players who joined a class action suit against the [[NFL]] alleging that it had covered up a growing body of medical evidence about the preponderance of head-trauma related CTE in ex-NFL players.&lt;ref name=CTEConcussSuit&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/22/us/sport-nfl-concussion-lawsuits/ |title=Former NFL players sue league over head trauma |date=December 22, 2011| accessdate=November 21, 2013 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these ex-players may have medical conditions other than CTE or ALS. For example, ex-players that have presented with symptoms late in life may have other forms of age-related dementia. Some of the former players on this list are came forward only in the context of the class action lawsuit versus the NFL. At present, there is no definitive CTE test available for living persons. Their average age is 51.

| One of Britain's worst ever hailstorms, possibly a [[supercell]], caused massive destruction as hailstones reached up to {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep in places. The storm is also believed to have spawned several [[tornado]]es, and the exact size of the hail that fell within it is unknown. The overall damage was so great that an entire new insurance company, The General Hail Insurance Company, was formed to help cope with future hailstorms. This company would later be known as the [[Norwich Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geologywales.co.uk/storms/1843.htm |title=THE GREAT HAILSTORM OF AUGUST 9, 1843 |publisher=Geologywales.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of name==
The first MADS-box gene to be identified was ''ARG80'' from budding yeast, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'',&lt;ref name="debjdfmf"&gt;Dubois E, Bercy J, Descamps F, Messenguy F: Characterization of two new genes essential for vegetative growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: nucleotide sequence determination and chromosome mapping. Gene 1987, 55:265-275.&lt;/ref&gt; but was at that time not recognized as a member of a large gene family. The MADS-box gene family got its name later as an acronym referring to the four founding members,&lt;ref name="gcof" /&gt; ignoring ''ARG80'':
* '''M'''CM1 from the budding yeast, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'',
* [[agamous|'''A'''GAMOUS]] from the thale cress ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'',
* '''D'''EFICIENS from the snapdragon ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'',&lt;ref name="pmid1968830"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sommer H, Beltrán JP, Huijser P, Pape H, Lönnig WE, Saedler H, Schwarz-Sommer Z | title = Deficiens, a homeotic gene involved in the control of flower morphogenesis in Antirrhinum majus: the protein shows homology to transcription factors | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 605–13 | date = March 1990 | pmid = 1968830 | pmc = 551713 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diversity==
MADS-box genes were detected in nearly all eukaryotes studied.&lt;ref name="glrmstg" /&gt; While the genomes of animals and fungi generally possess only around one to five MADS-box genes, genomes of [[flowering plants]] have around 100 MADS-box genes.&lt;ref name="batg"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Becker A, Theissen G | title = The major clades of MADS-box genes and their role in the development and evolution of flowering plants | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 464–89 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14615187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gltghitchhicker"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gramzow L, Theissen G | title = A hitchhiker's guide to the MADS world of plants | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 214 | pmid = 20587009 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2010-11-6-214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two types of MADS-domain proteins are distinguished; the SRF-like or Type I MADS-domain proteins and the MEF2-like (after [[Mef2|MYOCYTE-ENHANCER-FACTOR2]]) or Type II MADS-domain proteins.&lt;ref name="glrmstg" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gramzow L, Theissen G | title = A hitchhiker's guide to the MADS world of plants | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 214 | pmid = 20587009 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2010-11-6-214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SRF-like MADS-domain proteins in animals and fungi have a second conserved domain, the SAM (SRF, ARG80, MCM1) domain.&lt;ref name="spsad"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shore P, Sharrocks AD | title = The MADS-box family of transcription factors | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 229 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–13 | date = April 1995 | pmid = 7744019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MEF2-like MADS-domain proteins in animals and fungi have the [[MEF2]] domain as a second conserved domain.&lt;ref name="spsad" /&gt; In plants, the MEF2-like MADS-domain proteins are also termed MIKC-type proteins referring to their conserved domain structure, where the MADS (M) domain is followed by an Intervening (I), a Keratin-like (K) and a [[C-terminal domain]].&lt;ref name="batg" /&gt; In plants, MADS-domain protein form tetramers and this is thought to be central for their function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Theissen G, Saedler H | title = Plant biology.

A [[genetics|geneticist]] intensely investigating MADS-box genes is [[Günter Theißen]] at the [[University of Jena]]. For example, he and his coworkers could show by these genes that the [[order (biology)|order]] of [[Gnetum|Gnetales]] is related more closely to the [[Pinophyta|conifers]] than with the [[flowering plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Winter KU, Becker A, Münster T, Kim JT, Saedler H, Theissen G | title = MADS-box genes reveal that gnetophytes are more closely related to conifers than to flowering plants | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 13 | pages = 7342–7 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10377416 | pmc = 22087 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function of MADS-box genes==
MADS-box genes have a variety of functions. In animals, MADS-box genes are involved in muscle development and [[cell proliferation]] and differentiation.&lt;ref name="spsad" /&gt; Functions in fungi range from pheromone response to [[arginine]] metabolism.&lt;ref name="spsad"/&gt;

In plants, MADS-box genes are involved in controlling all major aspects of development, including male and female [[gametophyte]] development, embryo and seed development, as well as root, flower and fruit development.&lt;ref name="batg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gltghitchhicker" /&gt;

Some MADS-box genes of flowering plants have homeotic functions like the [[HOX genes]] of animals.&lt;ref name="gcof" /&gt; The floral homeotic MADS-box genes (such as ''AGAMOUS'' and ''DEFICIENS'') participate in the determination of floral organ identity according to the [[ABC model of flower development]].&lt;ref name="cesmem"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coen ES, Meyerowitz EM | title = The war of the whorls: genetic interactions controlling flower development | journal = Nature | volume = 353 | issue = 6339 | pages = 31–7 | date = September 1991 | pmid = 1715520 | doi = 10.1038/353031a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another function of MADS-box genes is flowering time determination. In ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' the MADS box genes ''SOC1''&lt;ref name="pmid10852935"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Onouchi H, Igeño MI, Périlleux C, Graves K, Coupland G | title = Mutagenesis of plants overexpressing CONSTANS demonstrates novel interactions among Arabidopsis flowering-time genes | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 885–900 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10852935 | pmc = 149091 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.12.6.885 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Flowering Locus C]]''&lt;ref name="pmid10330478"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michaels SD, Amasino RM | title = FLOWERING LOCUS C encodes a novel MADS domain protein that acts as a repressor of flowering | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 949–56 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10330478 | pmc = 144226 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.11.5.949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''FLC'') have been shown to have an important role in the integration of molecular flowering time pathways. These genes are essential for the correct timing of ''[[flowering]]'', and help to ensure that fertilization occurs at the time of maximal reproductive potential.

'''''The Metabarons''''' or '''''The Saga of The Meta-Barons''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[Comics|comic]] series relating the history of a [[dynasty]] of perfect warriors known as the '''Metabarons'''. ''The Metabarons'' series was written by creator [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] and illustrated by [[Argentina|Argentinian]] artist [[Juan Giménez]]. The series, published by [[Humanoids Publishing|Humanoïdes Associés]], is complete, the last volume having been released at the end of 2003.

The first appearance of a Metabaron (chronologically the last of the Metabarons) was May 1981 in the ''[[The Incal|Incal]]'' comic book series. This was followed by a series of prequels that concerned this character's origin, presented as the narration of the [[android (robot)|android]] [[Tonto (Metabarons)|Tonto]] to the android [[Lothar (Metabarons)|Lothar]], of his masters' achievements.  The series takes place over the course of several generations, and chronicles the life of each of the five Metabarons. The stories depict a [[space opera]] reminiscent of Greek tragedy, and heavily influenced by [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' novels. Jodorowsky had been in the early stages of [[Dune_(film)#Early_attempts|making a Dune film]] in 1973.

==Mythology==

===Rites===
Every Metabaron is mutilated by his father in his youth so that his endurance to pain is tested, and receives a powerful mechanical body part as a replacement for the destroyed limb. In each generation, the son and heir must eventually face his father in a battle to the death. These battles have taken many forms, from hand-to-hand combat to space duels, and the succession is only achieved once the son succeeds in [[Patricide|killing his father.]]

===Bushitaka===
The Bushitaka is the strict [[Honor code|code of honor]] followed by the Metabarons; named after the Japanese [[bushido]]. It demands that the practitioners dedicate themselves to victory in all things at any cost, wherein the only alternative to victory is death, and even forsake their own family members in the pursuit of total victory.

===Metabaronic weaponry===
Each Metabaron draws upon an array of advanced weaponry.  These include cybernetically-implanted lasers, [[nanotech]] [[nuclear warheads]] implanted in the body, swords which can disintegrate in bursts of flame, and advanced spaceships.  Many of the Metabarons also exhibit powerful [[psychic]] abilities.

===Castaka===
On the occasion of his son-in-law Othon's succession to the title of Metabaron (intended to be resolved by mortal combat but forestalled by his use of guile to seal victory), Baron Berard of Castaka tells of his caste's lineage leading up to the present.  On the remote planet Ahour-The-Dwarf, a long-forgotten schism had drawn its inhabitants into an interminable civil war between two castes -- the Amakuras and the Castakas -- who adhere to respective versions of a once-shared warrior code, known by the Amakuras as Bushikara and by the Castakas as Bushitaka. One day, the Castakas' queen Oriela was abducted by the Amakura king Divadal, taunting her king Omezo by publicly raping her and taking her hostage. Omezo, employing guile over the established codes of combat, overwhelmed the Amakuras, but not before Divadal released a bioweapon that rendered every man on the planet sterile.

Oriela, having been shielded from the weapon, gave birth to Divadal's son, Dayal -- the last fertile male on the planet, spared in contravention of the bushitaka due to necessity -- then committed ritual suicide eight days later, leaving him only a bite on his shoulder as a memento. Once of age, Dayal became a breeding-stud to all the Castaka women, but once his offspring came of age themselves, Omezo gave up concealing his disgust at his half-Amakura "stepson" and banished him. His mentor General Pakko matched him with his daughter Antigrea, whom he had conceived just before the assault on the Amakuras, and despite initial antipathy they fell in love. Antigrea bore Dayal twin daughters, Myrtha and Narda, but Dayal's disappointment at lacking a male heir drove him to withdraw to the wilderness, hunting wild game, while Antigrea and Pakko raised the twins in the martial arts.

Some years later, the Technopriests elected to build their new space station in Ahour's system. While they saw the planet as no inherent threat, their concern that an enemy might use it as a bridgehead led them to lobby the ageing Omezo to install planetary defences on-world. When he declined, they infected him with a virus in hopes his heir (Dayal) might be more accommodating. The dying Omezo abhored having Dayal succeed him and ordered the murder of him and his family, but Pakko bought time for them to reunite at Dayal's remote bunker. The Technos, witnessing the failure of their machinations, destroyed the whole planet, leaving the bunker adrift as an asteroid. There, Dayal finally acknowledged his warrior daughters and completed their training.

The family hijacked a Techno convoy and leveraged its booty and their lethal martial skills to claim leadership of the pirate asteroid of Thor-Thougah, from which they wage a bloody and profitable offensive against the Technos. Eventually, the Technos catch the pirates in an ambush and Antigrea is mortally wounded. Seeking a burial site, they land on the planet Marmola, but find its [[marble]] composition impossible to dig. They are ambushed by bandits who seek the planet's hidden treasure, a secret guarded by the giant eagle-like Gangez, and use Antigrea's remains as bait to capture him.  Loosing their bonds they overwhelm the bandits, and pledge themselves to the now-dying Gangez who by eating her has become Antigrea's sepulchre. Gangez leads them to the planet's only fertile valley, where they bury him, and his spirit leads them to the planet's treasure: a subterranean reservoir of [[epiphyte]], a substance that defies gravity. Summoning the Techno robots he cast into space on their first raid, Dayal develops the valley into a city for his caste.

Dayal takes ship back to Thor-Thougah with his daughters, seeking sires for them. En route, it emerges that Narda's brain and Myrtha's ovaries have sustained tumours that will rapidly kill them both. With their consent, Dayal has the robots graft Narda's lower body to Myrtha's upper body. Upon arrival in Thor-Thougah, the resulting being confronts the sole survivor of the Technos' assault on the asteroid. He agrees to impregnate her followed by a fight to the death, but when bested he takes his own life, asking to be remembered by his unborn progeny.

Berard concludes his tale by revealing that he is the child of that union, and he welcomed Othon (a fugitive pirate) seeing in him a trace of his own father. Othon is now ready to receive the mark of the Metabarons (the absorbed spirit of Gangez, worn as a mark on the chest) from his father-in-law.

===Main Series===
The main saga of the Metabarons begins on Marmola, on which Berard's tribe export huge blocks of [[marble]]. The existence of the epiphyte has been kept secret by the Castakas for many generations, until its revelation to save the life of Othon von Salza, the son-in-law of Baron Berard. Soon after the revelation of the epiphyte, the planet's orbit becomes a battlefield, with the treacherous Imperial Black Endoguard as the victors. At the end of the war, Othon and his son Bari are the only survivors of the Castaka tribe. The Imperial couple, rulers of the known galaxy, are astonished by the achievement of Othon and reward him; and Othon shows them where the epiphyte was hidden in exchange for a percentage of the new market for anti-G Technology, a new planet to which their palace would be transferred, and a gift for his son intended to restore the joy lost with his crippled legs. The emperor gives him a [[horse]], an extinct species revived by [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]]; but [[pirates]] steal the [[horse]]. Othon kills them in retaliation, but accidentally kills his son, and is castrated by an attacker. Othon thereafter invests a large part of his fortune in the development of the first 'metabaronic' weapons and begins the tradition of [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] implants; and later becomes a mercenary of extraordinary skill and power. By the destruction of 100,000 pirate vessels, he and his descendants receive the title of Metabaron, and the Imperial couple promise a gift. Later, a woman named Honorata offers that she can bear Othon a child if he places a drop of his blood in her [[uterus]]. With this done, two of Othon's servants try to commit suicide, taking the pregnant Honorata with them; but Othon injects a potion of [[epiphyte]] into Honorata. This deprives his son, Aghnar von Salza, of weight; wherefore Othon lets Honorata train Aghnar by herself. When Aghnar is seven years old, he defeats a machine set against him by his father; whereupon Othon continues his training. Honorata then confesses she was ordered to give birth to a [[hermaphrodite]] instead of a son, by the priestesses of Shabda-Oud. For her disobedience, the Shabda-Oud attempt her destruction. Othon, to assure his son's ability to avenge her, orders Aghnar to fight him to the death, and Aghnar seizes the title of Metabaron for himself.

The sole human in a hostile world, Aghnar befriends a single primatoid, and becomes its tribe's [[messiah]]. He then seizes a Shabda-Oud cetacyborg battleship with which to carry out his vengeance; but is distracted by the Cetacyborg's crew's original objective: to capture Princess Oda, to use her for the sisterhood's breeding experiments. After a telepathic confrontation with the sisterhood, Oda suffers debilitating injuries; whereupon Honorata, kept alive by her own mental powers, transfers her own soul to Oda, who thereafter bears Aghnar a son. Disgusted by his incest, Aghnar attempts to kill his son, whom Oda/Honorata gives a cybernetic head to replace his own, for which he is called Steelhead. Steelhead later kills his parents. At his claim to the title of Metabaron, the Princess Doña Vicenta argues that his offspring must be unworthy of the title. Therefore, Steelhead assumes the disembodied head of Zaran Krleza, the last poet in the galaxy. United in body and head (but somehow maintaining individual personas), Steelhead and Zaran become Melmoth, which declares Doña Vicenta as the object of his affections, and resurrects her father, along with a rare, titanic tree (both destroyed by Steelhead himself). Doña Vicente consents to the match; but the clone of her father attempts to take her by force, whereupon Vicenta gives him her eyes. Mollified, he permits Melmoth and Doña Vicenta to marry; but Melmoth discovers that Tonto, his robotic servant, has replaced her eyes by cybernetic sensors, and shuns her. Eventually, he reverts to the form and character of Steelhead, and takes care of his bride. When unable to preserve both of Vicenta's twin children alive, Steelhead removes the male twin's brain and implant it in the female child, and trains the [[androgynous]] Aghora would be trained as a warrior, who eventually faces his/her father in single combat to become Metabaron. To conceive an heir, he/she extracts the male cells from his/her own brain and implants them in his/her womb, thereby creating a male [[cloning|clone]]: later the Nameless Metabaron who reigns in ''Incal.''

In the last chapter of the saga (''Sans-Nom, le dernier Méta-Baron''), Lothar, the faithful android to whom Tonto is relating the Metabaronic lore in the [[frame narration]], is identified as Steelhead himself, kept alive by his conversion to a robotic existence. Recovering his personality, but not his full memories, after a brief confrontation in which he gives Nameless the iconic scarring in his eyebrow, he allies himself with a vampiric creature to enact his vengeance upon his descendant. Ultimately, he repents; whereupon Nameless has himself [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilized]], and remains in self-pity until the Spirit of the Castaka family, embodied by the mark on his chest, prompts Nameless to become a force for good, protecting life whenever he can. With this new mission, the Metabaron becomes the unstoppable mercenary featured in the [[Incal]].

'''Mr. Freeze''' ('''Victor Fries''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Batman]]. Created by writer Dave Wood and artist [[Sheldon Moldoff]], the character first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #121 (February 1959),&lt;ref name="UGO - Freeze"/&gt; where he was known as '''Mr. Zero'''. Mr. Freeze is one of Batman's most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up Batman's [[List of Batman Family adversaries#Classic Rogues Gallery|rogues gallery]].

In the most common variation of his [[origin story]], he is a former [[cryogenics]] expert in [[Gotham City]] who was involved in a laboratory accident while attempting to cure his [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife [[Nora Fries]]. The disaster lowered his body temperature to the point that he must wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive, and he utilizes a "freeze gun" that freezes its targets solid.

Mr. Freeze was played by [[George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]] and [[Eli Wallach]] in the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in the 1997 film ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'', and by [[Nathan Darrow]] on the television series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]''. He was voiced by [[Michael Ansara]] in the [[DC animated universe]], by [[Clancy Brown]] in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', and by [[Maurice LaMarche]] in the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' video game franchise. [[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time List ranked Mr. Freeze as #67.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/67.html |title=Mr. Freeze is Number 67 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213184608/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/67.html |archivedate=2010-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Originally called Mr. Zero,&lt;ref name="UGO - Freeze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/mrfreeze/ |title=UGO's World pf Batman - Rogues Gallery: Mr. Freeze |accessdate=May 10, 2008 |publisher=[[UGO]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527232551/http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/mrfreeze/ |archivedate=May 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was renamed and popularized by the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' television series]], in which he was played by several actors.&lt;ref name="Freeze 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeze 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeze 3"/&gt;

Nearly 30 years later, a television adaptation of Batman revitalized him once again. ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' retold Mr. Freeze's origin in "[[Heart of Ice (Batman: The Animated Series episode)|Heart of Ice]]", an episode by writer [[Paul Dini]]. The episode introduced his terminally ill, [[cryogenics|cryogenically frozen]] wife [[Nora Fries|Nora]], which explained his obsession with ice and need to build a criminal empire to raise research funds.&lt;ref name="Heart of Ice"/&gt; This more complex, tragic character was enthusiastically accepted by fans, and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media, including the comic book series itself, which previously had the character casually killed off by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Chuck Dixon|Dixon, Chuck]]|penciller=[[Tom Lyle|Lyle, Tom]]|inker=[[Bob Smith (comics)|Smith, Bob]]|colorist=[[Adrienne Roy|Ray, Adrienne]]|letterer=[[Tim Harkins|Harkins, Tim]]|editor=[[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neil, Dennis]]|story=Joker's Wild|title=[[Robin (comic book)|Robin]]|volume=2|issue=1|date=October 1991|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeze was resurrected in the comic after the episode aired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Chuck Dixon|Dixon, Chuck]]|penciller=[[Barry Kitson|Kitson, Barry]]|inker=[[Bob Smith (comics)|Smith, Bob]]|colorist=[[Adrienne Roy|Roy, Adrienne]]|letterer=[[John Costanza|Costanza, John]]|editor=[[Scott Peterson (comics)|Peterson, Scott]]|story=Cold Cases|title=[[Detective Comics]]|volume=1|issue=670|date=January 1994|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was seen as groundbreaking for a Saturday morning cartoon and helped set the tone for the rest of the series. This backstory was also made [[canon (fiction)|canon]] in the comics and has been the character's official origin in almost every incarnation of Batman until September 2011, when [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity.

Elements of this origin story were incorporated into the 1997 film ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1= Steve| last1= Daly| first2= Anne| last2= Thompson|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,291605,00.html|title=A Tights Squeeze|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 8, 1996|accessdate=May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Batman121 mr zero.jpg|upright|thumb|The character's first appearance as "Mr. Zero" in ''Batman'' #121 (Feb. 1959). Art by [[Curt Swan]].]]
From the time of his first appearance in 1959 onwards, Mr. Freeze was portrayed as one of many "joke" villains (see also [[Killer Moth]]) cast as stock enemies of Batman.&lt;ref name="UGO - Freeze"/&gt; Originally called Mr. Zero,&lt;ref name="UGO - Freeze"/&gt; the producers of the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series renamed him Mr. Freeze (and portrayed Batman addressing him as "'''Dr. Schivel'''"),&lt;ref name="UGO - Freeze"/&gt; and the name quickly carried over to the comic books. The three actors who portrayed Mr Freeze were [[George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]], and [[Eli Wallach]].

===Silver Age===
In the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-''Crisis'']] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], it is explained that Mr. Freeze is a rogue scientist whose design for an "ice gun" backfires when he inadvertently spills cryogenic chemicals on himself, resulting in him needing [[wiktionary:subzero|subzero]] temperatures to survive.&lt;ref name="UGO - Freeze"/&gt;

===Modern Age===
[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-''Crisis'']], Freeze was revamped using a similar backstory to the one created by Paul Dini for ''Batman: The Animated Series''.&lt;ref name="wf interview page 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/heartofice/interview/02.php |title=''Heart of Ice'' interview "The Role of Mr. Freeze In The Animated Universe" page 2 - Finding a Voice|accessdate=2008-02-08 |publisher= worldsfinestonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Dr. Victor Fries, Ph.D.''' (surname pronounced "freeze") was a brilliant [[cryogenics|cryogenicist]]. As a child, he was fascinated with [[cryonics]], so he began freezing animals. His parents, horrified by his "hobby", sent him to a strict [[boarding school]], where he was miserable and felt detached from humanity. In college, he met a woman named [[Nora Fries|Nora]], whom he fell in love with and ultimately married.&lt;ref name="UGO - Freeze"/&gt;

A year and a half after Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, Nora contracts a fatal illness, so Fries begins developing a freeze ray for [[GothCorp]] in order to preserve her in [[suspended animation|cryo-stasis]] until a cure can be found. Fries' boss [[Ferris Boyle]] decides to tell the mob about the gun, leading Batman to create a team of specialists to help him do his job better. As Fries puts Nora in suspended animation, Boyle  interrupts and tampers with the experiment, resulting in an explosion that kills Nora. Fries survives, but the chemicals in the freeze ray lower his body temperature to the point that he must wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive. He swears revenge on those responsible for the death of his wife (whom he talks to often), and becomes Mr. Freeze, the first supervillain Batman faces in this continuity. Eventually, however, Batman's operatives find Freeze, who shoots one of them with his freeze gun. However, Batman eventually apprehends him.&lt;ref name="UGO - Freeze"/&gt;

Freeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything he encounters&lt;ref name="UGO - Freeze"/&gt; so he never forges alliances with the other criminals in Gotham, preferring to work alone. On rare occasions he has worked with another member of Batman's rogues gallery, usually as an enforcer for Gotham's mob bosses, such as the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] or [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]. In one of his notable team-ups, Freeze constructs a cryogenic machine for [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] so that Hush might take revenge on Batman, Freeze's equipment allowing Hush to preserve [[Catwoman]]'s surgically-removed heart to use as a means of threatening her life.

During his time with the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], he fashions for [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]] a sub-zero machine in exchange for the use of her own [[Lazarus Pit]]. He attempts to restore Nora to life without waiting for the ''adjusting'' needed in the pool chemicals. However, she returns to life as the twisted Lazara, and escapes. She blames her husband for her plight, and she estranges herself from him.

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, during the ''[[Night of the Owls]]'' crossover, the [[Court of Owls]] sends assassins known as Talons to kill 40 of the most important citizens of Gotham, including Mr. Freeze. [[Jason Todd|The Red Hood]], [[Starfire (Teen Titans)|Starfire]] and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]] choose to save him, and subsequently remand him into [[Batgirl]]'s custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer=[[Scott Lobodell|Lobodell, Scott]]|penciller=[[Kenneth Rocafort|Rocafort, Kenneth]]|inker=[[Kenneth Rocafort|Rocafort, Kenneth]]|letterer=[[Dezi Sienty|Sienty, Dezi]]|editor=[[Bobbie Chase|Chase, Bobbie]]|story=Last Regrets - I've Had a Few|title=[[Red Hood and the Outlaws]]| volume=1|issue=8| date=June 2012| publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Batman Annual'' #1 introduces a new origin for Mr. Freeze. Here, Victor Fries' fascination with cryonics began when he was a boy and his mother fell through the ice of a frozen lake. The ice was able to keep her preserved long enough for help to arrive, thus sparking his lifelong obsession with the cold. It is later revealed that the accident left Fries' mother in constant pain, and Fries ended her suffering by pushing her into the same frozen lake. In this new origin, Nora was never Fries' wife. Her name was Nora Fields, a woman born in 1943. When Nora was 23, she was diagnosed with an incurable heart disease, so her family placed her in cryogenic stasis hoping that a cure would be found in the future. Fries, having written his doctoral thesis on Nora, took on a position as a cryogenic researcher and technician at Wayne Enterprises, the facility that housed Nora's body.

Eventually, he fell in love with Nora and became dedicated to finding a reliable method for slowly thawing cryogenic subjects. However, Bruce Wayne ordered the project to be shut down, as he began to feel uncomfortable with Fries' obsession with Nora. Furious, Fries hurled a chair at Wayne, who dodged the attack; the chair smashed into an array of cryonic chemical tanks, the contents of which sprayed onto Fries and transformed him into Mr. Freeze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Scott Snyder|Snyder, Scott]]|penciller=[[Jason Fabok|Fabok, Jason]]|inker=[[Jason Fabok|Fabok, Jason]]|colorist=[[Peter Steigerwald|Steigerwald, Peter]]|letterer=[[Sal Cipriano|Cipriano, Sal]]|editor=[[Mike Marts|Marts, Mike]]|story=Night of the Owls: First Snow|title=[[Batman Annual]]|volume=2|issue=1|date=July 2012|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Owls uses Freeze's cryogenic-thaw formula to revive their Talons, and then they try to kill him. Freeze survives, but is captured by the Red Hood and sent to [[Arkham Asylum]]. He escapes shortly afterward and rearms himself with the Penguin's help. Freeze decides to kill Bruce Wayne and take Nora, whom he believes to be his wife, so that they can leave [[Gotham City]] behind forever. Infiltrating [[Wayne Enterprises]], Freeze has a brief fight with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]], but he subdues them. Then, Freeze goes to the penthouse, where he finds Batman and the frozen Nora. Batman defeats Mr. Freeze by injecting his suit with the thawing formula, which he had intended to use to revive Nora from suspended animation.

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Mr. Freeze appears as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] at the time when the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]] arrived from their world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[David Finch (comics)|Finch, David]]|inker=[[Richard Friend|Friend, Richard]]|colorist=[[Sonia Oback|Oback, Sonia]]|letterer=[[Rob Leigh|Leigh, Rob]]| editor=[[Brian Cunningham|Cunningham, Brian]]|story=Nightfall| title=[[Forever Evil]]|volume=1|issue=1|date=November 2013| publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|The Scarecrow]] later visits Mr. Freeze to let him know of the war going on at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer=[[Peter Tomasi|Tomasi, Peter]]|penciller=[[Szymon Kudranski|Kudranksi, Szymon]]|inker=[[Szymon Kudranski|Kudranksi, Szymon]]|colorist=[[John Kalisz|Kalisz, John]]|letterer=[[Dezi Sienty|Sienty, Dezi]]|editor=[[Mike Marts|Marts, Mike]]|story=City of Fear| title=The Scarecrow|volume=2|issue=23.3|date=November 2013| publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Man-Bat]]s are able to bring the remaining Talons to Mr. Freeze after Man-Bat and Scarecrow steal them from Blackgate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer=[[Peter Tomasi|Tomasi, Peter]]|penciller=[[Scot Eaton|Eaton, Scot]]|inker=[[Jaime Mendoza|Mendoza, Jaime]]|colorist=[[Andrew Delhouse|Delhouse, Andrew]]|letterer=[[Taylor Esposito|Esposito, Taylor]]|editor=[[Rachel Gluckstern|Gluckstern, Rachel]]|story=Batman Death March| title=[[Forever Evil|Forever Evil: Arkham War]]|volume=1|issue=1|date=December 2013| publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer=[[Peter Tomasi|Tomasi, Peter]]|penciller=[[Scot Eaton|Eaton, Scot]]|inker=[[Jaime Mendoza|Mendoza, Jaime]]|colorist=[[Andrew Dalhouse|Dalhouse, Andrew]]|letterer=[[Travis Lanham|Lanham, Travis]]|editor=[[Rachel Gluckstern|Gluckstern, Rachel]]|story=Das Bat!| title=[[Forever Evil|Forever Evil: Arkham War]]|volume=1|issue=3|date=February 2014| publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Freeze and [[Clayface]] later encounter the Rogues when they land in their territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer=[[Brian Buccellato|Buccallato, Brian]]|penciller=[[Scott Hepburn|Hepburn, Scott]]|inker=[[Andre Coehlo|Coehlho, Andre]]|colorist=[[Nick Filardi|Filardi, Nick]]|letterer=[[Dezi Sienty|Sienty, Dezi]]|editor=[[Brian Cunningham|Cunningham, Brian]]|story=Dark Knight| title=[[Forever Evil|Forever Evil: Rogues Rebellion]]|volume=1|issue=3|date=February 2014| publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Freeze tells [[Mirror Master]] II he is not interested in capitalizing on the bounty on their heads, only to use [[Weather Wizard]] to create optimal conditions for him to freeze Gotham.

==Powers and abilities==
Like most Batman villains, Mr. Freeze plans his crimes about a specific [[Motif (visual arts)|theme]]; in his case, ice, snow and cold.&lt;ref name="UGO - Freeze"/&gt; He freezes areas around him using special weapons and equipment, most notably a handheld "freeze-gun". His refrigeration suit grants him superhuman strength and durability, making him a powerful villain in Batman's [[rogues gallery]].&lt;ref name="UGO - Freeze"/&gt;

In the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] grants Mr. Freeze the ability to generate subzero temperatures, no longer needing his freeze-gun or refrigeration suit. However, after his encounter with [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]], [[Donna Troy]], and [[Purgatory (comics)|Purgatory]] in Central Park, he reverted to his original subzero biology. He then gained a new subzero armor and weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = [[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]]|artist = [[Howard Porter (artist)|Porter, Howard]]; [[Phil Jimenez|Jimenez, Phil]] and others| Story = | Title = Underworld Unleashed| Volume = | Issue = 3| Date = November 1995 - January 1996| Publisher = [[DC Comics]]| location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''===
In the crossover comic, Mr. Freeze was mutated into a humanoid mutant [[polar bear]] by [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]].

===Batman: White Knight===
Victor Fries appears in the 2017 series [[Batman: White Knight]]. In this series, Victor Fries has retired from his criminal lifestyle to focus on curing his wife's disease. It is later revealed that, due to his unique, cryogenically-dependent physiology, Fries's aging had been slowed considerably, and that his father was a member of the Nazi SS during the Second World War, but acted as a double agent, allowing America to stay one step ahead of Germany on the Scientific front. As a result of this, a massive freeze cannon was constructed beneath a lighthouse off the coast of [[Gotham City]]. The superweapon is discovered by Neo-Joker (the second [[Harley Quinn]] who felt that by taking pills to retain his sanity, [[Joker (character)|Jack Napier]] was destroying the most beautiful part of himself), and is used to freeze most, if not all, of Gotham. Freeze is able to reverse the effects with the aid of [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]]. It is also revealed that Fries had been contacted by Batman in an attempt to secure the villains aid to save the life of [[Alfred Pennyworth]], but unfortunately their efforts were in vain.

While the George Sanders version wore the classic refrigerated suit, the Otto Preminger and Eli Wallach versions wore a "Freeze Collar" around their neck that went with Mr. Freeze's cooling suit. Before Mr. Freeze was on the series, he was always called Mr. Zero. In this version, he continues to be [[camp (style)|campy]] like the comic books and is given an alias of "Dr. Art Schivel". In his first appearance "Instant Freeze", it is revealed that it was [[Batman]] who spilled the cryogenic chemicals on Schivel during an attempted arrest. Freeze ends up stealing diamonds from the Gotham City Diamond Exchange. When Batman and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] try to stop him, he freezes them with his freeze gun. In the next episode "Rats Like Cheese", Mr. Freeze kidnaps Paul Diamante of the Gotham City Eagles and offers to return his hostage in exchange for Batman. Batman and Robin save Diamante and apprehend Freeze. During this appearance, Mr. Freeze's hideout has "warm lights" so that his henchmen can interact with him. In the episode "Green Ice", Mr. Freeze escapes from prison and captures [[Miss Iceland]] from the finals of the Miss Galaxy Pageant. In the next episode "Deep Freeze", Mr. Freeze has led all of Gotham City to believe that Batman has given in to his bribes. Batman and Robin managed to find Freeze's hideout, rescue Miss Iceland, and defeat Freeze before he can freeze all of Gotham. Batman arranges for Warden Crichton to have a special refrigerated cell made for Mr. Freeze. In the episode "Ice Spy", Mr. Freeze kidnaps Icelandic scientist Professor Isaacson in order to obtain an "Instant Ice" formula. In the episode "The Duo Defy", Mr. Freeze finally obtains the "Instant Ice" formula and ends up building a large freeze ray. He is thwarted by Batman and Robin again. As he is taken away by the police, Freeze tells the police officers not to touch the Freeze Collar's dials.

As in the comics, he is a scientist who researches cryogenic technology to find a cure for his wife Nora's terminal illness. To this end, he freezes Gotham's citizens with a cryogenic gun and uses them as test subjects. Horrified at what Victor has become, Nora indirectly kills herself during one of the experiments (replacing a perfected coolant with a failed, lethal formula). Devastated, Fries attempts suicide by turning the coolants from his gun on himself. He survives, however, and is rendered unable to survive outside of sub-zero temperatures. [[Hugo Strange]] has him declared dead and takes him to [[Arkham Asylum]]'s Indian Hill Laboratory, where he uses him as an "assistant" in experiments with cryogenically frozen bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=A Dead Man Feels No Cold |episodelink= |series=Gotham |serieslink= |credits=Bruno Heller, Megan Mostyn-Brown |network=Fox |station= |airdate=2015-03-07 |season=2|number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strange also dispatches him to kill Karen Jennings, one of his former test subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Pinewood |episodelink= |series=Gotham |serieslink= |credits=Bruno Heller, Megan Mostyn-Brown |network=Fox |station= |airdate=April 18, 2015 |season=2|number=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the season finale, "Wrath of the Villains: Transference", Strange orders Fries to kill [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]], but [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Bridgit Pike]], another of Strange's genetically altered minions, interferes.

They persuade him to help Cobblepot in his revenge on fellow criminal [[Riddler|Edward Nygma]] by returning his special suit to him that they took from [[Wayne Enterprises]] and promising to cure his condition. In the episode "Heroes Rise: Destiny Calling," Fries assists mobster [[Fish Mooney]] with obtaining an antidote to a virus engineered by [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Jervis Tetch]], and fighting [[ninja]] sent by the [[League of Shadows]]. After Mooney's death, Fries, Pike and Strange are arrested by the police, but Cobblepot arranges their release. In the episode "Heroes Rise: Heavydirtysoul", Cobblepot has Fries use his freeze gun on Nygma in order to turn him into a frozen "centerpiece" for the [[Iceberg Lounge]]. In the episode, "A Dark Knight: The Demon's Head," after Nygma is freed from his icy prison, Cobblepot summons Freeze to put him back on ice, but when he realizes that he's no longer the Riddler or Ed Nygma anymore, Cobblepot decides to spare him. In the episode, "A Dark Knight: The Sinking Ship, The Grand Applause," Fries is recruited to join [[Jerome Valeska]]'s "Legion of Horribles," along with Tetch, [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], Pike, Cobblepot, and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. In "A Dark Knight: Mandatory Brunch Meeting," he attends the Legion of Horrible's mandatory brunch meeting, where Jerome assigns him to find a big laboratory. In "A Dark Knight: That's Entertainmen!," Fries and Tetch bring back a hostage for Scarecrow to test his new laughing toxin. In the season finale, "A Dark Knight: No Man's Land," after Jeremiah Valeska blows up all bridges that lead out of the city, Gotham is labeled as a "no man's land," with villains, including Fries, claiming territory across the city.
* Victor Fries was mentioned by [[Icicle (comics)|Dr. Thomas Snow]] as one of his scientist contacts in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode "The Icicle Cometh" of the show's [[The Flash (season 5)|fifth season]].

* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'' episode "The Deep Freeze", voiced by [[Lennie Weinrib]]. Unlike his appearance in the theme song, Mr. Freeze is shown without the helmet that goes with his freeze suit. He and his henchman Professor Frost plot to steal the N-1000 (a superfast submarine) to pull off the "Crime of the Century". When Batman and Robin raid his hideout, Mr. Freeze manages to freeze both of them and takes Robin with him as he escapes. When Freeze and Professor Frost steal the N-1000, they steer it to the [[North Pole]]. When Batman, Robin and [[Bat-Mite]] face Mr. Freeze and Professor Frost at the North Pole, Batman and Robin fire a beam that reverses the polarity of Freeze's freeze gun so that it warms up. They then apprehend Freeze and Professor Frost where they are both placed into prison.

Home Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryogenic scientist Victor Fries was working for Gothcorp and [[embezzlement|embezzled]] funds for an experiment in order to save his [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife [[Nora Fries]] by cryogenically freezing his wife until a cure could be found. However, the company's CEO Ferris Boyle (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]) broke into the lab with guards, demanding an end be put to the experiment. When Fries desperately grabbed a security guard's pistol to aim at Boyle, the corrupt CEO kicked him into a table of chemical beakers filled with cryogenic substance, leaving Victor to die. He survived but was severely [[mutation|mutated]] by the substances. Unable to live outside subzero conditions, he wears a cryogenic suit to survive and also triples his strength. Mister Freeze is introduced in the [[Emmy Award]]-winning episode "[[Heart of Ice (Batman: The Animated Series)|Heart of Ice]]" (for Outstanding Writing in an Animated Program). He steals the parts for a freezing machine he wishes to build and use in his vendetta against Boyle. This leads to Freeze's first confrontation with Batman. When he freezes Boyle up to the waist, Boyles now begging for his life, Freeze confronts Batman, fighting one-on-one until Freeze's transparent head dome is broken when Batman uses [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s thermos of [[chicken soup]], inducing [[thermal shock]] and rendering Freeze unconscious. The Dark Knight then presents evidence of Boyle's crime involving Nora to the press and leaving Boyles in this frozen condition for his horrible act.

After being kidnapped by a giant robot and brought to the off-shore Oceana city, he meets billionaire amusement park designer Grant Walker (voiced by [[Daniel O'Herlihy]]), a man that wants to become immortal like Freeze to create a frozen world for selected residents. Freeze agrees to help when Walker promises to cure Nora. Batman and Robin arrive and try to reason with Freeze that if he were to help Walker, Nora would hate him. Freeze eventually turns on Walker, freezing his benefactor to a wall. Freeze overloads Oceana's power-core which starts the city's destruction as he instructs its inhabitants to evacuate. Freeze stays behind to die with his wife, and he along with Nora and Walker disappear in the explosion. The episode's ending reveals that they all survive, trapped in [[iceberg]]s.&lt;ref name="Deep Freeze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/btas/df.html|title=Deep Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Toon Zone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mister Freeze's next appearance is in the direct-to-animated film ''[[Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]''. After Nora's tank is shattered, Freeze kidnaps [[Barbara Gordon]] to harvest organs to cure Nora. Freeze makes a deal with greedy former colleague Gregory Belson (voiced by [[George Dzundza]]) to help cure his wife in exchange for gold. Batman and Robin thwart this plan and Freeze is then presumed killed in the explosion of his lair on an abandoned oil rig. Wayne Enterprises then finances a surgery that saves Nora's life. Freeze is last seen at the [[North Pole]], crying tears of joy as he learns of Nora's recovery.

When a cured Nora Fries married her own doctor and left Gotham permanently, the [[psychological trauma|trauma]] destroys whatever is left of Fries' humanity. Mister Freeze vows to inflict on others the loss he's suffered in the episode "Cold Comfort" by taking away the things they value most, much to the confusion of [[Tim Drake|Robin]] and Batgirl. When Freeze is confronted at his hideout by Batman and Batgirl, he reveals his true condition to them as well as his goal of destroying [[Gotham City]] &amp;mdash; all the Dark Knight holds dear &amp;mdash; by dropping a 'reverse fusion bomb' that will freeze the city. Freeze boards a helicopter to drop the bomb. However, he is followed by Batman and they engage in a duel in which Batman uses a grappling gun to hook Freeze to the bomb and drop it into the river, where an explosion creates a huge iceberg. Although Freeze is presumed dead, his head is seen to be missing as the episode ends.&lt;ref name="Cold Comfort"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/tnba/cc.html|title=Cold Comfort| accessdate= 2008-05-09| publisher=Toon Zone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Cold Comfort |episodelink= |series=The New Batman Adventures |serieslink= |credits=Hilary J.

** In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', several of Mister Freeze's guns have been procured by the elderly Bruce Wayne and are displayed in the Batcave. The new [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Batman]] (Terry McGinnis) uses one to freeze [[Inque]] in the episode "Black Out", however, Inque destroys this one in the episode "Disappearing Inque". Another one is seen in the Batcave's background during subsequent episodes. The tragic villain personally appears in the episode "Meltdown". His disembodied head is revealed to have [[Immortality|survived for decades]] thanks to cryogenic technology. Wayne-Powers' CEO [[Derek Powers]] and Dr. Stephanie Lake (voiced by [[Linda Hamilton]]) use him as a test subject for a process that could cure Powers's own mutation. Transferring his mind into a [[cloning|clone]] built from his own baseline [[DNA]], Victor Fries sees this as a second chance. Fries initially tries to right some of the wrongs he has committed by creating a charitable organization with all his legitimate earnings from before he was imprisoned, which impresses Terry. However, Victor's new body soon begins to revert to his original body's same subzero [[biology]]. Although Lake and Powers betray him when he returns to Wayne-Powers for help, Fries escapes. After recovering an advanced suit of sub-zero armor that fires ice blasts directly out of gauntlets equipped onto his hands, Mister Freeze seeks revenge by freezing Lake and Powers and attempting to blow up Wayne-Powers' complex to commit suicide. In the middle of his plan, Freeze battles Batman and then fights with Blight. Freeze redeems himself by saving the new Dark Knight from Blight. Batman attempts to rescue Freeze from the collapsing building, however, Freeze refuses help and presumably dies in the explosion.&lt;ref name="Meltdown"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.toonzone.net/anbat/bb/meltdown.html| title= Meltdown| accessdate= 2008-05-09| publisher= Toon Zone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BB - Meltdown"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Meltdown |episodelink= |series=Batman Beyond |serieslink= |credits=Hilary J.

[[Image:Ourgovernor.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Mr. Freeze in the 1997 film ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'']]
* Mr. Freeze appears as the main antagonist in the 1997 film ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'', portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] (who received top billing ahead of George Clooney, who portrayed Batman). In the film, Dr. Victor Fries was in an accident in a cryogenics lab he was using to find a cure for his wife Nora Fries suffering from the (fictional) [[terminal illness]] MacGregor's Syndrome and is now dependent on a [[diamond]]-powered subzero suit to keep cold or he would die. Mister Freeze crashes a charity event held by Wayne Enterprises and steals a diamond from the event. Mister Freeze is captured by Batman and detained at Arkham Asylum, but flees with the help of [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and Bane. Ivy cuts off Nora's [[life support]] and deceives Mister Freeze into thinking that Batman was responsible for the deed as part of a plan to use him to freeze up Gotham City. With the use of a gigantic ray gun stationed in an observatory, he freezes over the entirety of Gotham. In a subsequent fight with Batman, Mr. Freeze destroys the observatory with a set of bombs (planted by Bane) in an unsuccessful attempt to take Batman with him. Batman shows Mr. Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl in which she brags about killing Nora, revealing her real colours to him. Batman tells Mr. Freeze that his wife is not dead; she was restored and moved to Arkham, where he can complete his research. Batman asks him for the cure he created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for [[Alfred Pennyworth]]; Mr. Freeze atones for his past actions by giving Batman the medicine he had developed. Freeze is then detained at Arkham where he exacts his revenge on Ivy for her deception and trechery. The character's penchant for cold and ice-related puns was noted by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Janet |last=Maslin |authorlink=Janet Maslin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/batman-film-review.html |title=Batman and Robin |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=June 20, 1997|accessdate=May 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970620/REVIEWS/706200301 |title=Batman &amp; Robin |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=June 20, 1997|accessdate=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] of [[Reelviews]] commented that "Schwarzenegger, aside from looking like a cross between the [[Michelin Man]] and [[Robocop]], appears totally confused about what he's doing. Sometimes he's in ''[[Terminator (character concept)|Terminator]]'' mode; on other occasions, he's chomping on a cigar like he's back in ''[[Last Action Hero]]''." He also noted that Freeze's backstory and motivation were "too complex for Schwarzenegger to convey effectively or for [[Joel Schumacher|[director Joel] Schumacher]] to care about exploring. As a result, Mr. Freeze ends up being a frustratingly incomplete brute who's out to smother Gotham City under a blanket of ice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Berardinelli|authorlink=James Berardinelli |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/b/batman4.html |title=Batman and Robin |work=[[ReelViews]]|date=June 20, 1997|accessdate=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robin Dougherty of [[Salon (website)|Salon]] lamented that "Schwarzenegger’s exuberance is pinned down.

* Mr. Freeze is also one of the main villains in the PC game ''Toxic Chill''. Mr. Freeze pairs up with the Riddler in an attempt to change the very weather of Gotham. He is eventually betrayed and nearly killed by the Riddler who sets off a volcanic eruption. Both are sent to Arkham Asylum and are made cellmates. It is suggested that Mr. Freeze tortures the Riddler in Arkham as revenge for his treachery.
* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by [[Robert Kraft]].{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} Freeze appears when the player, using a Villain character, is attempting to steal some diamonds from a Wayne Enterprises warehouse. Joker orders the player via communicator to give the diamonds to Freeze, only to later command him or her to go inside Freeze's base in Gotham Mercy Hospital and steal the diamonds back, right when Freeze is once again trying to bring back Nora and thus sabotaging the procedure. The villain player must then confront Mr. Freeze, who is enraged and willing to kill the player. Freeze also appears in the Arkham Asylum alert, where he has allied with Scarecrow and Poison Ivy to spread chaos in the Asylum, under doctor Jeremiah Arkham's orders. Freeze has taken over one of the wings in the asylum, covering the whole area with ice and snow. The team of 4 players (Heroes or Villains) must defeat Freeze one time in his area, and then face him again when he is fighting side by side with Scarecrow and Ivy.

He is a member of "The Pact," alongside [[Joker (character)|"John Doe"]], [[Riddler]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], and [[Harley Quinn]]. Unlike most iterations of the character, Freeze doesn't have his usual helmet or use a cold gun. Instead, he makes use of a specialized glove that freezes anything it touches. Freeze joins the gang to retrieve the LOTUS virus, hoping to use it to cure Nora's condition. However, during the raid at the lab where it is kept, he is betrayed by Quinn and infected with the virus. In return for information about her whereabouts, Freeze asks for the temperature of his confinements to be lowered so he can combat his infection, something which Batman/Bruce can comply with.

====Lego====
* Mr. Freeze appears ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]'', with his vocal effects provided by [[Ogie Banks]]. He appears as an enemy of [[Batman]], a follower of the [[Riddler]],&lt;ref&gt;''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery", ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.&lt;/ref&gt; and the second boss of Chapter 1 "The Riddler's Revenge." In it his design is based mainly on the animated series, and he uses his freeze gun to freeze enemies and water. The strength granted to him by his suit allows him to pick up objects others cannot. His suit also protects him from toxins. The Riddler assigns him to get a freeze cannon in his old factory. It is shown in the story that, while he aids the Riddler in his pursuit for Gotham City's Gold Reserves, he is shown to be formulating plans of his own, which involve raising an army of Freeze Maids, which he uses in his boss fight. The player has to be quick, and attack him right after he shuts down his freeze gun. After he's defeated, he attempts to run away, but Batman throws a Batarang at him, causing his pack to backfire and make him bounce across the room and then land on the floor in front of Batman and [[Robin (character)|Robin]]. In the ending cutscene, he is seen in [[Arkham Asylum]] playing with dolls of him and a freeze girl. 
* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Townsend Coleman]]. He appears as a cameo in the fourth level "Asylum Assignment" where he is seen in a cell constantly tapping on the glass. In Free-play mode, the player can actually kill him once s/he sends one of the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin's]] bombs inside and attack him. Outside of the story, he appears as a boss fight and an unlockable character found at the observatory. His intro catchphrase is, "Is it just me, or is it really cold in here?"
* Mr. Freeze appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]] through an [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] impression. He first appears as a boss in the story, on which player helps [[Plastic Man]] defeat him in the Watchtower so that they can proceed to defeat [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. The player as Batman in his Sensor-suit must attack Mr. Freeze while the character is in stealth mode. Mr. Freeze is later found in [[Qward]] in a side-quest where he requests the player to find another fuel cell for his freezer after the other was damaged by [[Killer Moth]]. The ''Batman Beyond'' version of Mr. Freeze is also playable via downloadable content.
* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', voiced again by [[Eric Bauza]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsbeat.com/sdcc18-lego-dc-super-villains-cast-and-devs-dish-on-funever-evil/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mailchi.mp/mi5communications/lego-dc-super-villains-reveals-darkseids-villainy-in-action-in-new-clip-890165?e=49aaf48973]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Batman: Arkham''====
* Mr. Freeze appears in the ''Batman Arkham'' series where he is voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]].
** In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', Mr. Freeze's frost and icicles covered cell can be seen in the Penitentiary area which can be scanned to unlock his bio. According to the game's writer [[Paul Dini]], Freeze was originally planned to be featured in the game, but his inclusion was dropped as he didn't fit as part of the game.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/6126146/Batman-Arkham-Asylum-interview-with-Paul-Dini.html&lt;/ref&gt;
** In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', he appears as both an ally to Batman and a [[boss battle]]. After the Joker poisons Batman, the Dark Knight has to find Mr. Freeze. Batman searches for him in the GCPD building (literally the coldest place in Arkham City), only to find his lab swarmed by the Penguin's men who reveal that Penguin is holding Mr. Freeze hostage in the Cryus Pinkney National History Institute. It is revealed that Penguin stole Mr. Freeze's gun and is holding GCPD officers hostage. Batman saves the hostages and Mr. Freeze from Penguin's men in the museum and asks Mr. Freeze for the cure to his ailment, only for Mr. Freeze to reveal he needs his suit, which Penguin possesses. He tells Batman that his suit has a disruptor that can be used to turn off his freeze gun so that he can defeat Penguin. After Penguin is apprehended and Mr. Freeze recovers his suit, he gets revenge by locking Penguin in a display case. Mr. Freeze then tells Batman that the cure he made for Joker degenerates too quickly and needs a restorative enzyme that has been bonded to human DNA, something that would take decades, only for Batman to reveal he knows [[Ra's al Ghul|someone]] who has been exposed to that enzyme for centuries. Mr. Freeze tells Batman he only needs a sample of this person's DNA to complete the cure, and Batman proceeds to track down one of the warriors of the [[League of Assassins]] Penguin had captured. When Batman returns to the GCPD with the blood sample, Mr. Freeze creates two vials of the cure before locking one in a safe and destroying the other, demanding Batman save [[Nora Fries]] from Joker. Batman fights Mr. Freeze to unlock the safe, which proves difficult as Mr. Freeze is much too powerful to be confronted directly. Batman is forced to hide and find ways to stun Mr. Freeze, such as using grates in the floor to surprise him as he passes by. Each time Mr. Freeze is incapacitated, he counteracts his weaknesses. After he is beaten, Batman opens the safe only to find that the wall behind the safe was broken into and in the place of the cure there is only a note saying: "Get well soon!" and some joker cards. Batman realizes that [[Harley Quinn]] had stolen the cure while the Dark Knight was distracted fighting Mr. Freeze. Mr. Freeze gives Batman freeze grenades to help him retrieve the cure, and begs him to find Nora, which becomes a side mission in the game. After Nora is saved, Batman finds Mr. Freeze with his wife and tells him to end his life of crime for Nora's sake. Mr. Freeze's boss battle was widely praised as a step up from the repetitive titan thug bosses from the previous game.
** In ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', his origins and first encounter with Batman is featured in the DLC Story "Cold, Cold Heart" which is based on the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode "Heart of Ice". Mr. Freeze also has a new design for the DLC featuring cleated boots and a larger freeze gun built into the right arm of his suit. In the DLC, Mr. Freeze is in collaboration with the Penguin's gang in order to crash a party at Wayne Manor in order to capture Ferris Boyle. When Batman arrives at GothCorp, he finds Penguin trying to backstab Mr. Freeze into giving him what Freeze is after (thinking it to be weapons) until Mr. Freeze uses his freeze gun to create a chain reaction that traps Penguin in a wall of ice. Upon getting the X-E suit to withstand the cold, and acquiring a cryogenic drill to penetrate the ice wall, Batman finds residual evidence that Boyle was behind the accident that turned Victor Fries into Mr. Freeze, and that Boyle is in possession of Mr. Freeze's cryogenically frozen wife. Batman later confronts and defeats Mr. Freeze. Boyle then takes a piece of machinery and attacks Mr. Freeze only for Batman to knock out Boyle. During the DLC's credits, a news voice-over states that Mr. Freeze, Penguin, and Boyle have been all arrested by the police.
** Mr. Freeze is featured in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]''. Mr. Freeze's freeze gun can be found in the evidence room at the [[Gotham City Police Department]]. According to Aaron Cash, Mr. Freeze hasn't been seen or heard since Arkham City and implies that he possibly gave up his criminal life to continue his work on finding a cure for Nora Fries. There was also a mentioning that the freeze gun was used by some members of the Gotham City Police Department to make ice cream until it was confiscated from them by James Gordon. Mr. Freeze appears in the December "Season of Infamy" downloadable content (DLC) pack in the side misson "In From The Cold". Batman discovers a frozen vessel just off the coast of Gotham and investigates finding Mr. Freeze at his wife's old cryogenic chamber. He says that the Arkham Knight's Militia took Nora after he refused to help Scarecrow and Arkham Knight with their plans to take down Batman. Freeze entrusts Batman to rescue his wife from the soldiers. After fighting through a barrage of Militia henchmen, Batman finds Nora and breaks her out of her damaged cryochamber. Much to both Batman and Freeze's surprise, she no longer wants to be frozen in ice and simply wants to spend time with Victor. It's also revealed that she could hear every word he said, despite being in suspended animation. After taking down a Militia force trying to destroy Fries' vessel, Nora and Victor meet face-to-face and Victor removes his protective helmet. As they look off at Gotham, Nora asks how long they will live, to which Victor replies "merely days". They then depart Gotham City; when Batman analyses Freeze's equipment in the GCPD lockup, a recording made by Cash ponders whether this turn of events is a happy or sad outcome for the Fries'.
** Mr. Freeze appears as a playable character in the mobile game ''Batman: Arkham Underworld''. He is unlocked after the player completes a mission for him, after which he becomes playable, wielding his freeze gun with different firing modes.

===Web series===
* In the third season of the [[Flash animation|Flash]] series ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', a new villain is introduced: '''Dora Smithy''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]), Mr. Freeze's sister-in-law. She blames Freeze for Nora's death, and dons his freezing equipment in a quest for revenge. As a result, there is an emphasis on Mr. Freeze himself throughout the season, and he is discussed several times, although he never actually makes an appearance.
* In the ''[[Batman Unlimited]]'' shorts, Mr. Freeze appears on a rampage in a gigantic robot suit. Batman manages to destroy the suit and Freeze ejects. Freeze then attacks Batman only for Batman to shatter his helmet. Batman puts a gas mask on him and handcuffs him, comforting Mr. Freeze until the cops arrive.

===Miscellaneous===
* Mr. Freeze appears in the direct-to-video original animation ''[[DC Super Friends]]: The Joker's Playhouse'' (2010), voiced by [[Eric Bauza]].

'''Peter LaTempa''' (1904 - January 15, 1945) was a New York mobster and associate of the [[Genovese crime family]], who later agreed to become a government witness against [[Vito Genovese]]. 

A local Brooklyn hoodlum, LaTempa was pressured to support the testimony of hitman [[Ernest Rupolo|Ernest "The Hawk" Rupolo]] in the government's case against Vito Genovese for the 1934 murder of gambler and [[Luciano crime family]] soldier [[Ferdinand Boccia|Ferdinand "The Shadow" Boccia]]. Shortly after Genovese's escape to [[Sicily]], LaTempa reportedly agreed to cooperate with the authorities because he believed that Genovese would never be prosecuted. 

However, in 1944, U.S. military police in Sicily arrested Genovese for dealing in black market goods, and his status as a fugitive was uncovered shortly thereafter. On January 8, 1945, federal authorities announced that Genovese had been repatriated to New York. LaTempa immediately went to the Brooklyn district attorney's office and demanded protective custody. As a result, the authorities placed LaTempa in [[Raymond Street Jail]]. Less than a week after Genovese's return, LaTempa was found dead in his cell after taking medication for his [[gallstones]]. An autopsy allegedly revealed that he had ingested enough poison ''"..to kill eight horses."'' Those responsible for arranging LaTempa's murder by tampering with his medication were never apprehended. However, 'authorities were convinced that Genovese was behind the murder', as he was the one who stood most to gain from LaTempa's death. 

With LaTempa's sudden death, there was no one to corroborate Rupolo's testimony in the Boccia murder case, and the jury was subsequently forced to acquit Genovese.

The presiding judge, Samuel Leibowitz, stated before the court: 

:''"I cannot speak for the jury, but I believe if there were even a shred of corroborating evidence you would have been condemned to the electric chair. By devious means, among which were the terrorizing of witnesses, kidnapping them, yes, even murdering those who would give evidence against you, you have thwarted justice time and again."''

After applying for early release from prison, Rupolo himself would be found dead almost 20 years later, on August 24, 1964. He was recovered from [[Jamaica Bay]], [[Queens]] with his hands bound and two concrete blocks attached to his legs. His murder was almost certainly in response to his having testified against Genovese.

[[Image:DomenichinounicornPalFarnese.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Quiffins resemble long-necked unicorns, except that they have no horn and can fly.  Taxonomically, quiffins are closer to [[deer]] and [[llama]]s than to [[horse]]s.]]

In [[children's literature]], the '''Quiffin''' is a mythic animal that resembles a white [[llama]] or a long-necked unicorn without a horn. 

==Characterization==
Quiffins graze in the forests of Scandinavian countries, particularly forests near the [[Oresund]] separating [[Sweden]] from [[Denmark]].  Quiffins can fly, although they prefer to walk; quiffins  can also swim over twelve miles if need be, although they are not fond of water.  Quiffins were first described in [[Hans Peterson]]'s book, ''Liselott och garaffen'', which won the 1962 Children's Book of the Year in Sweden and which was translated into English as ''Liselott and the Quiffin''.

Quiffins are ordinarily shy, but they have several properties that endear them to children whom they choose to befriend.  First and foremost, they think only good thoughts about their friends, and vice versa.  Secondly, they are elegant and graceful creatures, and comfortable in many situations, whether standing in the rain, resting in a hastily built house, or swaying in the boughs of a tree into which they have flown.  They are very obliging, and gladly perform tricks to amuse their friends.  They are also very patient, always remembering their friends and always willing to comfort them, no matter how many years have passed since their last meeting.  Finally, quiffins have cloven [[hoof|hooves]] and beautiful white [[fur]] that is warm and comforting even when wet.

In [[botany]] and [[dendrology]], a '''rhizome''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|aɪ|z|oʊ|m}}, from {{lang-grc|rhízōma|script=Latn}} "mass of roots",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|r(I/zwma|ῥίζωμα|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc-Latn|rhizóō}} "cause to strike root")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|r(izo/w|ῥιζόω}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a modified subterranean [[plant stem]] that sends out [[root]]s and [[shoot]]s from its [[Node (botany)|nodes]]. Rhizomes are also called '''creeping rootstalks''' or just '''rootstalks'''.{{Cn|date=July 2018}} Rhizomes develop from [[axillary bud]]s and grow horizontally. The rhizome also retains the ability to allow new shoots to grow upwards.&lt;ref name=Jang1148&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jang|first=Cheol Seong|title=Functional classification, genomic organization, putatively cis-acting regulatory elements, and relationship to quantitative trait loci, of sorghum genes with rhizome-enriched expression.|journal=Plant Physiology|year=2006|volume=142|issue=3|pages=1148–1159|doi=10.1104/pp.106.082891|display-authors=etal|pmid=16998090|pmc=1630734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rhizome is the main stem of the plant. A [[stolon]] is similar to a rhizome, but a stolon sprouts from an existing stem, has long internodes, and generates new shoots at the end, such as in the [[strawberry]] plant. In general, rhizomes have short internodes, send out roots from the bottom of the nodes, and generate new upward-growing shoots from the top of the nodes.

A [[stem tuber]] is a thickened part of a rhizome or stolon that has been enlarged for use as a [[storage organ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stern |first=Kingsley R. |title=Introductory Plant Biology |edition=10th |publisher=McGraw Hill |date=2002 |isbn=0-07-290941-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a tuber is high in [[starch]], e.g. the [[potato]], which is a modified stolon. The term "tuber" is often used imprecisely and is sometimes applied to plants with rhizomes.

If a rhizome is separated each piece may be able to give rise to a new plant. The plant uses the rhizome to store [[starch]]es, [[protein]]s, and other nutrients. These nutrients become useful for the plant when new shoots must be formed or when the plant dies back for the winter.&lt;ref name=Jang1148 /&gt; This is a process known as [[vegetative reproduction]] and is used by farmers and gardeners to propagate certain plants. This also allows for lateral spread of grasses like [[bamboo]] and [[bunch grasses]]. Examples of plants that are propagated this way include [[hops]], [[asparagus]], [[ginger]], [[iris (plant)|iris]]es, [[lily of the valley]], [[Canna (plant)|cannas]], and [[sympodial]] [[orchid]]s. Some rhizomes which are used directly in cooking include ginger, [[turmeric]], [[galangal]], [[fingerroot]], and [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]].

Stored rhizomes are subject to bacterial and fungal infections, making them unsuitable for replanting and greatly diminishing stocks. However, rhizomes can also be produced artificially from tissue cultures. The ability to easily grow rhizomes from tissue cultures leads to better stocks for replanting and greater yields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nayak |first1=Sanghamitra |first2=Pradeep Kumar |last2=Naik |title=Factors effecting in vitro microrhizome formation and growth in ''Curcuma longa'' L. and improved field performance of micropropagated plants |journal= Science Asia |year=2006 |volume=32 |pages=31–37 |doi=10.2306/scienceasia1513-1874.2006.32.031}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant hormones [[ethylene]] and [[jasmonic acid]] have been found to help induce and regulate the growth of rhizomes, specifically in [[rhubarb]]. Ethylene that was applied externally was found to affect internal ethylene levels, allowing easy manipulations of ethylene concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rayirath|first=Usha P|title=Role of ethylene and jasmonic acid on rhizome induction and growth in rhubarb (Rheum rhabarbarum L.) |journal=Plant Cell Tissue Organ Culture|year=2011|volume=105|pages=253–263|doi=10.1007/s11240-010-9861-y|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of how to use these hormones to induce rhizome growth could help farmers and biologists producing plants grown from rhizomes more easily cultivate and grow better plants.

Some plants have rhizomes that grow above ground or that lie at the soil surface, including some ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'' species, and [[fern]]s, whose spreading stems are rhizomes. Plants with underground rhizomes include [[Zingiberaceae|ginger]]s, [[bamboo]], the [[Venus flytrap]], [[Physalis alkekengi|Chinese lantern]], [[western poison-oak]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hogan |first=C.

Rhizomes generally form a single layer, but in [[giant horsetail]]s, can be multi-tiered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Husby |first=C. |date=2003 |url=http://www.fiu.edu/~chusb001/GiantEquisetum/Ecophysiology.html |title=Ecology and Physiology of the Giant Horsetails |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714044939/http://www.fiu.edu/~chusb001/GiantEquisetum/Ecophysiology.html |archive-date=2009-07-14 |publisher=Florida International University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many rhizomes have culinary value, and some, such as ''[[zhe'ergen]]'', are commonly consumed raw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lim |first=T.K. |title=Edible Medicinal and Non-Medicinal Plants |edition=11th |publisher=Springer |date=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-26061-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SS ''Argus''''' was a steel hulled ship lost on [[Lake Huron]] on November 9, 1913 during the [[Great Lakes storm of 1913]]. She was carrying a load of coal when she wrecked. She broke in two and sank with the loss of all 25 hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regions.noaa.gov/great-lakes/index.php/highlights-archive/centennial_anniversary_storm_of_1913/shipwrecks-damages-casualties/ |title=NOAA |accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portions of the wreckage were found by a local doctor along the shoreline at [[Bayfield, Ontario]] in mid-November 1913. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Awful Marine Disaster on the Great Lakes |url= https://pubdocs.huroncounty.ca/weblink/3/doc/160063/Page1.aspx|work=The Signal |location=Goderich, Ontario |date=November 13, 1913 |access-date=April 19, 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Salish feet.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Locations of Salish Sea foot discoveries through December 8, 2017]]

The '''Salish Sea human foot discoveries''' refers to the discoveries of multiple [[amputation|detached]] human feet on the [[Pacific Northwest]] coasts of the [[Salish Sea]] in [[British Columbia]], Canada, and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States. The first discovery occurred on August 20, 2007 on [[Jedediah Island Marine Provincial Park|Jedediah Island]] in British Columbia. In the years since, multiple detached feet have been discovered on the coasts of numerous islands in British Columbia, as well as in the U.S. cities of [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and [[Seattle]].

In December 2017, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported: "In the past dozen cases, the provincial coroner’s office has ruled out foul play... All of the individuals either killed themselves or died accidentally, with their feet naturally coming apart from their bodies during decomposition, said the coroner. ... The ubiquitous presence of running shoes might explain some of the mystery; made with light but durable materials, the shoes both protect the foot from decomposition and act as a flotation device that pulls it to the surface."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/13/canada-human-foot-british-columbia |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | title = Human foot found on Canada shoreline – the 13th such discovery in a decade |date =13 Dec 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such discoveries can be dated back a century with the discovery of a leg in a boot on a Vancouver beach in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Kwantlen Chronicle | title = Believe it or not: The Unexpected History of Three Lower Mainland Roads |date =14 January 2010 |url=http://archive.kwantlenchronicle.ca/2010/01/believe-it-or-not-the-unexpected-history-of-three-lower-mainland-roads/index.html |first=Mitch |last=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries==
As of 6 May 2018, fourteen&lt;ref name="CTV News, 7 May 2018"/&gt; feet have been found in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and five in the US state of Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2013679886_apwamysteryfoot2ndldwritethru.html|title=Tacoma police say human foot washed ashore|date=14 Dec 2010 |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=8 Mar 2011|location=Tacoma, WA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2016/02/severed-human-foot-vancouver-island/ |title=Severed human foot found washed ashore on Vancouver Island |date=10 Feb 2016|work=[[Daily Hive]] |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/british-columbia/found-foot-1.4438912 |title=Severed human foot found on Southern Vancouver Island |date=8 Dec 2017 |work=[[CBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 19 feet there are two matched pairs, one of these pairs was a woman who jumped from a bridge.  Two other feet have been identified, one as belonging to a missing fisherman and the other of a depressed man who probably committed suicide.&lt;ref name="CTV November 11, 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC June 6, 2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28088559/ns/world_news-americas/t/canada-coroner-matches-pair-mysterious-feet/ |title=Canada coroner matches pair of mysterious feet |work=[[MSNBC]] |date=6 Jun 2011 |accessdate=6 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His identity was withheld on request of his family.

These foot discoveries are not the first ones on British Columbia's coast. One was found in Vancouver in 1887, leading to the place of discovery being called Leg-In-Boot Square.&lt;ref name="Namely Vancouver: A Hidden History of Vancouver Place Names by Tom Snyders with Jennifer O'Rourke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcbookworld.com/view_author.php?id=1856 |title=O'Rourke, Jennifer|website=ABC BookWorld|publisher=[[B.C. BookWorld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 July 1914, ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' reported that recent arrivals from [[Kimsquit]] reported a human leg encased in a high boot was found on a beach near the mouth of the Salmon River (a previous name for the [[Dean River]] near Kimsquit, near the headwater of [[Dean Channel]]). It was thought the remains were from a man who had drowned on the river the previous summer.&lt;ref name="July 30, 1914"&gt;{{cite news |title=Human leg is found encased in a boot |newspaper=[[The Vancouver Sun]] |date=30 Jul 1914 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed explanations==

The series of discoveries has been called "astounding" and "almost beyond explanation", as no other body parts have turned up.&lt;ref name="Vancouver Sun May 24, 2008"&gt;{{cite news|title=A fourth foot deepens the mystery; The severed-feet explanation is 'beyond imagination,' expert says after latest find|date=24 May 2008 |page=B1 |first=Gary |last= Bellett|newspaper=[[The Vancouver Sun]]}} Original article wrote five bodies, but it has since been confirmed that two of the feet belong to the same person.&lt;/ref&gt; The discoveries have caused speculation that the feet may be those of people who died in a boating accident or a plane crash in the ocean.&lt;ref name="CBC August 31, 2007"/&gt; One explanation is that some of the feet are those of four men who died in a plane crash near [[Quadra Island]] in 2005 and whose bodies have not been recovered, though one of the feet has been determined to be from a female.&lt;ref name="CBC May 24, 2008"/&gt; [[Crime|Foul play]] has also been suggested,&lt;ref name="The Province May 23, 2008"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fourth foot fuels flotsam frenzy; Still no clues after boater's discovery in Richmond |first=Cheryl |last= Chan |date=23 May 2008 |page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although none of the first four feet showed tool marks.&lt;ref name="CNN June 19, 2008"/&gt; This does not rule out foul play, however; it is possible that the bodies could have been weighted down and disposed of, and the feet were separated due to natural decay.

Determining the origin of the feet is complicated because [[ocean currents]] may carry floating items long distances,&lt;ref name="CBC News June 17, 2008 B"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mysterious feet may be linked to single accident: B.C. forensic expert |date=17 Jun 2008 |accessdate=18 Jun 2008 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/06/17/bc-forensic-feet-connection.html  |work=[[CBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because currents in the [[Strait of Georgia]] are unpredictable.&lt;ref name="The Province May 23, 2008"/&gt; A foot may float as far as {{convert|1000|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="CNN June 19, 2008"/&gt; Also, human feet have a tendency to produce [[adipocere]] (a soap-like substance formed from [[animal fat|body fat]]), which makes it hard for forensic scientists to find clues.&lt;ref name="The Province Feb 15 2008"&gt;{{cite news |page=A3|newspaper=[[The Province]]|date=15 Feb 2008|title=Human right foot found on Valdes; This is the third foot to wash up on a Gulf Island within a year;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under optimal conditions, a human body may remain intact in water for as long as three decades, meaning that the feet may have been floating around for years.&lt;ref name="Heiman"&gt;{{cite news |date=25 May 2005 |page=A9|title=Families of victims seek expert's help |first=Carolyn |last= Heiman |newspaper=[[The Province]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory is that the feet belonged to people who died in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Asian tsunami]] on December 26, 2004. Richmond-based writer Shane Lambert said that many of the shoes found were manufactured and sold in 2004 or earlier, and that there could be other sources for the shoes or multiple sources.  However, besides the dates when the shoes were manufactured, Lambert said ocean currents and their ultimate northward tendencies up the Pacific Ocean from part of the region that was hit by the 2004 tsunami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Shane|last=Lambert|title=Human Feet in the Pacific Northwest – a Better Theory?|url=https://treepony.com/human-feet-in-the-pacific-northwest-a-better-theory/|website=Tree Pony|date=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One foot has been identified as belonging to a man who was depressed and was believed to have committed suicide.&lt;ref name="CTV November 11, 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC June 6, 2011"/&gt; Another two feet were identified as belonging to a woman who committed suicide by jumping from the [[Pattullo Bridge]] ({{coord|display=inline|name=Pattullo Bridge|49.207575|N|122.894654|W}}) in [[New Westminster]], B.C., in 2004.&lt;ref name="HuffPost 19 Oct 2011"&gt;{{cite news |title=B.C. Feet Mystery Partly Solved, As Coroner Identifies Female Suicide Victim |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/10/19/bc-feet-mystery-coroner_n_1020772.html |work=[[HuffPost]] |date=19 Oct 2011 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests the feet could belong to other people who have [[Jumper (suicide)|jumped from the bridge]] .

==Level of rarity==
[[Decomposition]] may separate the foot from the body because the [[ankle]] is relatively weak, and the buoyancy caused by air either inside or trapped within a shoe would allow it to float away.&lt;ref name="Vancouver Sun Aug 31 2007"/&gt; According to [[Simon Fraser University]] [[forensic entomology|entomologist]] Gail Anderson, extremities such as the hands, feet, and head often detach as a body decomposes in the water, although they rarely float.&lt;ref name="The Province Feb 15 2008"/&gt;

However, finding feet and not the rest of the bodies has been deemed unusual. Finding two feet has been given a "million to one odds" and has thus been described as "an anomaly".&lt;ref name="Vancouver Sun Aug 31 2007"/&gt; The finding of the third foot made it the first time three such discoveries had been made so close to each other.&lt;ref name="The Province Feb 15 2008"/&gt; The fourth discovery caused speculation about human interference and, statistically, was called "curious".&lt;ref name="Heiman"/&gt;

==Media reaction==
A newspaper article in February 2008 captured [[Jørn Lier Horst]]'s attention and he began to write ''Dregs''; while writing, the discovery of a fourth foot was made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://murderiseverywhere.blogspot.ca/2015/08/mystery-of-disembodied-feet.html| title = Mystery of the Disembodied Feet| first = Jorn Lier |last= Horst |authorlink= Jørn Lier Horst | date =19 Aug 2015| accessdate = 9 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fifth foot was discovered the story had begun to receive increased international media attention. With major headlines from newspapers such as the Melbourne ''[[Herald Sun]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', and the ''[[Cape Times]]'' in South Africa, the story elicited much speculation about the cause of the mystery, originating from "morbid fascination" with this type of subject, as stated by one scientist who identifies remains of victims.&lt;ref name="mediareaction1"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/fascinated-by-bcs-floating-feet/article44528/ | title=Fascinated by B.C.'s floating feet | first=Patrick |last= White | newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] | date=20 Jun 2008 | accessdate=2 Nov 2009 | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On his late night talk show [[David Letterman]] questioned two of his audience members who were Canadian about the mystery.&lt;ref name="mediareaction2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://thetyee.ca/Mediacheck/2008/06/26/HorrificBC/ | title=Super, Horrific BC | first=Vanessa |last=Richmond | newspaper=[[The Tyee]] | date=26 Jun 2008 | accessdate=2 Nov 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''South American lungfish''' (''Lepidosiren paradoxa'') is the single species of [[lungfish]] found in [[swamp]]s and slow-moving waters of the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]], and lower [[Paraná River]] [[drainage basin|basins]] in South America.&lt;ref name=fishbase&gt;{{Fishbase|Lepidosiren|paradoxa|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable as an [[obligate]] air-breather, it is the sole member of its family Lepidosirenidae. Relatively little is known about the South American lungfish. Additional [[common name]]s include '''American mud-fish'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The immature lungfish is spotted with gold on a black background; in the adult, this fades to a brown or gray color.&lt;ref name=SAL&gt;Animal-world: [http://animal-world.com/encyclo/fresh/Misc_PseudoBony/SouthAmericanLungfish.php South American Lungfish.]&lt;/ref&gt; Its tooth-bearing [[premaxillary]] and [[maxilla]]ry bones are fused as in all [[Dipnoi]]. South American lungfish also share an autostylic jaw suspension (where the [[palatoquadrate]] is fused to the [[cranium]]) and powerful adductor jaw muscles with the extant Dipnoi. Like the [[African lungfish]]es, this species has an elongated, almost eel-like body. It may reach a length of {{convert|125|cm|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt; The [[pectoral fin]]s are thin and thread-like, while the pelvic fins are somewhat larger, and set far back.  The fins are connected to the shoulder by a single bone, which is a marked difference from most fish, whose fins usually have at least four bones at their base, and a marked similarity with nearly all land-dwelling vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;"Your Inner Fish" Neil Shubin, 2008,2009,Vintage, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; The gills are greatly reduced and essentially non-functional in the adults.&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. |editor2=Eschmeyer, W.N.|author= Bruton, Michael N.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|page= 70|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lepidosiren paradoxa 0.jpg|thumb|left]]
[[File:Lepidosiren paradoxa1.jpg|thumb|254px|right|{{center|Female above, male below}}]]

Juvenile lungfish feed on [[insect]] larvae and [[snail]]s, while adults are omnivorous, adding [[algae]] and [[shrimp]] to their diets, crushing them with their heavily mineralized tooth-plates. The fish's usual habitats disappear during the dry season, so they burrow into the mud and make a chamber about {{convert|30|-|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} down, leaving a few holes to the surface for air.&lt;ref name=EoF/&gt; During this [[aestivation]], they produce a layer of mucus to seal in moisture, and slow their metabolism down greatly.&lt;ref name=SAL/&gt;

When the rainy season begins, they come out and begin mating. The parents build a nest for the young, which resemble [[tadpole]]s and have four external [[gill]]s. To enrich the oxygen in the nest, the male develops highly vascularized structures on his pelvic fins that release additional oxygen into the water.&lt;ref name=EoF/&gt; The young become air-breathing at about seven weeks. Juveniles have external threadlike gills very much like those of newts.&lt;ref name=SAL/&gt;

=="Secret" Prison==
[[File:Diego Garcia Island Map.jpg|thumb|A map of military installations on Diego Garcia in 2002]]
In 2008 it was exposed in [[TIME]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1828469,00.html|title=Source: US Used UK Isle for Interrogations|first=Adam|last=Zagorin|date=31 July 2008|publisher=|via=content.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; magazine by  [[Lawrence Wilkerson]] that a secret [[War on Terror]] prison had existed on the island of [[Diego Garcia]] from 2002–2006. He claimed that Diego Garcia was used by the [[CIA]] for "nefarious activities". He said that he had heard from three US intelligence sources that Diego Garcia was used as "a transit site where people were temporarily housed, let us say, and interrogated from time to time" and, "What I heard was more along the lines of using it as a transit location when perhaps other places were full or other places were deemed too dangerous or insecure, or unavailable at the moment".&lt;ref name="guardian-20150130"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/30/cia-interrogation-diego-garcia-lawrence-wilkerson |title=CIA interrogated suspects on Diego Garcia, says Colin Powell aide |author=Ian Cobain |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 January 2015 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph-20150130"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11380992/Terror-suspects-were-interrogated-on-Diego-Garcia-US-official-admits.html |title=Terror suspects were interrogated on Diego Garcia, US official admits |agency=Press Association |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=30 January 2015 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, the British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] stated that United States authorities had repeatedly assured him that no detainees had passed in transit through Diego Garcia or were disembarked there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Written Answers to Questions 21 June 2004 | journal=Hansard House of Commons Daily Debates| publisher=UK Parliament | volume= 422 | issue=part 605 | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040621/text/40621w13.htm#40621w13.html_wqn9 | accessdate=2008-02-21 | format= – &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AWritten+Answers+to+Questions+%5B%5B21+June%5D%5D+%5B%5B2004%5D%5D&amp;as_publication=Hansard+House+of+Commons+Daily+Debates&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, the [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]] of the British Parliament announced that it would launch an investigation of continued allegations of a prison camp on Diego Garcia, which it claimed were twice confirmed by comments made by retired United States Army General [[Barry McCaffrey]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{Cite news| author1=Ian Cobain |author2=Richard Norton-Taylor | url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,,2194649,00.html | title=Claims of secret CIA jail for terror suspects on British island to be investigated | work=The Guardian | date=2007-10-19 | accessdate=2007-10-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 July 2008, an unnamed former White House official alleged that the United States had imprisoned and interrogated at least one suspect on Diego Garcia during 2002 and possibly 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1828469,00.html | work=Time | title=Source: US Used UK Isle for Interrogations | date=2008-07-31 | accessdate=2010-05-01 | first=Adam | last=Zagorin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of the site was confirmed by US general [[Barry McCaffrey]], and Swiss Senator [[Dick Marty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/04/humanrights.terrorism|title=Diego Garcia: the UK's shame|date=4 August 2008|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Manfred Nowak]], one of five of the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on [[torture]], says that credible evidence exists supporting allegations that ships serving as black sites have used Diego Garcia as a base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/19/alqaida.usa |title=Claims of secret CIA jail for terror suspects on British island to be investigated |first1=Ian |last1=Cobain |author2=Richard Norton-Taylor |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human rights group [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] alleges that United States-operated ships moored outside the [[territorial waters]] of Diego Garcia were used to incarcerate and torture detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author=Jamie Doward | title=British island 'used by US for rendition' | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/02/ciarendition.unitednations | work=The Observer | date=2008-03-02 | accessdate=2008-03-27 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inmates included [[Mustafa Setmariam Nasar]], and [[Riduan Isamuddin]] was held there before being transferred to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. The United Kingdom government, who lease the island to the US, denied any knowledge of the incident, saying that two prisoners had passed through Diego Garcia but the plane they were on had only stopped to refuel. Nasar's location is still unknown since his arrival on Diego Garcia was announced in Spanish newspaper ''[[El Pais]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2008/05/18/domingo/1211082753_850215.html|title=Reportaje - Un 'yihadista' en el limbo|first=Ediciones El|last=País|date=18 May 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2014, the [[United States Senate Intelligence Committee]] published a 600-page unclassified summary of its 6,700 page secret report on the CIA's abuse of its secret prisoners.&lt;ref name="DailyMail2014-12-20"&gt;

That the island was not mentioned once in almost 500 heavily redacted pages has merely heightened suspicion of an MI6-orchestrated cover-up.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
David Jones, writing in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', expressed surprise that Diego Garcia went entirely unmentioned on every page of the unclassified summary, and speculated that pressure from UK security agencies caused the portions of the report that covered CIA prisoner facilities on the island to remain classified.

'''''The Ghost in the Machine''''' is a 1967 book about [[Theoretical psychology|philosophical psychology]] by [[Arthur Koestler]]. The title is a phrase (see [[ghost in the machine]]) coined by the Oxford philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]] to describe the Cartesian dualist account of the mind–body relationship. Koestler shares with Ryle the view that the mind of a person is not an independent non-material entity, temporarily inhabiting and governing the body. The work attempts to explain humanity's self-destructive tendency in terms of individual and collective functioning, philosophy, and overarching, cyclical political–historical dynamics, peaking in the [[nuclear weapon]]s arena.

==Overview==
In an attempt to explain human violence, Koestler criticizes the dominant conceptions of psychology of his time (behaviorism) that postulate that human behaviors are subject to the selection of the fittest. For him this theory echoed the Darwinian conceptions of the evolution of species. Koestler refutes both theories. 

The book contributes also to the longstanding debate surrounding the [[mind–body problem]] and focusing in particular on [[René Descartes]]'s [[Cartesian dualism|dualism]], in the form elucidated by Ryle. Koestler's [[Materialism|materialistic]] account argues that the personal experience of [[Mind-body dualism|duality]] arises from what Koestler calls a ''[[Holon (philosophy)|holon]]''. The notion of a holon emerges from the observation that everything in the nature is both a whole and a part.  It is true for atoms who are a whole in themselves, but also a part of a molecule, of atom who could be a whole and part of cell, of cells who are both an autonomous unity and part of an organism. It is also true for human beings who have an independent life and are part of social systems. Every holon is  willing to express two contradictory tendencies  : to express himself, and to disappear in something greater.  For human, those tendencies lead to an error in the development : we create collectives units who are based on the oppression of some individuals and on  inflated ego of others. This is for Koestler an error of transcendence that is reflected in a poor integration of our reptilian brain and cognitive brain. 

A superposition of forces manifests, at each bodily holon, as the outcome of an entire hierarchy of forces—[[Ontogeny|ontogenetic]], [[habit (psychology)|habit]]ual, [[linguistic prescription|linguistic prescriptive]], and [[social science]]—operating in a continuum of independent feedback and feedforward streams of a body extended to its larger environment. The streams are fed by the life signals of each and every group member, and this fully participative medley is the spirit of life one senses as a ghost; but this spirit is just a simplified output of a complex knowledge set; it is [[Emergentism|emergent]] from the [[Complex adaptive system|complexity]] of the group's rules and strategies. He contrasts ''his'' basic approach to the mind–body problem with [[behaviorism]]'s basic approach to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;The book is vehemently critical of [[Burrhus Frederic Skinner|B. F. Skinner]]'s [[Behaviorism|Behaviorist]] theory of [[psychology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the holon of humanity down to its roots, the work explains humanity's tendency toward  self-destruction in terms of brain structure, philosophies, and its overarching, cyclical political–historical dynamics, reaching the height of its potential in the nuclear arms arena.

One of the book's central concepts is that as the human [[triune brain]] has evolved, it has retained and built upon earlier, more primitive brain structures. The head portion of the "[[ghost in the machine]]" has, as a consequence of poor, inadequate connections, a rich potential for conflict. The primitive layers can, and may, together, overpower rational logic's hold. This explains a person's [[hate]], [[anger]] and other such [[Stress (medicine)|emotional distress]].

In ''[[Janus: A Summing Up]]'' (1978) Koestler continues the theories developed in ''The Ghost in the Machine'' and further elaborates on the concept of [[holarchy]].

An '''V1-morph''' is an organism that changes in shape during growth such that its surface area is proportional to its volume to the power 1, so to its volume. In most cases both volume and surface area are proportional to length

The reason the concept is important in the context of the [[Dynamic Energy Budget]] theory is that food (substrate) uptake is proportional to surface area, and maintenance to volume. The surface area that is of importance is that part that is involved in substrate uptake.Since uptake is proportional to maintenance for V1-morphs, there is no size control, and an organism grows exponentially at constant food (substrate) availability.

Filaments, such as fungi that form hyphae growing in length, but not in diameter, are examples of V1-morphs. Sheets that extend, but do not change in thickness, like some colonial bacteria and algae, are another example.

An important property of V1-morphs is that the distinction between the individual and the population level disappears; a single long filament grows as fast as many small ones of the same diameter and the same total length.

{{quote box|width=22em|The fire was a “raging blowtorch" .. |—Mir crewmember onboard during the fire&lt;ref name=ellis/&gt;}}

In February 1997 a Vika chemical oxygen generator failed on Mir. It caught fire and spewed a torch-like jet of a molten metal and sparks across one of the [[Mir]] [[space station]] modules, burning for around 14 minutes and blocking the escape route to the docked [[Soyuz spacecraft]].&lt;ref name=ellis/&gt; The fire was eventually extinguished, and the crew was not harmed.&lt;ref name=ellis/&gt; A definitive cause of the accident was not determined because the fire destroyed the device.

==Vika on ISS==

A backup to the temperamental Elektron system used on both the ISS and ''Mir'' is the ''Vika'' solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG), which contains a replaceable cartridge – a thin-walled steel tube with a three-part block of oxygen-releasing mixture based on [[lithium perchlorate]]. Two parts are tablets of the chemical mixture and the third one is the igniter tablet with a flash [[igniter]]. The igniter is struck by a firing pin when the device is activated. One cartridge releases {{convert|600|l|USgal}} of oxygen and burns for 5–20 minutes at {{convert|450|-|500|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molecularproducts.com/products_detail.php?id=2 Oxygen Generators]&lt;/ref&gt; The oxygen is cooled and filtered to remove dust and odours, and released into the space station atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4121">'''Warmed-over flavor''' is an unpleasant characteristic usually associated with [[meat]] which has been cooked and then refrigerated.  The deterioration of meat flavor is most noticeable upon reheating.  As cooking and subsequent refrigeration is the case with most [[convenience food]]s containing meat, it is a significant challenge to the [[Food processing|processed food]] [[Food industry|industry]]. The flavor is variously described as "rancid," "stale," and like "cardboard," and even compared to "damp dog hair."&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Frank, P. | title = Warmed-over flavor: a processing challenge | journal = Refrigerated &amp; Frozen Foods |date=March 2003 | volume = 2003 | issue = 3 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-100074391.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Warmed-over flavor is caused by the [[oxidation|oxidative]] [[decomposition]] of [[lipids]] (fatty substances) in the meat into chemicals (short-chain [[aldehydes]] or [[ketones]]) which have an unpleasant taste or odor.  This decomposition process begins after cooking or processing and is aided by the release of naturally occurring [[iron]] in the meat.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;

==Appearance of warmed-over flavor==
The appearance of warmed-over flavor begins as lipids, primarily lipids from the [[cell membrane]] of cells in the meat, are attacked by [[oxygen]].  This process is aided by the release of [[iron]] from iron-containing proteins in the meat, including [[myoglobin]] and [[hemoglobin]].  The iron is released by the heat of cooking, or by mechanical grinding. The free iron then acts as a [[catalyst]], or promoter, of oxidation reactions.  The reactions break down some of the fats in the meat to form primary oxidation products.  These chemicals are not directly responsible for the objectionable taste.  Instead, they subsequently further decompose to secondary oxidation products including "[[alcohol]]s, [[acid]]s, [[ketone]]s, [[lactone]]s and [[unsaturated hydrocarbon]]s which produce the [warmed-over flavor]."  Many of these compounds, including [[pentanal]], [[hexanal]], [[pentylfuran]], [[2-pentylfuran]], [[2-octenal]] and [[2,3-octanedione]] have a strong odor and can be tasted at concentrations as low as 1 part per billion.&lt;ref name="Trout"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jf00093a017 | title = Prevention of warmed-over flavor in cooked beef: effect of phosphate type, phosphate concentration, a lemon juice/phosphate blend, and beef extract | year = 1990 | last1 = Trout | first1 = G. R. | last2 = Dale | first2 = S. | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 38 | issue = 3| pages = 665–669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Warmed-over flavor can be prevented by the addition of [[preservatives]] to processed meat.  Many of the preservatives are [[antioxidant]]s, ranging from [[tocopherol]]s (related to vitamin E) to [[plum]] juice to industrial additives such as [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] (BHT), [[butylated hydroxyanisole]] (BHA) and [[propyl gallate]].&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;  Other preservatives such as [[sodium pyrophosphate]] and [[sodium hexametaphosphate]] may work by binding iron and preventing it from catalyzing the chemical reactions which lead to warmed-over flavor; as these compounds are generally more soluble in water than the fat-soluble antioxidant preservatives, they may be more readily used to prevent oxidative decomposition in meat.&lt;ref name="Trout" /&gt; [[Nitrite]]s, a curing agent for meat, may prevent the development of warmed-over flavor by preventing the release of iron during cooking.&lt;ref name="Igene"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0308-8146(85)90099-8 | title = Mechanisms by which nitrite inhibits the development of warmed-over flavour (WOF) in cured meat | year = 1985 | last1 = Igene    | first1 = J. | last2 = Yamauchi | first2 = K.   | last3 = Pearson  | first3 = A.

{{Tort law}}
'''Wrongful life''' is the name given to a [[legal action]] in which someone is sued by a severely [[disability|disabled]] child (through the child's [[legal guardian]]) for failing to prevent the child's birth.

==Definition==

Typically a child and the parents will sue a [[physician|doctor]] or a [[hospital]] for failing to provide information about the disability during the pregnancy, or a genetic disposition before the pregnancy.  Had the mother been aware of this information, it is argued, she would have had an [[abortion]], or chosen not to conceive at all.

== History ==

Historically, only parents could sue for their ''own'' damages incurred as a result of the birth of a disabled child (e.g., the mother's own pregnancy medical bills and cost of psychiatric treatment for both parents' emotional distress resulting from the realization that their child was disabled).  This cause of action is known as [[wrongful birth]].  But the child could not sue for his or her own damages, which were often much more substantial, in terms of the cost of round-the-clock personal care and special education.

In four [[U.S. state]]s {{citation needed|date=April 2016}} the child is allowed to bring a wrongful life [[cause of action]] for such damages.  In a 1982 case involving hereditary [[Hearing impairment|deafness]], the [[Supreme Court of California]] was the first [[state supreme court]] to endorse the child's right to sue for wrongful life, but in the same decision, limited the child's recovery to special damages.&lt;ref&gt;''Turpin v. Sortini'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C3/31C3d220.htm 31 Cal. 3d 220] (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Supreme Court of California's 1982 decision, in turn, was based on the landmark [[California Courts of Appeal|California Court of Appeal]] decision in ''Curlender v. Bio-Science Laboratories'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;''Curlender v. Bio-Science Laboratories'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA3/106CA3d811.htm 106 Cal. App. 3d 811] (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Curlender'' decision involved a child who was allegedly born with [[Tay-Sachs disease]] after the parents relied upon the defendants' representations about the reliability of their genetic tests in refraining from proceeding with [[amniocentesis]].

The most famous passage&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Blank, ''Fetal Protection in the Workplace: Women's Rights, Business Interests, and the Unborn'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993), 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel J. Kevles]], ''In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985), 293.&lt;/ref&gt; from the ''Curlender'' opinion is as follows:

{{quote|The circumstance that the birth and injury have come hand in hand has caused other courts to deal with the problem by barring recovery. The reality of the "wrongful-life" concept is that such a plaintiff both exists and suffers, due to the negligence of others. It is neither necessary nor just to retreat into meditation on the mysteries of life. We need not be concerned with the fact that had defendants not been negligent, the plaintiff might not have come into existence at all. The certainty of genetic impairment is no longer a mystery. In addition, a reverent appreciation of life compels recognition that plaintiff, however impaired she may be, has come into existence as a living person with certain rights.}}

''Curlender'' was not the first appellate decision to authorize a cause of action for wrongful life—it noted that a 1977 decision of the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|intermediate appellate court of New York]] had taken the same position, and was promptly overruled by the [[New York Court of Appeals|highest court of that state]] a year later.  However, ''Curlender'' stands as the first such appellate decision which was ''not'' later overruled.

Most other jurisdictions, including [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref&gt;''Sheppard-Mobley v. King'', 4 N.Y.3d 627, 797 N.Y.S.2d 403, 830 N.E.2d 301 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[England and Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;''McKay v. Essex Area Health Authority'' [1982] 1 QB 1166.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ontario]],&lt;ref&gt;''Bovingdon v. Hergott'', [http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/decisions/2008/january/2008ONCA0002.htm 2008 ONCA 2], 290 D.L.R. (4th) 126.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Australia]],&lt;ref name="Harriton v Stephens"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|15|2006|litigants=[[Harriton v Stephens]] |parallelcite=(2006) 226 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 52 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waller v James"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|16|2006|litigants=[[Waller v James]] |parallelcite=(2006) 226 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 136 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; have refused to allow the wrongful life cause of action.

In [[Germany]], the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] declared wrongful life claims unconstitutional. The court reasoned that such a claim implies that the life of a disabled person is less valuable than that of a non-disabled one. Therefore, claiming damages for one's life as such violates the [[Dignity#Germany|human dignity]] principle codified in the first article of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic Law]].&lt;ref&gt;BVerfGE 88, 203 (296).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|Dutch Supreme Court]] fully upheld a wrongful life claim in the [[Netherlands]]' first wrongful life case ever.&lt;ref name="MedischContact"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buijsen |first=Martin |date=3 June 2005 |title=Wrongful life-vordering gehonoreerd |trans-title=Wrongful life claim honored |journal=Medisch Contact |volume=60 |issue=22 |pages=946–948 |location=Utrecht |publisher=[[Royal Dutch Medical Association]] |language=Dutch |format=PDF |issn=0025-8245 |accessdate=23 June 2013 |url=http://medischcontact.artsennet.nl/web/file?uuid=82e949f6-a96e-43bb-a424-78810a52ba46&amp;owner=170633d1-1865-4910-ad53-77ff653599da |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527215407/http://medischcontact.artsennet.nl/web/file?uuid=82e949f6-a96e-43bb-a424-78810a52ba46&amp;owner=170633d1-1865-4910-ad53-77ff653599da |archivedate=27 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==

Since wrongful life suits are a relatively new application of human rights, doctors and scholars have not come to consensus regarding their place in medical ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lane|first1=Richard|title=Avraham Steinberg: leading light in faith-based medical ethics|journal=The Lancet|date=7 Jul 2015|volume=386|page=1723|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61218-1|url=http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(15)61218-1.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillon|first1=Raanan|title='Wrongful life' claims|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=1998|volume=24|page=363-364|doi=10.1136/jme.24.6.363|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/24/6/363.full.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have objected to wrongful life claims on conceptual grounds, including the question of whether there exist rights and duties with regards to non-existent persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mũrĩithi|first1=Paul Mũtuanyingĩ|title=Does the rejection of wrongful life claims rely on a conceptual error?|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2011|volume=37|issue=7|pages=433-436|doi=10.1136/jme.2010.042051|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/37/7/433|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eugen Ludwig Müller''' ({{lang-ru|Евге́ний-Лю́двиг Ка́рлович Ми́ллер}}&lt;ref&gt;A. Tarulis, American-Baltic relations, 1918-1922: the struggle over recognition, Catholic University of America Press, 1965, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Romanisation of Russian|tr.]] {{transl|ru|Evgeniy-Lyudvig Karlovich Miller}}; 25 September 1867 – 11 May 1939), better known as '''Yevgeny Miller''', was a [[Baltic German]] general and one of the leaders of the [[anticommunist]] [[White Army]] during and after the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917-1922). After the civil war he lived in exile in France. Kidnapped by the Soviet intelligence operatives in [[Paris]] in 1937, he was smuggled to [[Moscow]], the [[USSR]], and executed there in 1939.

==Early life==
Miller was a career officer born to a [[Baltic German]] noble family in Dünaburg (now [[Daugavpils]], [[Latvia]]).&lt;ref&gt;V. Goldin, J. Long, Resistance and Retribution: The Life and Fate of General EK Miller. Revolutionary Russia, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; After he graduated from the [[General Staff Academy (Imperial Russia)|General Staff Academy]], he served with the [[Russian Imperial Guard]]. Between 1898 and 1907, he was a Russian [[military attaché]] in several European capitals, such as [[Rome]], [[The Hague]] and [[Brussels]]. During the [[First World War]], he headed the [[Moscow]] military district and the 5th Russian Army and was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant general]].

==Civil War==
After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, Miller opposed "democratization" of the Russian army and was arrested by his own soldiers after he ordered them to remove red armbands.

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|October Revolution]] of 1917, Miller fled to [[Archangelsk]] and declared himself [[Governor-General]] of Northern Russia. In May 1919, [[Admiral Kolchak]] appointed him to be in charge of the [[White movement|White Army]] in the region. In [[Archangelsk]], [[Murmansk]] and [[Olonets]], his anti-Bolshevik [[Northern Army (Russia)| Northern Army]] was supported by the [[Triple Entente]], mostly [[United Kingdom|British]] forces. However, after an unsuccessful advance against the [[Red Army]] along the [[Northern Dvina]] in the summer of 1919, British forces withdrew from the region, and Miller's men faced the enemy alone.

==Exile==
[[File:Evgeny Miller1.png|thumb|upright|General Yevgeny Miller in 1930s]]
In February 1920, General Miller with 800 refugees sailed from Archangelsk to [[Tromsø]], [[Norway]]. Later, he moved to [[France]] and, together with [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)|Grand Duke Nicholas]] and [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel]], continued his anticommunist activism.

Between 1930 and 1937, Miller served as chairman of the [[Russian All-Military Union]], an organization of exiled former White Army officers and soldiers opposed to the Soviet Union. His niece, [[Nathalie Sergueiew]], also fled to France and subsequently became an [[MI5]] agent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svobodanews.ru/content/article/24531603.html Собачье сердце и двойной обман]&lt;/ref&gt; As the ROVS chairman, Miller was not an influential figure, as he did not belong to the dominant clan in the ROVS, namely former members of the White Army of [[South Russia (1919–1920)|South Russia]], nor the former ″Gallipoli campers″.&lt;ref name="politikaavtorit"&gt;″Врангелов неоспорни ауторитет: Из тајних архива УДБЕ: РУСКА ЕМИГРАЦИЈА У ЈУГОСЛАВИЈИ 1918–1941.″ // ''[[Politika]]'', 8 December 2017, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kidnapping==
On 22 September 1937, [[NKVD]] agent and [[Inner Line|All-Military Union counter-intelligence]] chief [[Nikolai Skoblin]] led Miller to a Paris [[safe house]], ostensibly to meet with two German [[Abwehr]] agents, who were in fact officers of the Soviet NKVD disguised as Germans. They drugged Miller, placed him in a steamer trunk and smuggled him aboard a Soviet ship in [[Le Havre]].{{sfn|Sudoplatov|1994|pp=38, 91}}&lt;ref name="politikapomirl"&gt;″Помирљивост према политичким партијама: Из тајних архива УДБЕ: РУСКА ЕМИГРАЦИЈА У ЈУГОСЛАВИЈИ 1918–1941.″ // ''[[Politika]]'', 12 December 2017, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Miller had left behind a note to be opened in case he failed to return from the meeting. In it, he detailed his suspicions about Skoblin. French police launched a massive manhunt, but Skoblin fled to the Soviet embassy in Paris and eventually was smuggled to [[Barcelona]], where the [[Second Spanish Republic]] refused to extradite him to France.&lt;ref name="OWS"&gt;Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G.P. Putnam (1945), pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the French authorities arrested Skoblin's wife, [[Nadezhda Plevitskaya]], and a French court convicted her and sentenced her to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref name="OWS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orlov, Alexander, ''The March of Time'', St. Ermin's Press (2004), {{ISBN|1-903608-05-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NKVD successfully smuggled Miller back to [[Moscow]], where he was tortured and summarily shot nineteen months later on 11 May 1939. According to NKVD General [[Pavel Sudoplatov]], "His kidnapping was a [[cause célèbre]]. Eliminating him disrupted his organization of Tsarist officers and effectively prevented them from collaborating with the Germans against us."{{sfn|Sudoplatov|1994|p=37}} Sudoplatov also notes that Western accounts of NKVD officer [[Nahum Eitingon|Leonid Eitingon]] having played a role in the abduction of Miller are false.{{sfn|Sudoplatov|1994|p=36}}   

Copies of letters written by Miller while imprisoned in Moscow are in the [[Dmitri Volkogonov]] papers at the [[Library of Congress]].

==In popular culture==
The kidnapping was the subject of a book written by [[Anatoly Rybakov]], ''The Fear''. It was also the basis of the French film ''[[Triple agent (film)|Triple Agent]]'' (2004), directed by [[Éric Rohmer]].

General Miller appears as General Fedchenko in [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s story "The Assistant Producer", in which he is betrayed by "General Golubkov".

The kidnapping of General Miller was fictionalized in [[Nikita Mikhalkov]]'s award-winning film ''[[Burnt by the Sun]]''. In the film the character known as "Mitya" ([[Oleg Menshikov]]) is a former White Army officer turned NKVD agent. Posing as a pianist in Paris, Mitya is described as having delivered eight White Generals to the NKVD. All are described as having been kidnapped, returned to Moscow, and shot without trial. One of the Generals is given the name "Weiner".
