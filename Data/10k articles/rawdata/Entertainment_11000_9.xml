'''EvoTV''' is a range of [[digital media player]]s developed by [[Amkette]] that brings internet and web2.0 features to the television.  EvoTV was envisioned to be a substitute to the growing range of [[Smart TV]]s in the market.

EvoTV is based on the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[operating system]], can connect to the internet wirelessly, and can stream local, network and internet media and audio files. Once connected users can access Android Playstore Apps using EvoTV on their television.

|[[Techtree]]

| review that "The Amkette EvoTV is a unique device that converts your boring television into a really Smart TV. While its UI displays some lag, it performs well in media playback as well as light gaming. Its Internet features, such as web browsing, social networking, streaming media, IM chat, and torrent client place it way ahead of  rival media players currently available in the market. Its motion-sensing remote control is another fun addition. Overall, this would have made for a very good buy, had the asking rate been lower. " &lt;ref name="Techtreereview"&gt;{{Cite news

Some tech jourlists deemed the first generation EvoTV to have a sluggish user interface which reduced the overall experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5899">'''Araldo Telefonico''' ("Telephone Herald" in English) was the name used for a group of [[telephone newspaper]] systems located in [[Italy]], which provided news and entertainment programming over telephone lines to subscribing homes and businesses. Beginning with the capital city of Rome in 1910, this was the most widely implemented of the various telephone newspaper operations, however, in the early 1920s, the systems were merged with, and eventually superseded by, the development of radio broadcasting.

The ''Araldo Telefonico'' employed technology licensed from the operators of the ''[[Telefon Hírmondó]]'', which had debuted as a telephone newspaper in Budapest, Hungary in 1893. Beginning in 1906, Luigi Ranieri, an Italian engineer who represented the Construction Mécaniques Escher Wyss and Company of Zurich, Switzerland, applied for permission to install systems in Rome, Milan, and Naples.&lt;ref&gt;"Nouve Applicazioni Telefoniche", ''Giornale della Libreria, Tipografia e Industrie Affini'', June 21, 1908, page 357.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1909 the Italian government authorized operations in Rome,&lt;ref name="before"&gt;"Radio before Radio: Araldo Telefonico and the Invention of Italian Broadcasting" by Gabriele Balbi, ''Technology and Culture'', October 2010, Volume 51, Number 4, pages 792.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Person to Person: The International Impact of the Telephone'' by Peter Young, 1991, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; which began service the next year, with a schedule similar to that of the ''Telefon Hírmondó's''. There was some skepticism about the practicality of the idea among the local newspapers, with one declaring: "the Romans love the quiet life and don't want to be disturbed by things that have nothing to do with them".&lt;ref&gt;"L'Araldo Telefonico", ''Il Travaso'', July 25, 1909. Quoted by Balbi (2010), page 792.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rome facility featured an extensive range of programs, running from 8:00 a.m. to late at night. Programming consisted of news, including stock exchange reports and information about the Italian Parliament, religious services, time signals, and language courses. Also featured were musical concerts, both from a local studio and via contracted prominent theaters and other establishments. The number of subscribers was 100 in September 1910, growing to 1,100 two years later, and reaching a peak of 1,315 in December 1914. A subscribers directory from 1912 listed numerous prominent individuals, including Italy's Queen Elena, plus a listening station located at the ''Camera dei Deputati'' legislative building.&lt;ref&gt;Balbi (2010), page 797.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the provisions of the authorization issued by the Italian Postal Ministry, the Rome facility was required to pay ongoing fees, but was unable to meet this requirement during the first three years of service, even after a reduction in the fee schedule. Because of this, in February 1914 the Postal Ministry issued an ordinance attempting to revoke its operating license, followed by two orders in 1915 to cease operations, but Luigi Ranieri refused to comply, and continued to operate in defiance of the government instructions. Finally, a 1917 decision by the ''Tribunale di Roma'' (Rome city court) ruled in Ranieri's favor, on the grounds that the fees were only applicable to telephone systems providing two-way communication, while the ''Araldo Telefonico's'' programming constituted "neither a communication medium nor a telephone" in the generally understood sense.&lt;ref&gt;"'Araldo Telefonico'—Non costituisce 'communicazione telefonica'—Contravenzione—Competenza," ''Rivista delle comunicazioni'' 10, no. 6 (June 1917), pages 166-168. Quoted by Balbi (2010), pages 797-798.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this legal victory, the Rome operation was suspended in 1916 due to [[World War I]]. Following the war, the Rome system was relaunched in 1922, with Luigi Ranieri now working with his son, Augusto. Additional systems were built in the city of Milan, plus, in late 1921, Bologna. 

Beginning in 1923, Luigi Ranieri began operating a radio broadcasting station, known as ''Radio Araldo''. Initially the Rome ''Araldo Telefonico'' maintained an programming advantage over radio stations, because it held the exclusive right to performances made from the best known theaters. In 1924, ''Radio Araldo'' was combined with others&lt;ref&gt;''Le parole e le figure: storia dei media in Italia dall'età liberale alla seconda guerra mondiale'' by Andrea Sangiovanni, 2012, page 125.&lt;/ref&gt; to form the broadcasting company Unione Radiofonica Italiana (URI); in 1928 the URI became [[Ente Italiano per le Audizioni Radiofoniche]] (EIAR), and finally, in 1944, Radio Audizioni Italiane ([[RAI]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Luisa Boncompagni, who, beginning in 1914, had been the announcer in charge of reading the morning news reports provided by the ''Agenzia Stefani'' press agency for the ''Araldo Telefonico'', became a prominent URI radio announcer.

In their last years the systems no longer originated their own programming, instead merely serving as relays, sending local radio programs by telephone line to homes that wanted to avoid having to purchase and maintain radio receivers.&lt;ref&gt;''Mobile Technologies: From Telecommunications to Media'' edited by Gerold Goggin and Larissa Hjorth, 2009, page 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bologna system was the last to remain operational, surviving until 1943, although by then the number of subscribers had dwindled to just 100.&lt;ref&gt;Balbi (2010), page 804.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3128">'''Atticism''' (meaning "favouring [[Attica]]", the region of [[Athens]] in [[Greece]]) was a [[rhetoric]]al movement that began in the first quarter of the 1st century BC; it may also refer to the wordings and phrasings typical of this movement, in contrast with various contemporary forms of Koine [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] (both literary and vulgar), which continued to evolve in directions guided by the common usages of [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] Greek.

Atticism was portrayed as a return to Classical methods after what was perceived as the pretentious style of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]], [[Sophist]] rhetoric and called for a return to the approaches of the [[Attic orators]].

Although the plainer language of Atticism eventually became as belabored and ornate as the [[peroration]]s it sought to replace, its original simplicity meant that it remained universally comprehensible throughout the Greek world. This helped maintain vital cultural links across the [[Mediterranean]] and beyond. Admired and popularly imitated writers such as [[Lucian]] also adopted Atticism, so that the style survived until the [[Renaissance era|Renaissance]], when it was taken up by non-[[Greek people|Greek]] students of [[Byzantine]] expatriates. [[Renaissance]] scholarship, the basis of modern scholarship in the west, nurtured strong Classical and Attic views, continuing Atticism for another four centuries.

Represented at its height by rhetoricians such as [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], and grammarians such as [[Aelius Herodianus|Herodian]] and [[Phrynichus Arabius]] at [[Alexandria]], this tendency prevailed from the 1st century BC onward, and with the force of an ecclesiastical dogma controlled all subsequent Greek culture, even so that the living form of the Greek language, even then being transformed into modern Greek much later, was quite obscured and only occasionally found expression, chiefly in private documents, though also in popular literature.

For instance, there were literary writers such as [[Strabo]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Josephus]] who intentionally withdrew from this way of expression ([[classical Greek]]) in favor of the common form of Greek.

In painting, the so-called "Parisian Atticism" is a particular movemement in French painting of the 17th century, spanning approximatively between 1640 and 1660, when famous painters working in Paris like [[Eustache Le Sueur]] or [[Jacques Stella]] elaborated a rigorous classicist style, characterized by a research of sobriety, luminosity and harmony and references to the Greco-Roman world.

'''''Bring Back Birdie''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with a book by [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]], lyrics by [[Lee Adams]], and music by [[Charles Strouse]].

A sequel to ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', it focuses on a scheme for [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roller]] Conrad Birdie, who disappeared after being discharged from the [[United States Army|U. S. Army]] twenty years ago, to make a comeback on a [[Grammy Awards]] broadcast. The musical ran on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] for four performances in 1981.

An [[cast album|original cast album]] was released on the [[Original Cast (record label)|Original Cast]] label as an LP, and subsequently re-issued on CD by [[Varèse Sarabande]].

==Plot==

===Act 1===
A story teller begins: "Once upon a time, so long ago that New York City hadn't even been bankrupt once, there lived a young man in the music business named Albert Peterson, who loved his secretary, Rose. His only client, a rock-n-roll idol known as Conrad Birdie, was being drafted into the army, and Rose wanted Albert to give up the music business, marry her, and become...an English teacher! Alas, Albert's mother--a frail and gentle old lady with many of the same endearing qualities as Snow White's stepmother--opposed the match. But love triumphed, Conrad vanished, the mother was banished, Albert married his Rose and became an English teacher and they all lived happily ever after. (Ominous chord.) Till now."

Albert and Rose are burglarizing their old office, looking for the contract that will put them on the trail of Conrad Birdie. Birdie disappeared 18 years ago, and Albert has been offered $20,000 dollars if he can get him to perform on a TV Grammy Award special, along with other giant recording stars of yesterday. Albert is eager to return to the music business, but Rose is unhappy about it ("Twenty Happy Years"). Albert is almost convinced to give up. Then Mtobe, the fly-by-night detective appears, and to Rose's disgust finds the old contract. Albert notes that Birdie is at the El Coyote Club, Bent River Junction, Arizona, and tells Rosie that they will head for Arizona immediately.

In Forest Hills, Jenny, the Petersons' 16-year-old daughter, has her own plan for leaving home ("Movin' Out" and "Half of a Couple".) Albert Jr., 14, is a budding guitarist. Rose is in the kitchen, contentedly doing her housewifely chores laden with boxes of "Cheer," "Joy," and "Yes" ("I Like What I Do").

Rose reluctantly agrees to help Albert find Conrad, but for ten days, and tells the children that they will stay in New Jersey while they are away.

In the bus terminal Albert has arranged "a spontaneous demonstration by the youth of America demanding the return of Conrad Birdie." Mtobe, who will do anything for a fee, appears to sing "Bring Back Birdie", the song Albert has written for the occasion. Rose and Albert board their bus to Tucson, believing that Jenny and Albert Jr. are on their bus to Cousin Alice's. Instead, Jenny, angry that her mother has vetoed her plan to live with her boyfriend, is intrigued by a saffron-robed lady, who says, "Come march with the Reverend Sun, sister, and find fulfillment." Jenny does. And her brother joins a punk rock band and takes off to fulfill his destiny.

In the black desert rear Bent River Junction, Arizona, while Rose struggles with their luggage, Albert assures her ("Baby, You Can Count on Me").

They find the El Coyote Club, a noisy Western saloon, site of Conrad's last gig, and the bartender turns out to be Mae Peterson, Albert's long-lost mother, who, true to form, insults Rose at every opportunity. Mae seems to know something about Conrad's whereabouts, so Albert leaves with her to consult "her files." Rose has a drink with the resident cowboys and explains why she puts up with Albert in "A Man Worth Fightin' For". After Rose does a rousing dance with the boys, Albert returns to report that Mayor C. B. Townsend might be able to help in the search.

The Mayor, a dignified, paunchy Western politician can't recall Mr. Birdie. He is sorry to cut the interview short, but he must meet with the Citizen's Committee to draft him for the Senate. As Albert and Rose turn to leave, the Mayor burps. Albert rushes back into the office. Could Conrad be the Mayor? He is. And we find out why as the Mayor sings "You Can Never Go Back".

But Albert manages to convince Conrad to try a comeback. They book him to appear at a rock concert the following night at University Stadium, and manage to cram the corpulent Conrad into the old gold suit and shove him on-stage, where he begins one of his old numbers. But the 1981 kids boo him off the stage - they've come to hear the new punk rock group Filth and don't want a 1962 retread like Birdie. Conrad, hurt, runs out.

Meanwhile, Rose has learned that her children are not at Cousin Alice's and is worried. Her concern deepens when she discovers that, disguised in pink hair and dark glasses, the guitarist for Filth is none other than Albert Jr.! Grabbing her son and interrupting the concert, Rose angrily tells Albert she's going to find Jenny, "who's gone off ringing bells somewhere," reunite the family, and go home. Albert, delighted to be back in show biz, scarcely hears her, and blithely ignores threats of million-dollar lawsuits from the concert manager and an NBC executive who is counting on Conrad for the Grammy show. Albert explains his euphoria in "Back in Show Biz Again". The first act ends with Albert in deep trouble and without Rose to help get him out of it.

===Act 2===
Albert suddenly realizes the mess he's in: he's signed a contract to deliver Conrad, who has run away, he's being sued right and left ("Middle Age Blues").

Mae appears with a tall, beautiful young woman, "I need Rose," Albert wails. "She's the only one who can help me." "Call me Rose Number Two," says the young woman, who is a combination of lawyer, financial expert, and Wonder Woman. She quickly disperses Albert's adversaries with legal skill, fast talk, and karate. Albert, rationalizing that, after all, Rose has left him, starts to fall for Rose Two.

At the compound of Reverend Sun a group of spaced-out acolytes chant and sing "Inner Peace". Rose has infiltrated their midst to rescue Jenny, and by dancing them into a frenzy manages to grab Jenny and escape.

Back in Bent River Junction, Rose Two has faked the death of Conrad to evade NBC's wrath. She fends off skeptical reporters. The "dead" Conrad sits up, drinks a beer, says he's decided to announce his passing was a mistake. But first, he's going to observe his own funeral pageant. Rose Two prevents this by locking Conrad in a closet, and we hear the Tucson Tabernacle Choir, led by Mtobe, in "There's a Brand New Beat in Heaven".

Rose returns with Jenny to find Albert completely smitten with the gorgeous and efficient Rose Two. He tells his astonished wife he's trading her in for the newer model. Instead of falling apart, Rose shows her mettle by singing and dancing the defiant "Well, I'm Not!".

Albert Jr., Jenny and their young friends comment on the craziness of their elders ("When Will Grown-Ups Grow Up?"). Albert hears this and realizes he's made a mistake. Rushing to the motel where Mae and Rose are staying, he finally stands up to his mother and demands to see Rose. "I was a jackass to ever waste my time with that other Rose, when there's only one Rose in the world I love, worship and adore," he tells her. "Just help me get Conrad through the Grammy Show and it's back to Forest Hills forever." Rose accepts. They kiss. "Rose," he yells, "I'm a tiger again!" Albert sings and dances "Young".

At the TV studio, near airtime, Conrad announces he's not going to appear. It seems that after his "funeral" he called a press conference to announce his recovery and millions of letters poured in. "The Citizens Committee decided not to nominate me for the Senate. They're gonna let me run for President instead! And it wouldn't be proper for the next President to shake it up on TV!" Consternation ensues. The NBC executive demands that Conrad Birdie "or a reasonable facsimile" be on that stage in 20 minutes or else. But no old record stars are available. Mae appears. "Would you take Delores Zepol?" she asks. "Zepol!", says Mr NBC, "the toast of the Twenties? Sure I'd take her, but she disappeared fifty years ago." Mae coyly says, "She's back." A shocked Albert says, "Mamma -- you, in show biz?" "Only until I married your father, sonny boy."

And Mae steps in and saves the Grammy show with her singing and dancing rendition of her 1925 hit, "I Love 'Em All". Albert gets his twenty thousand dollars. One surprise remains. "Zepol," muses Rose, "Unusual name." "Hungarian, I think," replies Mae. "Spelled backwards-Lopez!", says Rose. "Mae, you're - Spanish!" Mae, trapped, admits it. She embraces a very reluctant Rose as Conrad rushes on. "Albert, I couldn't let you down, old buddy! It means giving up the Presidency, but if the country can take it, so can I!"

Conrad appears the show ("Bring Back Birdie") while Rose and Albert sing "Twenty Happy Years", followed by "Rosie", the same song that brought down the curtain twenty years ago on ''Bye Bye Birdie''.

{{Nihongo foot|'''''Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker'''''|'''''Susume! Kinopio-taichō'''''|進め! キノピオ隊長||lit. ''Advance! Captain Toad''}} is an [[action puzzle video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Wii U]]. It is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series which builds upon the [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] [[minigames]] starring Captain Toad from ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' and Super Mario Odyssey. The game was announced at Nintendo's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014]] [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation and released in 2014 and 2015.

Enhanced ports were released for [[Nintendo 3DS]] and [[Nintendo Switch]] on July 13, 2018, including additional levels themed around ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'', as well as two-player [[co-op multiplayer]] in the Switch version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-03-08-captain-toad-headed-to-nintendo-switch-and-3ds|title=Captain Toad headed to Nintendo Switch and 3DS|last=Phillips|first=Tom|date=2018-03-08|website=Eurogamer|language=en-UK|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-much-requested-nintendo-switch-version-of-captai/1100-6457274/|title=A Much-Requested Nintendo Switch Version Of Captain Toad Is Finally Happening|last=Pereira|first=Chris|date=2018-03-08|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Captain Toad - Treasure Tracker E3 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot of the game from [[Nintendo]]'s [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014]] [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation]]
The game builds upon the "Adventures of Captain Toad" [[Level (gaming)|levels]] in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', where the basic [[gameplay]] model had been introduced. In the game, players control Captain Toad, a [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]], and his companion [[Toadette]] into safely navigating through various obstacles and reach a gold star at the end of each level.&lt;ref name="Does the World Need"&gt;{{cite web | title=Does the World Need Another Mario Spin-off?

The player can manipulate the camera to view around the level, which can reveal hidden areas containing bonus items. Both characters can be hit once before dying, but they collect mushrooms to restore their health. As in ''Super Mario 3D World'', Captain Toad can also walk and run, but cannot jump while carrying a heavy backpack. As in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', he can pull up plants from the ground, which yield either collecting coins or throwing turnips at enemies. He can also use Super Pickax to clear out enemies and obstacle blocks, that is similar to the hammer in ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''. The game makes use of the [[Wii U GamePad]]'s features, as the player can touch the screen to manipulate platforms, blow on the microphone to activate certain platforms, and use gyroscopic controls to aim turnips while riding mine carts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/10/5795880/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-nintendo-wii-u |title=Captain Toad from Super Mario 3D World gets his own Wii U spin-off |publisher=Polygon |date= |accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game makes use of [[amiibo]]: using the Toad amiibo places a "pixel Toad" in levels for Captain Toad to find, in the style of hide and seek; other figurines give the player extra lives.&lt;ref name="Nintendo reveals first amiibo"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo reveals first Amiibo figures and prices, but no release date | publisher=Joystiq | first=Anthony John | last=Agnello | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/08/29/nintendo-reveals-first-amiibo-figures-and-prices-but-no-release/ | date=August 29, 2014 | accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

The game opens with Captain Toad and Toadette ascending a tower together to claim a Power Star. The villainous giant crow Wingo appears and steals the star, taking Toadette along with him when she grabs hold of it. The player guides Toad as he tracks Wingo down to his lair and rescues Toadette. In the second chapter of the story, the introductory scenario plays out again, but this time Toad is kidnapped and the player assumes control of Toadette. After Toad is rescued and Wingo reemerges again, Toadette is kidnapped and Toad is knocked off of Wingo's tower. Then, the third chapter of the story begins, in which both Toad and Toadette venture through levels on their way to the showdown with Wingo, along the way defeating Draggadon, the king of Pyropuff Peak, for the third time. In the final scene of the game, the introduction to ''Super Mario 3D World'' plays out, and Captain Toad is seen following a falling Green Star into the glass pipe. For the 3DS/Switch versions, the final scene shows Captain Toad following the ''[[Super Mario Odyssey#Plot|Odyssey]]''.

==Development==
Early in the development of ''Super Mario 3D World'', Nintendo created prototypes of various gameplay ideas, including what IGN described as small "diorama-like levels the player could twist and turn." However, when the team added a character who could jump, they realized the levels would have to increase in size. They decided to keep the small-scale course design by eliminating jumping entirely, which also forced them to choose a player character other than Mario or Luigi. Director Shinya Hiratake suggested Shigeru Miyamoto to make [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] from ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' as a playable character, but Miyamoto instructed him to choose a different one. The developers then realized that Captain Toad, a background character from the ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' games, would fit the role due to his heavy backpack, which they reasoned would weigh too much and keep him from jumping. Originally, the team thought the levels could form their own game, but instead a few were included in ''Super Mario 3D World''. After ''3D World'' was finished in late 2013, Miyamoto found that the Captain Toad levels reminded him of one of his earlier gameplay ideas inspired by the [[Rubik's Cube]], so he suggested they create a separate Captain Toad game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/how-captain-toad-became-the-star-of-his-own-game | title=How Captain Toad Became the Star of His Own Game | last=Otero | first=José | date=December 2, 2014 | website=[[IGN]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203032730/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/how-captain-toad-became-the-star-of-his-own-game | archivedate=December 3, 2014 | accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also had developmental assistance from [[1-UP Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stevens |first1=Colin |title=The State of Nintendo’s Development Teams |url=https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2018/05/16/the-state-of-nintendos-development-teams/299202/ |website=Hardcore Gamer |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Treasure Tracker'' was well-received upon its reveal at [[E3 2014]]. Calling it "the best Nintendo spin-off in years," Eurogamer described the game as the lead character's "proper introduction" and "the fully-realised experience that his earlier debut [in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''] deserved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is the best Nintendo spin-off in years | first=Tom | last=Phillips | date=July 14, 2014 | publisher=Eurogamer | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-07-14-captain-toad-treasure-tracker-is-the-best-nintendo-spin-off-in-years | accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polygon declared that the game "will make you fall in love with the mine cart level," comparing some levels to a "Super Mario desert environment," and others to a "Luigi's Mansion-style ghost house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker will make you fall in love with the mine cart level | first=Michael | last=McWhertor | date=June 16, 2014 | url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/16/5816096/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-wii-u-nintendo | publisher=Polygon | accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The game received a positive reception, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; Marty Sliva of [[IGN]] stated he enjoyed the sense of discovery when looking around stages with the right-stick-controlled camera, exploring every area, and finding what he could interact with using the GamePad's touch screen. Sliva thought the variety of stages kept the game "feeling fresh" during his entire playthrough. However, he found that the use of the controller's gyroscope would cause the camera to "[spin] out of control whenever [he] moved [his] wrists," and that paging through the storybook-themed menus to find optional objectives is needlessly time-consuming.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; [[Giant Bomb]]'s Dan Ryckert thought the game was "plenty of fun" and greatly appreciated the replay value when finding the three optional Super Gems in each level, but he found the ultimate goal in each stage repetitive and that, even at an [[MSRP]] two-thirds that of a full-priced game, "the offering [felt] a bit thin." He awarded the game three stars out of five.&lt;ref name="GB"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-review/1900-691/ | title=Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker Review | last=Ryckert | first=Dan | date=December 1, 2014 | website=[[Giant Bomb]] | publisher=CBS Interactive | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202032512/http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-review/1900-691/ | archivedate=December 2, 2014 | accessdate=December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hardcore Gamer]]'s Dermot Creegan gave the game a 4.5/5, calling it a "delightful experience" and praising the level design, creativity and art direction. He criticized the forced gyroscope functionality, but was more praising of the other Wii U features saying they "succeed in bringing a dash of extra variety and creativity from time to time."&lt;ref name="Hardcore Gamer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Creegan |first=Dermot |date=December 9, 2014 |url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/12/09/review-captain-toad-treasure-tracker/122325/ |title=Review: Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker |publisher=[[Hardcore Gamer]] |accessdate=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo World Report's Curtis Bonds liked the "very tricky and clever level design" and thought that finding all the collectibles in each level was "extremely satisfying." While the game made "clever" use of the GamePad, he found the gyroscopic camera controls "annoying" and was disappointed by the game's spartan menus in addition to assets recycled from ''Super Mario 3D World''.&lt;ref name="NWR"/&gt;

'''Circassian beauties''' is a phrase used to refer to an idealized image of the women of the [[Circassians|Circassian people]] of the [[Northern Caucasus|Northwestern Caucasus]]. A fairly extensive literary history suggests that Circassian women were thought to be unusually beautiful, spirited, and elegant, and as such were desirable as [[concubine]]s.

This reputation dates back to the Late Middle Ages, when the Circassian coast was frequented by traders from Genoa, and the founder of the Medici dynasty, [[Cosimo de' Medici]], had [[Carlo de' Medici|an illegitimate son]] from a Circassian slave. During the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Persian [[Safavid]] and [[Qajar Dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties, Circassian women living as slaves in the Sultan's [[Imperial Harem]] and Shah's harems started to build their reputation as extremely beautiful and genteel, which then became a common [[trope (literature)|trope]] in Western [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Cemil Schick, ''Çerkes Güzeli: Bir Şarkiyatçı İmgenin Serüveni'' [The Fair Circassian: Adventures of an Orientalist Motif], trans. A. Anadol (Istanbul: Oğlak Yayınları, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this reputation, in Europe and America Circassians were often characterised as [[ideal of feminine beauty|ideals of feminine beauty]] in poetry and art. Cosmetic products were advertised, from the 18th century on, using the word "Circassian" in the title, or claiming that the product was based on substances used by the women of Circassia.

In consequence, most wives of several [[Ottoman Sultan]]s were ethnic Circassians converted to [[Islam]], e.g. [[Valide Sultan]]s (Empress mothers), including [[Rahime Perestu Sultan|Perestü Valide Sultan]], [[Pertevniyal Sultan|Pertevniyal Valide Sultan]], [[Şevkefza Sultan|Şevkefza Valide Sultan]], [[Tirimüjgan Sultan|Tirimüjgan Valide Sultan]], [[Nükhetsezâ Hanımefendi (wife of Abdul Hamid I)|Nükhetseza Başhanımefendi]], other important [[Khatun|Hatun]]s (Ladies) and [[Sultans]] like [[Şemsiruhsar Hatun]] and [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Saçbağlı Sultan]], [[Haseki sultan]]s (chief consorts) such as [[Mahidevran Sultan|Mahidevran Haseki Sultan]], [[Hümaşah Sultan|Hümaşah Haseki Sultan]], [[Hatice Muazzez Sultan|Hatice Muazzez Haseki Sultan]], and [[Ayşe Hatun (wife of Osman II)|Ayşe Haseki Sultan]] besides numerous [[Kadınefendi|Başkadınefendi]]s (most senior consorts), including [[Bedrifelek Kadınefendi|Bedrifelek I]], [[Biydâr Kadın Efendi|Bidar II]], [[Kamures Kadınefendi|Kamures I]], and [[Servetsezâ Kadınefendi|Servetseza I]] as well as [[Kadınefendi]]s (senior consorts) such as [[Bezmican Kadınefendi|Bezmara VI]], [[Düzd-i Dil Kadın Efendi|Düzdidil III]], [[Hayranidil Kadınefendi|Hayranıdil II]], [[Meyliservet Kadınefendi|Meyliservet IV]], [[Mihrengiz Kadınefendi|Mihrengiz II]], [[Neşerek Kadınefendi|Neşerek III]], [[Abdul Hamid II#Second marriage and issue|Nurefsun II]], [[Reftar-i Dil Hatgil|Reftaridil II]], [[Şayan Kadınefendi (wife of Murad V)|Şayan III]], amongst many others, or [[Hanımefendi|İkbals]] (honoured lady consorts), most notable of them being [[Cevherriz Hanımefendi|Cevherriz II]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Ceylanyar II]], [[Dilfirib Kadınefendi|Dilfirib I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nalanıdil III]], and [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nergis IV]] in addition to [[Hanımefendi|Gözde]]s (favourite lady consorts), including [[Abdul Hamid II|Dürdane I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Hüsnicenan III]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Safderun IV]], amongst others. The "golden age" of the Circassian beauty may be considered to be between the 1770s, when the Russian Empire seized the [[Crimean Khanate]] and cut off their slave trade in Eastern European women, which increased the demand for Circassian women in Near Eastern harems; and the 1860s, when the Russians [[Circassian genocide|destroyed Circassia itself]].

In the 1860s the showman [[P. T. Barnum]] exhibited women who he claimed were Circassian beauties. They wore a distinctive curly, [[big hair]] style, which had no precedent in earlier portrayals of Circassians, but which was soon copied by other female performers in the United States, who became known as "moss-haired girls". This hair style was a sort of a exhibit's trademark and was achieved by washing the hair of women in beer, drying it and then teasing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race, Showmen, Disabilities and the Freak Show|last=Bogdan|first=Robert|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-0-415-74393-8|location=NY|pages=200, 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear why Barnum chose this hairstyle. It may have been a reference to the Circassian fur hat, rather than the hair.

There were also several classical Turkish music pieces and poems that praise the beauty of the "Lepiska Saçlı Çerkes" (Straight, [[blonde#flaxen|flaxen]]-haired Circassian; "lepiska" refers to long blonde hair which is soft and straight, as if flatironed).

==Literary allusions==
[[File:Inspecting New Arrivals by Giulio Rosati 2.jpg|thumb|''Inspection of New Arrivals'', a typical [[orientalism|Orientalist]] fantasy painted by [[Giulio Rosati]] (1858–1917).]]

The legend of Circassian women in the western world was enhanced in 1734, when, in his ''[[Letters on the English]]'', [[Voltaire]] alludes to the beauty of Circassian women:

{{Quote|The Circassians are poor, and their daughters are beautiful, and indeed it is in them they chiefly trade. They furnish with those beauties the [[seraglio]] of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian [[Sophy (Safavid Empire)|Sophy]], and of all of those who are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain such precious merchandise. These maidens are very honorably and virtuously instructed how to fondle and caress men; are taught dances of a very polite and effeminate kind; and how to heighten by the most voluptuous artifices the pleasures of their disdainful masters for whom they are designed.|Letter XI, On Inoculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1778voltaire-lettres.html |title=Voltaire's Letters on the English |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Their beauty is mentioned in [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), in which Fielding remarked, "How contemptible would the brightest Circassian beauty, drest in all the jewels of the Indies, appear to my eyes!"&lt;ref&gt;Henry Fielding, ''Tom Jones'', book 5, ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar erotic claims about Circassian women appear in [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1818–24), in which the tale of a slave auction is told:

{{poemquote|
Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars
For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,
Warranted virgin. Beauty's brightest colours
Had decked her out in all the hues of heaven.
Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,
Who bade on till the hundreds reached the eleven,
But when the offer went beyond, they knew
'Twas for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.
|''Don Juan'', canto IV, verse 114 }}

The legend of Circassian women was also repeated by legal theorist [[Gustav Hugo]], who wrote that "Even beauty is more likely to be found in a Circassian slave girl than in a beggar girl", referring to the fact that even a slave has some security and safety, but a "free" beggar has none. Hugo's comment was later condemned by [[Karl Marx]] in ''The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law'' (1842) on the grounds that it excused slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl]], [http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1842/08/09.htm The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law]", first appearing in Supplement to the ''Rheiniche Zeitung'' No. 221, 9 August 1842. (Excerpts online)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] reported in ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' (1869) that "Circassian and Georgian girls are still sold in [[Constantinople]] by their parents, but not publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Twain |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Twain |date=1869 |chapter=34 |title=''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' |publisher=American Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American travel author and diplomat [[Bayard Taylor]] in 1862 claimed that, "So far as female beauty is concerned, the Circassian women have no superiors. They have preserved in their mountain home the purity of the Grecian models, and still display the perfect physical loveliness, whose type has descended to us in the [[Venus de' Medici]]."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Bayard |author-link=Bayard Taylor |date=1862 |chapter=Circassian Beauty |title=Prose Writings of Bayard Taylor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5HN_v61_E-cC&amp;dq=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned%2C%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned,%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;f=false |volume=7 |publisher=[[G.

==Circassian features==
[[File:Circassian woman.jpg|thumb|Circassian woman, date unknown]]

An anthropological literary suggests that Circassians were best characterized by what was called "rosy pale" or "translucent white skin". While most [[Circassians#Circassian tribes|Circassian tribes]] were famous for abundance of fair or dark blond and red hair combined with greyish-blue or green eyes,&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu&gt;{{cite book |last=Osmanoğlu |first=Ayşe |date=1960 |title=Babam Abdülhamid |location=Istanbul |publisher=Güven Yayınevi |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; many also had the pairing of very dark hair with very light complexions, a typical feature of [[Peoples of the Caucasus]].&lt;ref name=ColarussoBeauties&gt;Colarusso, John 1989.

Pp. 644-651. Page 644: "The Circassians were famed throughout the Middle East for the beauty of their women and the courage of their men. Physically most Circassians are European in appearance with perhaps a slight oriental cast to their features. Many Circassians are blond and blue-eyed, while others show a common feature of the Caucasus: very light skin coupled with black or extremely dark hair. A lithe and erect physique were favored, both for the men and the woman, and many villages even today have large numbers of healthy elderly people, many over a hundred years of age."&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Circassian women in the Ottoman harem were described as having "green eyes and long, dark blond hair, pale skin of translucent white colour, thin waist, slender body structure, and very good-looking hands and feet."&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu/&gt; The fact that Circassian women were traditionally encouraged to wear corsets in order to keep their posture straight might have shaped their [[wasp waist]] as a result. In the late 18th century, it was claimed by Western European coutouriers that "the Circassian Corset is the only one which displays, without indelicacy, the shape of the bosom to the greatest possible advantage; gives a width to the chest which is equally conducive to health and elegance of appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morison |first=Stanley |author-link=Stanley Morison |year=2009 |orig-year=1930 |chapter=The Fair Circassian |title=[[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]], 1745–1831: A Memoir |format=Paperback |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |publication-date=November 2009 |page=70 |isbn=978-0-521-14314-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maturin Murray Ballou]] described Circassians as being of the "fair and rosy-cheeked race," and "with a form of ravishing loveliness, large and lustrous eyes, and every belonging that might go to make up a Venus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ballou |first=Maturin Murray |author-link=Maturin Murray Ballou |date=1851 |title=The Circassian Slave, or, the Sultan's Favorite: A Story of Constantinople and the Caucasus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOhEAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=circassian%20ebony&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=fair%20and%20rosy-cheeked%20Circassian%20race&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Frederick Gleason]] |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''A Year Among the Circassians'', John Augustus Longworth describes a Circassian girl of typical Circassian features as the following: "She had regular and pretty features, blue eyes, and fair complexion; her hair was of a light auburn colour, and hung in a profusion of braided tresses over her shoulders, from a bonnet of scarlet cloth, trimmed and crossed with broad silver lace, not unlike the Albanian skull-cap. She was tall, and well, though slightly, shaped; and held herself, like all Circassians, men or women, very erect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Longworth, Esq. |first=John Augustus |date=1840 |title=A Year Among the Circassians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYGeRLRf7xsC&amp;dq=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features%2C%20blue%20eyes%2C%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features,%20blue%20eyes,%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=Henry Colburn |volume=1 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also understood from the memoirs of Princess Emily Ruete, a half-Circassian and half-Omani herself, that Circassian women, who were captured in Constantinople and brought to Africa for the harem of Zanzibari [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman]], were envied by their rivals who considered Circassians to be of the "hateful race of blue-eyed cats."

{{Quote|At [[Sultan's Palace, Zanzibar|Bet il Sahel]] there was much more luxury and grand style than at Bet il Mtoni. The handsome and graceful Circassian women were much more numerous than at Bet il Mtoni, where my mother and her lady friend Medîne were the only members of this race. Here the majority of the women were Circassian, who without any doubt are much more distinguished in appearance....This natural superiority was the cause of a good deal of ill-will and envy. One Circassian woman, favoured with an aristocratic appearance, was avoided and even hated by the chocolate-coloured Abyssinian women through no fault of hers, but simply because she looked majestic. Under these circumstances it was bound to happen that occasionally a kind of ridiculous "racism" broke out among my brothers and sisters....We, the children of Circassian women, were usually called "cats" by those of our brothers and sisters who had Abyssinian blood in their veins, because some of us had the misfortune of possessing: blue eyes. Derisively they called us "Highness", a proof of how annoyed they were about us having been born with lighter skin. My father was of course never forgiven the fact that he had chosen his favourite children Sharîfe and Chole—both by Circassian mothers, Sharîfe even being blue-eyed—from the hateful race of "cats".&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruete |first=Princess Emily |author-link=Emily Ruete |date=1993 |original-date= |title=An Arabian Princess Between Two Worlds: Memoirs, Letters Home, Sequels to the Memoirs |chapter=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mU2w8K8IyoEC&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;f=false |editor=E.

Regarding one of her half-sisters who was also from a Circassian mother, Princess Ruete of Zanzibar mentions that, "The daughter of a Circassian was a dazzling beauty with the complexion of a German blonde. Besides, she possessed a sharp intellect, which made her into a faithful advisor of my father's."&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"/&gt;

The characteristics of Circassian and Northwest Georgian women were further articulated in 1839 by the author Emma Reeve who, as stated by Joan DelPlato, differentiated "between 'the blond Circassians' who are 'indolent and graceful, their voices low and sweet' and what she calls the slightly darker-skinned Georgians who are 'more animated' and have more 'intelligence and vivacity than their delicate rivals'."&lt;ref name="DelPlato"&gt;{{cite book |last=DelPlato |first=Joan |date=2002 |chapter=Chapter 2.

Similar descriptions of the Circassian women appear in [[Florence Nightingale]]'s travel journal where Nightingale called Circassians "the most graceful and the most sensual-looking creatures I ever saw".&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

According to the feminist [[Harriet Martineau]], Circassians were the only saving virtue of the Egyptian harem where these Circassian mothers produced the finest children and if they were to be excluded from the harem, the upper class in Egypt would be doomed.&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

In parts of Europe and North America where blond hair was more common, the pairing of extremely white skin with very dark hair also present among some Circassians was exalted, even in Russia which was [[Russo-Circassian War|at war with the Circassians]]; Semyon Bronevskii exalted Circassian women for having light skin, dark brown hair, dark eyes and "the lineaments of the face of the Ancient Greek".&lt;ref&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 135&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the girls disguised as "Circassians" exhibited by [[Phineas T. Barnum]] were in fact Catholic [[Irish people|Irish girls]] from [[Lower Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=King139&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Circassian men were also exalted for their beauty, manliness and bravery in Western Europe, in a way Caucasus historian Charles King calls "homoerotic".&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 134&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]], in 1862, Circassian chiefs arrived to advocate their cause against Russia and to persuade Britain to stop the [[Circassian genocide|actions of the Russian army at that time]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosser-Owen (2007)."The First 'Circassian Exodus' to the Ottoman Empire (1858-1867)". Page 46&lt;/ref&gt; and upon the arrival of two Circassian leaders, Hadji Hayder Hassan and Kustan Ogli Ismael, the ''Dundee Advertiser'' reported that "the Chiefs are two remarkable looking men. Their imposing bearing, their romantic dress... and their natural dignity of mien, stamp them as very superior... Raven haired, black-bearded, broad-browed, with wide springing eyebrows of sooty black... these bronzed and armed children of the mountains tend to put us out of love with our own specimens of men, and suggests thoughts not complementary to the types of manhood which, in this country, they are surrounded."&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic/&gt;

===Pseudoscientific explanations for the extreme white skin===
During the 19th century, various Western intellectuals offered [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] explanations for the light complexion present among Circassians. The [[doctor of medicine]] [[Hugh Williamson]], a signatory to the [[United States Constitution]], argued that the reason for the extreme whiteness of the Circassian and coastal [[Celtic people|Celto]]-[[Germanic peoples]] can be explained by the geographical [[Location (geography)|location]] of these folks' ancestral homelands which lie in high latitudes ranging from 45° to 55° N near a sea or ocean where [[Prevailing Westerlies|Westerlies]] prevail from the west towards the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Williamson |date=1811 |title=Observations of the Climate in different parts of America, compared with the Climate in corresponding Parts of the other Continent |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|There are not any people, on the old continent, perfectly fair, except those who live in high latitudes, where the westerly winds come from the sea, at no great distance, so tempered as not to be very sharp nor very dry. This rule applies to Great Britain and Ireland, to the Germans, Danes, Swedes, and Circassians; but going to the eastward in the same latitude, as we depart from the ocean or the Black Sea, having more dry land to the windward, by which the air is charged with sun-dry exhalations, the skin changes its colour; it ceases to be perfectly fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-last=Tilloch |editor1-first=Alexander |editor1-link=Alexander Tilloch |editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-link=Richard Taylor (editor) |date=1816 |title=XLIV.

==Pseudoscientific racialist theories==
By the early nineteenth century, Circassians were associated with theories of racial hierarchy, which elevated the Caucasus region as the source of the purest examples of the "white race", which was named the [[Caucasian race]] after the area by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]. Blumenbach theorised that the Circassians were the closest to God's original model of humanity, and thus "the purest and most beautiful whites were the Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop Jordan, ''White over Black'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1968, pp. 222–3&lt;/ref&gt; This fuelled the idea of female Circassian beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/searchlm.php?function=find&amp;exhibit=star&amp;browse=star |title=The Circassian Beauty Archive |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, the decade after the expulsion of Circassians from the Caucasus where only a minority of them live today, it was argued that "the Caucasian Race receives its name from the Caucasus, the abode of the Circassians who are said to be the handsomest and best-formed nation, not only of this race, but of the whole human family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cornell |first=Sarah S. |date=1873 |title=Cornell's Physical Geography: Accompanied with Nineteen Pages of Maps, a Great Variety of Map-questions, and One Hundred and Thirty Diagrams and Pictorial Illustrations, and Embracing a Detailed Description of the Physical Features of the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6waAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Caucasian%20Race%20receives%20its%20name%20from%20the%20Caucasus&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20abode%20of%20the%20Circassians,%20who%20are%20said%20to%20be%20the%20handsomest%20and%20best-formed%20nation,%20not%20only%20of%20this%20race,%20but%20of%20the%20whole%20human%20family&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] and [[D. Appleton &amp; Company]] |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another anthropologist [[William Guthrie (historian)|William Guthrie]] distinguished the Caucasian race and the "Circassians who are admired for their beauty" in particular by their oval form of their head, straight nose, thin lips, vertically-placed teeth, facial angle from 80 to 90 degrees that he calls the most developed one, and their regular features overall, which "causes them to be considered as the most handsome and agreeable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=William |author-link=William Guthrie (historian) |date=1843 |title=A new geographical, historical, and commercial grammar |editor=Richard Alfred Davenport |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bayard Taylor]] observed the Circassian women during his trip to the Ottoman Empire and argued that, "the Circassian face is a pure oval; the forehead is low and fair, an excellent thing in woman, and the skin of an ivory whiteness, except the faint pink of the cheeks and the ripe, roseate stain of the lips."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"/&gt;

Circassians are depicted in images of harems at this time through these ideologies of racial hierarchy. [[John Frederick Lewis]]'s ''The Harem'' portrays Circassians as the dominant mistresses of the harem, who look down on other women, as implied in the review of the painting in ''[[The Art Journal]]'', which described it as follows,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It represents the interior of a harem at Cairo, wherein is seated in luxurious ease a young Turk, attired in the excess of Moslem fashion. Near him, and reclining upon cushions, are two Circassian women, also dressed in the extremity of Oriental taste... On the right is seen a tall Nubian eunuch, who removes from the shoulders of an Egyptian slave the shawl by which she had been covered, in order to show her to the master of the harem; this figure with her high shoulders and the characteristics of her features, is a most successful national impersonation. The Circassian women look languidly to the Egyptian with an expression of supreme contempt, which is responded to by a sneer on the face of the Nubian eunuch.&lt;ref&gt;''Art Journal'', Review of the Old Water-colour Society Exhibition, 1850&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Orientalizing paintings of nudes were also sometimes exhibited as "Circassians".

The Circassians became major news during the [[Caucasian War]], in which [[Russia]] conquered the North Caucasus, displacing large numbers of Circassians southwards. In 1856 ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a report entitled "Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women — Infanticide in Turkey", asserting that a consequence of the Russian conquest of the Caucasus was an excess of beautiful Circassian women on the [[Constantinople]] slave market, and that this was causing prices of slaves in general to plummet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/311/ Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women—Infanticide in Turkey]; ''New York Daily Times'', 6 August 1856&lt;/ref&gt; The story drew on ideas of racial hierarchy, stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The temptation to possess a Circassian girl at such low prices is so great in the minds of the Turks that many who cannot afford to keep several slaves have been sending their blacks to market, in order to make room for a newly purchased white girl.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article also claimed that children born to the "inferior" black concubines were being killed. This story drew widespread attention to the area, as did later conflicts.

At the same time writers and illustrators were also creating images depicting the authentic costumes and people of the Caucasus. [[Francis Davis Millet]] depicted Circassian women during his 1877 coverage of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish war]], specifying local costume and hairstyle.

==Advertising of beauty products==
[[File:Circassian hair dye.jpg|thumb|A poster from c. 1843 advertising Circassian Hair Dye]]

An advertisement from 1782 titled "Bloom of Circassia" makes clear that it was by then well established "that the Circassians are the most beautiful Women in the World", but goes on to reveal that they "derive not all their Charms from Nature". They used a concoction supposedly extracted from a vegetable native to Circassia. Knowledge of this "Liquid Bloom" had been brought back by a "well-regarded gentleman" who had traveled and lived in the region. It "instantly gives a Rosy Hue to the Cheeks", a "lively and animated Bloom of Rural Beauty" that would not disappear in perspiration or handkerchiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom of Circassia, ''New-York Gazette'', 2 September 1782&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 "the Balm of Mecca" was also marketed as being used by Circassians: "This delicate as well as fragrant composition has been long celebrated as the summit of cosmetics by all the Circassian and Georgian women in the seraglio of the Grand Sultan". It claims that the product was endorsed by Lady [[Mary Wortley Montague]] who stated that it was very helpful "for removing those sebacious impurities so noxious to beauty". The article continues: "Any lady must be as great an Infidel as the Grand Sultan himself, who, after receiving such authority can doubt that her skin will become as superlatively smooth, soft, white and delicate, as that of the lovely Fatima, whatever may have been its feel or its appearance before. What fair one but must yield implicit faith, when she has the honour of the Countess De --- fairly pledged, that all sepacious [sic] impurities will be at once removed by this wonder-working nostrum. And above all, who but must long for an article, from the seraglio of the Grand Turk, which produces a near resemblance to the Georgian and Circassian beauties?"&lt;ref&gt;To the Ladies, ''New-York Herald'', 14 July 1802&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Lotion" was sold in 1806 for the skin, at fifty cents the bottle. "A sovereign remedy for surfeits, scorching from the heat of the sun, freckles, blights from cold and chills of winter, scorbutic, pimples or eruptions of the face and skin, however violent or disfigured, animalcula generated under the cuticle or outer skin, prickley heat, shingles, ring worms, redness of the nose and chin, obstinate cutaneous diseases, and for every impurity or unnatural appearance with which the skin may be affected; to be used as a common wash for clearing and improving the complexion, and in a superior degree to preserve, soften, cleanse and beautify the skin".&lt;ref&gt;''Morning Chronicle' (NYC), 20 September 1806&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Eye-Water" was marketed as "a sovereign remedy for all diseases of the eyes",&lt;ref&gt;Delaware Gazette and State Journal, 2 February 1815&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1840s "Circassian hair dye" was marketed to create a rich dark lustrous effect.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M Barrett (1998), Southern Living (in Captivity): The Caucasus in Russian Popular Culture, ''The Journal of Popular Culture'' 31 (4), 75–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nineteenth-century sideshow attraction==
[[Image:Circassian.jpg|thumb|As a sideshow attraction, Circassian beauties were women with [[big hair]], a reference to the teased hair they wore, held in place by beer. Circassian ancestry was not required as in this example.]]

The combination of the popular issues of [[slavery]], the [[Orient]], racial ideology, and sexual titillation gave the reports of Circassian women sufficient notoriety at the time that the [[circus]] leader [[P. T. Barnum]] decided to capitalize on this interest. He displayed a "Circassian Beauty" at his [[Barnum's American Museum|American Museum]] in 1865. Barnum's Circassian beauties were young women with tall, teased hairstyles, rather like the [[Afro]] style of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lind"&gt;Linda Frost, ''Never one nation: freaks, savages, and whiteness in U.S. popular culture, 1850–1877'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2005, pp. 68–88&lt;/ref&gt; Actual Circassian hairstyles bore no resemblance to Barnum's fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/23800/23851/Circassian_23851.htm |title=Circassian |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum's first "Circassian" was marketed under the name "[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/344/ Zalumma Agra]" and was exhibited at his American Museum in New York from 1864. Barnum had written to John Greenwood, his agent in Europe, asking him to purchase a beautiful Circassian girl to exhibit, or at least to hire a girl who could "pass for" one. However, it seems that "Zalumma Agra" was probably a local girl hired by the show, as were later "Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]], ''Freakery: Cultural Spectacles of the Extraordinary Body'', [[New York University Press]], 1996, pp. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum also produced a booklet about another of his Circassians, Zoe Meleke, who was portrayed as an ideally beautiful and refined woman who had escaped a life of sexual slavery.

The portrayal of a white woman as a rescued slave at the time of the [[American Civil War]] played on the racial connotations of slavery at the time. It has been argued that the distinctive hairstyle affiliates the side-show Circassian with African identity, and thus,

&lt;blockquote&gt;resonates oddly yet resoundingly with the rest of her identifying significations: her racial purity, her sexual enslavement, her position as colonial subject; her beauty. The Circassian blended elements of white Victorian True Womanhood with traits of the enslaved African American woman in one curiosity.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The trend spread, with supposedly Circassian women featured in [[dime museum]]s and travelling [[medicine show]]s, sometimes known as "Moss-haired girls". They were typically identified by the distinctive hairstyle, which was held in place by the use of beer. They also often performed in pseudo-oriental costume. Many postcards of Circassians also circulated. Though Barnum's original women were portrayed as proud and genteel, later images of Circassians often emphasised erotic poses and revealing costumes.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt; As the original fad faded, the "Circassians" started to add to their appeal by performing traditional circus tricks such as [[sword swallowing]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bogdan, ''Freak Show: Presenting Human Oddities for Amusement and Profit'', [[University of Chicago Press]], 1990, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of the classical style ==

=== Early narrative film (1895–1913) ===
For centuries, the only visual standard of narrative storytelling was the theatre. Since the first narrative films in the 1890s, film-makers sought to capture the power of live theatre on the cinema screen. Most of these film-makers started as directors on the late 19th century stage, and likewise most film actors had roots in vaudeville or theatrical melodramas. Visually, early narrative films had adapted little from the stage, and their narratives had adapted very little from vaudeville and melodrama. Before the visual style which would become known as "classical continuity", scenes were filmed in full shot and used carefully choreographed staging to portray plot and character relationships. Cutting was extremely limited, and mostly consisted of close-ups of writing on objects for their legibility.&lt;ref name="davidbordwell.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2007/12/28/happy-birthday-classical-cinema/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222103312/http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2007/12/28/happy-birthday-classical-cinema/ |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maturation of the silents (1913–late 1920s) ===
[[File:The Mothering Heart.jpg|thumb|''The Mothering Heart'' screenshot]]
Though lacking the reality inherent to the stage, film (unlike stage) offers the freedom to manipulate apparent time and space, and thus to create the illusion of realism — that is temporal linearity and spatial continuity. By the early 1910s, film-making was beginning to fulfill its artistic potential. In Sweden and Denmark, this period would be known as a "Golden Age" of film;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Romantic-Comedy-Yugoslavia/Sweden-THE-GOLDEN-AGE-OF-SILENT-FILM.html|title=The "golden age" of silent film – Sweden – bio, actress, children, wife, cinema, role, story|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in America, this artistic change is attributed to film-makers like [[D.W. Griffith|David W. Griffith]] finally breaking the grip of the Edison Trust to make films independent of the manufacturing monopoly. Films worldwide began to noticeably adopt visual and narrative elements which would be found in classical Hollywood cinema. [[1913 in film|1913]] was a particularly fruitful year for the medium, as pioneering directors from several countries produced masterpieces such as ''[[The Mothering Heart]]'' (D. W. Griffith), ''[[Ingeborg Holm]]'' ([[Victor Sjöström]]), and ''L'enfant de Paris'' ([[Léonce Perret]]) that set new standards for film as a form of storytelling.&lt;ref name="davidbordwell.net"/&gt; It was also the year when [[Yevgeni Bauer]] (the first true film artist, according to [[Georges Sadoul]]&lt;ref&gt;Georges Sadoul. Всеобщая история кино. — Moscow, Iskustvo, 1958. — Т. 3. — page 178&lt;/ref&gt;) started his short, but prolific, career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gildasattic.com/bauer.html]
Evgenii Bauer (1865-1917)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the world, generally and America specifically, the influence of Griffith on film-making was unmatched. Equally influential were his actors in adapting their performances to the new medium. [[Lillian Gish]], the star of ''The Mothering Heart'', is particularly noted for her influence on screen performance techniques. Griffith's [[1915 in film|1915]] epic ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' was ground-breaking for film as a means of storytelling — a masterpiece of literary narrative with numerous innovative visual techniques. The film initiated so many advances in American cinema that it was rendered obsolete within a few years.&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, Kevin (1968). ''The Parade's Gone By...'', University of California Press, p. 78. {{ISBN|0-520-03068-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though 1913 was a global landmark for film-making, 1917 was primarily an American one.

The era of "classical Hollywood cinema" is distinguished by a narrative and visual style which would begin to dominate the medium in America by 1917.

=== Classical Hollywood cinema in the sound era (late 1920s – 1960s) ===

The narrative and visual style of classical Hollywood style would further develop after the transition to sound-film production. The primary changes in American film-making came from the film industry itself, with the height of the [[studio system]]. This mode of production, with its reigning star system bankrolled by several key studios, had preceded sound by several years. By mid-1920, most of the prominent American directors and actors, who had worked independently since the early 10s, would have to become a part of the new studio system to continue to work.

The beginning of the sound era itself is ambiguously defined. To some, it began with ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', which was released in 1927 and increased box-office profits for films, as sound was introduced to feature films. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american-historama.org/1929-1945-depression-ww2-era/golden-age-of-hollywood.htm Golden Age of Hollywood: Movies, Actors and Actresses***]&lt;/ref&gt; To others, the era began in 1929, when the silent age had definitively ended. &lt;ref&gt;[https://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1051&amp;context=etd_hon_theses Expressive Experimentalism in Silent Cinema 1926-1929-Lucia Maria Pier]&lt;/ref&gt; Most Hollywood pictures from the late 1920s to 1960s adhered closely to a genre—Western, [[slapstick]] comedy, musical, animated cartoon, and [[Biographical film|biopic]] (biographical picture)—and the same creative teams often worked on films made by the same studio. For instance, [[Cedric Gibbons]] and [[Herbert Stothart]] always worked on [[MGM films]]; [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]] worked at [[Twentieth Century Fox]] for twenty years; [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s films were almost all made at [[Paramount Pictures]]; and director [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]]'s films were mostly made for Twentieth Century Fox. Similarly, actors were mostly contract players. Film historians and critics note that it took about a decade for films to adapt to sound and return to the level of artistic quality of the silents, which it did in the late 1930s.

Many great works of cinema that emerged from this period were of highly regimented film-making. One reason this was possible is that, with so many films being made, not every one had to be a big hit. A studio could gamble on a medium-budget feature with a good script and relatively unknown actors: ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', directed by [[Orson Welles]] and regarded by some as the greatest film of all time, fits that description. In other cases, strong-willed directors like [[Howard Hawks]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], and [[Frank Capra]] battled the studios in order to achieve their artistic visions. The apogee of the studio system may have been the year 1939, which saw the release of such classics as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'', ''[[Young Mr. Lincoln]]'', ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'', ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'', ''[[Ninotchka]]'', ''[[Beau Geste (1939 film)|Beau Geste]]'', ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'', ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'', ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939 film)|Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'', and ''[[The Roaring Twenties]]''.

}}
The visual-narrative style of classical Hollywood cinema as elaborated by [[David Bordwell]],&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, David; Staiger, Janet; Thompson, Kristin (1985): The Classical Hollywood Cinema. Film Style &amp; Mode of Production to 1960. New York: Columbia University Press. 1–59&lt;/ref&gt; was heavily influenced by the ideas of the [[Renaissance]] and its resurgence of mankind as the focal point. It is distinguished at three general levels: devices, systems, and the relations of systems.

=== Devices ===
The devices most inherent to classical Hollywood cinema are those of [[continuity editing]]. This includes the [[180-degree rule]], one of the major visual-spatial elements of continuity editing. The 180-degree rule keeps with the "photographed play" style by creating an imaginary 180-degree axis between the viewer and the shot, allowing viewers to clearly orient themselves within the position and direction of action in a scene. According to the [[30-degree rule]], cuts in the angle that the scene is viewed from must be significant enough for the viewer to understand the purpose of a change in perspective. Cuts that do not adhere to the 30-degree rule, known as [[jump cut]]s, are disruptive to the illusion of temporal continuity between shots. The 180-degree and 30-degree rules are elementary guidelines in film-making that preceded the official start of the classical era by over a decade, as seen in the pioneering [[1902 in film|1902]] French film ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''. Cutting techniques in classical continuity editing serve to help establish or maintain continuity, as in the [[cross cutting|cross cut]], which establishes the concurrence of action in different locations. Jump cuts are allowed in the form of the [[axial cut]], which does not change the angle of shooting at all, but has the clear purpose of showing a perspective closer or farther from the subject, and therefore does not interfere with temporal continuity.

=== Systems ===

==== Narrative logic ====
Classical narration progresses always through psychological motivation, i. e., by the will of a human character and its struggle with obstacles towards a defined goal. This narrative element is commonly composed of a primary narrative (often a romance) intertwined with a secondary narrative, such as a business or a crime. This narrative is structured with an unmistakable beginning, middle and end, and generally there is a distinct resolution. Utilizing actors, events, causal effects, main points, and secondary points are basic characteristics of this type of narrative. The characters in Classical Hollywood Cinema have clearly definable traits, are active, and very goal oriented. They are causal agents motivated by psychological rather than social concerns.&lt;ref name="goldburg1" /&gt; The narrative is a chain of cause and effect with the characters being the causal agents — in classical style, events do not occur randomly.

==== Cinematic time ====
Time in classical Hollywood is continuous, linear, and uniform, since [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linearity]] calls attention to the illusory workings of the medium. The only permissible manipulation of time in this format is the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]. It is mostly used to introduce a memory sequence of a character, e. g., ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''.

==== Cinematic space ====
The greatest rule of classical continuity regarding space is object permanence: the viewer must believe that the scene exists outside the shot of the cinematic frame to maintain the picture's realism. The treatment of space in classical Hollywood strives to overcome or conceal the two-dimensionality of film ("invisible style") and is strongly centered upon the human body. The majority of shots in a classical film focus on [[gesture]]s or [[facial expression]]s (medium-long and [[medium shot]]s). [[André Bazin]] once compared classical film to a photographed play in that the events seem to exist objectively and that cameras only give us the best view of the whole play.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell: 24&lt;/ref&gt;

This treatment of space consists of four main aspects: centering, balancing, frontality, and depth. Persons or objects of significance are mostly in the center part of the picture [[Film frame|frame]] and never out of focus. Balancing refers to the visual composition, i. e., characters are evenly distributed throughout the frame. The action is subtly addressed towards the spectator (frontality) and [[Set construction|set]], lighting (mostly [[three-point lighting]], especially [[high-key lighting]]), and costumes are designed to separate foreground from the background (depth).

=== Relations of systems ===
The aspects of space and time are subordinated to the narrative element.

==History==
The company was founded in 1991. In 1992, the first anime series distributed by Cloverway for [[Latin America]] was the [[Saint Seiya|Knights of the Zodiac]] TV series, first broadcast in Mexico and Brazil. It was followed by [[Sailor Moon]] and [[Dragon Ball]] some time later.

In 1995, [[Dragon Ball]] was re-dubbed by Cloverway, after Bandai{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} failed distributing their first episodes and a movie, dubbed under the title of "Zero y el dragón mágico" ("Zero and the magic dragon", based on the [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]] version&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180805225739/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b-MnRSJo-o&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/youtube-WsW5yYsjSXU&lt;/ref&gt;).

Generally, Cloverway commissioned [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] for the Spanish versions to the company '''[[:es:Intertrack|Intertrack]]''' (until its closure in 2005, later on to Optimedia Productions in 2006) in Mexico, and the Brazilian versions to '''[[:pt:Álamo_(empresa)|Álamo]]''' (except for [[Sailor Moon]] and [[Yu Yu Hakusho]]) in [[São Paulo]] Brazil, while some other works were dubbed into Spanish through Cloverway's arrangements with Televisa's owned [[:es:Audiomaster 3000|Audiomaster 3000]] in Mexico. Other Cloverway's arrangements were made with [[International Telefilms Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernán_Schmidt_Fuentes#Telefilms&lt;/ref&gt; for first-run syndication broadcasting in Chile ([[ETC (Chilean TV network)|ETC TV]] and [[Chilevisión|CHV]]) and Spanish dubbing recorded by [[:es:Technoworks Ltda|Technoworks/HispanoAmérica Doblajes]] in [[Santiago]]. As for the series owned by [[TMS Entertainment|TMS]], Spanish versions were already dubbed by [[Point 360|VDI Multimedia]] in [[Los Angeles]] and previously distributed by other companies, but Brazilian versions were never produced and Cloverway couldn't get a deal for them to be dubbed and broadcast in Brazil. Also, Spanish versions of [[The New Adventures of Kimba The White Lion|Kimba]] ([[Tezuka Productions]]) and Nippon Animation series distributed by Cloverway, were formerly dubbed and licensed by other companies, so Cloverway just distributed and offered them for reruns or inside TV programming packages.

Parallel in the United States, Cloverway tried to distribute the same series by himself as in Latin America, but due to the regulations that led to the [[Editing of anime in distribution|series censorship]], they delegated licenses to local distributors who managed the production of English [[Language localisation|localisation]], [[Dub localization|dubbing]] and distribution. However, ''[[Sailor Moon S]]'' and ''[[Sailor Moon SuperS]]'' were the only two licenses whose English versions were produced by Cloverway, dubbed in association with Optimum Production Services in Canada. As for the U.S. Hispanic market, Cloverway syndicated the series [[Tenchi Universe]] to [[Univision]] (Univision&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20011102065459/http://cybertoon.tripod.com:80/resource/tenchimuyo.html Spanish TV Saturday mornings on Univision&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Telefutura]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Toonturama]], a three-hour lineup that mainly consisted of dubbed versions of American and European animated series natively produced in English as well as anime series (Lost Universe, Tenchi Universe and Red Baron);&lt;/ref&gt; networks) and [[Dragon Ball Z]] to [[Telemundo]]&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180806114248/https://www.toonzone.net/forums/threads/spanish-dbz-returns.3611071/&lt;/ref&gt; networks.

When [[Shueisha]] became a joint owner of [[Viz Communications]] in 2002 and with the subsequent merger with [[ShoPro]] in 2005&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20051028044910/http://www.viz.com:80/news/newsroom/2005/04_vizmedia.php VIZ, LLC and ShoPro Entertainment, Inc., announced the completion of their merger to form VIZ Media, LLC&lt;/ref&gt;, Cloverway eventually lost the representation of Shueisha (for [[North America|N.A.]] and [[Latin America|L.A.]]) and [[Shogakukan]]&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20171111094029/http://www.ivreality.com.ar/preguntas/comment-page-1/ Ranma 1/2 stand-byes after the change in agent of Shogakukan that went from Cloverway to Viz Media (in the middle of a huge paperwork congestion, while they kept us waiting an infinite amount of time until they solved they intern problems.)&lt;/ref&gt; (for [[Latin America|L.A.]]) for publishing licensing in the [[Americas]].

The company's representation of [[Toei Animation]] in America ceased, due to Toei's decision to start licensing and distributing directly since 2004, thus ending the contracts with their agents [[Tokyo Business Consultants]]&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180805234252/http://poep.nu/2008/film/news/french-court-orders-toei-to-pay-up-1117981235/ TBC sued Toei because it was dissatisfied with Toei’s terms for ending their business partnership.&lt;/ref&gt; in Europe and Cloverway in America, and launching their own offices in 2004 ({{URL|http://www.toei-animation.com|Toei Animation Europe}}&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20101128225056/http://toei-animation.com/fr/societe/toei_animation_europe/activite Toei Animation Europe office was establised in Paris at the end of year 2004 to represent Toei Animation in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20081119141318/http://www.toei-animation.com/fr/societe/toei_animation_europe/historique Décembre 2004 : Création du bureau Toei Animation Europe S.A.S.&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Paris]] and [[Toei Animation Inc.]] based in [[Los Angeles]]). In 2005, the Toei Animation licenses arranged by Cloverway were transferred to Toei Animation Inc. as a requirement, leaving Cloverway only with the catalog of the other Japanese producers they licensed. As a consequence of this, there has been a chain of irregularities, such as the loss of [[Master recordings|master tapes]] of many series formerly distributed by Cloverway, with the Latin American versions being the most affected for this change in distribution.

After losing Toei's successful catalog, Cloverway continued representing and distributing anime from other Japanese companies, adding new properties and selling most of their new catalog to Cartoon Network L.A. and other local TV stations in [[Brazil]] and [[Hispanic America]]. At the middle of 2006 Cloverway licensed an Anime [[Terrestrial television|Free-TV]] [[Block programming|programming block]] titled "Otacraze"&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20101226132105/https://www.papodebudega.com/2006/09/anima-info-122-special-especial.html “For Open TV in Brazil you will have Ranma 1/2, Samurai Champloo, Trigun, Gungrave, Love Hina and Heat Guy J by the end of this year(2006)”&lt;/ref&gt; to Brazilian broadcaster [[:pt:Play TV|Play TV]]&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20090416050102/https://www.papodebudega.com/2007/01/anima-info-205.html Cloverway General Manager Daniel Catañeda said that “we are negotiating OTACRAZE for all of Latin America, but Brazil will be the country where it will premier”&lt;/ref&gt; who begun airing the block in March 2007, including the series [[Ranma 1/2]], [[Samurai Champloo]], [[Trigun]], and [[Love Hina]].

Due to economic problems, Cloverway closed its operations in August 2007.

The '''Comic and Fantasy Art Amateur Press Association''' ('''CFA-APA''') was founded in 1985 by Roger Hill. Its membership consists of knowledgeable fans, creators, and collectors of comic and [[fantasy art]] who write about various subjects related to those genres. The group self-publishes approximately three times a year and each issue has a theme relating to a specific creator or subject. Currently, membership is limited to 40 persons at any one time and circulation is limited to 55 issues, making the publication itself highly collectible.

The CFA-APA began as an informal forum for original comic art collectors to exchange ideas, experiences and information. It provides serious fans and collectors of comic and fantasy art with a forum/publication for discussion of topics, ideas or opinions relative to the original art marketplace. It is designed for those people who have a genuine interest and love for all 
types of art collecting: [[comic book art]], illustrations of [[science fiction art|science fiction]], fantasy, horror or adventure stories, [[Good girl art|pin-up/good-girl art]], cover art from paperbacks, hardcover books, magazines or [[Pulp magazine|pulps]], [[newspaper strips]] or cartoon art, animation art, [[movie posters]] or [[advertising artwork]], and related illustrations or sketches.

Roger Hill is one of the most active comic art collectors, researchers and comic art historians in the United States. He was a comic art consultant to the Sothebys Comic Book and Art auctions held in New York City during the 1990s. He was a contributing writer and Art Editor for the book, ''Against the Grain: Mad Artist Wallace Wood'' &lt;ref&gt;''Against the Grain: Mad Artist Wallace Wood'' (TwoMorrows Publishing 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and a writer and editor for the book ''Frank R. Paul: The Dean of Science Fiction Illustration''.&lt;ref&gt;''Frank R. Paul: The Dean of Science Fiction Illustration'' (IDW Publishing 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these publications were monographs regarding the life and artwork of each of these two artists.  Roger was one of the founding contributors to the '''Squa Tront''' EC fanzine along with Jerry Weist.  Roger's interest in original art lead to the formation of the CFA-APA, after being inspired by the Edgar Rice Burroughs Amateur Press Association (ERBapa).  The ERBapa had previously been founded by John Guidry.

==History==

A history of the CFA-APA was a chapter in  ''The Comic Art Price Guide'' by Jerry Weist.&lt;ref&gt;''The Comic Art Price Guide'' by Jerry Weist (Ivy Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  It was written by CFA-APA Founder, Roger Hill and is found on pages 29–33 of that book.  Roger was a contributing advisor to all three editions of ''The Comic Art Price Guide'' by Jerry Weist.

Roger Hill served as editor of the CFA-APA, initially from Mailing #1 (June 30, 1985) to mailing #15.  The membership initially included 17 members, four of whom were delinquent in sending in contributions to the first mailing.  Wallace Harrington was the editor for Mailings #16-30, 33-34.  Roger Hill edited Mailings #31, #32 and #53-60.  Bob Koppany ''et al'' (see individual listings) edited from Mailings #35-49. Bill Leach edited from Mailings #50-52. Benno Rothschild ''et al'' (see individual listings) edited Mailings #61-89.  Wallace Harrington is scheduled to resume editorial duties again with Mailing #91.

Included among the other members of the group who have written articles or books to add to the history of comics are Tom Roberts (''Alex Raymond: His Life and Art''),&lt;ref&gt;Tom Roberts (''Alex Raymond: His Life and Art'' Adventure House, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Amash (''Matt Baker: The Art of Glamour,'' ''Carmine Infantino: Penciler, Publisher, Provocateur,'' &lt;ref&gt;''Carmine Infantino: Penciler, Publisher, Provocateur'' TwoMorrows Publishing, 2010 with Eric Nolen-Weathington&lt;/ref&gt;), Dewey Cassell (''The Art of George Tuska'',&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Dewey, with Aaron Sultan and Mike Gartland (2005).

==Magazine contents==

The magazine consists of articles written, laid out, and duplicated by its members that are sent to an editor/collator for distribution. Each issue is dedicated to specific articles or general themes. Each issue is dedicated to a specific artist or general theme.

Some of the featured artists themselves write guest contributions. Occasionally, the CFA-APA has a give-away in an issue, giving away a free piece of artwork to a member rendered by the featured artist, or related to the feature artist.

==Membership==

The annual dues are $30.00 for one year (3 issues) to members in the United States, $35.00 to members in Canada, and $45.00 outside the United States or Canada. These fees are used to cover the costs of binding, packaging and mailing the CFA-APA. All issues are sent through first class mail. Membership is limited to 35 people at any one time. Vacancies in the membership roll are filled from a waiting list on a first-come, first-served basis.

Each member must contribute at least two pages or original typed text material for each mailing. They can talk about comments from the prior issue, the artist being featured, comic art auctions or anything related to original art in general. It turns out to be only two pages submitted every four months to remain a CFA-APA member (most members typically contribute more). Should a member miss an issue, they must contribute four pages of text to the following issue. If they fail to do so, they forfeit their active membership and go to the end of the waiting list for new members if they like.

If a member is suspected of fraudulent art dealings, they are asked to temporarily relinquish their membership until they are cleared of the charges or until restitution to the parties has been made.

Each of the members must submit 50 copies (double sided pages) of their contribution to the editor, who assembles the issues, provides a color cover (whenever possible), cerlox binds the issues, and sends them to the members. Although there are potentially 35 members, the non-member copies go to potential new members, and to interested parties on a first-come first-served basis.

'''Deadpool''' ('''Wade Winston Wilson''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist/writer [[Rob Liefeld]], the character first appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'' #98 ([[cover-date]]d February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as a [[supervillain]] when he made his first appearance in ''The New Mutants'' and later in issues of ''X-Force'', but later evolved into his more recognizable [[antiheroic]] persona. Deadpool, whose real name is Wade Wilson, is a disfigured [[mercenary]] with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. The character is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because of his tendency to talk and joke constantly, including his proclivity for breaking the [[fourth wall]], a literary device used by the writers for humorous effect and running gags.

The character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media.

Upon seeing the costume and noting his characteristics (killer with super agility), Nicieza contacted Liefeld, saying "this is [[Deathstroke]] from Teen Titans". Nicieza gave Deadpool the real name of "Wade Wilson" as an inside-joke to being "related" to "Slade Wilson", Deathstroke.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Classic Marvel Figurine Collection" #56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other inspirations were [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Liefeld states: "Wolverine and Spider-Man were the two properties I was competing with at all times. I didn't have those, I didn't have access to those. I had to make my own Spider-Man and Wolverine. That's what [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and Deadpool were meant to be, my own Spider-Man and my own Wolverine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2016/02/12/interview-rob-liefeld-talks-deadpool-comics-cable-and-more/3/#18cf32d4c3ac|title=Interview: Rob Liefeld Talks 'Deadpool', Comics, Cable, and More|first=Mark|last=Hughes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Deadpool and Cable were also meant to be tied into Wolverine's history already from the start, as Liefeld describes: "Wolverine was my guy. If I could tie anything into Wolverine, I was winning." Liefeld's favorite comic title before ''[[X-Men]]'' was ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', which featured weapons like [[Captain America's shield]], [[Mjolnir (comics)|Thor's hammer]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]'s bow and arrow, he decided to give weapons to his new characters as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/02/deadpool-creator-rob-liefeld|title=The Mouth Behind the Merc|website=Complex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first appearance, Deadpool is hired by [[Genesis (Marvel Comics)|Tolliver]] to attack Cable and the [[New Mutants]]. After subsequently appearing in ''[[X-Force]]'' as a recurring character, Deadpool began making guest appearances in a number of different Marvel Comics titles such as ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'', and ''[[Heroes for Hire]]''. In 1993, the character received his own [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]], titled ''The Circle Chase'', written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and pencilled by [[Joe Madureira]]. It was a relative success and Deadpool starred in a second, self-titled miniseries written in 1994 by [[Mark Waid]], pencilled by [[Ian Churchill]], and inked by [[Jason Temujin Minor]] and Bud LaRosa. Waid later commented, "Frankly, if I'd known Deadpool was such a creep when I agreed to write the mini-series, I wouldn't have done it. Someone who hasn't paid for their crimes presents a problem for me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Shutt | first= Craig | date = August 1997 | title = Bad is Good | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | page = 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Deadpool was given his own ongoing title, initially written by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], with then-newcomer [[Ed McGuinness]] as an artist. ''Deadpool'' became an action comedy parody of the cosmic drama, antihero-heavy comics of the time. The series firmly established his supporting cast, including his prisoner/den mother [[Blind Al]] and his best friend [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]]. The ongoing series gained [[cult following|cult popularity]] for its unorthodox main character and its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain, though the element of his moral ambiguity remained. The writer Joe Kelly noted, "With Deadpool, we could do anything we wanted because everybody just expected the book to be cancelled every five seconds, so nobody was paying attention. And we could get away with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090716-JoeKellyDeadpool.html|title=2 Great Tastes That Taste Great Together: Joe Kelly/Deadpool|last= Rogers|first=Vaneta|date=2009-07-16|publisher=Newsarama.com|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly Kelly introduced the [[fourth wall]] breaking gimmick.&lt;ref name=acrithit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acriticalhit.com/you-dont-know-merc-a-history-of-deadpool/|title=You don't know merc: a history of Deadpool|author=Kate Willaert|publisher=A Critical Hit|website=acriticalhit.com|date=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was taken over by [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] who noted that he found Kelly's issues to be "complex and a little hostile to new readers like me" and that by issue 37, he realized that "it was okay to make Deadpool look stupid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-priest.com/comics/deadpool.htm|title=adventures in the funnybook game – Deadpool|last=Priest|first=Christopher |date=September 2000|publisher=Christopher Priest official site|accessdate=August 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly may have introduced Deadpool to breaking the fourth wall, but Priest "could be credited for establishing it as an essential part of the character's personality and worldview." Priest left the series after only one year at issue #45.&lt;ref name=acrithit/&gt;

===2000s===
For a time, writers who followed generally ignored the fourth wall entirely, until [[Gail Simone]] took over with issue #65. Her version is remembered for the frequent use of the "little yellow boxes."&lt;ref name=acrithit/&gt; ''Deadpool'' lasted until issue #69, at which point it was relaunched as a new title with a similar character called ''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]'' in 2002. This occurred during a line-wide revamp of X-Men related comics, with ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'' becoming ''[[Cable (comics)#New Mutants and X-Force|Soldier X]]'' and ''[[X-Force]]'' becoming ''[[X-Statix]]''. Simone notes that "When I took the Deadpool job, the revamp hadn't been planned, so it was a complete surprise. Thankfully, we heard about it in time to make adjustments to the early scripts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/ambi/104611396520415.htm|title=The Gail Simone Dialogues|last=Thomas|first=Brandon|publisher=Silver Bullet Comics|accessdate=August 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827112755/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/ambi/104611396520415.htm|archivedate=August 27, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared that Deadpool was killed in an explosion fighting the supervillain [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]]. Deadpool's manager, [[Sandi Brandenberg]] later founded Agency X with a mysterious man called Alex Hayden, who took the name dubbed [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]. Deadpool later returned to the series. Simone left the title after seven issues due to creative differences with the series editor, but then returned to conclude with issues 13–15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://wordballoon.blogspot.com/2008_10_01_archive.html|title=Gail Simone Has All the Answers |work=Word Balloon with John Siuntres|date=October 30, 2008|accessdate=August 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2016}}

Deadpool's next starring appearance came in 2004 with the launch of ''[[Cable &amp; Deadpool]]'' written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], where Deadpool became partnered with his former enemy, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], teaming up in various adventures. This title was canceled with issue #50 and replaced by a new ''[[Cable (comics)#2008 ongoing|Cable]]'' series in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/xmen/disassembled/X-Who.html BALTIMORE '07 – MARVEL REVEALS X-WHO???

A new ''Deadpool'' [[ongoing series]] written by Daniel Way with artist Paco Medina began as a ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' tie-in. In the first arc, the character is seen working with Nick Fury to steal data on how to kill the [[Skrull]] queen [[Veranke]].&lt;ref name="NEWDeadpool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.3253.NYCC_~apos~08~colon~_Deadpool_Goes_Solo |title=NYCC '08: Deadpool Goes Solo |accessdate=May 4, 2008 |format=news |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SeptRelease"&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = Daniel Way | Artist = Steve Dillon | Story = The Deep End | Title = [[Wolverine: Origins]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 25 | date = May 2008 | Publisher = Marvel | Page = 24 | Panel = 1 | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] steals the information that Deadpool had stolen from the Skrulls, and subsequent stories deal with the fallout from that. Writer [[Daniel Way]] explained, "the first thing Osborn does to try and take care of the situation is to bring in a hired gun to take Deadpool down, which would be Tiger-Shark. That would be the standard thing to do, but of course everything about Deadpool is non-standard. So it goes completely awry and Norman has to get more serious about things." The story also sees the return of [[Bob, Agent of HYDRA]]; "I don't want the book to become 'Deadpool and Friends' so characters will drift in and out, but Bob was someone I definitely wanted to bring in. It just had to be at the perfect moment and when I was putting this storyline together that moment presented itself." This all led directly to a confrontation with the new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] in "Magnum Opus" which crossed over between ''Deadpool'' vol. 2 #8–9 and ''Thunderbolts'' #130–131.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Dave (December 16, 2008).[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=19197 "Way Talks Deadpool &amp; Thunderbolts, Bob"].

A third Deadpool ongoing series, ''Deadpool Team-Up'', launched in November 2009 (with issue numbers counting in reverse starting with issue #899), written by [[Fred Van Lente]], with art by Dalibor Talajic.

===2010s===
Another Deadpool series by Gischler titled ''Deadpool Corps'' was released in April 2010. Besides Deadpool himself, this series featured alternate versions of Deadpool, including Lady Deadpool (who debuted in ''Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth'' #7), [[#Marvel Zombies|Headpool]] (the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' universe incarnation, now reduced to a severed head), and two new characters; Kidpool, a child, and Dogpool, a dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=25629 |title=Gischler Throws an Intergalactic (Dead)pool Party |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=April 8, 2010 |accessdate=May 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series lasted twelve issues.

Deadpool (vol. 2) was written by [[Daniel Way]] and drawn by [[Alé Garza]]. In the story arc "DEAD", Wade is "cured" of his healing ability and becomes mortal. As a side effect, he also has his old, unscarred face once again. Although he spent the majority of the story arc looking forward to dying, he suppresses his desires in order to protect his friend and [[sidekick]] [[Bob, Agent of Hydra|Hydra Bob]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

After he loses his healing factor, Wilson claims he felt "more alive than ever."{{issue|date=December 2012}} However, after a harsh beating from Intelligencia, Wade realized that he had let his ability to heal compensate for skill so he decided to ask for help from [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] in training.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Taskmaster asked Wilson to help him steal Pym Particles from S.H.I.E.L.D., but actually, he allowed Black Box to study Wade in order to prepare his vengeance against Wilson, even letting him know Deadpool lost his healing factor.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Wade managed to defeat Black Box, Black Tom and Black Swan, but in the process, his face was burned and disfigured again.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Former FBI agent Allison Kemp wanted to get revenge on Deadpool because of his involvement in an accident which left her in a wheelchair, and she called other enemies of Deadpool such as T-Ray and [[Slayback]] and trained them to kill Deadpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Daniel Way|penciller = Ale Garza|inker = Sean Parsons|colorist = Guru eFX|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D.

Initially a secret, his bride was revealed in the webcomic ''Deadpool: The Gauntlet'' to be [[Shiklah|Shiklah, Queen of the Undead]]. Deadpool also discovers that he has a daughter by the name of Eleanor from a former flame of Deadpool named Carmelita.&lt;ref name="Deadpool #19"&gt;''Deadpool'' #19. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later, he clashed with [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], believing the universe was telling to defeat him. After several fights and getting torn to pieces, Deadpool bonds with four symbiotes: Riot, Phage, Lasher and Agony. Playing mind games, Deadpool tricked [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]] by using his shapeshifting abilities to make her disorient and having her flee. After the symbiotic Deadpool and Carnage fought again, Deadpool captures Shriek and forces her to impersonate himself, making it trick Carnage into almost killing her in the process. Feeling broken after a mental breakdown, Carnage allowed himself to be arrested and was placed in an unlocked cell. While sitting in the cell until he was his own self, Carnage swore vengeance on Deadpool. Deadpool, after defeating Carnage, gives the four symbiotes to a war dog who helped Deadpool fight Carnage to deliver to them to the government.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' Vol. 1 #1-4. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deadpool's death occurs in ''Deadpool'' #250, involving story ideas that cowriters Gerry Duggan and Brian Posehn have had in mind since the beginning of the NOW series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ign.com/articles/2015/01/09/marvel-reveals-deadpool-will-die-in-april-2015 Marvel reveals Deadpool will die in April 2015].

He, along with his family and friends, (''and presumably everyone on Earth'') are all killed when the Earth [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|collides with an alternate universe's Earth]]. Deadpool laments that the Secret Wars should have stayed an Avengers event, but then dies at peace, content that everybody else is dying with him.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' (2012) #45. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

====All New, All Different Marvel====
Eight months after the events of ''Secret Wars'' and the restoration of Earth, Deadpool is seen working for [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]]. After stealing some potentially life-saving chemicals needed by an ailing [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], he is offered membership in the [[Avengers Unity Squad]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #0&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the following months, Deadpool's popularity skyrocketed after the mercenary Solo impersonated him to piggyback on Deadpool's reputation and take jobs at a higher pay rate. One of Solo's jobs in Washington, D.C. had Deadpool's public opinion drastically change for the better when he saved an ambassador from his telepathically-manipulated agents. After learning of Solo's impersonation, Deadpool came up with the idea to form a group of mercenaries called the Mercs for Money to extend his reach across the globe. However, Deadpool's newfound popularity forced him to leave his family behind, fearing his enemies could endanger them. Deadpool additionally joined the Avengers Unity Division and used his popularity as a means of funding the team, with the profit from merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' vol. 4, #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Madcap additionally returned to Deadpool's life, though Wade was unaware his experience inside his mind left Madcap emotionally damaged and vengeful. Madcap initially posed as an ally, joining the Mercs for Money, but eventually showed his true intentions after he was discovered impersonating Deadpool to defame and threaten his loved onces. Seeing as he had had enough fun, Madcap used an alien weapon to molecularly disintegrate himself. For his second coming, the villain had Deadpool unwittingly become the carrier of a deadly airborne virus with which he infected his family. Wade found a cure, though had to resort to Cable's evil clone Stryfe to find it. Around this time, tensions between Shiklah's domain and the surface word sparked an invasion of Manhattan from Monster Metropolis, which in turn led to Shiklah divorcing Deadpool, opting to return to Dracula instead.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' Vol 4 #23-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after Wade joined the Avengers Unity Division, the real Steve Rogers was secretly supplanted by an evil fascist counterpart from another timeline that operated as a Hydra sleeper agent within the superhero community. When Phil Coulson became suspicious of Steve, Rogers convinced Deadpool to kill him, claiming that Coulson had gone rogue. A short time afterwards, Captain America's machinations resulted in Hydra rising to power, taking over the United States of America. When Hydra's conquest had barely begun, Preston found out about Coulson's death, and confronted Deadpool about it. The fight ended in Preston's death. As Hydra's empire grew stronger, Wade joined its own version of the Avengers out of blind loyalty for Captain America. Plagued by guilt, Wade held back when tasked with hunting down the rebel alliance known as the Underground, and eventually helped, behind the scenes, to lay part of the foundation of Hydra's eventual defeat. With his mistakes costing the lives of two of his friends, the love of his daughter, and any respect the world had for him, Deadpool turned his back on what little remained of the life he had built.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' Vol 4 #31-36&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marvel Legacy and Fresh Start====
As many heroes and villains alike are now hunting for Deadpool's head, Deadpool must accomplish his atonement he can still recover, such as humiliating Hydra Supreme Rogers in his prison, and asking the now returned real Captain America to revive Preston. Once his atonements were done, Deadpool began to erase every good memory that he unintentionally made worse, restarted his new life and had his criminal records aligned with Hydra made clear. Although Deadpool erased his memories, the real Captain America managed to recover the photo of him, Deadpool and Wolverine from Deadpool's pocket, the only good piece left which Deadpool will be able to remember.&lt;ref&gt;''Despicable Deadpool'' (2018). Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
{{expand section|date=May 2017}}
The character's back-story has been presented as vague and subject to change, and within the narrative he is unable to remember his personal history due to a mental condition. Whether or not his name was even Wade Wilson is subject to speculation since one of his nemeses, [[T-Ray (comics)|T-Ray]], claims in ''Deadpool'' #33 that he is the real Wade Wilson and that Deadpool is a vicious murderer who stole his identity.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' Vol. 3 #23.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been other dubious stories about his history—at one point the supervillain [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] claimed to be his father.&lt;ref name="Deadpool #36"&gt;''Deadpool'' (2012) #36.&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, revelations are later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] or ignored altogether, and in one issue, Deadpool himself joked that whether or not he is actually Wade Wilson depends on which writer the reader prefers.&lt;ref&gt;"Cable and Deadpool" #47.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has professed to be Canadian.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel NOW Deadpool'' #3.&lt;/ref&gt; The original story had him joining the [[Weapon X]] program after being kicked out of the U.S. Army Special Forces and given an artificial healing factor based on Wolverine's thanks to Dr. [[Emrys Killebrew]], one of the head scientists.&lt;ref&gt;''Cable and Deadpool'' #39.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commonly breaks the [[fourth wall]], which is done by few other characters in the [[Marvel Universe]], and this is used to humorous effect. He often has conversations with his two internal monologues, which are shown as caption boxes in his panels; in ''Deadpool Annual'' #1 (2014) it is revealed that [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]], a foe of [[Captain America]], is the psychotic voice appearing in white captions with a typewriter serif;&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool Annual'' #1 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; the other voice is unidentified and often mistakenly attributed to Dr. Bong, Deadpool's former psychiatrist.

Deadpool is depicted as having a regenerative healing factor, which not only prevents him from being permanently injured through enhanced cell regeneration throughout his body, but also causes psychosis and mental instability, as his [[neuron]]s are also affected by the accelerated regeneration. It is thought that while his psychosis is a handicap, it is also one of his assets as they make him an extremely unpredictable opponent. [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], who has photo-reflexive memory which allows him to copy anyone's fighting skills by observation, was unable to defeat Deadpool due to his chaotic and improvised fighting style.&lt;ref name="DeadpoolV1Issue02"&gt;{{Cite comic

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taskmaster has also stated that Deadpool is an expert at distracting his opponents.&lt;ref name="DeadpoolV1Issue02" /&gt;

The character, known for his talkative nature, has been nicknamed the "Merc with a Mouth".&lt;ref name=filmjournal&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.filmjournal.com/features/deadpool-marvel-simon-kinberg-producer-interview| title=Everyone into the Deadpool: Producer Simon Kinberg helps revive Marvel's raunchy superhero| first= Frank |last=Lovece|authorlink=Frank Lovece|date= January 26, 2016 | work= [[Film Journal International]] | archivedate = January 28, 2016| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160128182927/http://www.filmjournal.com/features/deadpool-marvel-simon-kinberg-producer-interview |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deadpool has sometimes been portrayed to have a strong sense of core morality. In ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'', he storms out after [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] tries to rationalize [[Fantomex]] killing [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], who was at the time in a child form. After Wolverine argues that Deadpool is motivated solely by money, [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] reveals that Deadpool never cashed any of his checks.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' #5 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual orientation===
In December 2013, Deadpool was confirmed as being [[pansexual]] by ''Deadpool'' writer Gerry Duggan via Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=408076514568065024|user=GerryDuggan|title=@JD_Boucher tell the kids I have a...|accessdate=September 6, 2015|date=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about Deadpool's sexuality, co-creator Fabian Nicieza stated, "Deadpool is whatever sexual inclination his brain tells him he is in THAT moment. And then the moment passes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|number=631482629494149121|user=FabianNicieza|title=Deadpool is whatever sexual...|accessdate= September 6, 2015|date=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicieza has also stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not trying to be dismissive, but readers always want to 'make a character their own' and often that is to the exclusion of what the character might mean to other fans. I've been dogged with the DP sexuality questions for YEARS. It is a bit tiring. He is NO sex and ALL sexes. He is yours and everyone else's. So not dismissive, but rather the epitome of inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Deadpool Co-Creator Weighs in on Character's Sexuality - Comic Book Resources|url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/deadpool-co-creator-weighs-in-on-characters-sexuality|website = www.comicbookresources.com|accessdate = September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Powers and abilities===
Deadpool's primary power is an accelerated healing factor, depicted by various writers at differing levels of efficiency. The speed of his healing factor depends on the severity of the wound and Deadpool's mental state. It works most efficiently when he is awake, alert, and in good spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=By Daniel Way:The Complete Collection By Daniel Way: Volume One|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deadpool's accelerated healing factor is strong enough that he has survived complete incineration and decapitation more than once.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Although his head normally has to be reunited with his body to heal a decapitation wound,&lt;ref&gt;''Cable &amp; Deadpool'' #44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool Team-Up'' #898.&lt;/ref&gt; he was able to regrow his head after having it pulverized by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] in the graphic novel ''Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe''.{{issue|date=December 2015}}

Deadpool's brain cells are similarly affected, with dying [[neuron]]s being rejuvenated at a super accelerated rate. This allows Deadpool to recover from any head wounds, and it renders him nearly invulnerable to psychic and telepathic powers,&lt;ref&gt;''Cable &amp; Deadpool'' #8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' #69.&lt;/ref&gt; although this ability is inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;''Cable &amp; Deadpool: Enemy of the State''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Agent X'' # 14.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been revealed that at the time his healing ability was given to him, Deadpool suffered from some form of cancer; after the healing factor was given to him, it made his normal cells as well as his cancerous cells unable to die, giving him a heavily scarred appearance beneath his suit.{{issue|date=April 2015}}

Deadpool's body is highly resistant to most drugs and toxins, due to his accelerated healing factor. For example, it is extremely difficult for him to become intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' #12.&lt;/ref&gt; He can be affected by certain drugs, such as tranquilizers if he is exposed to a large enough dosage.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Unlike Wolverine, whose wounds sometimes cause excruciating pain as they heal depending on the severity, Deadpool has some degree of pain insensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/103688/does-deadpool-feel-pain|title=11 Does Deadpool feel pain ?|date=2015-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deadpool is effectively [[immortality|immortal]], although he has died several times.&lt;ref name="Deadpool #61"&gt;''Deadpool'' #61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deadpool &amp; Death Annual.&lt;/ref&gt; He is still alive 800 years in the future when the new X-Force encounters him.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force / Cable Messiah War'' Oneshot.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Thanos]] once declared that Deadpool should "consider yourself cursed{{nbsp}}... with life!" out of jealousy over Deadpool's status as [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]'s love interest.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' Vol. 1 #64.&lt;/ref&gt; His enemy T-Ray later resurrected him,&lt;ref name="Deadpool #61"/&gt; under Thanos' instruction, using an artifact he had given him.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' #64.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Deadpool was informed that Thanos had placed a curse on him, and tracked Thanos down. He revealed that the only thing keeping Wade alive was his "spell of darkest necromancy". Although Thanos removed this curse in order to kill Deadpool, he felt forced to immediately bring him back using "a fusion of necromancy and science" in order to request his aid in tracking down [[Mistress Death]], who had gone missing.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool vs Thanos'' #1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deadpool is a highly trained [[assassination|assassin]] and [[mercenary]], adept in multiple forms of [[martial art]]s, an extraordinary athlete, and an expert swordsman and marksman. His accelerated healing factor may contribute to his abilities, allowing him to perform intense exercise for extended periods of time with minimal aches and fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Deadpool: The Complete Collection By Daniel Way: Volume One|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in earlier years he was originally portrayed as having superhuman strength, he is no longer depicted as having this ability.&lt;ref&gt;''Cable &amp; Deadpool'' #36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Deadpool has owned a number of personal teleportation devices. Also, during Deadpool's first ongoing comic, he possesses a device which projected holographic disguises, allowing him to go undercover or conceal his appearance. Deadpool is [[multilingual]], with the ability to speak fluently in German, Spanish, [[American Sign Language|ASL]], and Japanese, in addition to his native English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.superherodb.com/deadpool/10-835/powers/|title=Deadpool|website=www.superherodb.com|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Deadpool is aware that he is a fictional character,&lt;ref name="DeadpoolV1Issue34" /&gt; he uses this knowledge to his advantage to deal with opponents or gain knowledge to which he should not normally have access, such as reading past issues of his and others' comics.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool Team-Up'' #885.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Deadpool knows he has a Wikipedia article and hopes his fans keep his page updated.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' vol, 3, #36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
{{Main|Alternative versions of Deadpool}}
As a fictional character, Deadpool has appeared in various adaptations, from comic books to films and television series. Each version of the work typically establishes its own continuity, and sometimes introduces parallel universes, to the point where distinct differences in the portrayal of the character can be identified. This article details various versions of Deadpool depicted in works including Marvel Comics' [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate universe]] and ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' issues.

* Following the events of ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', which reset the ''X-Men'' film series timeline, Ryan Reynolds reprised his role in ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'', which premiered in February 2016.

Ajax tortures Wade in order to catalyse the treatment, which eventually results in regressive mutant genes activating, causing his disfigurement and healing factor. Wade goes on a vendetta to force Ajax to fix his disfigurement, and eventually kills him on Ajax's admission that this was impossible. This film also introduces to Reynolds's incarnation his most famous weakness from the comics: his [[Truman Syndrome]] that adds to the comedic effect by giving him the ability to reference not just X-Men movies and casts, but also Ryan Reynolds and his filmography. 
** Before screenings of the film ''[[Logan (2017 film)|Logan]]'' in U.S. territories a pre-film sequence, that was later titled ''[[Deadpool: No Good Deed]]'' and released online, was shown serving as a teaser of sorts for ''Deadpool 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/logan-deadpool-2-teaser-2017-3|title=There's a secret teaser for 'Deadpool 2' in front of 'Logan' screenings|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rhett Reese]], the writer, confirmed that the film was a short and "not a teaser or a trailer".{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The plot of the short revolves around Deadpool attempting to change into his costume in a phone booth fast enough to stop a nearby mugging. The man is shot before Deadpool can finish putting on his costume. Deadpool apologizes as he could have just called the police since he was already inside a phone booth. He then lies down and initiates a one-sided conversation with the dead man.
** ''[[Deadpool 2]]'', announced to be in development shortly after the first film's release, is directed by [[David Leitch (director)|David Leitch]] and premiered in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/deadpool-sequel-works-863418 |title='Deadpool' Sequel Already in the Works |last=Kit |first=Borys |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=February 9, 2016 |accessdate=October 28, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lbd7w4SP?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/deadpool-sequel-works-863418 |archivedate=October 28, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/foxs-x-men-issues-jennifer-lawrence-unsigned-deadpool-defections-gambit-hold-945505|title=-Fox's X-Men Issues: Jennifer Lawrence Unsigned, 'Deadpool' Defections, 'Gambit' on Hold|work=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Kit|first=Borys|date=November 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of his girlfriend Vanessa, Deadpool ended up in the series of events to protect an angst boy named Russell Collins ([[Julian Dennison]]) from [[Cable (comics)|Nathan Summers / Cable]] ([[Josh Brolin]]). Reynolds also plays himself and reprises the Weapon XI version of Wade from ''X-Men Origins'', both killed by Deadpool in the mid-credits.

On 10 [[thermidor]] year 15 (29 July 1807), [[Napoleon I of France]] signed a '''decree reducing the number of theatres''' in [[Paris]] to eight, giving the force of law to a decree of the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|interior minister]] of 25 April that same year.  This measure cut short an expansion in theatres.

Following is a list of the theatres that remained.

'''''Grands théâtres'''''
* [[Comédie-Française|Théâtre Français]] (Théâtre de S.M. l'Empereur), reserved for tragedy and comedy;
* [[Théâtre de l'Odéon|Théâtre de l'Impératrice]], as an annex of the Théâtre Français;
* [[Opéra national de Paris|Théâtre de l'Opéra]] (Académie impériale de Musique), for song and dance;
* [[Théâtre national de l'Opéra-Comique|Théâtre de l'Opéra-Comique]], for ''comédies ou drames mêlés de couplets, d'ariettes et de morceaux d'ensemble.''

'''''Théâtres secondaires'''''
* [[Théâtre du Vaudeville]], reserved for ''petites pièces mêlées de couplets sur des airs connus'';
* [[Théâtre des Variétés]], for repertoire made up of ''petites pièces dans le genre grivois, [[Genre poissard|poissard]] ou villageois'';
* [[Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin]], for melodrama and spectaculars;
* [[Théâtre de la Gaîté (boulevard du Temple)|Théâtre de la Gaîté]], for ''[[mime|pantomime]]s de tous genres, mais sans [[ballet]]s, aux [[arlequin]]ades et autres [[farce]]s, dans le goût de celles données autrefois par [[Jean-Baptiste Nicolet|Nicolet]].''

The decree did not remain in force after Napoleon's fall in 1814.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

A '''doof''' or '''bush doof''' is a type of outdoor dance party generally held in a remote country area, or outside a large city in surrounding bush or rainforest. Originating in the post-punk electronic music scene of Sydney, Australia, in the early 1990s, events referred to as ''doofs'' are now held worldwide and have built from a small set of social groups to a subculture with millions of active members worldwide, considered by some as a full blown culture &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2072913/Doof_Australian_Post_Rave_Culture._In_Graham_St_John_ed._FreeNRG_Notes_From_the_Edge_of_the_Dance_Floor_Commonground_2001_ Doof! Australian Post Rave Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; similar to [[rave]]s or [[teknival]]s. Doofs generally have healing workshops, speakers, art, live artists and DJs playing a range of electronic music, commonly [[Goa trance|goa]], [[House music|house]], [[dub techno]], [[Techno]], [[Psychedelic music|acid heavy sounds]] and [[psychedelic trance]].

"Doof doof" is an Australian term for loud electronic music centred on a heavy bass drum kick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rural/telegraph/stories/s975732.htm Bush Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rural/reporter/stories/s1901402.htm Doof doof in the bush, ABC]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name is [[onomatopoeic]], and is derived from the sound of the [[kick drum]] used in the [[electronic music]] frequently played at these events (as in "doof doof doof doof music").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/22/1066631486366.html Doof doof doof article, The Age]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Peter Strong&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/mashy_p&lt;/ref&gt;, the original term "doof" was created in Newtown, Sydney in Spring 1992, after a neighbour of the [[Non Bossy Posse]] knocked on the door to complain about their music: "What is this Doof Doof Doof I hear all night long, this is not music" she exclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/dance/music/02doof.htm Four Corners "Beneath the Mirror Ball"]&lt;/ref&gt; The term did not become a popular designation for outdoor dance parties until after the mid-1990s. 

== History ==
During the 1990s free dance parties proliferated in Sydney, particularly in Sydney Park in St Peters and warehouses of the [[Inner West]]. As pressure from police and councils increased, holding parties in the bush appeared as a more viable option.

The first commercial doof party to be hosted within Australia and New Zealand was [[Earthcore]] in 1993. Today the term 'doof' can describe anything from a small gathering in the bush focused around a small sound system to a multi-day, multi-stage event with DJs, bands and workshops. 

In 2013, "bush doof" was added to the [[Macquarie Dictionary#Sixth Edition|sixth edition of the Macquarie Dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inthemix.com.au/news/56574/Rejoice_Bush_doof_is_now_in_the_dictionary Bush Doof officially added to the Macquarie Dictionary, inthemix]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edwin Forrest''' (March 9, 1806 – December 12, 1872) was a prominent nineteenth-century American Shakespearean actor. His feud with the British actor [[William Charles Macready]] was the cause of the deadly [[Astor Place Riot]] of 1849.

==Early life==
Forrest was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], the son of Rebecca (''née'' Lauman) and William Forrest. His father, a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] merchandise peddler, moved from [[Dumfriesshire]] to [[Trenton, New Jersey]] in 1791. His mother was a member of an affluent [[German Americans|German-American]] family. A business setback led William to relocate to Philadelphia, where he married Rebecca and was able to secure a position with a local branch of the [[First Bank of the United States|United States Bank]].&lt;ref name= "Forrest"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w5QXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA381 Rees, James - ''The life of Edwin Forrest: With Reminiscences and Personal Recollections,'' 1874] accessed 12.13.12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Edwin Forrest"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JA4OAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22edwin+forrest%22++barrett&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U6bKUJPPNae7iwKVo4HADw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA Barrett, Lawrence and Forrest, Edwin, ''Edwin Forrest'', 1881] accessed 12.13.12&lt;/ref&gt; As boys, Forrest and his brother William joined a local [[Amateur theatre|juvenile thespian club]] and participated in theatrical performances staged in a sparsely decorated woodshed.

At the age of 11, Forrest made his first appearance on the legitimate stage at Philadelphia's South Street Theatre, playing the female role Rosalia de Borgia in the John D. Turnbull melodrama ''Rudolph: or, The Robbers of Calabria''. After Forrest's father died in 1819, he attempted to apprentice with a printer, a cooper, and finally a ship chandler. When attending a lecture in early 1820, he volunteered to participate in an experiment on the effects of [[nitrous oxide]]. While under the influence of the gas, he broke into a [[soliloquy]] from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Richard III (play)|''Richard III'']] that impressed eminent Philadelphia lawyer John Swift so much that Swift arranged an audition at the [[Walnut Street Theatre]]; this led to Forrest's formal stage debut on November 27, 1820, as Young Norval in [[John Home]]'s [[Douglas (play)|''Douglas'']].&lt;ref name= "Forrest" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Edwin Forrest" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Twentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans: Volume IV Forrest, Edwin 1904 p. 152-153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early acting career==
The theatres of New York and Philadelphia were already crowded with trained and successful actors. Forrest therefore set out at once for the south and west. His tour through a rough country—with the inconveniences of long distances, the necessity of presenting his plays in rude halls, insufficient support, and poor scenery—was not altogether successful, but the discipline to mind and body was felt in all his subsequent career.&lt;ref name="appletons"&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|last=Barrett|first=Lawrence|authorlink=Lawrence Barrett|wstitle=Forrest, Edwin|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forrest soon gained fame for portraying [[blackface]] caricatures of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, May 9, 1897, 'THE OLD TIME MINSTREL: He Has Gone Out of Vogue, but the Public Recollects Him with Pleasure:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The great tragedian Edwin Forrest was very fond of negro minstrelsy, and could give a splendid imitation of the negro dialect, having "blacked up" when he strolling in the West, learning his art.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constance Rourke]] wrote that his impression was so believable he often mingled in the streets with African Americans unnoticed. He allegedly fooled one old black woman into taking him for a friend and then convinced her to join him in his stage performance that night.&lt;ref name="watkins-fooled"&gt;Rourke, Constance (1931). ''American Humor: A Study of the National Character''. Quoted in Watkins 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York success==
[[File:Edwin Forrest 001.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Forrest at 21]]
In 1826 he had a great success at the [[Bowery Theatre]] in New York City as [[Othello]]. The management employed him at a salary far below his worth, and he was at once offered increased payment at another theatre; but he refused to break his word, and carried out the contract to his own detriment. This strict sense of honor was characteristic of him throughout his career.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;

His New York success was repeated in every city he visited. In 1829 he was featured as Metamora in the play ''[[Metamora; or, The Last of the Wampanoags]]'' by [[John Augustus Stone]]. After a few years of profitable labor, during which he had encouraged native talent by liberal offers for new American plays, he went to Europe for rest and travel and larger observation, and was received with much courtesy by actors and scholars.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;

He returned to Philadelphia in 1831, and played there and in New York and elsewhere with triumphant success until September, 1836, when he sailed for England, this time professionally, and made his first appearance at [[Drury Lane]] as Spartacus in ''[[The Gladiator (1831 play)|The Gladiator]]'' in 1836. The play was not a success, although his own role was noted favorably. During a season of ten months he performed in that historic theatre the parts of Macbeth, Othello, and King Lear. His social triumphs were as great as were his professional; he was entertained by [[William Macready]] and [[Charles Kemble]], and at the end of the season was complimented by a dinner at the [[Garrick Club]], presided over by [[Thomas Talfourd]].&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;

During this engagement he married, in June 1837, Miss [[Catherine Norton Sinclair]], daughter of John Sinclair, a popular English singer. He returned to Philadelphia in November of the same year and began an engagement. His wife made a deep impression wherever she was presented, and it was argued that domestic happiness would be the fitting crown of his public career. But these predictions were disappointed.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;

== Playwrighting contest ==
Edwin Forrest began a playwrighting contest from 1828 to 1847. The only rule the plays had to follow was that the lead Character had to fit Forrest and the plays typically followed American themes. The first play to win the contest was ''Metamora'' by John Augustus Stone in 1828. The winner the following year was ''The Gladiator'' by Robert Montgomery Bird. Other winning titles include Richard Penn Smith's ''Caius Marcus''; two other plays by Robert Mongomery Bird: ''Oralloosa'' and ''The Broker of Bogota''; and Robert T. Conrad's ''Jack Cade''. Of these Forrest kept The ''Gladiator, Metamora,'' and ''Jack Cade.'' Forrest is known now as a great Shakespearean actor as well as a supporter of emerging playwrights, as his contest helped get their plays produced.

==Rivalry with Macready==
Forrest visited London a second time in 1845, accompanied by his wife, who was welcomed in the intellectual circles of English and Scottish society. He acted at the [[Princess's Theatre]] in London. He met with great success in Virginius and other parts, but when he attempted to personate [[Macbeth]], a character unsuited to his physique and style of acting, the performance was hissed by the audience. Forrest attributed the hissing to the professional jealousy and machinations of Macready, although that artist had been kind and helpful to him when he first came before London audiences.

A few weeks later, when Macready was playing Hamlet in [[Edinburgh]], Forrest stood up in a private box and hissed the English actor. This act evoked reproaches from the British press and destroyed the respect in which he had been held by the public. A letter by Forrest printed in ''[[The Times]]'' aggravated the offence. The incident was fatal to his popularity in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. His jealousy of Macready resulted in the [[Astor Place riot]] in May 1849.  The public feud had exacerbated rifts in New York City social and political life.  An estimated 10,000 people filled the streets outside the theater where Macready was playing [[Macbeth]], fighting running battles with authorities and vainly trying to set fire to the Astor Opera House.  Dozens of rioters were killed, and around 250 civilians, policemen and soldiers were injured.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;

==Divorce==
[[File:Edwin Forrest daguerreotype c1840-60.png|thumb|right|Early [[daguerreotype]] of Forrest]]
In 1850, Forrest and his wife sought divorce, after Forrest's affair with actress [[Josephine Clifton]]; he claimed that he had found a [[love letter]] to his wife from fellow actor [[George W. Jamieson]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Thomas N. ''Nathaniel Parker Willis and the Trials of Literary Fame''. New York, Oxford University Press, 2001: 116. {{ISBN|0-19-512073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forrest and Catherine separated in April 1849 and he moved to Philadelphia where he filed for divorce in February 1850, though the Pennsylvania legislature denied his divorce application.&lt;ref&gt;Beers, Henry A. ''Nathaniel Parker Willis''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913: 309.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the advice of [[Parke Godwin (journalist)|Parke Godwin]], Catherine hired [[Charles O'Conor (American politician)|Charles O'Conor]] as her lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Thomas N. ''Nathaniel Parker Willis and the Trials of Literary Fame''. New York, Oxford University Press, 2001: 118. {{ISBN|0-19-512073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divorce became a ''[[Cause célèbre]]'' and the well-known writer [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]] was caught in the middle. Willis defended Catherine, who maintained her innocence, in his magazine ''[[Town &amp; Country (magazine)|Home Journal]]'' and suggested that Forrest was merely jealous of her intellectual superiority.&lt;ref&gt;Beers, Henry A. ''Nathaniel Parker Willis''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913.: 311.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 17, 1850, shortly after Forrest had filed for divorce in the New York Supreme Court,&lt;ref&gt;Beers, Henry A. ''Nathaniel Parker Willis''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913: 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Forrest beat Willis with a [[gutta-percha]] [[whip]] in New York's [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square]], shouting "this man is the seducer of my wife".&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Thomas N. ''Nathaniel Parker Willis and the Trials of Literary Fame''. New York, Oxford University Press, 2001: 115. {{ISBN|0-19-512073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willis, who was recovering from a [[rheumatic fever]] at the time, was unable to fight back.&lt;ref name=Beers313&gt;Beers, Henry A. ''Nathaniel Parker Willis''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1913: 313.&lt;/ref&gt; Willis's own wife soon received an anonymous letter suggesting that Willis was, in fact, involved with Forrest's wife.&lt;ref name=Yellin112&gt;Yellin, Jean Fagan. ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Basic Civitas Books, 2004: 112. {{ISBN|0-465-09288-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willis later sued Forrest for assault and, by March 1852, was awarded $2,500 plus court costs.&lt;ref name=Beers313/&gt; In the divorce case, Charles O'Conor was the counsel for Catherine, the defendant, with John Van Buren representing Edwin. Throughout the Forrest divorce case, which lasted six weeks, several witnesses made additional claims that Catherine Forrest and Nathaniel Parker Willis were having an affair, including a waiter who claimed he had seen the couple "lying on each other".&lt;ref name=Yellin112/&gt; As the press reported, "thousands and thousands of the anxious public" awaited the court's verdict; ultimately, the court sided with Catherine Forrest and Willis's name was cleared.&lt;ref&gt;Yellin, Jean Fagan. ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Basic Civitas Books, 2004: 113. {{ISBN|0-465-09288-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Conor won a national reputation by winning the case, and secured a liberal alimony for Catherine.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt; The whole affair hurt Forrest's reputation and soured his temper.

==Later stage career==
In 1853 he played Macbeth, with a strong cast and fine scenery, at the [[Old Broadway Theatre|Broadway Theatre]] for four weeks—an unprecedented run at that date—and at the end of this engagement he retired from the stage for several years. He became interested in politics, being spoken of as a candidate for congress, and did not return to professional life until 1860, when he appeared at [[Niblo's Garden]], New York, as Hamlet, and played the most successful engagement of his life. Hereditary gout developed itself in a malignant form in 1865, during an engagement at the [[Holliday Street Theatre]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] the [[sciatic nerve]] was paralyzed, and he never regained the use of his hand or his steady gait. His California tour in 1866 was a failure. He played his last New York engagement in February, 1871, the plays being ''[[Richelieu (play)|Richelieu]]'' and ''King Lear''.  The weather was cold, and the houses empty.

In October 1871, Forrest commenced his last annual tour, starting at the Walnut Theater in his home town of Philadelphia. He passed through Columbus, OH; Cincinnati OH, New Orleans LA, Galveston TX, Nashville TN, Kansas City, Leavenworth KA, St. LouisMO, Pittsburgh PA. Detroit MI, Buffalo NY and, by late February, the Opera House in Rochester NY, February 27 through March 1. From Rochester he traveled on to Boston MA.&lt;ref&gt;Philadelphia Inquirer 10/16/1871; Portsmouth, Ohio, Daily Times 10/28/1871; Cincinnati Enquirer 11/9/1871; New Orleans Times Democrat 11/24/1871; Galveston Daily News 12/8/1871; Nashville Union and American 12/23/1871; New Orleans Times Democrat, 12/31/1871, Atchinson, Kansas, Daily Champion 12/30/1871; Atlanta Constitution 1/19/1872; Pittsburgh Commercial, 1/29/1872; Detroit Free Press 2/4/1872; Detroit Free Press 2/6/1872; Washington, DC National Republican 2/24/1872; Rochester Democrat &amp; Chronicle 2/26/1872; Detroit Free Press 3/24/1872; Rochester Democrat &amp; Chronicle  4/4/1872, Baltimore Sun 4/6/1872&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of March 25, 1872, he appeared in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] at the [[Globe Theatre, Boston (1871)|Globe Theatre]], as Lear, played this part six times, and was announced for Richelieu and Virginius, but on the intervening Sunday he caught cold. He struggled through the role of Richelieu on Monday night, and rare bursts of eloquence lighted the gloom, but he labored piteously against the disease which was fast conquering him. Being offered stimulants, he signed them away, with the words, "If I die, I will still be my royal self." This was his last appearance as an actor. He eventually recovered from the severe attack of pneumonia. The craving for public applause, which was his only happiness, induced him to give readings from Shakespeare in several large cities. The scheme failed, and was abandoned, to his deep mortification.&lt;ref name="appletons" /&gt;

A stroke of paralysis ended his life suddenly and without pain. His servant found him dead, alone, and apparently asleep, in his home in Philadelphia December 12, 1872. His body was interred in Old Saint Paul's Episcopal Church Cemetery, Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=forrest&amp;GSfn=edwin&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=354&amp;df=all&amp; |title= Edwin Forrest |website= Find a Grave |access-date= 2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large sums that he had earned on the stage were judiciously and fortunately invested, and resulted in his amassing a large fortune. He had purchased, about 1850, a site on the banks of the [[Hudson River|Hudson]], on which he erected a castellated structure. This estate, which he named [[Fonthill Castle and the Administration Building of the College of Mount St. Vincent|Fonthill]], he afterward sold at a large advance for a convent, which later became the [[College of Mount Saint Vincent]]. In 1855 he purchased his mansion in Philadelphia, to which he retired after his temporary abandonment of the stage. There he collected the largest dramatic library in the United States. By avoiding New York and by legal evasions he succeeded in escaping the payment of alimony to his wife, but left his estate heavily in her debt.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;

==Philanthropic efforts==
[[File:Edwin Forrest Mansion.jpg|thumb|right|Edwin Forrest home in Philadelphia]]
His love of the theatre was unbounded, and he is one of the few whose memory survives to this day, for he used his considerable accumulated wealth to support his fellow actors.

This began in 1865, the year of Lincoln's assassination by the actor [[John Wilkes Booth]], a time when the public held those in the acting profession in low regard, if not contempt. He sheltered actors at his Summer home near Philadelphia and, in 1876, four years after his death at the age of 66, his will instructed that there should be formed the Forrest Home for retired actors in Philadelphia, which was to last for over one hundred years before being folded into the much larger [[Actors' Fund|Actors Fund]] facility in [[Englewood, New Jersey]]. There his name lives on, in the Edwin Forrest Wing.

In the 1920s, architect [[Herbert J. Krapp]] was chosen to design two new theatres, one in New York City and the other in Philadelphia. Both were initially named the Forrest Theatre in honor of Forrest and his contributions to the theatre world. While the Philadelphia location is still called the [[Forrest Theatre]], the building in New York has changed names over the years and is currently known as the [[Eugene O'Neill Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shubertorganization.com/theatres/forrest_theatre_philly.asp "The Forrest Theatre, Philadelphia"] Shubert Organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6178">The '''empirical study of literature''' is an interdisciplinary field of research which includes the [[psychology]], [[Sociology of literature|sociology]], [[Philosophy]], the contextual study of literature, and the [[History of literature|history]] of [[Reading (process)|reading]] [[Literature|literary]] [[Text (literary theory)|texts]].

The [[International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature]] and Media (IGEL) is one learned association which brings together experts in this field. Major journals in the field are ''[[Poetics (journal)|Poetics: Journal of Empirical Research on Culture, the Media and the Arts]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/poetics/|title=Poetics|work=Publisher's Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Poetics Today: International Journal for Theory and Analysis of Literature and Communication]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://poeticstoday.dukejournals.org/|title=Poetics Today|work=Publisher's Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Scientific Study of Literature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/ssol/main|title=SSOL|work=Publisher's Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The empirical study of literature attracts scholarship particularly in the areas of reception and audience studies and in cognitive psychology when it is concerned with questions of reading. In these two areas research and studies based on the framework are steadily growing. Further fields where the framework in various revised and expanded versions attracts scholarship is (comparative) cultural studies and pedagogy. One of several dictionary definitions of the field is as follows:

“Movement within the study of literature concerned with the study of literature as a social system of [inter]actions. The main question is what happens to literature: it is written, published, distributed, read, censored, imitated, etc. The empirical study of literature originated as a reaction to, and an attempt at, solving the basic problem of hermeneutics; that is, how the validation of literary interpretation can be demonstrated. From reception theory it had already become clear that interpretations are not only tied to the text, but also, and even to a great extent, to the reader — both in terms of the individual and of social conventions. This led to the theory of radical (cognitive) constructivism, based on the thesis that the subject largely construes its empirical world itself. The logical consequence of all this, to be seen in the work of Siegfried J. Schmidt, is the separation of interpretation and the strictly scientific study of literature based on radical constructivism. The literary system of actions is observed from the outside — not experienced — and roughly characterized as depending on two conventions (hypotheses) that are tested continually. These conventions are the aesthetic convention (as opposed to the convention of facts in the daily language of reference) and the polyvalence convention (as opposed to the monovalency in the daily empirical world). Thus, the object of study of the empirical study of literature is not only the text in itself, but the roles of action within the literary system, namely, production, distribution, reception, and the processing of texts. The methods used are primarily taken from the social sciences, reception theory, cognitive science, psychology, etc. In general the steps to be taken in empirical research are the formation of a hypothesis, putting it into practice, testing, and evaluation. More concretely, for the study of reader response a wide array of techniques are used, ranging from protocol techniques and thinking aloud protocol to pre-structured techniques, such as the semantic seven point scale (C. Osgood) and the classification technique (card sorting), and forms of content analysis, discourse analysis, association techniques, etc. Some objections often raised to the empirical study of literature are the triviality of many of its research results such as confirmation of what was already known or suspected or its reductionism (artificiality of the framework and set-up, and limitation to reader response instead of the study of the text). It is clear, however, that the empirical study of literature by its specific approach of the object and its focus on methodology is an outstanding way to explore the socio-cultural aspects of the literary system. It makes an irreplaceable contribution to the development of a more rational, scientific, and socially relevant study of literature.” &lt;ref&gt;Hendrik van Gorp, R. Ghesquiere, D. Delabastita and J. Flamend: „Empirische literatuurwetenschap.“ In: ''Lexicon van literaire termen: stromingen en genres, theoretische begrippen, retorische procédés en stiljfiguren''. By Hendrik van Gorp, R.

A '''figure of thought''' ({{lang-la|figurae sententiarum}}, {{lang-el|schemata dianoias}}) is a [[rhetorical device]] sometimes distinguished from [[figure of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;Gideon O. Burton, [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Figures/Figures%20of%20Speech-Thought.htm "Figures of speech/figures of thought"], ''Silva Rhetoricae'', Brigham Young University&lt;/ref&gt; In another sense the term has been used in the study of diagrams and drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Dirmoser, [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-7091-0803-1_12#page-1 "Figures of Thought: The Use of Diagrams in Science and Art"], in "Drawing a Hypothesis", pp. 153-160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to Latin literature==
It may be difficult to draw the distinction between figures of speech and figures of thought, especially when the primary area of inquiry is [[poetry]] rather than a prose composition, which adheres to the rules of rhetorical theory that were for the most part created in their fullest articulation in the age of [[Quintilian]] (c. 35 – c. 100). In their approach to language, the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poets ([[Horace]], [[Catullus]], [[Propertius]], [[Tibullus]]) did not distinguish between ''[[inventio]]'' and ''[[elocutio]]'', which explains somewhat our confusion between figures of thought and figures of speech. The latter are exemplified most immediately by conceptual substitutions, such as [[metaphor]] or [[synecdoche]], but if we consider not just the mere ''linguistic'' aspect of the substitution and focus most closely on the concepts themselves, then we may perceive the comprehensiveness of the conceptual for the poet, who operates with words to extend and amplify the potential semantics of poetic output.

==Uses of the term==
[[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] used the term in relation to the philosophy of [[Plato]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Plato’s dialectic makes continual use of figures of speech, which are really figures of thought."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/A_Figure_of_Speech_or_a_Figure_of_Thought_Part_1-by_Ananda_Coomaraswamy.aspx "A Figure of Speech, or a Figure of Thought?"], Studies in Comparative Religion, Vol. 6, No. 1, Winter 1972&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The scholar of [[Latin literature]] Gordon Williams (died 2010)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2744529.ece "Gordon Williams: Scholar who introduced many to the pleasures of Latin poetry" (obituary)], The Times (London), 29 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; published a study titled ''Figures of Thought in Roman Poetry'' (1980), stating in the introduction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[[Language]] was subject to ordering by exhaustive description of vocabulary, syntax, and figures. The content was likewise subject to ordering by the rules of ''[[inventio]]'' (the technique by which all the latent or inherent possibilities in a given idea or cluster of ideas could be 'discovered' and exploited)."&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A collection of drawings by Nikolaus Gansterer (2011) was titled "Drawing a Hypothesis: Figures of Thought".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.a-n.co.uk/reviews/drawing-a-hypothesis-figures-of-thought "Drawing a Hypothesis: Figures of thought"], a-n The Artists Information Company, 19 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to the Floriade in the Netherlands, flower and garden shows were called ''Flora'' Exhibitions held at [[Groenendaal park]] in [[Heemstede]] in 1925, 1935 and 1953, and earlier in 1910 in the [[Haarlemmerhout ]] in [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flora1935.nl/|title=Flora-archief}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Floriade was held in [[Rotterdam]] in Het Park with the [[Euromast]] being erected to mark the event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euromast.nl/en/about-the-euromast/history|accessdate=4 June 2014|title=History - Euromast}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Organization==
The Floriade is coordinated by the ''Dutch Horticultural Council''. The Dutch Horticultural Council was founded in 1908 and aims to strengthen the image of the Dutch horticulture and to promote exports.The location varies and is awarded to a city after a [[bidding]] phase.

==Founders==
HitFix was founded by ex-Reed Business Information Development executive Jen Sargent and former ''[[L.A. Times]]'' and [[MSN.com]] film editor Gregory Ellwood. Sargent and Ellwood's goal was to create a site that fit into the gap between trade publications and gossip- or celebrity-scandal-driven sites, such as [[TMZ.com|TMZ]], and to target an audience slightly skewed towards males – a unique approach in a female-driven industry&lt;ref name="multiple3"&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997435?refCatId=18 Article on Variety.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107120828/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997435?refCatId=18 |date=November 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – while catering to 18- to 34-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socaltech.com/interview_with_jennifer_sargent_hitfix/s-0036989.html/ socaltech.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513223014/http://www.socaltech.com/interview_with_jennifer_sargent_hitfix/s-0036989.html/ |date=May 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Angel investment==

HitFix received its first funding from Golden Seeds, the fourth largest angel investment group in the United States, in 2009.  Since then, HitFix has twice benefited from investment from the [[Tech coast angels|Tech Coast Angels]], one of the largest angel investment networks in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socaltech.com/venture_capital_totals_6_3__m_in_southern_california_in_q3/s-0038812.html|work=socaltech.com|publisher=|title=Venture Capital Totals $603.2M In Southern California In Q3|date=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first such investment came in February 2009 in the amount of $850,000. In June 2010, the Angels added to their commitment investing an additional $1,600,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techcoastangels.com/press/tech-coast-angels-joins-16m-investment-hitfix-unique-content-driven-entertainment-website Tech Coast Angels Joins $1.6M Investment in HitFix, Unique Content Driven Entertainment Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723202250/http://www.techcoastangels.com/press/tech-coast-angels-joins-16m-investment-hitfix-unique-content-driven-entertainment-website |date=2013-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to Golden Seeds and Tech Coast Angels, HitFix investors include HBS Angels, Liquid Capital, and Gordon Crawford.

==History==

=== Founding and Establishment ===
iflix was founded by [[Patrick Grove]], CEO of [[Catcha Group]], Mark Britt and Evolution Media, a merchant bank focused on the media, sports, and entertainment industries.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techinasia.com/iflix-brings-hollywood-to-southeast-asia|title=With iFlix, Patrick Grove wants to bring the best of Hollywood to Southeast Asia|date=10 March 2015|website=Tech in Asia|publisher=techinasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; iflix was created for the rapidly growing, emerging middle-class population and their increasing demand for entertainment content. The company set out to address a certain set of conditions, which tend to exist universally across emerging markets – prevalence of [[piracy]], inconsistent infrastructure, inconsistent quality and distribution of internet connectivity, expensive and limited mobile data, low paid television penetration, low credit-card penetration and a lack of familiarity with online payment options – through technology and commercial partnerships.

In April 2015, iflix announced the completion of a $30&amp;nbsp;million round of funding, led by leading international investment firm, Catcha Group and [[Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company]] (PLDT), the largest integrated telecommunications company in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.iflix.com/images/media/press/iflix%20_raises_30_million.pdf|title = IFLIX RAISES $30M, PRIMED FOR GROWTH|date = 23 April 2015|website = Media Room|publisher = iflix}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company launched its service in Malaysia and the Philippines one month later,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.iflix.com/images/media/press/iflix_now_available.pdf|title = iFLIX NOW AVAILABLE|date = 27 May 2015|website = Media Room|publisher = iflix}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they additionally announced the formation of its Advisory Board, composed of Hollywood business and creative leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.iflix.com/images/media/press/iflix_Announces_Advisory_Board.pdf|title = iFLIX ANNOUNCES ADVISORY BOARD|date = 22 May 2015|website = Media Room|publisher = iflix}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July, iflix recorded over 100,000 subscribers, becoming Southeast Asia's fastest growing Internet TV service.&lt;ref name="restored_4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.iflix.com/images/media/press/23_07_2015_iflix_SEAs_Fastest_Growing.pdf|title = iFLIX RECORDS OVER 100,000 SUBSCRIBERS AS SOUTHEAST ASIA'S FASTEST GROWING INTERNET TV SERVICE|date = 23 July 2015|website = Media Room|publisher = iflix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the 12-week trial phase of its official launch in Thailand in November, iflix drew close to 200,000 subscribers.&lt;ref name="restored_5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.iflix.com/images/media/press/iflix-Launches-in-Thailand-and-Welcomes-Top-Celebs-to-the-iflix-Family.pdf|title = iFLIX OFFICIALLY LAUNCHES IN THAILAND &amp; WELCOMES TOP CELEBS TO THE iFLIX FAMILY|date = 30 November 2015|website = Media Room|publisher = iflix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Opening Party was held on the 17th, showcases on the 18th, and the main conference on the 19th and 20th. The main conference venue was changed to the [[Osaka Museum of History]] which also served as co-sponsor. In response to the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], participating musicians did a tribute performance and benefit drive for [[Haiti]] [[refugee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansaimusicconference.com/2010/kmc.html |title=KMC 2010|publisher=Kansaimusicconference.com|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable performers and attendees included [[Katie Rox]] from [[Canada]] and [[Adam Tyler (musician)|Adam Tyler]] from the [[United States of America|US]]. This year saw the addition of an English [[rakugo]] (traditional Japanese comedy in English) show and a grand finale on the 19th that featured several performers doing a tribute to the victims of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansaimusicconference.com/2011/kmc.html |title=KMC 2011|publisher=Kansaimusicconference.com|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012===

Among some of the events and performers was a [[shamisen]] workshop (traditional Japanese instrument) and an awards ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansaimusicconference.com/conference.html |title=KMC 2012|publisher=Kansaimusicconference.com|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2014 ===

=== 2015 ===

The 2015 conference included sponsored events by [[D'Addario]], as well as workshops including the popular English [[rakugo]] show and [[Gospel music|gospel]] workshops. Also special for 2015 was a feature of [[Music of Latvia|music from Latvia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2003111/KMC%202015%20Program.pdf|title = KMC 2015 Program|last =|first =|date =|website = KMC 2015 Program|publisher = Kansai Music Conference|access-date = April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 ===
KMC 2016 will be held from September 16 - 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kansaimusicconference.com/conference.html|title = KMC - Music Conference|website = www.kansaimusicconference.com|access-date = 2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Success Stories==
KMC has had several accomplishments in its first 3 years. Osaka band Riot Dance Party was able to make their first tour overseas in [[Australia]] through connections made with an Aussie band at a KMC show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.jp/boudoudanceparty/news-e.html |title=RDP history page|publisher=Geocities.jp|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another connection was made when American [[hip hop]] artist, Legrande, met with a professor at [[Temple University, Japan Campus|Temple University Japan Campus]] in Tokyo to collaborate on a project with college students to create a character in [[Second Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linsl.info/making-of |title=Legrande "Making Of"|publisher=Linsl.info|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian singer-songwriter [[Katie Rox]] has commented on her success at KMC in an interview with Canadian music news site North By East West, saying,  “I have noticed CD sales, twitter and Facebook followers have increased since the trip, so I would say it was a success!”&lt;ref name="NXEW article on Rox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nxew.ca/?p=6393 |title=NXEW article on Rox|publisher=Nxew.ca|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rox explained the value of the conference in her view, saying further that the conference is especially valuable to independent musicians that lack the support of a [[major label]]. “You need to make it known who you are. That can be hard without label support.”&lt;ref name="NXEW article on Rox"/&gt;

KMC has built up a team of sponsors, partners, and supporters, both in Japan and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansaimusicconference.com/sponsor.html |title=KMC Sponsors|publisher=Kansaimusicconference.com|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, several charity drives for [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake]] victims have been organized by the KMC Executive Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osakacafebar.blog75.fc2.com/blog-entry-258.html |title=Osaka Cafe charity information|publisher=Osakacafebar.blog75.fc2.com|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
KMC provides a forum for [[independent music]]ians around the world to network with other musicians, music related companies and organizations, experience the [[live music]] scene in Japan, as well as participate in seminars, presentations and workshops about music and the [[music industry]]. There is little precedent for such an event in Japan.

As an independently organized event, KMC currently does not attract big companies, [[major label]] reps, and [[music industry]] executives like similar events in other countries, due to the general unfamiliarity of the concept and closed nature of the Japanese music industry. According to Levi, “It’s amazing how artists with such talent are practicing and performing with almost no attention from the music industry… It’s almost impossible for independent musicians in Japan to move up to the next level without help from a major company. KMC is my way of affecting change—a change to a better and more rewarding music scene in Japan.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metropolis.co.jp/arts/japan-beat/kansai-music-conference-japan-music-week/ |title=Metropolis magazine article on KMC and Japan Music Week|publisher=Metropolis.co.jp|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Each volume of ''Little Lit'' is a collection of original [[comics]] created expressly for children, authored by major cartoonists and literary figures.  Contributors include writers such as [[Paul Auster]], [[Neil Gaiman]], and [[David Sedaris]]; cartoonists such as [[Daniel Clowes]], [[Tony Millionaire]], and [[Chris Ware]]; and children's writers such as [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]],  [[Barbara McClintock (illustrator)|Barbara McClintock]] and [[Lemony Snicket]] ([[Daniel Handler]]). Volume one includes a vintage cartoon by [[Walt Kelly]].

The series began publication in 2000 with a 64-page hardcover book, ''Little Lit: Folklore &amp; Fairy Tale Funnies''. This was followed by two subsequent volumes, ''Strange Stories for Strange Kids'', and ''It Was a Dark and Silly Night...'' The third volume deviated slightly from previous versions, reducing the page count to 48 pages.

A smaller-sized paperback book called ''Big Fat Little Lit'' was published in 2006 by [[Puffin Books]]. This volume is a 144-page collection of selected comics from the first three [[HarperCollins]] books.

'''''Living Books''''' was a series of [[interactive storybook]]s for children, first produced by [[Brøderbund]] and then spun off into a jointly owned (with [[Random House]]) subsidiary, which were distributed on [[CD-ROM]] for [[Mac OS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. The series began in January 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1995 Online Annual Report |url=http://www.broder.com/company/investor/95ar-7.html#timeline |work= |publisher=[[Broderbund]] |date=1995 |accessdate=September 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970411081549/http://www.broder.com:80/company/investor/95ar-7.html#timeline |archivedate=April 11, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the release of ''[[Just Grandma and Me]]'' (an adaptation of the book by [[Mercer Mayer]]) in 1992 till it ended in 1998; other titles in the series included ''[[The Tortoise and the Hare]]'', ''[[Arthur's Teacher Trouble]]'' (and other adaptations of books by [[Marc Brown (author)|Marc Brown]]), ''[[Dr. Seuss]]'', ''[[P.

Atlantan production company Red Rubber Ball (later Little Ark Interactive) created a series of biblical-themes interactive storybooks under contract from Living Books in the late 1990s, and developed under the direction of members of the original Living Books team.

By 2013, [[Wanderful Interactive Storybooks|Wanderful, Inc.]] obtained the rights of the series and ported most of them to the [[iOS]] platforms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wanderful-storybooks/id583696319?mt=8|title=Wanderful Storybooks on the App Store|website=iTunes|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also added additional languages to the products.&lt;ref name="LB-Wanderful"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wanderfulstorybooks.com/|title=Wanderful Storybooks - Living Books|website=Wanderful Storybooks|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dr. Seuss]] and [[Little Critter]] titles were ported  to [[iOS]] by [[Oceanhouse Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oceanhousemedia.com/apps/index.html|title=Oceanhouse Media Apps|website=Oceanhouse|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first one was titled "Three for Me Library Volume 1™" which contained "[[Sheila Rae, the Brave]]", "Just Grandma and Me", "Little Monster at School", "The Berenstain Bears Get in a Fight", "Tortoise and the Hare", "Dr. Seuss's ABC", "Green Eggs and Ham", "The Cat in the Hat", "One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish" and "Harry and the Haunted House".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''The Three For Me Library Volume 2™'' |url=http://www.broderbund.com/studio/atoz/3forme2.html |work= |publisher= |author=[[Brøderbund]] |date=April 12, 1997 |accessdate=June 3, 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970412104717/http://www.broderbund.com/studio/atoz/3forme2.html |archivedate=April 12, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1993 praised ''Just Grandma and Me'' and ''Arthur's Teacher Trouble'', describing Living Books as "Broderbund's acclaimed series".&lt;ref name="cgw199304"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=105 | title=Forging Ahead or Fit to be Smashed? | work=Computer Gaming World | date=April 1993 | accessdate=July 6, 2014 | pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', in a review of ''Dr. Seuss' ABC'', called that title "one of the best children's CD-ROMs to date" and stated that, "[...] the producers' fondness for Dr. Seuss and their fidelity to his sense of refined silliness spill into every sequence."&lt;ref name=PB1&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 28, 1995 |title=Multimedia Reviews: Dr. Seuss' ABC |journal=[[Publishers Weekly]] |volume=242 |issue=35 |page=41 |publisher=Cahners Publishing Company |location=New York |issn=0000-0019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simson L. Garfinkel]] and [[Beth Rosenberg]] found that the CD-ROMs played better on Macs than on PCs. Although they found the titles to be of high quality in a market flooded with "questionable" releases for children, they stated that not all of them lived up to the company's educational claims (noting ''Dr. Seuss' ABC'' and ''Arthur's Reading Race'' as exceptions) and felt that the added dialogue supplementing the book's text was sometimes "out of character".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://simson.net/clips/1998/1998.Globe.02-05.Bringing_kids__books_to_life.htm |title=Bringing kids' books to life |accessdate=November 2, 2009 |last=Garfinkel |first=Simson L. |author2=Beth Rosenberg |date=February 5, 1998 |work=Boston Globe Online |publisher=Globe Newspaper Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Arthur's Teacher Trouble'', ''The Tortoise and the Hare'', ''Ruff's Bone'', and ''Little Monster at School'' all received a very high score of over 90.00 in the book ''CD-ROMs Rated'' by Les Kranz; in the review for ''Little Monster at School'', the graphics and the number of clickable areas were described as positives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=CD-ROMs Rated: A Guide to the Best and Worst CD ROMs &amp; Multimedia Titles |first1=Les |last1=Kranz |others=Laura L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3736">'''Marshal Scotty's Playland Park''' is an [[abandoned amusement park|abandoned theme park]] in the Flinn Springs area of 
unincorporated El Cajon, California, off [[Interstate 8]] on [[Lake Jennings Park Road]].
Frank Hobbs opened the park on Jan. 1, 1967. It was a Western-theme park, that's heyday was in the 70s and 80s.


The park contained multiple attractions on it's 25 acres, such as a railroad, a {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Ferris wheel]], a water slide, “Bulgy the Whale” ride, a small roller coaster called "The Little Dipper", a tilt-a-whirl ride, ring-the-bell boat ride, bumper cars, the Raging River Innertube Ride, and the River Canyon Raceway go-cart track. 

Bill Lee took it over in 1986, investing $500,000 to add a go-cart track and install the longest water slide of its kind in Southern California. In 1990, Lee filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. United Leisure Corp. of Fountain Valley purchased the property and equipment under foreclosure for $1.6 million in 1995, renaming the park, "Fraiser's Frontier." They ran a day camp for children, Camp Frasier in 1996 and 1997. 

The Park was closed in 1998 after rain badly damaged the park and equipment. 

The park is now privately owned and is now mostly abandoned and fenced off.&lt;ref name = "Pearlman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2011/nov/03/new-life-for-part-of-east-county-landmark/|title=New life for landmark MarshalScotty's|last=Pearlman|first=Karen|date=November 3, 2011|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The future of the park is unknown.&lt;ref name="Frasier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themeparkreview.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=40361&amp;start=2720|title=Shane's Amusement Attic Page 273|publisher=PAL|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It had a short lifespan as "Canyon Raceway," when husband-and-wife owners Rudy and Carrie Ludeke opened part of the park for go-cart racing. Canyon Raceway has since closed. Marshal Scotty’s Land has been for sale since 2014. 

Numerous relics are still visible from the road, through overgrown vegetation. In 2015, the park was opened during a few October weekend evenings as " Scotty's Scare Trail", a type of pre-Halloween amusement, ran by Ryan Powers and Dustin Parr. As of 2018, it is now called "The Haunted Amusement Park." The event annually raises money for a charity of the owner's selection, to include past charities, like Saving Horses, Inc., Lyonhearted Foundation, and non-profit group Team Parker for Life to help fund Childhood Cancer Research. A flyer for the 2015 event read, 
“….haunted by past park employees! This year, see the Bumper Car carnage, try to stay in one piece through the Slaughter trailer and the hunted [sic] park offices, visit the frighting [sic] ferris wheel….and don’t forget to brace yourself as you walk through the remains of the death coaster. Marshal Scary Scotty’s Scare Trail is packed full of spine tingling, heart pounding effects that are so real they will keep you screaming for your life as you try to find your way out.” 

Parts of The movie, “Scavenger Hunt," were filmed at Marshal Scotty’s Playland Park, in addition to various San Diego locations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7175">'''Montezuma''' was the name of a heroic-god in the [[mythology]] of certain [[Amerindian]] tribes of the Southwest United States, notably the [[Tohono O'odham]] and [[Pueblo people]]s — Also known as [[Aztec]] Emperors of the same name in Mexico, [[Moctezuma I]] and [[Moctezuma II]].

==Tohono O'odham version==

In the Tohono O'odham legend, at the beginning of time the [[Great Spirit]] finds clay by digging a hole; he then drops the clay into the hole again and out comes Montezuma, who assists him in bringing out all the Indian tribes, with the [[Apache]] last of all.  It is said that all men and animals were speaking a common language in the early days; however a great flood destroyed everyone, with only Montezuma and his friend, [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]], escaping.  Because Coyote had warned him of the flood beforehand, Montezuma had fashioned a boat that he kept prepared on the peak of the [[Santa Rosa Mountains (Arizona)|Santa Rosa Mountains]] in Arizona.  Coyote likewise made a boat for himself, by gnawing down a giant cane and stopping it with gum.

After the flood had subsided, Montezuma and Coyote meet again atop Monte Rosa, and Montezuma sends Coyote out four times, once in each direction, to find out how far the sea is.  He quickly returned from the south and the west, reporting that it was nearby.  The journey east took a bit longer, but eventually he found the sea there also.  Finally, he journeys northward and never finds water before growing tired.

Meanwhile, the Great Spirit, helped by Montezuma, has again repopulated the world with people and animals.  Montezuma is entrusted with the governance of mankind, but becoming proud and wicked, he rebels against the Great Spirit, dismisses Coyote, and commands mankind to build a house tall enough to reach Heaven.  Before he can succeed at this endeavour, the Great Spirit casts it down with thunderbolts, causing a confusion in the languages of mankind.

Persisting in his wickedness, Montezuma commands all the temples be destroyed; in response, the Great Spirit punishes him by sending a locust to the east to summon the Spanish, who make war on Montezuma and destroy him.

This legend was related by chief [[Con Quien]] of the Tohono O'odham and published in the ''Indian Affairs Report'' of 1865, p. 131. [[Hubert Howe Bancroft|Bancroft]], writing later in the 19th century (''Native Races'' vol 3), speculates that the name of the historical Aztec Emperors Moctezuma (more properly ''Motecuhzoma'' in Nahuatl) was the ultimate origin of the mythical hero-god's name &amp;mdash; the name being "gradually associated in the minds of some of the New Mexican and neighboring tribes, with a vague, mythical, and departed grandeur", until "all the lesser heroes would be gradually absorbed in the greater, and their names forgotten. Their deeds would become his deeds, their fame his fame."

However, other references among the Arizona and New Mexico tribes indicate a belief in "Montezuma" as having been the name of a great king and law-giver of the remote past, who ruled over a vast empire including Mexico, and who is said to be buried inside a particular mountain in Arizona that allegedly bears his image.

In 1737, a religious prophet appeared among the Guaima and [[Pima people|Pima]] Indians (''Akimel O'odham''), close relatives of the Tohono O'odham. This was Agustín Ascuchul, who claimed that the god Moctezuma had appeared to him and named him his prophet. He called on the Indians to follow him to a new place, to worship the god. More than 5,000 Indians abandoned their homes to follow the prophet. The governor of [[Sonora]], Juan Bautista de Anza, interpreted this as a rebellion. He soon suppressed it and hanged the prophet.

==Pueblo version==
Montezuma also figures prominently in the religion of the Pueblo Indians, who held that their god-king Montezuma was variously from [[Taos Pueblo|Taos]], [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]], or one of the other pueblos, and was conceived from a beautiful virgin and a [[pinyon pine]] nut. Although weak as a youth, he was chosen to be their unlikely leader, and surprised everyone with his miracles, including the ability to produce rain. He taught the people their customs, and how to build the adobe pueblos. One day he kindled a fire that they were never to allow to burn out, then departed for Mexico (in some versions, on the back of an eagle), promising to return some day and save them from the Spanish.  

U.S. Attorney W.W.H. Davis, who visited the [[Laguna Pueblo]] in 1855, was allowed a rare glimpse at some sort of idol or icon of their god Montezuma, whereof he gave a vivid description in his book ''El Gringo''.  According to Davis, this object was round, nine inches tall and in diameter, and made of tanned skin.  The cover was painted half red and half green, and on the green side were triangular holes for eyes, round pieces of leather for the mouth and ears, and no nose. He said it was kept wrapped in cloth, and was sprinkled with a 'white powder'.

The Swiss-American ethnographer [[Adolph Francis Alphonse Bandelier|Adolph Bandelier]] asserted in the 1890s that these legends had been invented by the Pueblos fifty years earlier solely to impress American explorers, and were not really part of their religion; he cited a document purporting to be a secret plot to 'teach' the natives that they were the descendants of Emperor Montezuma for political purposes, during the [[Mexican–American War]]. However, other documents have since come to light showing that the Spanish too were quite aware of Montezuma's renown in the Pueblo region long before then—the earliest such recorded reference dating to 1694, when the natives told Jesuit Father [[Eusebio Francisco Kino]] that Montezuma had built what is today known as [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande]] (Wilson 1999, p.16).

Finally, Llewellyn Harris, a Welsh-American [[Mormon]] missionary who visited the [[Zuni people|Zuni]] in 1878, claimed that they told him they were descended from Montezuma, who was himself descended from white men called "Cambaraga" who came from over the sea 300 years before the Spanish, and that they still had many Welsh words in their language (see [[Madoc]] for many more tales along this theme). However, these much more sensational claims have never been independently verified.

'''Onyx Path Publishing''' (aka '''The Onyx Path''') is a role-playing game company that produces licensed products as well as company-owned and creator-owned games.

== History ==
The name "The Onyx Path" and the company's logo appeared on [[White Wolf Publishing|White Wolf]] products and their message board in early 2012. There was some speculation about their meaning before the company went public with their plans during [[GenCon]] in August 2012.&lt;ref name="RPG Geek" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzjC6lD7JCs What is the Onxy Path? Panel from GenCon on YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FantasyHeartbreaker"&gt;[http://blog.fantasyheartbreaker.com/tag/cavaliers-of-mars/ Fantasy Heartbreaker Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company had already been founded in January 2012&lt;ref name="RPG Geek" /&gt; by White Wolf Creative Director Richard Thomas,&lt;ref name="TOP FAQ"&gt;http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/&lt;/ref&gt; and is licensee for White Wolf's ''[[World of Darkness]]'' lines (''Classic World of Darkness'' and ''New World of Darkness''),&lt;ref name="TOP FAQ"/&gt; as well as ''[[Exalted]]''.&lt;ref name="TOP FAQ"/&gt; The company also bought outright the ''[[Trinity Universe]]'' and ''[[Scion (role-playing game)|Scion]]'' games from [[White Wolf Publishing|White Wolf]]/[[CCP Games]].&lt;ref name="TOP FAQ"/&gt; As such, Onyx Path Publishing will release the titles that were previously announced by White Wolf for the 2012/2013 schedule. Products will be made available through [[DriveThruRPG]] electronically ([[PDF]] files) and physically via DriveThruRPG's [[print on demand]] service.&lt;ref name="TOP FAQ"/&gt; In addition to that, Onyx Path Publishing has used the crowd funding service [[Kickstarter]] to raise money for deluxe editions of some of their new products.&lt;ref name="TOP FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/200664283/created Kickstarter Projects created by Richard Thomas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/200664283/deluxe-werewolf-the-apocalypse-20th-anniversary-ed Werewolf: The Apocalypse 20th Anniversary Deluxe and Heavy Metal Edition Kickstarter]&lt;/ref&gt;

Onyx Path Publishing is also developing original games, including ''Cavaliers of Mars'' by Rose Bailey&lt;ref name="FantasyHeartbreaker" /&gt; and Pugmire by Eddy Webb.&lt;ref&gt;http://elliedi.com/be-a-good-dog-eddy-webb-talks-about-the-pugmire-rpg/&lt;/ref&gt; The homepage of Onyx Path Publishing also provides guidelines to send in material, in case one would want to have one's own game to be published by them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theonyxpath.com/submission-guidelines/ Onyx Path Publishing - Submission Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ouija''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|iː|dʒ|ə}} {{respell|WEE|jə}}), also known as a '''spirit board''' or '''talking board''', is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0–9, the words "yes", "no", "hello" (occasionally), and "goodbye", along with various symbols and graphics. It uses a small heart-shaped piece of wood or plastic called a [[planchette]]. Participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it is moved about the board to spell out words. "Ouija" was formerly a trademark  belonging to [[Parker Brothers]], and has subsequently become a trademark of [[Hasbro, Inc.]] in the United States,&lt;ref name=uspto1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ouija_board|title=Ouija board {{!}} Definition of Ouija board in English by Oxford Dictionaries|last=|first=|date=|website=[[oxforddictionaries.com]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is often used [[generic trademark|generically]] to refer to any talking board. According to Hasbro, players take turns asking questions and then "wait to see what the planchette spells out" for them. It is recommended for players over the age of 8.&lt;ref name="HasbroInstructions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ouija Board (2001) Instructions - Hasbro|url=https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Ouija_Board_%282001%29.pdf|website=Hasbro.com|publisher=[[Hasbro, Inc.]]|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its commercial introduction by businessman [[Elijah Bond]] on July 1, 1890,&lt;ref name=uspto1&gt;{{cite web |title=US Trademark Registration Number 0519636 under First Use in Commerce |url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=71546217&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch |publisher=tsdr.uspto.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ouija board was regarded as a parlor game unrelated to the occult until American [[spiritualism|spiritualist]] Pearl Curran popularized its use as a divining tool during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Brunvand"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brunvand |first=Jan Harold |authorlink=Jan Harold Brunvand |title=American folklore: an encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0N_sedAATAC&amp;pg=PA534 |year=1998 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-8153-3350-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritualists claimed that the dead were able to contact the living and reportedly used a talking board very similar to a modern ouija board at their camps in Ohio in 1886 to ostensibly enable faster communication with spirits.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Strange and Mysterious History of the ouija Board |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-strange-and-mysterious-history-of-the-ouija-board-5860627/?no-ist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church and other [[Christian denomination]]s have "warned against using ouija boards", holding that they can lead to [[demonic possession]].&lt;ref name="Bill Ellis - Warnings"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oLcqlypMCe8C&amp;pg=PA65 |title=Raising the devil: Satanism, new religions, and the media |quote=Practically since its invention a century ago, mainstream Christian religions, including Catholicism, have warned against the use of oujia boards, claiming that they are a means of dabbling with Satanism (Hunt 1985:93-95). Occultists are divided on the oujia board's value. Jane Roberts (1966) and Gina Covina (1979) express confidence that it is a device for positive transformation and they provide detailed instructions on how to use it to contact spirits and map the other world. But some occultists have echoed Christian warnings, cautioning inexperienced persons away from it. |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |accessdate=31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carlisle2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlisle |first=Rodney P. |title=Encyclopedia of Play in Today's Society |date=2 April 2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=9781412966702 |page=434 |quote=In particular, Ouija boards and automatic writing are kin in that they can be practiced and explained both by parties who see them as instruments of psychological discovery; and both are abhorred by some religious groups as gateways to demonic possession, as the abandonment of will and invitation to external forces represents for them an act much like presenting an open wound to a germ-filled environment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Occultists]], on the other hand, are divided on the issue, with some saying that it can be a positive transformation; others reiterate the warnings of many Christians and caution "inexperienced users" against it.&lt;ref name="Bill Ellis - Warnings"/&gt;

[[Paranormal]] and [[supernatural]] beliefs associated with Ouija have been harshly criticized by the scientific community, since they are characterized as [[pseudoscience]]. The action of the board can be [[Occam's razor|parsimoniously]] explained by unconscious movements of those controlling the pointer, a [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] phenomenon known as the [[ideomotor effect]].&lt;ref name="Shermer2"&gt;Heap, Michael.

==History==

===Precursors===
[[Image:Changchun-Temple-Master-and-disciples-painting-0316.jpg|thumb|Wang Chongyang, founder of the Quanzhen School, depicted in Changchun Temple, [[Wuhan]]]]

One of the first mentions of the [[automatic writing]] method used in the ouija board is found in [[China]] around 1100 AD, in historical documents of the [[Song Dynasty]]. The method was known as [[fuji (planchette writing)|''fuji'']] "planchette writing". The use of planchette writing as an ostensible means of [[necromancy]] and communion with the spirit-world continued, and, albeit under special rituals and supervisions, was a central practice of the [[Quanzhen School]], until it was forbidden by the [[Qing Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Silvers, Brock. The Taoist Manual (Honolulu: Sacred Mountain Press, 2005), p. 129–132.&lt;/ref&gt; Several entire scriptures of the [[Daozang]] are supposedly works of automatic planchette writing. According to one author, similar methods of mediumistic spirit writing have been practiced in [[ancient India]], [[Greece]], [[Roman Empire|Rome]], and [[medieval Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Chao Wei-pang. 1942. "The origin and Growth of the Fu Chi", Folklore Studies 1:9–27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Talking boards===
As a part of the [[spiritualism|spiritualist]] movement, mediums began to employ various means for communication with the dead. Following the American Civil War in the United States, mediums did significant business in presumably allowing survivors to contact lost relatives. The ouija itself was created and named in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1890, but the use of talking boards was so common by 1886 that news reported the phenomenon taking over the spiritualists' camps in Ohio.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;

===Commercial parlor game===
[[File:English ouija board.jpg|thumb|left|A modern Ouija board and [[planchette]]]]
Businessman [[Elijah Bond]] had the idea to [[patent]] a [[planchette]] sold with a board on which the alphabet was printed, much like the previously existing talking boards. The patentees filed on May 28, 1890 for patent protection and thus are credited with the invention of the Ouija board. Issue date on the patent was February 10, 1891. They received {{US patent|446054}}. Bond was an attorney and was an inventor of other objects in addition to this device.

An employee of Elijah Bond, [[William Fuld]], took over the talking board production. In 1901, Fuld started production of his own boards under the name "Ouija".&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web |last=Orlando |first=Eugene |title=Ancient Ouija Boards: Fact or Fiction? |url=http://www.museumoftalkingboards.com/ancient.html |work=Museum of Talking Boards |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Kennard (founder of Kennard Novelty Company which manufactured Fuld's talking boards and where Fuld had worked as a varnisher) claimed he learned the name "Ouija" from using the board and that it was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian word meaning "good luck." When Fuld took over production of the boards, he popularized the more widely accepted etymology: that the name came from a combination of the French and German words for "yes".&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius, J. E. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mWrFC3gax3UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=aleister+crowley+ouija&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aIdsTLeLKsH-8Ab4zPzBDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Aleister Crowley and the Ouija Board''], pp. 20–21. Feral House, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fuld name became synonymous with the Ouija board, as Fuld reinvented its history, claiming that he himself had invented it. The strange talk about the boards from Fuld's competitors flooded the market, and all these boards enjoyed a heyday from the 1920s.

Various studies have been produced, recreating the effects of the ouija board in the lab and showing that, under laboratory conditions, the subjects were moving the planchette involuntarily.&lt;ref name="lab"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Garrow |first=Hattie Brown |title=Suffolk's Lakeland High teens find their own answers |publisher=The Virginian-Pilot |date=1 December 2008 |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2008/11/suffolks-lakeland-high-teens-find-their-own-answers}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study found that when answering yes or no questions, ouija use was significantly more accurate than guesswork, suggesting that it might draw on the unconscious mind.&lt;ref name="ubc_gauchou"/&gt; Skeptics have described ouija board users as 'operators'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dickerson |first=Brian |title=Crying rape through a Ouija board |work=Detroit Free Press |publisher=McClatchy – Tribune Business News |date=6 February 2008 |url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080206/COL04/802060366/1081|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics noted that the messages ostensibly spelled out by spirits were similar to whatever was going through the minds of the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tucker |first=Milo Asem |title=Comparative Observations on the Involuntary Movements of Adults and Children |journal=The American Journal of Psychology |volume=8 |issue=3 |page=402 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |date=Apr 1897 |jstor=1411486 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Professor of neurology [[Terence Hines]] in his book ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal'' (2003):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The planchette is guided by unconscious muscular exertions like those responsible for table movement. Nonetheless, in both cases, the illusion that the object (table or planchette) is moving under its own control is often extremely powerful and sufficient to convince many people that spirits are truly at work... The unconscious muscle movements responsible for the moving tables and Ouija board phenomena seen at seances are examples of a class of phenomena due to what psychologists call a dissociative state. A dissociative state is one in which consciousness is somehow divided or cut off from some aspects of the individual's normal cognitive, motor, or sensory functions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hines|Hines, Terence]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 47. {{ISBN|1-57392-979-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ouija boards were already criticized by scholars early on, being described in a 1927 journal as {{"'}}vestigial remains' of primitive belief-systems" and a con to part fools from their money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Howerth |first=I. W. |title=Science and Religion |magazine=[[The Scientific Monthly]] |volume=25 |issue=2 |page=151 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |date=Aug 1927 |jstor=7828 |doi=10.2307/7828}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 1921 journal described reports of ouija board findings as 'half truths' and suggested that their inclusion in national newspapers at the time lowered the national discourse overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lloyd |first=Alfred H. |title=Newspaper Conscience--A Study in Half-Truths |journal=The American Journal of Sociology |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=198–205 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |date=Sep 1921 |jstor=2764824 |doi=10.1086/213304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s ouija board users were also described as "[[cult]] members" by sociologists, though this was severely scrutinised in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robbins |first=Thomas |author2=Dick Anthony |title=The Sociology of Contemporary Religious Movements |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=5 |pages=81–7 |publisher=Annual Reviews |year=1979 |jstor=2945948 |doi=10.1146/annurev.so.05.080179.000451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since early in the Ouija board's history, it has been criticized by several [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations.&lt;ref name="Bill Ellis - Warnings"/&gt; For example, ''[[Catholic Answers]]'', a Roman Catholic [[Christian apologetics]] organization, states that "The Ouija board is far from harmless, as it is a form of divination (seeking information from supernatural sources)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.catholic.com/qa/are-ouija-boards-harmless|title=Are Ouija boards harmless? |year=2011 |work=[[Catholic Answers]] |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Catholic Christian [[bishop]]s in [[Micronesia]] called for the boards to be banned and warned congregations that they were talking to [[Demon#Christianity|demons]] when using Ouija boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dernbach |first=Katherine Boris |title=Spirits of the Hereafter: Death, Funerary Possession, and the Afterlife in Chuuk, Micronesia |journal=Ethnology |volume=44 |issue=2 |page=99 |location=Pittsburgh |date=Spring 2005 |jstor=3773992 |doi=10.2307/3773992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[pastoral letter]], The [[Free Reformed Churches of North America|Dutch Reformed Churches]] encouraged its communicants to avoid Ouija boards, as it is a practice "related to the occult".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frcna.org/messenger/item/7420-/7420-|title=Pastoral Letter Issued by the Free Reformed Churches of North America Out of concern for all confessing and baptized members|year=1995|publisher=[[Free Reformed Churches of North America]]|language=English|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] also forbids its faithful from using Ouija boards as it teaches that such would be a violation of the [[Ten Commandments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portagelutheranchurch.org/home/180011422/180011422/Images/January%20Newsletter-2016.pdf|title=What Does God Tell Us To Do In The Second Commandment?|last=Schultz|first=Scott|year=2016|publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]|page=3|language=English|accessdate=8 March 2018|quote=A final way we misuse God's name is when we use any type of witchcraft such as crystal balls, Ouija boards, tarot cards, etc. Using these things are sinful because we are asking the devil to help us instead of God.

===Literature===
&lt;!-- Note: this section is about literature written, at least partially, by USING a Ouija board, not literature ABOUT Ouija boards --&gt;
Ouija boards have been the source of inspiration for literary works, used as guidance in writing or as a form of [[Mediumship|channeling]] literary works. As a result of Ouija boards' becoming popular in the early 20th century, by the 1920s many "psychic" books were written of varying quality often initiated by ouija board use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=White |first=Stewart Edward |authorlink=Stewart Edward White |title=The Betty Book |publisher=E.

* Emily Grant Hutchings claimed that her novel ''[[Jap Herron: A Novel Written from the Ouija Board]]'' (1917) was dictated by [[Mark Twain]]'s spirit through the use of a Ouija board after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twainquotes.com/19170909.html |title=Book Review - Jap Herron |publisher=Twainquotes.com |accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pearl Lenore Curran (February 15, 1883 – December 4, 1937), alleged that for over 20 years she was in contact with a spirit named [[Patience Worth]].
** This [[symbiotic]] relationship produced several novels, and works of poetry and prose, which Pearl Curran claimed were delivered to her through channelling Worth's spirit during sessions with a ouija board, and which works Curran then transcribed.
* Much of [[William Butler Yeats]]'s later poetry was inspired, among other facets of occultism, by the Ouija board. Yeats himself did not use it, but his wife did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Conradt |first=Stacy |website=Mental Floss |title=The Quick 10: 10 Famous Uses of the Ouija Board |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/26158/quick-10-10-famous-uses-ouija-board |date=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In late 1963, [[Jane Roberts]] and her husband Robert Butts started experimenting with a ouija board as part of Roberts' research for a book on [[extra-sensory perception]].&lt;ref&gt;''ESP Power'', by Jane Roberts (2000) (introductory essay by Lynda Dahl). {{ISBN|0-88391-016-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** According to Roberts and Butts, on December 2, 1963 they began to receive coherent messages from a male personality ( an 'energy personality essence no longer focused in the physical world') who eventually identified himself as "Seth", culminating in a series of books dictated by "Seth".
* In 1982, poet [[James Merrill]] released an [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] 560-page [[epic poem]] titled ''[[The Changing Light at Sandover]]'', which documented two decades of messages dictated from the Ouija board during séances hosted by Merrill and his partner [[David Noyes Jackson]].
** ''Sandover'', which received the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] in 1983,&lt;ref name=NBCC&gt;{{cite web |title=All Past National Book Critics Circle Awards Winners and Finalists |url=http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/ |publisher=National Book Critics Circle |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in three volumes beginning in 1976.

===Aleister Crowley===
[[Aleister Crowley]] had great admiration for the use of the ouija board and it played a passing role in his magical workings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Cornelious, J. Edward ''Aleister Crowley and the Ouija Board'' 2005 {{ISBN|978-1-932595-10-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://feralhouse.com/press/mini_sites/ouija/ Mini site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024005405/http://feralhouse.com/press/mini_sites/ouija/ |date=2006-10-24 }} J. Edward's book, ''Aleister Crowley and the Ouija Board''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane Wolfe]], who lived with Crowley at [[Abbey of Thelema]], also used the Ouija board. She credits some of her greatest spiritual communications to use of this implement. Crowley also discussed the Ouija board with another of his students, and the most ardent of them, [[Frater Achad]] ([[Charles Stansfeld Jones]]): it is frequently mentioned in their unpublished letters. In 1917 Achad experimented with the board as a means of summoning Angels, as opposed to [[Elemental]]s. In one letter Crowley told Jones:
::"Your Ouija board experiment is rather fun. You see how very satisfactory it is, but I believe things improve greatly with practice. I think you should keep to one angel, and make the magical preparations more elaborate."
Over the years, both became so fascinated by the board that they discussed marketing their own design. Their discourse culminated in a letter, dated February 21, 1919, in which Crowley tells Jones,
::"Re: Ouija Board. I offer you the basis of ten percent of my net profit. You are, if you accept this, responsible for the legal protection of the ideas, and the marketing of the copyright designs. I trust that this may be satisfactory to you. I hope to let you have the material in the course of a week."
In March, Crowley wrote to Achad to inform him,"I'll think up another name for Ouija." But their business venture never came to fruition and Crowley's new design, along with his name for the board, has not survived. Crowley has stated, of the Ouija Board that,
::There is, however, a good way of using this instrument to get what you want, and that is to perform the whole operation in a consecrated circle, so that undesirable aliens cannot interfere with it. You should then employ the proper magical invocation in order to get into your circle just the one spirit you want. It is comparatively easy to do this. A few simple instructions are all that is necessary, and I shall be pleased to give these, free of charge, to any one who cares to apply.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
Ouija boards have figured prominently in horror tales in various media as devices enabling malevolent spirits to spook their users.  Most often, they make brief appearances, relying heavily on the atmosphere of mystery the board already holds in the mind of the viewer, in order to add credence to the paranormal presence in the story being told.
===Books===
In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'', aliens from a distant star visit and oversee the Earth, and human users of a Ouija board spell out the name of their star, from the [[New General Catalogue]]. See [[Childhood's End#The Golden Age|The Golden Age]].

In [[Stephen King]]'s postapocalyptic novel ''[[The Stand]]'', Nadine Cross is contacted by [[Randall Flagg]] (also known as the dark man or Satan's Imp) twice via Ouija board.  The first time is unintentionally, in college; the second time, in post-plague Boulder, she deliberately opens herself up to the communication, with dire consequences.

''The Ouija Board'' (Paranormal Adventure Series Book 1) by Shelby White centers on a group of friends who unintentionally release evil through their use of a Ouija board, as does ''The Harrowing'' by Alexandra Sokoloff.

In ''For What It’s Worth'' by [[Janet Tashjian]] a boy uses a Ouija board to contact the spirits of [[Janis Joplin]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], and [[Jim Morrison]].

Issue #79 of ''Bart Simpson'', a  [[comic book]] series based on [[The Simpsons]], contains a story called "The Demon" in which Bart and Lisa find a Ouija board and unleash a demon. Issue #10 of ''Bart Simpson's Treehouse of horror'' contains the story "Scareway to Heaven" in which a Ouija board results in demon possession.

''The Invisible Histories of the Spiral Mountain; or The Hymns of Melchizedek,'' an occult novel by [[Christopher of Detroit]], contains several chapter that use the talking board for communication with the protagonist's higher self.

===Movies===
''[[The Uninvited (1944 film)|The Uninvited]],'' made in 1944, features a scene with an impromptu board the characters put together.  The 1973 blockbuster film, ''[[The Exorcist]]'', also uses a ouija board to explain why the young girl becomes possessed. ''[[Alison's Birthday]]'' has one too, with its claustrophobia-inducing filming, as do the films ''[[Deadly Messages]]'' and ''[[Awakenings]].'' 

The earliest Western film to hinge its ''entire'' plot around the (mis)use of a Ouija board, ''[[Witchboard]]'' (1986), makes a nod to ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (where there is a sequence in which a board is used), with a main character called Linda, and her partner quipping "So what you're telling me is... that I'm living with Linda Blair?"  ''Witchboard'' was so successful it spawned two sequels: ''[[Witchboard 2: The Devil's Doorway]]'', and ''[[Witchboard III: The Possession]]''.  In the same year as the first of the trilogy, the film ''Spookies'' also had its own Ouija board scene.

''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' (2000) also includes a [[séance]] scene with a board. ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' (2007) involves a violent entity haunting a couple that becomes more powerful when the Ouija board is used. Another 2007 film, ''[[Ouija (2007 film)|Ouija]]'', depicted a group of adolescents whose use of the board causes a murderous spirit to follow them, while four years later, ''The Ouija Experiment'' portrayed a group of friends whose use of the board opens, and fails to close, a portal between the worlds of the living and the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phase4films.com/Details.aspx?projectId=f38a1070-3e46-e311-bba7-d4ae527c3b65 |title=THE OUIJA EXPERIMENT |date=n.d. |accessdate=23 September 2015|website=PHASE 4 FILMS |publisher=Phase 4 Films Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 film ''[[Ouija (2014 film)|Ouija]]'' featured a group of friends whose use of the board prompted a series of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Rotten Tomatoes |title=The Ouija Experiment (2014) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ouija_2014/}}&lt;/ref&gt; That film was followed by a 2016 prequel, ''[[Ouija: Origin of Evil]]'', which also features the device.

[[I Am Zozo]]  follows a group of people that run afoul of a demon (based on [[Pazuzu]]) after using a [[Ouija board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hallam|first=Scott|title=Teaser Trailer Arrives for Ouija Thriller I Am ZoZo|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47759/teaser-trailer-arrives-ouija-thriller-i-am-zozo|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In season 1 episode 5 of ''[[The West Wing]]'', the Ouija  boards are mentioned by two characters who compare having a Ouija board to believing in [[UFO]]s.

In Season 3 Episode 8 of the TV series ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]]'', Barbra Jean and Reba use an Ouija Board to try and clean Barbra Jean and Brock’s house after Reba convinced her that the house was haunted. While holding the séance Reba pretended to be a ghost causing Barbra Jean to scream and run up stairs. The electric then goes out and Barbra Jean screams once again. At the end of the episode Barbra Jean asked Reba if they should ask the board if Brock was being a good husband in Vegas and the planchette moved. Reba then jumped across the table into Barbra Jean’s arms.

The National Geographic show [[Brain Games (National Geographic)|Brain Games]] Season 5 episode "Paranormal" clearly showed the board did not work when all participants were blindfolded.&lt;ref&gt;http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/brain-games/videos/do-you-believe/&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''Paraguayan National Anthem'''" ({{lang-es|Himno Nacional Paraguayo}}), also known alternatively by its chorus's [[incipit]] "'''Paraguayans, Republic or Death'''" ({{lang-en|Paraguayos, República o Muerte}}), is the [[national anthem]] of [[Paraguay]]. The lyrics were written by [[Francisco Acuña de Figueroa]] (who also wrote [[Orientales, la Patria o la tumba]], the national anthem of [[Uruguay]]) under the presidency of [[Carlos Antonio López]], who at the time delegated Bernardo Jovellanos and Anastasio González to ask Figueroa to write the anthem (Jovellanos and González were commissioners of the Paraguayan government in Uruguay).

==History==
The lyrics to the song were officially finished by Francisco Acuña de Figueroa on May 20, 1846.

It still remains unclear who was responsible for the creation of the music. Some sources claim that Frenchman [[Francisco Sauvageot de Dupuis]] was the composer, while others claim it to be the work of the Hungarian-born [[Francisco José Debali]] (Debály Ferenc József), who composed the melody of the [[National Anthem of Uruguay|Uruguayan national anthem]].&lt;ref&gt;''Himno nacional de Paraguay: su letra y su música (Encuesta del Instituto Paraguayo)'', cited in [http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/suplementos/escolar/francisco-sauvageot-de-dupuis-y-el-himno-nacional-590701.html ''Francisco Sauvageot de Dupuis y el Himno Nacional'' (in Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt; What it is known for sure is that it was the Paraguayan composer [[Remberto Giménez]] who in 1933 arranged and developed the version of the national anthem which remains in use by Paraguay today.

Though the national anthem has many verses, usually only the first verse followed by the chorus are sung on most occasions. Due to the song's length, the wordless introductory section and the latter half of the first verse are often omitted for brevity when the national anthem is played before a sporting event such as a soccer game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AApn8tp28Ds|title=Argentina Vs Paraguay (Copa América 2015) Himnos - National Anthems|first=|last=Heronumberone|date=18 June 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Posi music''' (pronounced pah-zee) has been around since the 1940s,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} though only recently has a definitive label been applied to music in this [[genre]]. Short for positive music, posi music is categorized by its intention to have a positive effect on the listener. Musicians who write and perform posi music profess a desire for their music to unite and inspire their audience and make them feel better.
An example is "[[Accentuate The Positive]]" written by [[Johnny Mercer]] and made famous by [[Bing Crosby]].  The song defined the concept that there is polarity between being positive or being negative, specifically noting there is also no neutral as in "no more Mr. In-Between".

This concept has been expanded by groups promoting the education of posi music, such as the [http://positivemusicassociation.com Positive Music Association], [http://empowerma.com emPower Music and Arts] and the [http://positiveimperative.com/?page_id=20 Positive Music Imperative].  This concept of Positive Music and Negative music has also been identified in the book called [[A New Earth]], by [[Eckhart Tolle]]

[[File:PosiAwards2012.JPG|thumb|A sing-a-long at the 2012 Posi Awards in Orlando, Fl]]

== Origins ==

Early posi music certainly had some roots in traditional folk music, in the genre labeled protest music.  While much of protest music would not fit into the simple definition of posi music, a subjective opinion could easily include songs like  "We Shall Overcome" by [[Pete Seeger]] or "If I Had A Hammer" performed by [[Peter Paul &amp; Mary]].

Deeper roots were nourished by [[New Thought]] musicians and posi music finally emerged as a fully defined concept when pioneers of the genre, Karl Anthony, Shanti Norman, Charley Thweatt, and Leroy White created music that was not focused on theology, but instead on more inclusive themes. Unlike [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[contemporary worship music]], posi music's lyrics are less specifically spiritual. By focusing on the human spirit and world community, Posi music embraces musicians from any religion. As the genre has evolved, it has been adopted by artists following many different spiritual paths ranging from [[New Thought]], [[Agapism]], [[Judaism]], [[Christian Science]] and [[Catholicism]] to [[Buddhism]], [[Pantheism]] and [[Seicho-no-Ie]].

Increasingly, there are groups of posi music artists who are dedicating most, if not all, of their music specifically to uplifting or motivational topics. As favor for the genre has grown, entire record labels have been dedicated to publication of posi music.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} As always, a selection of mainstream pop music would also fit into the genre of posi music, touching on major themes such as friendship and gratitude. Examples would be the hit songs "[[You've Got A Friend]]" by [[James Taylor]], "[[Bridge Over Troubled Water]]" by [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], and "[[Thank You For Being A Friend]]" by [[Andrew Gold]]. Of course, countless others would fit the bill; gratitude songs could once again go all the way back to [[Bob Hope]]'s "[[Thanks for the Memory]]," right up to songs simply entitled "Thank You" by [[Dido (singer)|Dido]] or [[Natalie Merchant]].

== Style ==

Posi music is described as being upbeat and uplifting music. Usually it centers around the [[lyrics]] rather than the music itself. Often it is affirmational, though sometimes it is a call directing the listener to make changes to how they live. Posi music can be spiritual, but it is not specifically religious in nature. This is by design, as posi music is meant to be enjoyed by people of all faiths.

== Uses ==

Posi music can be used in many settings beyond spiritual communities. Posi music is marketed for use in retreats, workshops, fitness centers, counseling centers, therapy, [[nursing home]]s and hospitals. The themes in posi music are ideal for programs such as Arts in Medicine, where music is used to promote [[healing]].

Uses of posi music have expanded to include motivational music for work-outs and companies like Amway have used motivational music to inspire their distributors.  In 2008 [[Barack Obama]] used posi music in his Yes We Can campaign by enlisting artist support like [[India.Arie]] with songs like "There's Hope" and "I Gotta Feeling" by [[The Black Eyed Peas]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8459">In [[probability theory]], '''Proebsting's paradox''' is an argument that appears to show that the [[Kelly criterion]] can lead to ruin. Although it can be resolved mathematically, it raises some interesting issues about the practical application of Kelly, especially in investing. It was named and first discussed by [[Edward O. Thorp]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="Wilmott II"&gt;E. O. Thorp, &lt;cite&gt;Understanding the Kelly Criterion: Part II&lt;/cite&gt;, Wilmott Magazine, September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox was named for [[Todd Proebsting]], its creator.

== Statement of the paradox ==
If a bet is equally likely to win or lose, and pays b times the stake for a win, the Kelly bet is:

: &lt;math&gt; f^{*} = \frac{b - 1}{2b}  \! &lt;/math&gt;

times wealth.&lt;ref name="original Kelly article"&gt;J. L. Kelly, Jr, &lt;cite&gt;A New Interpretation of Information Rate&lt;/cite&gt;, Bell System Technical Journal, 35, (1956), 917&amp;ndash;926&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a 50/50 bet pays 2 to 1, Kelly says to bet 25% of wealth. If a 50/50 bet pays 5 to 1, Kelly says to bet 40% of wealth.

Now suppose a gambler is offered 2 to 1 payout and bets 25%. What should he do if the payout on new bets changes to 5 to 1? He should choose ''f''* to maximize:

: &lt;math&gt; 0.5 \ln(1.5 + 5f^{*}) + 0.5 \ln(0.75 - f^{*}) \! &lt;/math&gt;

because if he wins he will have 1.5 (the 0.5 from winning the 25% bet at 2 to 1 odds) plus 5''f''*; and if he loses he must pay 0.25 from the first bet, and ''f''* from the second. Taking the derivative with respect to ''f''* and setting it to zero gives:

: &lt;math&gt; 5(0.75 - f^{*}) = 1.5 + 5f^{*} \! &lt;/math&gt;

which can be rewritten:

: &lt;math&gt; 2.25 = 10f^{*} \!&lt;/math&gt;

So ''f''* = 0.225.

The paradox is that the total bet, 0.25 + 0.225 = 0.475, is larger than the 0.4 Kelly bet if the 5 to 1 odds are offered from the beginning. It is counterintuitive that you bet more when some of the bet is at unfavorable odds. Todd Proebsting emailed [[Edward O. Thorp|Ed Thorp]] asking about this.

Ed Thorp realized the idea could be extended to give the Kelly bettor a nonzero probability of being ruined. He showed that if a gambler is offered 2 to 1 odds, then 4 to 1, then 8 to 1 and so on (2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to 1 for ''n'' = 1 to infinity) Kelly says to bet:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{3^{n - 1}}{4^n} \! &lt;/math&gt;

each time. The sum of all these bets is 1. So a Kelly gambler has a 50% chance of losing his entire wealth.

In general, if a bettor makes the Kelly bet on a 50/50 proposition with a payout of b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and then is offered b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, he will bet a total of:

: &lt;math&gt; f^{*} = \frac{b_2 - 1}{2b_2} + \frac{b_1 - 1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{f_1} - \frac{1}{f_2}\right). \! &lt;/math&gt;

The first term is what the bettor would bet if offered b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; initially. The second term is positive if f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, meaning that if the payout improves, the Kelly bettor will bet more than he would if just offered the second payout, while if the payout gets worse he will bet less than he would if offered only the second payout.

== Practical application ==

Many bets have the feature that payoffs and probabilities can change before the outcome is determined. In sports betting for example, the line may change several times before the event is held, and news may come out (such as an injury or weather forecast) that changes the probability of an outcome. In investing, a stock originally bought at $20 per share might be available now at $10 or $30 or any other price. Some sports bettors try to make income from anticipating line changes rather than predicting event outcomes. Some traders concentrate on possible short-term price movements of a security rather than its long-term fundamental prospects.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Asset and Liability Management"&gt;S.A. Zenios and W.T. Ziemba, &lt;cite&gt;Handbook of Asset and Liability Management&lt;/cite&gt;, North Holland (2006), {{isbn|978-0-444-50875-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic investing example is a trader who has exposure limits, say he is not allowed to have more than $1 million at risk in any one stock. That doesn't mean he cannot lose more than $1 million. If he buys $1 million of the stock at $20 and it goes to $10, he can buy another $500,000. If it then goes to $5, he can buy another $500,000. If it goes to zero , he can lose an infinite amount of money, despite never having more than $1 million at risk.&lt;ref name="The Dhandho Investor"&gt;Mohnish Pabrai, &lt;cite&gt;The Dhandho Investor: The Low - Risk Value Method to High Returns&lt;/cite&gt;, Wiley (2007), {{isbn|978-0-470-04389-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resolution ==

There is no paradox. Kelly's criterion is to maximise expected rate of growth; only under restricted conditions does it correspond to maximising the log. One easy way to dismiss the paradox is to note that Kelly assumes that probabilities do not change.

A Kelly bettor who knows odds might change could factor this into a more complex Kelly bet. For example suppose a Kelly bettor is given a one-time opportunity to bet a 50/50 proposition at [[odds]] of 2 to 1. He knows there is a 50% chance that a second one-time opportunity will be offered at 5 to 1. Now he should maximize:

: &lt;math&gt; 0.25 \ln(1 + 2f_1) + 0.25 \ln(1 - f_1) + 0.25 \ln(1 + 2f_1 + 5f_2) + 0.25 \ln(1 - f_1 - f_2) \! &lt;/math&gt;

with respect to both ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The answer turns out to be bet zero at 2 to 1, and wait for the chance of betting at 5 to 1, in which case you bet 40% of wealth. If the probability of being offered 5 to 1 odds is less than 50%, some amount between zero and 25% will be bet at 2 to 1. If the probability of being offered 5 to 1 odds is more than 50%, the Kelly bettor will actually make a negative bet at 2 to 1 odds (that is, bet on the 50/50 outcome with payout of 1/2 if he wins and paying 1 if he loses). In either case, his bet at 5 to 1 odds, if the opportunity is offered, is 40% minus 0.7 times his 2 to 1 bet.

What the paradox says, essentially, is that if a Kelly bettor has incorrect beliefs about what future bets may be offered, he can make suboptimal choices, and even go broke. The Kelly criterion is supposed to do better than any essentially different strategy in the long run and have zero chance of ruin, as long as the bettor knows the probabilities and payouts.&lt;ref name="original Kelly article"/&gt; 

More light on the issues was shed by an independent consideration of the problem by [[Aaron Brown (financial author)|Aaron Brown]], also communicated to [[Edward O. Thorp|Ed Thorp]] by email. In this formulation, the assumption is the bettor first sells back the initial bet, then makes a new bet at the second payout. In this case his total bet is:

: &lt;math&gt; f^{*} = \frac{b_2 - 1}{2b_2} - \frac{b_1 - 1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{f_1} - \frac{1}{f_2}\right)\frac{f_2-1}{f_2+1} \! &lt;/math&gt;

which looks very similar to the formula above for the Proebsting formulation, except that the sign is reversed on the second term and it is multiplied by an additional term.

For example, given the original example of a 2 to 1 payout followed by a 5 to 1 payout, in this formulation the bettor first bets 25% of wealth at 2 to 1. When the 5 to 1 payout is offered, the bettor can sell back the original bet for a loss of 0.125. His 2 to 1 bet pays 0.5 if he wins and costs 0.25 if he loses. At the new 5 to 1 payout, he could get a bet that pays 0.625 if he wins and costs 0.125 if he loses, this is 0.125 better than his original bet in both states. Therefore his original bet now has a value of -0.125. Given his new wealth level of 0.875, his 40% bet (the Kelly amount for the 5 to 1 payout) is 0.35.

The two formulations are equivalent. In the original formulation, the bettor has 0.25 bet at 2 to 1 and 0.225 bet at 5 to 1. If he wins, he gets 2.625 and if he loses he has 0.525. In the second formulation, the bettor has 0.875 and 0.35 bet at 5 to 1. If he wins, he gets 2.625 and if he loses he has 0.525.

The second formulation makes clear that the change in behavior results from the mark-to-market loss the investor experiences when the new payout is offered. This is a natural way to think in finance, less natural to a gambler. In this interpretation, the infinite series of doubling payouts does not ruin the Kelly bettor by enticing him to overbet, it extracts all his wealth through changes beyond his control.

'''Radio jamming on the Korean Peninsula''' makes the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|border region]] one of the world's busiest places for radio signals. [[Medium wave]] jamming is dominant in the area including [[Seoul]] and the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ). South Korea jams all radio and television broadcasts from North Korea, and until 2013 jammed all foreign broadcasts, which was ended during the [[Park Geun-hye]] administration.

North Korea jams South Korean state broadcasts and foreign [[shortwave]] broadcast services which it believes to be against the North Korean regime. These include the [[Korean language]] service of the [[Voice of America]], [[Free North Korea Radio]] (which originates from US transmitters in [[Guam]]), [[Radio Free Asia]], and several other services and broadcasts.

==Radio jamming in South Korea==

The [[South Korean government]] constantly jams most radio broadcasts from North Korea on medium-wave. According to the [[National Security Act (South Korea)|National Security Act]] in South Korea, it is illegal to tune into or publish frequencies of North Korean broadcasts. Yet an ordinary South Korean citizen cannot be easily punished for merely listening to those broadcasts in private. However, public listening and distribution of recordings of an anti-government organisation, namely North Korea, are criminal offences. A listener in the Seoul Metropolitan area ([[Seoul]], [[Incheon]], and [[Gyeonggi Province]]) or near the DMZ who tunes across the MW band may hear strange signals on several MW frequencies, mixing with North Korean radio broadcasts. These include 657&amp;nbsp;kHz ([[Pyongyang Broadcasting station|PBS]] [[Pyongyang]]), 720&amp;nbsp;kHz (KCBS [[Wiwon]]), 819&amp;nbsp;kHz ([[Korean Central Broadcasting Station|KCBS]] Pyongyang), 882&amp;nbsp;kHz and 1080&amp;nbsp;kHz (KCBS [[Haeju]]).

The South Korean government broadcasts several bizarre-sounding jamming sounds (usually warbling or chugging)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ug6bnhjy7o
| title = Radio wars between North and South Korea
| accessdate = 2010-06-10
| publisher = Network World
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to prevent their citizens from hearing radio broadcasts from the North. The medium-wave jamming by the South is sometimes too weak to completely block the North Korean broadcasts (the jamming transmission power seems to be between 20 and 50 [[kilowatt]]s, while the targeted North Korean transmissions are of much higher transmission power—typically over 500 kilowatts). Using a decent quality radio, a listener can sometimes nullify the South Korean jammer by re-orienting the set so its ferrite antenna points in a different direction.   On [[shortwave]], jamming is not as severe; only a very few North Korean frequencies are slightly jammed. FM jamming is also carried out and it is highly effective in Seoul.

Television jamming in South Korea was widespread before the introduction of [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting]] (DMB) in South Korea. In Seoul, one could see [[SMPTE color bars|colour bars]] on particular channels of the [[Very high frequency|VHF band]] used by (North) [[Korean Central Television]]. Now jamming with random signals on those channels is not done, but the channels are used for DMB broadcasting.  The digital broadcasts provide reliable portable digital television multimedia broadcasts, but cause severe interference with the North Korean analogue signals.

==Radio jamming in North Korea==
It is illegal for North Koreans to listen to anything other than [[Media of North Korea|state-run radio]] and all radios sold by state shops in North Korea are fix-tuned to government frequencies, though radios capable of receiving foreign broadcasts can be bought on the black market.&lt;ref name="Susan Chun"&gt;{{cite news

| publisher=  [[CNN]]

| accessdate= August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  North Korea does not jam any commercial South Korean television or radio broadcasts (such as [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] or [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]]). However North Korea does jam some of South Korea's state-owned radio and television broadcasts (namely [[KBS1]] Ch. 9 [[KBS2]] Ch.7 [[KBS Radio 1]] 711&amp;nbsp;kHz and 97.3&amp;nbsp;MHz, [[KBS 1FM]] 93.1&amp;nbsp;MHz, [[KBS Radio 2]] 603&amp;nbsp;kHz/106.1&amp;nbsp;MHz, [[KBS 2FM]] 89.1&amp;nbsp;MHz [[KBS Radio 3]] 1134&amp;nbsp;kHz/104.9&amp;nbsp;MHz, KBS Radio Social Education 6,015&amp;nbsp;kHz and Korean Forces Network 96.7&amp;nbsp;MHz). Before the (early 2007) closure of South Korean shortwave domestic radio broadcasts (which were often targeted at the North) 3930&amp;nbsp;kHz  [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] Radio 1 and 6015 and 6135&amp;nbsp;kHz [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] Radio Korean Ethnicity (formerly KBS Radio Social Education) had been severely jammed by the North.

The type of the jamming on shortwave is "Jet Plane Noise", which makes it very hard to hear the radio broadcasts. North Korea also jams South Korea's clandestine shortwave broadcast, [[Echo of Hope]], and the South Korean international shortwave broadcasts of [[KBS World Radio]] on 5975&amp;nbsp;kHz (discontinued as of early 2007) and 7275&amp;nbsp;kHz. The South Korean national radio channel, [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] Radio 1 on 711&amp;nbsp;kHz medium-wave is also jammed by the North. Before the bilateral declaration in 2000, KBS Radio 1 used to deliver certain programmes (merged with then KBS Radio Social Education) which condemned the North Korean regime at midnight. A visitor to coastal areas of the [[Yellow Sea]] (covering coastal parts of Gyeonggi Province, Incheon, Chungcheong, and sometimes Jeolla regions) who tunes into 711&amp;nbsp;kHz ([[KBS Radio 1]] Seoul) may hear strange beeping sounds, which seem to be jamming signals from the North.

The North does not usually jam the [[medium-wave]] transmissions of South Korea's broadcast towards the North, KBS [[Radio Korean Ethnicity]] (formerly KBS Radio Liberty Social Education) on 972 and 1170&amp;nbsp;kHz. KBS Radio Korean Ethnicity no longer targets North Koreans since the [[June 15th North-South Joint Declaration|North-South Korea Joint Declaration]] on 15 June 2000. As of 15 August 2007, the radio channel has changed to a special radio broadcast for  the [[Russian Far East]] and [[Northeast China]], where nearly three million [[Koreans in China]] and several hundred thousand [[Koryo-saram]] (ethnic Koreans in [[Central Asia]]) live.

North Korean jamming of television is relatively unusual, although the North Korean regime once severely jammed a South Korean state-owned television broadcast ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] 1TV on [[VHF]] ch. 9 in Seoul) in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;중앙일보 1975년 11월 25일자 1면 기사 (from an article on the page 1, 25 November 1975, [[Joongang Ilbo]])&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there used to be some strange signals on VHF ch. 9 ([[KBS1]]) as well as VHF ch. 7 ([[KBS2]]) in Seoul which may be North Korean jamming; the two analogue TV channels were discontinued as of 31 December 2012. This jamming is not very effective.

Due to electricity shortages in North Korea, radio jamming activities are not consistent and are sometimes interrupted by power failures.&lt;ref&gt;http://jammingwatch.blogspot.com/2008_12_01_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A group by the name of '''[[Free North Korea Radio]]''' conducts numerous activities that focus on providing radio broadcasts to North Koreans. The broadcasts often include instructions on methods to leave the country and the group has contact with underground reporters within North Korea. The group primarily consists of numerous [[North Korean defectors|North Korean refugees and defectors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Melanie Kirkpatrick |title=Escape from North Korea: The Untold Story of Asia's Underground Railroad |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMizWCJ6hTYC&amp;pg=PA286 |year=2012 |publisher=Encounter Books |isbn=978-1-59403-646-0 |pages=286–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karin Deutsch Karlekar |author2=Sarah Gibbard Cook |title=Freedom of the Press 2008: A Global Survey of Media Independence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEKw8ZIUbh8C&amp;pg=PA250 |year=2009 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-6309-4 |pages=250–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late September 2017, the [[BBC World Service]] launched shortwave broadcasts in [[Korean language|Korean]] aimed at the [[Korean Peninsula]] from its transmitters in [[Taiwan]] and [[Tashkent]], which North Korea quickly began jamming.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/27/north-korea-aggressively-jamming-new-bbc-broadcasts/ North Korea 'aggressively' jamming BBC's new Korean-language service] ''The Telegraph'', September 27, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sakara music''' is a form of popular [[Nigeria]]n music based in the traditions of [[Yoruba music]].
It is a Moslem-influenced style, mostly in the form of praise songs, that uses only traditional Yoruba instruments such as the solemn-sounding [[goje]] violin, and the small round [[sakara drum]], which is similar to a tambourine and is beaten with a stick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

One of the first performers of this type of music in [[Lagos]] was [[Abibu Oluwa]], who started playing in the 1930s. On his death in 1964 his place in the band was taken by Salami Alabi (Lefty) Balogun (October 1913 - 29 December 1981), a [[talking drum]]mer, who released over 35 records.
Other members of the band included Baba Mukaila, and [[Yusuf Olatunji|Joseph (Yussuf) Olatunju]].&lt;ref name=kash&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myrhythm.com/kash_xi.htm |title=Azeez Ojutiku - Bio |publisher=MyRhythm.com |accessdate=2010-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121013406/http://myrhythm.com/kash_xi.htm |archivedate=January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Yusuf Olatunji (alias Baba l’Egba), who died in 1978, did much to popularize the musical genre and released many records on the Phillips Nigeria label. A street in [[Abeokuta]] is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Sakara music had considerable influence on other genres, including [[Jùjú music|Jùjú]] and [[African hip hop#Nigeria|Nigerian Hip Hop]].&lt;ref name=kash/&gt;

'''Dancing tradition in Serbia''' is represented by various styles of [[dance]]s in the country. As with other aspects of [[Serbian culture]], different forms of dances originated in different parts of [[Serbia]], developed according to the local traditions and also acquired elements from other parts of the country.

Serbian folk dancing, '''''[[kolo (dance)|kolo]]''''' ("circle [dance]"), includes many varieties. The most popular dances are ''Užičko kolo'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ursula Hemetek|author2=Adelaida Reyes|author3=Institut für Volksmusikforschung und Ethnomusikologie--Wien|title=Cultural diversity in the urban area: explorations in urban ethnomusicology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=US4JAQAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Institut für Volksmusikforschung und Ethnomusikologie|isbn=978-3-902153-03-6|quote=They played newly composed folk music as well as kolos such as Uzicko kolo, a very popular dance melody from Serbia.

'''''Shift 2: Unleashed''''' (also known as '''''Need for Speed: Shift 2 – Unleashed''''') is a [[racing game|racing]] [[video game]], and part of the ''[[Need for Speed]]'' series. It is the seventeenth installment in the long-running ''[[Need for Speed]]'' series. It was developed by [[Slightly Mad Studios]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. The game serves as a direct sequel to ''[[Need for Speed: Shift]]'' and expands on many aspects that were introduced in the original.&lt;ref name="announcement"&gt;{{cite press release |title=EA's Engine Roar with Shift 2 Unleashed |url=http://www.ea.com/news/ea-engine-roar-with-shift-2-unleashed |publisher=[[Electronic Arts]] |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2010-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="financial-report"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Electronic Arts Reports Q1 FY11 Financial Result |url=http://investor.ea.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=496057 |publisher=[[Electronic Arts]] |date=2010-08-03 |accessdate=2010-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shift 2: Unleashed'' was released worldwide during March and April 2011,&lt;ref name="S2U-release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.needforspeed.com/post/shift-2-unleashed%E2%84%A2-launch-date-announced |title=SHIFT 2 UNLEASHED Launch Date Announced |date=January 13, 2011 |accessdate= January 14, 2011 |publisher=Needforspeed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eu-release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igarchive.com/news/?a=136850&amp;n=Shift+2%3A+Unleashed+release+date+slips+a+week |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003171434/http://www.igarchive.com/news/?a=136850&amp;n=Shift+2:+Unleashed+release+date+slips+a+week |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |title=Shift 2: Unleashed release date slips a week |date=February 18, 2011 |accessdate= March 26, 2011 |publisher=CVG}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was not released in Japan.

==Gameplay==
{{See also|Need for Speed: Shift#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay in Need for Speed: Shift}}

''Shift 2'' claims to redefine the racing simulator genre by delivering authentic and true-to-life dynamic crash physics, intricately detailed real-world cars, drivers and tracks.&lt;ref name="S2U-fl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/NFS-Shift-2-Unleashed-Feature-List-and-Career-Trailer-Revealed-181110.shtml |title=NFS: Shift 2 Unleashed Feature List and Career Trailer Revealed |date=January 28, 2011 |accessdate=February 28, 2011 |publisher=Softpedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their careers, virtual racers partake in a variety of motorsports — like drifting, muscle car racing, retro car racing, Endurance races and circuit competition (i.e. FIA GT3 European Championship) — to hone their driving skills in hopes of becoming the FIA GT1 world champion.&lt;ref name="S2U-career"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wot.motortrend.com/first-play-ea-shows-need-speed-shift-2-unleashed-all-about-36537.html |title=First Play: EA Shows Us What Need For Speed Shift 2 Unleashed is All About |date=March 4, 2011 |accessdate=March 7, 2011 |publisher=MotorTrend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the career mode, [[Vaughn Gittin]], a [[Formula D]] Champion guides the player through his career, customizing the car, Autolog, teaching the player how to drift, so the player would head on to the [[FIA GT3]] and the Works series. Then, he begins to move on to the [[FIA GT1 Championship]]. Gittin also explains the Muscle discipline. The career mode also features the Formula D driver [[Darren McNamara]], who explains the Retro discipline, [[Chris Rado]], who explains Time Attack and Drag Racing (DLC) discipline, Eric and Marc Kozeluh, who explains Standing Mile (DLC) discipline, [[Mad Mike Whiddett]], who explains the Works discipline, Executive Vice President of [[Electronic Arts|EA]] Patrick Söderlund, who explains the FIA GT3 discipline, [[Tommy Milner]], who explains the endurance discipline, Matt Powers, who explains the Legends (DLC) discipline, and [[Jamie Campbell-Walter]], who explains the FIA GT1 discipline.

As well as an in-car camera view, ''Shift 2'' includes a 'helmet-camera' in which the player's viewpoint is from their driver. The helmet cam moves with the head of the driver, being drawn from side to side as the car takes corners and jerking forward when the player crashes. As the car comes up to higher speeds, the edges of the screen will become blurred to simulate the tunnel-vision effect that drivers suffer when racing.&lt;ref name="S2U-nd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/01/28/new-need-for-speed-shift-2-details-screens-and-trailer/ |title=New Need for Speed: Shift 2 details, screens and trailer |date=January 28, 2011 |accessdate=February 18, 2011 |publisher=PCGamer}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shift 2'''s night racing also appears to be more advanced, with headlights dimming or turning off completely if damaged, further narrowing the player's view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/previews/218546/pax-east-shift-2-unleashed-preview/ |title=PAX East: Shift 2: Unleashed Preview |date=March 17, 2011 |accessdate=March 22, 2011 |publisher=GamePro|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/previews/218546/pax-east-shift-2-unleashed-preview/&amp;date=2011-11-30+22:18:52|archivedate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Autolog system is now 'Need for Speed DNA'. The system appears in ''Shift 2'' in a more-or-less identical design to the original, but includes extra features that they not only provide track times for unique events, but also segregate data based on quick race tracks, race types and automotive disciplines. This essentially means that Autolog is more than just a system that simply displays player friend’s times regardless of how, or when, they set them during their career.&lt;ref name="S2U-nd"/&gt;

''Shift 2'' features more than 140 licensed vehicles available for racing and tuning, a smaller number compared with racing sims such as ''[[Forza Motorsport 4]]'', and the 1200 cars found in ''[[Gran Turismo 6]]''. However, executive producer Marcus Nilsson said the studio wanted to concentrate on having only the must-have speedsters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2011/02/behind-the-wheel-of-shift-2-unleashed/1 |title=Behind the wheel of 'Shift 2 Unleashed' |date=February 28, 2011 |accessdate=March 1, 2011 |publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/289755/news/shift-2-unleashed-gets-exclusive-next-gen-supercar-trailer/ |title=Shift 2: Unleashed gets exclusive 'next gen supercar' - trailer |date=2011-02-18 |accessdate=2011-02-19 |publisher=CVG}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also 40 real-world locations including [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Bathurst]], [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] and [[Suzuka Circuit|Suzuka]] as well as fictional circuits like downtown [[London]] and [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name="S2U-fl"/&gt;

Lead designer Andy Tutor confirmed that ''Shift 2'' doesn't feature split-screen, saying, "There’s so much going on in the game, for example we’ve added if you’re drafting a guy now you’ll get all the little bits of crap from his car, all the gravel and rubber hit the car and they can hit your windscreen and things like that. It takes a lot of development time but it’s very authentic and that’s the experience we want. Unfortunately that means things like split-screen aren’t possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thatvideogameblog.com/2010/11/30/interview-shift-2-unleashed-lead-designer-andy-tutor/ |title=Interview / Shift 2 Unleashed lead designer Andy Tutor |date=2010-11-30 |accessdate=2011-03-09 |publisher=That Videogame Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In early July 2010 it was rumored that a sequel for ''Shift'' was in development, called "''Need for Speed: Shift 2''" and to be developed by [[Slightly Mad Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bigdownload.com/2010/07/01/rumor-more-need-for-speed-shift-coming/ |title=Rumor: Need For Speed Shift 2 coming? |publisher=News.bigdownload.com |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, [[EA]] said another ''[[Need for Speed]]'' game will be released at some point during its fourth quarter (1 January through 31 March 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wesley Yin-Poole |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/nfs-shift-2-in-the-works |title=Need for Speed: SHIFT 2 in the works? |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rumors started when Chris McClure, who left Slightly Mad Studios for CCP, updated his profile on professional networking site Linkedin to include the work he had been doing prior to his departure. His CV read: "Mostly worked on new [[Need for Speed: World|open world technology]] but also worked on Need For Speed Shift 2."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Aiton |first=Ewan |url=http://play.tm/news/30884/cv-outs-need-for-speed-shift-2/ |title=CV outs Need for Speed Shift 2 |publisher=Play.tm |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127202858/http://play.tm/news/30884/cv-outs-need-for-speed-shift-2/ |archivedate=2010-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/Need-for-Speed-Shift-2-Unannounced/news/Need-For-Speed-Shift-2-Mooted-15428.html |title=Need For Speed Shift 2 Mooted News |publisher=Totalvideogames.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308095009/http://www.totalvideogames.com/Need-for-Speed-Shift-2-Unannounced/news/Need-For-Speed-Shift-2-Mooted-15428.html |archivedate=2012-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shift 2'' was confirmed when EA listed the game in their first quarter financial report as a Q4 2011 title (i.e. Q1 2011 in calendar year) for consoles and PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/deadspace2/news.html?sid=6272151 |title=Crysis 2 delayed, Need for Speed Shift 2 announced |author=Brendan Sinclair |date=2010-08-03 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2010-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was officially announced as ''Shift 2: Unleashed'' on 16 November 2010 with a teaser trailer, the same day as ''[[Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit (2010 video game)|Hot Pursuit]]'' was released in the US . ''Shift 2'' brings an "all-new" rendering engine and a "massive" graphics overhaul. "With an innovative helmet camera view simulating the physical experience of driving at 200mph, the thrilling experience of night racing and authentic degradation of tracks and cars, this is tomorrow's sim for today's adrenaline fuelled racer." said EA at the press time. ''Shift 2'' is redefining immersive racing by blending the rush of tearing up the track at unbelievable speeds with the emotional experience of competitive battle", said executive producer Marcus Nilsson. "We are also working closely with real-world performance drivers to ensure that ''Shift 2 Unleashed'' captures their experience and becomes the benchmark in authentic racing action." Two weeks before ''Shift 2'' was announced did EA executive Patrick Soderlund said, "We think we can compete and ultimately become market leading in the simulation authentic motorsport segment. One of the strongest points we have is, apart from the fact we have a very talented developer working with us and we now have an established brand underneath the ''NFS'' umbrella in that segment, we also have the advantage of being a multi-platform offering. [[Forza Motorsport 3|Forza]] can only be bought on Xbox and ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'' is only available on PlayStation. We're the only one right now that is of a significant weight that can offer something up on all those platforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wesley Yin-Poole |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-11-16-need-for-speed-shift-2-announced |title=Shift 2 Unleashed announced |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shift 2 Unleashed"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.needforspeed.com/post/shift-2-unleashed |title=Shift 2 Unleashed |date=2010-11-16 |publisher=[[Needforspeed.com]] |accessdate=2010-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus Nilsson, producer of the game, said that ''Shift 2'' won't match [[Forza Motorsport 3|Forza]]'s 60 frames per second performance, but indicated it will be a far more vibrant game as a result. "You have to make a choice with today's tech. Either you go for - and this is harsh but it's what I think - the bland graphics of [[Gran Turismo 5|GT]] and [[Forza Motorsport 3|Forza]], or you try to push the bar for what consoles can do." said Nilsson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=276019 |title=News: 'Bland' Gran Turismo, Forza graphics avoided by NFS: Shift 2 - dev |publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EA's Patrick Soderlund revealed that he believes ''Shift 2: Unleashed'' can outdo ''[[Gran Turismo 5]] '' when it comes to providing an "authentic driving experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerzines.com/ps3/news/shift-2-to-beat-gt5.html |title=EA: SHIFT 2 Unleashed will beat Gran Turismo 5 |author=Andy Griffiths |date=2010-11-23 |publisher=[[GamerZines]] |accessdate=2010-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506013412/http://www.gamerzines.com/ps3/news/shift-2-to-beat-gt5.html |archivedate=2011-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the lead designer and executive producer of ''Shift 2'' spoke out against ''GT5'', implying that it has way too many cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekoalition.com/need-for-speed-shift-2-team-takes-shots-at-gt5 |title=Need For Speed Shift 2 Team Takes Shots At GT5 |date= |publisher=[[The Koalition]] |accessdate=2010-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231082558/http://www.thekoalition.com/need-for-speed-shift-2-team-takes-shots-at-gt5 |archivedate=December 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Tudor, lead designer of the game, said that games like ''[[Gran Turismo 5]]'' and ''[[Forza Motorsport 3]]'', were more like encyclopedias than games, and featured hundreds of "irrelevant cars". Tudor said "You can add hundreds of cars to your game, but people will ignore most of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/105793-Shift-2-Unleashed-Dev-Attacks-Rivals-Over-Irrelevant-Cars |title=Shift 2: Unleashed Dev Attacks Rivals Over "Irrelevant" Cars |date=2010-12-02 |publisher=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |accessdate=2010-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lazygamer.net/nfs-shift-2-dev-rips-gt5-and-forza-a-new-one/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110817022528/http://www.lazygamer.net/nfs-shift-2-dev-rips-gt5-and-forza-a-new-one/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-08-17 |title=NFS: Shift 2 dev rips GT5 and Forza a new one |date=2010-12-01 |publisher=[[Lazygamer]] |accessdate=2010-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Need for Speed'' producer Jesse Abney thought that ''Shift 2: Unleashed'' will cross the racing divide to entice arcade fans as well as sim fans. Regarding the first ''Shift'', "‘accessible’ was used a lot, to the chagrin of simulation fans," the producer told NowGamer. "But you want those incremental steps to be a bit of a handholding exercise – ''Shift'' was developed as an acknowledgement that our fan base has grown up with us over 17 years. Their interests have changed. Some of them have grown up to become the race drivers we talk to today. They want that type of game. So we knew to acknowledge them and their interests, we really had to build an authentic racing game. And that’s what ''Shift'' was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopkins |first=Tom |url=http://www.nowgamer.com/news/5149/shift-2-for-arcade-and-sim-fans/ |title=Shift 2: 'For Arcade And Sim Fans' |publisher=Now Gamer |date=2011-02-08 |accessdate=2011-02-09 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead designer, Andy Tudor said ''Shift 2: Unleashed'' is injecting "emotional and social aspects" into the sequel, which take it beyond "being a numbers game". "The simulation genre, really, is just a numbers game at the moment; it’s all about, ‘We’ve got the greatest physics engine, and we’re going to add 1,000 cars, tracks etcetera.’ It’s quite a dry experience. We want to turn that on its head, by adding in social features, such as Autolog. I’ve gone on record before saying ''GT5'' and ''Forza'' are on pedestals at the moment: everyone believes they are the games to beat. They have great products, but they stop at being a numbers game, a mathematical simulation of great physics, whereas we go beyond that with the emotional and social aspects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strategyinformer.com/news/11209/slighty-mad-racing-sim-quite-dry-shift-2-turns-that-on-its-head |title=Slighty Mad: Racing sim 'quite dry', Shift 2 turns that "on its head" |date=2011-02-28 |accessdate=2011-03-01 |publisher=StrategyInformer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318022530/http://www.strategyinformer.com/news/11209/slighty-mad-racing-sim-quite-dry-shift-2-turns-that-on-its-head |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/feb/28/gamesblog-live-andy-tudor |title=Gamesblog Live: Need for Speed Shift 2's Andy Tudor on simulation versus emotion |date=2011-02-28 |accessdate=2011-03-01 |publisher=Guardian UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus Nilson said that Autolog has changes since ''Hot Pursuit'', "Yeah. You racing in the game becomes the fuel for other people to race, it's brilliant. Slightly Mad Studios has been working with [[Criterion Games|Criterion]] from really early on exchanging ideas and executing on the core tenants that Criterion came up with. We're implementing it slightly differently but integrating more into the core experience of what the game is. I don't want the game to feel like I have a career and then I can go online to compete with my friends, I want it to feel like one whole. Autolog really weaves everything together into one compelling package. If you race this game and you beat people on your friends list, that's going to give you more XP to propel you in your career."&lt;ref name="Interview-GZ" /&gt;

===Spin-off===
Marcus Nilsson, the executive producer of ''Shift 2: Unleashed'', said this about why they decide to drop the ''Need for Speed'' name for ''Shift 2'', "If you think about the ''Need for Speed'' games you've played; ''[[Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit (2010 video game)|Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit]]'', ''[[Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005 video game)|Most Wanted]]'', ''[[Need for Speed: Underground|Underground]]'', they're very arcadey and action-oriented. ''Shift'' is going after a different audience, a sim audience, and it's about driving cars the way they feel in real life. So to not confuse the consumer - don't take me wrong, ''Shift 2: Unleashed'' is still a ''Need for Speed'' game inside the ''Need for Speed'' family, but that family has different legs. ''Hot Pursuit'' fits the action games; ''Shift 2'' is sim-like."&lt;ref name="Interview-GZ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerzines.com/ps3/previews/shift-2-unleashed-interview.html |title=INTERVIEW: Shift 2: Unleashed |author=David Scammell |date=2010-12-02 |publisher=[[GamerZines]] |accessdate=2010-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226090859/http://www.gamerzines.com/ps3/previews/shift-2-unleashed-interview.html |archivedate=2010-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[EA]] wanted to establish ''Shift'' as a new franchise when ''Shift 2: Unleashed'' was released in March. The [[Need for Speed: Shift|original]] was part of the ''Need for Speed'' family, but the sequel branches out in order to win over simulation racer fans and compete with genre rival ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]''. {{cquote|“''Shift'' is still part of the ''Need for Speed'' family, but it offers a very different experience from our traditional ''Need for Speed'' action racers. With ''Shift 2: Unleashed'', we aim to redefine sim racing so that fans get as close to the feeling of real racing as possible. Sim racers are proving very popular with consumers – ''[[F1 2010 (video game)|F1 2010]]'' and ''[[Gran Turismo 5|GT5]]'' have done great numbers. The game will still embody the core values of ''Need for Speed'', but we want to establish ''Shift'' as our clearly defined simulation racer. Our ''Need for Speed'' strategy is to create the best racing and driving experiences for all racing fans. The use of ''Shift'' as a franchise name is reflective of our desire to establish it as the best simulation racer in the market with its own unique, distinct positioning.” EA’s racing and action business lead Colin Blackwood told MCV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Batchelor |first=James |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/42815/EAs-Shift-set-for-NFS-IP-spin-off |title=EA's Shift set for NFS IP spin-off |publisher=MCV |date=2011-02-01 |accessdate=2011-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206145614/http://www.mcvuk.com/news/42815/EAs-Shift-set-for-NFS-IP-spin-off |archivedate=2011-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Shift 2: Unleashed'' was met with generally positive reviews. Aggregating review website [[Metacritic]] gave the PC version 84/100,&lt;ref name=MCPC /&gt; the Xbox 360 version 82/100,&lt;ref name=MCX360 /&gt; the PlayStation 3 version 81/100.&lt;ref name=MCPS3 /&gt;

[[GameTrailers]] rated the game an 8.9/10, saying how it "Refines the strengths of the first game and extends their value indefinitely through the competitive environment of autolog. There aren't any breakthrough new features here, but this is a racer that will constantly push you to improve and make you sweat under the pressure."&lt;ref name="gametrailers.com"/&gt;

It gained an 8/10 rating from [[Eurogamer]], stating: "As an update to the previous SHIFT title, Unleashed is a significant draft forward. While the driving itself retains the boisterous character of its predecessor, there's been a considerable tightening of focus in the experience system, which makes every race feel meaningful whether you win or lose."&lt;ref name="eurogamer.net"/&gt;

It gained a 7.5/10 rating from [[GameSpot]], stating how "Shift 2 may not offer full-on simulation features, but it boasts roller-coaster thrills and a deep sense of immersion in the hectic world of racing."&lt;ref name="uk.gamespot.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18768">'''Tax Freedom Day''' is the first day of the year in which a [[nation]] as a whole has theoretically earned enough income to pay its taxes.  Every dollar that is officially considered income by the government is counted, and every payment to the government that is officially considered a tax is counted. Taxes at all levels of government – local, state and federal – are included.

==Purpose==
According to Neil Veldhuis, Director of Fiscal Studies, Fraser Institute, the purpose of Tax Freedom Day is to provide citizens of tax-paying countries with a metric with which to estimate their "total tax bill". The premise is that by comparing the benefits received by citizens to the amount they pay in taxes, the value of paying taxes can be assessed.

== History and methodology ==
The concept of Tax Freedom Day was developed in 1948 by Florida businessman Dallas Hostetler, who trademarked the phrase "Tax Freedom Day" and calculated it each year for the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;[[Madsen Pirie]], ''Think Tank: A Story of the Adam Smith Institute'', [[Biteback Publishing]], 2012, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Hostetler retired and transferred the trademark to the [[Tax Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=searchss&amp;state=4004:unant9.1.1 U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, "Tax Freedom Day"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tax Foundation has calculated Tax Freedom Day for the United States ever since, using it as a tool for illustrating the proportion of national income diverted to fund the annual cost of [[government]] programs. In 1990, the Tax Foundation began calculating the specific Tax Freedom Day for each individual state.

Tax Freedom Day only examines taxation, and does not account for debt and inflation as means for funding government.
# [[Government debt|Debt]] comes with a guarantee of future repayment. Governments run at a deficit by promising creditors to service and repay debts by taxing future labor or generating revenue through other means such as sale or exploitation of state owned assets.
# [[Inflation]] or currency debasement increases the supply of currency. This new currency could be used to pay for government, but the increased supply results in a decrease in value of each unit of currency. As the value of currency decreases, commodity prices increase as a result.

[[Leap year]]s have one day more, 29 February. This creates some bias in Tax Freedom Day charts. However, this bias is equal to roughly 1/366, which is about 0.27%.

==United States==
{{See also|Taxation in the United States}}

In the [[United States]], it is annually calculated by the [[Tax Foundation]], a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based tax research organization. In the U.S., Tax Freedom Day for 2015 is April 24, for a total average effective tax rate of 31 percent of the nation's income. The latest that Tax Freedom Day has occurred was May 1 in 2000. In 1900, Tax Freedom Day arrived January 22, for an effective average total tax rate of 5.9 percent of the nation's income. According to the Tax Foundation, the most important factor driving changes in Tax Freedom Day from year to year is growth in incomes, as the progressive structure of the U.S. federal tax system causes taxes as a percentage of income to rise along with inflation.

Tax Freedom Day varies among the 50 U.S. states, as incomes and state and local taxes differ from state to state. In 2015, [[Louisiana]] had the lowest total tax burden, earning enough to pay all their tax obligations by April 2. [[Connecticut]] had the heaviest tax burden – Tax Freedom Day there arrived May 13.

According to the Tax Foundation, the following is a list of Tax Freedom Days in the U.S. since 1900:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxdata/show/386.html The Tax Foundation – Tax Freedom Day and Tax Burden, 1900–2010&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world==
Many other organizations in countries throughout the world now produce their own "Tax Freedom Day" analysis. According to the Tax Foundation, Tax Freedom Day reports are currently being published in eight countries. Due to the different ways that nations collect and categorize public finance data, however, Tax Freedom Days are not comparable from one country to another.

===European Union===

A 2010 study published in L'Anglophone,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.langlophone.com/20100526_edition/20100526_EU27_data_table_flipped.pdf Wages and Taxes for the Average Joe in the EU 27]&lt;/ref&gt; a Brussels newspaper, compared the tax burdens of "Average Joes" in each of the 27 EU member states and projected the Tax Freedom Day for workers earning a typical wage. Income taxes, social security contributions (by the employee and the employer) and projected VAT contributions were included in the calculations.

Regarding the discrepancy between their calculation of August 3 as the typical Belgian worker's Tax Freedom Day and that of PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC), L'Anglophone's authors wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.langlophone.com/fullbn.php?id=419 Belgian Workers’ Wages are Highest-Taxed in Western Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; "[PWC's] figures count revenue from all taxes (including those on corporate profits, petrol, cigarettes, &amp;c.) and thus present a more complete picture of the country’s total tax burden," adding that it is "an average applied to all Belgians – not all Belgian workers; in 2008, less than half of Belgium’s population (4.99 million working out of 10.67 million citizens) was legally working. Consequently, a huge share of Belgium’s tax burden is borne by the working population."

==Criticism==
In the book ''[[Filthy Lucre: Economics for People Who Hate Capitalism]]'', philosopher [[Joseph Heath]] criticizes the idea that tax-paying is inherently different from consumption:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It would make just as much sense to declare an annual "mortgage freedom day", in order to let mortgage owners know what day they "stop working for the bank and start working for themselves". ...But who cares? Homeowners are not really "working for the bank"; they're merely financing their own consumption. After all, they're the ones living in the house, not the bank manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heath|first=Joseph|title=[[Filthy Lucre (book)|Filthy Lucre]]|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mathematical===
For Canada the [[Fraser Institute]] also includes a “Personal Tax Freedom Day Calculator” that estimates a customized Tax Freedom Day based on additional variables such as age of household head, sex of household head, marital status and number of children. However, the Fraser Institute's figures have been disputed. For example, a 2005 study by [[Osgoode Hall]] Law Professor Neil Brooks&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.osgoode.yorku.ca/faculty/neilbrooks.html |institution=Osgoode Hall |title=Professor Neil Brooks |year=2005 |accessdate=11 December 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216161715/http://www.osgoode.yorku.ca/faculty/neilbrooks.html |archivedate=16 December 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues the Fraser Institute's Tax Freedom Day analysis includes flawed accounting, including the exclusion of several important forms of income and overstating tax figures, moving the date nearly two months later.&lt;ref name="fn_1"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/National_Office_Pubs/2005/tax_freedom_day.pdf |title=Tax Freedom Day – A Flawed, Incoherent, and Pernicious Concept |date=5 June 2005 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, while Tax Freedom Day presents an "average American" tax burden, it is not a tax burden typical for an American. That is, the tax burdens of most Americans are substantially overstated by Tax Freedom Day. The larger tax bills associated with higher incomes increases the average tax burden above that of most Americans.

The [[Tax Foundation]] defends its methodology by pointing out that Tax Freedom Day is the U.S. economy's overall average tax burden—not the tax burden of the "average" American, which is how it is often misinterpreted by members of the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/1406.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Tax Foundation materials do not use the phrase "tax burden of the average American", although members of the media often make this mistake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxfreedomday/ The Tax Foundation – America Celebrates Tax Freedom Day&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that the calculation includes [[capital gain]]s taxes but not capital gains income, thus overstating the tax burden. For example, in the late 1990s the US Tax Freedom Day moved later, reaching its latest date ever in 2000, but this was largely due to capital gains taxes on the bull market of that era rather than an increase in tax rates. In other words, variations in capital gains income and their associated taxes cause changes in the amount of taxes, but not in the income used in the calculation of Tax Freedom Day.

The Tax Foundation argues that the Tax Freedom Day calculation does not include capital gains as income because it uses income and tax data directly from the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] (BEA). BEA has never counted [[capital gain]]s as income since they don't represent current production available to pay taxes, and so the Tax Foundation excludes them as well. Additionally, the Tax Foundation argues that the exclusion of capital gains income is irrelevant in most years since including capital gains would only shift Tax Freedom Day by 1 percent in either direction in most years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/1406.html]&lt;/ref&gt; A 1 percent change would represent 3.65 days. From 1968 to 2009 the date has never left the 21-day range of April 13 to May 3.

'''''The Baconing''''' is an [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Hothead Games]]. It was published by [[Valcon Games]] on the [[Xbox 360]] and independently on all other platforms. It was released August 30, 2011 for [[PlayStation 3]] via the [[PlayStation Network]] and August 31, 2011 for [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] via [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and for the Xbox 360 via [[Xbox Live Arcade]]. It is the third game in the ''[[DeathSpank]]'' series, and follows the character DeathSpank in his quest to defeat the AntiSpank, an evil incarnation of himself.

The game received mixed views from critics. Most critics enjoyed the game's humor, and those who did not noted that players who enjoyed the humor from the previous two games will enjoy ''The Baconing''. Critics were divided as to aspects of gameplay. Some thought that the game had too many repetitive quests, while others felt that gameplay was tightened in comparison to the previous two ''DeathSpank'' games.

==Premise==
[[File:Baconing screenshot.png|thumb|left|The game world in ''The Baconing'' is much more varied than that of the previous two ''DeathSpank'' titles.]]
{{See also|DeathSpank#Synopsis|l1=synopses of DeathSpank|DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue#Synopsis|l2=DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue}}
The game opens with a bored DeathSpank, the series' protagonist. Having defeated all of his foes in the land, he decides to try on all six mystical Thongs of Virtue at once, and in doing so inadvertently creates an evil incarnation of himself, the AntiSpank. DeathSpank must then travel the land to destroy five of the six Thongs of Virtue in the Fires of Bacon. Once he is successful he can defeat the AntiSpank and bring peace to SpankTopia.&lt;ref name="the game"&gt;{{cite video game | title=The Baconing | developer=Hothead Games |date=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{See also|DeathSpank#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay in DeathSpank}}
''The Baconing'' borrows much of its gameplay from the two previous titles in the ''DeathSpank'' series, ''[[DeathSpank]]'', and ''[[DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue]]''. As with the previous games, this title is an action RPG. The game can also be played cooperatively, with the first player controlling DeathSpank and the second having a choice to control one of four sidekicks.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thebaconing.com/about/ |publisher=[[Hothead Games]] |accessdate=2011-09-02 |title=About The Baconing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hothead Games addressed a concern from fans about [[fetch quest]]s, a [[Quest (video gaming)|quest]] which involves retrieving an object for the person giving the player character the quest.&lt;ref name="gamespot preview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/deathspank-the-baconing/news/6327490/the-baconing-preview?sid=6327490&amp;tag=result;title;0&amp;mode=previews |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2011-09-06 |date=2011-08-08 |first=Sophia |last=Tong |title=The Baconing Preview}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player can now have the character execute a shield bash to push enemies away.

''The Baconing'' was announced on May 25, 2011 for the Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3.&lt;ref name="joystiq announce"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/05/25/deathspank-the-baconing-is-the-third-entry-in-the-deathspank-se/ |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=2011-09-02 |date=2011-05-25 |first=Ben |last=Gilbert |title=DeathSpank: The Baconing is the third entry in the DeathSpank series, coming this summer}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''DeathSpank'' was dropped from the game's title, though it is a continuation of the ''DeathSpank'' series. Producer Mike Inglehart stated "This new title isn't ''DeathSpank 3'' or ''DeathSpank: The Baconing'', instead it should be thought of as ''The Baconing''." Inglehart elaborated by saying that "this is a standalone experience that will appeal to fans of the DeathSpank character, but also to gamers everywhere who love unique and engaging video games."&lt;ref name="baconing name"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/05/27/hothead-explains-lack-of-deathspank-in-the-baconings-title/ |first=Ben |last=Gilbert |accessdate=2011-09-02 |date=2011-05-27 |publisher=Joystiq |title=Hothead explains lack of 'DeathSpank' in The Baconing's title}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inglehart also clarified that the ''DeathSpank'' prefix was not removed due to copyright or trademark issues.&lt;ref name="baconing name" /&gt;

Several reviewers praised the game's colorful characters, humor and voice acting. Will Herring of [[GamePro]] commented in his review that ''The Baconing'' has "clever writing and great voice acting throughout".&lt;ref name="gamepro review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/222633/review-the-baconing-360-ps3/ |first=Will |last=Herring |accessdate=2011-09-15 |publisher=[[GamePro]] |title=Review: The Baconing (360/PS3) |date=2011-09-06|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/222633/review-the-baconing-360-ps3/&amp;date=2011-11-30+22:29:21|archivedate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Christian Donlan called the game's writing "witty stuff" and added that "the script can't wait to shoot off on strange tangents".&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-09-06-the-baconing-review |date=2011-09-06 |accessdate=2011-09-15 |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |title=The Baconing - Review |first=Christian |last=Donlan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Mc Shea of [[GameSpot]] also praised the game's cast and called them both "oddball" and "amusing".&lt;ref name="gamespot review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/deathspank-the-baconing/review.html?tag=updates%3Blatest%3Breviews%3Btitle%3B2 |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=2011-09-02 |title=The Baconing Review |date=2011-09-01 |first=Tom |last=Mc Shea}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Tan of [[Game Revolution]] felt that the dialogue was over-the-top and enjoyable as well.&lt;ref name="gamerev review"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=[[Game Revolution]] |accessdate=2011-09-15 |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/the-baconing |first=Nick |last=Tan |date=2011-09-02 |title=The Baconing Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics were divided on the gameplay aspects of ''The Baconing''. Game Revolution's Nick Tan noted that the combat system had been upgraded from the previous two titles, and that the addition of a shield bash mechanic helped when enemies crowded the player character. He also praised the new ability to choose between one of four characters for cooperative gameplay.&lt;ref name="gamerev review" /&gt; GamePro's Will Herring, however, felt the gameplay was repetitive and that the fetch quests did not feature enough variety.&lt;ref name="gamepro review" /&gt; Though Christian Donlan of Eurogamer had some critical remarks in regards to gameplay he did note that the game is "a fiercely likeable time-waster."&lt;ref name="eurogamer review" /&gt; [[IGN]]'s Kristine Steimer recommended that players consider playing ''DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue'' first, as their opinion would be a good judge towards interest in ''The Baconing''.&lt;ref name="ign review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/119/1192096p1.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2011-09-02 |date=2011-09-01 |first=Kristine |last=Steimer |title=The Baconing Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theatre for Young Audiences''' (TYA) is a branch of [[theatre arts]] that encompasses all forms of theatre that are attended by or created for younger audiences. It blankets many different forms of theatre methods and expressions, including plays, dance, music, puppetry, circus, [[physical theatre]], and many others. It is globally practiced, takes many forms, both traditional and non-traditional, and explores a wide variety of themes ranging from fairy tales to parental abuse.  

Originating in the 20th century, TYA is a recent branch of Theatre Arts. It takes on many functions in different settings and places around the world. In the US, for instance, it is often entertainment-centered, although its roots lie in education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Many writers and production companies have started catering specifically to TYA audiences, causing a continuous increase in theatrical material for children. In the present day, TYA production companies or groups can be found in most regions of the US and around the world. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

==History==

Theatre performed by or for children dates back hundreds of years. The first mention is seen in a 1784 entry in [[Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis|Madame de Genlis]]’s Memoirs, in which she describes a performance by her two daughters to the [[Duke of Chartres]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theatre for Children|last=Ward|first=Winifred|publisher=D. Appleton-Century Company Inc.|year=1939|isbn=|location=London|pages=2-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; TYA became its own branch of theatre in the 20th century, first appearing in Moscow, when Russian actress [[Natalya Sats|Natalia Satz]] founded the Moscow Theatre for Children in 1918. In its early stages, the Moscow Theatre for Children viewed its goal as representing childhood needs, separating the struggles of childhood from those of adult life. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similar TYA groups were established in England, the US, France, and Czechoslovakia between World War I and World War II &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/theatre-for-young-audiences/|title=Theatre for Young Audiences|last=James|first=Joanne|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==TYA in the United States==

Education was the main purpose of TYA when it first arrived to the US. In 1903, [[Alice Minnie Herts]] founded The Children’s Educational Theatre, which was the first US company to produce theatrical work both with and for children. Although it did not last long, The Children’s Educational Theatre inspired both the birth of other companies around the country, as well as continuous growth in the writing and production of plays for younger audiences &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. The Drama League of America was another big influence in TYA within the US: children’s leagues were established in cities across the country, and material for younger audiences was both presented at these establishments and distributed to any interested groups. The Drama League was responsible for changing theatre for children from its originally purely educational intent into the broader Theatre for Young Audiences known today. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children's Theatre|last=Goldberg|first=Moses|publisher=Prentice-Hall Inc.|year=1974|isbn=|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|pages=3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the TYA movement started to gain traction, many different companies and playwrights chose to partake in this new branch of theatre. Some include early TYA playwright Constance Mackay, the Chicago company The Junior League, New York producer [[Clare Tree Major]], The Children’s Theatre of Evanston, and many others. Today, TYA continues to thrive, with an increasing number of playwrights, performers, producers, and companies taking part in it. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Types of Theatre for Young Audiences==

Most  TYA  productions in the US are plays, with a fast-growing number of musicals taking second place. However, most performing arts forms have been adapted and incorporated into Theatre for Young Audiences, including physical theatre, operas, puppetry, dance, street performance, and many others. &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theatre for Young Audiences|last=McCaslin|first=Nellie|publisher=Longman Inc.|year=1978|isbn=0-582-28011-7|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies specifically cater to non-traditional theatre forms, such as the MainStreet Theatre Company and the Center for Pupetry Arts, Atlanta. Several major companies performing Theatre for Young Audiences exist across the US, including but not limited to Minneapolis [[Children's Theatre Company|Children’s Theatre Company]], [[Seattle Children's Theatre|Seattle Children’s Theatre]], Lexington Children’s Theatre, Adventure State Chicago, and Boston Children’s Theatre, all producing work specifically for younger audiences throughout the year, offering performances both of new work and TYA classics &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. 

==Techniques==

Most Theatre for Young Audiences plays are written by adult playwrights, although occasional projects are led and constructed by the younger audiences themselves. Different schools of thought within TYA  argue whether or not younger characters should be portrayed by children or by adult actors. At the present, most TYA productions in children’s companies around the country count on casts of professional adult actors to portray all roles. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, the [[Arvada Center for the Arts and Humanities|Arvada Center]]’s 2016 production of an adaptation of the novel ''[[Junie B. Jones]]'' was produced with adult actors, including Melissa Morris, Katie Jackson, and Rachelle Wood, portraying characters who are around the age of 12. A number children’s companies in the US have designated programs, in which the children engage with workshops and experimental rehearsals in order to create a TYA production with child actors. Those are rarely, however, part of the companies’ main stage season. Many Theatre for Young Audiences productions still revolve around traditional child-friendly topics, such as fairy tales and magical quests. A number of theatre companies, such as [[Seattle Children's Theatre|Seattle Children’s Theatre]] and the Minneapolis [[Children's Theatre Company|Children’s Theatre Company]], have been working to create and produce  plays and musicals for young audiences that are more intelligent and diverse. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spotlight on the Child: Studies in the History of American Children's Theatre|last=Bedard|first=Roger L.|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1989|isbn=0-313-25793-0|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent work has explored themes that include parental abuse (e.g. ''An Afternoon of the Elves'' by [[Janet Taylor Lisle]]), divorce (e.g. ''Doors'', by Suzan Zeder), death (e.g. ''Afflicted'', by Laurie Brooks), and social barriers such as racism, xenophobia, and homophobia (e.g. ''The Transition of Doodle Pequeño'', by Gabriel Jason Dean).
