'''''A Vedic Word Concordance''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|Vaidika-Padānukrama-Koṣa}}'' ) is a multi-volume [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] of the corpus of [[Vedic Sanskrit]] texts. It has been under preparation from 1930 and was published in 1935-1965 under the guidance of {{IAST|Viśvabandhu Śāstrī}} (d. 1973), with an introduction in Sanskrit and English. It aims to be "a universal vocabulary register" of "Vedic works, with complete textual reference and critical [[Commentary (philology)|commentary]] bearing on [[phonology]], [[Vedic accent|accent]], etymo-morphology, grammar, [[Vedic meter|metre]], text-criticism, and [[Proto-Indo-Iranian|Ur-Aryan]] philology".

==Contents==
The work covers 123,000 word-bases and 5,000,000 word forms found in about 400 Vedic and [[Vedanga]] texts, including [[Vedas|Samhitas]], [[Brahmanas]], [[Aranyakas]] and [[Upanishads]] (even very late ones). The Vedanga section does not cover all the published Shrauta or Grihya texts, however, while the Upanishad section also includes the [[Bhagavad Gita]].

The concordance extends to about  11,000 pages, published in 16 parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jamison |first= Stephanie W.|author2= [[Michael Witzel|Witzel, Michael]]|editor= Sharma, Arvind|title= The Study of Hinduism |year= 2003|publisher= University of S. Carolina Press|location= |language= |isbn= 1-57003-449-4|pages= 109–110|chapter= Vedic Hinduism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Section: Samhitas (6 parts), 1942-63.
:Section II: Brahmanas and Aranyakas (2 parts), 1935,36
:Section III: Upanishads (2 parts), 1945
:Section IV: Vedangas (4 parts), 1958-61
:Index (2 parts), 1964-65.

A revised and enlarged edition was published 1973-1976.

==History of development==
[[Acharya Vishva Bandhu|Vishva Bandhu Shastri]] continued the work of Vishveshvaranand and Nityanand, who had published word indices to the four Vedic Samhitas in 1908-1910, leading the ''Vishveshvaranand Institute'' from 1924 until his death in 1973.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title = Education in Hoshiarpur |url = http://hoshiarpur.nic.in/html/education.htm| publisher = Hoshiarpur District Administration|accessdate = 2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[partition of India]], the institute moved to its present premises at Sadhu Ashram, [[Hoshiarpur]], [[Punjab, India]]. Most of the approximately 6000 Sanskrit manuscripts formerly located at the Dayanand College of Lahore were clandestinely brought to Hoshiarpur at the time. Since 1965, the institute has been incorporated in the [[Panjab University, Chandigarh]] as the ''Vishveshvaranand Institute of Sanskrit and Indological Studies'' (VISIS).&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Based on the ''Vedic Word Concordance'', the institute currently compiles a ''Dictionary of Vedic Interpretation'', of which the first volume, running up to the lemma ''Agni'', has been completed.

{{Acts of Reparation}}
[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] tradition and [[Mariology (Roman Catholic)|Mariology]] include specific prayers and devotions as [[acts of reparation]] for insults and blasphemies against the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]].  Similar prayers as ''[[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]]'' and ''[[Acts of Reparation to The Holy Trinity]]'' also exist.

Some such prayers are provided in the [[Raccolta]] Catholic prayer book, first published in association with the Catholic [[Congregation of Indulgences]] in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620a.htm Delany, Francis Xavier. "Raccolta." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 15 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reparation for insults to the Blessed Virgin Mary==
Words of the Prayer from [[Raccolta]]:
:O Blessed Virgin, Mother of God, look down in mercy from Heaven, where thou art enthroned as Queen, upon me, a miserable sinner, thine unworthy servant. Although I know full well my own unworthiness, yet in order to atone for the offenses that are done to thee by impious and blasphemous tongues, from the depths of my heart I praise and extol thee as the purest, the fairest, the holiest creature of all God's handiwork. I bless thy Holy name, I praise thine exalted privilege of being truly Mother of God, ever Virgin, conceived without stain of sin, Co-Redemptrix of the human race. I bless the Eternal Father who chose thee in an especial way for His daughter; I bless the Word Incarnate who took upon Himself our nature in thy bosom and so made thee His Mother; I bless the Holy Spirit who took thee as His bride. All honor, praise and thanksgiving to the ever-blessed Trinity who predestined thee and loved thee so exceedingly from all eternity as to exalt thee above all creatures to the most sublime heights. O Virgin, holy and merciful, obtain for all who offend thee the grace of repentance, and graciously accept this poor act of homage from me thy servant, obtaining likewise for me from thy Divine Son the pardon and remission of all my sins. Amen.

==Reparation for blasphemy against the Blessed Virgin Mary==
{{Roman Catholic Mariology}}
Words of the Prayer from [[Raccolta]]:

:Most glorious Virgin Mary, Mother of God and our Mother, turn thine eyes in pity upon us, miserable sinners; we are sore afflicted by the many evils that surround us in this life, but especially do we feel our hearts break within us upon hearing the dreadful insults and blasphemies uttered against thee, O Virgin Immaculate. O how these impious sayings offend the infinite Majesty of God and of His only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ! How they provoke His indignation and give us cause to fear the terrible effects of His vengeance! ...We desire, O most Holy Mother, to love thee and to honor thee with all our hearts, since this is the Will of God. And just because we love thee, we will do all that is in our power to make thee honored and loved by all men. In the meantime do thou, our merciful Mother, the supreme comforter of the afflicted, accept this our act of reparation which we offer thee for ourselves and for all our families, as well as for all who impiously blaspheme thee, not knowing what they say. Do thou obtain for them from Almighty God the grace of conversion, and thus render more manifest and more glorious thy kindness, thy power and thy great mercy. May they join with us in proclaiming thee Blessed among women, the Immaculate Virgin and most compassionate Mother of God.(Racccolta, 1950)

:[[Hail Mary]] three times.

'''Ali bey Huseyn oğlu Huseynzade''' ({{lang-az|Əli bəy Hüseyn oğlu Hüseyzadə}}; {{lang-tr|Hüseyinzade Ali Turan}}; [[Salyan, Azerbaijan|Salyan]], February 24, 1864 – [[Istanbul]], March 17, 1940) was an [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] writer, thinker, philosopher, artist, doctor, and the creator of the modern [[Flag of Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Whitney |last=Smith |title=Flag Lore Of All Nations |publisher=Millbrook Press |year=2001 |page=13 |isbn=0-7613-1753-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Ali bey Huseynzade was born in 1864 to a family of Muslim religious cleric in [[Salyan, Azerbaijan|Salyan]], in the present-day [[Azerbaijan]]. His grand father [[Mahammadali Huseinzadeh]] was the [[Sheikh ul-Islam]] (Supreme religious leader) of the Caucasus for 32 years. Ali bey received his primary education at the Tiflis Muslim school followed by the Tiflis Classical Gymnasium. In 1885, he entered the Physics and Math Department at [[Saint Petersburg University]]. Upon graduation from there in 1889, Huseynzade moved to Istanbul, where he entered the Medical faculty of [[Istanbul University]] (IU). After graduation from IU, he served as a military doctor in the [[Ottoman Army]], and subsequently as an Assistant Professor at IU. Huseynzade was one of the founders of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Из истории азербайджанской буржуазии в начале XX века |last=Seyidzade |first=D.

==Public activity==
In 1903, Ali bey returned home and spent the next 7 years in [[Baku]]. During this period of time, he engaged in scholarly and publishing activities, edited the "Heyat" newspaper, and served as a chief editor of "Kaspiy" newspaper. In 1905, he joined Alimardan Topchubashev, Farrukh Vezirov, Adil Khan Ziyadkhanov and [[Ahmet Ağaoğlu|Ahmed bey Aghayev]] as a part of Azerbaijani delegation to an all-Russian convention of Muslims, where an agreement was reached on establishing of a single Muslim party in Russian Empire. In 1906, Huseynzade started publishing the "Fiyuzat" magazine, financed by the famous philanthropist [[Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev]], and harshly criticized the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist government]] in his writings.

In 1910, Huseynzade moved to the Ottoman Empire, where he was elected a presiding member of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]]. In 1918, he returned to Azerbaijan to participate in the formation of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (ADR), and participated in negotiations for the Ottoman support of the ADR against the [[Baku Commune]]. After the fall of ADR in April 1920, Huseynzade permanently settled in [[Turkey]] and became a citizen of this country, receiving the surname Turan.&lt;ref name="huseyinzadealituran"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huseyinzadealituran.com/uploads/files/d39ed7830846c75b7424d5a6c9f6a6ef_544.pdf|date=21 June 2013|title=Tam sayfa faks yazdırma|author=YAVUZ AKPINAR|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anaximander''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|ˌ|n|æ|k|s|ɪ|ˈ|m|æ|n|d|ər}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀναξίμανδρος}} ''Anaximandros''; {{nowrap|{{circa|610|546}} BC)}} was a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] who lived in [[Miletus]],&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;"Anaximander" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; a city of [[Ionia]] (in modern-day Turkey). He belonged to the [[Milesian school]] and learned the teachings of his master [[Thales]]. He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] and, arguably, [[Pythagoras]] amongst his pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.google.de/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Porphyry%2C+Life+of+Pythagoras+Anaximander|title=Porphyry, Life of Pythagoras Anaximander}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little of his life and work is known today. According to available historical documents, he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies,&lt;ref&gt;[[Themistius]], ''Oratio'' 36, §317&lt;/ref&gt; although only one fragment of his work remains. Fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide a portrait of the man.

He was an early proponent of [[science]] and tried to observe and explain different aspects of the universe, with a particular [[cosmogony|interest in its origins]], claiming that nature is ruled by laws, just like human societies, and anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last long.&lt;ref&gt;Park, David (2005) ''The Grand Contraption'', Princeton University Press {{ISBN|0-691-12133-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many thinkers of his time, Anaximander's [[philosophy]] included contributions to many disciplines. In [[astronomy]], he attempted to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the Earth. In physics, his postulation that the indefinite (or [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]) was the source of all things led Greek philosophy to a new level of conceptual abstraction. His knowledge of [[geometry]] allowed him to introduce the [[gnomon]] in Greece. He created a map of the world that contributed greatly to the advancement of [[geography]]. He was also involved in the [[politics]] of Miletus and was sent as a leader to one of its colonies.

==Biography==
[[Image:Anaximander.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Detail of [[Raphael]]'s painting ''[[The School of Athens]]'', 1510–1511. This could be a representation of Anaximander leaning towards [[Pythagoras]] on his left.&lt;ref&gt;This character is traditionally associated with [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]], however his face offering similarities with the relief of Anaximander (image in the box above), it could be a representation of the philosopher. See {{cite web |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/SchoolAthens2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214002240/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/SchoolAthens2.htm |archivedate=2007-02-14 |df= }} for a description of the characters in this painting.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Anaximander, son of Praxiades, was born in the third year of the 42nd [[Olympiad]] (610 BC).&lt;ref name="Refutation"&gt;[[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] (?), ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]'' (I, 5)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Apollodorus of Athens]], Greek grammarian of the 2nd century BC, he was sixty-four years old during the second year of the 58th Olympiad (547–546&amp;nbsp;BC), and died shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Chronicles'', as reported by [[Diogenes Laërtius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' (II, 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishing a timeline of his work is now impossible, since no document provides chronological references. [[Themistius]], a 4th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[rhetoric]]ian, mentions that he was the "first of the known Greeks to publish a written document on nature." Therefore, his texts would be amongst the earliest written in [[prose]], at least in the Western world. By the time of [[Plato]], his philosophy was almost forgotten, and [[Aristotle]], his successor [[Theophrastus]] and a few [[Doxography|doxographers]] provide us with the little information that remains. However, we know from Aristotle that Thales, also from Miletus, precedes Anaximander. It is debatable whether Thales actually was the teacher of Anaximander, but there is no doubt that Anaximander was influenced by Thales' theory that everything is derived from water. One thing that is not debatable is that even the ancient Greeks considered Anaximander to be from the [[Monist]] school which began in Miletus, with Thales followed by Anaximander and finished with [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard D. McKirahan, ''Philosophy before Socrates'', Ch 5, 32–34&lt;/ref&gt;  3rd-century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rhetorician [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] depicts him as leader of the Milesian colony to [[Sozopol|Apollonia]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast, and hence some have inferred that he was a prominent citizen.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Anaximander|page=944}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, ''Various History'' (III, 17) explains that philosophers sometimes also dealt with political matters. It is very likely that leaders of Miletus sent him there as a legislator to create a constitution or simply to maintain the colony's allegiance.

Anaximander lived the final few years of his life as a subject of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dandamaev|first1=M. A.|authorlink1=Muhammad Dandamayev|title=A Political History of the Achaemenid Empire|date=1989|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-9004091726|page=153|quote=During the period of Achaemenid rule in Miletus, which was the most important city of Ionia, there lived the eminent philosopher Anaximander and the geographer and historian Hecataeus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
Anaximander's theories were influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythical]] tradition, and by some ideas of [[Thales]]&amp;nbsp;– the father of philosophy&amp;nbsp;– as well as by observations made by older civilizations in the East{{Dubious|date=October 2012}} (especially by the Babylonian astrologers).&lt;ref&gt;C. Mosse (1984) ''La Grèce archaïque d' Homere à Eschyle''. Édition du Seuil. p236&lt;/ref&gt; All these were elaborated rationally. In his desire to find some universal principle, he assumed, like traditional religion, the existence of a cosmic order; and in elaborating his ideas on this he used the old mythical language which ascribed divine control to various spheres of reality. This was a common practice for the Greek philosophers in a society which saw gods everywhere, and therefore could fit their ideas into a tolerably elastic system.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World publishing Company. Cleveland and New York. p168,169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars see a gap between the existing mythical and the new [[rationalism|rational]] way of thought which is the main characteristic of the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]] (8th to 6th century BC) in the Greek [[city-state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Ernest Cushman]] claims Anaximander has "the first European philosophical conception of god", ''A beginner's history of philosophy'', Volume 1 pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt; This has given rise to the phrase "Greek miracle". But if we follow carefully the course of Anaximander's ideas, we will notice that there was not such an abrupt break as initially appears. The basic elements of nature ([[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]]) which the first Greek philosophers believed constituted the universe represent in fact the primordial forces of previous thought. Their collision produced what the mythical tradition had called cosmic harmony. In the old cosmogonies&amp;nbsp;– [[Hesiod]] (8th&amp;nbsp;– 7th century&amp;nbsp;BC) and [[Pherecydes of Syros|Pherecydes]] (6th century BC)&amp;nbsp;– [[Zeus]] establishes his order in the world by destroying the powers which were threatening this harmony (the [[Titans (mythology)|Titans]]). Anaximander claimed that the cosmic order is not [[monarchic]] but [[geometric]], and that this causes the equilibrium of the earth, which is lying in the centre of the universe. This is the projection on nature of a new political order and a new space organized around a centre which is the static point of the system in the society as in nature.&lt;ref&gt;C. Mosse (1984) ''La Grece archaique d'Homere a Eschyle''. Edition du Seuil. p 235&lt;/ref&gt; In this space there is ''isonomy'' (equal rights) and all the forces are symmetrical and transferrable. The decisions are now taken by the assembly of ''[[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]]'' in the ''[[agora]]'' which is lying in the middle of the city.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Vernart (1982) ''Les origins de la pensee grecque''. PUF Pariw. p 128, J. P. Vernart (1982) ''The origins of the Greek thought''. Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same ''rational'' way of thought led him to introduce the abstract ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]'' (indefinite, infinite, boundless, unlimited&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29pei%2Frwn2 ἀπείρων], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) as an origin of the universe, a concept that is probably influenced by the original [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]] (gaping void, abyss, formless state) of the mythical [[Greece|Greek]] [[cosmogony]] from which everything else appeared.&lt;ref&gt;''The Theogony of Hesiod'', Transl. H. G. Evelyn White, 736–740&lt;/ref&gt; It also takes notice of the mutual changes between the four elements. Origin, then, must be something else unlimited in its source, that could create without experiencing decay, so that genesis would never stop.&lt;ref&gt;Aetios, I 3,3 [ [[Pseudo-Plutarch]]; DK 12 A 14.]; Aristotle, ''Phys.'' Γ5,204b 23sq. [DK 12 A 16.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apeiron===
{{Main|Apeiron (cosmology)|Matter#Antiquity (c. 610 BC–c. 322 BC)}}

The ''Refutation'' attributed to [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (I, 5), and the later 6th century Byzantine philosopher [[Simplicius of Cilicia]], attribute to Anaximander the earliest use of the word ''apeiron'' ({{lang|grc|ἄπειρον}} "infinite" or "limitless") to designate the original principle. He was the first philosopher to employ, in a philosophical context, the term ''[[Arche|archē]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἀρχή}}), which until then had meant beginning or origin. For him, it became no longer a mere point in time, but a source that could perpetually give birth to whatever will be. The indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in [[Homer]] (indefinite sea) and as in [[Xenophanes]] (6th century BC) who said that the earth went down indefinitely (to ''apeiron'') i.e. beyond the imagination or concept of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kirk |first=G. S. |last2=Raven |first2=J. E. |last3=Schofield |first3=M. |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|last-author-amp=yes| date=2003| publisher=Cambridge University Press| url= https://books.google.com/?id=kFpd86J8PLsC&amp;pg| isbn=978-0-521-27455-5| page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle writes (''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', I.III 3–4) that the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratics]] were searching for the element that constitutes all things. While each pre-Socratic philosopher gave a different answer as to the identity of this element ([[water (classical element)|water]] for Thales and [[air (classical element)|air]] for Anaximenes), Anaximander understood the beginning or first principle to be an endless, unlimited primordial mass (''apeiron''), subject to neither old age nor decay, that perpetually yielded fresh materials from which everything we perceive is derived.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Plutarch]], ''The Doctrines of the Philosophers'' (I, 3).&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the theory of the ''apeiron'' in direct response to the earlier theory of his teacher, Thales, who had claimed that the primary substance was water. The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious concept of immortality, and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This ''archē'' is called "eternal and ageless". (Hippolytus (?), ''Refutation'', I,6,I;DK B2)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Guthrie |first=William Keith Chambers |title=A History of Greek Philosophy| date=2000| publisher=Cambridge University Press| url= https://books.google.com/?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&amp;pg| isbn=978-0-521-29420-1 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Anaximander, the [[Principle (chemistry)|principle]] of things, the constituent of all substances, is nothing determined and not an element such as water in Thales' view. Neither is it something halfway between air and water, or between air and fire, thicker than air and fire, or more subtle than water and earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'' (II, 5)&lt;/ref&gt; Anaximander argues that water cannot embrace all of the opposites found in nature — for example, water can only be wet, never dry — and therefore cannot be the one primary substance; nor could any of the other candidates. He postulated the ''apeiron'' as a substance that, although not directly perceptible to us, could explain the opposites he saw around him.

Anaximander explains how the [[Classical element|four elements]] of ancient physics ([[air (classical element)|air]], [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[water (classical element)|water]] and [[fire (classical element)|fire]]) are formed, and how Earth and terrestrial beings are formed through their interactions. Unlike other Pre-Socratics, he never defines this principle precisely, and it has generally been understood (e.g., by Aristotle and by [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]) as a sort of primal [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]. According to him, the Universe originates in the separation of opposites in the primordial matter. It embraces the opposites of hot and cold, wet and dry, and directs the movement of things; an entire host of shapes and differences then grow that are found in "all the worlds" (for he believed there were many).&lt;ref name="Chisholm1911"/&gt;

Anaximander maintains that all dying things are returning to the element from which they came (''apeiron''). The one surviving fragment of Anaximander's writing deals with this matter. Simplicius transmitted it as a quotation, which describes the balanced and mutual changes of the elements:&lt;ref&gt;[[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], ''Comments on Aristotle's Physics'' (24, 13):

: "{{lang|grc|Ἀναξίμανδρος [...] λέγει δ' αὐτὴν μήτε ὕδωρ μήτε ἄλλο τι τῶν καλουμένων εἶναι στοιχείων, ἀλλ' ἑτέραν τινὰ φύσιν ἄπειρον, ἐξ ἧς ἅπαντας γίνεσθαι τοὺς οὐρανοὺς καὶ τοὺς ἐν αὐτοῖς κόσμους· ἐξ ὧν δὲ ἡ γένεσίς ἐστι τοῖς οὖσι, καὶ τὴν φθορὰν εἰς ταῦτα γίνεσθαι κατὰ τὸ χρεών· διδόναι γὰρ αὐτὰ δίκην καὶ τίσιν ἀλλήλοις τῆς ἀδικίας κατὰ τὴν τοῦ χρόνου τάξιν, ποιητικωτέροις οὕτως ὀνόμασιν αὐτὰ λέγων. δῆλον δὲ ὅτι τὴν εἰς ἄλληλα μεταβολὴν τῶν τεττάρων στοιχείων οὗτος θεασάμενος οὐκ ἠξίωσεν ἕν τι τούτων ὑποκείμενον ποιῆσαι, ἀλλά τι ἄλλο παρὰ ταῦτα· οὗτος δὲ οὐκ ἀλλοιουμένου τοῦ στοιχείου τὴν γένεσιν ποιεῖ, ἀλλ' ἀποκρινομένων τῶν ἐναντίων διὰ τῆς αἰδίου κινήσεως.}}"

In [[Ancient Greek]] quotes usually blend with surrounding text. Consequently, deciding where they start and where they end is often difficult. However, it is generally accepted that this quote is not Simplicius' own interpretation, {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  but Anaximander's writing, in "somewhat poetic terms" as it is mentioned by Simplicius.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curd, Patricia, ''A Presocratics Reader: Selected Fragments and Testimonia'' ([[Hackett Publishing]], 1996), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whence things have their origin,&lt;br /&gt;
Thence also their destruction happens,&lt;br /&gt;
According to necessity;&lt;br /&gt;
For they give to each other justice and recompense&lt;br /&gt;
For their injustice&lt;br /&gt;
In conformity with the ordinance of Time.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Simplicius mentions that Anaximander said all these "in poetic terms", meaning that he used the old mythical language. The goddess Justice ([[Dike (mythology)|Dike]]) keeps the cosmic order.
This concept of returning to the element of origin was often revisited afterwards, notably by Aristotle,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', I, 3, 983 ''b'' 8–11; ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', III, 5, 204 ''b'' 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Greek [[Tragedy|tragedian]] [[Euripides]]: "what comes from earth must return to earth."&lt;ref&gt;Euripides''[[The Suppliants (Euripides)|Supplices]]'', v. 532&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in his ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', stated that Anaximander viewed "... all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'' (1873) § 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist [[Max Born]], in commenting upon [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s arriving at the idea that the elementary particles of [[quantum mechanics]] are to be seen as different manifestations, different quantum states, of one and the same “primordial substance,”' proposed that this primordial substance be called ''apeiron''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Cosmology===
[[Image:Anaximander cosmology-en.svg|thumb|left|280px|Map of Anaximander's universe]]

Anaximander's bold use of non-[[Greek mythology|mythological]] explanatory hypotheses considerably distinguishes him from previous cosmology writers such as [[Hesiod]]. It confirms that pre-Socratic philosophers were making an early effort to demystify physical processes. His major contribution to history was writing the oldest prose document about the [[Universe]] and the origins of [[life]]; for this he is often called the "Father of [[Cosmology]]" and founder of astronomy. However, [[pseudo-Plutarch]] states that he still viewed celestial bodies as deities.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Doctrines of the Philosophers'', i. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaximander was the first to conceive a [[Mechanics|mechanical]] model of the [[world]]. In his model, the [[Earth]] floats very still in the centre of the infinite, not supported by anything. It remains "in the same place because of its indifference", a point of view that Aristotle considered ingenious, but false, in ''[[On the Heavens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''On the Heavens'', ii, 13&lt;/ref&gt; Its curious shape is that of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]&lt;ref&gt;"A column of stone", [[Aëtius (theologian)|Aetius]] reports in ''De Fide'' (III, 7, 1), or "similar to a pillar-shaped stone", pseudo-Plutarch (III, 10).&lt;/ref&gt; with a height one-third of its diameter. The flat top forms the inhabited world, which is surrounded by a circular oceanic mass.

Anaximander's realization that the Earth floats free without falling and does not need to be resting on something has been indicated by many as the first cosmological revolution and the starting point of scientific thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Rovelli, "The First Scientist, Anaximander and his Legacy" (Yardley: Westholme, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel W. Graham, "Explaining the Cosmos: The Ionian Tradition of Scientific Philosophy" (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Popper calls this idea "one of the boldest, most revolutionary, and most portentous ideas in the whole history of human thinking."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, "Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge" (New York: Routledge, 1998), pg 186.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a model allowed the concept that [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]] could pass under the Earth, opening the way to Greek astronomy.

[[Image:Persectives of Anaximander's universe.png|thumb|right|350px|Illustration of Anaximander's models of the universe. On the left, daytime in summer; on the right, nighttime in winter. However, Anaximander pictured the earth as a truncated cylinder, not as a sphere as shown.]]

At the origin, after the separation of [[Temperature|hot and cold]], a ball of flame appeared that surrounded Earth like bark on a tree. This ball broke apart to form the rest of the Universe. It resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels, filled with fire, with the rims pierced by holes like those of a flute. Consequently, the [[Sun]] was the fire that one could see through a hole the same size as the Earth on the farthest wheel, and an eclipse corresponded with the [[Occultation|occlusion]] of that hole. The diameter of the solar wheel was twenty-seven times that of the Earth (or twenty-eight, depending on the sources)&lt;ref&gt;In ''Refutation'', it is reported that the circle of the Sun is twenty-seven times bigger than the Moon.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Moon|lunar]] wheel, whose fire was less intense, eighteen (or nineteen) times. Its hole could change shape, thus explaining [[lunar phase]]s. The [[star]]s and the [[planet]]s, located closer,&lt;ref&gt;Aetius, ''De Fide'' (II, 15, 6)&lt;/ref&gt; followed the same model.&lt;ref&gt;Most of Anaximander's model of the Universe comes from pseudo-Plutarch (II, 20–28):

: "[The Sun] is a circle twenty-eight times as big as the Earth, with the outline similar to that of a fire-filled chariot wheel, on which appears a mouth in certain places and through which it exposes its fire, as through the hole on a flute. [...] the Sun is equal to the Earth, but the circle on which it breathes and on which it's borne is twenty-seven times as big as the whole earth. [...] [The eclipse] is when the mouth from which comes the fire heat is closed. [...] [The Moon] is a circle nineteen times as big as the whole earth, all filled with fire, like that of the Sun".&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaximander was the first astronomer to consider the Sun as a huge mass, and consequently, to realize how far from Earth it might be, and the first to present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances. Furthermore, according to Diogenes Laertius (II, 2), he built a [[celestial spheres|celestial sphere]]. This invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the [[Axial tilt|obliquity]] of the [[Zodiac]] as the Roman philosopher [[Pliny the Elder]] reports in ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (II, 8). It is a little early to use the term [[ecliptic]], but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the Earth to explain the seasons. The [[doxography|doxographer]] and theologian Aetius attributes to Pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity.

===Multiple worlds===
According to Simplicius, Anaximander already speculated on the [[Cosmic pluralism|plurality of worlds]], similar to [[atomism|atomists]] [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]], and later philosopher [[Epicurus]]. These thinkers supposed that worlds appeared and disappeared for a while, and that some were born when others perished. They claimed that this movement was eternal, "for without movement, there can be no generation, no destruction".&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''Commentary on Aristotle's Physics'', 1121, 5–9&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Simplicius, Hippolytus&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus (?), ''Refutation'' I, 6&lt;/ref&gt; reports Anaximander's claim that from the infinite comes the principle of beings, which themselves come from the heavens and the worlds (several doxographers use the plural when this philosopher is referring to the worlds within,&lt;ref&gt;Notably pseudo-Plutarch (III, 2) and Aetius, (I, 3, 3; I, 7, 12; II, 1, 3; II, 1, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; which are often infinite in quantity). [[Cicero]] writes that he attributes different gods to the countless worlds.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Nature of the Gods'' (I, 10, 25):

: ''"Anaximandri autem opinio est nativos esse deos longis intervallis orientis occidentisque, eosque innumerabiles esse mundos."''
: "For Anaximander, gods were born, but the time is long between their birth and their death; and the worlds are countless."&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory places Anaximander close to the Atomists and the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] who, more than a century later, also claimed that an infinity of worlds appeared and disappeared. In the [[Timeline of Western philosophers#Classical philosophers|timeline of the Greek history of thought]], some thinkers conceptualized a single world (Plato, Aristotle, [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]]), while others instead speculated on the existence of a series of worlds, continuous or non-continuous ([[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Empedocles]] and [[Diogenes Apolloniates|Diogenes]]).

===Meteorological phenomena===
Anaximander attributed some phenomena, such as [[thunder]] and [[lightning]], to the intervention of elements, rather than to divine causes.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Plutarch (III, 3):

: "Anaximander claims that all this is done by the wind, for when it happens to be enclosed in a thick cloud, then by its subtlety and lightness, the rupture produces the sound; and the scattering, because of the darkness of the cloud, creates the light."&lt;/ref&gt; In his system, thunder results from the shock of clouds hitting each other; the loudness of the sound is proportionate with that of the shock. Thunder without lightning is the result of the wind being too weak to emit any flame, but strong enough to produce a sound. A flash of lightning without thunder is a jolt of the air that disperses and falls, allowing a less active fire to break free. Thunderbolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air flow.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Naturales quaestiones'' (II, 18).&lt;/ref&gt;

He saw the sea as a remnant of the mass of humidity that once surrounded Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Plutarch (III, 16)&lt;/ref&gt; A part of that mass [[Evaporation|evaporated]] under the sun's action, thus causing the winds and even the rotation of the celestial bodies, which he believed were attracted to places where water is more abundant.&lt;ref&gt;It is then very likely that by observing the moon and the tides, Anaximander thought the latter were the cause, and not the effect of the satellite's movement.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained rain as a product of the humidity pumped up from Earth by the sun.&lt;ref name="Refutation" /&gt; For him, the Earth was slowly drying up and water only remained in the deepest regions, which someday would go dry as well. According to Aristotle's ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'' (II, 3), Democritus also shared this opinion.

===Origin of humankind===
Anaximander speculated about the beginnings and [[Evolution|origin]] of animal life. Taking into account the existence of fossils {{Dubious|date=December 2015}}, he claimed that animals sprang out of the sea long ago. The first animals were born trapped in a spiny bark, but as they got older, the bark would dry up and break.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Plutarch (V, 19)&lt;/ref&gt; As the early humidity evaporated, dry land emerged and, in time, humankind had to adapt. The 3rd century Roman writer [[Censorinus]] reports:

{{quote|text=Anaximander of Miletus considered that from warmed up water and earth emerged either fish or entirely fishlike animals. Inside these animals, men took form and embryos were held prisoners until puberty; only then, after these animals burst open, could men and women come out, now able to feed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Censorinus, ''De Die Natali'', IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Anaximander put forward the idea that humans had to spend part of this transition inside the mouths of big fish to protect themselves from the Earth's climate until they could come out in open air and lose their scales.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]] also mentions Anaximander's theory that humans were born inside fish, feeding like sharks, and that when they could defend themselves, they were thrown ashore to live on dry land.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that, considering humans' extended infancy, we could not have survived in the primeval world in the same manner we do presently.

==Other accomplishments==

===Cartography===
[[Image:Anaximander world map-en.svg|thumb|right|280px|Possible rendering of Anaximander's world map&lt;ref&gt;According to John Mansley Robinson, ''An Introduction to Early Greek Philosophy'', Houghton and Mifflin, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Both [[Strabo]] and [[Agathemerus]] (later Greek geographers) claim that, according to the geographer [[Eratosthenes]], Anaximander was the first to publish a map of the world. The map probably inspired the Greek historian [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] to draw a more accurate version. Strabo viewed both as the first geographers after [[Homer]].

Maps were produced in ancient times, also notably in [[Egypt]], [[Lydia]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Babylon]]. Only some small examples survived until today. The unique example of a world map comes from late Babylonian tablet [[Babylonian Map of the World|BM 92687]] later than 9th century BC but is based probably on a much older map. These maps indicated directions, roads, towns, borders, and geological features. Anaximander's innovation was to represent the entire inhabited land known to the ancient Greeks.

Such an accomplishment is more significant than it at first appears. Anaximander most likely drew this map for three reasons.&lt;ref&gt;As established by Marcel Conche, ''Anaximandre. Fragments et témoignages'', introduction (p.&amp;nbsp;43–47).&lt;/ref&gt; First, it could be used to improve navigation and trade between [[Miletus]]'s colonies and other colonies around the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Second, [[Thales]] would probably have found it easier to convince the Ionian [[Polis|city-states]] to join in a federation in order to push the [[Medes|Median]] threat away if he possessed such a tool. Finally, the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one.

Surely aware of the sea's convexity, he may have designed his map on a slightly rounded metal surface. The centre or “navel” of the world ({{lang|grc|ὀμφαλός γῆς}} ''omphalós gẽs'') could have been [[Delphi]], but is more likely in Anaximander's time to have been located near Miletus. The [[Aegean Sea]] was near the map's centre and enclosed by three continents, themselves located in the middle of the ocean and isolated like islands by sea and rivers. [[Europe]] was bordered on the south by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and was separated from [[Asia]] by the Black Sea, the [[Sea of Azov|Lake Maeotis]], and, further east, either by the [[Rioni River|Phasis River]] (now called the Rioni) or the [[Tanais]]. The [[Nile]] flowed south into the ocean, separating [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] (which was the name for the part of the then-known [[Africa]]n continent) from Asia.

===Gnomon===
The ''[[Suda]]'' relates that Anaximander explained some basic notions of geometry. It also mentions his interest in the measurement of time and associates him with the introduction in [[Greece]] of the gnomon. In [[Lacedaemon]], he participated in the construction, or at least in the adjustment, of [[sundial]]s to indicate [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es.&lt;ref&gt;These accomplishments are often attributed to him, notably by Diogenes Laertius (II, 1) and by the Roman historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Preparation for the Gospel]]'' (X, 14, 11).&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a gnomon required adjustments from a place to another because of the difference in latitude.

In his time, the gnomon was simply a vertical pillar or rod mounted on a horizontal plane. The position of its shadow on the plane indicated the time of day. As it moves through its apparent course, the sun draws a curve with the tip of the projected shadow, which is shortest at noon, when pointing due south. The variation in the tip's position at noon indicates the solar time and the seasons; the shadow is longest on the winter solstice and shortest on the summer solstice.

The invention of the gnomon itself cannot be attributed to Anaximander because its use, as well as the division of days into twelve parts, came from the [[Babylonia]]ns. It is they, according to [[Herodotus]]' [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] (II, 109), who gave the Greeks the art of time measurement. It is likely that he was not the first to determine the solstices, because no calculation is necessary. On the other hand, equinoxes do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during solstices, as the Babylonians thought. As the ''Suda'' seems to suggest, it is very likely that with his knowledge of geometry, he became the first Greek to accurately determine the equinoxes.

===Prediction of an earthquake===
In his philosophical work [[De Divinatione]] (I, 50, 112), Cicero states that Anaximander convinced the inhabitants of [[Lacedaemon]] to abandon their city and spend the night in the country with their weapons because an earthquake was near.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/divinatione1.shtml ''Da Divinatione'' (in Latin)]&lt;/ref&gt; The city collapsed when the top of the [[Taygetus]] split like the stern of a ship. Pliny the Elder also mentions this anecdote (II, 81), suggesting that it came from an "admirable inspiration", as opposed to Cicero, who did not associate the prediction with divination.

==Interpretations==
[[Bertrand Russell]] in the ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'' interprets Anaximander's theories as &lt;!-- the above quote as | CLARIFY: probably due to editing, the quote referenced here is unclear. --&gt; an assertion of the necessity of an appropriate balance between earth, fire, and water, all of which may be independently seeking to aggrandize their proportions relative to the others. Anaximander seems to express his belief that a natural order ensures balance between these elements, that where there was fire, ashes (earth) now exist.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy and Its Connection with Political and Social Circumstances from the Earliest Times to the Present Day'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1946).&lt;/ref&gt; His Greek peers echoed this sentiment with their belief in natural boundaries beyond which not even the gods could operate.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist who asserted that the primal being of the world was a state of indefiniteness. In accordance with this, anything definite has to eventually pass back into indefiniteness. In other words, Anaximander viewed "...all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance". (''Ibid.'', § 4) The world of individual objects, in this way of thinking, has no worth and should perish.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, ''Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks'' (Washington, D.C.: Regnery Gateway, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Heidegger]] lectured extensively on Anaximander, and delivered a lecture entitled "Anaximander's Saying" which was subsequently included in ''Off the Beaten Track''. The lecture examines the ontological difference and the oblivion of Being or ''[[Dasein]]'' in the context of the Anaximander fragment.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Off the Beaten Track'' (Cambridge &amp; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger's lecture is, in turn, an important influence on the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jacques Derrida, ''Margins of Philosophy'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), pp. 66–7; Derrida, "''Geschlecht'' II: Heidegger's Hand," in [[John Sallis]] (ed.), ''Deconstruction and Philosophy'' (Chicago &amp; London: University of Chicago Press, 1987), pp. 181–2; Derrida, ''Given Time: I. Counterfeit Money'' (Chicago &amp; London: University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 159, n. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
According to the ''Suda'':&lt;ref&gt;Themistius and Simplicius also mention some work "on nature". The list could refer to book titles or simply their topics. Again, no one can tell because there is no punctuation sign in Ancient Greek. Furthermore, this list is incomplete since the ''Suda'' ends it with {{lang|grc|ἄλλα τινά}}, thus implying "other works".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrés Ortiz-Osés''' (born 1943, [[Tardienta]]) is a Spanish [[philosopher]]. He studied [[theology]] in [[Comillas]] and [[Rome]] and then moved to The Institute of Philosophy in [[Innsbruck]] where he earned a Ph.D in [[hermeneutics]].

In Innsbruck he attended the lessons of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] and [[Coreth]]. He was a member of the [[Eranos]] group, inspired by [[C.G. Jung]]. Other members of Eranos have been [[Joseph Campbell]], [[Karl Kerenyi]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]], [[Gilbert Durand]], and [[James Hillman]].

He has been the main introductor of [[Jungian]] theories in the Spanish and Latin American intellectual scene. Currently he is a professor of hermeneutics at the [[University of Deusto]] in [[Bilbao]].  He is the author of more than thirty books and is the founder of the [[symbolic hermeneutics]], a philosophical trend that gave a symbolic twist to  north European hermeneutics.

'''Ataptatanū''' ([[Sanskrit]]:अतप्ततनू) – ''tapa'' (तप) means – 'to burn', 'heat up'; ''atapta'' (अतप्त) – means - 'not heated', 'cool', and ''tanū'' (तनू) – means - 'body', 'the physical self';  ''ataptatanū'' means – 'he whose body or mass is not prepared in fire', 'raw' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monier-Williams Sabskrit-English Dictionary|url= http://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/3.html }},&lt;/ref&gt;

The compound word, ''ataptatanū'', appears in the below cited mantra of the IX Mandala of the Rig Veda. In a [[sukta]] addressed to Pavmāna Somo Devatā, Rishi Pavitra prays:-

:पवित्रं ते विततं ब्रह्मणस्पते प्रभुर्गात्राणि पर्येषि विश्वतः |
:अतप्ततनूर्न तदामो अश्नुते श्रृतास इद्वहन्तस्तत्समाशत ||   ([[Rig Veda]] IX.83.1) 

In this mantra, ''ataptatanūh'', refers to the one who has not subjected himself to the heat of tapas, ''tadāmah'' refers to one who is raw and who therefore, ''aśunate'' - cannot experience the highest bliss because his body is not yet properly prepared to receive the knowledge he seeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda with commentary in Hindi of Swami Dayananda Saraswati|publisher=Arya Samaj, Jamnagar|page=272|url=http://www.aryasamajjamnagar.org/rugveda_v5/rugveda.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Satyarth Prakash]] (Light of Truth), Swami [[Dayananda Saraswati]] explains that ''ataptatanū'' does not refer to branding with fire of one’s body which fact is clarified by Rishi Pavitra in the subsequent mantra which reads:-

:तपोष्पवित्रं विततं दिवस्पदे शोचन्तो अस्य तन्तवो वयस्थिरन् |
:अवन्त्यस्य पवीतारमाशवो दिवस्पृष्ठमधि तिष्ठन्ति चेतसा ||

and which means –

: " O Lord Thou Who art the Protector of the universe and the Veda, and art Omnipotent, Omnipresent, and Holy in nature canst not be approached by a human soul that has not been purified by tapa (or tapasya by means of thorough control of the senses, truthful speech, subjugation of the animal in man (instinct), conquest of the lower self, the practice of yoga, association with good men – all these constitute tapasya), and is therefore, not spiritually regenerate; it is only those, whose souls have been cleansed through righteous conduct and devotion to virtue, that can see Thee Who art All Holy. " ([[Rig Veda]] IX.83.2) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Light of Truth-Satyarth Prakash|author=Dayananda Saeaswati|publisher=Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha|page=369|url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/250453797/359/PAGE-369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapa]] or ''tapasya'', is practical discipline; according to the [[Bhagavada Gita]] (XVII.14), revering the gods, the twice-born, elders, teachers and wise men, purity, celibacy, and non-violence these are the ''tapasya'' of the body, of speech and of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita|publisher=Islamkotob|page=240|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=b387bE4Ok0oC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=tapasya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zh2xVJmYNoKauQSkn4D4Dw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tapasya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The finishing phase of a scholar’s higher education was called ''tapasya'' in the time of [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Krishna Charitra|author=Alo Shome|publisher=V&amp;amp;S publishers|page=55|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ASNmhKlL0ioC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=tapasya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7CKxVLTfHYayuASjr4CQAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tapasya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gandhi]] considered ''tapasya'' to be the test of love, ''[[ahimsa]]'', self-suffering and self-sacrifice, essentials in the quest for truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=wisdom in Action|author=Raghavan Iyer|publisher=Theosophy Trust|page=254|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=SrmqJTBK_f4C&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=tapasya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uCSxVLCWM8aLuASxk4KQDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tapasya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3627">'''Camil Petrescu''' ({{IPA-ro|kaˈmil peˈtresku}}; 22 April 1894 – 14 May 1957; born and died in [[Bucharest]]) was a Romanian [[playwright]], [[novelist]], [[philosopher]] and [[poet]]. He marked the end of the traditional novel era and laid the foundation of the modern novel era.

== Life ==
Camil Petrescu lost both his parents early in life and was raised by a relative (or a nanny from the Moşilor suburb; the sources remain quite unclear on this).

Petrescu went to primary school at [[Obor]], and to high school at [[Saint Sava National College]], where he wrote his very first poem. Being very poor, he studied assiduously, worked to support himself, and relatively late—at the age of 29—he began his studies in philosophy at the [[University of Bucharest]]. His antisemitism is controversial, having Jewish friends such as [[Mihail Sebastian]] .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/sebastian-applebaum-2236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/rghl_01/rghl_01_00383.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1902/19020770.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, Petrescu was drafted and sent to the battlefields of then raging [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|World War I]], where he was wounded and taken prisoner by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarians]]. Freed in 1918, he depicted his war experiences in his 1930 novel ''[[Ultima noapte de dragoste, întâia noapte de război]]'' ("The Last Night of Love, the First Night of War"). In 1933, Petrescu wrote the novel ''[[Patul lui Procust]]'' ("The Bed of Procrustes"). He was a teacher in [[Timişoara]], and director of the [[National Theater Bucharest]]. He was also a [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]] from 1947.

{{Descartes}}
'''Cartesian doubt''' is a form of '''methodological skepticism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; associated with the writings and methodology of [[René Descartes]] (1596{{ndash}}1650).&lt;ref name="Philosophical Glossary"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20010621215141/http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?Cartesian+doubt A Philosophical Glossary]" edited by Justin Leiber, Philosophy Department, University of Houston, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt; Cartesian doubt is also known as '''Cartesian skepticism''', '''methodic doubt''', '''methodological skepticism''', '''universal doubt''', '''systematic doubt''' or '''hyperbolic doubt'''.

Cartesian doubt is a systematic process of being skeptical about (or doubting) the truth of one's beliefs, which has become a characteristic method in [[philosophy]]. This method of doubt was largely popularized in Western philosophy by René Descartes, who sought to doubt the truth of all his beliefs in order to determine which beliefs he could be certain were true. It is the basis for Descartes' statement, "''[[Cogito ergo sum]]''" ("I think, therefore I am").

Methodological skepticism is distinguished from [[philosophical skepticism]] in that methodological skepticism is an approach that subjects all knowledge claims to scrutiny with the goal of sorting out true from false claims, whereas philosophical skepticism is an approach that questions the possibility of certain knowledge.

== Characteristics ==
Cartesian doubt is methodological. Its purpose is to use doubt as a route to certain knowledge by finding those things which could not be doubted. The fallibility of sense data in particular is a subject of Cartesian doubt.

There are several interpretations as to the objective of Descartes' skepticism. Prominent among these is a [[W:foundationalism|foundationalist]] account which claims that Descartes' skepticism is aimed at eliminating all belief which it is possible to doubt, thus leaving Descartes with only [[basic belief]]s (also known as foundational beliefs). From these indubitable basic beliefs, Descartes then attempts to derive further knowledge. It's an archetypal and significant example that epitomizes the [[Rationalism|Continental Rational]] schools of philosophy.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

== Technique ==
Descartes' method of hyperbolic doubt included:
# accepting only information you know to be true
# breaking down these truths into smaller units
# solving the simple problems first
# making ''complete'' lists of further ''problems''

Hyperbolic doubt means having the tendency to doubt, since it is an extreme or exaggerated form of doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Skirry (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; (Knowledge in the Cartesian sense means to know something beyond not merely all reasonable, but all possible, doubt.) In his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' (1641), Descartes resolved to systematically doubt that any of his beliefs were true, in order to build, from the ground up, a belief system consisting of only certainly true beliefs; his end goal—or a major one, at the least—was to find an undoubtable basis for the sciences. Consider Descartes' opening lines of the ''Meditations'':

{{Quotation | Several years have now elapsed since I first became aware that I had accepted, even from my youth, many false opinions for true, and that consequently what I afterward based on such principles was highly doubtful; and from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking once in my life to rid myself of all the opinions I had adopted, and of commencing anew the work of building from the foundation... | René Descartes | Meditation I'', 1641}}

== Descartes's method ==
René Descartes, the originator of Cartesian doubt, put all beliefs, ideas, thoughts, and matter in doubt. He showed that his grounds, or reasoning, for any knowledge could just as well be false. Sensory experience, the primary mode of knowledge, is often erroneous and therefore must be doubted. For instance, what one is seeing may very well be a [[hallucination]]. There is nothing that proves it cannot be. In short, if there is any way a belief can be disproved, then its grounds are insufficient. From this, Descartes proposed two arguments, the dream and the demon.&lt;ref name="Scruton"&gt;[[Roger Scruton]]. ''Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey''.

=== The dream argument ===
{{See also|Dream argument}}

Descartes, knowing that the context of our dreams, while possibly unbelievable, are often lifelike, hypothesized that humans can only believe that they are awake. There are no sufficient grounds by which to distinguish a dream experience from a waking experience. For instance, Subject A sits at the computer, typing this article. Just as much evidence exists to indicate that the act of composing this article is reality as there is evidence to demonstrate the opposite. Descartes conceded that we live in a world that can create such ideas as dreams. However, by the end of ''The Meditations'', he concludes that we can distinguish dream from reality at least in retrospect:&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"But when I distinctly see where things come from and where and when they come to me, and when I can connect my perceptions of them with my whole life without a break then I can be certain that when I encounter these things  I am not asleep but awake." &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;— Descartes: Selected Philosophical Writings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tNxSphqAYkC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=%22But+when+I+distinctly+see+where+things+come+from+and%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5_iRLDxEc-&amp;sig=4qw-RoWL9GPSHQvlI4cgzBEC1pw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjIkbHR9o_dAhUBUK0KHf07DMcQ6AEwAnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22But%20when%20I%20distinctly%20see%20where%20things%20come%20from%20and%22&amp;f=false|title=Descartes: Selected Philosophical Writings|last=Descartes|first=René|date=1988-02-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521358125|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Evil Demon ===

{{Main|Evil demon}}

Descartes reasoned that our very own experience may very well be controlled by an ''evil demon'' of sorts. This demon is as clever and deceitful as he is powerful. He could have created a superficial world that we may think we live in.&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt; As a result of this doubt, sometimes termed the Malicious Demon Hypothesis, Descartes found that he was unable to trust even the simplest of his perceptions.

In ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy#Meditation I: Concerning Those Things That Can Be Called into Doubt|Meditation I]]'', Descartes stated that if one were mad, even briefly, the insanity might have driven  man into believing that what we thought was true could be merely our minds deceiving us. He also stated that there could be '[[evil demon|some malicious, powerful, cunning demon]]' that had deceived us, preventing us from judging correctly.

Descartes argued that all his senses were lying and since your senses can easily fool you, his idea of an infinitely powerful being must be true as that idea could have only been put there by an infinitely powerful being which would have no reason to be deceitful to him.

== I think, therefore I am ==

While methodic doubt has a nature, one need not hold that knowledge is impossible in order to apply the method of doubt.  Indeed, Descartes' attempt to apply the method of doubt to the existence of himself spawned the proof of his famous saying, "''[[Cogito, ergo sum]]''" (I think, therefore I am).  That is, Descartes tried to doubt his own existence, but found that even his doubting showed that he existed, since he could not doubt if he did not exist.&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7562">The [[Catholic Charismatic Renewal]] is a recent movement in the Catholic Church to re-emphasize the [[charism]]s of the [[Holy Spirit]] in [[Laity|lay people]]'s everyday lives.

== History ==
The majority of Latin Americans are Catholics. About 84% of the people would say that they were raised Catholic, though only 69% of the population are Catholic today. The 15% decline is mostly due to the spread of [[Pentecostalism]] in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion in Latin America." Pew Research Centers Religion Public Life Project RSS. November 12, 2014. Accessed May 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Pentecostalism, the Charismatic Catholic Renewal began in the United States. This lay movement began in the 1960s after inspiration of people converting to Pentecostalism and other Protestant denominations. This renewal is to re-emphasize the charisms of the Holy Spirit found in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] in the New Testament of the Bible. Today there are 73 million Catholic Charismatics in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Rise of Charismatic Catholicism in Latin America|last = Cleary|first = Edward L.|publisher = University Press of Florida|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Gainesville, FL|pages = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
Brazil's Catholic Charismatic Renewal began in the 1960s when Jesuit priests [[Eduardo Dougherty|Edward Dougherty]] and [[Harold Rahm]] departed the United States for Brazil. In the early 1970s, while Rahm was calling on the Holy Spirit for the gift of healing people of addictions and other sorts of things, Edward Dougherty was holding retreats. These retreats were called "Experience of Holy Spirit" or "Experience of Prayer." These charismatic retreats emphasized the Holy Spirit. The retreats were then handed over to the lay people of the Catholic Church. In 1979, Dougtery founded Associacao de Señor Jesus (Association of the Lord Jesus) to produce mass media similar to the Pentecostal's. 70,000 member contributors helped fund it. By the 1990s, the movement became popular for university students.

Covenant communities had a huge impact on the spread of Pentecostalism in Brazil. covenant communities were established for people drawn to the movement in strong ways. They were for living in structure with other charismatics looking for encouragement, spiritual direction, and guidance in how to live out their new lives. In 1998 there were about 50 in Brazil. By 2008 that number increased to 300. One of the more popular ones is the New Song community. They provide a TV and radio station for the movement.

Brazil's Charismatic Catholic Mega Church is [[Cachoeira Paulista]]. It is the largest Catholic Church in Latin American. Located between Rio and São Paulo in the Paraiba Valley, this church can hold 100,000 people and has 60,000 people coming weekly.

Brazil's approach to the Catholic Charismatic Renewal is to embrace popular culture.

=== Mexico ===
Due to 88% of the country of Mexico being Catholic, it was not too difficult for the Catholic Charismatic Renewal to gain support by the bishops. Lay people soon followed. The First Latin American Charismatic Conference was held in 1973. Prior to this movement in Mexico, the Renovation Movement of Catholic Charismatics in the Holy Spirit had already been spreading. Like Brazil, Mexico had multiple covenant communities which began appearing around 1980. By 2007, there were 27 covenant communities. The main focus on this movement in Brazil is evangelization.

=== Colombia ===
In Colombia, the Catholic Charismatic Movement began in [[Minuto de Dios]] as an effort by activist priests in the early 1970s. These people are the lowest social class and priests let them know they are not forgotten. Colombia's spread is influenced by the incorporation of social justice. This confronts the Pentecostal growth in the country.

=== Dominican Republic ===
The Dominican Republic is regarded as one of the most intensively Charismatic Catholic countries. The movement was accepted by lay people and church hierarchy alike with ease.

=== Guatemala ===
The Catholic streams of the Charismatic Catholic renewal began in Guatemala with [[Francis MacNutt|Fr. Francis McNutt]] who visited in 1970 with [http://www.tommytyson.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 Tommy Tyson], Chaplain at ORU, and [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/27/obituaries/ruth-carter-stapleton-dies-evangelist-and-faith-healer.html Ruth Carter Stapleton].  About 60 clerics and a few lay persons were impacted, leaving Sor Cecilia a nun with the task of renewal.  Later in the home of Catholic Dorothy Asturias, a small band of people gathered.  Stella Salazar, half sister to the former President of Guatemala [[Jorge Serrano Elías]], was praying for God to release her son from prison in Chicago.  Eugene Harshbarger, and Gladys, from the American Doughnuts and former CIA officer were part of this group.  Visits from Enoch Christoffersen of the [[Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International|Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship]] added members as more and more people were added.  Pepe Garces now owner of NAIS Restaurants was an early adherent, as well as Regina Broll, who would become the President of [[Aglow International|Women's Aglow International]].  Tim Rovenstine and Roberta, in their home at Dos Alicias, would hand over their small flock to the group that was formed called [http://verbo.org/history/ Ministerios El Verbo].  Dr. Andres Carrodegua who later become a scholar who did a major contribution in Bible Research.

'''Christopher Arthur Bruce Peacocke''' (born 22 May 1950) is a British philosopher known for his work in [[philosophy of mind]] and [[epistemology]].  His recent publications, in the field of epistemology, have defended a version of rationalism.

== Biography ==

Son of the British theologian and biochemist [[Arthur Peacocke]], he was educated at [[Magdalen College School, Oxford]], and [[Exeter College, Oxford]], where he read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] as an undergraduate, winning both the Webb Medley Prize in Economics and the Henry Wilde Prize in Philosophy in 1971, and graduated with a first class degree. Later that year he was awarded a [[Kennedy Memorial Trust]] scholarship to study at [[Harvard University]]. He then continued at Oxford gaining a BPhil (1974) and DPhil (1979) in Philosophy, the latter under the supervision of [[Michael Dummett]]. He was Visiting Lecturer at [[University of California, Berkeley]], 1975-6, and in 1975 elected to a fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]]. He was the [[Susan Stebbing]] Professor of Philosophy at [[King's College London]] from 1985 to 1989 and [[Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy]] at [[Oxford University]] from 1989 to 2000, at which time he moved to [[New York University]] (NYU). He joined the Philosophy Department at [[Columbia University]] in 2004, where he is now Johnsonian Professor of Philosophy. In 2007 he was named to the [[Richard Wollheim]] chair in philosophy at [[University College, London]], where he taught in the third (summer) term each year until 2015. He lives with his wife and two children. He is also Visiting Professor of Philosophy at [[New College of the Humanities]].&lt;ref name="New College of the Humanities Website"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nchum.org/blog/christopher-peacocke-joins-new-college-humanities-visiting-professor |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150317114133/https://www.nchum.org/blog/christopher-peacocke-joins-new-college-humanities-visiting-professor |archivedate=17 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nchum.org/faculty/professor-christopher-peacocke |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150317114133/https://www.nchum.org/faculty/professor-christopher-peacocke |archivedate=17 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical work ==

Of his earlier work, he is perhaps best known for the first chapter of his 1983 book, ''Sense and Content'', entitled "Sensation and the Content of Experience." In this chapter, Peacocke defends the claim that perceptual experience, over and above its intentional content, has certain "sensational properties". He gives three different examples of visual scenarios where intentional content alone cannot capture every aspect of the experience. Those aspects which elude intentional content are thought to be the sensational properties of the experience. Some of those who defend [[qualia]] have used these examples as evidence of their existence. Several philosophers have criticized these examples ([[Michael Tye (philosopher)|Michael Tye]], [[Fred Dretske]]), claiming that the supposed extra quality can indeed be captured in terms of intentional content.

In ''Sense and Content'', Peacocke assumed that the intentional content of mental states is exclusively conceptual content, i.e. the content is such that the subject of the state needs to possess all the concepts that specify the intentional content in question. From about 1986 and onwards, Peacocke abandoned this assumption, arguing that some mental states, in particular perceptual experiences and representational states implicated in subpersonal information processing (for example, in the subconscious parsing of heard speech), have non-conceptual intentional content. Peacocke is now often seen as a leading proponent of this notion of non-conceptual intentional content.

In his 1992 book ''A Study of Concepts'', Peacocke gives a detailed exposition of a philosophical theory of concept possession, according to which the nature and identity conditions for concepts may be given, in a non-circular way, by the conditions a thinker has to satisfy in order to possess the relevant concepts. The theory is a version of a so-called "conceptual" or "inferential role" theory of concepts.

'''Conservation''' is an [[ethic]] of resource use, allocation, and protection. Its primary focus is upon maintaining the health of the [[Natural environment|natural world]], its [[fishery|fisheries]], [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]], and [[biological diversity]]. Secondary focus is on material conservation, including [[non-renewable resources]] such as metals, minerals and [[fossil fuels]], and [[energy conservation]], which is important to protect the natural world. Those who follow the conservation ethic and, especially, those who advocate or work toward conservation goals are termed [[Conservation movement|conservationists]].

The terms ''conservation'' and ''preservation'' are frequently conflated outside the academic, scientific, and professional kinds of literature. The US National Park Service offers the following explanation of the important ways in which these two terms represent very different conceptions of environmental protection ethics:

″Conservation and preservation are closely linked and may indeed seem to mean the same thing. Both terms involve a degree of protection, but how that protection is carried out is the key difference. Conservation is generally associated with the protection of natural resources, while preservation is associated with the protection of buildings, objects, and landscapes. Put simply, ''conservation seeks the proper use of nature, while preservation seeks protection of nature from use''.

During the [[environmentalism|environmental movement]] of the early 20th century, two opposing factions emerged: conservationists and preservationists. Conservationists sought to regulate human use while preservationists sought to eliminate human impact altogether.″&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/klgo/learn/education/classrooms/conservation-vs-preservation.htm National Park Service: Conservation versus preservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
To [[habitat conservation|conserve habitat]] in [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s and to stop [[deforestation]] is a goal widely shared by many groups with a wide variety of motivations.

To protect sea life from [[extinction]] due to [[overfishing]] or [[climate change]] is another commonly stated goal of conservation – ensuring that "some will be available for future generations" to continue a way of life.

The consumer conservation ethic is sometimes expressed by the ''four R's'': " Rethink, Reduce, Recycle, Repair"
This social ethic primarily relates to [[local purchasing]], [[moral purchasing]], the [[sustainability|sustained]], and efficient use of [[renewable resource]]s, the moderation of destructive use of finite resources, and the prevention of harm to common resources such as [[air pollution|air]] and [[water pollution|water]] quality, the natural functions of a living earth, and cultural values in a [[built environment]].

The principal value underlying most expressions of the conservation ethic is that the natural world has intrinsic and intangible worth along with utilitarian value – a view carried forward by the scientific [[conservation movement]] and some of the older [[Romanticism|Romantic]] schools of [[ecology movement]].

More [[utilitarian ethics|Utilitarian]] schools of conservation seek a proper valuation of [[Human impact on the environment|local and global impacts of human activity]] upon nature in their effect upon human [[measuring well-being|well being]], now and to posterity. How such values are assessed and exchanged among people determines the social, political, and personal restraints and imperatives by which conservation is practiced. This is a view common in the modern [[environmental movement]].

These movements have diverged but they have deep and common roots in the [[conservation movement]].

In the United States of America, the year 1864 saw the publication of two books which laid the foundation for Romantic and Utilitarian conservation traditions in America. The posthumous publication of [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden]]'' established the grandeur of unspoiled nature as a citadel to nourish the spirit of man. From [[George Perkins Marsh]] a very different book, ''[[Man and Nature]]'', later subtitled "The Earth as Modified by Human Action", catalogued his observations of man exhausting and altering the land from which his sustenance derives.

|width=25%
|align=right}}

In common usage, the term refers to the activity of systematically protecting natural resources such as forests, including biological diversity. [[Carl F. Jordan]] defines the term as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jordan |first=Carl|title=Replacing Quantity With Quality As a Goal for Global Management|publisher=Wiley |date=1995|isbn=0-471-59515-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|biological '''conservation''' as being a philosophy of managing the environment in a manner that does not despoil, exhaust or extinguish.}}

While this usage is not new, the idea of biological conservation has been applied to the principles of ecology, [[bio geography]], [[anthropology]], economy and sociology to maintain  [[biodiversity]].

The term "conservation" itself may cover the concepts such as [[cultural diversity]], [[genetic diversity]] and the concept of movements [[environmental conservation]], [[seedbank]] (preservation of seeds). These are often summarized as the priority to [[respect diversity]], especially by [[Green movement|Greens]].

Much recent movement in conservation can be considered a resistance to [[commercialism]] and [[globalization]]. [[Slow Food]] is a consequence of rejecting these as moral priorities, and embracing a [[voluntary simplicity|slower and more locally focused lifestyle]].

Distinct trends exist regarding conservation development. While many countries' efforts to preserve [[species]] and their [[habitats]] have been government-led, those in the North Western Europe tended to arise out of the middle-class and aristocratic interest in [[natural history]], expressed at the level of the individual and the national, regional or local [[learned society]]. Thus countries like Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, etc. had what we would today term [[NGOs]] – in the shape of the [[RSPB]], [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and County Naturalists' Trusts (dating back to 1889, 1895 and 1912 respectively) Natuurmonumenten, Provincial Conservation Trusts for each Dutch province, Vogelbescherming, etc. – a long time before there were [[national parks]] and [[national nature reserve]]s. This in part reflects the absence of wilderness areas in heavily cultivated Europe, as well as a longstanding interest in [[laissez-faire]] government in some countries, like the UK, leaving it as no coincidence that [[John Muir]], the Scottish-born founder of the National Park movement (and hence of government-sponsored conservation) did his sterling work in the USA, where he was the motor force behind the establishment of such NPs as [[Yosemite]] and [[Yellowstone]]. Nowadays, officially more than 10 percent of the world is legally protected in some way or the other, and in practice, private fundraising is insufficient to pay for the effective management of so much land with protective status.

Protected areas in developing countries, where probably as many as 70–80 percent of the species of the world live, still enjoy very little effective management and protection. Some countries, such as Mexico, have non-profit civil organizations and landowners dedicated to protecting vast private property, such is the case of Hacienda Chichen's Maya Jungle Reserve and Bird Refuge&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haciendachichen.com/eco-design.htm Haciendachichen.com], "The Importance of Eco-Design"&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Chichen Itza]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]. The Adopt A Ranger Foundation has calculated that worldwide about 140,000 rangers are needed for the protected areas in developing and transition countries. There are no data on how many rangers are employed at the moment, but probably less than half the protected areas in developing and transition countries have any rangers at all and those that have them are at least 50% short This means that there would be a worldwide ranger deficit of 105,000 rangers in the developing and transition countries.

One of the world's foremost conservationists, Dr.Kenton Miller, stated about the importance of Rangers: "The future of our [[ecosystem services]] and our heritage depends upon park rangers. With the rapidity at which the challenges to protected areas are both changing and increasing, there has never been more of a need for well-prepared human capacity to manage. Park rangers are the backbone of park management. They are on the ground. They work on the front line with scientists, visitors, and members of local communities."

Adopt A Ranger,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adopt-a-ranger.org Adopt-a-ranger.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703033240/http://www.adopt-a-ranger.org/ |date=3 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fears that the ranger deficit is the greatest single limiting factor in effectively conserving nature in 75% of the world. Currently, no conservation organization or western country or international organization addresses this problem. Adopt A Ranger has been incorporated to draw worldwide public attention to the most urgent problem that conservation is facing in developing and transition countries: protected areas without field staff. Very specifically, it will contribute to solving the problem by fundraising to finance rangers in the field. It will also help governments in developing and transition countries to assess realistic staffing needs and staffing strategies.

Others, including [[Survival International]], have advocated instead for cooperation with local tribal peoples, who are natural allies of the conservation movement and can provide cost-effective protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivalinternational.org/conservation Tribal Conservationists]&lt;/ref&gt;

The prisoner would typically be forced to do 6,000–14,400 revolutions over the period of six hours per day (1.5–3.6 seconds per revolution), and the warden could make the task harder by tightening an adjusting screw, hence the slang term "screw" for prison warden.

The term '''equative''' is used in [[linguistics]] to refer to constructions where two entities are equated with each other. For example, the sentence ''Susan is our president'', equates two entities "Susan" and "our president". In English, equatives are typically expressed using a [[Copula (linguistics)|copular verb]] such as "be", although this is not the only use of this verb. Equatives can be contrasted with [[Predicate (grammar)|predicative]] constructions where one entity is identified as a member of a set, such as ''Susan is a president.'' 

Different world languages approach equatives in different ways. The major difference between languages is whether or not they use a [[Copula (linguistics)|copular]] verb or a non-verbal element (e.g. [[demonstrative pronoun]]) to equate the two expressions. 

The term ''equative'' is also sometimes applied to comparative-like constructions in which the degrees compared are identical rather than distinct: e.g., ''John is as stupid as he is fat''; some languages have a separate [[equative case]].

== Theories and debate ==

=== Debate on taxonomy ===

The [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] or classification of copular clauses proposed by Higgins is the starting point of much work on syntax and semantics of [[Copula (linguistics)|copular clauses]]. Higgins' taxonomy distinguishes between four types of copular clauses:

* Predicational
 a. The hat is big.
 b. The hat/present/thing I bought for Harvey is big.
 c. What I bought for Harvey is big.

* Specificational
 a. The director of ''Anatomy of Murder'' is Otto Preminger.
 b. The only director/person/one I met was Otto Preminger.
 c. Who I met was Otto Preminger.

* Identificational
 a. That (woman) is Sylvia.
 b. That (stuff) is DDT.

* Equative
 a. Sylvia Obernauer is HER.
 b. Cicero is Tully.

This taxonomy is based primarily on native speaker intuition, as well as on detailed observations of English copular sentences. The intuition about predicational clauses is that they predicate a property of the subject [[referent]]. The other three types of copular clauses do not involve predication. Equatives equate the referents of the two expressions on either side of the copular verb. Neither is a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] of the other. Specificational clauses involve assigning a value to a variable: the subject expression sets up a variable and the post-copular expression provides the value for that variable. Identificational clauses typically involve a demonstrative subject and are used for teaching the names of people or of things. Many linguists are currently in disagreement regarding the taxonomy and status of equative clauses.

=== Reduction of taxonomy ===

Caroline Heycock &lt;ref&gt;Heycock, C. (2012). Specification, equation, and agreement in copular sentences. The Canadian Journal of Linguistics/La revue canadienne de linguistique, 57(2), 209-240.&lt;/ref&gt; contributes to the discussion about whether specificational sentences are a special type of equatives or if they can be reduced to 'inverted predications': she argues that these sentences are a type of equative in which only one of the two noun phrases is a simple individual. Heycock claims that specificational sentences are an 'asymmetric' equation because the noun phrase that occurs in clause-initial position is interpreted as a more intentional subject than is the post-copular noun phrase. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Den Dikken &lt;ref&gt;Den Dikken, M. (2006). Relators and linkers: The syntax of predication, predicate inversion, and copulas (Vol. 47). MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the category of specificational sentences is more real and that it includes both categories (specificational and equative clauses).
&lt;br /&gt; 
Mikkelsen, on the other hand, maintains the distinction between specificational and equative clauses, but suggests that the identificational class be eliminated.
&lt;br /&gt; 
Heller &lt;ref&gt;Heller, D. (2005). Identity and information: Semantic and pragmatic aspects of specificational sentences (Doctoral dissertation, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey).&lt;/ref&gt; goes further and gives a reduced taxonomy of two classes of clauses: predicational, which includes both identificational and predicational clauses, and equative, which involve equative and specificational clauses.

=== Debate on equatives ===

Linguists have also been arguing about the very existence of equative clauses as a separate class. There are languages that are claimed to lack equative constructions, e.g. Adger &amp; Ramchand &lt;ref&gt;Adger, D. (2003). Predication and equation. Linguistic Inquiry, 34(3), 325-359. doi:10.1162/002438903322247515&lt;/ref&gt; analyze Scottish Gaelic as a language without equatives. Some languages use more elaborate locutions, e.g. ''be the same person as'' in English to express the meaning of the sentence like ''Cicero is Tully.'' Geist &lt;ref&gt;Geist, L. (2007). Predication and equation in copular sentences: Russian vs. english. (pp. 79-105). Dordrecht: Springer Netherlands. doi:10.1007/978-1-4020-6197-4_3&lt;/ref&gt; claims that there are no monoclausal equatives in Russian. According to Geist, equation is mediated, syntactically and semantically, by a demonstrative pronoun. Mikkelsen argues that within English, outside special cases like Muhammad Ali is Cassius Clay, Mark Twain is Samuel CLemens, and Cicero is Tully, main clause equatives which involve two names are difficult to contextualize. However, equatives such as ''Sylvia Obernauer is HER'', where one NP is a pronoun and the other is a name, are easier to contextualize: they are natural answers to ''Who is who?'' in a situation where individuals can be identified both by name or by sight, e.g. at the conference.

=== Halliday's semantic analysis of equatives ===

Halliday &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M. A. K. (1968). Notes on transitivity and theme in English Part 3. Journal of linguistics, 4(02), 179-215.&lt;/ref&gt; divides clauses into two categories: 'intensive', where the process is [[ascription]] (the assigning of an attribute) and the equative, which is treated as a type of effective clause with the process being syntactically one of action rather than ascription. The intensive clause, like Mary is/seems happy, Mary was/became a teacher, is a non-reversible, one-participant type with the verb being of the copulative class ('class o': be, becomes, seem, look, sound, get, turn, etc.); the equative, like 'John is the leader', is a reversible, two-participant type with the verb being of the equative sub-class (of 'class 2': be, equal, resemble, realize, represent, etc.).
&lt;br /&gt;
The equative relates an 'identifier' with a 'thing to be identified', as in ('who is John?') // John is '''the leader''' //. This relates to the underlying WH-question, and either the identified or the identifier may come first in sequence. The equative has two interpretations, as decoding or as encoding: // John is the leader // as a decoding equative has the interpretation 'John realizes, has the function of the leader', with John as the variable and the leader as a value, and as an encoding equative has the interpretation' John is realized by, has the form of the leader', with John as value and the leader as variable. According to Halliday, all equative clauses are therefore ambiguous, for example:
 The noisiest ones are '''the freshmen'''.
 *Decoding: 'you notice those noisiest ones there? well they're freshmen'
 *Encoding: 'you want to know who makes the most noise? the freshmen do'
 
 What they're selling might be '''sports clothes'''.
 *Decoding: 'what are those things they're selling? they might be '''sports clothes''''
 *Encoding: 'what do they sell? they might sell sports clothes'

== Copular equative constructions ==

=== Chinese ===
[[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] Chinese exhibits both DP-DP and DP-CP structures, and it is classified as having copular equative construction because there is overt copula. The copular verb 是 ''shì'' can be used in both of these structures.

==== DP = DP ====
There is only one copular verb in Chinese, 是 ''shì'', which is used as an equative verb. This verb is necessary when the complement of the sentence is a noun phrase.
 (1) 我是中国人。 ''wǒ shì Zhōnggúorén.''
     I-NOM COP Chinese (person).
     'I am Chinese.'
In classical Chinese before the [[Han Dynasty]], the verb 是 served as a [[demonstrative pronoun]] meaning "this".&lt;ref&gt;Pulleyblank, Edwin G. (1995). Outline of Classical Chinese Grammar. Vancouver: UBC Press. {{ISBN|0-7748-0541-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In modern Chinese, the [[complementizer]] 的 ''de'' is needed at the end of a noun phrase that changes the category to an adjectival phrase. Consider the following two sentences:
 (2) a. *我的靴子是红色。 ''wǒde xuēzi shì hóngsè.''
        I-POSS GEN COP red (color).
        *'My boot(s) is(are) red.'
     b. 我的靴子是红色的。 ''wǒde xuēzi shì hóngsè de.''
        I-POSS GEN COP red (color) COMPL.
        'My boot(s) is(are) red.'
Whilst the two sentences aim to express the same meaning, only the second one is grammatical. The first cannot equate ’red' and 'boot(s)' without using the modifier 的 ''de''.

==== DP = CP ====
The example below illustrates how a DP can be equated with a CP clause by employing the copular verb 是 ''shì''.
 (3) 事实是他不好看。''shìshí shì tā bū hǎokàn.''
     Truth COP he-NOM NEG good-looking.
     'The truth is that he is not good-looking.'

=== English ===

==== DP = DP ====
Equative sentences resemble [[Predicative expression|predicative sentences]] in that they have two noun phrases and the copular verb ‘to be’. However, the similarity is superficial. Compare the following two sentences:
 (4) ''Cicero is Tully.''
 (5) ''Cicero is an orator and philosopher.''
Analysis of these sentences will show that there is a radical difference between the equative sentence and the predicational sentence in English. The predicational sentence in (5) ascribes the property to the referent noun phrase whereas the equative sentence basically says that the first and second noun phrase share the same referent. It is difficult to distinguish between a predicative and equative sentence in  English as both use a similar construction and both require the copular verb ‘to be’. Unlike specificational sentences, truly equative sentences cannot be analyzed as syntactically inverted predications, because neither expression is functioning as a predicate. Note that even English examples like (4) have predicational interpretations, as in a context where Tully is a character in a play, or where Tully refers to the property of being named Tully, rather than referring to the actual referent.

=== Haitian Creole ===

==== DP = DP ====
In [[Haitian Creole]] the equative clause pattern involves the equative copula ''sé'' which joins a subject noun phrase with a complement noun phrase that refers back to the subject. 
 (6) ''Misyé Pól  sé      vwézinaj   mwen.''
     ''Mr.   Paul Copula  neighbour  my''
     'Mr.Paul is my neighbour'

A simple copula predicate consists of ''sé'' 'am/is/are' only. The negative marker ''pa'' and the TMA (tense-mood-aspect) markers can co-occur with the copula-type predicate, subject to certain rules (TMA markers: ''té'' 'past' or 'anterior', ''kay'' 'prospective' or 'irrealis', ''ka'' 'nonpunctual', ''sa'' 'abilitative').  One such rule is that té + sé → sété (or just té without sé). The combinations permitted in an equative clause are limited in natural speech: a maximum number of two tense, mood, aspect and copula morphemes can co-occur in a given clause.&lt;ref&gt;Escure, G., &amp; Schwegler, A. (Eds.). (2004). Creoles, contact, and language change: Linguistic and social implications (Vol. 27). John Benjamins Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Here are some examples of the equative clause type in Haitian Creole (predicates are in bold):
 (7) ''Ou '''sé''' jan mwen.''        'You '''are''' my friend.'
     ''Ou '''té''' jan mwen.''        'You '''were''' my friend.'
     ''Ou '''kay''' jan mwen.''       'You '''will be''' my friend.'
     ''Ou '''pa té kay''' jan mwen.'' 'You '''wouldn't be''' my friend.'
     ''Ou '''sa''' jan mwen.''        'You '''can be''' my friend.'
     ''Ou '''pa sa''' jan mwen.''     'You '''cannot be''' my friend.'
     ''Non mwen '''sé''' Tjals.''     'My name '''is''' Charles.'
     ''Tjals '''sété''' an Endyen.''  'Charles '''was''' an Indian.'
Escure &amp; Schwegler claim that ''sé'' is a copula verb. DeGraff &lt;ref&gt;DeGraff, M. (2007). Kreyòl Ayisyen, or Haitian Creole (Creole French). Comparative Creole Syntax. London: Battlebridge, 101-126.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that ''sé'' in Haitian Creole is a resumptive pronominal that spells out the trace produced by subject-[[Raising (linguistics)|raising]] to [[Specifier (linguistics)|Spec]] ([[Complementizer|CP]]) from within a small clause headed by the nominal predicate. The subject is first merged within the (extended) projection of the nominal predicate – i .e., in the subject position of the small clause – but it must move to Spec (CP) in order to check its Case and satisfy the [[Extended Projection Principle]].

=== Korean ===

====DP = DP====
The copula -i- in [[Korean language|Korean]] is ubiquitously found in presumed ‘Sluicing’ and ‘Fragment’ constructions. The copula denotes the equative relation between the subject and the complement of the copula. In (8), through the assumed equative relation, the complement of the copula describes the ‘categorial membership’ of the subject. 
 (8) a. ''Chelswu-nun chakhan        haksayng-i-ta.''
        Chelswu-Top kind-hearted   student-Cop-Decl
        ‘Chelswu is a kind-hearted student’
     b. ''hak-un      twulwumi-i-ta.''
        crane-Top   crane-Cop-Decl
         ‘A crane is a crane.’
On top of it, again through the equative relation, in (9) the complement of the copula describes the ‘characteristic property’ of the subject.
 (9) a. ''pangan-i  engmang-i-ta.''
         room-Nom  mess-Cop-Decl
         ‘A room is a mess.’
       b. ''toli-nun   cengkwusomssi-ka  seykyeycek4-i-ta.'' 
          Toli-Top   tennis skill-Nom  world-class-Cop-Decl 
         ‘Toli is world class in tennis skill.’

====DP = CP====
When the copula is not present, no equative relation holds, prohibiting the pronominal subject of the small clause. In the former case, the [[Indefinite article|indefinite expression]] as a correlate expression is equative with the surviving expression. In the latter case, the usual referring expression as a correlate expression cannot be equative with the surviving expression that it is in contrast with.&lt;ref&gt;Park, M. K. The syntax of ‘sluicing’/‘fragmenting’in Korean: Evidence from the copula-i-‘be’.&lt;/ref&gt; Equative (Identificational) Copular Construction (ECC) as shown in (10), both nominal expressions in the Equative Copular Construction are referential expressions and hence denote individual entities denoted by the two nominal expressions. The construction expresses the identity relation between the entities denoted by the two nominal expressions. 
 (10) ''Chelswu-ka [ne-ka     ecey         ttayli-n  salam]-i-ta.''
      C-Nom       you-Nom   yesterday    hit-Adn   person-Cop-Decl
      ‘Chelswu is the one that you hit yesterday.’

Since the Equative Copular Construction is involved with the two referential nouns, no word order restriction is expected with regard to the focus information.&lt;ref&gt;Jo, J. M. (2007). Word Order Variations in Korean Copular Constructions. 언어학, 15(3), 209-238.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-copular equative constructions ==

=== Russian ===

==== DP = DP ====
[[Russian language|Russian]] equative sentences have a distinct syntactical structure which distinguishes them from predicational sentences. They require a constant form of the demonstrative pronoun ''eto'' 'this' (Sg. Neutral) to indicate that the two XPs have the same referent. 
 (11) ''Mark Twain       -     *(éto) Samuel Clemens.''
      Mark Twain. Nom  this  Samuel Clemens.Nom
      Mark Twain is Samuel Clemens
This is because Russian has a zero present form copula (the present tense form of ''byt’'', ''est’'', is never used in this context). The demonstrative pronoun, however, is excluded from predicational sentences. In addition, although Russian has case endings on the ends of nouns, both XPs occur in the Nominative case in an equative sentence but not in a predicational one. The [[demonstrative]] pronoun likewise never gets inflected in equative sentences. In order to warrant that XP2 in the Instrumental is excluded from éto-sentence (and not because of lacking an overt copula), we have an overt form of the ''byt''' copula. 
 (12) ''Ciceron     - éto   byl      Tullij.''
      Cicero.Nom    this  was.Masc Tully.Nom
      'Cicero was Tully'
 (13) *''Ciceron     - éto       byl      Tulliem.''
      Cicero.Nom    this.Neut was.Masc Tully.Ins
      'Cicero was Tully'
There is strong evidence that in (12), XP2 is the underlying subject: the copula agrees with XP2 and not with ''ėto'', which remains Singular Neuter. Nominative. Whereas XP1 functions as an external topic, the demonstrative pronoun éto is a base-generated internal topic. &lt;ref&gt;Geist, L. (2007). Predication and equation in copular sentences: Russian vs. english. (pp. 79-105). Dordrecht: Springer Netherlands. doi:10.1007/978-1-4020-6197-4_3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polish ===

====DP = DP====
[[Polish language|Polish]] equatives differ in syntactic structure considerably from predicational and specificational copula classes, with respect to agreement pattern. Polish true equatives contain two nominative DPs (proper names or pronouns), which surround the copula. There are two types of copula: the pronominal copula ''to'', and the verbal copula ''być'' 'to be'. Unlike Polish to-predicational clauses in which they are restricted to 3rd person pronouns only, the equatives with pronominal copula ''to'' allows the pre-copular element to be in 1st or 2nd person perspective.
{|
|-

 (14) a. ''Ja    to   ty.''
         I.NOM COP  you.NOM.
        ‘I am you.’
 (15) a. ''Wy         to  my.'' 
         You.PL.NOM COP we.NOM.
         'You are we.'
|}
Moreover, in Polish equative sentences, the verb always agrees with the pre-copular element. The two copulas can also co-occur with each other.  If it is in the present tense, it can always be omitted. If it is omitted in the past or future tense, the time interpretation will be misunderstood as referring to the present only.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Bondaruk, Gréte Dalmi and Alexander Gros (2013) "Polish equatives as symmetrical structures" Copular clauses in English and Polish: Structure, derivation, and interpretation. 61-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish equatives sometimes involve both the operation of [[wh-movement]] and deletion. All instances of unbounded deletion obeying island constraints are instances of wh-movement and deletion. The deletion might apply in conjunction with wh-movement or it might apply alone. When it applies alone, it is both unbounded and subject to island constraints. For instance, in (17), ''Jak'' appears in wh-questions, which suggests that the equative shown in (18) involves wh-movement. In (19), deletion applies in conjunction with wh-movement.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Borsley. (Sep., 1981). Wh-Movement" and Unbounded Deletion in Polish Equatives.

=== Arabic ===
This description concerns [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA). Like Russian and Polish, MSA uses no copular verb in present tense equative sentences but requires one in the past and future. The subject and predicate in MSA equative sentences must agree in case ([[nominative]]), number, and gender &lt;ref&gt;Abdel-Ghafer, O. (2003). Copular constructions in modern standard Arabic, modern Hebrew and English. ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject must always be definite for a sentential reading, while the predicate is definite or indefinite depending on whether an article is also used in the sentence.

The following equation does not involve an article, so the predicate 'the student' is in [[indefinite form]].

 (20) samir-un        taalib-un
      samir-nom       student-nom
     "Samir   (is)    a student"

In the following construction, an article interferes between the subject and predicate, so the predicate is in [[Definiteness|definite form]]. 3MS means 3rd person masculine singular.

 (21) samir-un    huwa    t-taalib-u
      samir-nom   3MS     the student-nom
     "Samir   (is)        the student"

=== Okanagan Salish ===
This description concerns the [[Interior Salish]] language of the [[Colville-Okanagan]] region, named [[Syilx|Nsyilxcən]]. Its classification here as non-copular is due to its lack of an overt copula. Rather, Nsyilxcən equatives are said to be projections of a null head. 
Nsyilxcən DP-DP structures involve a null, equative copula. 
The interpretation of DP-DP structures in Nsyilxcən overlaps with that of both predicational and equative clauses in English.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, F. R. (1973). The Pseudo-cleft Construction In English. Ph. D. thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA&lt;/ref&gt; The semantics of the equative head fit with intensionality-based accounts of English equatives.&lt;ref&gt;Comorovski, I. (2007). Constituent questions and the copula of specification. In I. Comorovski and K. von Heusinger (Eds.), Existence. Semantics and Syntax, pp. 49–77. Dordrecht: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between predicational and equative sentences is motivated by a word order restriction that is for DP-DP structures in answer to WH-questions, which is not apparent for a corresponding direct predication. As well, Nsyilxcən does not have specificational sentences in the classic sense, but it does have DP-DP equatives with a fixed information structure resembling inverse specificational copular clauses in English.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, J. (2013). Predication and Equation in Okanagan Salish: The Syntax and Semantics of Determiner Phrases. Ph. D. thesis, The University Of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC&lt;/ref&gt;

==== DP = DP ====
[[File:Nsyilxcen picture1.jpg|thumb|Equational sentences showing DET iʔ DP structure.]]
In Nsyilxcən, equatives exhibit a DP=DP structure. As in English, two adjacent DPs standing in an equivalence relationship are interpreted as semantically equative, given that neither DP can be a predicate. This equative has an encoded word order restriction which is absent from predications involving other syntactic categories, such that in answer to a WH-question, a directly referential demonstrative or proper name must precede a DP headed by the determiner "iʔ" (an “iʔ DP”). The implication is that specificational sentences are not possible in Nsyilxcən. 
&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, J. (2013). Predication and Equation in Okanagan Salish: The Syntax and Semantics of Determiner Phrases. Ph. D. thesis, The University Of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC&lt;/ref&gt;

===== DP = DP Clefts =====
Nsyilxcən clefts are structurally equivalent to DP=DP structures, implying that clefts are also equatives in this language.
#  
 (22) ixíʔ iʔ səx&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;-m’aʔ-m’áyaʔ-m iʔ k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;u      q&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;əl-q&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;íl-st-s.
      DEM DET OCC-RED-teach-MID DET 1SG.ABS RED-speak-(CAUS)-3SG.ERG 
     a. That’s the teacher that talked to me.
     b. That teacher is the one that talked to me.
     c. It’s the teacher who talked to me.

The null equative head in Nsyilxcən lexically assigns the syntactic feature ‘F’ to its second (leftmost) argument, which is interpretable as ‘focus’ at the interfaces

#
 (23) [ixíʔ &lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = [iʔ pəptwínax&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt;]. 
      DEM = DET old.lady
      SHE is the old lady.
# 
 (24) *[iʔ pəptwínax&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt;] = [ixíʔ&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;.
      DET old.lady = DEM 
      The old lady is HER.

==== DP(DP(CP)) ====
[[File:Okanagan example 2, Relative clause.png|thumb|Relative clause equative structure]]
Nsyilxcən equatives can also involve [[relative clause]] modification.
The bracketed, relative clause "iʔ wíkən" ‘that I saw’ restricts the bird under discussion in (36a), and the nominalized relative clause "[iʔ] isck’ʷúl" ‘the (one) that I made’ restricts the type of shirt under discussion in (36b).  
[[File:Head initial relative clauses illustrating position of DET iʔ.png|thumb|left|Head initial relative clauses illustrating position of DET iʔ]]
For Nsyilxcən, a relative clause is not identifiable by special inflectional morphology on the clausal modifier, but instead by an "iʔ" determiner and/or "t" marker which precede the modifying head. Relative clause modification can be either head final or head initial.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, J. (2013). Predication and Equation in Okanagan Salish: The Syntax and Semantics of Determiner Phrases. Ph. D. thesis, The University Of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC&lt;/ref&gt;
Salish relative clauses can be analyzed based not only on relative head-modifier ordering, but also on whether or not a particle introduces both the head and modifier.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, H. (2005). Constituency and Coordination in St’át’imcets (Lillooet Salish). In A. Carnie, S. A. Dooley, and H. Harley (Eds.), Verb First: on the Syntax of Verb Initial Languages.

=== Chinese ===

==== DP = DP ====
Although Chinese was discussed earlier as having copular equative constructions, it also holds non-copular equative constructions. 
 (24) a. 他不好看。 ''tā bù hǎokàn.''
         He-NOM NEG good-looking.
         'He is not good-looking.'
The copular verb 是 ''shì'' is often interpreted as having been left out optionally, but this is actually no the case, as the following sentence is ungrammatical:
 (25) b. *他是不好看。 ''tā shì bù hǎokàn.''
         He-NOM COP NEG good-looking.
         *'He is not good-looking.'
For (25b) to be grammatical, the complementizer 的 ''de'' is necessary at the end of the adjectival phrase [''bù hǎokàn''].

''Fides et ratio'' was the first encyclical since [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s 1879 ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' to address the relationship between faith and reason.&lt;ref name=Fagan&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/education/catholic-contributions/fides-et-ratio-faith-and-reason.html Fagan, John. ''The Teachings of Pope John Paul II: Summaries of Papal Documents'', (New York: Scepter Publishers, 2005): 64-71]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The encyclical posits that faith and reason are not only compatible, but essential together. Faith without reason, he argues, leads to [[superstition]]. Reason without faith, he argues, leads to [[nihilism]] and [[relativism]]. He writes:

{{quote|4 Through philosophy's work, the ability to speculate which is proper to the human intellect produces a rigorous mode of thought; and then in turn, through the logical coherence of the affirmations made and the organic unity of their content, it produces a systematic body of knowledge.... [T]his has brought with it the temptation to identify one single stream with the whole of philosophy. In such cases, we are clearly dealing with a "philosophical pride" which seeks to present its own partial and imperfect view as the complete reading of all reality....}}

Although reason creates a "systematic body of knowledge," the Pope avers, its completeness is illusory: 

{{quote|5 Yet the positive results achieved must not obscure the fact that reason, in its one-sided concern to investigate human subjectivity, seems to have forgotten that men and women are always called to direct their steps towards a truth which transcends them. Sundered from that truth, individuals are at the mercy of caprice, and their state as person ends up being judged by pragmatic criteria based essentially upon experimental data, in the mistaken belief that technology must dominate all. It has happened therefore that reason, rather than voicing the human orientation towards truth, has wilted under the weight of so much knowledge and little by little has lost the capacity to lift its gaze to the heights, not daring to rise to the truth of being. Abandoning the investigation of being, modern philosophical research has concentrated instead upon human knowing. Rather than make use of the human capacity to know the truth, modern philosophy has preferred to accentuate the ways in which this capacity is limited and conditioned.}}

Without a grounding in spiritual truth, he continues, reason has: 

{{quote|5 ...given rise to different forms of agnosticism and relativism which have led philosophical research to lose its way in the shifting sands of widespread scepticism. Recent times have seen the rise to prominence of various doctrines which tend to devalue even the truths which had been judged certain. A legitimate plurality of positions has yielded to an undifferentiated pluralism, based upon the assumption that all positions are equally valid, which is one of today's most widespread symptoms of the lack of confidence in truth. Even certain conceptions of life coming from the East betray this lack of confidence, denying truth its exclusive character and assuming that truth reveals itself equally in different doctrines, even if they contradict one another. On this understanding, everything is reduced to opinion; and there is a sense of being adrift. While, on the one hand, philosophical thinking has succeeded in coming closer to the reality of human life and its forms of expression, it has also tended to pursue issues—existential, hermeneutical or linguistic—which ignore the radical question of the truth about personal existence, about being and about God. Hence we see among the men and women of our time, and not just in some philosophers, attitudes of widespread distrust of the human being's great capacity for knowledge. With a false modesty, people rest content with partial and provisional truths, no longer seeking to ask radical questions about the meaning and ultimate foundation of human, personal and social existence. In short, the hope that philosophy might be able to provide definitive answers to these questions has dwindled.}}

On the roles of philosophy and speculative theology as manifested by [[Augustine]]:

{{quote|40. The Bishop of Hippo succeeded in producing the first great synthesis of philosophy and theology, embracing currents of thought both Greek and Latin. In him too the great unity of knowledge, grounded in the thought of the Bible, was both confirmed and sustained by a depth of speculative thinking. The synthesis devised by Saint Augustine remained for centuries the most exalted form of philosophical and theological speculation known to the West. Reinforced by his personal story and sustained by a wonderful holiness of life, he could also introduce into his works a range of material which, drawing on experience, was a prelude to future developments in different currents of philosophy.}}

On the wrong turns in modern philosophy and the duty of the magisterium:

{{quote|49. The Church has no philosophy of her own nor does she canonize any one particular philosophy in preference to others... Yet history shows that philosophy—especially modern philosophy—has taken wrong turns and fallen into error. It is neither the task nor the competence of the Magisterium to intervene in order to make good the lacunas of deficient philosophical discourse. Rather, it is the Magisterium's duty to respond clearly and strongly when controversial philosophical opinions threaten right understanding of what has been revealed, and when false and partial theories which sow the seed of serious error, confusing the pure and simple faith of the People of God, begin to spread more widely.}}

{{quote|50. In the light of faith, therefore, the Church's Magisterium can and must authoritatively exercise a critical discernment of opinions and philosophies which contradict Christian doctrine. It is the task of the Magisterium in the first place to indicate which philosophical presuppositions and conclusions are incompatible with revealed truth, thus articulating the demands which faith's point of view makes of philosophy.}}

In sum, the Pope "makes this strong and insistent appeal" that "faith and philosophy recover the profound unity which allows them to stand in harmony with their nature without compromising their mutual autonomy. The [[parrhesia]] of faith must be matched by the boldness of reason.

'''Françoise Meltzer''' (born 1947) is a professor of Philosophy of Religion at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_28-10-2004_pg4_7|title=‘French’ becomes a dirty word in US campaign|last=Maler|first=Sandra|date=October 28, 2004|work=Daily Times|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also the Edward Carson Waller Distinguished Service Professor of the Humanities and Chair of [[Comparative Literature]] at the [[University of Chicago]].

==Work==
Meltzer's scholarship includes work on contemporary critical theory and nineteenth-century [[French literature]]. She marshals [[postmodern]] critical theories in order to explore literary representations of the subject. 

In her book ''Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality'', she examines the ideas of originality and authorship in a series of case studies from [[Descartes]] to [[Walter Benjamin]]. In her book on [[Joan of Arc]], she undertakes a study of that figure in relation to subjectivity as it is treated in philosophical and literary theoretical courses. 

Meltzer co-edited a ''Symposium on [God]'' for the journal ''[[Critical Inquiry]]''. With [[Jas Elsner|Jas' Elsner]], Meltzer co-edited a special issue of ''Critical Inquiry'' on theories of saints and sainthood in three monotheistic religions. She is co-editing a book on religion and postmodernist texts, and also working on two monographs; one about 1848 in France, and the concept of rupture from a philosophical, political, and literary point of view; the other about the gendering of subjectivity.

In Scotland, the first Monday after New Year's Day was traditionally known as '''Hansel Monday''', or '''Handsel Monday''', and gifts ({{lang-sco|Hansels}}) were given at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-han2.htm Michael Quinion, "World Wide Words: Handsel"]. Retrieved 7 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the rural population of Scotland, ''[[wikt:auld|Auld]] Hansel Monday'', is traditionally celebrated on the first Monday after January 12. This custom reflects a reluctance to switch from the old ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]) style calendar to the new ([[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]) calendar.&lt;ref name="World Dict"&gt;[http://www.credoreference.com/entry/hfcwd/handsel_monday. ''Holidays, Festivals, and Celebrations of the World Dictionary'', ''s.v.'' "Handsel Monday," Detroit: Omnigraphics, Inc., 2010]. Retrieved 7 January 2013,&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word "handsel" originates from old Saxon word which means “to deliver into the hand”. It refers to small tips and gifts of money given as a token&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotslanguage.com/articles/words/1154 Handsel at Scots Language Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130705033754/http://www.scotslanguage.com/articles/words/1154 |date=2013-07-05 }}. Retrieved 4 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; of good luck, particularly at the beginning of something; the modern house-warming gift would be a good example. An 1825 glossary marks Handsel Monday as an occasion "when it is customary to make children and servants a present".&lt;ref&gt;John Trotter Brockett, A glossary of north country words, in use, 1st edition, 1 vol., Newcastle upon Tyne: 1825.&lt;/ref&gt; On this day, tips of small gifts were expected by servants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/handsel%20monday Definition at Merriam-Webster]. Retrieved 4 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the postman, the deliverers of newspapers, scavengers, and all persons who wait upon the house.

In this respect it is somewhat similar to [[Boxing Day]], which eventually supplanted it.&lt;ref name="World Dict" /&gt; If the handsel was a physical object rather than money, tradition said that the object could not be sharp, or it would "cut" the relationship between the giver and the recipient. The day is known in [[Scottish Gaelic]] as {{lang|gd|Diluain Traoighte}} (drained Monday).

The custom was also known as “handseling a purse”. A new purse would not be given to anyone without placing money in it for good luck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/T100054.html The History of Ireland]. Retrieved 4 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Money received during Handsel Monday is supposed to insure monetary luck all for the rest of the year.

{{quote|It is worth mentioning that one William Hunter, a collier (residing in the parish of [[Tillicoultry]], in [[Clackmannanshire]]), was cured in the year 1738 of an inveterate rheumatism or gout, by drinking freely of new ale, full of harm or yeast. The poor man had been confined to his bed. for a year and a half, having almost entirely lost the use of his limbs. On the evening of '''Handsel Monday''', as it is called, some of his neighbours came to make merry with him. Though he could not rise, yet he always took his share of the ale, as it passed round the company, and in the end he became much intoxicated. The consequence was that he had the use of his limbs next morning, and was able to walk about. He lived more than twenty years after this, and never had the smallest return of his old complaint.|[[Sir John Sinclair|Sinclair]]|''[[Statistical Account of Scotland]]'', 1792, xv., note on p. 201.}}

'''Impunity''' means "exemption from punishment or loss or escape from fines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/impunity |title=Free Dictionary |publisher=Free Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[international law]] of [[human rights]], it refers to the failure to bring perpetrators of [[human rights violations]] to justice and, as such, itself constitutes a denial of the victims' right to [[justice]] and [[Legal remedy|redress]]. Impunity is especially common in countries that lack a tradition of the [[rule of law]], suffer from [[Political corruption|corruption]] or that have entrenched systems of [[patronage]], or where the [[judiciary]] is weak or members of the security forces are protected by special [[jurisdiction]]s or [[immunity from prosecution|immunities]].

The amended ''Set of Principles for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights Through Action to Combat Impunity'', submitted to the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission on Human Rights]] on 8 February 2005, defines impunity as:
:"the impossibility, ''[[de jure]]'' or ''[[de facto]]'', of bringing the perpetrators of violations to account – whether in criminal, civil, administrative or disciplinary proceedings – since they are not subject to any inquiry that might lead to their being accused, arrested, tried and, if found guilty, sentenced to appropriate penalties, and to making reparations to their victims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derechos.org/nizkor/impu/principles.html |title=Principles for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights Through Action to Combat Impunity |publisher=Derechos.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Principle of that same document states that:
:"Impunity arises from a failure by States to meet their obligations to investigate violations; to take appropriate measures in respect of the perpetrators, particularly in the area of justice, by ensuring that those suspected of criminal responsibility are prosecuted, tried and duly punished; to provide victims with effective remedies and to ensure that they receive reparation for the injuries suffered; to ensure the inalienable right to know the truth about violations; and to take other necessary steps to prevent a recurrence of violations."

[[Truth and reconciliation commission]]s are frequently established by nations emerging from periods marked by human rights violations – [[coup d'état|coups d'état]], [[military dictatorship]]s, [[civil war]]s, etc. – in order to cast light on the events of the past. While such mechanisms can assist in the ultimate prosecution of crimes and punishment of the guilty, they have often been criticised for perpetuating impunity by enabling violators to seek protection of concurrently adopted [[amnesty law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/what-next-international-justice "What Next for International Justice?"]''International Center for Transitional Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary goal of the Rome Statute of the [[International Criminal Court]], adopted on 17 July 1998 and entered into force on 1 July 2002, is "to put an end to impunity for the perpetrators" [...] "of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole".&lt;ref&gt;[Preamble, Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Center for the Economics of Human Development ===
Founded in 2014 and directed by Heckman, the [https://cehd.uchicago.edu/ Center for the Economics of Human Development] (CEHD), at the University of Chicago, umbrellas his multiple research areas and initiatives that encompass rigorous empirical research to determine effective human capital policies and program design. CEHD initiatives include the [https://hceconomics.uchicago.edu/ Human Capital and Economic Opportunity Global Working Group], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160325203602/http://cehd.uchicago.edu/page/pritzker-consortium-early-childhood-development Pritzker Consortium on Early Childhood Development], the [http://heckmanequation.org/ Heckman Equation], the [https://cehd.uchicago.edu/lifecourse Research Network on the Determinants of Life Course Capabilities and Outcomes], and the [https://cehd.uchicago.edu/page/asian-family-transition-initiative Asian Family in Transition Initiative].

==Research==
Heckman is noted for his contributions to [[selection bias]] and [[self-selection]] analysis, especially [[Heckman correction]], which awarded him the Nobel Prize in Economics. He is also well known for his empirical research in [[labor economics]], particularly regarding the efficacy of [[early childhood education]] programs.

His work has been devoted to the development of a scientific basis for economic policy evaluation, with special emphasis on models of individuals and disaggregated groups, and the problems and possibilities created by [[unobserved heterogeneity|heterogeneity, diversity, and unobserved counterfactual states]]. He developed a body of new econometric tools that address these issues. His research has given policymakers important new insights into areas such as education, jobtraining, the importance of accounting for general equilibrium in the analysis of labor markets, anti-discrimination law, and civil rights. He demonstrated a strong causal effect of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] in promoting [[African-American]] economic progress. He has recently demonstrated that the high school dropout rate is increasing in the US. He has studied the economic benefits of sorting in the labor market, the ineffectiveness of active labor market programs, and the economic returns to education. 

His recent research focuses on inequality, human development and lifecycle skill formation, with a special emphasis on the economics of early childhood education. He is currently conducting new social experiments on early childhood interventions and reanalyzing old experiments. He is also studying the emergence of the underclass in the US and [[Western Europe]]. For example, he showed that a high IQ only improved an individual's chances of financial success by 1 or 2%.&lt;ref name="bloombergifyouresosmart"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flam|first1=Faye|title=If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-22/if-you-re-so-smart-why-aren-t-you-rich|accessdate=June 2, 2017|work=Bloomberg|date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, "conscientiousness," or "diligence, perseverance and self-discipline," are what lead to financial success.&lt;ref name="bloombergifyouresosmart"/&gt;

In the early 1990s, his pioneering research, on the outcomes of people who obtain the [[GED]] certificate, received national attention.

Heckman has published over 300 articles and several books. His books include ''Inequality in America: What Role for Human Capital Policy?'' (with Alan Krueger); ''Evaluating Human Capital Policy, Law, and Employment: Lessons from Latin America and the Caribbean'' (with Carmen Pages); the ''Handbook of Econometrics'', volumes 5, 6A, and 6B (edited with Edward Leamer); ''Global Perspectives on the Rule of Law,'' (edited with R. Nelson and L. Cabatingan); and ''The Myth of Achievement Tests: The GED and the Role of Character in American Life'' (with John Eric Humphries and Tim Kautz).

He is currently co-editor of the ''Journal of Political Economy''. He is also a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (USA) and the [[American Philosophical Society]]. He is  a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Econometric Society]] (of which he is also former president), the [[Society of Labor Economics]], the [[American Statistical Association]], and the [[International Statistical Institute]].

==Awards==
Heckman has received numerous awards for his work, including the [[John Bates Clark Medal]] of the American Economic Association in 1983, the 2005 and 2007 Dennis Aigner Award for Applied Econometrics from the ''Journal of Econometrics'', the 2005 Jacob Mincer Award for Lifetime Achievement in Labor Economics, the 2005 Ulysses Medal from the University College Dublin, the 2007 Theodore W. Schultz Award from the American Agricultural Economics Association, the Gold Medal of the President of the Italian Republic awarded by the International Scientific Committee of the Pio Manzú Centre in 2008, the Distinguished Contributions to Public Policy for Children Award from the Society for Research in Child Development in 2009, the 2014 Frisch Medal from the Econometric Society, the 2014 Spirit of Erikson Award from the Erikson Institute, and the 2016 Dan David Prize for Combating Poverty from Tel Aviv University.

==Personal life==
Heckman is married to sociologist Lynne Pettler-Heckman with whom he has two children: a son, Jonathan (b. 1982) who is a physicist at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and a daughter, Alma (b. 1986), who is an assistant professor of history at the [[University of California at Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref name=nndb /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alma Heckman's website at UC Santa Cruz |url=http://history.ucsc.edu/faculty/profiles/singleton.php?&amp;singleton=true&amp;cruz_id=aheckman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Philibert Damiron''' ({{IPA-fr|damiʁɔ̃|lang}}; 10 January 1794 – 11 January 1862) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]].

==Biography==
Damiron was born at [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]]. At nineteen he entered the normal school, where he studied under [[Eugène Burnouf]], [[Abel-Francois Villemain]], and [[Victor Cousin]]. After teaching for several years in provincial towns, he came to [[Paris, France|Paris]], where he lectured on philosophy in various institutions, and finally became professor in the normal school, and titular professor at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In 1824 he joined [[Paul-François Dubois]] and [[Théodore Simon Jouffroy]] in establishing ''[[Le Globe]]''; and he was also a member of the committee of the society which took for its motto ''[[Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera]]''. In 1833 he was appointed chevalier of the Legion of Honour, and in 1836 member of the Academy of Moral Sciences. Damiron died in Paris.

His chief works, of which the best are his accounts of French philosophers, are the following: An edition of the ''Nouveaux mélanges philosophiques de Jouffroy'' (1842), with a notice of the author, in which Damiron softened and omitted several expressions used by Jouffroy, which were opposed to the system of education adopted by the Sorbonne, an article which gave rise to a bitter controversy, and to a book by [[Pierre Leroux]], ''De la mutilation des manuscrits de M. Jouffroy'' (1843); ''Essai sur l'histoire de la philosophie en France au XIX&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle'' (I828, 3rd ed. 1834); ''Essai sur l'histoire de la philosophie en France au XVII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle'' (1846); ''Mémoires a servir pour l'histoire de la philosophie en France au XVIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle'' (1858-1864); ''Cours de la philosophie''; ''De la Providence'' (1849, 1850).

See [[Adolphe Franck]], ''Moralistes et philosophes'' (1872).

'''''Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?''''' is a 2009 book on [[political philosophy]] by [[Michael J. Sandel]].

== Background ==
The work was written to accompany Sandel's famous "Justice" course at [[Harvard University]] which he has taught for more than thirty years and which has been offered online and in various TV summary versions. There is also an accompanying sourcebook of readings: ''Justice: A Reader''.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;

== Summary ==
Sandel addresses a series of alternative theories of justice. The [[utilitarianism]] of [[Jeremy Bentham]] is outlined and criticised and then [[John Stuart Mill]]'s refinements are discussed. The [[libertarians]], in particular [[Robert Nozick]], and their arguments are discussed. Then Sandel discusses [[Immanuel Kant]] and his '[[categorical imperative]]'. The discussion then goes on to [[John Rawls]]'s work.  Then [[Aristotle]] and the concept of '[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]' is discussed. It is here that Sandel begins to make clear his own perspective. He argues that justice, rather than being autonomous (as Kantians or Rawlsians might have it), has a goal. A form of [[communitarianism]]. Sandel quotes [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and his characterisation of humans as being 'storytelling beings' who live their lives with ''narrative quests''.

== Reception ==
Despite the controversial and polarizing nature of the material, the reviews have largely been positive. ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Sandel's ability to teach and says, "If 'Justice' breaks no new philosophical ground, it succeeds at something perhaps no less important: in terms we can all understand, it confronts us with the concepts that lurk, so often unacknowledged, beneath our conflicts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/books/review/Rauch-t.html|title=Book Review {{!}} 'Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do?,' by Michael J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1303">'''Lexicalist hypothesis''' is a hypothesis, proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]], in which he claims that syntactic transformations only can operate on syntactic constituents&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;. Lexicalist hypothesis is a response to [[Generative semantics|generative semanticians]] who use transformations in the derivation of complex words.

There are two versions of lexicalist hypothesis: the weak version and the strong version. In weak version the transformations could not operate on the derivational words; and in strong version, the transformations could not operate on both derivational and inflectional words.

There are objections to the hypothesis such as [[distributed morphology]]&lt;ref&gt;Halle &amp; Marantz (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:A copy of the Magna glossatura.jpg|thumb]]
{{italic title}}
The '''''Collectanea''''', or '''''Magna glossatura''''' as it came to be known, is a collection of commentaries on the [[Psalms]] and the [[Pauline Epistles]] written by [[Peter the Lombard]] between 1139 and 1141.

==Origin and characteristics==

The ''Magna glossatura'' is a set of [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]es written beside passages from the [[Latin Vulgate Bible]]. These glosses were written by Peter the Lombard during his teaching career and before he became the bishop of Paris (1159–1160). His gloss of Psalms and his gloss of the Pauline Epistles (referred to as the ''Collectanea'') were compiled and became a part of the official gloss on the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection of glosses would take on the name of ''Magna glossatura'' and would, during the 12th century, replace the ''Glossa ordinaria'' as the most frequently studied and copied exegetical gloss of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colish|first1=Marcia L.|title=Peter Lombard|date=1994|publisher=Brill's Studies in Intellectual History|location=New York|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other works included the ''Libri Quatuor Sententiarum'' (or the ''[[Sentences|Four Books of Sentences]]'') and his commentaries in the ''glossa Ordinaria''. The ''Magna glossatura'', along with other systematic glosses, would have been developed at theological schools such as Laon and St.-Victor of Paris, and would have been used for the research conducted by theologians as well as the teaching of students in biblical exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bouchard|first1=Constance B.|title=The Cistercians and the "glossa Ordinaria"|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|date=2000|volume=86 |issue=2|pages=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The layout of text in the ''Magna glossatura'', is written in the ''intercisum'' (or intercut) format, which was developed by Peter Lombard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Lesley|title=The Glossa Ordinaria : The Making of a Medieval Bible Commentary|date=2009|publisher=Brill|location=Boston|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed as a way of distinguishing scripture from the commentaries by writing the biblical verses in a larger script and on alternate lines next to the commentary, which would be ordered into columns. Blocks of scripture were then placed on the left edge of the columns to balance the biblical verses with the commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''intercisum'' method, from ca.1160, began to be applied to glosses on all the books of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; This layout also gave glosses and their commentators greater influence in their relationship with the Word of God, as these glosses played a larger role in theological books by forming an essential reading in connection with the biblical text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Lombard's gloss of the Pauline Epistles features not only commentaries concerning the traditional mode of reflection on the Christian faith, which regards the biblical text as ''sacra pagina'', but also commentaries of systematic theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Lombard writes on specific theological themes which deal with issues such as the nature of the Trinity. Lombard's glosses also include references to the works of other ecclesiastical figures and theologians, [[Ambrose]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] to name a few. The biblical commentaries and ideas present in the ''Magna glossatura'' are also present in the various sermons given by Peter Lombard to his peers and to his cathedral's congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosemann|first1=Philipp W.|title=Peter Lombard|date=2004|publisher=Oxford  University Press|location=New York|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matching funds''' are funds that are set to be paid in equal amount to funds available from other sources.  Matching fund payments usually arise in situations of charity or [[Public interest|public good]]. The terms [[cost sharing]], in-kind, and matching are often used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://policy.umn.edu/Policies/Research/COSTSHARING_PROC02.html |title=University of Minnesota Policy |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable causes==
In philanthropic giving, foundations and corporations often give money to non-profit entities in the form of a '''matching gift'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantspace.org/Tools/Knowledge-Base/Funding-Resources/Corporations/Matching-gifts|title=Where can I learn more about workplace giving, like employee matching gifts?|first=|last=Grantspace|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate matches often take the form of employee matching gifts, which means that if an employee donates to a nonprofit, the employee's corporation will donate money to the same nonprofit according to a predetermined match ratio (usually 1:1). For foundations, matching gifts are in the form of grants made directly to nonprofits if that the nonprofit raises a set quantity of money before the grant is bestowed. The benefit of foundation matching grants is that they provide greater incentive leverage when a nonprofit is fundraising from its constituency. If a foundation approves a 1:1 matching grant, donors know that their dollars will be doubled. On the other side, foundations who give matching grants receive assurance of the nonprofit's capacity to raise adequate funds.

For example, Dr. [[Booker T. Washington]], a famous [[African-American]] [[educator]], had a long-time friendship with [[millionaire]] [[industrialist]] [[Henry H. Rogers]], who provided him with substantial amounts of money to be applied for the betterment and education of black Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Washington later wrote that Rogers had encouraged projects with at least partial matching funds'' so that two ends were accomplished: 
# The gifts would help fund even greater work. 
# Recipients would have a stake in knowing that they were helping themselves by their own hard work and sacrifice.

Using the matching funds philosophy, after Rogers's death, [[Julius Rosenwald]] and the [[Rosenwald Fund]] continued and expanded the work, eventually funding over 5,000 [[Rosenwald School]]s between 1912 and 1932. During that time, over US$4.6 million additional dollars were contributed by [[Black people|blacks]] in the communities to respond to the challenge thus presented.

In 1954, the General Electrics Foundation created the Corporate Alumni Program to match donations to the colleges and universities that employees graduated from.  This eventually broadened to other charities.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qgiv.com/blog/nonprofit-matching-gifts/|title=10 Awesome Matching Gift Resources for Nonprofits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The foundation is one of the most generous with a $25,000 match per employee or retiree. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gefoundation.com/giving-programs/matching-gifts/|title=Matching Gifts - GE Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies facilitate the process, allowing employers to match the gifts of their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qgiv.com/blog/nonprofit-matching-gifts/|title=10 Awesome Matching Gift Resources for Nonprofits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A matching gift, typically a one-time charitable gift made by an employee and matched by the employer, should not be confused with an [[employer matching program]], which has to do with the employee's [[401(k)]] plan and [[retirement]].

In 2014, corporations donated $17.8 Billion to nonprofit organizations. This is a 13.7% increase over 2013 corporate giving levels. In 2010, matching gifts represented ~20% of corporate cash donations.  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.qgiv.com/blog/nonprofit-matching-gifts/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, over 65% of Fortune 500 companies offer an employee matching gift program. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qgiv.com/blog/nonprofit-matching-gifts/|title=Matching Gift &amp; Corporate Philanthropy Statistics (Updated)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the not-for-profit organisation, [[the Big Give]], have used match funding to raise over £97m for thousands of different charitable projects. The match funding is provided by a network of philanthropists and funders, called 'Champions'. Research commissioned by the Big Give shows that more people give when donations are matched (84% of surveyed respondents said they would be more likely to give if donation was matched) and people give more (one in three donors said they would give more than they usually would if do). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.thebiggive.org.uk/static/docs/A-Great+Match-EVersion.pdf|title=A Great Match|last=|first=|date=|website=www.theBigGive.org.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure funding==
In the United States, many projects in the various states and communities are partially funded with federal grants with a requirement for matching funds. For example, the [[Interstate Highway System]] was primarily built with a mix of 90% FHWA funds from the Highway Trust Fund and 10% matching state DOT funds. In some cases, borrowed money may be used to meet criteria for a matching grant; the $550 million Canadian federal government investment to connect a [[Detroit River International Crossing]] to [[Interstate 75 in Michigan]] qualifies the state for US$2 billion in US federal matching grants that can rebuild other [[Michigan]] highways even though the Canadian money is nominally a loan, to be repaid by tolls on the new bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deal reached to build new bridge to Detroit|author=Dave Battagello|publisher=Windsor Star|url=http://www.canada.com/sports/Deal+reached+build+bridge+Detroit/6791295/story.html |date=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic preservation==
US federal matching grants have also funded historic preservation initiatives; a local historic property may be able to seek a 1:1 federal matching grant for specific capital projects, such as restoration of structures on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Preservation Grants|publisher=US [[National Park Service]]|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/HPG/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
In [[American politics]], the term refers to the money a [[president of the United States|presidential]] candidate is given by [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] to match the money they have raised personally. Candidates can expect up to US$250 extra from public funds for each contribution from an individual they receive.&lt;ref name="FECMatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/pubfund.shtml |title=Public Funding of Presidential Elections |publisher=US Federal Election Commission |accessdate=January 23, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222110433/http://www.cfinst.org/pr/111005.html |archivedate=February 22, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That usually applies to the two main parties; as in order for a candidate to gain the benefits of matching funds, they must raise $5,000 from 20 states during the primaries or have received 5% of the popular vote in the general election.&lt;ref name="FECMatch"/&gt; [[Pat Buchanan]], running as the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] candidate in 2000, received matching funds despite winning only 0.4% of the vote.

The source of the funds comes from a $3 voluntary [[Presidential election campaign fund checkoff|checkoff]] on the [[US Income tax]] form. The program was established by the 1971 [[Federal Election Campaign Act]]. The law also "established overall spending limits for eligibility to receive matching funds, and provided for public funding of major party candidates in the general election for president".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Campaign Finance Regulation: Faulty Assumptions and Undemocratic Consequences|url = http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa238.html|website = www.cato.org|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect that these have on the candidates for presidential campaigns is to strengthen the role that the party plays in raising money.

Former New Mexico Governor [[Gary Johnson]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)]] candidate for president, qualified for federal matching funds in the [[2012 US presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fec.gov/press/press2012/20120531_GJohnsonEligibility.shtml |title=20120531_GJohnsonEligibility |publisher=Fec.gov |date=2012-04-27 |accessdate=2012-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601010804/http://www.fec.gov/press/press2012/20120531_GJohnsonEligibility.shtml |archivedate=2012-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on June 30, 2012, [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] presidential candidate, [[Jill Stein]], also received enough contributions to qualify.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

On July 15, 2016, ALL Party presidential candidate, Alberto Cedeno, intentionally received no contributions to avoid qualifying for federal matching funds.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Prior to a 2011 Supreme Court decision, states like Arizona, Maine, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Wisconsin were using a system that distributed "additional funding to publicly financed candidates when they face big-spending opponents or opposition groups".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Supreme Court strikes Arizona’s ‘matching funds’ for publicly financed candidates|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-strikes-arizona-system-of-matching-funds-to-publicly-financed-candidates/2011/06/26/AG92xenH_story.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2011-06-26|access-date = 2015-11-03|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Robert|last = Barnes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined cases, ''Arizona Free Enterprise Fund v. Bennett'' (2011) and ''[[McComish v. Bennett]]'' (2011) held that "the law impermissibly forces private candidates and independent political organizations to either restrain their spending or risk triggering matching funds to their publicly financed opponents".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Now, states and cities are considering the implementation of programs like [[New York City]]'s public financing model; public funds are used to multiply the impact of a small donor. The program is administered by the [[New York City Campaign Finance Board]], which has avoided partisan divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/Small%20Donor%20Matching%20Funds-The%20NYC%20Election%20Experience.pdf|title = Small Donor Matching Funds: The NYC Election Experience|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = Brennan Center for Justice|publisher = New York University School of Law|last = Migally|first = Angela|last2 = Liss|first2 = Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs work by making each contribution worth more than their current value, thereby increasing the proportional impact of the contribution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Public Financing of Judicial Races Can Give Small Donors a Decisive Role|url = https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/civil-liberties/report/2012/12/12/47657/public-financing-of-judicial-races-can-give-small-donors-a-decisive-role/|website = name|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, for example, a $6-to-$1 program has resulted in "small dollar donors constitute the vast majority of spending in New York City elections, representing 73% of all contributions in 2013 and 80% specifically to City Council race".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New York City Partial-Public Matching Program: A Model of Successful Campaign Finance Reform|url = https://www.ced.org/blog/entry/new-york-city-partial-public-matching-program-a-model-of-successful-campaig|website = Committee for Economic Development of The Conference Board|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the Brennan Center found that "by pumping up the value of small contributions, the New York City system gives [candidates] an incentive to reach out to their own constituents rather than focusing all their attention on wealthy out-of-district donors, leading them to attract more diverse donors into the political process".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/publications/DonorDiversityReport_WEB.PDF|title = Donor Diversity Through Public Matching Funds|date = May 14, 2012|accessdate = July 21, 2015|website = Brennan Center for Justice|publisher = New York University School of Law|last = Genn|first = Elisabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs of this type incentivize candidates to "fuse fundraising with voter outreach" and incentivize political engagement by communities that can afford only modest contributions. Candidates may then have more an incentive to reach out to their constituents rather than devoting their energy to financing their campaigns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ''Election Law Journal'' found that matching funds through a multiplier has increased the proportional role of small donors as well as the number of small donors. The programs have also helped to shift the demographic and class profile of those who give. Finally, besides diluting the power of major givers, these programs led candidates to reach out and engage a more representative set of constituents during fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cfinst.org/pdf/state/NYC-as-a-Model_ELJ_As-Published_March2012.pdf|title = Small Donors, Big Democracy: New York City's Matching Funds as a Model for the Nation and States|last = Malbin|first = Michael J.|date = 2012|journal = Election Law Journal|doi = 10.1089/elj.2010.0099|pmid = |access-date = July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some dispute regarding the impact of matching funds programs like the one implemented in New York City. For example, "after implementing the public matching funds program in NYC, [the] most recent mayoral election of 2009 witnessed the lowest voter turnout it's had since the 1960's".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Benefits and Inequalities of Matching Funds - CFO - Compliance|url = http://www.cfo-compliance.com/benefits-and-inequalities-of-matching-funds/|website = CFO - Compliance|accessdate = 2015-12-07|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that the matching funds system benefits candidates with higher name recognition, especially if they are tied to a measure of popular support.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some have suggested that public funding actually has a negative effect on the perceptions the public has of the government, perhaps because public funding programs do not meet "the expectations set by reformers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = What Does Research Say About Public Funding for Political Campaigns|last = Primo|first = David M.|date = August 2010|journal = Institute for Justice|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4390">'''Munich phenomenology''' (also '''Munich phenomenological school''') is the philosophical orientation of a group of [[philosophy|philosophers]] and [[psychology|psychologists]] that studied and worked in [[Munich]] at the turn of the twentieth century. Their views are grouped under the names '''[[Philosophical realism|realist]]''' (also '''realistic''') '''phenomenology''' or '''phenomenology of essences'''.  Munich Phenomenology represents one branch of what is referred to as the [[early phenomenology]].

==History==
In 1895, a number of students working with the psychologist [[Theodor Lipps]] at the [[University of Munich]] founded the ''Psychologische Verein'' ("Psychological Association"). A number of the participants in this student association, notably {{Interlanguage link multi|Johannes Daubert|de}}, [[Moritz Geiger]], [[Alexander Pfänder]], and [[Adolf Reinach]], were inspired by [[Edmund Husserl]]'s ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'' (1900/01).  The book was critical of the psychologism of their teacher (Lipps), and presented a new way of doing philosophy, known as [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Choosing to align themselves with Husserl, they became the ''Munich Circle'' of phenomenologists. Around 1905, many of Lipps' students (following the lead of Daubert) temporarily abandoned Munich and headed to the [[University of Göttingen]] to study with Husserl directly. This is referred to as the [[Göttingen phenomenology|Munich invasion of Göttingen]], and is generally considered to be the starting point of the phenomenological movement proper.  The arrival of students from Munich eventually led to the establishment of a similar student group in Göttingen circa 1910, known as the [[Göttingen Circle]].

In 1912 the ''Jahrbuch für Philosophie und phänomenologische Forschung'' was founded with Husserl, Geiger, Reinach, Pfänder, and [[Max Scheler]] as its editors. After Husserl's publication of the ''Ideen zu einer reinen Phänomenologie und phänomenologischen Philosophie. Erstes Buch'' (''Ideas I'') in the first edition of the ''Jahrbuch'', a number of his followers took a critical stance towards Husserl's new vision of phenomenology. Many members of the Munich group distanced themselves from Husserl's idealism and his [[transcendental phenomenology]], preferring the earlier realist phenomenology of the first edition of the ''Logical Investigations''.

==Biography==
Professor Nayef Al-Rodhan began his career as a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] and [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]]. As a medical student at [[Newcastle University]], he was mentored and influenced by the renowned [[neurologist]], [[John Walton, Baron Walton of Detchant|Lord John Walton of Detchant]]. He trained in [[neurosurgery]] and conducted [[neuroscience]] research at the [[Mayo Clinic]], [[Rochester, Minnesota]] in the United States. He became Chief Resident in [[neurosurgery]] and was influenced by Thoralf M. Sundt, David Piepgrass, and Patrick J Kelly at the [[Mayo Clinic]]. He obtained a Ph.D. in 1988 for his work on the ''Characterization of Opioid and Neurotensin Receptor Subtypes in the Brain with Respect to Antinociception''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/characterization-of-opioid-and-neurotensin-receptor-subtypes-in-the-brain-with-respect-to-antinociception/oclc/170883051&amp;referer=brief_results Characterization of opioid and neurotensin receptor subtypes in the brain with respect to antinociception, Thesis (Ph.D.) - Pharmacology - Mayo Graduate School of Medicine, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, on a fellowship from the [[Congress of Neurological Surgeons]], he joined the department of [[neurosurgery]] at the [[Yale University School of Medicine]] as a fellow in [[epilepsy]] surgery and molecular neuroscience under the direction of Dennis Spencer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epilepsy.yale.edu/education/fellowships/neurosurgery/alumni.aspx Yale Epilepsy Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Nayef Al-Rodhan became a fellow at the department of [[neurosurgery]] at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] at [[Harvard Medical School]], where he worked on the study of [[neuropeptide]]s, [[molecular genetics]], and [[neuronal]] [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]]. In 1995, he was appointed to the faculty of the [[Harvard Medical School]] and while at Harvard and [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], he founded the [[neurotechnology]] program with [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[James E. Muller]]. Working with Robert Martuza, Al-Rodhan also founded the Laboratories for Cellular Neurosurgery and Neurosurgical Technology at the department of [[neurosurgery]] of Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnsr.mgh.harvard.edu/info.html Harvard Medical School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813191608/http://cnsr.mgh.harvard.edu/info.html |date=2011-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimit.org/news/neurotechnology.html Center for Integration of Medicine &amp; Innovative Technology, Neurotechnology Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609003622/http://www.cimit.org/news/neurotechnology.html |date=2015-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience awards===
Nayef Al-Rodhan has received the following research awards: Sir James Spence Prize, the Gibb Prize, the Farquhar-Murray Prize, the American Association of Neurological Surgeon Prize (twice), the Meninger Prize, the Annual Resident Prize of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons, the Young Investigator Prize of the [[American Association of Neurological Surgeons]], and the Annual Fellowship Prize of the [[Congress of Neurological Surgeons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcsp.ch/About-Us/Staff/Faculty/Faculty-Members/Dr-Nayef-AL-RODHAN GCSP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830173747/http://www.gcsp.ch/About-Us/Staff/Faculty/Faculty-Members/Dr-Nayef-AL-RODHAN |date=2011-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience and international relations===
Since 2002, Nayef Al-Rodhan has shifted his scholarly focus to the interplay between [[neuroscience]] and [[international relations]]. Through several publications,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainablehistory.com/ Sustainable history]&lt;/ref&gt; he has pioneered the application of neuroscience and the neuro-behavioural consequences of the [[neurochemical]] and cellular mechanisms that underpin [[emotion]]s, [[amorality]], [[Psychological egoism|egoism]]s, [[fear]], [[greed]], and [[:wikt:dominance|dominance]], into the analysis and conceptualization of trends in contemporary [[geopolitics]], [[global security]], [[national security]], [[Transculturation|transcultural]] security, and [[war]] and [[peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oxford.academia.edu/NayefAlRodhan|title=Nayef Al-Rodhan {{!}} University of Oxford - Academia.edu|website=oxford.academia.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Nayef Al-Rodhan joined the [[Geneva Center for Security Policy]] in Geneva, Switzerland, as a Senior Scholar in [[geostrategy]] and Director of the [[Geopolitics]] and Global Futures Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcsp.ch/Topics-Initiatives/Geopolitics-and-Global-Futures-Programme|title=Geopolitics and Global Futures Programme - GCSP|last=GCSP.CH|website=www.gcsp.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, Al-Rodhan became a Senior Member of [[St. Antony’s College, Oxford]] University, where he analyses, amongst other things, critical turning points in the Arab-Islamic world and their current and future regional and global geopolitical relevance. In 2014, he became an Honorary Fellow of St. Antony's College.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Honorary Fellows of St Antony's College, Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt; His current [[geostrategy]] interests include: [[Geopolitics]] of the [[Middle East]]; sustainable national and global security; geopolitics of [[outer space]] and strategic technologies; and global [[strategic]]   cascading risks.
His [[Philosophy|philosophical]] interests include:[[global justice]]; [[human dignity]] and [[international]] order; shared history of [[human]]ity and [[Transculturation|transcultural]] security and synergy; philosophy of [[sustainable]] history and the [[dignity]] of man; [[history of ideas]]; [[neurophilosophy]] of [[human nature]] and its implications for war, peace and moral and political [[cooperation]] between [[ideologies]], states and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablehistory.com/about-nayef-alrodhan/|title=Biography|website=SH|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10630">'''Negative consequentialism''' is a version of the ethical theory [[consequentialism]], which is "one of the major theories of [[normative ethics]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peterson|2013|page=vii}}: "Consequentialism is one of the major theories of normative ethics."&lt;/ref&gt; Like other versions of consequentialism, negative consequentialism holds that moral right and wrong depend only on the value of outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=19}}: "The whole family of utilitarian theories is captured by the equation: Utilitarianism = Consequentialism (nothing but the values of outcomes matter for the rightness of actions) + Welfarism (nothing but well-being matters for the value of outcomes)."&lt;/ref&gt; That is, for negative and other versions of consequentialism, questions such as "what should I do?" and "what kind of person should I be?" are answered only based on consequences. Negative consequentialism differs from other versions of consequentialism by giving greater weight in moral deliberations to what is bad (e.g. suffering or injustice) than what is good (e.g. happiness or justice).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “Negative consequentialism is the version of consequentialism that focuses on reducing harms. It has this focus because it assumes that there aren’t things of positive intrinsic value, while there are things of negative intrinsic value. Therefore, in deciding on whether to act in a particular way, a negative consequentialist would consider what harms it would cause, eliminate, increase or decrease.”
{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}: “Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family.”
{{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: “NU [negative utilitarianism] comes in several flavours, which I will outline later, but the basic thrust is that an act is morally right if and only if it leads to less suffering than any available alternative. Unlike Classical Utilitarianism, positive experiences such as pleasure or happiness are either given no weight, or at least a lot less weight. (In what follows, I use the word 'happiness' to stand in for whatever aspects of life might be thought to have positive value).”
&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific type of consequentialism is [[utilitarianism]], which says that the consequences that matter are those that affect well-being.{{sfn|Bykvist|2009|page=19}} Consequentialism is broader than utilitarianism in that consequentialism can say that the value of outcomes depend on other things than well-being; for example, justice, fairness, and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooker|Mason|Miller|2000|page=2}}: “Other consequentialist theories take other things to be valuable, for example justice, fairness, and equality.”&lt;/ref&gt; [[Negative utilitarianism]] is thus a form of negative consequentialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “One form of negative consequentialism is negative utilitarianism.”&lt;/ref&gt; Much more has been written explicitly about [[negative utilitarianism]] than directly about negative consequentialism, although since negative utilitarianism is a form of negative consequentialism, everything that has been written about negative utilitarianism is by definition about a specific (utilitarian) version of negative consequentialism. Similarly to how there are many variations of consequentialism and negative utilitarianism, there are many versions of negative consequentialism, for example negative [[prioritarianism]] and negative consequentialist [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “According to negative consequentialism such as negative prioritarianism, negative utilitarianism, and negative consequentialist egalitarianism...”&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. E. Moore]]'s ethics can be said to be a negative consequentialism (more precisely, a consequentialism with a negative utilitarian component), because he has been labeled a consequentialist,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaw|1995|page=46}}: “Moore is indeed a consequentialist.”&lt;/ref&gt; and he said that "consciousness of intense pain is, by itself, a great evil"{{sfn|Moore|1951 |p=213}} whereas "the mere consciousness of pleasure, however intense, does not, ''by itself'', appear to be a ''great'' good, even if it has some slight intrinsic value. In short, pain (if we understand by this expression, the consciousness of pain) appears to be a far worse evil than pleasure is a good."{{sfn|Moore|1951 |p=212}} Moore wrote in the first half of the 20th century before any of the terms 'consequentialism,' 'negative utilitarianism' or 'negative consequentialism' were coined, and he did not use the term 'negative consequentialism' himself.&lt;ref&gt;Moore died in 1958; the same year that both of the terms 'consequentialism' and 'negative utilitarianism' seem to have been coined. According to {{harvnb|Spielthenner|2005|page=231}}, "It seems that the term 'consequentialism' has been coined by E. Anscombe in her influential article 'Modern Moral Philosophy' (1958)." {{harvnb|Smart|1958}} is widely considered to have coined the term 'negative utilitarianism.'&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Moore, [[Ingemar Hedenius]] defended a consequentialism that could be called negative (or could be said to have a negative utilitarian component) because he assigned more importance to suffering than to happiness. Hedenius saw the worst in life, such as infernalistic suffering, as so evil that calculations of happiness versus suffering becomes unnecessary; he did not see that such evil could be counterbalanced by any good, such as happiness.{{sfn|Petersson|2009}}

Philosophy professor Clark Wolf defends "negative consequentialism as a component of a larger theory of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|2009|page=360}}: "For a defence of a negative consequentialism as a component of a larger theory of justice, see Wolf (1999)." That is, see {{harvnb|Wolf|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Sinnott-Armstrong]] interprets [[Bernard Gert]]'s moral system as a "sophisticated form of negative objective universal public rule consequentialism."{{sfn|Sinnott-Armstrong|2002|p=147}} Jamie Mayerfeld argues for a strong duty to relieve suffering, which is consequentialist in form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayerfeld|1999|page=116}}: "The duty to relieve suffering, I have suggested, arises from the badness of suffering." {{harvnb|Mayerfeld|1999|page=117}}: "The duty to relieve suffering is consequentialist in form."&lt;/ref&gt; He says that "suffering is more bad than happiness is good,"{{sfn|Mayerfeld|1999|p=136}} and that "the lifelong bliss of many people, no matter how many, cannot justify our allowing the lifelong torture of one."{{sfn|Mayerfeld|1999|p=178}}

'''Operation Gotham Shield''' was a 2017 exercise conducted by the United States [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) which tested [[civil defense]] response capabilities to a [[nuclear weapons]] attack against the [[New York metropolitan area]].

==Background==
[[File:Lincolntunnel.jpg|thumb|Operation Gotham Shield imagined a nuclear detonation at the New Jersey-side entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel (''pictured'').]]
Operation Gotham Shield occurred over the course of four days, from April 23 to 27, 2017, and was part of FEMA's National Exercise Program.&lt;ref name="usda"/&gt;

The operation involved the hypothetical [[ground burst]] of a nuclear device at the [[New Jersey]]-side entrance to the [[Lincoln Tunnel]], resulting in "hundreds of thousands" of killed and injured persons and 4.5  million refugees from the initial blast and subsequent [[fallout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feds prep for nuclear attack in NJ|url=http://www.fox5ny.com/news/feds-prep-for-nuclear-attack-in-nj|accessdate=January 7, 2018|work=[[WNYW-TV]]|date=April 26, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107232944/http://www.fox5ny.com/news/feds-prep-for-nuclear-attack-in-nj|archivedate=January 7, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Health Actions to Prepare for an Effective Radiological/Nuclear Response|url=https://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/webinar/slides_082417_radiological_and_nuclear_preparedness.pdf|website=cdc.gov|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=January 7, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209020326/https://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/webinar/slides_082417_radiological_and_nuclear_preparedness.pdf|archivedate=December 9, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FEMA National Advisory Council May 2017 Meeting Minutes NAC|url=https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1501859547272-a1fd534c002b3fa131d3844fd2eeafaf/2017.05_MeetingMinutes_FINAL(508).pdf|website=fema.gov|publisher=[[FEMA]]|accessdate=January 7, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108063201/https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1501859547272-a1fd534c002b3fa131d3844fd2eeafaf/2017.05_MeetingMinutes_FINAL(508).pdf|archivedate=January 8, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
Gotham Shield occurred simultaneous with several partnered exercises testing the responsiveness of different agencies of the United States in the fulfillment of their own organizational priorities as they would apply to the core attack scenario, including Vibrant Response (led by [[United States Army North]]), Prominent Hunt 17-1 (led by the [[Domestic Nuclear Detection Office]]), and ''Fuerzas Amigas'' (a joint planning event of the [[Mexican Armed Forces]] and [[United States Armed Forces]]).&lt;ref name="dota"/&gt;

Ardent Sentry 17 (led by the [[United States Northern Command|Northern Command]]), was another simultaneous operation which focused on [[military aid to the civil power]], specifically "marshalling simulated forces".&lt;ref name="gtm"&gt;{{cite news|title=Emergency-Response Training in Ardent Sentry 17|url=https://dmna.ny.gov/gt/gt_spring_17_web.pdf|accessdate=January 7, 2018|work=Guard Times Magazine|date=Spring 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108120503/https://dmna.ny.gov/gt/gt_spring_17_web.pdf|archivedate=January 8, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ardent Sentry 17 was a [[command post exercise]] with staff operating from a primary command post at the [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]] headquarters in [[Troy, New York|Troy]], and a redundancy command post at the New York National Guard Joint Force Headquarters in [[Latham, New York|Latham]].&lt;ref name="gtm"/&gt; It was overseen by GEN  Timothy LaBarge of the [[New York National Guard]] who was given "dual status command", or authority to command both State of New York and United States military forces.&lt;ref name="gtm"/&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Canada]] conducted an overlapping exercise, Staunch Maple 17, whose scenario involved simultaneous "nuclear threats" in [[Ottawa]] and [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], and which also involved the friendly intervention of U.S. military forces into [[eastern Canada]].&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite news|title=N.S. hosts nuclear emergency exercise|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1462570-n.s.-hosts-nuclear-emergency-exercise|accessdate=January 7, 2018|work=Chronicle Herald|date=April 24, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107175403/http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1462570-n.s.-hosts-nuclear-emergency-exercise|archivedate=January 7, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Military helicopters to fly low across Nova Scotia this week, including American Black Hawk|url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/halifax/2017/04/24/military-helicopters-halifax-american-black-hawk-.html|accessdate=January 7, 2018|work=Metro|date=April 24, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108063819/http://www.metronews.ca/news/halifax/2017/04/24/military-helicopters-halifax-american-black-hawk-.html|archivedate=January 8, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt; Unlike Gotham Shield, Canada's [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] did not publicly describe the scenario around which Staunch Maple 17 was based, but media outlets would later cite sources who confirmed it involved a "nuclear event" and was a test of scaled contingency plans the country had involving "a wide range of scenarios involving attacks on Canada, including a [[ICBM|missile]] attack."&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brewster|first1=Murray|title=Canada, U.S. held joint exercises simulating nuclear attack on both sides of border|url=https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/canada/canada-us-held-joint-exercises-simulating-nuclear-attack-on-both-sides-of-border/ar-BBFX4cy?li=AA59G3&amp;%252525253BOCID=HPDHP|accessdate=January 7, 2018|work=[[MSN]]|agency=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=November 30, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108062819/https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/canada/canada-us-held-joint-exercises-simulating-nuclear-attack-on-both-sides-of-border/ar-BBFX4cy?li=AA59G3&amp;%252525253BOCID=HPDHP|archivedate=January 8, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
Operation Gotham Shield was billed as a "[[false flag]]" by some conspiracy theorists, who predicted it was designed to cover up a planned, actual nuclear weapons attack against the [[New York metropolitan area]], or as distraction from a planned U.S. nuclear weapons attack against [[North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LaCapria|first1=Kim|title=What is Operation Gotham Shield?|url=https://www.snopes.com/2017/04/20/operation-gotham-shield/|website=snopes.com|publisher=[[Snopes]]|accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Faife|first1=Corin|title=Reddit’s Conspiracy Theorists Think World War III Will Begin Today|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yp7qqk/reddits-conspiracy-theorists-think-world-war-iii-will-begin-tomorrow|accessdate=January 7, 2018|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=April 25, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107175014/https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yp7qqk/reddits-conspiracy-theorists-think-world-war-iii-will-begin-tomorrow|archivedate=January 7, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] ''[[Daily Express]]'', meanwhile, propagated a different take on the conspiracy theory which hypothesized that "a major incident will happen to US President Donald Trump on Wednesday" (the date of the first day of Gotham Shield).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shock radio broadcast sparks fears Donald Trump will be attacked on WEDNESDAY|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/795823/Shock-radio-broadcast-sparks-fears-Donald-Trump-will-be-attacked-April-26|accessdate=January 7, 2018|work=[[Daily Express]]|date=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir (Paul) Patrick (Gordon) Bateson''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS}} (31 March 1938 &amp;ndash; 1 August 2017) was an [[England|English]] [[biology|biologist]] and science writer.  Bateson was a [[professor]] of [[ethology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] and president of the [[Zoological Society of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.bio.ed.ac.uk/asab/resources/profiles/bateson.html Career profiles: How I came to study animal behaviour]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/ancestors/bateson.htm Patrick Bateson interviewed by Alan Macfarlane 13 December 2007 (film)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scopus&gt;{{Scopus id}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/news/professor-sir-patrick-bateson-frs|website=zoo.cam.ac.uk|title=Professor Sir Patrick Bateson, FRS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Bateson was educated at [[Westminster School]]&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; and [[King's College, Cambridge]]&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;Anon (2017) {{Who's Who | surname = BATESON | othernames = Prof. Sir (Paul) Patrick (Gordon) | id = U6789 | edition = online [[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford}} {{doi|10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.6789}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was awarded a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[zoology]]{{when|date=August 2017}} and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] for research on [[ethology|animal behaviour]] supervised by [[Robert Hinde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|title=The Development of Filial and Avoidance behaviour in the domestic chicken|first=Paul Patrick Gordon|last=Bateson|date=1963|url=http://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/23483522?style=html|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.449192}}|website=copac.jisc.ac.uk|oclc=500380329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nobit/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bateson2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bateson|first1=Patrick|title=Patrick Bateson|journal=Current Biology|volume=25|issue=5|year=2015|pages=R180–R181|issn=0960-9822|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.12.040|pmid=25897438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==
Bateson was a biologist who specialised in researching the behaviour of animals and how it is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Patrick was a world authority on imprinting in birds — the process of learning to recognise their parents and members of their own species — and his work led to new principles in behavioural development.&lt;ref name=frs&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Patrick Bateson FRS|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815135948/https://royalsociety.org/people/patrick-bateson-11050|archivedate=2017-08-15|url=https://royalsociety.org/people/patrick-bateson-11050|website=royalsociety.org|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|location=London|author=Anon|year=2017}}

One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where:{{quote|“All text published under the heading 'Biography' on Fellow profile pages is available under [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].” --{{cite web |url=https://royalsociety.org/about-us/terms-conditions-policies |title=Royal Society Terms, conditions and policies |accessdate=2017-08-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111170346/https://royalsociety.org/about-us/terms-conditions-policies |archivedate=11 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bateson devised original experiments that showed how characteristics of imprinting depend on the bird’s early life experiences. Bateson's investigation of learning in birds has led to greater understanding of the neural basis of memory. He had an interest in how developmental and behavioural processes influence evolution.&lt;ref name=frs/&gt;

Bateson was concerned with the ethics of using animals in research and the analysis of animal pain and suffering. This led to a study into the effects on red deer of hunting with hounds, an inquiry into dog breeding and a review of the use of animals in research.&lt;ref name=frs/&gt;

Previous academic positions include a [[Harkness Fellowship]] at [[Stanford University]]&lt;ref name=nobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/batesonp.html Patrick Bateson profile], Edge.org; accessed 18 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and ten years as head of the Cambridge sub-department of Animal Behaviour. Bateson retired as the biological secretary to the Royal Society after five years and [[Master (college)|Provost]] of [[King's College, Cambridge]] after fifteen years in 2003. He retired from his Cambridge Chair in 2005.

Bateson published on such topics as ethology, [[animal welfare]], behavioral development and [[evolution]].

===Awards and honours===
Bateson was [[knight bachelor|knighted]] in 2003. He received an Honorary [[Doctor of Science]] (ScD) degree from the [[University of St Andrews]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/news/archive/2001/title,42364,en.php Honorary degrees], st-andrews.ac.uk; accessed 18 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and an Honorary Fellowship from [[Queen Mary University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qmul.ac.uk/alumni/notablealumni/honoraryfellows/ Honorary Fellows] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927032529/http://www.qmul.ac.uk/alumni/notablealumni/honoraryfellows/ |date=27 September 2016 }}, qmul.ac.uk; accessed 18 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS) in 1983.&lt;ref name=frs/&gt;

==Personal life==
Bateson's grandfather's cousin was the [[genetics|geneticist]] [[William Bateson]], and his daughter is Melissa Bateson, also a professor of ethology, at [[Newcastle University]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Bateson was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;"A confirmed agnostic, he [Bateson] was converted to atheism after attending a dinner where he tried to converse with a woman who was a creationist. "For many years what had been good enough for Darwin was good enough for me. Not long after that dreadful dinner, Richard Dawkins wrote to me to ask whether I would publicly affirm my atheism. I could see no reason why not." " Lewis Smith, 'Science has second thoughts about life', The Times (London), 1 January 2008, Pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 1 August 2017 at the age of 79.&lt;ref name=nobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardianobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Paul|title=Sir Patrick Bateson obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/aug/14/sir-patrick-bateson-obituary|accessdate=15 August 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabic word ''[[S-L-M|salaam]]'' (سلام) ("peace") originates from the [[S-L-M|same root]] as the word ''[[Islam]]''.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{OEtymD|Islam|accessdate=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Islamic interpretation is that individual personal peace is attained by utterly submitting to [[Allah]]. {{cn|date=November 2017}}

The ideal society according to the [[Qur’an]] is [[Dar as-Salam]], literally, ''"the house of peace"''  of which it intones: ''And Allah invites to the 'abode of peace' and guides whom He pleases into the right path.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/010.qmt.html Qur'an 10:25]; Lewis, Bernard, The Crisis of Islam, 2001 Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami|Ibn Hajar al-Haythami]], there will be an era in which justice, plenty, abundance, well-being, security, peace, and brotherhood will prevail among humanity, and one in which people will experience love, self-sacrifice, tolerance, compassion, mercy, and loyalty. Muhammad said{{cn|date=June 2017}} that this blessed period will be experienced through the mediation of the [[Mahdi]], who will come in the end times to save the world from chaos, injustice, and moral collapse. He will eradicate godless ideologies and bring an end to the prevailing injustice. Moreover, he will make religion like it was in the days of Muhammad, cause the Qur'an's moral teachings to prevail among humanity, and establish peace and well-being throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami|Ibn Hajar al-Haythami]], Al-Qawl al-Mukhtasar fi `Alamat al-Mahdi al-Muntazar, 23, 34, 50, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

'''''Perceiving God: The Epistemology of Religious Experience''''' is a 1991 book by the philosopher [[William Alston]]. It is one of Alston's chief works in the philosophy of religion.&lt;ref name="Plantinga" /&gt;

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
Alston, combining his interests in epistemic justification and religious language, gives a detailed account of the epistemology of religious experience,&lt;ref name="Quinn" /&gt; and argues that experiential awareness of [[God]] makes an important contribution to the grounds of religious belief.&lt;ref name="Plantinga" /&gt; He argues that religious experiences which are taken by their subjects to be direct non-sensory experiences of God are perceptual in character because they involve a presentation or appearance to the subject of something that the subject identifies as God.&lt;ref name="Quinn" /&gt;

He defends the view that such mystical perception is a source of prima facie justified beliefs about divine manifestations by arguing for the practical rationality of engaging in a belief-forming practice that involves reliance on mystical perception.&lt;ref name="Quinn"&gt;[[#Qui05|Quinn 2005]]. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Perceiving God'' was praised by the philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]].&lt;ref name="Plantinga"&gt;[[#Pla99|Plantinga 1999]]. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychological biblical criticism''' &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051212143640/http://www.aramaicnt.org/site/index.php?mode=article&amp;entry=95 Psychological Biblical Criticism: An exciting hermeneutic in the study of Scripture]&lt;/ref&gt; is a re-emerging field within [[biblical criticism]] that seeks to examine the psychological dimensions of scripture through the use of the [[behavioral science]]s. The title itself involves a discussion about "the intersections of three fields: [[psychology]], the Bible, and the tradition of rigorous, critical reading of the biblical text." (Kille, 2001). Known figures within biblical scholarship advocating this interdisciplinary field in the United States include [[Rev. D. Andrew Kille]] (2001; 2004), [[J. Harold Ellens]] (2004), [[Wayne G. Rollins]] (1983; 1999; 2004), and, in Europe, [[Eugen Drewermann]] (Beier, 2004), [[Gerd Theissen]] (1983, 1987, 2007).

Rollins was the first to define psychological biblical criticism as having the [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] intent of examining
{{quote|"... texts, their origination, authorship, modes of expression, their construction, transmission, translation, reading, interpretation, their transposition into kindred and alien forms, and the history of their personal and cultural effect, as expressions of the structure, processes, and habits of the human psyche, both in individual and collective manifestations, past and present." (1999:77–78)}}

==The worlds of Scripture==
Unlike many other forms of [[biblical criticism]], psychological biblical criticism is not a particular ''method'' for interpretation, but is rather a ''perspective'' (Kille, 2001). This approach to the biblical text seeks to complement studies on the cultural, sociological, and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] influences on scripture, by discussing the psychological dimensions of: the authors of the text, the material they wish to communicate to their audience, and the reflections and meditations of the reader. As a result, the material under study involves three dimensions of text (Rollins, 1983; Kille, 2001; 2004). 

===The world ''behind'' the text===
What was the author of the text thinking? What was their background, why were they writing? What situations drove them to put pen to paper and produce this work? What is the cultural, historical, and social context of the text? Although traditional uses of psychological theory in the study of ancient texts have sought to generate a complete psychoanalysis of scriptural writers, there has always been the hindrance of temporal and cultural distance between the analyst and analysand. Psychological biblical criticism best serves not as a [[Reductionism|reductionistic]] tool, but as another heuristic for use alongside traditional methods of historical and cultural criticism, illuminating aspects of purpose and meaning in the language and cognition of texts (Kille, 2001: 22–23; 2004: 23–25). In essence, a study of the world behind the text involves such questions as "... what makes them write the way they do and what realities, truths, and insights they want to share with us." (Rollins, 1983: 99).

===The world ''of'' the text===
Why did [[King Saul]] decide try to skewer [[David]]—his greatest warrior—with a spear? Why did [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] hand [[Jesus]] over? What is the meaning of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] Chapter 1? To analyze the world of the text is to "describe the qualities of a character as he or she is presented in the text" (Kille, 2001:24), their actions and relationships, as well as develop insight into the motivations the writer has programmed into them. Kille in particular warns that one should be wary of trying to reach beyond the world of the text to the actual historical persons, since one may accidentally perform the function of [[eisegesis]] rather than [[exegesis]]. The world of the text may also shine light on the conditions and intent of the writer. On the one hand the characters and events within the text may reflect more the writer's socio-cultural situation than actual events, while at the same time they may inform us as to what the writer desires from us—transformation, repentance, enlightenment, etc. (Kille, 2004).

===The world ''in front of'' the text===
{{quote|"... we often come to Scripture with the question 'What is this book?', but discover that this book asks us, 'Who is this that reads it?' ... Each of us carries... a set of values, a list of personal problems, a well seasoned worldview, and a large dose of humanity, wherever we go and to whatever task we undertake. When we approach Scripture we come with the same baggage. It is not possible to come in any other way."|sign=Wayne G. Rollins, 1983:98}}

How do I approach the text? What does the text ask of me? How do I respond to it? What meaning do I give to this relationship? The world in front of the text discusses the interplay between the text before our very eyes and the [[Eisegesis|eisegetical]] processes that take place within our mind. In this exchange the interest is not in the psychological world of the writer, or the original meaning of the text and the characters displayed, but in how the reader manipulates, interprets, and is filled by the text; how they make it relevant to their lives, how it "speaks" to them, and how this relationship reflects their personal world (Rollins 1983: 97–100; Kille, 2001: 25–27; 2004: 27–29).

==The Bible and psychology in transition==
{{quote|"Psychology and Biblical studies are thus inevitably interlinked, regardless of what the immediate focus or concern of either is. Hence, whether we are exploring the biblical text or the living human document, the mutual illumination of psychology and biblical studies is imperative because a properly enlightened anthropology is required for both ... Because both disciplines deal with the psycho-spiritual domains, neither of these can ignore the other or it is not adequately serious about itself."|sign=[[J. Harold Ellens]], 2004:284}}

A psychological study of the [[hermeneutical]] levels of religious texts has the capability of granting a better understanding not only of the text itself, but also of the mind that produced it, the mind that it describes, and the mind that interacts with it. This knowledge has promise for interdisciplinary application as well, by informing the field of [[religious studies]], the [[psychotherapeutic encounter]], and the [[psychology of religion]]. Hence, proponents of psychological biblical criticism argue that it has the potential of crossing the gap between psychology and religion, providing a platform for dialogue without reducing religion to mere drives and internal objects, but by discussing the aspects of this very human mode of meaning ([[J. Harold Ellens|Ellens]], 2004).

[[File:Rafi-Holland.png|thumb|150px|Raphael Cohen-Almagor]]
'''Raphael Cohen-Almagor''' received his D. Phil. in political theory from [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in 1991, and his B.A. and M.A. from [[Tel Aviv University]] (both Magna cum Laude). In 1992-1995 he lectured at the Hebrew University Law Faculty. In 1995-2007 he taught at the University of Haifa Law School, Department of Communication, and Library and Information Studies [http://www.haifa.ac.il/ University of Haifa]. He has served in various organizations, including as Chairperson of “The Second Generation to the Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance” Organization in Israel; Founder and Director of the Medical Ethics Think-tank at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100425134345/http://www.vanleer.org.il/heb/ Van Leer] Jerusalem Institute; member of the [[Israel Press Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moaza.co.il/BRPortal/br/P100.jsp |title=מועצת העיתונות בישראל |publisher=Israeli Press Council |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairperson of Library and Information Studies, and Founder and Director of [[Center for Democratic Studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cds.haifa.ac.il |title=The Center for Democratic Studies, The University of Haifa |publisher=http://cds.haifa.ac.il/|date= |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; both at the University of Haifa. Cohen-Almagor was the Yitzhak Rabin - Fulbright Visiting Professor at [http://www.law.ucla.edu/home/Default.aspx UCLA School of Law] and Dept. of Communication, Visiting Professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]], and Fellow at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]. Presently he is Chair in Politics at the [[University of Hull]], United Kingdom, and Director of the [http://www2.hull.ac.uk/fass/me-study-group.aspx Middle East Study Group]. In 2008-2009 he served as  Acting Deputy Dean for Research at Hull Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hull.ac.uk/FASS/politics_homepage/staff/prof_raphael_cohen_almagor.aspx |title=Staff - Politics - University of Hull |publisher=.hull.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Cohen-Almagor has published numerous articles and book chapters in the fields of political science, law, Israel studies, philosophy, media ethics, medical ethics, education, sociology and history. Since 2000, he is writing a [http://almagor.blogspot.com/ monthly Blog on Israeli politics],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; human rights concerns, scientific developments, the arts and other issues. The Blog, has more than 1000 subscribers in some thirty countries and was quoted by [[The Washington Post]], [[Ottawa Citizen|The Ottawa Citizen]], [[The Baltimore Sun]], among other newspapers.

== The Democratic Catch ==

Cohen-Almagor argues that one of the dangers in any political system is that the principles that underlie and characterize it may, through their application, bring about its destruction. Democracy, in its liberal form, is no exception. Moreover, because democracy is a relatively young phenomenon, Cohen-Almagor asserts that it lacks experience in dealing with pitfalls involved in the working of the system. This is what he calls the “catch” of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor, The Boundaries of Liberty and Tolerance (Gainesville, FL: University Press of Florida, 1994); Speech, Media, and Ethics: The Limits of Free Expression (Houndmills and New York: Palgrave-Macmillan, 2005); The Scope of Tolerance (London and New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen-Almagor maintains that the freedoms the media enjoy in covering events are respected as long as they do not imperil the basic values that underlie democracy. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right, an important anchor of democracy; but it should not be used in an uncontrolled manner.

== Concern and Respect ==

{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2014}}

Concern and respect are reiterated themes in Cohen-Almagor’s scholarship. He argues that we should give equal consideration to the interest of others and grant equal respect to a person’s life objects so long as they do not deliberately undermine the interests of others by interfering in a disrespectful manner. The popular culture of a democratic society is committed to seeking the influence of social cooperation that can be discerned on the basis of mutual respect between free and equal individuals. This line of reasoning should be supplemented, so Cohen-Almagor maintains, by our emphasis on the notion of concern, which is seen as the value of well-being. We ought to show equal concern for each individual’s good, to acknowledge that human beings are not only rational creations but irrational, emotional creatures. In the context of medical ethics, treating people with concern means treating them with empathy – viewing people as human beings who may be furious and frustrated while, at the same time, are capable of smiling and crying, of careful decision-making, and of impulsive reactions. Concern means giving equal weight to a person’s life and autonomy. This is a combination of mind, body, and communication between the agent and those around her bed.

== Death with Dignity ==

Cohen-Almagor is a strong proponent of physician-[[assisted suicide]] and equally strong critic of [[euthanasia]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor, [http://www.hull.ac.uk/rca/docs/articles/Outsiders_View_Dutch_Euthanasia.pdf An Outsider’s View on the Dutch Euthanasia Policy and Practice], Issues in Law and Medicine, Vol. 17, No. 1 (Summer 2001), pp. 35-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor, [http://www.hull.ac.uk/rca/docs/articles/Chabot.pdf The Chabot Case: Analysis and Account of Dutch Perspectives], Medical Law International, Vol. 5 (2001), pp. 141-159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor, [http://www.hull.ac.uk/rca/docs/articles/BMA_Statement.pdf Dutch Perspectives on the British Medical Association’s Critique of Euthanasia in the Netherlands], Medicine and Law, Vol. 20, No. 4 (2001), pp. 613-625&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor, [http://www.hull.ac.uk/rca/docs/articles/Culture_of_Death_in_the_Netherlands-Dutch_Perspectives.pdf Culture of Death in the Netherlands: Dutch Perspectives], Issues in Law and Medicine, Vol. 17, No. 2 (Fall 2001), pp. 167-179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor, [http://www.hull.ac.uk/rca/docs/articles/Should_docs_suggest_euthanasia.pdf Should Doctors Suggest Euthanasia to Their Patients? Reflections on Dutch Perspectives], Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics, Vol. 23, Nos. 4-5 (2002), pp. 287-303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor, [http://www.hull.ac.uk/rca/docs/articles/euthanasia-belgium.pdf Euthanasia Policy and Practice in Belgium: Critical Observations and Suggestions for Improvement”], Issues in Law and Medicine, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Spring 2009), pp. 187-218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor, [http://www.hull.ac.uk/rca/docs/articles/belgian_euthanasia_law.pdf Belgian Euthanasia Law - Critical Analysis], Journal of Medical Ethics, Vol. 35, Issue 7 (2009), pp. 436–439.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide. People should have the ability to control the time and place of their death. Cohen-Almagor’s thesis is that people, as autonomous moral agents, deserve to be treated with dignity. To treat a person with dignity requires respecting her choices and life decisions. 
 
Therefore, Cohen-Almagor calls to judge each case on its own merits and refrain from drawing sweeping conclusions that relate to categories of patients. One may try to prescribe detailed guidelines of conduct but, at the end of the day, the guidelines should be judged and evaluated in relation to each patient under consideration. The fear of sliding down the slippery-slope is, indeed, tangible. Cohen-Almagor prescribes cautionary measures and safety valves. Through real-life situations his plea for physician-assisted suicide is circumscribed.&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor, The Right to Die with Dignity: An Argument in Ethics, Medicine, and Law (Piscataway, NJ.: Rutgers University Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Freedom of Expression ==

Cohen-Almagor dedicates much of his scholarship to delineate the confines of free expression. He has formulated principles conducive to safeguarding fundamental civil rights. His focus is on the ethical question of the constraints on speech. He advances two arguments relating to the ‘Harm Principle’ and the ‘Offence Principle’. Under the ‘Harm Principle’, restrictions on liberty may be prescribed when there are sheer threats of immediate violence (incitement) against some individuals or groups. Under the ‘Offence Principle’, expressions which intend to inflict psychological offence are morally on a par with physical harm, so he argues there are grounds for abridging them. A case in point is the Illinois Supreme Court which permitted the Nazis to hold a hateful demonstration in Skokie. Cohen-Almagor argues that the decision was flawed. Similarly, allowing Jewish racists to march in an Arab town in Israel is flawed.&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor, [http://www.hull.ac.uk/rca/docs/articles/Skokie.pdf Harm Principle, Offence Principle, and the Skokie Affair], Political Studies, Vol. XLI, No. 3 (1993), pp. 453-470. Reprinted in: Steven J. Heyman (ed.), Controversies in Constitutional Law: Hate Speech and the Constitution (New York and London: Garland Publishing Inc., 1996, Vol. II), pp. 277-294; [http://www.hull.ac.uk/rca/docs/articles/Offense_to_Sensibilities-1.pdf The Offence to Sensibilities Argument as A Ground for Limiting Freedom of Expression], International Journal of Politics and Ethics, Vol. 2, Issue 2 (2002), pp. 101-117; [http://www.hull.ac.uk/rca/docs/articles/Offense_to_Sensibilities-2.pdf The Offence to Sensibilities Argument as A Ground for Limiting Freedom of Expression], International Journal of Politics and Ethics, Vol. 2, Issue 3 (2002), pp. 189-209.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Responsibility ==

In recent writings, Cohen-Almagor calls to strike a balance between freedom of expression and social responsibility. Responsibility is commonly associated with accountability and answerability. We live within a community and have some responsibilities to it. The responsibilities are positive and negative. That is, we have a responsibility to better the society in which we live, and a responsibility to refrain from acting in a way that knowingly might harm our community. The responsibility is ethical in nature. We can reasonably expect people to know the difference between [[good and evil]], and then to act accordingly. In the Internet context, Cohen-Almagor distinguishes between Netusers and Netcitizens. The term “Netuser” refers to people who use the Internet. It is a neutral term. It does not convey any clue as to how people use the Internet. It does not convey any appraisal of their use. The term “netcitizen”, on the other hand, is not neutral. It describes a responsible use of the Internet. Netcitizens are people who use the Internet as an integral part of their real life. That is to say, their virtual life is not separated from their real life. Even if they invent an identity for themselves on social networks such as Second Life, they do it in a responsible manner. They still hold themselves accountable for the consequences of their Internet use. In other words, netcitizens are good citizens of the Internet. They contribute to the Internet's use and growth while making an effort to ensure that their communications and Net use are constructive, fostering free speech, open access and social culture of respecting others, and not harming others. Netcitizens, asserts Cohen-Almagor, are netusers with a sense of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor, [http://cds.haifa.ac.il/articles/Responsibility-of-and-trust-in-ISPs-Final.pdf “Responsibility of and Trust in ISPs”], Knowledge, Technology and Policy, Vol. 23, Issue 3 (2010), pp. 381-396.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multiculturalism ==

To what extent can liberal democracies interfere in internal affairs of their subcultures, especially when their conduct is illiberal? This question occupies much of Cohen-Almagor’s scholarship on multiculturalism. In a piece co-authored with [[Will Kymlicka]], Cohen-Alamgor contends that if an illiberal minority is seeking to oppress other groups, then intervention is justified in the name of self-defense. Both Cohen-Almagor and Kymlicka further assert that in the case of immigrants who come to a country knowing its laws, there is no objection to imposing liberal principles on them. The situation is more complicated with national minorities, particularly if (a) they were involuntarily incorporated into the larger state (as the Palestinians claim with regard to their incorporation into the Jewish state), and (b) they have their own formalized governments, with their own internal mechanisms for dispute resolution. In these circumstances, the legitimate scope for coercive intervention by the state may be limited. 
 
Cohen-Almagor and Kymlicka maintain that there are several things which liberals can do to promote respect for individual rights within non-liberal minority groups. Since a national minority which rules in an illiberal way acts unjustly, liberals have a right - indeed a responsibility - to speak out against such injustice, and to support any efforts the group makes to liberalize their culture. Since the most enduring forms of liberalization are those that result from internal reform, the primary focus for liberals outside the group should be to provide this sort of support. Moreover, incentives can be provided, in a non-coercive way, for liberal reforms. Cohen-Almagor and Kymlicka further recommend promoting the development of regional or international mechanisms for protecting human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Will Kymlicka and Raphael Cohen-Almagor, “Ethnocultural Minorities in Liberal Democracies”, in [[Maria Baghramian]] and Attracta Ingram (eds.), Pluralism: the philosophy and politics of diversity (London: Routledge, 2000), pp. 228-250. Reprinted in R. Cohen-Almagor (ed.), Challenges to Democracy: Essays in Honour and Memory of Isaiah Berlin (London: Ashgate Publishing Ltd., 2000), pp. 89-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human Rights ==

Cohen-Almagor is a human rights and peace activist. He has written against administrative detention,&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor, [http://www.hull.ac.uk/rca/docs/articles/Administrative_Detention_Israel.pdf Administrative Detention in Israel and its Employment as a Means of Combating Political Extremism], New York International Law Review, Vol. 9, No. 2 (1996), pp. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; religious coercion,&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor, [http://www.hull.ac.uk/rca/docs/articles/Halizah.pdf Israeli Democracy, Religion and the Practice of Halizah in Jewish Law], UCLA Women's Law Journal, Vol. 11, No. 1 (Fall/Winter 2000), pp. 45-65.&lt;/ref&gt; discrimination against Arabs in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor, [http://www.hull.ac.uk/rca/docs/articles/israel-international-human-rights.pdf Israel and International Human Rights], Encyclopedia of Human Rights, ed. Frederick P. Forsythe (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), Vol. 3, pp. 247-257.&lt;/ref&gt; the 1982 Lebanon War, and the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War.&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor and Sharon Haleva-Amir, [http://www.hull.ac.uk/rca/docs/articles/WinoReport_2ndLebanonWar.pdf The Israel-Hezbollah War and the Winograd Committee], Journal of Parliamentary and Political Law, Vol. II:1 (2008), pp. 113-130.&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke in favour of separation between state and religion, women and minority rights, patients’ rights, a two state solution to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital. In 2000, he opened an international campaign to evacuate the Gaza Strip, seeing this move as the start of a Palestinian State (“Gaza First”). In late 2006 he called for early elections in Israel after he lost trust in Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the tragic architect of the Israel-Hezbollah War. This campaign ended in February 2009, when Israel held early elections that terminated the Olmert government. In 2009, Cohen-Almagor called upon Israel to institute a national enquiry commission to address all the issues mentioned in the Goldstone Report regarding Israel’s war conduct during its Cast Lead Operation (2008–2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://almagor.blogspot.com |title=Israeli Politics |publisher=Almagor.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During 2009-2011 he was engaged in a campaign which called for a prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas that would bring Gilad Shalit back home. That campaign ended in October 2011, when Gilad was united with his family, and more than 1000 Palestinians were released from Israeli jails. Since 2011, Cohen-Almagor is calling for a two state solution, believing this is the only viable and just option for both Israel and Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;R. Cohen-Almagor, Two-State Solution  The Way Forward, Annual Review of Law and Ethics, Vol. 18 (2012) and The Failed Peace Process in the Middle East 1993-2010, Israel Affairs, Vol. 18, No. 4 (October 2012), pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anti-Universalism ==

{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2014}}

Unlike most liberals, Cohen-Almagor confines his scholarship to the democratic world. He says explicitly that he is concerned with all countries around the world, because he thinks that what he says is appropriate, simply because he is realistic. Cohen-Almagor believes that there are some basic universal needs that all people wish to secure such as food, raiment, and shelter. Sexual drives are universal and people need to have some sleep to be able continue functioning. He also believes that we should strive to universalise moral principles. But sociologically speaking we cannot ignore the fact that universal values do not underlie all societies. Some societies reject the moral notions of liberty, tolerance, autonomy, equality, and justice that liberal democracies promote. If a country is not founded on these notions, then it would be futile for us to speak about these values. Thus, his practical recommendations on freedom of expression, end-of-life and multiculturalism are restricted to the democratic world.

{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Raseśvara''' was a [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] philosophical tradition which arose around the 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Pandey and Iyer, p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt; It advocated the use of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] to make the body immortal. This school was based on the texts Rasārṇava, Rasahṛidaya and Raseśvarasiddhānta, composed by Govinda Bhagavat and Sarvajña Rāmeśvara.

==Overview==
Raseśvaras, like many other schools of [[Indian philosophy]], believed that liberation was identity of self with Supreme lord [[Shiva]] and freedom from [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigration]]. However, unlike other schools, Raseśvaras thought that liberation could only be achieved by using mercury to acquire an imperishable body.&lt;ref&gt;Dash, p .38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, they called mercury pārada or the means of conveyance beyond transmigratory existence.&lt;ref&gt;Cowell and Gough. p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Extrication of soul to Raseśvaras was a cognizable act and therefore, for liberation it was necessary to maintain an imperishable bodily life. They used scriptural evidence from the [[Purusha Sukta]] and [[Puranas]] to support this point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. 141-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage of mercury==
Mercury was sacred to the Raseśvaras, so much so that they considered disparaging mercury blasphemy.&lt;ref name="page143"&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Rasahṛidaya mentions mercury to be a creation by [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati|Gauri]] whereas, Rasārṇava holds the worship of mercury to be more beatific than the worship of all symbols of supreme lord [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name="page143"/&gt; Raseśvaras described eighteen methods of treating mercury—sweating, rubbing, swooning, fixing, dropping, coercion, restraining, kindling, going, falling into globules, pulverising, covering, internal flux, external flux, burning, colouring, pouring, and eating it by parting and piercing it. Mercury could applied to both blood and body.&lt;ref&gt;Cowell and Gough, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Raseśvarasiddhānta described three modes in which mercury could be used together with air—swooning, dead and bound. Swooning mercury and air were thought to carry diseases, dead they were thought to restore life and bound they were thought to give the power of [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]].  Mercury was described as swooning when it was of various colours and free from excessive volatility. It was dead when it showed wetness, thickness, brightness, heaviness and mobility. And it was bound when it was continuous, fluent, luminous, pure, heavy, and if it parted under friction.&lt;ref&gt;Cowell and Gough, p.139&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is now known that exposure to mercury and its compounds causes hydrargyria or [[mercury poisoning]].

'''Rudolf Eisler''' (7 January 1873 &amp;ndash; 14 December 1926) was an [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]].

==Biography==
Rudolf Eisler was born in [[Vienna]] to a family of wealthy Jewish [[merchant]]s.&lt;ref name=haas&gt;Michael Haas, ''Forbidden Music: The Jewish Composers Banned by the Nazis'' (New York: Yale University Press, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a student of [[Wilhelm Wundt]], Rudolf Eisler studied philosophy at [[Leipzig University]] and earned his Ph.D. there.&lt;ref name=klemm1&gt;Eberhardt Klemm, "'I Don't Give a Damn About This Spring'" - Hanns Eisler's Move to Berlin," in ''Hanns Eisler: A Miscellany,'' ed. David Blake (New York: Harwood Academic Publishers, 1995), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[Immanuel Kant]], his philosophical writings, particularly those concerning [[phenomenalism]], were largely influenced by Wundt, as well as [[Hermann Cohen]] and [[Edmund Husserl]].&lt;ref name=dict&gt;Manfred Kuehn, "Eisler, Rudolf," in ''Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers'', ed. Stuart C. Brown, Diané Collinson and Robert Wilkinson (New York: Routledge, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon moving back to Vienna in 1901, he and his family settled in the "Matzos Quarter," a section of the city largely composed of working-class Jews. Due to his [[atheism]], he was denied a teaching position at the [[University of Vienna]].&lt;ref name=haas /&gt; He found work as an editor for a series of books on philosophy and [[sociology]] for the publisher Werner Klinkhardt. His ''Grundlagen der Philosophie des Geisteslebens'' (''Foundations of the Philosophy of the Spiritual Life'', 1908) was an installment of that series. In 1907, along with the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Max Adler (Marxist)|Max Adler]], he founded the Vienna Sociological Society.&lt;ref name=klemm1 /&gt;

Eisler described his philosophical ideas as "objective phenomenalism," which he articulated as a combination of [[empirical realism]] and [[transcendental idealism]]. With a firm understanding of the writings of Kant, his musings generally concerned the origins and construction of reality and truth.&lt;ref name=dict /&gt; In his later years, he developed an interest in [[syncretism]] and his writings turned to problems of [[cognition]].&lt;ref name=klemm1 /&gt;

His philosophical leanings were a great influence on the early education and political identities of his children and grandchildren.&lt;ref name=eisler1&gt;Georg Eisler, "My Father," in ''Hanns Eisler: A Miscellany'', ed. David Blake (New York: Harwood Academic Publishers, 1995), 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and children===
Ida Maria Fischer, the daughter of a [[Lutheran]] [[butcher]], lived with Rudolf Eisler during his studies in Leipzig. She herself was an "irregular" student at the [[University of Leipzig]]. She became known locally as a journalist and poet.&lt;ref name=haas /&gt; They were married and had three children:

*[[Ruth Fischer]] (11 December 1895 &amp;ndash; 13 March 1961): [[politician]] and co-founder of the [[Austrian Communist Party]]
*[[Gerhart Eisler]] (20 February 1897 &amp;ndash; 21 March 1968): [[politician]] and prominent member of the [[Communist Party of Germany]]
*[[Hanns Eisler]] (6 July 1898 &amp;ndash; 6 September 1962): [[composer]]

'''Susanne Bobzien''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] is a German-born philosopher,&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;Who'sWho in America 2012, 64th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; whose research interests focus on philosophy of logic and language, determinism and freedom, and ancient philosophy.&lt;ref name=yale&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/philos/people/bobzien_susanne.html Yale Faculty Page]&lt;/ref&gt; She currently is senior research fellow at [[All Souls College, Oxford]] and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name=allsouls&gt;[http://www.all-souls.ox.ac.uk/people.php?personid=2155 All Souls Faculty Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Bobzien was born in [[Hamburg]], Germany, in 1960.&lt;ref name=whoswho /&gt; 
She graduated in 1985 with an M.A. (Magister Artium) at [[Bonn University]],&lt;ref name=yaleFaculty&gt;[https://yale.academia.edu/SusanneBobzien/ Yale University Faculty Member, Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; 
and in 1993 with a doctorate in philosophy (D.Phil.) at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name=yale /&gt;

==Academic career==

Bobzien currently holds the position of senior research fellow at [[All Souls College, Oxford]] and is professor of philosophy at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name=allsouls /&gt;
She was appointed to a senior professorship in philosophy at Yale in 2001&lt;ref name=yaleDailyNews&gt;[http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2001/mar/23/philosophy-hires-rising-oxford-star/ Yale Daily News 3/23/2001, "Philosophy hires rising Oxford star"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003051121/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2001/mar/23/philosophy-hires-rising-oxford-star/ |date=3 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and held this position from 2002 to 2010.&lt;ref name=allsouls /&gt;

Bobzien has published several books and numerous articles in leading academic journals and collections.&lt;ref name=whoswho /&gt;

==Main contributions to philosophy==
===Determinism and freedom===
'''Ancient philosophy:''' Bobzien's major work ''Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy'' &lt;ref name=yaleDailyNews /&gt; is the first-full scale modern study of the Stoic theory of determinism;&lt;ref name=time2000&gt;Times Literary Supplement (15 September 2000) "Chrysippus and the seamless web"&lt;/ref&gt; 
It explores in depth the views of the Stoics on causality, fate, the modalities, divination, rational agency, the non-futility of action, moral responsibility and the formation of character.&lt;ref name=mind&gt;Mind 109 (2000) p.855&lt;/ref&gt;
In this book and in her articles "The Inadvertent Conception and Late Birth of the Free-Will Problem" and "Did Epicurus discover the Free-Will Problem?" Bobzien argues that the problem of determinism and free-will, as conceived in contemporary philosophy, was not considered by Aristotle, Epicurus or the Stoics, as was previously thought, but only in the 2nd century CE and as the result of a conflation of Stoic and Aristotelian theory.&lt;ref name=time2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=philPapers&gt;[http://philpapers.org/s/susanne%20bobzien PhilPapers archive link to Bobzien's professional papers]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kant:''' Bobzien's "Die Kategorien der Freiheit bei Kant" (The Categories of Freedom in Kant) has been described as an article "that has long been the starting point for any German reader seeking to deepen his understanding of the second chapter of [the Analytic of Kant's Critique of Practical Reason]."&lt;ref name=notreDame&gt;[http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24535-kant-s-moral-and-legal-philosophy/ Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews, 2010.11.06, of K. Ameriks, O. Höffe (eds.) Kant's Moral and Legal Philosophy, Cambridge 2009. ]&lt;/ref&gt;
It differentiates the main functions of Kant's Categories of Freedom: as conditions of the possibility for actions (i) to be free, (ii) to be comprehensible as free and (iii) to be morally evaluated.&lt;ref name=yaleFaculty/&gt;

===Ancient logic===

'''Stoic Logic:''' Bobzien's book ''Die stoische Modallogik''&lt;ref name=modallogik&gt;Die stoische Modallogik (Würzburg 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; 
is  the first monograph on Stoic modal logic.&lt;ref name=huelser&gt;K. Hülser, Die Fragmente zur Dialektik der Stoiker, vol. 3. p. VI.&lt;/ref&gt;
It presents a detailed picture of the Stoic theory of modality.&lt;ref name=knuuttila&gt;S. Knuuttila, Modalities in Medieval Philosophy, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In her paper "Stoic Syllogistic" Bobzien sets out the evidence for Stoic syllogistic. She argues that Stoic syllogistic should not be assimilated to standard propositional calculus, but rather treated as a distinct system which bears important similarities to relevance logic.&lt;ref name=reviewAncient&gt;Review of Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy XIV, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deduction:''' Bobzien's paper "The Development of Modus Ponens in Antiquity" traces the earliest development of the most basic principle of deduction, i.e. [[modus ponens]] (or Law of Detachment).&lt;ref name=yaleFaculty/&gt;&lt;ref name=phronesis&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4182708 The Development of Modus Ponens in Antiquity", ''Phronesis'' 47, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vagueness===

Bobzien has proposed a logic of higher-order vagueness that avoids both the higher-order vagueness paradoxes and sharp boundaries of the borderline zone (columnar higher-order vagueness),&lt;ref name=imprint&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/phimp/3521354.0010.010?view=toc ''Philosophers' Imprint'' 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; has provided arguments for the existence of higher-order vagueness&lt;ref name=synthese&gt;"In Defense of True Higher-Order Vagueness", ''Synthese'' 180, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and has introduced the notion of borderline nestings.&lt;ref&gt;"Higher-Order Vagueness and Borderline Nestings – a Persistent Confusion", ''Analytic Philosophy'' 54.1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Hurka''' (born 1952) is a Canadian philosopher who holds the Jackman Distinguished Chair in Philosophical Studies at the [[University of Toronto]] and who taught previously, from 1978 to 2002, at the [[University of Calgary]].&lt;ref name=uot&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Hurka|url=http://www.philosophy.utoronto.ca/directory/thomas-hurka/|work=Philosophy|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.provost.utoronto.ca/awards/uprofessors/complete/hurkat.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurka has published works on a number of topics, including the topics of goodness,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Rønnow-Rasmussen|first=Toni|title=Personal Value|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-960378-7|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[virtue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Battaly|first=Heather|title=Virtue and Vice, Moral and Epistemic|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5193-4|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Govier|first=Trudy|title=A Practical Study of Argument|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-60340-5|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy focuses on the well-rounded life. He cited that goods, which come in four basic categories - pleasure, knowledge, achievement, and virtue - matter more the less of them you have.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Quality of Life: Aristotle Revised|last=Kraut|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780198828846|location=New York|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his theory, he stressed that it is more appropriate to seek a balanced variety of them all instead of devoting oneself to one kind.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His conception of virtue is different from the view that an agent ought to maximize their own good, which requires being virtuous. Instead, Hurka stressed that "agents ought to maximize the good of all, which requires conventionally right action, and as a side effect can maximize their own good."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Virtue, Vice, and Value|last=Hurka|first=Thomas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0195137167|location=New York|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurka has also studied the ethics of fighting [[Global Warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Coward|first=Harold G.|title=Ethics &amp; climate change: the greenhouse effect|page=7|year=1993|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|isbn=978-0-88920-233-7|authorlink=Harold Coward}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that if we reject the notion that individuals should only pursue their own self-interest, then we can assign ethical standing to a wider range of beings besides ourselves.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethical Choices and Global Greenhouse Warming|last=Dotto|first=Lydia|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|year=2010|isbn=0889202346|location=Ontario|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is significant in addressing global warming because it morally pushes towards strategies of avoiding instead of adapting to climate change.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He received his DPhil from [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name=uot/&gt;

      <comment>Chinese term for "open churches"</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4960">The term '''underground church''' ({{zh|s=地下教会|p=dìxià jiàohuì}}) is used to refer to [[Roman Catholicism in China|Chinese Catholic]] churches in the [[People's Republic of China]] which have chosen not to associate with the state-sanctioned [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]]. Underground churches came into existence in the 1950s, after the [[Communist Party of China|communist party]]'s establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]], due to the severing of ties between [[Roman Catholicism in China|Chinese Catholics]] and the [[Holy See]].&lt;ref name="bays"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bays|first=Daniel|title=A New History of Christianity in China|pages=192–193|location=Malden, MA|date =2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There continues to be tensions between underground churches and "open churches" which have joined the state-sanctioned [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]] ({{zh|s=中国天主教爱国会|p= Zhōngguó Tiānzhǔjiào Àiguó Huì}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2013/11/18/do-not-abandon-catholics-in-china-cardinal-tells-church/|title=Do not abandon Catholics in China, Cardinal tells Church|last=Rocca|first=Francis X.|date=November 18, 2013|website=www.catholicherald.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The description of an "underground church" reflects language that was made popular during the [[Persecutions of the Catholic Church and Pius XII|Cold War]], when these churches came about. Underground churches are also sometimes referred to as "[[Holy See|Vatican]] loyalists" because they have attempted to remain loyal to the [[Pope]] and the [[Holy See]]. There is no established organization structure of underground churches, though they tend to be clustered around a number of Vatican-ordained bishops.&lt;ref name="leung"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese Catholic Church in Conflict: 1949-2001|last=Leung|first=Beatrice|last2=Liu|first2=William T.|publisher=Universal Publishers|year=2004|isbn=978-1581125146|location=Boca Raton, Florida|pages=91–96, 143–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, underground churches would in 1989 form the Bishops Conference of Mainland China ({{zh|s=天主教中国大陆主教团|p=Tiānzhǔjiào Zhōngguó Dàlù Zhǔjiào Tuán}}) as separate from the state-sanctioned [[:zh:中國天主教主教團|Bishops Conference of Catholic Church in China]] ({{zh|s=中国天主教主教团|p=Zhōngguó Tiānzhǔjiào Zhǔjiào Tuán}}), which was established in 1980.&lt;ref name="leung"/&gt;

Chinese Catholics associated with underground churches are often seen in contrast with the Chinese Catholics associated with the [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]], often termed "open churches" ({{Zh|c=|s=地上教会|t=|p=dìshàng jiàohuì|l=above ground church}}), which are officially independent of the [[Holy See]].&lt;ref name="bays" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joseph Tse-Hei|date=March 2007|title=Christianity in Contemporary China: An Update|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcs/article/49/2/277/764110|journal=Journal of Church and State|language=en|volume=49|issue=2|pages=278-279|doi=10.1093/jcs/49.2.277|issn=0021-969X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestant churches in China which have not jointed the state-sanctioned Protestant church, the [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]], are generally termed [[House church (China)|house churches]] rather than underground churches.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Legality ==
Underground churches in China are considered illegal, although smaller groups of fewer than 5 members are sometimes tolerated by the government.

[[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]] and [[:zh:中國天主教主教團|Bishops Conference of Catholic Church in China]] (BCCC) are often used by the government to oppress underground churches throughout China.

The underground churches used to be supported by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong]] during the term of [[Joseph Zen]].

It is not unusual that Chinese Catholics attending underground churches get arrested, detained without trial, even tortured. While there are churches for expatriates and expat Christians staying in China are allowed to have their own churches which are not interfered by the government, foreigners, including those of Chinese heritage, found involved with underground churches will be arrested and deported.

For security reason, most overseas Chinese churches, even the [[Chinese Regional Bishops' Conference]], the only Chinese Bishops' Conference recognised by the [[Holy See]] which is nowadays based in Formosa, refuse to support the underground churches in China.

==Biography==
As with most monks of the Tang Dynasty, there are conflicting lines of evidence concerning Yaoshan's life. The earliest biographical information comes from Tang Shen, who wrote Yaoshan's [[epitaph]] in 834, seven years after his death. While he is traditionally regarded as a student of [[Shitou Xiqian]], Tang Shen's inscription mentions that he stayed with [[Mazu Daoyi]] for nearly twenty years. It also mentions Shitou as his teacher, however. Some scholars consider the epitaph to be a later forgery, although many elements of it agree with other sources. A story dating to the middle of the eleventh century relates an encounter between Yaoshan and Shitou in which Yaoshan failed to awaken, but a later visit to Mazu results in his enlightenment. This is almost certainly a fanciful jibe at Shitou and praise for Mazu, however.&lt;ref name=Jin&gt;{{citation|title=The Hongzhou School of Chan Buddhism in Eighth- Through Tenth-Century China|last=Jia|first=Jinhua|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2007|ISBN=978-0-7914-6824-1|pages=28–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Meditation#No_thought|Nonthinking]]==
A story involving Yaoshan is frequently referenced in the writing of [[Dogen|Dōgen]], the founder of the [[Sōtō]] school in Japan. The story is as follows: {{quote|''Once, when the Master was sitting, a monk asked him, "What are you thinking of, [sitting there] so fixedly?"&lt;br/&gt;The master answered, "I'm thinking of not thinking (思量箇不思量底 ''sīliàng gè bùsīliàng'' [Japanese: ''fushiryō''] ''dǐ'').”&lt;br/&gt;The monk asked, "How do you think of not thinking?"&lt;br/&gt;The Master answered, "[[Meditation#No_thought|Nonthinking]] (非思量 ''fēi sīliàng'' [Japanese: ''hishiryō''])."|[[Transmission of the Lamp]]|&lt;ref name=Carl&gt;{{citation|title= Treasury of the Eye of the True Dharma, Book 66: The King of Samadhis Samadhi |last=Bielefeldt |first=Carl|publisher=Sotoshu Shumucho|year=2006|url=http://scbs.stanford.edu/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/zanmai_o_zanmai/title.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://terebess.hu/zen/yaoshan.html#a4&lt;/ref&gt;''}} 

According to [[Carl Bielefeldt]], a religious studies professor at [[Stanford University]], this passage encapsulates the essence of Dōgen's teaching on ''[[zazen]]''. Because of this, it is referenced frequently in his works, such as in the [[Shōbōgenzō]], [[Eihei Kōroku]], and most prominently his early work the [[Fukan zazengi]].&lt;ref name=Carl/&gt; 

In another passage;{{quote|''One day, as Yaoshan was sitting, Shitou asked him, “What are you doing here?”&lt;br/&gt;Yaoshan said, “I’m not doing a thing.”&lt;br/&gt;Shitou said, “Then you’re just sitting leisurely.”&lt;br/&gt;Yaoshan said, “If I were sitting leisurely I’d be doing something.''”&lt;ref&gt;https://terebess.hu/zen/yaoshan.html#a4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The epitaph records his teaching as thus: {{quote|“''The [[numinous]] mind is pure by itself, but it is obscured by phenomenal appearances. If you can dismiss all phenomena, there will be no dual things.''”}} This teaching emphasizes the pure mind of self nature, which had been a general concept since the early [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]].&lt;ref&gt;Hongzhou School of Chan Buddhism in Eighth- through Tenth-Century China, The, By Jinhua Jia&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ZenBuddhism}}

'''Zen yoga''' refers to a variety of physical and energetic practices that can be found within the [[Zen]] Buddhist tradition, and increasingly taught in the West. Some Zen temples include a taiso (exercise) period, often early in the morning, including yoga-like postures, quick repetitive exercises, and/or more flowing exercises reminiscent of [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Richard Gensho|title=Yoga Helped Me to Find the Buddha Way|journal=The Middle Way|date=May 2014|volume=89|issue=1|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exercises are designed to open and unblock the body in preparation for sitting meditation, develop a deeper awareness of the body, and as an opportunity to practice "becoming one” with what’s happening in the moment (expressed in Japanese through the terms ''narikiru'' – become one – or ''ima-koko'' – now-here).

== History and origins ==

=== Origins with the Buddha ===

The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] grew up around 500 B.C.E. in a time of great political and spiritual upheaval. The brahmanas, the spiritual orthodoxy, followed the teachings of the [[Vedas]] (written in the ninth century B.C.E.) and the [[Upanishads]] (compiled from around the seventh century B.C.E.). Ritual and offering were central to their beliefs, and these could only be performed by the spiritual caste, the Brahmins. The ritual act of making offerings was even, at times, venerated even more than the gods themselves, and as a consequence the Brahmins became very powerful and secretive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berzin|first1=Alexander|title=Indian Society and Thought before and at the Time of Buddha|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/history-culture/buddhism-in-india/indian-society-and-thought-at-the-time-of-buddha|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of ‘radical’ spiritual schools and teachers emerged (the [[shramana]] schools) in reaction to this brahmana orthodoxy (sometimes called the “movement of the forest sages”), of which the Buddha was one. What the Buddha offered was a straightforward method to alleviate suffering and lead towards liberation, accessible to people of all castes. As opposed to some of the more extreme positions that appeared (emphasising severe austerities or sensual indulgence) he taught what he called the '[[middle way]]', emphasising moderation, calmness and non-forcing.

He taught that there are no absolute "things", there are only processes in a constant state of change ([[Impermanence|annica]]); that there is no fixed or permanent essence or soul (''annata''); and that suffering is inherent to life ([[dukkha]]) (the [[Three marks of existence|Three Marks of Existence]]). In the [[Satipatthana Sutta]], the Buddha described [[Buddhist meditation#Four foundations for mindfulness|four foundations (or bases) of mindfulness]] – mindfulness of the body, of sensations, of the mind, and of dharmas (i.e. phenomena, thoughts, arisings), and is recorded as saying, "There is one thing that leads to happiness in the present and liberation in the future; and what is this one thing? It is mindfulness of the body." ([[Anguttara Nikaya]], sutta I, 21.) Thus mindfulness of the body is the direct way to liberation and the end of suffering. Zen yoga practice is primarily concerned with the body and sensations, and observing life as a process in a constant state of change, so is in direct line with the Buddha's method of awakening.

Again in the [[Satipatthana Sutta]], the Buddha says

{{quote|Furthermore, when going forward &amp; returning, he makes himself fully alert; when looking toward &amp; looking away... when bending &amp; extending his limbs... when carrying his outer cloak, his upper robe &amp; his bowl... when eating, drinking, chewing, &amp; savouring... when urinating &amp; defecating... when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, &amp; remaining silent, he makes himself fully alert.

In this way he remains focused internally on the body in &amp; of itself, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself.}}

=== Hatha and Yantra Yoga ===

[[Hatha Yoga]] emerged as a discipline in the centuries following the Buddha, tracing its origins to the Yoga-sutras written by the sage [[Patañjali]] (from the 2nd century B.C.E.) and the Goraksha Samhita (written in the 11th century by yogi [[Gorakshanath]]). The word 'hatha' in Sanskrit literally means 'force', so Hatha Yoga is the “Discipline of Force”. It stresses mastery of the body as a way of attaining a state of spiritual perfection in which the mind is withdrawn from external objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hatha Yoga|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/256851/Hatha-Yoga|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha once related his experiences with a Hatha Yoga-type breath-retention practice and found it had a great effect, but not conducive to awakening:

{{quote|...I stopped the in-breaths &amp; out-breaths in my nose &amp; mouth. As I did so, there was a loud roaring of winds coming out my earholes, just like the loud roar of winds coming out of a smith's bellows... So I stopped the in-breaths &amp; out-breaths in my nose &amp; mouth &amp; ears. As I did so, extreme forces sliced through my head, just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword... Extreme pains arose in my head... There was an extreme burning in my body... And although tireless persistence was aroused in me, and unmuddled mindfulness established, my body was aroused &amp; uncalm because of the painful exertion... But with this racking practice of austerities I haven't attained any superior human state, any distinction in knowledge or vision worthy of the noble ones. Could there be another path to Awakening?}}

The word hatha can also be seen as a combination of two separate "[[Bīja]] mantras" or single syllables – "ha" representing the masculine or solar energy and "tha" as the feminine or lunar energy. Thus Hatha Yoga is the practice of bringing balance to the two opposing forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yoga Questions Answered |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/basics/820 |website=Yoga Journal|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first occurrence of the term 'hatha yoga' is in fact found in the Buddhist [[Guhyasamāja tantra]] dating from the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berzin|first1=Alexander|title=What Is Guhyasamaja Practice?|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/vajrayana/tantra-advanced/what-is-guhyasamaja-practice|website=Study Buddhism|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yantra yoga (or [[Trul khor]]) is the Tibetan Buddhist parallel to the [[Hindu]] or Vedic Hatha yoga tradition. The discipline includes similar body postures ([[asanas]]) and [[pranayama]] practices, and includes mantra practice and visualisations. Originating with the [[mahasiddha]]s of India, it was brought to Tibet in the eighth century by the great master [[Padmasambhava]] and transmitted to the Tibetan [[Dzogchen]] master [[Vairochana]]. Its practice is nowadays found in all schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

=== Evolution into China and Japan ===

With the revival of the brahmana and caste system around the turn of the first millennium C.E. and the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent]] in the 12th century C.E., Buddhism began to decline. However, yoga and Buddhism had already spread into neighbouring countries, including Tibet and China to the north. At around 500 C.E., an Indian monk called [[Bodhidharma]] arrived in southern China and taught practices centered on physical health and wellbeing, meditation and the direct mind-to-mind transmission teachings of the [[Lankavatara Sutra]]. According to Chinese legend, the physical practices he taught monks to prepare them for meditation included a series of external exercises called the [[Luohan (martial arts)|Eighteen Arhat Hands]] (Shi-ba Lohan Shou)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garfinkel|first1=Perry|title=Buddha or bust: in search of truth, meaning, happiness and the man who found them all|date=2006|publisher=Harmony Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4000-8217-9|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an internal (energetic) practice called the Sinew Metamorphosis Classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kit|first1=Wong Kiew|title=The Art of Shaolin Kung Fu: The Secrets of Kung Fu for Self-defense, Health and Enlightenment|date=2002|publisher=Tuttle|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=0-8048-3439-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yijin Jing]] ("Muscle/Tendon Change Classic") is also attributed to Bodhidharma. As these practices developed, they led to the creation of [[Shaolinquan]] school of Kung Fu.

As the Buddhism of Bodhidharma fused with the prevailing Chinese philosophies and practices of [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]], it became [[Chinese Chán|Ch’an]] (from Sanskrit ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'', meaning "[[meditation]]" or "meditative state"). Over the centuries, Ch'an spread to Japan where it become known as [[Zen]], taking with it the rich combination of physical and energetic practices known variously as yoga, [[Qigong]], and [[Tao Yin]].

Dating back to around the fourth century C.E., [[Yogācāra]] (literally "yoga practice") is one of the two main philosophical systems that underlies [[Zen]], and includes the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] mentioned above. It contains a sophisticated psychology of awakening and emphasises the practice of mindfulness. This mindfulness leads not to an experience but to a total shift in the way we relate to all experiences. This shift is referred to in the Yogācāra tradition as parāvṛtti, "turning around”.

=== Modern Zen yoga in Japan ===

[[File:Do-zen calligraphy.png|thumb|Calligraphy brushed by Zen master Shinzan Miyamae Roshi, with the characters do-zen]]

There are three terms in contemporary Japan used to describe yoga-style movement work: do-in (from the Chinese [[Tao Yin]]), Zen taiso (literally Zen exercise), and Zen yoga (first coined by Zen master Masahiro Oki). See below for more information.

In modern times, Zen masters Hogen Daido Roshi&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openway.org.au/teachers.html#Hogen&lt;/ref&gt; and Harada Tangen Roshi,&lt;ref&gt;http://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/TangenHarada.html&lt;/ref&gt; in particular, have advocated and taught yoga practices to compliment their Zen training. One student of Hogen Daido Roshi recalls that he constantly imparted the importance of mixing moving Zen (do-zen) into Zen practice: "...there are four kinds of Zen: sitting, standing, lying, and moving. We should practise them all. Whatever we do, we must do it fully, mindfully, wholeheartedly, one thing at a time without being attached to or involved in it. When we practise moving Zen, the quality of our daily lives becomes very different.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daido Hogen Yamahata |editor=Shingan Francis Chauvet |publisher=Assirio &amp; Alvim |title=Folhas caem, um novo rebento |trans-title=Falling Leaves, a Shooting Sprout |date=2002|location=Lisbon|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Zen, the inseparability of the "body-mind" is often stressed, together with the need to retain our flexibility for life. Hogen Roshi taught that "By doing yoga and zazen, we can begin to appreciate the real state of our body and mind, both of which are stiff and unpeaceful. We should not hate them. Please, let them be as they are. Taste their special bitter taste".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daido Hogen Yamahata |editor= K. Carne|title=The Other Shore|date=1986 |location=Oxford |publisher=Parchment Press|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==

Zen practice in general, and Zen Yoga in particular, emphasize three intertwined areas – physical alignment, the flow of energy in the body and awareness or mindfulness (Japanese “nen” 念).&lt;ref name="skinner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skinner|first1=Julian Daizan|title=A View on Zen and Yoga|journal=The Middle Way|date=May 2014|volume=89|issue=1|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alignment ===

Physical alignment is highly emphasised in Zen. The founder of the Soto Zen school, Master [[Dōgen]] (d. 1253) wrote in his [[zazen]] (meditation) instructions:

{{quote|First of all, we must sit with the spine erect, not leaning left nor right, forward nor backward. The nose must be in a vertical line with the belly button and our ears are to be in level with our shoulders.}}

By practising Zen yoga we therefore prepare the body for prolonged upright sitting. Zen Master [[Shunryu Suzuki]] teaches that we must then carry this alignment out into all activities of our daily life:

{{quote|So try always to keep the right posture, not only when you practice zazen, but in all your activities. Take the right posture when you are driving your car, and when you are reading. If you read in a slumped position, you cannot stay awake long. Try. You will discover how important it is to keep the right posture... The state of mind that exists when you sit in the right posture is itself enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suzuki|first1=Shunryu|title=Zen mind, beginner's mind: [informal talks on Zen meditation and practice]|date=2011|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=1590308492|page=10|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Energy ===

One of the reasons why correct posture is so emphasised is because it powerfully influences both our mind-state and our energy. Underlying Zen is a conception of the human system as an energetic phenomenon. This energy or [[Qi|ki]] is seen as something that can be enhanced or depleted. Moreover, the courses of energy flow are not random but follow particular directions and routes called “myaku” (Jp.; or [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]]). This energy has two basic dimensions – one that influences our health, wellbeing and emotional state, and one that takes us beyond any particular state to a condition of non-dual awareness.&lt;ref name="skinner" /&gt;

We can characterise these two energetic dimensions as:
# Problem-solving – boosting our health &amp; wellbeing, making life better, and feeling more alive.
# The condition in which we realise that there was never a problem in the first place.

Energy and consciousness are inextricably linked – when we change our energy, we change our consciousness and vice versa.

One of the traditional Japanese names for yoga is do-in (from the Chinese [[Tao Yin]]), which translates as “guiding and stretching”. Through the yoga practice we stretch the body and energy routes, and guide the energy in beneficial directions. Intention is ultimately the means through which this guiding happens. The manifestation of intention may be through the breath, through imagery or simply through focused attention.

Much modern yoga practice aims to open and energise our wellbeing energy circuits (energy channels that operate in the world of opposites – left, right, back, front, etc.) without touching on the non-dual areas. Although it is a worthwhile and noble aspiration to attain optimal health and wellbeing, the practitioner nevertheless remains in the world of duality – the world of this and that, of me and the universe. Zen is emphatic that within this worldview there is no happy ending to the story of life, no liberation from our fundamental suffering. However healthy and emotionally balanced we are, we remain in a condition of separation, where the Universe is seen as huge, threatening and ultimately indifferent.

This is just a worldview. It is possible to live in a place which is beyond this duality, which is the main aim of Zen practice.

=== Awareness/mindfulness ===

The third aspect of Zen yoga is the application of awareness or mindfulness (Japanese, "nen" 念).  As mentioned above, the Buddha is recorded as saying, "There is one thing that leads to happiness in the present and liberation in the future; and what is this one thing? It is mindfulness of the body."

How do we find this happiness and liberation? Strangely enough it is through coming face-to-face with our unhappiness and reactivity – in this case as they manifest in the body. Makko-ho,&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140904185349/http://www.zencenterofdenver.org/stretches_for_zazen.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; a traditional Japanese sequence of stretches, literally means "the practice of facing things". These are a set of curative exercises originally developed from temple prostration practice in the 1930s by the pioneering Japanese yoga teacher, Nagai Wataru, then taken up and extended by Shizuto Masunaga, populariser of [[shiatsu]] massage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itmonline.org/arts/shiatsu.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important Zen master in the last 500 years, [[Hakuin|Hakuin Zenji]] had a saying that "Buddhas are like water and ordinary people are like ice". In Zen yoga practice, postures and movements are used to bring the body into focus so that we can notice any tightnesses or restrictions. The student is then directed to bring their non-judgemental attention to these blocked or closed areas, and it's this simple awareness that causes the ice to begin to melt. All we need is an attitude of curiosity and non-judgemental kindness.

Zen master [[Julian Daizan Skinner Roshi]], teacher of Zen yoga, says that "rather than causing our ice to melt into an inert puddle, this liberated water becomes more like a fountain; it has shape, dynamism and energy but nevertheless there’s an ungraspable quality."&lt;ref name="skinner" /&gt;

The [[Yogacara]] philosophy (one of the two main philosophical systems that underlies Zen) emphasises that, as the individual begins to open and become more free, flowing and dynamic, they come to inhabit a different world which takes on a similar quality.

== Practices/schools ==

=== Zen Taiso ===

As mentioned above, some Zen temples include a taiso (exercise) period somewhere within their daily (or if not, retreat) schedule. Taiso practice routines differ from popular modern yoga classes. Rather than focussing on “[[Surya Namaskara|sun salutations]]”, “warrior poses” and muscular flexibility, the quality of mindfulness and honing in on releasing energy in the body’s meridian lines is deliberately emphasised.

According to the experience of one Zen monk who studied in a variety of contemporary Japanese and Korean Zen monasteries, both monks and laity practice a variety of yoga-like practices ranging from individual stretching (lunges, hip releases, and chest openers) to temple-wide taiso routines held every morning.&lt;ref name="kane"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kane|first1=Matt Shinkai|title=Expressions of Body-based Buddhist Practice in East Asia|journal=The Middle Way|date=May 2014|volume=89|issue=1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalls "These routines focussed on consciously and mindfully relaxing areas of the body through stretching (in particular areas that needed extra care owing to long hours of sitting). The practice also worked directly with the body as one’s object of focus, and the corresponding awareness incorporated in the process, was viewed as extremely powerful.” Ultimately, the time spend doing temple yoga, both individually and as a group, was taught to be the ideal opportunity for attaining awakening ([[kensho]]) through mindfulness of the body.

In Japan, if the temple holds formal taiso sessions, they would often be held at the beginning of the day, say 4am each morning for 20-25 mins. See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyEDRWrm3nI here] for an example. At Bukkoku-ji (where Tangen Harada was the Roshi – see above), they took the form of a mixture of quick repetitive exercise (everyone counting together) with poses held for longer times. These poses were incorporated to isolate openings in for example, the stomach and spleen meridians for a back bend, the liver and gall bladder meridians for a wide-legged side bend, and so on. They were integrated with a specific purpose in mind and were to be done with awareness alongside breathing in the [[Hara (tanden)|hara]] (belly).&lt;ref name="kane" /&gt;

Temple taiso routines, however, vary according to the temple and teacher. At the [http://www.woljeongsa.org/ Weoljeong-sa] temple in South Korea, for example, the monks spend an hour or more each morning doing taiso under the direction of the lead monk while on their 3-month winter retreat.

=== Oki-do yoga ===

Oki-do yoga is a system originating with the Japanese teacher-healer-philosopher Masahiro Oki. It is a unique blend of traditional Indian hatha yoga with Zen meditation, dancing, physical games, martial arts, and chanting. The training method emphasizes balance between opposites: tension and relaxation, heat and cold, stillness and movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.okidoyoga.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

Masahiro Oki is credited as the first person to use the term "zen yoga".

=== Zenways school ===

[[File:Daizan Roshi teaching Zen yoga.JPG|thumb|Daizan Roshi teaching a Zen yoga class at the ZenYoga studio in London]]

[http://www.zenways.org Zenways] is an organisation set up by Zen master [[Julian Daizan Skinner Roshi]] in 2007 to promote and encourage activities and practices that enhance human wellbeing and awakening (satori or [[kensho]]). Zenways offers a 200hr Zen yoga teacher training course, together with meditation and mindfulness teacher training courses, workshops, retreats, meditation classes, and opportunities for zen study.

Over the years of his Zen training, [[Julian Daizan Skinner Roshi|Daizan Roshi]] studied yoga-style physical movement in Zen temples in Europe, USA and Japan. He synthesises his knowledge of these disciplines into a Zen yoga practice that combines physical challenge with mental and spiritual development. He teaches regularly at [http://www.zenyoga.org.uk “Yugagyo Dojo” (ZenYoga)], a Zen training place he established with his students in London. With more than 5000 hours of yoga teaching experience, Daizan Roshi offers a yoga teacher training programme to help teachers to find an expression that is authentically their own and will bring them success when they teach.

=== Shosan Victoria Austin ===

Shosan Victoria Austin is a Soto Zen priest transmitted in the lineage of Shunryu Suzuki Roshi. She began practicing Zen and yoga in 1971, and trained as a yoga teacher in the 1980s to bring yoga to the Buddhist community in America. A senior Iyengar yoga teacher, she emphasizes the faithful transmission of each discipline using its own language and methods. In cross-disciplinary teaching, she emphasizes teachings common to both traditions, such as bare attention; alignment of posture, breathing and intention; universal and provisional truth; dedicating the daily practice; and transformation of the causal body through applying universal moral precepts and individual practices in daily life.

=== Zenyoga association ===
Non-profit organization dedicated to practice, study and teaching of Zenyoga with headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia. 
The group goes back to the mid-seventies and was founded by Zarko Andricevic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.budisticki-centar.hr/onama.php?id=17|title=Budisticki centar Zagreb|website=www.budisticki-centar.hr|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Chan master and one of the five Western Dharma-heirs of the late Chan master [[Shifu Sheng-yen]], as an affiliate to Buddhist Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.budisticki-centar.hr|title=Budisticki centar Zagreb|website=www.budisticki-centar.hr|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Zagreb.

Zenyoga, as taught by Zarko and other longtime teachers and mentors - Mira Punik, Mirjana Halsey, Ela Vukelja and Karmen Mihalinec - is an extension of threefold training within the Chan tradition of Buddhism - that is, it aims to bring the body, breath and mind in order or harmony. It rests on the notion that "meditation in movement" is a valuable companion to "meditation in stillness" of a more formal Chan practice, especially practice of Silent Illumination&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chancenter.org/cmc/1995/02/01/shikantaza-and-silent-illumination/|title=Shikantaza and Silent Illumination|website=chancenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''mochao'' in Chinese tradition. 

Since 2003 Association runs a two-year teachers' training school consisting of over 650 contact hours, including a seven-day Chan meditation retreat. The school is registered on 500 level with Yoga Alliance since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yogaalliance.org/SchoolPublicProfile?sid=1325&amp;lid=1325|title=School Profile {{!}} Yoga Alliance|website=www.yogaalliance.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
