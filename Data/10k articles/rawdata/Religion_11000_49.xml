==Suspects==

A sketch was released of three persons of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news8austin.com/content/your_news/default.asp?ArID=266664|title=3 persons of interest in Texas church fires|last=Staff|first=News 8 Austin|date=February 12, 2010|work=TWEAN News Channel of Austin|publisher=News 8 Austin|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2010, Jason Robert Bourque, 19, of Lindale, and Daniel George McAllister, 21, of [[Ben Wheeler, Texas|Ben Wheeler]] were charged in connection with the Dover Baptist Church burning on February 8. Their bond was set at $10&amp;nbsp;million. Because they targeted places of worship, the crime is a first-degree felony carrying a maximum penalty of 99 years to life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/22/us/22webchurch.html 2 Men Charged in Texas Church Fire] by Derrick Henry for ''[[The New York Times]]'', published February 21, 2010; retrieved 6 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourque was raised by his devout Christian maternal grandparents, while McAllister was homeschooled for religious reasons. Both men had started to question their faith, Bourque following his dropping-out from the [[University of Texas]], and McAllister after the death of his mother and trouble finding work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/us/02church.html | work=The New York Times | first=James C. | last=McKinley Jr | title=From Churchgoer to Charges as Church Burner | date=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searches of their homes found documents relating to [[Satanism]], of which symbolism such as upside-down crosses were found at the burned churches.&lt;ref  name=torch/&gt;

Faced with overwhelming evidence, both men pleaded guilty. On January 14, 2011, Judge Christi Kennedy sentenced Bourque to life and 20 years in prison, and McAllister to a life sentence.&lt;ref name="houstonpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2011/01/jason_bourque_and_daniel_mcall.php|title=Jason Bourque and Daniel McAllister: East Texas Church Arsonists Sentenced to Life &amp;#124; Houston Press|publisher=blogs.houstonpress.com|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2011, Bourque was interviewed by [[KLTV]] 7 from [[Smith County Jail]]. He blamed the drug [[Chantix]], which he used to aid his quitting smoking, for psychotic episodes. He also claimed that McAllister had led the wave, targeting churches as he found them corrupt. Bourque stated that God had forgiven him.&lt;ref name="kltv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.kltv.com/#!/newsDetail/14029101|title=KLTV|publisher=m.kltv.com|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two have been profiled in ''Torchered Minds'', a book about serial arsonists.&lt;ref name=torch&gt;{{cite book|title=Torchered Minds|author=Nordskog, E.|date=2011|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=9781465375544|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vd5QAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=24 October 2014}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abraham Isaac Kook ''' ({{Lang-he-n|אברהם יצחק הכהן קוק}} ''Abraham Yitshak ha-Kohen Kuk''; 7 September 1865 – 1 September 1935) was an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbi, the first [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] [[chief rabbi]] of British [[Mandatory Palestine]], the founder of [[Yeshiva]] [[Mercaz HaRav Kook]] (The Central Universal Yeshiva), a Jewish [[Intellectual|thinker]], [[Halakha|Halakhist]], [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]], and a renowned [[Torah]] scholar. He is known in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as {{hebrew|הרב אברהם יצחק הכהן קוק}} '''HaRav Avraham Yitzchak [[Kohen|HaCohen]] Kook''', and by the [[acronym]] {{hebrew|הראיה}}  ('''HaRaAYaH'''), or simply as '''HaRav'''. He was one of the most celebrated and influential rabbis of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hidden Diaries and New Discoveries: The Life and Thought of Rabbi A. I.

His father, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Ha-Cohen Kook, was a student of the [[Volozhin yeshiva]], the "mother of the [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] [[yeshiva]]s",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William B.

As a child he gained a reputation of being an ''[[ilui]]'' ([[child prodigy|prodigy]]). He entered the [[Volozhin Yeshiva]] in 1884 at the age of 18, where he became close to the ''[[rosh yeshiva]]'', Rabbi [[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin]] (the ''Netziv''). Although he stayed at the yeshiva for only a year and a half, the Netziv has been quoted as saying that if the Volozhin yeshiva had been founded just to educate Rav Kook, it would have been worthwhile. During his time in the yeshiva, he studied under Rabbi [[Eliyahu David Rabinowitz-Teomim]] (also known as the ''Aderet''), the rabbi of [[Ponevezh]] (today's [[Panevėžys]], [[Lithuania]]) and later Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi of [[Jerusalem]].  In 1886 he married Batsheva, the daughter of the Aderet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hevratpinto.org/tzadikim_eng/143_rabbi_eliyahu_david_rabinowitz.html|title=Rabbi Eliyahu David Rabinowitz-Teomim • “The Aderet”|website=www.hevratpinto.org|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelehrhaus.com/scholarship/the-hasidism-of-rav-kook/|title=The Hasidism of Rav Kook {{!}} The Lehrhaus|website=www.thelehrhaus.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ravkooktorah.org/timeline.htm|title=Rabbi Abraham Isaac HaKohen Kook (1865-1935)|website=www.ravkooktorah.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
In 1887, at the age of 23,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/opinions/rav-kook-from-the-pages-of-the-jewish-press-in-1961/2017/08/25|title=Rav Kook, From The Pages Of The Jewish Press In 1961|first=Hillel|last=Fendel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kook entered his first rabbinical position as rabbi of [[Žeimelis|Zaumel]], Lithuania.&lt;ref name=ShamBook/&gt;{{rp|p.18}}&lt;ref&gt;also spelled Zoimel, described in the book as a village&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888, his wife died, and his father-in-law convinced him to marry her cousin, Raize-Rivka, the daughter of the Aderet's twin brother. Rabbi Kook's only son, [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]], was born in 1891 to Rabbi Kook and his second wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/outershiur.asp?id=3656
|title=The Life of Tzadikim: Harav Tzvi Yehuda Kook  |website=yeshiva.co}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, Rav Kook became the rabbi of [[Bauska Jewish community|Bauska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2676-bausk 
|title=BAUSK or BAUSKE |website=Jewish Encyclopedia (1906, public domain)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ShamBook/&gt;{{rp|p.22}}&lt;ref&gt;also spelled Boisk; described as a city&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1901 and 1904, he published three articles which anticipate the philosophy that he later more fully developed in the Land of Israel. Kook personally refrained from eating meat except on the Sabbath and Festivals; and a compilation of extracts from his writing, compiled by his disciple [[David Cohen (rabbi)|David Cohen]], known as "Rav HaNazir" (or "the Nazir of Jerusalem")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/16997|title=The Nazir of Jerusalem|website=Israel National News|language=en|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and titled by him "A Vision of Vegetarianism and Peace," depicts a progression, guided by Torah law, towards a vegetarian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/AVisionOfVegetarianismAndPeace/AVisionOfVegetarianismAndPeace_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "A Vision of Vegetarianism and Peace" |website=Archive.org |date=1985-04-20 |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Vision of Vegetarianism and Peace|url=http://www.jewishveg.com/DSvision.html|publisher=Jewish Vegetarians of North America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jaffa ==
In 1904,&lt;ref&gt;"After serving as rabbi in the small town of Zoimel and later in the city of Boisk (Bauska), Latvia, in 1904 Rabbi Kook accepted 
the invitation of the port city of Jaffa ..."{{cite web 
|url=http://orot.com/rav-kook  |title=Rav Kook - Orot  |website=orot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rav Kook moved to [[History of Palestine#Ottoman era|Ottoman Palestine]] to assume the rabbinical post in [[Jaffa]] (Yafo), which also included responsibility for the new mostly secular Zionist agricultural settlements nearby. During these years he wrote a number of works, most published posthumously, most notably a lengthy commentary on the [[Aggadot]] of [[Tractates]] [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot ]] and [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]], titled ''Eyn Ayah'', and a brief book on morality and spirituality, titled ''Mussar Avicha''. 
Another book, a collection of his letters called ''Igrot  Hareiyah'', incorporated the acronym of his name, Abraham Isaac. 

It was in 1911 that Rav Kook also maintained a correspondence with the [[Jews of Yemen]], addressing some twenty-six questions to "the honorable shepherds of God's congregation" (Heb. {{hebrew|כבוד רועי עדת ד}}) and sending his letter via the known Zionist emissary, Shemuel Yavneʼeli. Their reply was later printed in a book published by Yavneʼeli.&lt;ref&gt;Aharon Gaimani, "Scholars of Yemen Answer Questions of Rabbi A.I. Kook", in: ''Ascending the Palm Tree – An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage'', Rachel Yedid &amp; Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, pp. 88–125 {{OCLC|1041776317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Masa le-Teiman," by Shmuel Yavne'eli, pp. 187–188; 196–199, Tel-Aviv 1952 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; Rav Kook's influence on people in different walks of life was already noticeable, as he engaged in [[kiruv]] ("Jewish outreach"), thereby creating a greater role for [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]] in the life of the city and the nearby settlements. In 1913 Rav Kook led a delegation of rabbis, including several leading rabbinic figures such as [[Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld|Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld]], to the many newly established secular "moshavot" (settlements) in [[Samaria]] and [[Galilee]]. Known as the "Journey of the Rabbis" the rabbis' goal was to strengthen Shabbat observance, Torah education, and other religious observances, with an emphasis on the giving of 'terumot and ma'asrot' (agricultural [[Tithes in Judaism|tithes]]) as these were farming settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/10941|title=1913: Rabbi Kook Leads Rabbis' Tour of the Moshavot|website=Israel National News|language=en|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== London and World War I ==
The outbreak of the [[First World War]] caught Rav Kook in [[Europe]], and he was forced to remain in [[Switzerland]] and [[London]] for the remainder of the war. In 1916, he became rabbi of the Spitalfields Great Synagogue ([[Machzike Hadath]], "upholders of the law"), an immigrant Orthodox community located in [[Brick Lane]], [[Spitalfields]], [[London]], living at 9 Princelet Street Spitalfields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2013/12/rav-kook-in-london/ |title=Blog Archive » Rav Kook in London |website=OzTorah.com |date=2013-12-22 |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ravkooktorah.org/PSALM43.htm |title=Rav Kook on Psalm 43: The London Bomb Shelter |website=Ravkooktorah.org |date=1915-01-19 |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem ==
Upon returning in 1919,&lt;ref name=ShamBook/&gt;{{rp|p.44}} he was appointed the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Jerusalem]], and soon after, as first Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Palestine in 1921. 

In 1924, Rav Kook founded a yeshiva, [[Mercaz HaRav Kook]] (popularly known as "Mercaz HaRav"), in [[Jerusalem]]. Rav Kook decided to name the Yeshiva "Mercaz HaRav" to represent his vision of the Yeshiva being a place where the "Rav," or "many", could come to learn from all corners of the World. 

The deans ([[rosh Yeshiva|Roshei Yeshiva]]) following his passing in 1935 included: Rabbi [[Yaakov Moshe Charlap]], Rabbi Nosan Ra'anan, Rav Kook's son, [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]], Rabbi [[Avraham Shapira]], and Rabbi [[Yaakov Shapira]].

Rav Kook was a master of Halakha in the strictest sense, while at the same time possessing an unusual openness to new ideas. This drew many religious and nonreligious people to him, but also led to widespread misunderstanding of his ideas. He wrote prolifically on both Halakha and Jewish thought, and his books and personality continued to influence many even after his death in Jerusalem in 1935, reflected in attendance of his funeral by an estimated 20,000 mourners.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Affairs, in ''Report by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the Council of the League of Nations on the Administration of Palestine and Trans-Jordan for the year 1935'' by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the Council of the League of Nations on the administration of Palestine and Trans-Jordan for the year 1935, The Office of High Commissioner for Palestine and Trans-Jordan, Jerusalem, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

Rav Kook tried to build and maintain channels of communication and political alliances between the various Jewish sectors, including the secular Jewish [[Zionism|Zionist]] leadership, the Religious Zionists, and more traditional non-Zionist [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]]. He believed that the modern movement to re-establish a Jewish state in the land of Israel had profound theological significance and that the Zionists were agents in a heavenly plan to bring about the messianic era. Per this ideology, the youthful, secular and even [[antireligion|anti-religious]] [[Labor Zionism|Labor Zionist]] pioneers, ''halutzim'', were a part of a grand Divine process whereby the land and people of Israel were finally being redeemed from the 2,000-year exile (''[[Jewish diaspora|galut]]'') by all manner of Jews who sacrificed themselves for the cause of building up the physical land, as laying the groundwork for the ultimate spiritual [[Jewish messiah|messianic]] redemption of world Jewry.

==Inauguration of Hebrew University==

In 1928, Rav Kook wrote a letter to Rav Yosef Messas (Chief Rabbi in [[Algeria]]), addressing certain misquotes which were erroneously being repeated in his name regarding a speech he gave at the inauguration of [[Hebrew University]]. The following are translated excerpts from the letter Rav Kook wrote to Rav Messas:

{{blockquote|
"...from the time that I came to the Holy Land, it has been my goal to the best of my ability to draw also those who are estranged and speak to their heart, so that they will come close to Torah and mitzvot – including even those young people who want to develop their physical health so that they will have the strength to protect our holy nation in times of violence, Heaven forbid, at a time when vicious enemies rise up against us...in regard to Hebrew University, Heaven forbid that I should say regarding secular studies that 'From Zion will come forth Torah.'

To the contrary, I told them explicitly that I am afraid lest there come forth, Heaven forbid, a stumbling block from their hands if they reject the Torah and the fear of G-d and 'please themselves in the brood of aliens' [i.e., studies antithetical to Torah such as Biblical Criticism]. I brought them examples of this from the past, from the incidents that took place due to people’s sins [during the Berlin Enlightenment], from which came forth groups that turned away from G-d and abandoned the source of living waters. But they must guard the holiness of Israel, teachers and students alike, and not follow foreign ideas nor turn aside from the Torah and the mitzvos. And even then, it is not from secular subjects that Torah will come forth, but rather when we support the holy yeshivas, which are dedicated solely to the holiness of the Torah.

Together with this, [I told them that] they should elevate the power of the tzaddikim and Torah giants who fear G-d. And the Central Yeshiva [Mercaz HaRav] in our holy and beautiful city, which we are toiling to establish and expand with G-d’s help, will stand in its great glory. Then, upon the foundation of the holy yeshivas, I said that the verse 'From Zion will come forth Torah' will be fulfilled.

These words are explicit in my speech that I spoke at that time before the people, before all of the important officials who came to the celebration, and to the entire great crowd of thousands who came from the far ends of the Holy Land and from the lands of the Diaspora. So how can malicious people come to distort the words of the living G-d in a way that is so filled with wickedness and folly?..."}}

==Theodor Herzl eulogy==

In 1904, Rav Kook wrote a letter to his father-in-law, Rabbi [[Eliyahu David Rabinowitz-Teomim]] (also known by the acronym "The Aderet"), addressing certain misquotes which were erroneously being repeated in his name regarding a speech he gave after [[Theodor Herzl]]'s passing. The following are translated excerpts from the letter Rav Kook wrote to Rav Rabinowitz-Teomim:

{{blockquote|...Now, two gentlemen came to me… and requested me … since they were planning to gather in the bank building here to honor the memory of [[Theodor Herzl|Dr. Herzl]] and it was their finding that even those opposed to Zionism would not deny that there were in his heart thoughts concerning the betterment of Israel. Although unfortunately [Herzl] did not find the straight path, nevertheless, 'The Holy One does not withhold credit for even good talk.' It would be poor manners not to arrange a memorial in his honor in a public meeting place, such as the [[Bank Leumi|Anglo-Palestine Bank]] here. Therefore I promised them I would attend.

Understandably, once I agreed to come, I did not want to refuse to speak some words. I assessed that, God willing, benefit would derive from my words, inasmuch as the other speakers would not have the audacity to belittle God, His Torah, and the sages of Israel.

Thank God, this assessment proved correct. Of course, I spoke pleasantly and politely, but I did reveal the fundamental failure of their [the Zionists’] entire enterprise, namely the fact that they do not place at the top of their list of priorities the sanctity of God and His great name, which is the power that enables Israel to survive ... In my remarks, I offered no homage to Dr. Herzl per se.

What I did say was that such a thought of improving the situation of Israel in [[Eretz Israel]] would be worthwhile if we would rise to the occasion. It would require return to G-d by observing and honoring the Torah, and a consensus that the foundation of all must be the power of Torah. Repenting of baseless hatred, and wholehearted peace-seeking as obligated [by Torah] would result in success because it would be close to G-d’s will. We must make amends toward the future that the power of the sanctity of Torah be at the top of our list of priorities, that "the son of Yishai lead." If the will to improve materially will rest on Torah – then God will shine His face upon us and crown our every deed with success. At first, the salvation will be gradual, as our holy Rabbis remarked upon witnessing daybreak over the valley of Arbel, but after it will gain momentum, appearing as a great and wondrous light, as in the days of our Exodus from Egypt.

After [the address], others came to me and reported that some people read into my words ideas that I never intended ...}}

His empathy towards the non-religious elements aroused the suspicions of many opponents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yoel-ab.com/katava.asp?id=83 |title=אזמרך בלאמים - התיחסות גדולי ישראל לראי'&amp;#39;ה קוק ולספרו '&amp;#39;אורות'&amp;#39; |website=Yoel-ab.com |date=1996-06-19 |accessdate=2016-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208064858/http://yoel-ab.com/katava.asp?id=83 |archivedate=2015-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly that of the traditional rabbinical establishment that had functioned from the time of [[Turkey]]'s control of greater Palestine, whose paramount leader was Rabbi [[Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld]]. However, Rav Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld and Rav Kook deeply revered each other, which is evidenced by their respectful way of addressing each other, and the honor which they showed each other (as recorded in photos).

Rav Kook remarked that he was fully capable of rejecting, but since there were enough practicing rejection, he preferred to fill the role of one who embraces. However, Rav Kook was critical of the secularists on certain occasions when they violated Halacha (Jewish law), for instance, by not observing the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] or [[kashrut|kosher]] laws, or ascending the [[Temple Mount]].

Rav Kook wrote rulings presenting his strong opposition to people ascending the Temple Mount, due to the Jewish Laws of impurity. He felt that Jews should wait until the coming of the Messiah, when it will be encouraged to enter the Temple Mount. However, he was very careful to express the fact that the [[Western Wall|Kotel]] and the Temple Mount were holy sites that belong to the Jewish people. 

Rav Kook also opposed the secular spirit of the [[Hatikvah]] anthem, and penned another anthem with a more religious theme entitled [[haEmunah]].

==Legacy==
While Rabbi Kook is exalted as one of the most important thinkers in mainstream [[Religious Zionism]], there are several prominent quotes in which Rav Kook is quite critical of the more modern-orthodox Religious Zionists ([[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]), whom he saw in some ways as naive and perhaps hypocritical in attempting to synthesize traditional Judaism with a modern and largely secular ideology.
Rav Kook never shied away from gently offering constructive criticism to his peers, religious and secular. Rav Kook was interested in outreach and cooperation between different groups and types of Jews, and saw both the good and bad in each of them. His sympathy for them as fellow Jews and desire for Jewish unity should not be misinterpreted as any inherent endorsement of all their ideas. That said, Rav Kook's willingness to engage in joint-projects (for instance, his participation in the Chief Rabbinate) with the secular Zionist leadership must be seen as differentiating him from many of his traditionalist peers. In terms of practical results, it would not be incorrect to characterize Kook as being a Zionist, if one defines a Zionist as one who believes in the re-establishment of the Jewish people as a nation in their ancestral homeland. Unlike other Zionist leaders, however, Kook's motivations were purely based on [[Halakha|Jewish law]] and Biblical prophecy.

The [[Israel]]i [[moshav]] [[Kfar Haroeh]], a settlement founded in 1933, was named after Rav Kook, "Haroah" being a Hebrew acronym for "HaRav Avraham HaCohen". His son [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]], who was also his most prominent student, took over teaching duties at Mercaz HaRav after his death, and dedicated his life to disseminating his father's writings. Many students of Rav Kook's writings and philosophy eventually formed [[Hardal]] [[Religious Zionist]] movement which is today led by rabbis who studied under Rav Kook's son at Mercaz HaRav.

In 1937, [[Yehuda Leib Maimon]] established [[Mossad Harav Kook]], a religious research foundation and notable publishing house, based in Jerusalem. It is named after Rabbi Kook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosadharavkook.com/ |title=מוסד הרב קוק &amp;#124; בית היוצר הגדול לספר התורני |website=Mosadharavkook.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support from rabbinic scholars==
With the sudden public display of rare letters from the greatest Jewish scholars to Rav Kook, many questions have emerged. Rav Kook wrote that he was not part of any party – he simply viewed himself as a follower of God and the laws of the Torah. His relationship with many different types of leaders and laymen, was a part of his general worldview – that all Jews must work together in serving God and bringing the redemption. Also, one could see from the published letters, that the "Chareidi" leadership was firm in its support of Rav Kook, and in fact had an apparent fond relationship with him. The vast majority of the "Chareidi" leaders publicized handwritten letters in support of Rav Kook, when a few individuals were publicly disrespectful towards him. Rav Kook embraced the support, but made clear that any insults were accepted by him without anger, for he viewed himself "as a servant of G-d," without interest in his personal honor.

Some examples of greetings in letters written by Jewish leaders to Rav Kook:

'''''Rav [[Chaim Ozer Grodzinski]]''': "Our friend, the gaon, our master and teacher, Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Kook, shlita"'' and "The Glory of Honor, My Dear Friend, Ha-Rav Ha-Gaon, Ha-Gadol, the Famous One... The Prince of Torah, Our Teacher, Ha-Rav Avraham Yitzchak Ha-Cohain Kook Shlit”a..."&lt;ref&gt;Bisdeh Ha-Re'eiyah p. 236, Chayei Ha-Re'eiyah pp. 388-389, Igrot Le-Re'eiyah #316 and Melachim Kivnei Adam pp. 106-107. Maran Ha-Rav's response is found in Shut Da'at Cohain #223&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rav [[Boruch Ber Leibowitz]]''': "The true gaon, the beauty and glory of the generation, the tzaddik, his holiness, Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak, may his light shine, may he live for length of good days and years amen, the righteous cohen, head of the beis din [court] in Jerusalem, the holy city, may it soon be built and established"''

'''''Rav [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]] of Lubavitch''': "The Gaon who is renowned with splendor among the Geonim of Ya’akov, Amud HaYemini, Patish HaChazak..."

'''''Rav [[Chatzkel Abramsky]]''': "The honored man, beloved of Hashem and his nation, the rabbi, the gaon, great and well-known, with breadth of knowledge, the glory of the generation, etc., etc., our master Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Hacohen Kook, shlita, Chief Rabbi of the Land of Israel and the head of the Beis Din in the holy city of Jerusalem"''

'''''Rav [[Yitzchok Hutner]]''': "The glorious honor of our master, our teacher and rabbi, the great gaon, the crown and sanctity of Israel, Maran [our master] Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Hacohen Kook, shlita!"''

'''''Rav [[Isser Zalman Meltzer]] and Rav [[Moshe Mordechai Epstein]]''': "Our honored friend, the great gaon and glory of the generation, our master and teacher, Avraham Yitzchak Hacohen, shlita"''

===Quotes===
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;'''על-כן הצדיקים הטהורים אינם קובלים על החושך, אלא מוסיפים אור; אינם קובלים על הרשעה, אלא מוסיפים צדק; אינם קובלים על הכפירה, אלא מוסיפים אמונה; אינם קובלים על הבערות, אלא מוסיפים חכמה.'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Therefore, the pure righteous do not complain of the dark, but increase the light; they do not complain of evil, but increase justice; they do not complain of heresy, but increase faith; they do not complain of ignorance, but increase wisdom. (From "Arpilei Tohar", p.&amp;nbsp;27–28)

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;'''יש בן חורין שרוחו רוח של עבד, ויש עבד שרוחו מלאה חירות; הנאמן לעצמיותו – בן חורין הוא, ומי שכל חייו הם רק במה שטוב ויפה בעיני אחרים – הוא עבד.'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There could be a freeman with the spirit of the slave, and there could be a slave with a spirit full of freedom; whoever is faithful to himself – he is a freeman, and whoever fills his life only with what is good and beautiful in the eyes of others – he is a slave.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3899">'''Bedwardism''', more properly the '''Jamaica Native Baptist Free Church''', was a religious movement of [[Jamaica]]. It was founded in [[August Town]], [[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica|Saint Andrew Parish]], in 1889 by Harrison "Shakespeare" Woods, an [[African-American]] emigrant to Jamaica, and named for [[Alexander Bedward]] (1848–1930&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jnht.com/site_bedwards_tomb.php Bedward’s Tomb].&lt;/ref&gt;), who was referred to as "That Prophet" and "Shepherd." It was one of the most popular Afro-Jamaican politico-religious movements from the 1890s to the 1920s. Bedwardism attracted tens of thousands of followers with a call for [[social justice]], as well as [[socioeconomic]] programs for the lower classes.

Bedwardian literature describes Bedwardism as a new religion, the successor to Christianity and Judaism. Its actual teachings differ little from those of most Christian denominations, stressing the importance of recognizing [[Jesus Christ]] as both God and man in part of the [[Trinity]], as well as frequent fasting.  Even so, because the movement likened the ruling classes to the [[Pharisees]], it met with disapproval and even suppression by them. One of the few unique concepts of Bedwardism is the belief that Augustown, Jamaica corresponds to [[Jerusalem]] for the Western world.

The movement lost steam in 1921 after Bedward and hundreds of his followers marched into Kingston, where he failed to deliver on his claim to ascend into Heaven, and many were arrested.

[[File:De Bokkenrijder of het skelet.jpg|thumb|A 1919 poster for [[Frederik van Eeden]]'s play ''De Bokkenrijder'']]

The '''Buckriders''' ({{lang-nl|Bokkenrijders}}, {{lang-fr|Les Chevaliers du Bouc}}), are a part of Belgian and Dutch [[folklore]], [[ghost]]s or [[demon]]s, who rode through the sky on the back of flying goats provided to them by [[Satan]]. During the 18th century, groups of thieves and other criminals co-opted the belief to frighten the inhabitants of southern [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]], a province in the southern part of the [[Netherlands]] and easthern [[Belgium]]. Using the name "Bokkenrijders", these criminal bands launched raids across a region that includes southern Limburg, and parts of [[Germany]] and the Netherlands (parts of which were a part of the [[Southern Netherlands]], nowadays Belgium). Commonly, the "Bokkenrijders" raided peaceful communities and farms. Several confessed "Bokkenrijders" were convicted and sentenced to death. Because of the link to the [[occult]], authorities accused a large number of potentially innocent men of being "Bokkenrijders" and a number were tortured and subsequently convicted of crimes they denied having committed.

==Etymology==
Formally, the name ''Bokkenrijders'' was first publicly used in 1774, during the 'trial of [[Wellen]]', a town in the Belgian province of Limburg. Johan van Muysen slid a letter underneath the door of a farmer called Wouters. The letter contained a threat that Wouters's house would be burned down if Johan did not receive some money. Van Muyses claimed to be member of the buckriders and used the word [[Satan]] up to three times. In the trial of Wellen, the term buckriders is openly used against Philip Mertens, somebody who wrote a letter that resembled the letter of Johan.

==History==
[[Image:Schaesbergbeeld.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of a goat rider on the marketplace in [[Schaesberg]].]]
Earliest records mentioning the buckriders originate from a tome called ''Oorzaeke, bewys en ondekkinge van een goddelooze, bezwoorne bende nagtdieven en knevelaers binnen de landen van Overmaeze en aenpalende landstreeken'', which approximately translates to ''Causes, proof and discovery of a godless, averted gang of night thieves and gaggers within the lands of 'Overmaas' and adjacent regions.'' This book was written in 1779 by S.J.P. Sleinada (real name Pastor A. Daniels). This pastor, who lived in Landgraaf, knew several buckriders personally. The author tells us that these robbers made a pact with the [[Satan|Devil]] and rode their bucks at night. The common people told stories about them flying through the sky, pronouncing the following spell: 'Over huis, over tuin, over staak, en dat tot Keulen in de wijnkelder!' (across houses, across gardens, across stakes, even across [[Cologne]] into the wine cellar!). Once a year, they would visit their master, the Devil, on the 'Mookerheide'.

Later on, the buckriders held a reputation that resembles [[Robin Hood]] and his gang. Present interpretation is that a number of criminal gangs robbed houses and committed other crimes, using the myth in their advantage. Also, many of the buckriders that were arrested are thought to be innocent, as confessions were obtained through torture.

==Raids and raiders==
In Limburg, the buckriders nowadays embrace their cultural heritage.
Trials against buckriders differed from 'common trials against common criminals' if the suspect had performed a godless oath: 'I forswear God ... etc.' This so-called oath of heresy is a stereotypical aspect of the buckriders myth. Since the convicts were accused of their oath and pact with the devil, we can define this as a late form of [[witch-hunt]]. Prosecution of buckriders was as ruthless as the buckriders were themselves, even by those day's standards. 90% of the convicts received capital punishment. Confessions were given by means of torture, or by fear for it.

There are 7 periods of different buckrider raids. The first took place during 1743 - 1745, and the last during 1793 - 1794.

===Known associated deaths===
* [[Gabriel Brühl|Gabriël Brühl]] - sentenced to death by hanging, 10 September 1743.
* Geerling Daniels - died of two self-inflicted stab wounds, 28 January 1751.
* Joseph Kirchhoffs - sentenced to death by hanging, 11 May 1772.
* Joannes Arnold van de Wal ("Nolleke van Geleen") - sentenced to death by hanging, 21 September 1789.

==Buckriders and witch-hunts==
The fact that the buckriders were tried and prosecuted for their pact with the devil, resembles the witch-hunts during the Early Modern Period. Historians place these buckrider-hunts alongside other prosecuted 'godless' people: heretics and witches. These kinds of ruthless and fullscale trials last took place in Limburg.

Most of the crimes they were accused of, buckrider gangmembers never performed (such as the pact with the devil). There never was an organized central buckriders gang, but small separate groups.

Small was also the Koret Distinguished Scholar, Hoover Institution, Stanford University. He was the Director/Associate Professor of [[Urban Studies]] at [[Southern Connecticut State University]]. Small has been a visiting professor at University College London; McGill University, Montreal; the University of Vilnius, Lithuania, and Cape Town University, South Africa. He also spoke as an expert on anti-Semitism at the Australian, British, Canadian, Chilean and Italian Parliaments, the German Bundestag, and at the United Nations, Geneva and in New York.

On September 19, 2006, Yale University founded The Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism [http://www.yale.edu/isps/seminars/antisemitism/index.html], the first North American university-based center for study of the subject, housed at the Institute for Social and Policy Studies, with Small as director and founder. He cited the increase in anti-Semitism worldwide in recent years as generating a "need to understand the current manifestation of this disease".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/19/america/NA_GEN_US_Yale_Anti_Semitism.php Yale creates center to study anti-Semitism] Associated Press, September 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;''

In August 2010 in New Haven, Small was elected as the President of the newly formed International Association for the Study of Antisemitism (IASA).

Small was one of a number of academics who submitted evidence to the British All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism. He was also an expert for the Canadian All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism. Charles Asher Small convened an historical conference at the Vatican in September 2017.  The ISGAP-Vatican Conference entitled "Antisemitism and Minority Rights in the Middle East: Regional and International Implications".   The international conference brought together scholars from around the world - Christian, Muslim, Copts, Bahai, Jewish, Catholic thinkers, as well as humans rights activists and policy makers including the British former Prime Minister Tony Blair.

==Study of Antisemitism==
Charles Asher Small and his colleagues at ISGAP have been at the forefront of ensuring that the scholars deal with issues of contemporary antisemitism at the academic level, around the world.

== Contributions ==
In a path-breaking article entitled "Anti-Israel Sentiment Predicts Anti-Semitism in Europe,"[http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/50/4/548.short] in The Journal of Conflict Resolution, Small and Yale's Prof. [[Edward Kaplan]] demonstrated that Europeans who hold deeply anti-Israeli views are  more likely to also have classic anti-Semitic opinions by a significant margin.  Looking at populations in 10 European countries, Small and Kaplan surveyed 5,000 respondents, asking them about Israeli actions and classical anti-Semitic stereotypes. "There were questions about whether the IDF purposely targets children, whether Israel poisons the Palestinians' water supply - these sorts of extreme mythologies," Small says.  They demonstrated that Europeans whose opinions are extremely anti-Israel, are highly likely to also be anti-Semitic. "The people who believed the anti-Israel mythologies also tended to believe that Jews are not honest in business, have dual loyalties, control government and the economy, and the like," Small says. The study demonstrated that an Israel-hating European is 56% more likely to be anti-Semitic than the average European.  "This is extraordinary. It's off the charts," says Small. "If a food or a drug was 56% more likely to cause cancer, it would be taken off the shelf."&lt;ref&gt;Yale expert: Not enough known about anti-Semitism, Aug. 8, 2007, Haviv Rettig Gur , ''The Jerusalem Post'' [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1186557401345&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mosaic covenant]] or [[Law of Moses]]{{snd}} which [[Christians]] generally call the [[Mosaic covenant#Christianity|"Old Covenant"]] (in contrast to the [[New Covenant]]){{snd}} has played an important role in the [[origins of Christianity]] and has occasioned serious dispute and controversy since the beginnings of Christianity: note for example [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]]' [[Matthew 5#Antitheses|teaching of the Law]] during his [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[circumcision controversy in early Christianity]].

[[Rabbinic Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&amp;letter=G#543 Jewish Encyclopedia: Gentiles: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah]&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that Moses presented the [[Halakha|Jewish religious laws]] to the [[Jewish people]] and that those laws do not apply to [[Gentiles]] (including Christians), with the exception of the [[Seven Laws of Noah]], which (it teaches) apply to all people.

Most Christians believe that [[Supersessionism|only parts dealing with the moral law (as opposed to ceremonial law) are still applicable]], others believe that [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|none apply]], [[Dual-covenant theology|dual-covenant theologians]] believe that the Old Covenant remains valid only for Jews, and a minority have the view that [[Jewish Christianity|all parts still apply]] to believers in Jesus and in the New Covenant.

{{See also|Catechism of the Catholic Church|Catholic doctrine regarding the Ten Commandments|Hebrew Catholics}}

Theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] explained that there are three types of biblical precepts: moral, ceremonial, and judicial. He holds that moral precepts are permanent, having held even before the Law was given, since they are part of the [[Natural law|law of nature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2100.htm Summa Theologica, I-II, q. 100]&lt;/ref&gt; Ceremonial precepts (the "ceremonial law", dealing with forms of worshipping God and with [[Tumah and taharah|ritual cleanness]]) and judicial precepts (such as those in Exodus 21&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) came into existence only with the [[Law of Moses]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2100.htm Summa Theologica, I-II, q. 103, a. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; and were only temporary. The ceremonial commands were "ordained to the Divine worship ''for that particular time'' and to the foreshadowing of [[Christ]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2102.htm#2 Summa Theologica, I-II, q. 102, a. 2] (emphasis added)&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, upon the coming of Christ they ceased to bind,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2103.htm#3 Summa Theologica, I-II, q. 103, a. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; and to observe them now would, Aquinas thought, be equivalent to declaring falsely that Christ has not yet come, for Christians a [[mortal sin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2103.htm#4 Summa Theologica, I-II, q. 103, a. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while the judicial laws ceased to bind with the advent of Christ, it was not a mortal sin to enforce them. Aquinas says, "if a sovereign were to order these judicial precepts to be observed in his kingdom, he would not sin."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2104.htm Summa Theologica, I-II, q. 104, a. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Aquinas believed the specifics of the Old Testament judicial laws were no longer binding, he taught that the judicial precepts contained universal principles of justice that reflected natural law. Thus some scholars refer to his views on government as "General Equity Theonomy."&lt;ref&gt;See Clausen, Mark A. "Theonomy in the Middle Ages." Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Marriott Wardman Park, Omni Shoreham, Washington Hilton, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the ceremonial and judicial precepts, moral commands continue to bind, and are summed up in the [[Ten Commandments]] (though the assigning of the weekly holiday to Saturday is ceremonial). The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states:
:"2068 The [[Council of Trent]] teaches that the Ten Commandments are obligatory for Christians and that the justified man is still bound to keep them; the Second Vatican Council confirms: 'The bishops, successors of the apostles, receive from the Lord ... the mission of teaching all peoples, and of preaching the Gospel to every creature, so that all men may attain salvation through faith, Baptism and the observance of the Commandments.'"
:2070. The Ten Commandments belong to God's revelation. At the same time they teach us the true humanity of man. They bring to light the essential duties, and therefore, indirectly, the fundamental rights inherent in the nature of the human person. The Decalogue contains a privileged expression of the natural law: "From the beginning, God had implanted in the heart of man the precepts of the natural law. Then he was content to remind him of them. This was the Decalogue" ([[Irenaeus|St. Irenaeus]], ''Adv. haeres.'' 4, 15, 1: PG 7/1, 1012).
:2072. Since they express man's fundamental duties towards God and towards his neighbour, the Ten Commandments reveal, in their primordial content, grave obligations. They are fundamentally immutable, and they oblige always and everywhere. No one can dispense from them. The Ten Commandments are engraved by God in the human heart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2.htm ''Part 3, Life in Christ: Section 2, The Ten Commandments: "Teacher, what must I do ...?"'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_05071998_dies-domini_en.html Apostolic Letter ''Dies Domini'', 1;] [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/romancat.html The Catechism of the Council of Trent:] ''The Jewish Sabbath Changed To Sunday By The Apostles''&lt;/ref&gt; instituted the religious celebration of Sunday without transferring to it the ceremonial obligations associated with the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]],&lt;ref&gt;The choice of the last day of the week (Saturday) and the rules about the precise manner of keeping that day holy are seen as ceremonial precepts like those about abstention from eating pork or from having sex with a woman during her periods.&lt;/ref&gt; although later some of these obligations became attached to Sunday, not without opposition within the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14335a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: ''Sunday'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic Church thus applies to Sunday, the [[Lord's Day]], the Third Commandment.&lt;ref&gt;The Roman Catholic and Lutheran numbering of the [[Ten Commandments]], which are often abbreviated for [[catechetical]] purposes (see [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/command.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church: ''The Ten Commandments'']), differs from that followed by other Protestants.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lutheran===
{{See also|Law and Gospel|Adiaphora}}

[[File:Cranach Gesetz und Gnade Gotha.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Law and Gospel (Cranach)|Law and Grace]]'' (c. 1529), by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], a Lutheran. The left side of the tree illustrates ''law'', while the right side illustrates ''grace''.]]

Article V of the [[Formula of Concord]] (1577) of the [[Lutheran Church]] declares:&lt;ref name="BOC2"&gt;''Triglot Concordia'', FC Epitome V, (II).1, p. 503ff&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|We believe, teach, and confess that the distinction between the Law and the Gospel is to be maintained in the Church with great diligence as an especially brilliant light, by which, according to the admonition of St. Paul, the Word of God is rightly divided.}}

The distinction between [[Law and Gospel]] is that [[Torah|Law]] demands obedience to God's will, while [[Gospel]] refers to the promise of forgiveness of sins in the light of the person and work of [[Jesus Christ]]. Between 1580 and 1713 (considered the age of [[Lutheran Orthodoxy]]) this principle was considered of fundamental importance by Lutheran theologians.

The foundation of evangelical [[Lutheran]] biblical exegesis and exposition is contained in the [[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] (Article 4) (1531):

:All Scripture ought to be distributed into these two principal topics, the Law and the promises. For in some places it presents the Law, and in others the promise concerning Christ, namely, either when [in the [[Old Testament]]] it promises that Christ will come, and offers, for His sake, the remission of sins justification, and life eternal, or when, in the Gospel [in the [[New Testament]]], Christ Himself, since He has appeared, promises the remission of sins, justification, and life eternal.&lt;ref name="BOC1"&gt;F. Bente and W.H.T. Dau, ed. and trans. &lt;cite&gt;Triglot Concordia: The Symbolical Books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church&lt;/cite&gt;, (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1921), Apology IV (II).5, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutherans, quoting [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians2&amp;version=NIV Colossians 2] and [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans14&amp;version=NIV Romans 14], believe that [[circumcision]] and the other Old Testament ceremonial laws no longer apply to Christians.&lt;ref name=WELS&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=810&amp;cuItem_itemID=990 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090928185204/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=810&amp;cuItem_itemID=990 |archivedate=28 September 2009 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title= Genesis 17:6ff - Everlasting |publisher=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod |accessdate=5 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformed===
[[File:Décalogue de l'église de Gléresse.JPG|thumb|The decalog of the reformed church of Ligerz, Switzerland]]
The view of the [[Reformed churches]] or [[Calvinism]], referred to as [[Covenant Theology]], is similar to the Roman Catholic view in holding that Mosaic Law continues under the [[New Covenant]], while declaring that parts of it have "expired" and are no longer applicable.&lt;ref name="Bahnsen, 1993"&gt;Bahnsen, et al., ''Five Views on Law and Gospel''. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] (1646) divides the Mosaic laws into three categories: moral, civil, and ceremonial.&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Ross, [http://www.christianfocus.com/item/show/1364/- From the Finger of God: The Biblical and Theological Grounds for the Threefold Division of the Law]. (Fearn: Mentor, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of the [[Westminster Divines]], only the moral laws of the Mosaic Law, which include the Ten Commandments and the commands repeated in the New Testament, directly apply to Christians today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/index.html?body=/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_XIX.html WCF: Chapter XIX]&lt;/ref&gt; Ceremonial laws, in this view, include the regulations pertaining to ceremonial cleanliness, festivals, diet, and the [[Levite|Levitical priesthood]].

Advocates of this view hold that, while not always easy to do and overlap between categories does occur, the divisions they make are possible and supported based on information contained in the commands themselves; specifically to whom they are addressed, whom or what they speak about, and their content. For example, a ceremonial law might be addressed to the Levites, speak of purification or holiness and have content that could be considered as a foreshadowing of some aspect of Christ's life or ministry. In keeping with this, most advocates also hold that when the Law is spoken of as everlasting, it is in reference to certain divisions of the Law.

===Anglican and Methodist===
[[Anglican]] and [[Methodist]] theology regarding the Old Covenant is expressed by their historic defining statements known as the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] and [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]], respectively.&lt;ref name="GreenmanLarsen2012"/&gt;

[[s:Thirty-Nine Articles#VII. Of the Old Testament.|Article 7]] of the [[Church of England]]'s 1563 version and other versions, as well as Article VI of the Methodist Articles of Religion, specify only that Christians are bound by the "commandments which are called moral," but not bound by the ceremonial, ritual, or civil laws from the [[Five Books of Moses|"law of Moses."]]&lt;ref name="GreenmanLarsen2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenman|first1=Jeffrey P.|last2=Larsen|first2=Timothy|title=The Decalogue Through the Centuries: From the Hebrew Scriptures to Benedict XVI|year=2012|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|language=English|isbn=9780664234904|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dispensationalism===
As a theological system, [[Dispensationalism]] is rooted in the writings of [[John Nelson Darby]] (1800–1882) and the [[Brethren Movement]], but it has never been formally defined and incorporates several variants. Dispensationists divide the Bible into varying numbers of separate [[Dispensation (period)|dispensations or ages]]. Traditional dispensationalists believe only the New Testament applies to the church of today whereas [[Hyperdispensationalism|hyperdispensationalists]] believe only the second half of the New Testament, starting either in the middle of Acts or at Acts 28, applies.

Wayne G. Strickland, professor of theology at the [[Multnomah University]], claims that his (not necessarily "the") Dispensationalist view is that "the age of the church has rendered the law inoperative".&lt;ref&gt;''Five Views on Law and Gospel'', Gundry editor, Chapter 4: ''The Inauguration of the Law of Christ with the Gospel of Christ: A Dispensational View'' by Wayne G. Strickland, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1993, page 259&lt;/ref&gt;

This view holds that Mosaic Laws and the penalties attached to them were limited to the particular historical and theological setting of the [[Old Testament]]. In that view, the Law was given to [[Israelites|Israel]] and does not apply since the age of the [[New Covenant]].

Replacing the Mosaic Law is the [[The Law of Christ|“Law of Christ”]], which however holds definite similarities with the Mosaic Law in moral concerns, but is new and different, replacing the original Law. Despite this difference, Dispensationalists continue to seek to find moral and religious principles applicable for today in Mosaic Law.

Believing the New Covenant to be a new dispensation, George R. Law has proposed that the Law of Christ is recorded in Matthew 5-7. He suggests that Matthew’s record of the Sermon on the Mount is structured similar to the literary form of an ancient Near Eastern covenant treaty. Law’s theory is built on the work of Viktor Korošec, Donald J. Wiseman, and George E. Mendenhall. This new covenant form, like other variations of the covenant form throughout ancient history, can be identified by its combination of ancient covenant elements. If this record in Matthew can be identified as the record of the promised New Covenant, then its contents can also be identified as the formal presentation of the Law of Christ (and includes Christ’s new Ten Commandments).&lt;ref&gt;George R. Law, “The Form of the New Covenant in Matthew,” ''American Theological Inquiry'' 5:2 (2012). For more information on the content of the Law of Christ including His Ten Commandments see George R. Law, ''The Law of Christ: God’s Will for New Testament Believers'' (Pfafftown, NC: Ready Scribe Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

One view of Dispensationalism divides the Bible into these seven periods:
#of innocence (Gen 1:1–3:7), prior to Adam's fall;
#of conscience (Gen 3:8–8:22), Adam to Noah;
#of government (Gen 9:1–11:32), Noah to Abraham;
#of patriarchal rule (Gen 12:1–Exod 19:25), Abraham to Moses;
#of the Mosaic Law (Exod 20:1–Acts 2:4), Moses to Jesus;
#of grace (Acts 2:4–Rev 20:3), the current church age; and
#of a literal, earthly 1,000-year Millennial Kingdom that has yet to come (Rev 20:4–20:6).&lt;ref&gt;[[Scofield Reference Bible]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A misunderstanding of Dispensationalism sees{{citation needed|reason=Trying to hide opinion/apology behind passive phrases and "a natural"|date=December 2011}} the covenant of Sinai (dispensation #5) to have been replaced by the [[gospel]] (dispensation #6). However, Dispensationalists believe that ethnic Israel, distinct from the church, and on the basis of the Sinai covenant, are featured in New Testament promises, which they interpret as referring to a future time associated with the [[Millennialism|Millennium of Revelation 20]] (dispensation #7). In Dispensational thought, although the time from [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus' resurrection]] until [[Second Coming|his return]] (or the advent of the Millennium) is dominated by the proclamation of the gospel, the Sinai covenant is neither terminated nor replaced, rather it is "quiescent" awaiting a fulfillment at the Millennium. This time of Jewish restoration has an especially prominent place within Dispensationalism, see also [[Christian Zionism]]{{citation needed|reason=This whole paragrpah has been unsourced since 2011|date=November 2016}}.

===Theonomy===
Starting in the 1970s and 1980s, an obscure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Religiously Motivated Violence in the Abortion Debate|title=Oxford Handbook of Religion and Violence|pages=316&amp;ndash;317|last=Ingersoll|first=Judie|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor1-first=Mark |editor1-last=Juergensmeyer |editor2-first=Margo |editor2-last=Kitts |editor3-first=Michael |editor3-last=Jerryson|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; branch of Calvinism known as [[Christian Reconstructionism]] argued that the civil laws as well as the moral laws should be applied in today's society (a position called [[Theonomy]]) as part of establishing a modern theonomic state.&lt;ref name="Bahnsen, 1993"/&gt; This view is a break from the [[#Calvinist|traditional Reformed position]], including that of [[John Calvin]] and the [[Puritan]]s, which holds that the civil laws have been abrogated though they remain useful as guidance and revelation of God's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Moses' Law for Modern Government|last=Duncan|first=J. Ligon III|url=http://www.reformed.org/ethics/index.html?mainframe=/ethics/ligon_duncan_critique.html|date=October 15, 1994|conference=Annual national meeting of the Social Science History Association|location=Atlanta, GA|author-link=Ligon Duncan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130075203/http://www.reformed.org/ethics/index.html?mainframe=%2Fethics%2Fligon_duncan_critique.html|archivedate=30 November 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=23 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theonomists go further and embrace the idea that the whole Law continues to function, contending that the way in which Christians observe some commands has changed but not the content or meaning of the commands. For example, they would say that the ceremonial commands regarding [[Passover (Christian holiday)|Passover]] were looking forward to [[Atonement in Christianity|Christ's sacrificial death]] and the [[Eucharist|Communion]] mandate is looking back on it, the former is given to the [[Kohen|Levitical priesthood]] and the latter is given to the [[priesthood of all believers]], but both have the same content and meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Rousas John Rushdoony, ''[[The Institutes of Biblical Law]]''. (Nutley, NJ: Presbyterian &amp; Reformed Pub. Co., 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greg L. Bahnsen, ''Theonomy in Christian Ethics''. (Nacogdoches, TX: Covenant Media Press, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary North, Gary DeMar, ''Christian Reconstruction: What It Is, What It Isn't.'' (Tyler, TX: Institute for Christian Economics, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greg L. Bahnsen, ''No Other Standard: Theonomy and Its Critics''. (Tyler, TX: Institute for Christian Economics, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Covenant Theology===
[[New Covenant Theology]] (or NCT), is a recently expressed [[Christian theological]] system on this issue that incorporates aspects of [[Dispensationalism]] and [[Covenant Theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj18f.pdf TMSJ 18/1 (Fall 2007) 149-163: ''Introduction to New Covenant Theology'']&lt;/ref&gt;

NCT claims that all Old Covenant laws have been fulfilled by Christ and are thus cancelled or abrogated&lt;ref&gt;''ALL Old Testament Laws Cancelled: 24 Reasons Why All Old Testament Laws Are Cancelled and All New Testament Laws Are for Our Obedience'', Greg Gibson, 2008, page 7: "New Covenant Theology (the view in this book) is a rapidly-spreading view with a better priest, better sacrifice, and better covenant (containing a better law)."&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of the [[Law of Christ]] or New Covenant law. This can be summarized as the ethical expectation found in the New Testament. Thus NCT rejects [[antinomianism]] as they do not reject religious law, only the Old Covenant law. NCT is in contrast with other views on Biblical law in that most other [[Christian churches]] do not believe the [[Ten Commandments#Christianity|Ten Commandments]] and other Divine laws of the Old Covenant have been "cancelled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Colossians|2:14|NIV}} is the origin of the term "cancelled" in New Covenant Theology.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Covenant theologians see the Law of Christ or New Testament Law as actually including many of the Divine Laws, thus, even though all Old Covenant laws have been cancelled, many have still been renewed under the Law of Christ. This is a conclusion similar to older Christian theological systems on this issue, that some Old Covenant laws are still valid, but this understanding is reached in a different way. On the issue of the law, Dispensationalism is most similar to NCT, but New Covenant Theology may be still evolving a coherent system that will better distinguish itself from it. Richard Barcellos has criticized NCT for proposing that the Ten Commandments have been cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;''In Defense of the Decalogue : A Critique of New Covenant Theology'', Richard Barcellos, Founder's Press, 2001. Barcellos is an associate professor of New Testament Studies at the Midwest Center for Theological Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dual-covenant theology===
Since the Nazi Holocaust, this question of whether Christianity requires a "triumphalist" attitude towards Jews has become "very difficult" for Christians.&lt;ref name=malcom&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0003-3286| volume = 79| issue = 4| pages = 627| last = Malcolm| first = Lois| title = The God of Israel and Christian Theology| journal = Anglican Theological Review| accessdate = 2017-05-29| date = 1997-10-01| url = https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-26504408/the-god-of-israel-and-christian-theology}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the Church's traditions have held the "[[supersessionist]]" view that under the [[New Covenant]] the Christian people were the new "spiritual" Israel,  further, that "the old 'carnal' Israel had been "superseded".&lt;ref name=malcom/&gt;

Many Christians now reject the supersessionist view.&lt;ref name=malcom/&gt; In direct contrast with [[Supersessionism]] (and also the doctrines of [[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus]] and [[Solus Christus]]) is [[Dual-covenant theology]]. This is a [[Liberal Christian]] view that holds that God's [[Covenant (biblical)|biblical covenant]] with the Jewish people is "everlasting."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref||Genesis|17:13|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{cn|date=May 2017|reason=citation for which denominations believe in dual covenant theology}}

==Law-related passages with disputed interpretation==
{{See also|unclean animals|taboo food and drink}}
The Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament describes a conflict among the first Christians as to the necessity of following all the laws of the Torah to the letter, see also [[Council of Jerusalem]] and [[Incident at Antioch]].

Some have interpreted the [[NRSV]]'s parenthetical statement: "(Thus he declared all foods clean.)"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|7:19|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mean that Jesus taught that the [[Kashrut|pentateuchal food laws]] were no longer applicable to his followers, see also [[Antinomianism#Antinomianism in the New Testament|Antinomianism in the New Testament]].  The parenthetical statement is not found in the NRSV's Matthean parallel Matthew 15:15–20&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|15:15–20|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a disputed translation, for example, the ''Scholars Version''&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Robert J. Editor ''The Complete Gospels'' Polebridge Press 1994 {{ISBN|0-06-065587-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; has: "This is how everything we eat is purified"; Gaus' ''[[Unvarnished New Testament]]''&lt;ref&gt;Gaus, Andy. ''The Unvarnished New Testament'' 1991 {{ISBN|0-933999-99-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; has: "purging all that is eaten." See also Strong's G2511.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/words.pl?word=2511 Strong's G2511]&lt;/ref&gt;

The disputed word is καθαρός meaning "purity". [[Gerhard Kittel]] writes "It is of the essence of NT religion that the older, ritual concept of purity is not merely transcended, but rejected as non-obligatory. Religious and moral purity replaced ritual and cultic."&lt;ref name=kittel&gt;{{cite book |last=Kittel|first=Gerhard |title=Theological Dictionary of the New Testament |publisher=Eerdmans Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus develops his doctrine of purity in his struggle against [[Pharisees|Pharisaism]]&lt;ref name=nid&gt;{{cite book |last=Verbrugge |first=Veryln |title=New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology |publisher=Zondervan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in {{bibleverse||Matthew|23:25–26|ESV}} he rejects observance of ritual purity regulations because this kind of purity is merely external. What defiles a person comes from within, from the human heart {{bibleverse||Mark|7:20-23|ESV}}&lt;ref name=nid/&gt;

Others note that Peter had never eaten anything that was not [[kosher]] many years after Acts 2 ([[Pentecost]]). To the heavenly vision he announced: "Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|10:14|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Peter was unaware that Jesus had changed the Mosaic food laws, implying that Jesus did not change these rules. Later in Acts, it should be noted that Peter realizes the vision is in reference to the gentiles now cleaned through Christ. In [[Mark 7]], Jesus may have been just referring to a tradition of the [[Pharisees]] about eating with [[Hand washing|unwashed hands]].  The expression "purging all meats" may have meant the digestion and elimination of food from the body rather than the declaration that all foods were kosher. The confusion primarily centers around the participle used in the original Greek for "purging". Some scholars{{who|date= November 2018}} believe it agrees with the word for Jesus, which is nearly 40 words away from the participle. If this is the case, then it would mean that Jesus himself is the one doing the purifying. In New Testament Greek, however, the participle is rarely that far away from the noun it modifies, and many scholars agree that it is far more likely that the participle is modifying the digestive process (literally: the latrine), which is only two words away.{{citation needed|date= November 2018}}

Still others{{who|date= November 2018}} believe a partial list of the commandments was merely an abbreviation that stood for all the commandments because Jesus prefaced his statement to the rich young ruler with the statement: "If you want to enter life, obey the commandments". Some people{{who|date= November 2018}} claim that since Jesus did not qualify his pronouncement, that he meant all the commandments. The rich young ruler asked "which" commandments. Jesus gave him a partial list. The first set of commandments deal with a relationship to God (''[[Hebrew]]: בין האדם למקום bein ha'adam lamakom''). The second set of commandments deal with a relationship to men (''[[Hebrew]]: בין האדם לאדם bein ha'adam la'adam''). No doubt Jesus considered the relationship to God important, but Jesus may have considered that the young man was perhaps lacking in this second set, which made him obligated to men. (This is implied by his statement that to be perfect he should sell his goods, give them to the poor and come and follow Jesus — thereby opening to him a place in the coming Kingdom.){{citation needed|date= November 2018}}

Several times Paul mentioned adhering to "the Law"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Romans|2:12–16}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|3:31}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|7:12}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|8:7–8}},{{bibleverse||Gal|5:3}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|24:14}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|25:8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and preached about Ten Commandment topics such as "[[idolatry]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Cor|5:11}}, {{bibleverse|1|Cor|6:9–10}}, {{bibleverse|1|Cor|10:7}}, {{bibleverse|1|Cor|10:14}}, {{bibleverse||Gal|5:19–21}}, {{bibleverse||Eph|5:5}}, {{bibleverse||Col|3:5}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|17:16–21}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|19:23–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Law of Christ]]. Many Christians believe that the [[Sermon on the Mount]] is a form of commentary on the Ten Commandments. In the [[Expounding of the Law]], Jesus said that he did not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it (e.g. Mathew 5:17–18 "Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. 18 For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled); while in [[Marcion]]'s version of Luke 23:2 we find the extension: "We found this fellow perverting the nation ''and destroying the law and the prophets''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-03/anf03-32.htm#P7077_2049929 Ante-Nicene Fathers: Tertullian: Against Marcion: Dr. Holmes' Note]: "In [Luke 23:2], after the words "perverting the nation," Marcion added, "and destroying the law and the prophets; [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3827/Gospel6.html%23Pilate&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:05:37 Gospel of Marcion: Jesus Before Pilate and Herod]&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Expounding of the Law#Adherence to the Law|Adherence to the Law]] and [[Expounding of the Law#Antithesis of the Law|Antithesis of the Law]].

==History and background==

===Hellenism===
[[Image:MacedonEmpire.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Map of Alexander's empire, {{circa|334–323&amp;nbsp;BC}}]]
{{See also|Hellenization|Cultural and historical background of Jesus}}

The conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in the late 4th century BC spread [[Hellenistic civilization|Greek culture]] and [[colonization]] over non-Greek lands, including [[Judea]] and [[Galilee]], and gave rise to the [[Hellenistic age]], which sought to create a common or [[Cultural universal|universal culture]] in the Alexandrian or [[Macedonian Empire]] based on that of 5th and 4th century BC [[Athens]] (see also [[Age of Pericles]]), along with a fusion of [[Near East]]ern cultures.&lt;ref name=mcleod&gt;Roy M. MacLeod, ''The Library Of Alexandria: Centre Of Learning In The Ancient World''&lt;/ref&gt;

This synthesised [[Hellenistic culture]] had a profound impact on the customs and practices of Jews, both in the [[Land of Israel]] and in the [[Jewish Diaspora|Diaspora]]. There was a cultural standoff between the Jewish and Greek cultures. The inroads into Judaism gave rise to [[Hellenistic Judaism]] in the [[Jewish diaspora]] which attempted to establish the [[Judaism|Hebraic-Jewish religious tradition]] within the culture and language of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]]. The major literary product of the movement was the [[Septuagint]] and major authors were [[Philo of Alexandria]] and [[Josephus]]. Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=283&amp;letter=S&amp;search=Paul%20of%20Tarsus#964 Jewish Encyclopedia: Saul of Tarsus: Not a Hebrew Scholar; a Hellenist]&lt;/ref&gt; consider [[Paul of Tarsus]] a ''Hellenist'' as well, see also [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism]].

There was a general deterioration in relations between hellenized Jews and religious Jews, leading the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] to ban certain [[Judaism|Jewish religious rites and traditions]], his aim being to turn [[Jerusalem in Judaism|Jerusalem]] into a Greek [[polis]], to be named ''Antiochia''.&lt;ref&gt;H.H Ben-Sasson, ''A History of the Jewish People'', Harvard University Press, 1969, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2kSovzudhFUC&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=isbn%3A0674397312&amp;pg=PA203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 203], {{ISBN|0-674-39731-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, he decreed the death penalty for anyone who observed the [[Shabbat|sabbath]] or [[Brit milah|practiced circumcision]], rededicated the [[Second Temple|Jewish Temple]] to [[Zeus]], and forced Jews to [[Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork|eat pork]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Sasson, 1969, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2kSovzudhFUC&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=isbn%3A0674397312&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 204]&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the orthodox Jews revolted against the Greek ruler leading to the formation of an independent Jewish kingdom, known as the [[Hasmonaean Dynasty]], which lasted from 165&amp;nbsp;BCE to 63&amp;nbsp;BCE. The Hasmonean Dynasty eventually disintegrated in a civil war. The people, who did not want to continue to be governed by a corrupt and hellenized dynasty, appealed to Rome for intervention, leading to a total Roman conquest and annexation of the country, see [[Iudaea province]].

Nevertheless, the cultural issues remained unresolved. The main issue separating the Hellenistic and orthodox Jews was the application of biblical laws in a Hellenistic ([[melting pot]]) culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=567&amp;letter=H&amp;search=Hellenistic%20Judaism Jewish Encyclopedia: Hellenism]: "Post-exilic Judaism was largely recruited from those returned exiles who regarded it as their chief task to preserve their religion uncontaminated, a task that required the strict separation of the congregation both from all foreign peoples (Ezra x. 11; Neh. ix. 2) and from the Jewish inhabitants of Palestine who did not strictly observe the Law (Ezra vi. 22; Neh. x. 29)."&lt;/ref&gt;  One issue was [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcision]], which was repulsive to a Greek mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=514&amp;letter=C&amp;search=circumcision#2 Jewish Encyclopedia: Circumcision: In Apocryphal and Rabbinical Literature]: "Contact with Grecian life, especially at the games of the arena [which involved nudity], made this distinction obnoxious to the Hellenists, or antinationalists; and the consequence was their attempt to appear like the Greeks by [[epispasm]] ("making themselves foreskins"; I Macc. i. 15; Josephus, "Ant." xii. 5, § 1; Assumptio Mosis, viii.; I Cor. vii. 18; , Tosef., Shab. xv. 9; Yeb. 72a, b; Yer. Peah i. 16b; Yeb. viii. 9a). All the more did the law-observing Jews defy the edict of [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] prohibiting circumcision (I Macc. i. 48, 60; ii. 46); and the Jewish women showed their loyalty to the Law, even at the risk of their lives, by themselves circumcising their sons.";  {{cite journal| last = Hodges| first = Frederick, M.| year = 2001| title = The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme| journal = The Bulletin of the History of Medicine| volume = 75| issue = Fall 2001| pages = 375–405| url = http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/| format = PDF| accessdate = 2007-07-24| doi = 10.1353/bhm.2001.0119| pmid=11568485}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some theorize that the [[early Christian]]s came largely from the group of hellenized Jews who were less attached to Jewish rituals, philosophies and practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=283&amp;letter=S&amp;search=Paul%20of%20Tarsus#968 Jewish Encyclopedia: Saul of Tarsus: Jewish Proselytism and Paul]: "As a matter of fact, only the Jewish propaganda work along the Mediterranean Sea made it possible for Paul and his associates to establish Christianity among the Gentiles, as is expressly recorded in the Acts ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|10:2}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:16}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:26}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:43}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:50}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|16:14}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|17:4}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|17:17}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:7}}); and it is exactly from such synagogue manuals for [[proselytes]] as the [[Didache]] and the [[Didascalia]] that the ethical teachings in the Epistles of Paul and of Peter were derived (see Seeberg, "Der Katechismus der Urchristenheit," 1903, pp. 1–44)."&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Anti-Judaism]].

===Paul the Apostle and Biblical law===
{{Main article|Paul the Apostle and Judaism}}
{{Also|Christianity in the 1st century}}

Some scholars{{who|date= November 2018}} see [[Paul the Apostle]] (or Saul) as completely in line with 1st-century Judaism (a "[[Pharisee]]" and student of [[Gamaliel]]), others see him as opposed to 1st-century Judaism (see [[Antinomianism#Pauline passages supporting antinomianism|Pauline passages supporting antinomianism]] and [[Marcionism]]), while still others{{who|date= November 2018}} see him as somewhere in between these two extremes, opposed to "Ritual Laws" such as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]] but in full agreement on "[[Divine Law]]".

===Council of Jerusalem===
[[Image:Saint James the Just.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Icon of [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]], whose judgment was adopted in the [[Apostolic Decree]] of {{bibleverse||Acts|15:19-29}}, c. 50 AD.]]

{{Main article|Council of Jerusalem}}
{{See also|Circumcision controversy in early Christianity}}

The ''Council of Jerusalem''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|15|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; of about 50 AD was the first meeting in [[early Christianity]] called upon to consider the application of Mosaic Law to the new community. Specifically, it had to consider whether new Gentile [[religious conversion|convert]]s to Christianity were obligated to undergo [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcision]] for full membership in the Christian community, but it was conscious that the issue had wider implications, since circumcision is the "everlasting" sign of the [[Abrahamic covenant|Abrahamic Covenant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|17:9-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern differences over the interpretation of this come from the understanding of the use of the word "Law" in Paul's writings (example: Gal 3:10) as referring only to Mosaic Law (Torah) but in 1st century Hebrew understanding had multiple meanings which also included Jewish and Roman civil laws.

At the time, the Christian community would have considered itself a part of the wider Jewish community, with most of the leaders of the Church being Jewish or Jewish [[proselytes]].

The decision of the Council came to be called the ''Apostolic Decree''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|15:19-21|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was that most ''Mosaic law'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Jewish law]] or ''Halakha'' was formalized later, see [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=254&amp;letter=J&amp;search=Jesus#1000 Jewish Encyclopedia: Jesus of Nazareth: Attitude Toward the Law]: "Jesus, however, does not appear to have taken into account the fact that the Halakah was at this period just becoming crystallized, and that much variation existed as to its definite form; the disputes of the [[Hillel and Shammai|Bet Hillel and Bet Shammai]] were occurring about the time of his maturity."&lt;/ref&gt; including the requirement for circumcision of males, was not obligatory for [[Gentile]] converts, possibly in order to make it easier for them to join the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|15:19|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Council did retain the prohibitions against eating meat containing [[Taboo food and drink#Blood|"blood"]], or meat of animals not properly slain, and against [[Porneia|"fornication"]] and [[Idolatry and Christianity|"idol worship"]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Josef von Hefele]]'s [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html Commentary on canon II of Gangra] notes: "We further see that, at the time of the Synod of Gangra, the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the [[Greek Orthodox|Greeks]], indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. [[Theodore Balsamon|Balsamon]] also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic Canon]], expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] in his work Contra Faustum, where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, Pope Gregory the Third 731 forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Synods]], can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuser, like other laws."&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with [[Augustine of Hippo]],&lt;ref&gt;''Contra Faust'', 32.13&lt;/ref&gt; many have seen a connection to [[Noahide Law]], while some modern scholars&lt;ref&gt;For example: [[Joseph Fitzmyer]], ''The Acts of the Apostles (The Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries)'', Yale University Press (December 2, 1998), {{ISBN|0-300-13982-9}}, chapter V&lt;/ref&gt; reject the connection to ''Noahide Law''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|9|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead see Lev 17-18&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Lev|17-18|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the basis. See also [[Proselyte#Rules for proselytes in the Torah|Old Testament Law applicable to converts]] and [[Leviticus 18]].

Noted in Acts 15:19-21, James tells the Jewish believers to understand his reasoning for writing letters to Gentile believers when he says, "For Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath." Knowing the new converts would have to attend a synagogue in order to learn the history of Israel and the Church, James set the Gentile believers up with a beginning attitude of precaution towards those who would preach Moses' Law as a requirement for Gentile believers.

The Apostolic decree may be a major act of [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|differentiation of the Church from its Jewish roots]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&amp;letter=B&amp;search=Baptism Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism]: "According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), Baptism, next to circumcision and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a proselyte to Judaism (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab. Zarah 57a; Shab. 135a; Yer. Kid. iii. 14, 64d). Circumcision, however, was much more important, and, like baptism, was called a "seal" (Schlatter, "Die Kirche Jerusalems," 1898, p. 70). But as circumcision was discarded by Christianity, and the sacrifices had ceased, Baptism remained the sole condition for initiation into religious life. The next ceremony, adopted shortly after the others, was the imposition of hands, which, it is known, was the usage of the Jews at the ordination of a rabbi. Anointing with oil, which at first also accompanied the act of Baptism, and was analogous to the anointment of priests among the Jews, was not a necessary condition."&lt;/ref&gt; the first being the [[Rejection of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[McGrath, Alister E.]], ''Christianity: An Introduction'', Blackwell Publishing,(2006), {{ISBN|1-4051-0899-1}}, Page 174: "In effect, they [Jewish Christians] seemed to regard Christianity as an affirmation of every aspect of contemporary Judaism, with the addition of one extra belief &amp;mdash; that Jesus was the Messiah. Unless males were circumcised, they could not be saved ({{bibleverse||Acts|15:1}})."&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the outcome is not inconsistent with the Jewish view on the applicability of Mosaic Law to non-Jews, the Decree created a category of persons who were members of the Christian community (which still considered itself to be part of the Jewish community) who were not considered to be [[Conversion to Judaism|full converts]] by the wider Jewish community. In the wider Jewish community these partial converts were welcomed (a common term for them being [[God fearers]], similar to the modern movement of [[B'nei Noah]], see [[dual covenant theology]]), but they as Gentiles were excluded from the [[Herod's Temple|Temple proper]] and certain rituals.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This created problems especially when the Christian community had become dominated by former Gentiles with less understanding of the reasons for the dispute.{{citation needed|reason=problems? problems for who?|date=December 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&amp;letter=G&amp;search=gentiles#525 Jewish Encyclopedia: Gentile: Judaism not hostile to Gentiles]: "In judging the [[Halakha|halakic enactments]] one must keep in mind not merely the situation of the Jews—engaged in a bitter struggle for self-preservation and exposed to all sorts of treachery and suffering from persecution—but also the distinction between law and equity. The law can not and does not recognize the right of demented persons, minors, or aliens to hold property. Even modern statutes are based on this principle; e.g., in the state of Illinois, U. S. A., an alien can not inherit real estate. But what the law denies, equity confers. The Talmudic phrase "mi-pene darke shalom" ("on account of the ways of peace"; see below) is the equivalent of the modern "in equity.""&lt;/ref&gt;

Since, therefore, they have been deserted by the paternal love, and puffed up by Satan, being brought over to the doctrine of Simon Magus, they have apostatized in their opinions from Him who is God, and imagined that they have themselves discovered more than the apostles, by finding out another god; and [maintained] that the apostles preached the Gospel still somewhat under the influence of Jewish opinions, but that they themselves are purer [in doctrine], and more intelligent, than the apostles."&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''Old Testament'' and ''New Testament'' are traditionally ascribed to Tertullian, but some scholars&lt;ref&gt;''The Canon Debate'', editors L. M. McDonald &amp; J. A. Sanders (Hendrickson, 2002), Everett Ferguson in chapter 18 quotes Tertullian's ''De praescriptione haereticorum'' 30: "Since Marcion separated the New Testament from the Old, he is necessarily subsequent to that which he separated, inasmuch as it was only in his power to separate what was previously united. Having been united previous to its separation, the fact of its subsequent separation proves the subsequence also of the man who effected the separation." Note 61 of page 308 adds: "[Wolfram] Kinzig suggests that it was Marcion who usually called his Bible ''testamentum'' [Latin for testament]."&lt;/ref&gt; instead propose Marcion as the source while other scholars propose that [[Melito of Sardis]] coined the phrase ''Old Testament''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QkI_JNv3rIwC&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;dq=melito+%22old+testament%22+%22first+used%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9_tprGuiPx&amp;sig=sygOITuaZ7Dok0yZK2aBmqe7iOk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result A Dictionary of Jewish-Christian Relations page 316]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johannes Agricola===
In 1525, [[Johannes Agricola]] advanced the doctrine that the [[Antinomianism#First Antinomian controversy|Law was no longer needed]] by [[Regeneration (theology)|regenerate]] Christians.&lt;ref&gt;F. Bente, ''Historical Introductions to the Symbolical Books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church'', chapter XVII: The Antinomistic Controversy, (St. Louis, MO: CPH, 1921), 161-172, cf. p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; This position however was strongly rejected by [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and in the [[Formula of Concord]] as [[antinomianism]].

===Leo Tolstoy===
In 1894, [[Leo Tolstoy]] published ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'', in which he advanced the doctrine that Jesus' [[Sermon on the Mount]], including its [[Antithesis of the Law]], was the true message of Jesus. Although Tolstoy never actually used the term "[[Christian anarchism]]", reviews of his book appear to have coined the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Recent scholarship===
Recent scholars influential in the debate regarding the law include [[F. F. Bruce]], [[Rudolf Bultmann]], Heikki Räisänen, [[Klyne Snodgrass]], [[C. E. B. Cranfield]],{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and others, as well as some of those involved with the [[New Perspective on Paul|New Perspectives movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Krister Stendahl]] argued in ."The Apostle Paul and the Introspective Conscience of the West". ''Harvard Theological Review'' 56 (1963), pp. 199–215. Reprinted in ''Paul Among Jews and Gentiles'' (Philadelphia: Fortress), 1976, pp. 78–96., that since Augustine, Western commentators have misunderstood Paul, due to an overly active conscience.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 [[Zondervan]] published ''The Law, the Gospel, and the Modern Christian: Five Views'' (and apparently republished it as ''Five Views on Law and Gospel'') in which its authors presented and debated five modern Protestant views on the topic. [[Willem A. VanGemeren]] presented a non-theonomic [[Reformed]] view, [[Greg Bahnsen|Greg L. Bahnsen]] presented the [[theonomic]] Reformed view, [[Walter Kaiser Jr.|Walter C.

The '''Church of the Guanche People''' ({{lang-es|Iglesia del Pueblo Guanche}}) is a religious organisation, founded in 2001 in the city of [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna]], [[Tenerife]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Spain]]. It aims to perpetuate and spread the [[Traditional Berber religion|traditional religion]] of the ancient [[Guanches|Guanche]] people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/502395/La_Iglesia_del_Pueblo_Guanche_consideraciones_metodologicas La Iglesia del Pueblo Guanche.

In 2008, the Church had approximately 300 members.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Veronica (2008).

Minorías religiosas en Canarias. Editado por la Universidad de La Laguna]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded by a group of Canarian devotees of the goddess [[Chaxiraxi]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/502395/La_Iglesia_del_Pueblo_Guanche_consideraciones_metodologicas La Iglesia del Pueblo Guanche. Consideraciones metodológicas. Gobierno de Canarias.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of the Guanche People performed [[baptism]]s and weddings according to what they know of Guanche custom. On 2002, a wedding held in accordance with purported Guanche rites took place on the island of Tenerife—a practice not observed for several centuries since the Spanish domination of the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/502395/La_Iglesia_del_Pueblo_Guanche_consideraciones_metodologicas La Iglesia del Pueblo Guanche. Consideraciones metodológicas. Gobierno de Canarias.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of the Guanche People has its own [[liturgical calendar]], which officially begins with the first celebration of ''Achu n Magek'' in 2001. According to this system, this is the year I of the ''Guanche New Age''. 2018 would therefore be the year 18 on this calendar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observatorioreligion.es/upload/80/39/Pdfd_interactivo_Canarias.pdf Religiones entre continentes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7775">According to the [[Church of Scientology]], '''ethics''' may be defined as the actions an individual takes on himself to ensure his continued survival across the [[Scientology beliefs and practices#The Dynamics|dynamics]]. It is a personal thing. When one is ethical, it is something he does himself by his own choice.&lt;ref name="scientologyethics.org"&gt;[http://www.scientologyethics.org/scientology-ethics.htm Scientology: Bettering Life with Scientology Ethics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617232906/http://scientologyethics.org/scientology-ethics.htm |date=2006-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s teachings, [[Scientology]] ethics is predicated on the idea that there are degrees of ethical conduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientologyethics.org/page02.htm Scientology: Bettering Life with Scientology Ethics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617232336/http://scientologyethics.org/page02.htm |date=2006-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Good and evil==
The Church's official position declares that "the logic of Scientology ethics is inarguable and based upon two key concepts: good and evil", and goes on to state that "nothing is completely good, and to build anew often requires a degree of destruction" and "to appreciate what Scientology ethics is all about, it must be understood that good can be considered to be a constructive survival action".&lt;ref name="scientologyethics.org"/&gt;

==Statistics==
In order to make ethical decisions that affect others around them, Scientologists are expected to use statistical measurement to assess the "measurement of survival potential". The Church's official website on ethics explains that "with an understanding of how to compile, graph and compare statistics, the Scientologist is amply equipped to determine exactly what condition an activity is in, and thus exactly what steps he must take in order to better that condition." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientologyethics.org/page06.htm Scientology: Bettering Life with Scientology Ethics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616081621/http://scientologyethics.org/page06.htm |date=2006-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Benjamin |first1=Eilliot P.H.D. |title=MODERN RELIGIONS: AN EXPERIENTIAL ANALYSIS AND EXPOSÉ |isbn=9781257082612 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard stated that all Scientology organizations need to keep their statistics of production up, and that Ethics action must be brought against the staff member responsible for the particular statistic should it be continually down.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Example: a typist gets out 500 letters in one week. That's a statistic. If the next week the typist gets out 600 letters that's an UP statistic. If the typist gets out 300 letters that's a DOWN statistic.... the purpose is to keep production (statistics) up." 

— L. Ron Hubbard, HCOPL 1 Sep 1965&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to ''[[The Scientology Handbook]]'', the Scientology method of statistics can, and should, be applied to individuals, groups, organizations, and any production activities inside and outside Scientology. Hubbard prescribes a very specific method of plotting statistics on graphs, and then for analysis of these graphs in terms of five levels of "Ethics Conditions". The main categories for these conditions are:

* Non-existence condition: line on graph steeply or vertically down.
* Danger condition: line on graph diagonally down.
* Emergency condition: line on graph remains level, or slightly down.
* Normal condition: line on graph slightly up.
* Affluence condition: line on graph steeply up.

According to ''The Scientology Handbook'', however, the complete set of conditions is as follows (ranked from highest to lowest)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Conditions: States of Operation|url=http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/conditions/sh10_2.htm|website=The Scientology Handbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
*Power
*Power Change
*Affluence
*Normal Operation
*Emergency
*Danger
*Non-Existence
*Liability
*Doubt
*Enemy
*Treason
*Confusion

==Ethics protection==
In 1965, Hubbard issued the policy letter HCOPL 1 Sep 1965 (reissued 5 Oct 1985) entitled "Ethics Protection". In it, he states that "Ethics actions are often used to handle down individual statistics. A person who is not doing his job becomes an Ethics target" and goes on to detail how a Scientologist can protect himself from Ethics punishment by being more productive and keeping statistics up:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In short, a staff member can get away with murder so long as his statistic is up and can't sneeze without a chop if it's down."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If the staff member's production is sufficiently high (as evidenced by an up statistic), the Scientologist gains an immunity to the Ethics process, even if they have openly committed violations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When people do start reporting a staff member with a high statistic, what you investigate is the person who turned in the report. In an ancient army a particularly brave deed was recognized by an award of the title of '''Kha-Khan'''. It was not a rank. The person remained what he was, BUT he was entitled to be forgiven the death penalty ten times in case in the future he did anything wrong. That was a Kha-Khan. That's what producing, high-statistic staff members are – Kha-Khans. They can get away with murder without a blink from Ethics.... And Ethics must recognize a Kha-Khan when it sees one – and tear up the bad report chits on the person with a yawn." &lt;ref&gt;Hubbard Communications Office, HCOPL 1 Sep 1965, "Ethics Protection".&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Punishment==
{{main|Scientology Justice}}
Researcher Jon Atack has expressed concern that, in the wrong hands, Scientology ethics can be wielded arbitrarily and absurdly, such as in the 1960s when British [[Saint Hill Manor|Saint Hill]] Scientologists declared a local pie shop "[[Suppressive Person|Suppressive]]" for not carrying apple pie in sufficient quantities to their liking.&lt;ref&gt;Atack, Jon, "A Piece of Blue Sky", Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical analysis==
Professor [[Stephen A. Kent]] quotes Hubbard as pronouncing that "the purpose of ethics is to remove counter intentions from the environment. And having accomplished that the purpose becomes to remove other intentionedness from the environment" and "(a)ll ethics is for in actual fact is simply that additional tool necessary to make it possible to get [Scientology] technology in. That's the whole purpose of ethics; to get technology in".

What this translates to, says Kent, is "a peculiar brand of morality that uniquely benefitted (the Church of Scientology) ... In plain English, the purpose of Scientology ethics is to eliminate opponents, then eliminate people's interests in things other than Scientology. In this 'ethical' environment, Scientology would be able to impose its courses, philosophy, and '[[Scientology Justice|justice system]]' – its so-called technology – onto society."&lt;ref name="Kent"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stephen A.

[[File:Witches'Familiars1579.jpg|thumb|A late 16th-century English illustration of a witch feeding her familiars.]] 

In European [[folklore]] and folk-belief of the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[Early Modern]] periods, '''familiar spirits''' (sometimes referred to simply as "'''familiars'''" or "'''animal guides'''") were believed to be supernatural entities that would assist [[witches]] and [[cunning folk]] in their practice of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil05|Wilby 2005]], pp. 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the records of the time, they would appear in numerous guises, often as an animal, but also at times as a human or humanoid figure, and were described as "clearly defined, three-dimensional… forms, vivid with colour and animated with movement and sound" by those alleging to have come into contact with them, unlike later descriptions of [[ghosts]] with their "smoky, undefined form[s]".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil05|Wilby 2005]], p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

When they served witches, they were often thought to be [[Evil|malevolent]], while when working for cunning folk they were often thought of as [[Good and evil|benevolent]] (although there was some ambiguity in both cases). The former were often categorised as [[demon]]s, while the latter were more commonly thought of and described as [[fairy|fairies]]. The main purpose of familiars is to serve the witch or young witch, providing protection for them as they come into their new powers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil05|Wilby 2005]], pp. 74-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 20th century a number of magical practitioners, including adherents of the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]], have begun to use the concept of familiars, due to their association with older forms of magic. These contemporary practitioners utilize pets, wildlife or believe that invisible spirit versions of familiars act as magical aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chauran|first=Alexandra |title=Animal Familiars for Beginners''|publisher=Jupiter Gardens Press|year=2013|isbn =1938257669 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre A. Riffard]] proposed this definition and quotations&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre A. Riffard]], ''Dictionnaire de l’ésotérisme'', Paris: Payot, 1983, p. 132; ''Nouveau dictionnaire de l’ésotérisme'', Paris: Payot, 2008, pp. 114-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The familiar spirit can be an animal (animal companion).}}

The French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]], a cat fancier, believed in familiar spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Baudelaire, ''The Flowers of Evil'' (1857), “The cat”, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. P. Elkin]] studied the belief in familiar spirits among the [[Australian Aborigines]]:
{{quote|A usual method, or explanation, is that the medicine man sends his familiar spirit (his assistant totem, spirit-dog, spirit-child or whatever the form may be) to gather the information. While this is occurring, the man himself is in a state of receptivity, in sleep or trance. In modern phraseology [spiritism], his familiar spirit would be the control [control spirit].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. P. Elkin]], ''Aboriginal men of high degree. Initiation and Sorcery in the World's Oldest Tradition'', 1945, 48. A spiritist medium allegedly loses consciousness and passes under control of some external force (called a “control spirit”), for the supposed transmission of communications from the dead, or messages for an individual or a group.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Mircea Eliade]]:
{{quote|The Goldi [Nanai people in Siberia] clearly distinguish between the tutelary spirit (''ayami''), which chooses the shaman, and the helping spirits (''syven''), which are subordinate to it and are granted to the shaman by the ''ayami'' itself. According to Sternberg the Goldi explain the relations between the shaman and his ''ayami'' by a complex sexual emotion. Here is the report of a Goldi shaman.

"Once I was asleep on my sick-bed, when a spirit approached me. It was a very beautiful woman. Her figure was very slight, she was no more than half an arshin (71 cm.) tall. Her face and attire were quite as those of one of our Gold women… She said: 'I am the ''ayami'' of your ancestors, the Shamans. I taught them shamaning. Now I am going to teach you… I love you, I have no husband now, you will be my husband and I shall be a wife unto you. I shall give you assistant spirits. You are to heal with their aid, and I shall teach and help you myself…' Sometimes she comes under the aspect of an old woman, and sometimes under that of a wolf, so she is terrible to look at. Sometimes she comes as a winged tiger… She has given me three assistants-the ''jarga'' (the panther), the ''doonto'' (the bear) and the ''amba'' (the tiger). They come to me in my dreams, and appear whenever I summon them while shamaning. If one of them refuses to come, the ''ayami'' makes them obey, but, they say, there are some who do not obey even the ''ayami''. When I am shamaning, the ''ayami'' and the assistant spirits are possessing me; whether big or small, they penetrate me, as smoke or vapour would. When the ''ayami'' is within me, it is she who speaks through my mouth, and she does everything herself."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Eliade]], ''Shamanism. Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'' (1968), Princeton University Press, 2004, 72, quoting Leo Sternberg, ''Divine Election in Primitive Religion'', Congrès International des Américanistes,1924, 476 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Descriptions ==

Among those accused witches and cunning-folk who described their familiar spirits, there were commonly certain unifying features. The historian [[Emma Wilby]] noted how the accounts of such familiars were striking for their "ordinariness" and "naturalism", despite the fact that they were dealing with [[supernatural]] entities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil05|Wilby 2005]], p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Familiar spirits were most commonly small animals, such as cats, rats, dogs, ferrets, birds, frogs, toads, and hares. There were also cases of wasps and butterflies, as well as pigs, sheep, and horses. Familiar spirits were usually kept in pots or baskets lined with sheep’s wool and fed a variety of things including, milk, bread, meat, and blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Malevolent Nurture|last=Willis|first=Deborah|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=New York|pages=32, 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Familiar spirits usually had names and "were often given down-to-earth, and frequently affectionate, nicknames."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil05|Wilby 2005]], p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this was Tom Reid, who was the familiar of the cunning-woman and accused witch [[Bessie Dunlop]], while other examples included Grizell and Gridigut, who were the familiars of 17th century [[Huntingdonshire]] witch Jane Wallis.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil05|Wilby 2005]], pp. 60-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Agathion''' is a familiar spirit which appears in the shape of a human or an animal, or even within a [[Amulet|talisman]], bottle or magic ring. It is strongest at midday.&lt;ref name="Bane"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bane, Theresa.|title=Encyclopedia of Demons in World Religions and Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njDRfG6YVb8C&amp;pg=PA21|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson|isbn=978-0-7864-8894-0|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Familiars can also hold the form of human beings, living life as a human in the corporeal world. These familiars often have child-like personalities, usually closely identifying with mythical fairies, woodland nymphs, trolls, elves, butterflies, small birds and cats. 
This form of familiar holds a great amount of purity, a type of energy and a metaphysical power that is directly connected to their charge. This form of familiar acts as a spiritual battery or amplifier for their charge, often to help them focus or harness their spiritual energies.These familiars are usually very closely connected to their charge, often never wanting to be apart. They sometimes find it physically painful or draining when separated. [Citation needed]

== Relationship between magical practitioner and familiar ==
[[File:Matthewhopkins.png|thumb|250px|Frontispiece from the witch hunter [[Matthew Hopkins]]' ''The Discovery of Witches'' (1647), showing witches identifying their familiar spirits.]]

Using her studies into the role of witchcraft and magic in Britain during the Early Modern period as a starting point, the historian [[Emma Wilby]] examined the relationship that familiar spirits allegedly had with the witches and cunning-folk in this period.

=== Meeting ===
In the British accounts from the Early Modern period at least, there were three main types of encounter narrative related to how a witch or cunning person first met their familiar. The first of these was that the spirit spontaneously appeared in front of the individual while they were going about their daily activities, either in their home or outdoors somewhere. Various examples for this are attested in the sources of the time, for instance, Joan Prentice from [[Essex]], England, gave an account when she was interrogated for witchcraft in 1589 claiming that she was "alone in her chamber, and sitting upon a low stool preparing herself to bedward" when her familiar first appeared to her, while the Cornish cunning-woman Anne Jeffries related in 1645 that hers first appeared to her when she was "knitting in an arbour in our garden".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil05|Wilby 2005]], p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second manner in which the familiar spirit commonly appeared to magical practitioners in Britain was that they would be given to a person by a pre-existing individual, who was sometimes a family member and at other times a more powerful spirit. For instance, the alleged witch Margaret Ley from [[Liverpool]] claimed, in 1667, that she had been given her familiar spirit by her mother when she died, while the [[Leicestershire]] cunning-woman Joan Willimot related, in 1618, that a mysterious figure whom she only referred to as her "master", "willed her to open her mouth and he would blow into her a fairy which should do her good. And that she open her mouth, and that presently after blowing, there came out of her mouth a spirit which stood upon the ground in the shape and form of a woman."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil05|Wilby 2005]], pp. 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a number of accounts, the cunning person or witch was experiencing difficulty prior to the appearance of the familiar, who offered to aid them. As historian [[Emma Wilby]] noted, "their problems… were primarily rooted in the struggle for physical survival—the lack of food or money, bereavement, sickness, loss of livelihood and so on", and the familiar offered them a way out of this by giving them magical powers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil05|Wilby 2005]], pp. 66-67, 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working relationship ===

In some cases, the magical practitioner then made an agreement or entered a pact with their familiar spirit. The length of time that the witch or cunning person worked with their familiar spirit varied between a few weeks through to a number of decades.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil05|Wilby 2005]], p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, the magical practitioner would conjure their familiar spirit when they needed their assistance, although there are many different ways that they did this: the Essex witch Joan Cunny claimed, in 1589, that she had to kneel down within a circle and pray to [[Satan]] for her familiar to appear while the Wiltshire cunning woman Anne Bodenham described, in 1653, that she conjured her familiars by reading books. In some rarer cases there were accounts where the familiars would appear at times when they were unwanted and not called upon, for instance the Huntingdonshire witch Elizabeth Chandler noted, in 1646, that she could not control when her two familiars, named Beelzebub and Trullibub, appeared to her, and had prayed for a god to "deliver her therefrom".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil05|Wilby 2005]], pp. 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Travels to Fairyland or the Sabbath ===
Familiars are most common in western European mythology, with some scholars arguing that familiars are only present in the traditions of Great Britain and France. In these areas three categories of familiars are believed to exist:&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Murray|M. A. Murray]], ''Divination by Witches’ Familiars.'' Man. Vol. 18 June 1918. Pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

* human familiars, throughout Western Europe
* [[divinatory]] animals, Great Britain and France
* malevolent animals, only in [[Greece]]

==Prince Rupert's dog==
[[File:Prince Rupert - 1st English Civil War.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Rupert and his "familiar" dog in a pamphlet titled "The Cruel Practices of Prince Rupert" (1643).]]

During the [[English Civil War]], the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] general [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] was in the habit of taking his large [[poodle]] dog named [[Boye (dog)|Boye]] into battle with him. Throughout the war the dog was greatly feared among the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces and credited with supernatural powers. As noted by Morgan,&lt;ref&gt;William Morgan, ''Superstition in Medieval and Early Modern Society'', Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; the dog was apparently considered a kind of familiar. At the end of the war the dog was shot, allegedly with a [[silver bullet]].

==Witch trials==
Most data regarding familiars comes from the transcripts of English and Scottish witch trials held during the 16th-17th centuries. The court system that labeled and tried witches was known as the [[Essex]]. The Essex trial of [[Agnes Sampson]] of Nether Keith, [[East Lothian]] in [[Scotland]] in 1590, presents prosecution testimony regarding a divinatory familiar. This case is fundamentally political, trying Sampson for high treason, and accusing Sampson for employing witchcraft against [[King James VI]]. The prosecution asserts Sampson called familiar spirits and resolved her doubtful matter. Another Essex trial is that of Hellen Clark, tried in 1645, in which Hellen was compelled to state that [[The Devil]] appeared as a "familiar" in the form of a dog.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Murray|M. A. Murray]], ''Witches familiars in England.'' Man, Vol. 18 July 1918, pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English court cases reflect a strong relationship between State's accusations of witchcraft against those who practiced ancient indigenous traditions, including the familiar animal or spirit.

In some cases familiars replace children in the favour of their mothers. (See [[witchcraft and children]].)

In colonial America animal familiars can be seen in the witch hunts that took place in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692. Familiar spirits often appear in the visions of the afflicted girls. Although the 1648 law that defined a witch as one who "hath or consulteth with a familiar spirit" had been suspended ten years earlier, association with a familiar spirit was used in the [[Salem witch trials|Salem trials]] as evidence to convict suspected witches. Sarah Good was said to have a yellow bird who sucked between her fingers. Ann Putnam in particular frequently saw the yellow bird in her afflictions. [[Tituba]] was known to have seen strange animals that urged her to hurt children, these included, a hog, a black dog, a red cat, and a black cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Devil's Snare: The Salem Witchcraft Crisis of 1692|last=Norton|first=Mary Beth|publisher=Vintage Books|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=26, 28, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Witches' mark|witch’s mark]] added a sexual component to the familiar spirit and is often found in trial records as a way to convict a suspected witch. The mark was most commonly an extra teat found somewhere on the body and was suspected to be used to suckle the familiar spirits. An example of this can be seen in the Salem witch trials of 1692. For example, Ann Putnam told Martha Corey that, "ther is a yellow burd a sucking between your fore finger and midel finger I see it"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Devil's Snare|last=Norton|first=Mary Beth|publisher=Vintage Books|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:The Love Potion.jpg|thumb|"[[The Love Potion]]" by [[Evelyn De Morgan]]: a witch with a [[black cat]] familiar at her feet.]]

== Legacy ==

=== Folk tales ===
Historian Emma Wilby identified recurring motifs in various European [[Folklore|folk tales]] and [[fairy tales]] that she believed displayed a belief in familiar spirits. She noted that in such tales as [[Rumpelstiltskin]], [[Puss-in-Boots]] and the [[The Frog Prince (story)|Frog Prince]], the protagonist is approached by a supernatural being when they are in need of aid, something that she connected to the appearance of familiar spirits in the Early Modern accounts of them.&lt;ref name="Wilby"&gt;[[#Wil05|Wilby 2005]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed there to be a direct connection between the belief in and accounts of familiar spirits with these folk tales because "These fairy stories and myths originate from the same reservoir of folk belief as the descriptions of familiar-encounters given by cunning-folk and witches".&lt;ref name="Wilby" /&gt;

===Historiography===
Recent scholarship on familiars exhibits the depth and respectability absent from earlier demonological approaches. The study of familiars has grown from an academic topic in folkloric journals to a general topic in popular books and journals incorporating anthropology, history and other disciplines. James Sharpe, in ''The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft: the Western Tradition'', states: "Folklorists began their investigations in the 19th Century [and] found that familiars figured prominently in ideas about witchcraft."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sharpe |first= James |author2=Rickard M Golden |title= Familiars in the Encyclopedia of Witchcraft: the Western Tradition |publisher= ABC-CLIO |year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, folklorists fired the imagination of scholars who would, in decades to come, write descriptive volumes on witches and familiars. Examples of the growth and development of familiar scholarship are found in ''Folklore'', which consistently contributes articles on traditional beliefs in England and early modern Europe.

In the first decades of the 20th century, familiars are identified as "niggets", which are "creepy-crawly things that witches kept all over them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Times |first=The |authorlink=The Times |title=Superstition in Essex: A Witch and Her Niggets |journal=Folklore |volume=27 |year=1916 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Murray]] delves into variations of the familiar found in witchcraft practices. Many of the sources she employs are trial records and demonological texts from early to modern England. These include the 1556 Essex Witchcraft Trials of the Witches of Hatfield Perevil, the 1582 Trial of the Witches of St. Osyth, and the 1645 Essex Trials with [[Matthew Hopkins|Matthew Hopkins acting as a Witch-finder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murray |first=Margaret |authorlink=Margaret Murray

 |doi=10.2307/2787283 |jstor=2787283 |publisher=Man, Vol. 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, Murray published ''The Witch Cult in Western Europe''. Her information concerning familiars comes from witchcraft trials in Essex in the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Murray |first= Margaret A. |title= The Witch-Cult in Western Europe |publisher= Clarendon Press |year= 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this book Murray dedicates an entire chapter to the familiar spirit. Her detailed contribution to the topic included several court cases and accounts from Europe in which she finds mention of familiars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Witch-Cult in Western Europe|last=Murray|first=Margaret|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1921|isbn=|location=London|pages=205-237}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Mary Beth Norton's ''In the Devils Snare'' published in 2002, discusses the [[Salem witch trials|Salem witchcraft]] crisis of 1692. She frequently references familiar spirits as she explores the trials of the Salem witches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Devil's Snare|last=Norton|first=Mary Beth|publisher=Vintage Books|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=26, 28, 48, 55, 64, 80, 140, 148, 158, 200-201, 205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Appearances ==
Familiars are featured in the hit [[Netflix]] series, ''[[Chilling Adventures of Sabrina]]''. Her familiar is a black stray cat.

The Witch (The VVitch) also features small animals (a rabbit) as familiars.

[[Image:Agni 18th century miniature.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Agni]] the [[Hindu]] deity of fire, has a very prominent place among [[Rigvedic]] deities.]]
[[Worship]] or deification of [[fire]] (also '''pyrodulia''', '''pyrolatry''' or '''pyrolatria''') is known from various [[religion]]s. Fire has been an important part of [[homo (genus)|human]] culture since the [[Lower Paleolithic]]. The earliest known traces of [[Control of fire by early humans|controlled fire]] were found at the [[Daughters of Jacob Bridge]], [[Israel]], and dated to 790,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goren-Inbar|first=Naama|last2=Alperson|first2=Nira|last3=Kislev|first3=Mordechai E.|last4=Simchoni|first4=Orit|last5=Melamed|first5=Yoel|last6=Ben-Nun|first6=Adi|last7=Werker|first7=Ella|date=2004-04-30|title=Evidence of Hominin Control of Fire at Gesher Benot Ya'aqov, Israel|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/304/5671/725|journal=Science|language=en|volume=304|issue=5671|pages=725–727|doi=10.1126/science.1095443|issn=0036-8075|pmid=15118160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious or [[animist]] notions connected to fire are assumed to reach back to such early pre-''[[Homo sapiens]]'' times.

==Indo-European religions==
In [[Indo-European languages]], there were two concepts regarding fire: that of an animate type called *''egni-'' (cf. [[Sanskrit]] ''agni'' English ''ignite'' from Latin ''ignis'', and Russian ''ogon''), and an inanimate type *''paewr-'' (cf. English - ''fire'', Greek ''pyr'', Sanskrit ''pu''). A similar distinction existed for [[water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=fire&amp;searchmode=none |title=Fire | publisher=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologically, the earliest evidence for Indo-Iranian fire worship is found at the transition from the [[Sintashta culture|Sintashta-Petrovka]] to the [[Fedorovo culture]] around 1500 BC, together with first evidence of [[cremation]]. While cremation became ubiquitous in Hinduism, it came to be disavowed in Zoroastrianism. However, even earlier
evidences of vedic fire altars have been found at the Indus Valley sites of [[Kalibangan]] and [[Lothal]], giving rise to speculations toward earlier assumed the geographical location of the early Indo-Iranians.

Although the term "fire-worshippers" is primarily associated with [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], the idea that Zoroastrians worship fire is originally from anti-Zoroastrian polemic. Instead, fire&amp;mdash;even in a [[Fire temple]] (the Zoroastrian terms are more prosaic and simply mean "house of fire")&amp;mdash;is considered to be an agent of purity and as a symbol of righteousness and truth. In the present day this is explained to be because fire burns ever-upward and cannot itself be polluted. Nonetheless, [[Sadeh]] and [[Chaharshanbe Suri]] are both fire-related festivals celebrated throughout [[Greater Iran]] and date back to when Zoroastrianism was still the predominant religion of the region.

In Vedic disciplines of [[Hinduism]],  fire is a central element in the [[Yajna]] ceremony, with [[Agni]], "fire", playing the role as mediator between the worshipper and the other gods. Related concepts are the [[Agnihotra]] ritual, the invocation of the healing properties of fire; the [[Agnicayana]] ritual, which is the building of a fire altar to Agni; and [[Agnistoma]], which is one of the seven [[Somayajna]]s. In the Vaishnav branch of [[Hinduism]], Agni or Fire is considered the tongue of the Supreme Lord Narayana, hence all the sacrifices done even to any demigod ultimately is a sacrifice to the Supreme Lord Narayana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Madhulika Sharma |title=Fire Worship in Ancient India |publisher=Jaipur Publication Scheme |year=2002 |isbn=978-81-86782-57-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fire worship in Graeco-Roman tradition had two separate forms: fire of the [[hearth]] and fire of the [[forge]]. Hearth worship was maintained in Rome by the [[Vestal Virgins]], who served the goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], protector of the home, who had a sacred flame as the symbol of her presence in the city (''cf.'' [[Sacred fire of Vesta]]). The Greek equivalent of the goddess was [[Hestia]], whose worship is less well attested. The fire of the forge was associated with the Greek god [[Hephaestus]] and the Roman equivalent [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]. These two seem to have served both as craft-guild patrons and as protectors against accidental fires in cities. Also associated with fire is the [[Titan (mythology)|titanic god]] [[Prometheus]], who stole fire for humans from the gods. Most forms of worship in Graeco-Roman religion involved either cooking or burning completely an animal on a fire made on an [[altar]] in front of a [[temple]] (''see'' [[hecatomb]]).

[[Celtic mythology]] had [[Belenus]], whose name, "shining one", associated him with fire.

In [[Slavic mythology]], [[Svarog]], meaning "bright and clear", was the spirit of fire. The best known and dramatic among numerous Slavic Pagan fire [[ritual]]s is the jumping over the bonfire on the [[Ivan Kupala Day]].

==Semitic religions==
Fire is an element of [[theophany]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]'s [[burning bush]], [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]], and the flame of the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]]. The highest form of sacrifice was the [[Burnt offering (Judaism)|Korban Olah]], performed twice-daily, which is an [[animal sacrifice]] completely [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|consumed by fire]].

Islam on the other hand has no rituals associated with fire and burning. The Quran describes the devil as a creature of fire. The devil's rejection and contempt toward man originate from the devil's perception that fire is superior to mud. This sentiment was the cause of the devil's banishment from the heavens.

==Modern religions==
{{Expand section|date=October 2009}}
Fire continues to be a part of many human religions and cultures. For example, it is used in [[cremation]] and [[bonfire]]s; [[candle]]s are used in various religious ceremonies; [[eternal flame]]s are used to remind of notable occasions; and the [[Olympic Flame]] burns for the duration of the [[Olympic Games|games]].

The [[Holy Fire]] in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] has been consecutively documented since 1106 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.holyfire.org/eng/index.htm | title=Holy Fire.

The '''Four Mothers Society''' or '''Four Mothers Nation''' is a religious, political, and traditionalist organization of [[Muscogee Creek]], [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]] people, as well as the [[Natchez people]] enrolled in these tribes, in [[Oklahoma]]. It was formed as an opposition movement to the allotment policies of the [[Dawes Commission]] and various US Congressional acts in the 1890s. The society is religious in nature and opposed allotment because dividing tribal lands broke up tribal communities and resulted in "surplus" lands being seized and made available to non-Natives.

There were over 24,000 members at the organization's peak.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lrf0SN33dcYC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28|title=Blood Matters: The Five Civilized Tribes and the Search for Unity in the Twentieth Century|last=Zissu|first=Erik March|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Psychology Press|year=|isbn=9780415930864|location=|pages=28 - 29|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Image:Chittoharjo.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Portrait of Chitto Harjo, c. 1900]]
The Four Mothers Society, though it may have existing unrecognized for much of the 19th century,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; was formally founded as a dues-collecting organization about 1895 in [[Sulphur Springs, Indian Territory|Sulphur Springs]], and continued in this legal incarnation until 1915, and likely much later. The naming is significant as Cherokee mothers are believed to be descended from [[Cherokee mythology#The Story of Corn and Medicine|Selu]], the Corn Mother;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHP3gEdmtwMC&amp;pg=PA133|title=Cherokee Women In Crisis: Trail of Tears, Civil War, and Allotment, 1838-1907|last=Johnston|first=Carolyn|date=2003-10-06|publisher=University of Alabama Press|year=|isbn=9780817350567|location=|pages=133|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it may also refer to the [[Four Directions|four directions]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hKB7AmyP5cC&amp;pg=PA98|title=The Encyclopedia of Native American Legal Tradition|last=Johansen|first=Bruce Elliott|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780313301674|location=|pages=98 - 101|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the passage of the [[Curtis Act]] in 1898 and [[Dawes Act]], allotment became US policy and the various tribal governments were forced to allot land. The fact that the existing governments broke up the land was considered an outrage by many of members of the Four Mothers Societies. [[Chitto Harjo]] set up a new Creek government in [[Henryetta, Oklahoma|Henryetta]], which was acknowledged as the legitimate government by many of the Creeks. In 1900 a meeting was held at Hickory ceremonial grounds in which [[Pleasant Porter]] and his government was declared to have violated the 1867 Creek Constitution.  They declared Porter's government invalid and declared Harjo to be the new principal chief.

[[Redbird Smith]] also became involved in the Four Mothers Society.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1906, the group submitted a petition of one hundred eighty-six signatures to Congress, so that a delegation could be sent to Washington, D.C. to discuss treaty violations and their concerns over official tribal leadership.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Harjo spoke before the Senate, supported by the Four Mothers Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5kSfhZzFQYC&amp;pg=PA102|title=The Color of the Land: Race, Nation, and the Politics of Landownership in Oklahoma, 1832-1929|last=Chang|first=David A.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|year=|isbn=9780807833650|location=|pages=102|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Four Mothers Society was associated with the movement for a [[State of Sequoyah]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Besides openly opposing allotment, the Four Mothers Societies maintain ceremonial groups for [[stomp dance]]s, [[stickball (Native American)|stickball games]], feasts, meetings, and ceremonies. In the late 1980s there was at least one dance ground left among the Chickasaw and another among the Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V3Zu7p_tSyIC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;lpg=PA308&amp;dq=Four+Mothers+Societies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FOYvrMZ14d&amp;sig=iutR12VxjGM7F6FJjOhLWg8J7YI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HoxiTu2_LMPi0QHT3IH-CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Thomas E.

[[File:Dr Friedrich Rosen 1910.jpg|thumb|Friedrich Rosen, 1910]]

'''Friedrich Rosen''' or '''Fritz Rosen''' ([[Leipzig]], August 30, 1856 – November 27, 1935, [[Beijing]]) was a German [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]], [[diplomat]] and [[politician]]. From May to October 1921 he was the Foreign Minister of Germany.

== Background ==

Friedrich Rosen's grandfather, Friedrich Ballhorn-Rosen, was Chancellor of the [[Principality of Lippe]]; his father, [[Georg Rosen (1821–1891)|Georg Rosen]], an orientalist, published writings on Islam. However, Georg Rosen decided to enter the [[diplomatic service]] of [[Prussia]].  He was active as a [[consul (representative)|consul]] in the [[Middle East]] and the [[Balkans]]. Friedrich's mother Serena Anna, daughter of [[Ignaz Moscheles]], came from a British scholarly family of Jewish faith (who had converted to Christianity).

== Early years ==

In this cosmopolitan atmosphere, Friedrich Rosen was born in 1856 in [[Leipzig]]. However, he grew up in [[Jerusalem]], where his father was consul. Friedrich Rosen enjoyed an education in four languages ([[German (language)|German]], English, [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] and [[Turkish (language)|Turkish]]). He early decided to study modern and oriental languages, which brought him to [[Berlin]], [[Leipzig]], [[Göttingen]], and [[Paris]]. After graduating, he worked for several months in [[London]] as a tutor for the children of [[Frederick Temple Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood]], the [[viceroy of India]].

He retained a basically [[anglophilic]] attitude and a passion for oriental culture all his life. From 1887 onwards, he taught [[Persian (language)|Persian]] and [[Urdu]] at the Department of Oriental Languages of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]] in Berlin.

== Diplomatic career ==

After a dispute with the university department leadership in 1890, he gave up his academic position, and as his father before him he entered a career at the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]].  He was employed as a representative in [[Beirut]] and [[Tehran]], until 1898 when he was placed in charge of establishing a consulate in [[Baghdad]].

The diplomatic work in the [[Middle East]] was compatible with Rosen's orientalist interests. He was conversant in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], and obtained an intimate knowledge of [[Persian culture]]. In  1890, he published a ''modern Persian grammar'', with [[Nāsir al-Din Shāh]], the [[Shah]] of [[Iran]], as co-author; parts of the diary of the latter were employed as texts. In 1899, he accompanied the archeologist [[Gertrude Bell]] on her visit to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, KT., M.A. &amp; Litt.D. Cambridge, M.A. &amp; D.Litt. Oxford, D.LiT. Durham, F.S.A. [http://fax.libs.uga.edu/DS49xB8x1920/1f/by_nile_and_tigris_v2.txt A NARRATIVE OF JOURNEYS IN EGYPT AND MESOPOTAMIA ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM BETWEEN THE YEARS 1886 AND 1913], journal in the library of the [[University of Georgia]], [[Athens, Georgia]], 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his travel to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] appointed Rosen as [[List of German consuls in Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa and Eilat#German consuls and consuls general|consul in Jerusalem]]. Only two years later in 1900, he was appointed to the Political Department of Foreign Affairs. Rosen was considered as an expert on the Arab world. Moreover, like his friend [[Wilhelm Solf]], he held liberal views, and simultaneously supported the monarchy and was an anglophile, and thus was considered as the right person for achieving an understanding with [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

From 1904 to 1905, Friedrich Rosen represented the interests of the German Empire in [[Ethiopia]], in what after him was called the Rosengesandtschaft ("the Rosen Embassy"). Ethiopia hardly had as good relations with any other major power as with Germany. Returning to Europe, Rosen was appointed [[envoy (title)|envoy]] in [[Tangiers]]. From 1910 to 1912, Rosen was envoy in [[Bucharest]], and from 1912 to 1916 in [[Lisbon]]. In 1916, Germany declared war to [[Portugal]], with thoughts of a German Central Africa in mind. Rosen returned with free passage back to his homeland.

[[Wilhelm II]] then appointed him as envoy in [[The Hague]], where he remained until his ascent to a high political position. Still as envoy, he helped preparing and visited the former Kaiser Wilhelm in his exile at [[Huis Doorn]], a visit which the German public noted with mixed feelings.

== Foreign minister ==

In the spring of 1921 the [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|German chancellor]], [[Joseph Wirth]], appointed Rosen as [[Foreign Minister]]. On the issue of [[World War I reparations|war reparations]], the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]]'s Wirth considered an anglophilic and also [[independent (politician)|independent]] foreign minister to be advantageous. In the five months Rosen's tenure lasted, he acquired a peace treaty with the United States as a permanent result.

Rosen retired in protest against the [[London ultimatum]], in which the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers combined demands of high reparations from Germany with threats of [[International sanctions|sanctions]]. He considered the policy of the victorious powers as an application of [[double standards]]: On the one hand, they would proclaim the [[self-determination]] of peoples, but on the other hand showed no respect to the [[referendum]] in [[Upper Silesia]], where a 60 percent majority voted in favour of retaining the area as a part of Germany.

Thus, Friedrich Rosen retired in October 1921 from [[civil service]]. Following the same policy, Wirth named [[Walther Rathenau]] as his successor, who was committed to similar principles.

== Orientalist again ==

Rosen became chairman of the [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft|German Oriental Society]], the umbrella organization of the Orientalists in Germany, and dedicated himself increasingly to scientific work. In this field, his today still well-known translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat]]'' of [[Omar Khayyam]] has been published in several editions.

Since the [[Machtergreifung|seizure of power]] by the Nazis, whose ideology Friedrich Rosen opposed from the beginning, the former Foreign Minister was subjected to anti-Semitic hatred, because of his descent. Hence until his death he maintained contact with the [[SeSiSo Club]] of his friend [[Wilhelm Solf]], from which a few years later the resistance group [[Solf Circle]] developed.

As the result of a fracture, Friedrich Rosen died in 1935 during a stay in [[Beijing]], where his son [[Georg Rosen (1895–1961)|Dr. Georg Rosen]] was working at the German embassy. Because of the racist policy of the Nazi regime, the younger Dr. Rosen, who was sending reports to the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin about the [[Nanjing Massacre]], was forced to retire from the diplomatic service in 1938.

Please do not change.--&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;!--Do not change, this is correct.--&gt; Allin'''; August 29, 1956 – June 28, 1993) was an American singer, songwriter and record producer, who performed and recorded with many groups during his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=SELF HATRED FANZINE|title=GG Allin's Last Interview June '93|date=2014-10-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn4jd_Pc0T4|accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; GG Allin was best known for his outlandish live performances, which often featured [[transgressive art|transgressive]] acts, including [[coprophagia]], self-mutilation, and attacking audience members, for which he was arrested and imprisoned on multiple occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-26/entertainment/ca-836_1_rock-singer|title=Pop/rock|publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|accessdate=March 10, 2012|date=August 26, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllMusic]] and [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]]'s ''[[That's Tough]]'' have called him "the most spectacular degenerate in rock &amp; roll history"&lt;ref name="allmusic-bio"&gt;{{cite web |last=Huey |first=Steve |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gg-allin-mn0000199240/biography |title=GG Allin Biography |publisher=[[AllMusic.com]]|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "toughest rock star in the world", respectively.

Known more for his notorious stage antics than for his music, he recorded prolifically, not only in the punk rock genre, but also in [[spoken word]], [[country music|country]], and more traditional-style rock. His lyrics, which often expressed themes of [[misogyny]], [[pedophilia]], [[blasphemy]] and [[racism]], polarized listeners and created varied opinions of him within the highly politicized punk community. When questioned about his music and shows, Allin often replied that he was trying to make rock music "dangerous" again.

Allin's music was often poorly recorded and produced, given limited distribution, and met with mostly negative reviews from critics,&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;{{cite web | last =Huey | first =Steve | title =GG Allin Biography | publisher = All Music | date = | url ={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p51370/biography|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate = July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=gg_allin_and_the_jabbers |title=G.G.

==Early life==
Allin was born &lt;!--GG's birth name was Jesus Christ Allin(nah, what's his name for real? Jesus Christ Allin, sorry). His name was changed to Kevin Michael Allin early in his adolescence. Please do not change.--&gt;Jesus Christ Allin&lt;!--Do not change, this is correct.--&gt; at Weeks Memorial Hospital in [[Lancaster, New Hampshire]], the younger of two sons born to Merle Colby Allin, Sr. and Arleta Gunther.&lt;ref name="Allmusic"/&gt; He was given this name because his father told his wife that [[Jesus Christ]] had [[vision (spirituality)|visited]] him, and told him that his newborn son would be a great man in the vein of the [[Messiah]].&lt;ref name="Allmusic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/ekx001/MG/BR135MG.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050119052826/http://www.geocities.com/ekx001/MG/BR135MG.html |archivedate=January 19, 2005 |title=The GG Allin SuperSite Media Guide – Boston Rock – No.&amp;nbsp;135 – 1993 |publisher=Geocities.com |date=March 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During early childhood, his older brother, [[Merle Allin|Merle]], was unable to pronounce "Jesus" properly and called him "Jeje",&lt;ref&gt;Youtube: ''GG Allin's mother explains why he was named "Jesus Christ" when he was a baby'' (excerpt from ''Raw, Brutal, Rough &amp; Bloody''): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nciiY0lvVo (2:20)&lt;/ref&gt; which became "GG". The family lived in a [[log cabin]] with no running water or electricity in [[Groveton, New Hampshire]]. Merle Sr. was an abusive recluse and religious fanatic, who threatened his family with death, digging graves in their cellar.&lt;ref name="rockstarmartyr.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockstarmartyr.net/eat-shit-and-die-gg-allins-first-name-was-jesus-christ/|title=Eat Shit and Die: GG Allin’s First Name Was Jesus Christ|publisher=|accessdate=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an essay titled "The First Ten Years", Allin wrote that his father wanted to kill his family in a murder-suicide. He "despised pleasure" and allowed his family "very little contact with others". They lived a "primitive existence" and "were more like prisoners than a family". Allin also stated that his mother attempted to escape before she filed for divorce, but Merle Sr. thwarted the attempt by kidnapping Allin.&lt;ref&gt;Lifestory: GG Allin (including relevant excerpt of The First Ten Years) {{cite web |url=http://www.tincan.tv/features/music/382/life-story-gg-allin/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101101512/http://www.tincan.tv/features/music/382/life-story-gg-allin/ |archivedate=January 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Full text of The First Ten Years http://www.oocities.org/kissingtheflames/writings.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Allin said that he was glad to experience such an upbringing, and that it "made [him] a warrior soul at an early age."&lt;ref name="rockstarmartyr.net"/&gt;

In 1961, Arleta filed for divorce from Merle Sr., as his mental instability was worsening. Allin and his brother were from that time raised by their mother and stepfather, and settled in [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|East St. Johnsbury]], [[Vermont]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="Allmusic"/&gt; Arleta changed her younger son's legal name to Kevin Michael Allin on March 2, 1962, during his first year of schooling. Arleta had allowed his birth name to stand until this point and finally changed it to give her son a chance of a mockery-free childhood.

Allin, a poor student, was placed in [[special education]] classes and required to repeat the third grade. According to his older brother, he experienced bullying by fellow students for nonconformity.&lt;ref name="hated"&gt;''[[Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies]]''.  Dir: [[Todd Phillips]], 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Tenth grade#United States|second year]] of high school, he began attending school [[cross-dressing|cross-dressed]], which he said was inspired by the [[New York Dolls]].&lt;ref name="hated"/&gt; When asked about his childhood, Allin said that it was "very chaotic. Full of chances and dangers. We sold drugs, stole, broke into houses, cars. Did whatever we wanted to for the most part – including all the bands we played in. People even hated us back then."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/ekx001/MG/CMMG.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210210355/http://www.geocities.com/ekx001/MG/CMMG.html|archivedate=December 10, 2007|title=The GG Allin SuperSite Media Guide – Chairs Missing – 1989 |publisher=Geocities.com |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording career==

===Early years===
Allin's earliest musical influences were 1960s [[British Invasion]] bands including [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and [[the Dave Clark Five]].&lt;ref name="hated-merleinterview"&gt;''[[Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies]]'' – Bonus features, "Merle &amp; Dino Interview". Minute marker 0:00:23: "We were into, y'know, all the early British Invasion stuff, like the early-mid 60s... The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones, and The Dave Clark 5, and The Monkees, and all that kind of stuff, you know."&lt;/ref&gt; In the early '70s, [[Alice Cooper]] became a large influence on Allin.&lt;ref name="ytmom"&gt;{{YouTube|eu8RRujy2RQ|Interview with GG Allin's mother part 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allin's earliest recorded musical endeavors were as a drummer. In his mid-teens, he and his older brother Merle, who plays [[bass guitar]] formed their first band, Little Sister's Date, which lasted a little over a year.&lt;ref name="hated-merleinterview" /&gt; The group covered songs by [[Aerosmith]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], and other popular [[hard rock]] bands of the time period.&lt;ref name="hated-merleinterview" /&gt; 
Both Allin and his brother Merle gained a strong interest in [[punk rock]]. [[The Ramones]] and [[The Stooges]] were a strong influence on Allin. 

Allin graduated from Concord High School in [[Concord, Vermont]] in 1975, and shortly after formed the band Malpractice with his older brother, local musician Jeff Penny, and Brian Demurs (a high school friend). Allin played the drums for Malpractice until the band separated in 1977. He then became the drummer for the band Stripsearch, who released one 7" single, containing the songs "Galileo" and "Jesus Over New York".

From September 1977 to April 1984, Allin performed as front man for [[The Jabbers]], in which he played drums and performed vocals. Allin's 1980 debut album was ''[[Always Was, Is and Always Shall Be]]'' for Orange Records. It would be reissued for the first time on CD in 1995 by the Halycon imprint.  At one point, industry veteran and [[The Dead Boys]] producer [[Genya Ravan]] served as his manager. Tension within The Jabbers mounted as Allin grew uncontrollable, uncompromising and vicious. The Jabbers disbanded.

Allin fronted many acts during the early to mid-1980s. This includes albums from The Cedar Street Sluts, The Scumfucs in 1982 and The Texas Nazis in 1985. Allin remained in the [[Underground music|underground]] [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] scene yet was not part of the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] hardcore scene. His performances in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]] with the Cedar Street Sluts earned him the nickname of "the madman of Manchester."

Allin gained wider attention with the [[ROIR]] cassette-only release of ''[[Hated in the Nation (album)|Hated in the Nation]]'' (1987) containing tracks from Allin's out-of-print catalog with The Jabbers, The Scumfucs and Cedar Street Sluts. The tape also featured several in-studio and in-concert recordings with an all-star band assembled by producer ''[[Maximum RocknRoll]]'' and early Allin patron [[Mykel Board]]. This band featured [[J Mascis]] of [[Dinosaur Jr.]] on lead guitar and [[Bongwater (band)|Bongwater]] record producer/musician [[Kramer (musician)|Mark Kramer]] on bass.

===Mid era and more extreme live performances===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
By the mid- to late-1980s, Allin was addicted to heroin and alcohol and generally abused any intoxicants provided to him.

Allin first defecated onstage in 1985 at a show in [[Peoria, Illinois]].  According to fellow performer Bloody Mess, "I was with him when he bought the [[Ex-Lax]]. Unfortunately, he ate it hours before the show, so he constantly had to hold it in or he would've shit before he got onstage... After he shit onstage, complete chaos broke out in the hall... All of the old men in charge of the hall went fucking NUTS!.. Hundreds of confused punk kids were flipping out, running out the door, because the smell was INCREDIBLE."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/swedishscum/bloodymess/interview.html|title=Bloody Mess Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Defecation]] became a regular part of his stage act.

Allin described himself as "the last true rock and roller": by this, he meant that rock and roll music itself had started as an embodiment of danger, [[anti-authoritarian]]ism and rebelliousness but had become largely taken over by corporations and business concerns. Allin's music and performances were thus meant to return rock and roll to what he saw as its roots, reclaiming it from the corporate system.

Allin idolized country music legend [[Hank Williams]] and saw himself as a kindred spirit. Both were relative loners and outsiders, both were habitual users of intoxicants, both lived with few, if any, possessions and both traveled the country relentlessly. Allin's acoustic output, documented on the EP ''[[The Troubled Troubador]]'', was heavily influenced by Williams. He recorded his own rewrites of [[Hank Williams, Jr.]]'s "Family Tradition" and [[David Allan Coe]]'s "Longhaired Redneck", calling his own versions "Scumfuc Tradition" and "Outlaw Scumfuc" respectively. Later, Allin also released another country album, ''[[Carnival of Excess: Limited Edition|Carnival of Excess]]'', his most refined record.

During this period, Allin collaborated with Bulge (also known as Psycho under a different name, on the album ''[[Freaks, Faggots, Drunks and Junkies]]''), The Aids Brigade (the 7" EP ''[[Expose Yourself to Kids]]'') and The Holymen (''[[You Give Love a Bad Name (album)|You Give Love a Bad Name]]''). Allin also began performing many [[spoken word]] pieces. Video footage of these are available but rare. Unwilling to seek steady employment, Allin supported himself by selling his own records. Allin was also [[murderabilia|fascinated with serial killers]]. He wrote to and visited [[John Wayne Gacy]] in prison a number of times and Gacy painted a portrait of Allin, which became the album cover to the soundtrack of the film ''[[Hated: GG Allin And The Murder Junkies]]''.

By this point, Allin's performances, which often resulted in considerable damage to venues and sound equipment, were regularly stopped after only a few songs by police or venue owners. Allin was charged with assault and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] or indecent exposure a number of times. His constant touring was only stopped by jail time or by long hospital stays for broken bones, blood poisoning, and other physical trauma.

Another attraction to Allin performances was his continual threats of suicide. In 1989, Allin wrote to ''Maximum RocknRoll'' stating that he would commit suicide on stage on Halloween 1989. However, he was in jail when that day came. He continued his threat each following year but ended up imprisoned each following Halloween. When asked why he did not follow through with his threats, Allin stated, "With GG, you don't get what you expect—you get what you deserve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killcreek.com/devolution/mykel/124.html |title=You're Wrong, No.&amp;nbsp;124 |publisher=Killcreek.com |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that suicide should only be done when one had reached his peak, meeting the afterlife at his strongest point and not at his weakest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/ekx001/MG/ANT1993MG.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050118083429/http://www.geocities.com/ekx001/MG/ANT1993MG.html |archivedate=January 18, 2005 |title=The GG Allin SuperSite Media Guide – Anthropomorphic No.&amp;nbsp;1 – January 1993 |publisher=Geocities.com |date=March 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1993, Allin made an appearance on ‘’[[The Jane Whitney Show]]’’. This interview is infamous for being his last interview and for Allin's aggression toward the audience. Allin openly stated that he would commit suicide and make the kids who supported him kill themselves as well. Allin also stated that he raped girls, men and animals that came to his concerts. A day after taping the show, Allin died in his last performance. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn4jd_Pc0T4]

===1989 trial and imprisonment===
In late 1989, Allin was arrested and charged with "assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder" of a female acquaintance in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].

In a psychological evaluation made as part of the trial, Allin was judged as having at least average intelligence, and was described as "courteous, cooperative and candid". The unnamed evaluator noted that Allin did not appear [[psychotic]], and seemed comfortable with his unorthodox lifestyle. However, the evaluator asserted Allin was dependent on alcohol and had a [[mixed personality disorder]] with [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]] and [[self-defeating personality disorder|masochistic]] features.

Allin initially denied the charges, claiming that the woman was a willing participant in their sexual activities. Allin admitted to cutting her, burning her, and drinking her blood, but insisted she did the same thing to him. Allin also claimed that inconsistencies in the woman's statements to authorities supported his assertions. The judge in the case agreed there were substantial inconsistencies in the woman's account. Ultimately, however, Allin plea bargained to the reduced charge of felonious assault, and he was imprisoned from December 25, 1989 to March 26, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecarouser.com/2014/08/31/he-was-your-enemy-part-ii/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919002052/http://thecarouser.com/2014/08/31/he-was-your-enemy-part-ii/ |archivedate=September 19, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this time in prison that Allin began feeling re-energized about his life and "mission". He wrote ''The GG Allin Manifesto''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=GG Allin ggallinonline.com |url=http://ggallinonline.com/mission.php |title=Text of the manifesto |publisher=Ggallinonline.com |date=October 31, 1990 |accessdate=February 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; during this period.

===''Hated'' documentary and final days===
{{main article|Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies}}
After his release from prison, Allin skipped parole to go on another tour, footage of which was shot for [[Todd Phillips]]'s documentary ''[[Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies]]''. The film contained graphic scenes from a performance Allin gave at the rock club Space at Chase in [[Manhattan]]'s [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. A heavily intoxicated Allin stripped naked, defecated on the floor, wiped his feces on himself and threw feces into the audience. He also threw beer bottles, breaking a woman's nose, and assaulted several other people in the crowd. Clips were included from other Allin appearances, as well as interviews with Allin, his band, and their fans. The film was released in 1994 and later followed on DVD in 1997.

In 1991, GG recorded what is widely regarded to be his masterpiece, an album entitled ''[[Murder Junkies]]'', released by New Rose Records, featuring [[Antiseen]] as his backing band. This album contained ten musical tracks and ten spoken-word pieces. Other than ''Freaks, Faggots, Drunks and Junkies'', Allin considered this album to be that which most accurately captured his persona and stated philosophy on life. It was also during this period that Allin recorded the album ''War in My Head – I'm Your Enemy'', released on [[Awareness Records]] and featuring the band Shrinkwrap. This particular album consists of one 45-minute track that is a [[sound collage|collage]] of spoken-word pieces which Shrinkwrap put to music.

Allin's growing notoriety led to appearances on various television shows: ''[[Geraldo (TV series)|Geraldo]]'', ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' and ''The Jane Whitney Show''. At the time of his death, Allin was making plans for a spoken-word album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Al Weisel |url=http://www.livefastdieyoungbook.com/spinggallin.htm |title=Al Weisel – Death of GG Allin |publisher=Livefastdieyoungbook.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127180133/http://www.livefastdieyoungbook.com/spinggallin.htm |archivedate=January 27, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned a somewhat unlikely European tour, enthusiastically talking about it in the hours before his death.&lt;ref name="freakparade.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scumfuc.narod.ru/story6.html|title=A Last Day in the Life of GG Allin|publisher=Freak Parade bassist Mike Bowling|accessdate=March 14, 2012|date=August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Family and relationships===
GG Allin married Sandra Farrow on October 6, 1980.&lt;ref name="arrest"&gt;Jesus Christ Allin page: "[http://jesus-christallin.tumblr.com/post/668299872/gg-allins-partial-arrest-record-on-his-death-report GG Allin's Partial Arrest Record on His Death Report]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}."&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 1986.&lt;ref name="arrest" /&gt;

In the mid-1980s, Allin became involved with a teenage girl from [[Garland, Texas]] named Tracy Deneault.&lt;ref name="arrest" /&gt; She became pregnant, and their daughter, Nico Ann Deneault, was born March 13, 1986.&lt;ref name="arrest" /&gt; Nico chose to distance herself from her family.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;interview with Arleta on ''The Best of the Murder Junkies'' DVD&lt;/ref&gt; Allin and Tracey Deneault never married.&lt;ref name="arrest" /&gt; At the time of his death, GG Allin's girlfriend was Liz Mankowski. They met when they appeared together (alongside Mankowski's sister and father) on ''The Jerry Springer Show''. They also appeared together on ''The Jane Whitney Show'', in 1993, with another Allin fan called Wendy.&lt;ref&gt;Youtube: GG Allin in America's Youth Gone Wild! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvKOW6UoiGQ 16:05&lt;/ref&gt; Mankowski was 17 when they met.&lt;ref&gt;Vice: Best Punk Moments in Talk Show History http://noisey.vice.com/blog/best-punk-moments-in-talk-show-history&lt;/ref&gt;

GG Allin had an older brother named [[Merle Allin]], who served as bassist for his last band, the Murder Junkies.

===Beliefs===
Allin was an extreme [[individualism|individualist]] and anti-authoritarian, promoting lawlessness and violence against police officers in many of his lyrics; his essay, ''The GG Allin Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ggallinarchives.com/gg-allin-murder-junkies-and-the-gg-allin-manifesto/|title=GG Allin Archives   -  The GG Allin Manifesto|website=ggallinarchives.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was intended to summarize his personal philosophy. He revealed on ''[[Geraldo (TV series)|Geraldo]]'' that he believed his body to be a temple of rock and roll, and that his flesh, blood, and bodily fluids were a communion to the people. Another reason given for his onstage antics (by Dino, the drummer of his band) was that he wanted to draw a parallel between his actions and "a society that's going crazy with violence". He has also said that if he was not a performer, he would probably be a [[serial killer]] or [[mass murderer]].&lt;ref name="hated" /&gt;

Regarding Allin's views on death, he believed in some form of an [[afterlife]]. He planned to kill himself onstage on [[Halloween]] many times in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but was stopped due to prison sentences around every Halloween each year. He explained his views on death in the film ''[[Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies]]'', stating: "It's like I've got this wild soul that just wants to get out of this life. It's too confined in this life. I think that to take yourself out at your peak... if you could die at your peak, your strongest point, then your soul will be that much stronger in the next existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = GG Allin – Hated: Special Edition |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9AvIpoV0ps |publisher = MVDmusicvideo |date = June 15, 2011 |accessdate = September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:GG Allin Grave.jpg|thumb|right|200px|GG Allin's grave in [[Littleton, New Hampshire]].]]
GG Allin's last show was on June 27, 1993 at a small club called The Gas Station, a punk venue located inside of a former gas station at 194 E 2nd Street in [[Manhattan]]. During the second song, the venue cut the power, after which he trashed the club, walked across the street naked, and then continued on (now wearing shorts, but still covered in blood and feces) through the neighborhood, followed by a large group of fans.

After walking the streets for almost an hour, Allin eventually went to his friend Johnny Puke's apartment. There, he and others continued to party and use drugs. Sometime during the evening, Allin ingested large amounts of heroin, on which he [[accidental overdose|accidentally overdosed]] and slipped into an unconscious state. Sometime in the early morning of June 28, Allin died from the effects of his heroin overdose. The next morning, some noticed that Allin still lay motionless in the same place where they had left him and called for an ambulance. Allin was pronounced dead at the scene. He was 36 years old.&lt;ref name="freakparade.org" /&gt;

===Funeral===
The funeral took place on July 3, 1993 in his native New Hampshire, at the St. Rose Cemetery, Littleton&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Disconnect|title=GG Allin's Funeral — "The Final Hellride" VHS, 1993 (Part 1)|date=2013-12-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX0zO0KX0v0|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At his funeral, Allin's bloated, unpreserved corpse was dressed in his black leather jacket and trademark jock strap. GG was buried with a bottle of [[Jim Beam]] beside him in his casket, as requested (openly stated in his self-penned acoustic country ballad, "When I Die"). As part of his brother's request, the mortician was instructed not to wash the corpse or apply any makeup.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Allin's funeral became a low-level party.&lt;ref&gt;GG Allin Archives: GG Allin's Funeral — The Final Hellride (VHS, 1993) http://ggallinarchives.com/gg-allins-funeral-the-final-hellride-vhs/&lt;/ref&gt; Friends posed with his corpse, placing drugs and whiskey into his mouth. As the funeral ended, his brother put a pair of headphones on Allin. The headphones were plugged into a portable cassette player, in which was loaded a copy of ''[[The Suicide Sessions]]''.

==Legacy==
Video footage of the soundcheck, concert, and aftermath from Allin's final concert on the day of his death was appended to the 1997 DVD release of ''Hated''.

GG Allin's grave was frequently vandalized with urine, cigarette butts, feces and alcohol by fans,&lt;ref&gt;''Littleton Courier'', June 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; an act that was greatly discouraged by GG's mother Arleta.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; His tombstone has since been removed because of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swampyacresfarm.com/GGAllinsGrave.html|title=Where is GG Allin's Grave?|publisher=|accessdate=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hank Williams III]]'s 2008 album ''[[Damn Right, Rebel Proud]]'' features the song "P.F.F.", which features the line "''This song is written and dedicated for GG Allin''" spoken at the beginning.

'''''Ha-Tsfira''''' ({{lang-he|הצפירה}}, "The Alarm"; also ''Ha-Tzefirah'') was a [[Hebrew language]] newspaper published in Poland 1862 and 1874–1931.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icon.crl.edu/detail.php?language=Hebrew&amp;country=&amp;title=&amp;oclcno=&amp;begindate=&amp;institution=&amp;sort=&amp;sortOrder=ASC&amp;item=-1&amp;recIndex=49&amp;recCount=70 ICON: International Coalition on Newspapers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Slonimski Chaim Zelig.jpg|thumb|180px|Chaim Selig Slonimski]]
The first issue of Ha-Tsfira appeared in [[Warsaw]], [[Congress Poland]], [[Russian Empire]] in 1862, edited by [[Chaim Selig Slonimski]] (known by his Hebrew acronym ḤaZaS). &lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/977814.html Spotlighting the 'great events' - Haaretz - Israel News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ha-Tsfira'' was the first Hebrew paper with an emphasis on the sciences. &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The paper closed down after six months when Slonimski became principal of the rabbinical seminary in [[Zhytomyr]] and the government began censorship of Hebrew books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=S&amp;artid=855 JewishEncyclopedia.com - SLONIMSKI, ḤAYYIM SELIG:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It reopened in 1874 in [[Berlin]]. 

In September 1875, it began to be published in Warsaw. Coverage of news and politics was introduced after the [[First Zionist Congress]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; From 1886, the paper began to appear as a daily. The driving spirit behind this change was Slonimski's assistant, [[Nachum Sokolov]], who was later appointed editor-in-chief.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Institute Anniversary Volume (1941-1961), Institute of Jewish Affairs, p.322&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ha-Tseira became part of a network of important Hebrew periodicals, among them [[Ha-Shahar]], [[He-Asif]], [[Ha-Shiloah]]. Some of the greatest names in early modern Hebrew literature published their work in the paper, including [[Mendele Mocher Sforim]], [[Y.L. Peretz]] and [[Sholem Aleichem]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

{{Confuse|Hegemon}}
'''Hegumen''', '''hegumenos''', or '''igumen''' ({{lang-el|ἡγούμενος}}, [[Transliteration|trans]]. {{grc-tr|ἡγούμενος}}) is the title for the head of a [[monastery]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], similar to the title of [[abbot]]. The head of a [[convent]] of [[nun]]s is called a '''hegumenia''' or '''ihumenia''' ({{lang-el|ἡγουμένη}}). The term means "the one who is in charge", "the leader" in Greek.

Initially the title was applied to the head of any monastery. After 1874, when the Russian monasteries were secularized and classified into three classes, the title of ''hegumen'' was reserved only for the lowest, third class. The head of a monastery of the second or first class holds the rank of [[archimandrite]]. In the [[Greek Catholic Church]], the head of all monasteries in a certain territory is called the ''protohegumen''.

The duties of both hegumen and archimandrite are the same, archimandrite being considered the senior dignity of the two. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] the title of Hegumen may be granted as an honorary title to any [[hieromonk]], even one who does not head a monastery.

[[Image:Solovki genealogy.jpg|thumb|200px|left|"Family Tree of the [[Solovetsky Monastery]]". A hand-drawn [[lubok]] listing the names of the monastery's hegumens (1870s).]]

A ruling hegumen is formally installed in a ceremony by the bishop, during which he is presented with his [[crozier|pastoral staff]] (Greek: ''paterissa'', Slavonic: палица, ''[[palitza]]''). Among the Russians, the pastoral staff for a Hegumen tends to be of wood (usually ebony), rather than metal. The hegumen is awarded the gold [[pectoral cross]] by the bishop, as for an [[archpriest]]. During divine services the hegumen wears a simple black monastic [[Mantle (vesture)|mantle]], while the higher ranking archimandrite wears a mantle similar to one worn by a bishop (though without the white "rivers" along the sides, and decorated with unadorned "tablets" at the neck and feet). An archimandrite also wears a [[Mitre#Eastern Christianity|mitre]] similar to one worn by a bishop; a hegumen does not (however, in the Russian tradition, a bishop may grant an hegumen the [[Privilege (canon law)|privilege]] of wearing the mitre as an ecclesiastical award). A hegumen may carry his pastoral staff in processions and when giving blessings in the church (though it is never carried into the sanctuary), although it usually stands upright next to his [[kathisma]] (monastic choir stall). When outside the church, a hegumen may use a wooden [[walking stick]] similar to that used by a bishop or archimandrite, only not adorned with a silver knob.

In the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] the rank is used in the capacity of an [[archpriest]] and actually is one. The name in the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is '''Kommos''', which is in turn a derivation of the [[Greek language|Greek]] '''Ighoumenos''' and this honorary title is granted to both married priests and hieromonks without distinction and is not used in the capacity of an Abbot, although the monasteries' abbots used to be Hegumen until the beginning of the 20th century, but by the mid century, the Church of Alexandria started to appoint [[Bishop]]s in the capacity of [[Abbot]]s. On the other hand, the rank of [[archimandrite]] fell into disuse in the Church of Alexandria from the late 16th century.

'''The International Foundation for Human Rights and Tolerance''' is a human rights group strongly affiliated with [[Scientology]], the stated aim of which is to "provide easy-to-understand human rights education to adults and children so that they are able to grasp what fundamental human rights are as aligned with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights."  The group's secondary objective is to "effectively combat violations of human rights, focusing on the issues of children and religious freedom."

The foundation, established in 1997 as the '''Foundation for Religious Tolerance''' at 1332 L. Ron Hubbard Way in Los Angeles, California, changed its name in 2002 and moved to 4845 Fountain Ave in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eri-nonprofit-salaries.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=NPO.Form990&amp;EIN=954035696&amp;Year=2004&amp;Cobrandid=0 | title = Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax | author = International Foundation for Human Rights and Tolerance | year = 1998–2004 | format = public documents | work = IRS Form 990 | publisher = Economic Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islamic''' decoration, which tends to avoid using [[figurative art|figurative]] images, makes frequent use of '''geometric patterns''' which have developed over the centuries.

The [[geometry|geometric]] designs in [[Islamic art]] are often built on combinations of repeated squares and circles, which may be overlapped and [[Islamic interlace patterns|interlaced]], as can [[arabesque]]s (with which they are often combined), to form intricate and complex patterns, including a wide variety of [[tessellation]]s. These may constitute the entire decoration, may form a framework for floral or [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphic]] embellishments, or may retreat into the background around other motifs. The complexity and variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and lozenges in the ninth century, through a variety of 6- to 13-point patterns by the 13th&amp;nbsp;century, and finally to include also 14- and 16-point stars in the sixteenth century.

Geometric patterns occur in a variety of forms in [[Islamic art]] and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]] including [[kilim]] carpets, [[Persia]]n [[girih]] and [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[zellige]] tilework, [[muqarnas]] decorative vaulting, [[jali]] pierced stone screens, [[ceramics]], leather, stained glass, woodwork, and metalwork.

Interest in Islamic geometric patterns is increasing in the West, both among craftsmen and artists including [[M. C. Escher]] in the twentieth century, and among [[mathematician]]s and [[physicist]]s including [[Peter J. Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt]] who controversially claimed in 2007 that tilings at the [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine in [[Isfahan]] could generate [[quasi-periodic]] patterns like [[Penrose tilings]].

== Background ==

===Islamic decoration===

[[Islamic art]] mostly avoids [[figurative art|figurative]] images to avoid becoming objects of worship.&lt;ref name=Bouaissa&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bouaissa|first1=Malikka|title=The crucial role of geometry in Islamic art|url=http://www.alartemag.be/en/en-art/the-crucial-role-of-geometry-in-islamic-art/|publisher=Al Arte Magazine|accessdate=1 December 2015|date=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Islamic [[geometry|geometric]] patterns derived from simpler designs used in earlier cultures: [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Sasanian]]. They are one of three forms of Islamic decoration, the others being the [[arabesque]] based on curving and branching plant forms, and [[Islamic calligraphy]]; all three are frequently used together.&lt;ref name=Heilbrunn&gt;{{cite web |title=Geometric Patterns in Islamic Art |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/geom/hd_geom.htm |website=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geometric designs and arabesques are forms of [[Islamic interlace patterns]].&lt;ref name=Hankin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hankin|first1=Ernest Hanbury|authorlink1=Ernest Hanbury Hankin|title=The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art. Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India No. 15|date=1925|publisher=Government of India Central Publication Branch|url=http://www.islamic-art.org/ArticlesOnline/BAViewPDF.asp?ArticleID=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose===

Authors such as [[Keith Critchlow]]{{efn|Critchlow is a professor of architecture, and the author of a book on Islamic patterns.}} argue that Islamic patterns are created to lead the viewer to an understanding of the underlying reality, rather than being mere decoration, as writers&lt;!-- such as the mosaic artist Robert Field--&gt; interested only in pattern sometimes imply.&lt;ref name=Critchlow&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Keith Critchlow |author=Critchlow, Keith |title=Islamic Patterns : an analytical and cosmological approach |publisher=Thames and Hudson |year=1976 |isbn=0-500-27071-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Field&gt;{{cite book |author=Field, Robert |title=Geometric Patterns from Islamic Art &amp; Architecture |publisher=Tarquin Publications |year=1998 |isbn=978-1-899618-22-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Wade{{efn|Wade is the author of a series of books on pattern in various artforms.}} states that "Much of the art of Islam, whether in architecture, ceramics, textiles or books, is the art of decoration – which is to say, of transformation." Wade argues that the aim is to transfigure, turning mosques "into lightness and pattern", while "the decorated pages of a Qur’an can become windows onto the infinite."&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wade |first1=David |title=The Evolution of Style |url=http://patterninislamicart.com/background-notes/the-evolution-of-style |website=Pattern in Islamic Art |accessdate=12 April 2016 |quote=Much of the art of Islam, whether in architecture, ceramics, textiles or books, is the art of decoration – which is to say, of transformation. The aim, however, is never merely to ornament, but rather to transfigure. ... The vast edifices of mosques are transformed into lightness and pattern; the decorated pages of a Qur’an can become windows onto the infinite. Perhaps most importantly, the Word, expressed in endless calligraphic variations, always conveys the impression that it is more enduring than the objects on which it is inscribed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against this, Doris Behrens-Abouseif{{efn|Behrens-Abouseif is a professor of the history of art and architecture at [[SOAS]].}} states in her book ''Beauty in Arabic Culture'' that a "major difference" between the philosophical thinking of Medieval Europe and the Islamic world is exactly that the concepts of the good and the beautiful are separated in Arabic culture. She argues that beauty, whether in poetry or in the visual arts, was enjoyed "for its own sake, without commitment to religious or moral criteria".&lt;ref name=Behrens-Abouseif&gt;{{cite book |last1=Behrens-Abouseif |first1=Doris |title=Beauty in Arabic Culture |date=1999 |publisher=Markus Wiener |isbn=978-1-558-76199-5 |pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|Mathematics and art|Girih}}

Many Islamic designs are built on squares and circles, typically repeated, overlapped and interlaced to form intricate and complex patterns.&lt;ref name=Heilbrunn/&gt; A recurring motif is the 8-pointed star, often seen in Islamic tilework; it is made of two squares, one rotated 45 degrees with respect to the other. The fourth basic shape is the [[polygon]], including [[pentagon]]s and [[octagon]]s. All of these can be combined and reworked to form complicated patterns with a variety of [[symmetry|symmetries]] including reflections and rotations. Such patterns can be seen as mathematical [[tessellation]]s, which can extend indefinitely and thus suggest [[infinity]].&lt;ref name=Heilbrunn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hussain&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hussain |first1=Zarah |title=Introduction to Islamic art |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/art/art_1.shtml |publisher=BBC |accessdate=1 December 2015 |date=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are constructed on grids that require only [[ruler]] and [[Compass (drawing tool)|compass]] to draw.&lt;ref name=Bellos&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bellos |first1=Alex |last2=Broug (Illustrator) |first2=Eric |title=Muslim rule and compass: the magic of Islamic geometric design |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/feb/10/muslim-rule-and-compass-the-magic-of-islamic-geometric-design |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=1 December 2015 |date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artist and educator [[Roman Verostko]] argues that such constructions are in effect [[algorithm]]s, making Islamic geometric patterns forerunners of modern [[algorithmic art]].&lt;ref name=Verostko&gt;{{cite web |last1=Verostko |first1=Roman |title=Algorithmic Art |url=http://www.verostko.com/algorithm.html |date=1999 |origyear=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circle symbolizes unity and diversity in nature, and many Islamic patterns are drawn starting with a circle.&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{cite web |last1=Henry |first1=Richard |title=Geometry – The Language of Symmetry in Islamic Art |url=http://artofislamicpattern.com/resources/educational-posters/ |website=Art of Islamic Pattern |accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the decoration of the 15th-century mosque in [[Yazd]], Persia is based on a circle, divided into six by six circles drawn around it, all touching at its centre and each touching its two neighbours' centres to form a regular hexagon. On this basis is constructed a six-pointed star surrounded by six smaller irregular hexagons to form a tessellating star pattern. This forms the basic design which is outlined in white on the wall of the mosque. That design, however, is overlaid with an intersecting tracery in blue around tiles of other colours, forming an elaborate pattern that partially conceals the original and underlying design.&lt;ref name=Henry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lockerbie&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lockerbie |first1=John |title=Islamic Design: Arabic / Islamic geometry 01 |url=http://www.catnaps.org/islamic/geometry.html#ribbon |website=Catnaps.org |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar design forms the logo of the Mohammed Ali Research Center.&lt;ref name=MOHA&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic Art and Geometric Design |url=http://www.moha.center/index.php/news-moha-en/209-moha-logo-design-en# |publisher=MOHA |accessdate=3 December 2015 |date=2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203133727/http://www.moha.center/index.php/news-moha-en/209-moha-logo-design-en |archivedate=3 December 2015}} The logo's construction is demonstrated in an animation on the MOHA website.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the early Western students of Islamic patterns, [[Ernest Hanbury Hankin]], defined a "geometrical arabesque" as a pattern formed "with the help of construction lines consisting of polygons in contact."&lt;ref name=Hankin/&gt; He observed that many different combinations of polygons can be used as long as the residual spaces between the polygons are reasonably symmetrical. For example, a grid of octagons in contact has squares (of the same side as the octagons) as the residual spaces. Every octagon is the basis for an 8-point star, as seen at [[Tomb of Akbar the Great|Akbar's tomb, Sikandra]] (1605–1613). Hankin considered the "skill of the Arabian artists in discovering suitable combinations of polygons .. almost astounding."&lt;ref name=Hankin/&gt; He further records that if a star occurs in a corner, exactly one quarter of it should be shown; if along an edge, exactly one half of it.&lt;ref name=Hankin/&gt;

== Evolution ==

=== Early stage ===

The earliest geometrical forms in Islamic art were occasional isolated geometric shapes such as 8-pointed stars and lozenges containing squares. These date from 836 in the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]], Tunisia, and since then have spread all across the Islamic world.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Abdullahi, Yahya |author2=Bin Embi, Mohamed Rashid |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095263513000216 |title=Evolution of Islamic geometric patterns |journal=Frontiers of Architectural Research |year=2013 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=243–251 |doi=10.1016/j.foar.2013.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle stage ===
[[File:Turkey, Konya - Alaeddin Mosque 03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Middle stage patterns on geometric borders around a [[Mihrab]] in the [[Alâeddin Mosque]], [[Konya]], [[Turkey]]. 1220 onwards|alt=Middle stage Islamic patterns]]

The next development, marking the middle stage of Islamic geometric pattern usage, was of 6- and 8-point stars, which appear in 879 at the Ibn Tulun Mosque, Cairo, and then became widespread.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi/&gt;

A wider variety of patterns were used from the 11th&amp;nbsp;century. Abstract 6- and 8-point shapes appear in the Tower of Kharaqan at [[Qazvin]], Persia in 1067, and the Al-Juyushi Mosque, Egypt in 1085, again becoming widespread from there, though 6-point patterns are rare in Turkey.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi/&gt;

In 1086, 7- and 10-point girih patterns (with heptagons, 5- and 6-pointed stars, triangles and irregular hexagons) appear in the [[Jameh Mosque of Isfahan]]. 10-point girih became widespread in the Islamic world, except in the Spanish [[Al-Andalus]].&lt;ref name=Abdullahi/&gt; Soon afterwards, sweeping 9-, 11-, and 13-point girih patterns were used in the [[Barsian mosque and minaret|Barsian Mosque]], also in Persia, in 1098; these, like 7-point geometrical patterns, are rarely used outside Persia and central Asia.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi/&gt;

Finally, marking the end of the middle stage, 8- and 12-point girih rosette patterns appear in the [[Alâeddin Mosque]] at [[Konya]], Turkey in 1220, and in the [[Abbasid]] palace in [[Baghdad]] in 1230, going on to become widespread across the Islamic world.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi/&gt;

=== Late stage ===
[[File:Mihrab at Jama Masjid, Fatehpur Sikri.jpg|thumb|upright|Late stage: geometric, vegetal, and calligraphic patterns around the Mihrab at the [[Jama Masjid, Fatehpur Sikri]]. 1571-5|alt=Elaborate late stage Islamic woodwork]]

The beginning of the late stage is marked by the use of simple 16-point patterns at the Hasan Sadaqah mausoleum in Cairo in 1321, and in the Alhambra in Spain in 1338–1390. These patterns are rarely found outside these two regions. More elaborate combined 16-point geometrical patterns are found in the Sultan Hasan complex in Cairo in 1363, but rarely elsewhere. Finally, 14-point patterns appear in the [[Jama Masjid, Fatehpur Sikri|Jama Masjid]] at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in [[India]] in 1571–1596, but in few other places.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi/&gt;{{efn|One such place is the Mustansiriyya Madrasa in Baghdad, as illustrated by Broug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Design |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-500-51695-9 |page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Artforms ==
Several artforms in different parts of the Islamic world make use of geometric patterns. These include
ceramics,&lt;ref name=MWNFceramics/&gt;
girih strapwork,&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt;
jali pierced stone screens,&lt;ref name=MetJali/&gt;
kilim rugs,&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;
leather,&lt;ref name=MWNFleather/&gt;
metalwork,&lt;ref name=Gibb1954/&gt;
muqarnas vaulting,&lt;ref name=Tabbaa/&gt;
shakaba stained glass,&lt;ref name=King/&gt;
woodwork,&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt; and
zellige tiling.&lt;ref name=Njoku/&gt;

=== Ceramics ===
{{further information|Islamic pottery}}

Ceramics lend themselves to circular motifs, whether radial or tangential. Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower petals, while circular bands can run around a bowl or jug. Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the [[Ayyubid]] period, 13th&amp;nbsp;century. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 petals lend themselves to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited to the shape of the vessel they were making.&lt;ref name=MWNFceramics&gt;{{cite web |title=Geometric Decoration and the Art of the Book.

=== Girih tilings and woodwork ===
{{Main article|Girih}}

Girih are elaborate [[Islamic interlace patterns|interlacing patterns]] formed of five standardized shapes. The style is used in [[Iranian architecture|Persian Islamic architecture]] and also in decorative woodwork.&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt; Girih designs are traditionally made in different media including cut brickwork, [[stucco]], and mosaic [[faience]] tilework. In woodwork, especially in the [[Safavid]] period, it could be applied either as lattice frames, left plain or inset with panels such as of coloured glass; or as mosaic panels used to decorate walls and ceilings, whether sacred or secular. In architecture, girih forms decorative interlaced strapwork surfaces from the 15th&amp;nbsp;century to the 20th&amp;nbsp;century. Most designs are based on a partially hidden geometric grid which provides a regular array of points; this is made into a pattern using 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotational symmetries which can fill the plane. The visible pattern superimposed on the grid is also geometric, with 6-, 8-, 10- and 12-pointed stars and a variety of convex polygons, joined by straps which typically seem to weave over and under each other.&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gereh-Sazi|url=http://english.tebyan.net/newindex.aspx?pid=177143|publisher=Tebyan|accessdate=4 December 2015|date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The visible pattern does not coincide with the underlying construction lines of the tiling.&lt;ref name=Iranica&gt;{{cite web |title=Gereh-Sāzī |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gereh-sazi |publisher=Encyclopaedia Iranica |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visible patterns and the underlying tiling represent a bridge linking the invisible to the visible, which is analogous to the "epistemological quest" ''', the search for the nature of the knowledge'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hooman|first=Koliji|date=30 March 2016|title=Gazing Geometries: Modes of Design Thinking in Pre-Modern Central Asia and Persian Architecture|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00004-016-0288-6|journal=Nexus Network Journal|volume=|pages=16|via=SpringerLink}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''.'''{{Clear}}

=== Jali ===

{{Main article|Jali}}

Jali are pierced stone screens with regularly repeating patterns. They are characteristic of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]], for example in the [[Mughal dynasty]] buildings at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] and the [[Taj Mahal]]. The geometric designs combine polygons such as octagons and pentagons with other shapes such as 5- and 8-pointed stars. The patterns emphasized symmetries and suggested infinity by repetition. Jali functioned as windows or room dividers, providing privacy but allowing in air and light.&lt;ref name=MetJali&gt;{{cite web |title=For Educators: Geometric Design in Islamic Art: Image 15 |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/learn/for-educators/publications-for-educators/art-of-the-islamic-world/unit-three/featured-works-of-art/image-15 |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jali forms a prominent element of the architecture of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=i&lt;!--sic--&gt;ntypes. p&lt;!--sic--&gt;erforate |url=https://intypes.cornell.edu/expanded.cfm?erID=107 |publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of perforated walls has declined with modern building standards and the need for security.

=== Kilim ===
{{Main article|Kilim}}
[[File:Wolf's Mouth Kilim Motif.jpg|thumb|upright|Somewhat [[kilim motifs|geometric motifs]] such as the [[Wolf]]'s Mouth (Kurt Aǧzi), to protect the flocks against wolves, are often woven into tribal [[kilim]]s.]]

A kilim is an Islamic&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Muhammad |last2=Begum|first2=Nasima |title=Islamic Textile Art and how it is Misunderstood in the West – Our Personal Views |url=http://www.turkotek.com/salon_00101/salon.html |publisher=Salon du Tapis d'Orient |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; flatwoven carpet (without a pile), whether for household use or a [[prayer mat]]. The pattern is made by winding the [[weft]] threads back over the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges.&lt;ref name=Lockerbie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CARPETS v. Flat-woven carpets: Techniques and structures |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/carpets-v |publisher=[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]] |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turkish Kilim Rug |url=http://www.rugs-oriental.net/turkish-kilim-rug.html |website=Through the Collector's Eye |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kilim motifs]] are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from [[wolf|wolves]].&lt;ref name=Erbek&gt;{{cite book |author=Erbek, Güran |title=Kilim Catalogue No. 1 |publisher =May Selçuk A. S. Edition=1st |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leather ===

Islamic leather is often embossed with patterns similar to those already described. Leather book covers, starting with the [[Quran]] where figurative artwork was excluded, were decorated with a combination of kufic script, medallions and geometric patterns, typically bordered by geometric [[braid]]ing.&lt;ref name=MWNFleather&gt;{{cite web |title=Geometric Decoration and the Art of the Book. Leather |url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/exhibitions/ISL/geometric/exhibition.php?theme=4  |publisher=Museum with no Frontiers |accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metalwork ===
Metal artefacts share the same geometric designs that are used in other forms of Islamic art. However, in the view of [[Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|Hamilton Gibb]], the emphasis differs: geometric patterns tend to be used for borders, and if they are in the main decorative area they are most often used in combination with other motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal motifs, or calligraphic script. Geometric designs in Islamic metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other motifs, or they can form the background pattern.&lt;ref name=Gibb1954&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibb |first=Sir Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen |authorlink=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb |title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JY3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA991 |year=1954 |publisher=Brill Archive|pages=990–992 |id=GGKEY:N71HHP1UY5E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even where metal objects such as bowls and dishes do not seem to have geometric decoration, still the designs, such as arabesques, are often set in octagonal compartments or arranged in concentric bands around the object. Both closed designs (which do not repeat) and open or repetitive patterns are used. Patterns such as interlaced six-pointed stars were especially popular from the 12th&amp;nbsp;century. Eva Baer{{efn|Baer is Emeritus Professor of Islamic Studies at Tel Aviv University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baer |first1=Eva |title=Ayyubid Metalwork With Christian Images |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IZ7ZIpb-TAgC&amp;redir_esc=y |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} notes that while this design was essentially simple, it was elaborated by metalworkers into intricate patterns interlaced with arabesques, sometimes organised around further basic Islamic patterns, such as the hexagonal pattern of six overlapping circles.&lt;ref name=Baer1983&gt;{{cite book |last=Baer |first=Eva |title=Metalwork in Medieval Islamic Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s__yi4pD-VEC&amp;pg=PA122 |year=1983 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-87395-602-4 |pages=122–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muqarnas ===

{{Main article|Muqarnas}}

Muqarnas are elaborately carved ceilings to [[semi-dome]]s, often used in mosques. They are typically made of stucco (and thus do not have a structural function), but can also be of wood, brick, and stone. They are characteristic of Islamic architecture of the Middle Ages from Spain and Morocco in the west to Persia in the east. Architecturally they form multiple tiers of [[squinch]]es, diminishing in size as they rise. They are often elaborately decorated.&lt;ref name=Tabbaa&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tabbaa |first1=Yasser |title=The Muqarnas Dome: Its Origin and Meaning |url=http://archnet.org/system/publications/contents/4158/original/DPT0869.pdf?1384781045 |website=Archnet |pages=61–74 |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stained glass ===
{{Main article|Shabaka (window)}}

Geometrically patterned [[stained glass]] is used in a variety of settings in Islamic architecture. It is found in the surviving summer residence of the [[Palace of Shaki Khans]], [[Azerbaijan]], constructed in 1797. Patterns in the [[Shabaka (window)|"shabaka" windows]] include 6-, 8-, and 12-point stars. These wood-framed decorative windows are distinctive features of the palace's architecture. Shabaka are still constructed the traditional way in [[Sheki, Azerbaijan|Sheki]] in the 21st&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=King&gt;{{cite book |author=King, David C.

=== Zellige ===
{{Main article|Zellige}}

Zellige are glazed terracotta tiles set into plaster, forming colourful mosaic patterns including regular and semiregular [[tessellation]]s. The tradition is characteristic of [[Morocco]], but is also found in Moorish Spain. Zellige is used to decorate mosques, public buildings and wealthy private houses.&lt;ref name=Njoku&gt;{{cite book |last=Njoku |first=Raphael Chijioke |title=Culture and Customs of Morocco |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRV1ZTDoSsUC&amp;pg=PA58 |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-33289-0 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kharaghan.jpg|thumb|Tomb towers of two [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] princes at Kharaghan, [[Qazvin province]], Iran, covered with many different brick patterns like those that inspired Ahmad Rafsanjani to create [[auxetic]] materials]]

In 2016, Ahmad Rafsanjani described the use of Islamic geometric patterns from tomb towers in Iran to create [[auxetic]] materials from perforated rubber sheets. These are stable in either a contracted or an expanded state, and can switch between the two, which might be useful for surgical [[stent]]s or for spacecraft components. When a conventional material is stretched along one axis, it contracts along other axes (at right angles to the stretch). But auxetic materials expand at right angles to the pull. The internal structure that enables this unusual behaviour is inspired by two of the 70 Islamic patterns that Rafsanjani noted on the tomb towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Webb |first1=Jonathan |title=Islamic art inspires stretchy, switchable materials |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35818924 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=16 March 2016 |date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Mathias Haffert''' ({{where|date=September 2012}} 23 August 1915 – {{where|date=September 2012}} 31 October 2001) was an American Roman Catholic author and editor. He wrote several books, mostly on Roman Catholic themes, co-founded Catholic societies, edited Catholic magazines and lectured on Catholic issues.

==Biography==
Haffert received his high school and college education at Mt. Carmel College, a Carmelite seminary, and then began his career as an author and lecturer.  Haffert was the co-founder of the [[Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima]], a [[Roman Catholic Marian Society]] which was approved by [[Pope Pius XII]] and has about 25 million members worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;John Haffert, 1982 ''Dear Bishop, the History of the Blue Army'' AMI Press {{ISBN|0-911988-42-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haffert was assisted in the creation and Daily operations of Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima by Father [[Venard Poslusney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://valtorta.alphalink.com.au/POEM.HTM That Wonderful Poem]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the editor of "Scapular Magazine" which helped enroll one million Americans in the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima and in prayer for the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Lederhendler, 2006 ''Jews, Catholics, and the Burden of History'' Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-530491-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haffert was a strong advocate of the message of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] and he worked with Fatima visionary Sister [[Lucia dos Santos]] to develop the "Fatima Pledge" in 1946. This later became the "Blue Army Pledge", in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twoheartsdesign.com/jmh_obit.html On John Haffert's Life]&lt;/ref&gt;  Haffert spoke often on topics concerning the [[Miracle of the Sun]].  One of Haffert's books, "That Wonderful Poem", endorses The [[Poem of the Man God]] by [[Maria Valtorta]], in which he explains how the Bishop of Fatima introduced him to these writings.

Haffert died at 86 in the United States.

'''Kaikalas''' are a [[Telugu language|Telugu]]-speaking [[weaving]] [[Caste system in India|caste]]. Kaikalas live in the [[Coastal Andhra]] and [[Rayalaseema]] regions of the [[South India]]n state of [[Andhra Pradesh]].They are classified as [[Other Backward Class]] (OBC) by the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncbc.nic.in/User_Panel/GazetteResolution.aspx?Value=mPICjsL1aLvYBtdZSrP4uO+ploAhiJHMitEMCkgxxsH/7oa9L5Zf2o2HH3BmrgcE|title=National Commission for Backward Classes|last=No.|first=47- Kaikala|date=|website=www.ncbc.nic.in|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known as ''Karikala Bhaktulu, Kykala.''

The community is divided into sects based on [[Sampradaya]] as [[Shaiva]]s and [[Vaishnava]]s. While the Shaivas give preference to worshipping [[Shiva]], the Vaishnavas give preference to worshipping [[Vishnu]].

The Kaikalas form a very important part of the ''Thathayagunta Gangamma Jatara'', the annual folk festival held at [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/Various-hues-mark-Ganga-Jatara/article15220634.ece|title=Various hues mark Ganga Jatara|date=2008-05-12|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kanji Panth''' or "Pure Terapanth" is a Universal stream of [[Digambara]], a [[Jain schools and branches|school of Jainism]] that posits that the discriminative knowledge between the "true pure knowledge self" and "the other" is the true and the only procedure of self-realization and the path of [[Moksha_(Jainism)|liberation]] where definitions of "true pure knowledge self" and "the other" is as originally practiced and described in [[Samaysara]] (Essence of Self), [[Pravachanasara]] (Essence of Doctrine) and [[Pancastikayasara]] (The five cosmic constituents) and their commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/jainism/index.html|title=Jainism|website=Philtar.ac.uk|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/jainism/kanji.html|title=Kanji Svami Panth|website=Philtar.ac.uk|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isjs.in/sites/all/themes/school/images/jain_in_india_a_d_Abroad.pdf|title=Kanji Svami Panth|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/kanji.html|title= Kanji Swami Panth}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also quote [[Amritchandra]] for their support: "In this world, only those are liberated who have understood the 'art of discriminative knowledge'; In this world, only those are in bondage who do not know the 'art of discriminative knowledge'".

The Digambara Jain scholar Kundakunda, in his ''Pravacanasara'' states that a Jain mendicant should meditate on "I, the pure self". Anyone who considers his body or possessions as "I am this, this is mine" is on the wrong road, while one who meditates, thinking the antithesis and "I am not others, they are not mine, I am one knowledge" is on the right road to meditating on the "soul, the pure self".{{sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=137–143}}{{Citation not found}} This meditative focus contrasts with the [[anatta]] focus of Buddhism, and the [[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]] focus in various [[vedanta]] schools of Hinduism such as the [[advaita]] and [[vishistadvaita]] schools.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993| pp=74, 102, Part I: 1–3, 10–11, 24, Part II: 20–28}}{{Citation not found}}{{sfn|Mahony|1997|pp= 171-177, 222}}{{Citation not found}}

==Philosophy==
A special stress is placed on "pure real perspective"(Nishchay Naya), [[predeterminism]], compatibility of [[predeterminism]] and [[free will]], and "knowledge of self". The scripture of [[Samayasara]] is given the highest status as this book describes path to liberation from "pure real perspective" in contrast to [[Tattvartha Sutra]] that describes the same subject matter and has approximately same chapters, but from a different point of view. [[Gatha]] 1, Gatha 8, Gatha 11, Gatha 13, Gatha 38, Gatha 73, Gatha 320 and Gatha 412 of [[Samayasara]] and Gatha 80, Gatha 114 and Gatha 172 of [[Pravachanasara]] are considered particularly important because they include techniques of realizing pure self. Commentaries by [[Amritchandra]] on Samaysaara and Pravachansara is also given utmost importance and is considered an integral part of the book. They often site this statement from [[Einstein]] in support of their philosophy: "Events do not happen. They already exist and are seen on the Time Machine.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kanjiswami.org/uploads/media/PDF/012%20Extra%20HI/Old/Varsh-36/GU_1980_05.pdf|title=Reference to Predetermination|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanji Panth philosophy is similar to that of the Digambara Terapanth denomination in the lineage of [[Pandit Todarmal]], [[Banarasidas]], Rajmal, Deepchand Kasliwal and Shitalprasad which was largely extinct when Kanji Swami arrived on the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.jain.org/4.books/Articles/TodarMalSmarakVisangatiyan.pdf|page=13|title=extinction of terapanthi digambar in 1950-60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Followers also believe that Kanji Swami, [[Champaben]] and Shantaben were present when [[Kundakunda]] visited to listen to the [[Tirthankara]] [[Simandhara|Simandhara Swami]] in Mahavideha as remembered by [[Champaben]]. After this, Kundakunda wrote his [[Pravachanasara|''Essence of the Doctrine'']]. Another tenet is that after Kanji Swami's death, he would be reborn as Tirthankara Suryakirti in the continent of Dhatakikhanda with [[Champaben]] and Shantaben born as their sons (Devkirti and Chandrakirti) and [[Ganadhara]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==History==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2018}}
Kanji Swami was a swetambara monk. He read all the swetambara books with utmost sincerity and followed all the conduct strictly, but somehow felt that it doesn't describe real path to liberation. One day, he was given [[Samayasara]], the Digambara Jain bible, by one of his followers. Reading [[Samayasara]], Kanji Swami immediately recognized and realized the real path of liberation that was described in the book clearly and unambiguously. He started preaching the message of Samaysara while still retaining swetambara monkhood. But, he was not particularly happy with this contradiction of reading Digambara text while retaining swetambara monkhood. Eventually, Kanji Swami left swetambara jainism and converted to digambara jainism. Most of his Swetambara followers also followed him. Soon, hundreds of new digambara temples were built in the region of Saurashtra. Samaysaara, Pravachansaara and other digambar texts were translated in Gujarati and Hindi afresh and with correct interpretations. Millions of copies of [[Samaysara]] and [[Pravachanasara]] were sold all over the world. Slowly, original digambaras from other parts of India recognized the importance of [[Samayasara]] and joined Kanjiswami in his Adhyatmic movement.

==Conventions and rituals==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2018}}
Listening to audio or video recordings of Kanji Swami's and [[Champaben]]'s discourses in the mornings and evenings in the temple is the integral part of the daily routine. Followers are also encouraged to read and reflect the scriptures directly and listen to the discourses at home to realize the pure self as described in [[Samayasara]]. All the temples have a big Study Room, equipped with multimedia player and hard copies of [[Samaysara]] and [[Pravachanasara]] where followers gather to listen to the recordings of Kanji Swami.

The Digambar Jain temples of this lineage are identical to those of the [[Bispanthi]] sect except for the presence of a photograph and/or statue of Kanji Swami; a photograph of [[Champaben]], [[Srimad Rajchandra]], and Acharya [[Kundakunda]], and the absence of photographs of monks and aryikas of Bisapanthi sects. Some temples have [[Samayasāra]] / [[Pravachanasara]] written on the walls of the temple. Flowers, cooked food and milk are not used for Abhisheka / Pooja. Some temples have an idol of Kanji Swami in the form of the future [[Tirthankara]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In addition to celebrating usual Jain festivals of [[Das Lakshana]] , [[Mahavir Jayanti]] and Shruta Panchami; they celebrate birthdays and anniversary days of [[Kanji Swami]] and [[Champaben]] as well as [[Ratnatraya#Right Faith|Samyak]] Jayanti of [[Champaben]].

==Temples==
There is no centralized management of temples. All Temples are managed independently by a local board of trustees. Apart from numerous temples in India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmadharma.com/contacts.html|title=Jain Literature and Jain Logic: World-Wide Contacts|website=Atmadharma.com|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; temples exist in [[Brampton Jain Temple|Brampton]], Canada;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jaintemplecanada.com/index1.html|title=Bhagwan 1008 Adinatha Swamy Jain Temple|website=Jaintemplecanada.com|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harrow, London]], ;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdja.co.uk|title=Shree Digamber Jain Association|website=Sdja.co.uk|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mombasa]], Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jain24.com/jain-temples/mombasa-kenya/|title=Kanji Svami Digambar Jain Temple in Mombasa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - King Latinus in council (State 1).jpg|thumb|300px|Latinus in Council, print by [[Wenceslas Hollar]], 1607-1677]]
'''Latinus''' ({{lang-la|Lătīnŭs}}; {{lang-grc|Λατῖνος}}) was a figure in both [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]].  He is often associated with the heroes of the Trojan War, namely Odysseus and Aeneas.  Although his appearance in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' is irreconcilable with his appearance in [[Greek mythology]], the two pictures are not so different that he cannot be seen as one character.

==Greek mythology==
In [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Lines 1011–1016.&lt;/ref&gt; Latinus was the son of [[Odysseus]] and [[Circe]] who ruled the [[Tyrrhenians|Tyrsenoi]], presumably the [[Etruscans]], with his brothers [[Ardeas]] and [[Telegonus]]. Latinus is also referred to, by much later authors, as the son of [[Pandora II]] and brother of [[Graecus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/Zeus.html Parada, Carlos. ''Greek Mythology Link''. "Zeus" (1997).]&lt;/ref&gt; although according to Hesiod, Graecus had three brothers, [[Hellen]], Magnitas, and [[Macedon]], with the first being the father of [[Dorus|Doros]], [[Xuthus|Xuthos]], and [[Aeolus (son of Hellen)|Aeolus]].

==Roman mythology==
In later [[Roman mythology]] (notably [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''), Latinus, or Lavinius, was a king of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]]. He is sometimes described as the son of [[Faunus]] and [[Marica (mythology)|Marica]], and father of [[Lavinia]] with his wife, [[Amata]]. He hosted Aeneas's army of exiled [[Trojan War|Trojans]] and offered them the chance to reorganize their life in [[Latium]]. His wife Amata wished his daughter Lavinia to be betrothed to [[Turnus]], king of the [[Rutuli]], but Faunus and the gods insisted that he give her instead to [[Aeneas]]; consequently, Turnus declared war on Aeneas and was killed two weeks into the conflict. [[Ascanius]], the son of Aeneas, later founded [[Alba Longa]] and was the first in a long series of kings leading to [[Romulus]] and [[Remus]], the founders of [[Rome]].

This version is not compatible with the Greek one: the Trojan War had ended only eight years earlier, and Odysseus only met Circe a couple of months later, so any son of the pair could only be seven years old, whereas the Roman Latinus had an adult daughter by then.

The '''Lipovan Orthodox Old-Rite Church''' (or '''Orthodox Old-ritualist Church''', '''Orthodox Old-Rite Church''') is the Romanian-based jurisdiction of the [[Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy]].

The head of the Church carries the title of ''Archbishop of Belo-Krinitsa and Metropolitan of All Old Orthodox Christians''. His see is officially (not in fact) in [[Stary Vovchynets|Bila Krynytsya]] (Bukovina), his residence in [[Brăila]], [[Romania]] (current titular: Metropolitan [[Leontius (Izot)]] since 24 October 1996).

==History==

[[Lipovan]]s are Russian [[Old Believers]] who fled Russia in the late 17th early 18th centuries in order to escape the persecution of their faith.

== Eparchies ==

Four [[Eparchy|eparchies]] in Romania:

* Eparchy of [[Brăila]] and [[Tulcea]]
* Eparchy of [[Slava Rusă|Slava]]
* Eparchy of [[Bukovina]] and [[Moldavia]]
* Eparchy of North America, Western Europe, Australia, and Georgia of the former Soviet Union

Although some members of the new church soon returned to the Ditchling congregation, the cause thrived under Booker's leadership, and the present chapel—a building of "quiet and unassuming elegance"&lt;ref name="Homan265"&gt;{{Harvnb|Homan|1997|p=265.}}&lt;/ref&gt; set in its own graveyard—was erected in 1780.  It has served the Strict Baptist community continuously since then, and members founded other chapels elsewhere in Sussex during the 18th and 19th centuries.  [[English Heritage]] has [[Listed building|listed]] the building at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance.

==Other Strict Baptist churches==
The term Strict Baptist was used up until recent decades by other sizeable groups of Calvinistic Baptist churches in England that did not adhere to the Gospel Standard Articles or Magazine.  Many were members of regional Strict Baptist Associations,&lt;ref name="biblicalstudies.org.uk"/&gt; but from about 1980 onwards assemblies, regional associations, and charities connected with this movement gradually adopted the appellation "[[Grace Baptist]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gracebaptistassembly.org.uk/gba/index.php/about#&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agbcse.org.uk/history/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717070536/http://www.agbcse.org.uk/history/history.html |archivedate=2014-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gbtc.org.uk/whoweare.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Lists of churches can be found on the websites of the various regional Grace Baptist associations.

[[File:Imam Mahdi.png|thumb|262px|[[Islamic calligraphy|Calligraphic]] representation of the [[Names and titles of Muhammad|name of Muhammad al-Mahdi]] as it appears in the [[Masjid al-Nabawi|Prophet's Mosque]] in [[Medina]]]]

The '''Mahdi''' ({{lang-ar|ٱلْـمَـهْـدِي}}, [[ISO 233]]: ''{{transl|ar|ISO|al-mahdī}}'', literally "the guided one") is an [[Islamic eschatology|eschatological]] redeemer of [[Islam]] who will appear and rule for five, seven, nine or nineteen years (according to differing interpretations)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/33/75|title=Hadith - Chapters on Al-Fitan - Jami` at-Tirmidhi - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|last=|first=|date=|website=sunnah.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Muslim World 2004 p.421"&gt;Martin 2004: 421&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[Day of Judgment#Islam|Day of Judgment]] ({{transl|ar|''yawm al-qiyamah''}}, literally "the Day of Resurrection")&lt;ref name=Glasse/&gt; and will rid the world of evil.&lt;ref name=momen /&gt;

There is no direct reference to the Mahdi in the [[Quran]],&lt;ref name="EI2" /&gt; only in the ''a[[hadith]]'' (the reports and traditions of [[Muhammad]]'s teachings collected after his death). In most traditions, the Mahdi will arrive with [[Jesus in Islam|'Isa]] ([[Jesus]]) to defeat ''Al-[[Masih ad-Dajjal]]'' (literally "the false Messiah", or [[Antichrist]]).&lt;ref name="S209"&gt;Sonn (2004) p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Although the concept of a Mahdi is not an essential doctrine in [[Sunnism|Sunni Islam]], it is popular among both Sunni and [[Shia]] Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Shahzad Bashir ''Messianic Hopes and Mystical Visions: The Nūrbakhshīya Between Medieval and Modern Islam'' Univ of South Carolina Press 2003 {{ISBN|978-1-570-03495-4}} page 24&lt;/ref&gt; Both agree that he will rule over the Muslims and establish justice; however, they differ extensively on his attributes and status.

Throughout history, various individuals have claimed to be the Mahdi. These have included [[Muhammad Jaunpuri]], founder of the [[Mahdavia]] sect; the [[Báb]] (Siyyid Ali Muhammad), founder of [[Bábism]]; [[Muhammad Ahmad]], who established the [[Mahdist State]] in [[Sudan]] in the late 19th century; [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], founder of the [[Ahmadiyya]] religion; [[Massoud Rajavi|Massoud Rajavi,]] leader of the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|MEK]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/09/mek-iran-revolution-regime-trump-rajavi|title=Terrorists, cultists – or champions of Iranian democracy?

[[Twelver Shia]] believe the Mahdi is [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]].

==Historical development==
The term ''mahdi'' does not occur in the [[Quran]]. It is derived from the Arabic root ''h-d-y'' ({{lang-ar|هـدي}}), commonly used to mean "divine guidance". The term ''al-Mahdi'' was employed from the beginning of Islam, but only as an honorific epithet and without any messianic significance.&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | edition = 2nd| publisher = Brill Academic Publishers| volume = 5| pages = 1230–8| last = Madelung,| first = Wilferd | title = al-Mahdī| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]| date = 1986 | isbn = 90-04-09419-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an honorific it has been used in some instances to describe [[Muhammad]] (by [[Hassan ibn Thabit]]), as well as [[Abraham]], [[al-Hussain]], and various [[Umayyad]] rulers (''hudāt mahdiyyūn'').&lt;ref name="EI2" /&gt; During the [[Second Fitna|second civil war]] (680-692), after the death of [[Muʾawiya]], the term acquired a new meaning of a ruler who would restore Islam to its perfect form and restore justice after oppression.&lt;ref name="EI2" /&gt; In [[Kufa]] during the rebellion in 680s, [[Al-Mukhtar]] proclaimed [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah|Muhammad al-Hanafiyyah]] as the Mahdi in this heightened sense. Among the Umayyads, [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik|Sulayman]] encouraged the belief that he was the Mahdi, and other Umayyad rulers, like [[Umar II]], have been addressed as such in the [[panegyrics]] of [[Jarir (poet)|Jarir]] and [[al-Farazdaq]].&lt;ref name="EI2" /&gt;

Early discussions about the identity of al-Mahdi by religious scholars can be traced back to the time after the [[Second Fitna]]. These discussions developed in different directions and were influenced by traditions ([[hadith]]s) attributed to Muhammad. In Umayyad times, scholars and traditionists not only differed on which caliph or rebel leader should be designated as Mahdi, but also on whether the Mahdi is a messianic figure and if signs and predictions of his time have been satisfied.&lt;ref name="EI2" /&gt; By the time of the [[Abbasid Revolution]] in the year 750, Mahdi was already a known concept. Evidence shows that the first Abbasid caliph [[As-Saffah]] assumed the title of "the Mahdi" for himself.&lt;ref name="EI2" /&gt;

In [[Shia Islam]], it seems likely that the attribution of messianic qualities to the Mahdi originated from two of the groups supporting al-Hanafiyyah: [[South Arabian|southern Arabian]] settlers and local recent converts in [[Iraq]]. They became known as [[Kaysanites Shia|Kaysanites]], and introduced what later became two key aspects of the Shia's concept of the Mahdi. The first was the notion of return of the dead, particularly of the Imams. The second was that after al-Hanafiyyah's death they believed he was, in fact, in hiding in the Razwa mountains near [[Medina]]. This later developed into the doctrine known as [[the Occultation]].&lt;ref name="Arjomand 2007 134–136"/&gt; The Mahdi appeared in early [[Shia|Shi’ite]] narratives, spread widely among Shi’ite groups and became dissociated from its historical figure, Muhammad al-Hanafiyyah. During the 10th century, based on these earlier beliefs, the doctrine of Mahdism was extensively expanded by [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni|Al-Kulayni]], [[Ali ibn Ibrahim al-Qummi|Ibrahim al-Qummi]] and [[Ibn Babawayh]].&lt;ref name=etan /&gt; In particular, in the early 10th century, the doctrine of the Occultation, which declares that the Twelfth Imam did not die but was concealed by God from the eyes of men, was expounded. The Mahdi became synonymous with the "Hidden Imam" who was thought to be in occultation awaiting the time that God has ordered for his return. This return is envisaged as occurring shortly before the final Day of judgment.&lt;ref name=momen /&gt; In fact, the concept of the "hidden Imam" was attributed to several Imams in turn.&lt;ref name=corbin /&gt;

Some historians suggest that the term itself was probably introduced into Islam by southern Arabian tribes who had settled in [[Syria]] in the mid-7th century. They believed that the Mahdi would lead them back to their homeland and reestablish the [[Himyarite]] kingdom. They also believed that he would eventually conquer [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="Arjomand 2007 134–136"/&gt; It has also been suggested that the concept of the Mahdi may have been derived from messianic Judeo-Christian beliefs.&lt;ref name=etan/&gt;&lt;ref name=arjomand2 /&gt; Accordingly, traditions were introduced to support certain political interests, especially Anti-[[Abbassid]] sentiments.&lt;ref name=arjomand2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=reza /&gt; These traditions about the Mahdi appeared only at later times in hadith collections such as ''[[Jami' at-Tirmidhi]]'' and ''[[Sunan Abi Dawud]]'', but are absent from the early works of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim]].&lt;ref name=Glasse/&gt;

==Sunni Islam==
Since Sunnism has no established doctrine of Mahdi, compositions of Mahdi varies among Sunni scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Beom Rhee ''Asian Millenarianism: An Interdisciplinary Study of the Taiping and Tonghak Rebellions in a Global Context'' Cambria Press 2006 {{ISBN|978-1-934-04342-4}} page 230&lt;/ref&gt; While some scholars like [[Ibn Khaldun]] even disputed the authenticity of references concerning the Mahdi in [[hadith]] literature, others like [[Ibn Kathir]] elaborated a whole apocalyptic scenario which included prophecies about Mahdi, Jesus and Dajjal during the endtime.&lt;ref&gt;Oddbjørn Leirvik ''Images of Jesus Christ in Islam: 2nd Edition'' A&amp;C Black {{ISBN|978-1-441-18160-2}} page 41&lt;/ref&gt; Some Sunni beliefs deny the Mahdi as a separate figure, accordingly Jesus will fulfill this role and judge over mankind, thus ''Mahdi'' is considered as a title for Jesus, when he returns.&lt;ref&gt;John L. Esposito ''Oxford Dictionary of Islam'' Oxford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-195-12559-7}} page 75&lt;/ref&gt; However the more common opinion among Sunni Muslims is, that the Mahdi is an expected ruler sent by [[God in Islam|God]] before the endtime to reestablish righteousness,&lt;ref name="Arjomand 2007 134–136"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arjomand|first=Said Amir|title=Islam in Iran vi., the Concept of Mahdi in Sunni Islam|journal=Encyclopaedia Iranica|date=Dec 2007|volume=XIV|issue=Fasc. 2|pages=134–136|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/islam-in-iran-vi-the-concept-of-mahdi-in-sunni-islam}}&lt;/ref&gt; coincides with the [[Second Coming of Christ#Islam|Second Coming of Jesus Christ (''Isa'')]],&lt;ref name="S209"&gt;Sonn (2004) p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; but, unlike most Shia traditions, Sunni Islam often do not believe the Mahdi has already been born,&lt;ref name= religionfacts/&gt; but there is a group of Sunni famous scholars who mentioned that Mahdi has already been born, such as Al-Dhahabi, Ibn-Hajar, Abu al-Falah Hanbali, al-Qunduzi and so on; meanwhile, Sheikh Najm al-Din al-Askari in his book&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Sheikh Najm al-Din al-Askari, Al-Mahdi Al-Mawood Al-Montazar Enda (by) Ahl al-Sunnah, Vol. 1, P. 220&lt;/ref&gt; named 40 of Sunni scholars who mentioned that Mahdi has already been born.&lt;ref&gt;Shadharat al-dhahab (Beirut edition), Vol. 2, p. 141; al-'Ibar fi khabar min ghabar (Kuwait edition), Vol. 2, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://article.tebyan.net/155528/%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%85%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D8%AC- https://article.tebyan.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al-islam.org/al-imam-al-mahdi-just-leader-humanity-ayatullah-ibrahim-amini/chapter-5-who-was-imam-after-hasan-al#f_ab89352e_50 www.al-islam.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamquest.net/ar/archive/question/fa1708 www.islamquest.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Sunnis in general reject the [[Twelver]] Shi'ite principle of the Mahdi's occultation. Sunnis do, however, rely on traditionally canonical collections of narrations for derivations of the Mahdi's attributes and lineage. According to Sunan Abi Dawud, one of the six canonical books of Hadith in Sunni Islam, narrated by Umm Salamah, "The Prophet said: The Mahdi will be of my family, of the descendants of Fatimah." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/abudawud/38/6|title=Hadith - The Promised Deliverer (Kitab Al-Mahdi) - Sunan Abi Dawud - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|last=|first=|date=|website=sunnah.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In heavy contrast with Shia Islam, Sunnis have a much more human view of the Mahdi, who they believe will be nothing less than the most rightly guided Muslim of his time. He will be rectified in a single night (which is taken to mean that the provisions for his leadership and rule will be made in a single night). According to Sunan Ibn Majah, one of the six canonical collections of Hadith, narrated by 'Ali, "Mahdi is one of us, the people of the Household. Allah will rectify him in a single night."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/ibnmajah/36/160|title=Hadith - Book of Tribulations - Sunan Ibn Majah - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|last=|first=|date=|website=sunnah.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas much of the Shi'ite belief ascribes divine faculties—in some circles of Shi'ite Islam it is even believed that the Mahdi can mentally control the wind and vegetation by God's permission—and transcendent status to the Mahdi, Sunnis believe he will be altogether human but will have sagacity, especially as it pertains to leading other people and ruling a nation. Sunnis believe he will rise and be recognized by his continued philanthropy, charity, piety, facial features, name, and sense of justice, not through direct divine intervention. It is not unreasonable to suspect, based on these narrations, that the Mahdi may not be known to the people immediately, even after being born and living for quite some time without the title of Mahdi (hence, being rectified by God). According to [[Sunan Abu Dawood|Sunan Abi Dawud]], "The Prophet said: The Mahdi will be of my stock, and will have a broad forehead [and] a prominent nose. He will fill the earth with equity and justice as it was filled with oppression and tyranny, and he will rule for seven years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/abudawud/38/7|title=Hadith - The Promised Deliverer (Kitab Al-Mahdi) - Sunan Abi Dawud - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|website=sunnah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===References interpreted in ''ahadith''===
{{Primary sources|date=November 2017}}
The Mahdi is frequently mentioned in Sunni hadith as establishing the caliphate. Among Sunnis, some believe the Mahdi will be an ordinary man. The following Sunni hadith make references to the Mahdi:
* [[Muhammad]] is quoted as saying about the Mahdi: 
{{Quote|His name will be my name, and his father's name my father's name&lt;ref name="Arjomand 2007 134–136"/&gt;
}}

{{Quote|Even if the entire duration of the world's existence has already been exhausted and only one day is left before Doomsday, Allah will expand that day to such length of time as to accommodate the kingdom of a person from my Ahlul-Bayt who will be called by my name. He will fill out the earth with peace and justice as it will have been full of injustice and tyranny (by then).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jami` at-Tirmidhi|Sahih al-Tirmidhi]], v2, p86, v9, pp 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sunan Abu Dawood]], v2, p7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] v1, pp 84,376; V3, p63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Mustadrak alaa al-Sahihain]]by al-Hakim, v4, p557&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Jaami' al-Saghîr, by [[Al-Suyuti]], pp 2,160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;al-Urful Wardi, by [[Al-Suyuti]], p2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kanz al-Ummal]], v7 P186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sharh al-Mawahib al-Ladunniyyah]], by al-Zurqani, v5, p348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fat’h al-Mugheeth, by [[Al-Sakhawi]], v3, p41&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* [[Umm Salama Hind bint Abi Umayya|Umm Salama]], a wife of Muhammad, is quoted as saying that;
&lt;blockquote&gt;His [the Mahdi's] aim is to establish a moral system from which all superstitious faiths have been eliminated. In the same way that students enter Islam, so unbelievers will come to believe.&lt;ref&gt;(Vizier Mustafa, ''Emergence of Islam'', p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the Mahdi appears, Allah will cause such power of vision and hearing to be manifested in believers that the Mahdi will call to the whole world from where he is, with no [[postman]] involved, and they will hear and even see him.&lt;ref&gt;Muntakab al Adhhar, p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* [[Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri]] is quoted as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Messenger of Allah said: "He is one of us".&lt;ref&gt;Reported by bi Na’eem in ''Akhbaar al-Mahdi'', see al-Jaami’ ''al-Sagheer'', '''5''': 219, ''hadith'' 5796.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Messenger of Allah said: "The Mahdi is of my lineage. He will fill the earth with fairness and justice as it was filled with oppression and injustice, and he will rule for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunan Abi Dawud, Kitaab al-Mahdi'', '''11''': 375, ''hadith'' 4265; ''Mustadrak al-Haakim'', '''4''': 557; "he said: this is a saheeh hadeeth according to the conditions of Muslim, although it was not reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim". See also ''Sahih al-Jaami'', 6736''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Messenger of Allah said: "At the end of the time of my ummah, the Mahdi will appear. Allah will grant him rain, the earth will bring forth its fruits, he will give a lot of money, cattle will increase and the ummah will become great. He will rule for seven or eight years.&lt;ref&gt;''Mustadrak al-Hakim,'' '''4''': 557-558; "he said: this is a hadith whose isnaad is sahih, although it was not reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him, and al-Albaani said: this is a saheeh sanad, and its men are thiqaat (trustworthy), Silsilat al-ahaadeeth al-saheehah," '''2''': 336, ''hadeeth'' 771.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* At-Tirmidhi reported that Muhammad said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Mahdi is from my [[Ummah]]; he will be born and live to rule five or seven or nine years. (If) one goes to him and says, "Give me (a charity)", he will fill one's garment with what one needs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* At-Tirmidhi reported that Muhammad said: &lt;blockquote&gt;The face of the Mahdi shall shine upon the surface of the Moon.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* [[Al-Tabarani|At-Tabarani]] reported that: &lt;blockquote&gt;His forehead will be broad and his nose will be high, his face will shine like a star and he will have a black spot on his left cheek.&lt;ref&gt;Tabarani&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Amr bin Shuaib reported from his grandfather that the Messenger of Allah said: &lt;blockquote&gt;In [[Dhu al-Qi'dah]] (Islamic month), there will be fight among the tribes, [[Hajji|Muslim pilgrims]] will be looted and there will be a battle in [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]] in which many people will be slain and blood will flow until it runs over the [[Stoning of the Devil|Jamaratul Aqba]] (one of the three stone pillars at Mina). The man they seek will flee and will be found between the Rukn (a corner of the [[Kaaba]] containing the [[Black Stone]]) and the [[Petrosomatoglyph#Abraham|Maqam of Prophet Abraham]] (near Ka'ba). He will be forced to accept people's [[Bay'ah]] (being chosen as a Leader/Caliph). The number of those offering Bay'ah will be the same as the number of the people of Badr (Muslim fighters who participated in the [[Battle of Badr]] at time of Prophet Mohammad). Then, the dweller of Heaven and the dweller of the Earth will be pleased with him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Naeem Bin Hammad]]'s book Kitab Al-Fitan (8584\503\4) أخرج ( ك ) نعيم بن حماد (986), والحاكم&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Modern views===
A typical modernist in his views on the Mahdi, [[Abul Ala Maududi]] (1903–1979), the [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] [[Islamic revival]]ist, stated that the Mahdi will be a modern Islamic reformer/statesman, who will unite the [[Ummah]] and revolutionise the world according to the ideology of Islam, but will never claim to be the Mahdi, instead receiving posthumous recognition as such.&lt;ref&gt;Syed Maududi, ‘’Tajdeed-o-Ahyaa-e-Deen’’, Islamic Publications Limited, Lahore, Pakistan, Chapeter: Imam Mehdi&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Islamic scholars reject Mahdi doctrine, including Allama Tamanna Imadi (1888–1972),&lt;ref&gt;Allama Tamanna Imadi, ‘’Intizar-e-Mehdi-o-Maseeh’’, Al-Rahman Publishing Trust, Karachi, Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allama Habibur Rahman Kandhalvi]],&lt;ref&gt;Allama Habib-ur-Rahman Kandhlwi, ''Mehdaviyyat nay Islam ko Kiya Diya’’, Anjuman Uswa-e-Hasna, Karachi, Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]] (1951- ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-mawrid.org/pages/articles_english_detail.php?rid=455&amp;cid=263&amp;search=mahdi |title=Al-Mawrid |publisher=Al-Mawrid |date=25 September 2009 |accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Allama Iqbal, ‘’Iqbal Nama, Volume 2’’, Bazm-e-Iqbal, Lahore, Pakistan, Letter No. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Javed Ahmad Ghamidi writes in his book ''Mizan'': &lt;blockquote&gt;Besides these, the coming of the Mahdi and that of Jesus from the heavens are also regarded as signs of the Day of Judgment. I have not mentioned them. The reason is that the narratives of the coming of the Mahdi do not conform to the standards of ''hadith'' criticism set forth by the ''[[muhaddith]]un''. Some of them are weak and some fabricated; no doubt, some narratives, which are acceptable with regard to their chain of narration, inform us of the coming of a generous [[caliph]]; (Muslim, No: 7318) however, if they are deeply deliberated upon, it becomes evident that the caliph they refer to is [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]] who was the last caliph from a Sunni standpoint. This prediction of the Prophet has thus materialized in his personality, word for word. One need not wait for any other Mahdi now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ahmed Hulusi]] interpreted the Mahdi as a part of the inner self. Therefore, the Mahdi awakes in a person to defeat the inner [[Dajjal]]. The Mahdi stands for attaining selflessness and realizing a person's own existence as a part of [[God in Islam|God]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Hulusi ''The Observing One'' Softcover {{ISBN|978-0-615-63664-1}} page 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shia Islam==

===Ahadith===
{{Primary sources|date=November 2017}}
* [[Muhammad]] is reported in hadith to have said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Mahdi is the protector of the knowledge, the heir to the knowledge of all the [[Islamic prophet|prophets]], and is aware of all things.&lt;ref&gt;''Bihar al-Anwar'': '''95''': 378; '''102''': 67, 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mikyaal al-Makaarem'': '''1''': 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dominion (authority) of the Mahdi is one of the proofs that God has created all things; these are so numerous that his [the Mahdi's] proofs will overcome (will be influential, will be dominant) everyone and nobody will have any counter-proposition against him.&lt;ref&gt;Baqr al-Majlisi 2003: 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;People will flee from him [the Mahdi] as sheep flee from the shepherd. Later, people will begin to look for a purifier. But since they can find none to help them but him, they will begin to run to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Bihar al-Anwar'': '''52''': 326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When matters are entrusted to competent [the Mahdi], Almighty God will raise the lowest part of the world for him, and lower the highest places. So much that he will see the whole world as if in the palm of his hand. Which of you cannot see even a single hair in the palm of his hand?&lt;ref&gt;''Bihar al-Anwar'': '''5''': 328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the time of the Mahdi, a Muslim in the East will be able to see his Muslim brother in the West, and he in the West will see him in the East.&lt;ref&gt;''Bihar al-Anwar'': '''52''': 391&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the Fourth ([[Isma'ili]]) or Fifth (Twelver) Imam said of the Mahdi:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Master of the Command was named as the Mahdi because he will dig out the [[Torah]] and other heavenly books from the cave in [[Antioch]]. He will judge among the [[Jews|people of the Torah]] according to the Torah; among the [[Christians|people of the Gospel]] according to the [[New Testament|Gospel]]; among the people of the Psalms in accordance with the [[Psalms]]; among the people of the Qur'an in accordance with the Qur'an.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the Sixth Imam, made the following prophecies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Abu Bashir says: When I asked Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, "O son of the Messenger of God! Who is the Mahdi (''[[Al-Qa'im (person)|qa'im]]'') of your clan (''[[ahl al-bayt]]'')?", he replied: "The Mahdi will conquer the world; at that time the world will be illuminated by the light of God, and everywhere in which those other than God are worshipped will become places where God is worshiped; and even if the [[Polytheism|polytheists]] do not wish it, the only faith on that day will be the religion of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Bihar al-Anwar'': '''51''': 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sadir al-Sayrafi says: I heard from Imam Abu Abdullah Ja'far al-Sadiq that: Our modest Imam, to whom this occultation belongs [the Mahdi], who is deprived of and denied his rights, will move among them and wander through their markets and walk where they walk, but they will not recognize him ().&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Nomani: 189 (Sheikh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Nomani, al-Ghaybah al-Nomani, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Abu Bashir says: I heard Imam Muhammad al-Baqr say: "He said: When the Mahdi appears he will follow in the path of the Messenger of God. Only he [the Mahdi] can explain the works of the Messenger of God.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Nomani: 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The face of the Mahdi shall shine upon the surface of the Moon.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ja'far al-Sadiq&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Twelevers, the main goal of the Mahdi will be to establish an Islamic state and to apply Islamic laws that were revealed to Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Sayyed Hossein. "Expectation of the Millennium : Shiìsm in History," State University of New York Press, 1989, p. 19, {{ISBN|978-0-88706-843-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahdi is believed to be the Twelfth Imam, [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]].&lt;ref name="Brit"&gt;"mahdī." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; they believe that the Twelfth Imam will return from the Occultation as the Mahdi with "a company of his chosen ones," and his enemies will be led by [[Masih ad-Dajjal|Antichrist]] and the [[Sufyani]]. The two armies will fight "one final apocalyptic battle" where the Mahdi and his forces will prevail over evil. After the Mahdi has ruled [[Earth]] for a number of years, [[Jesus in Islam#Life##Second coming|Isa]] will return.&lt;ref name=momen /&gt;

===Quran===
{{Religious text primary|date=September 2017}}
According to some interpretations of the Quran, throughout the history of human life, the earth has never been without divine leaders and Allah has selected an appropriate man for every nation. There are two types of Quranic verses which one can find out the existence of Imam Mahdi and advent of him.
1-Some verses show the necessity of the existence of Imam such as "…You are only a warner, and there is a guide for every people (13:7). Imam Sadiq has said in this regard: there is a leader from our family at any time and guides people to the straight path.&lt;ref&gt;[Bihār al-Anwār, vol23, p5)&lt;/ref&gt;
2-Some verses give good news that the government of believers will be created; such as this verse: “Certainly We wrote in the Psalms, after the Torah:" Indeed, My righteous servants shall inherit the earth."&lt;ref&gt;(21:105)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctrine regarding longevity===
{{Religious text primary|date=September 2017}}
Shia strongly believe that the prolonged lifespan of Mahdi is thoroughly justified according to rational, Quranic, traditional, research-based and historical accounts. In this regard, some reasons will be expressed: 
1-The Quran includes verses that can show the Shia claim regarding the possibility of the prolonged lifespan of the Mahdi such as the fourteenth verse of chapter Al-Ankabut (29). In this verse, Prophet Noah invited his people to God for 950 years. Some Hadiths say that he lived for 2500 years.&lt;ref&gt;[Shaikh Saduq, Kamal-u-Din wa Tamam-u-Ne’mah, p.523.]&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-fifth verse of chapter Al-Kahf is the other one. This verse states that the People of the Cave lived for 309 years asleep in the cave.
2-Narrations from Imams allege the feasibility of a long-lasting life span in humans. For instance, Shia sources have been emphasized the longevity of Khizr; besides, the meeting of Ali and Khizr is stated in Shia sources.&lt;ref&gt;[ Kitāb al-Ghayba, al-Shaykh al-Tusi, p 155]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twelver===
[[File:Samarra City 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Al-Askari Shrine|Mosque of Al-Askari]] in [[Samarra]], [[Iraq]], 2017. This is where [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Twelver Imams]] [[Ali al-Hadi]] and Al-[[Hasan al-Askari]], respectively considered the grandfather and father of the Twelver Mahdi, are buried.]]

For [[Twelver]] Shi'ites, the Mahdi was born but disappeared, and would remain hidden from humanity until he reappears to bring justice to the world, a doctrine known as [[Occultation (Islam)|the Occultation]]. For them, this "hidden Imam" is [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], the [[The Twelve Imams|Twelfth Imam]]. According to Shia Quran commentators,{{Which|date=August 2017}} implicit references to the Mahdi can be found in the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/mahdi-quran-according-shiite-quran-commentators-vasran-toussi|title=Mahdi in the Quran According to Shi‘ite Quran Commentators|website=Al-Islam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelver Shi'ites (as the main branch of Shia, which consists of 85% of all Shia Muslims&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/shia-islam-s-holiest-sites.html|title=Shia Islam's Holiest Sites|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/|title=World Population Clock: 7.5 Billion People (2017) - Worldometers|website=www.worldometers.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Atlas of the Middle East (Second ed.). Washington D.C: National Geographic|2008|pp.=80-81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The World Factbook 2010|Retrieved 2010-08-25.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) claim that their twelfth Imam, Muhammad b. al-Hasan al-Askari, who went into occultation around 256/873-874, is the promised Mahdi, who will appear before the day of Judgement, to restore justice and equity on earth.&lt;ref name="Sachedina"/&gt;
In Shia Islam, the Mahdi is associated with the belief in [[the Occultation]], that the Mahdi is a "hidden Imam" who has already been born and who will one day return alongside Jesus to fill the world with justice.&lt;ref name=religionfacts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/islam/comparison_charts/islamic_sects.htm |title=Comparison of Shias and Sunnis |publisher=Religionfacts.com |accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promised Mahdi, who is usually mentioned in Shia Islam by his title of Imam-Al-Asr (the
Imam of the "Period") and Sahib al-Zaman (the Lord of the Age), is the son of
the eleventh Imam. His name is the same as that of the Prophet of Islam. According to Shia Islam, Mahdi was
born in [[Samarra]] in 868 and until 872 when his father was martyred,
lived under his father's care and tutelage. He was hidden from public view and
only a few of the elite among the Shi’ah were able to meet him.&lt;ref name=Tabatabai&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tabatabai|first1=Sayyid Muhammad Hossein|title=Shi'ite Islam|date=1975|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0-87395-272-3|pages=210–211 (185–186 in the ebook)|edition=First|url=http://islamicbookbank.org/Files/21d1af68-b0c1-4e28-8b42-1f97feac88b0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By Shi'ism, belief in the messianic Imam is not a part of their creed but it is the foundation of their creed.&lt;ref name="Sachedina"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sachedina |first=Abdulaziz  |title=A Treatise on the Occultation of the Twelfth Imāmite Imam
|journal=Studia Islamica |issue=48|pages=109–124 |jstor=4099480
|date=1978 }}{{Subscription required |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Shias believe that after the martyrdom of his father he became Imam and by Divine Command went into occultation (ghaybat). Thereafter he appeared only to his deputies (na’ib) and even then only in exceptional circumstances.
&lt;ref name=Tabatabai /&gt;

In Shias' perspective, Mahdi chose as a special deputy for a time Uthman ibn Sa’id ’Umari, one of the companions of his father and grandfather who was his confidant and
trusted friend. Through his deputy Mahdi would answer the demands and questions of the Shias. After Uthman ibn Sa’id, his son Muhammad ibn Uthman Umari was appointed the deputy of him. After the death of Muhammad ibn Uthman, Abu’l Qasim Husayn ibn Ruh Nawbakhti was the special
deputy, and after his death Ali ibn Muhammad Simmari was chosen for this
task.&lt;ref name=Tabatabai /&gt;

A few days before the death of Ali ibn Muhammad Simmari in 939 an order was issued by Mahdi stating that in six days Ali ibn Muhammad Simmari would die. Henceforth the special deputation of the Imam would come to an end and the major occultation (ghaybat-i kubra) would begin and would
continue until the day God grants permission to the Imam to manifest himself.&lt;ref name=Tabatabai /&gt;

In Shia view, the occultation of Mahdi is, therefore, divided into two parts:
the first, the minor occultation (ghaybat-i sughra) which began in 872 and ended in 939, lasting about seventy years; the second, the major occultation which commenced in 939 and will continue as long as God wills it. In a
hadith upon whose authenticity Shia and Sunni agree, Muhammad has said, "If there were to remain in the life of the world but one day, God would prolong that day until He sends in it a man from my community and my household. His name will be the same as my name. He will fill the earth with equity and justice as it was filled with oppression and tyranny." &lt;ref name=Tabatabai /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ibn Masud|first1=Abdallah|title=al Fusul al Muhimmah|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shias believe that the arrival of the Mahdi will be signalled by the following portents:&lt;ref name=momen /&gt;
* The vast majority of people who profess to be Muslim will be so only in name despite their practice of Islamic rites, and it will be they who will make war with the Mahdi.
* Before his coming will come the red death and the white death, killing two thirds of the world's population. The red death signifies violence and the white death is [[Plague (disease)|plague]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} One third of the world's population will die from the red death and the other third from the white death.
* Several figures will appear: the Al-Harth, Al-Mansur, Shuaib bin Saleh and the [[Sufyani]].
* There will be a great conflict in the land of [[Greater Syria|Syria]], until it is destroyed.
* Death and fear will afflict the people of [[Baghdad]] and [[Iraq]]. A fire will appear in the sky and a redness will cover them.

Shia traditions also state that the Mahdi be "a young man of medium stature with a handsome face" and black hair and beard. "He will not come in an odd year [...] will appear in Mecca between the corner of the [[Kaaba]] and the station of Abraham and people will witness him there.&lt;ref name=momen /&gt;

===Isma'ili===
The [[Ismāʿīlī]] developed their own theory of the Mahdi with select Ismāʿīlī [[Imams]] representing the concept of Mahdi or [[Al-Qa'im (person)]] at various times. For the [[Sevener]] Ismāʿīlī, the Imāmate ended with Isma'il ibn Ja'far, whose son [[Muhammad ibn Ismail]] was the expected Mahdi that Ja'far al-Sadiq had preached about. However, at this point the Ismāʿīlī Imāms according to the [[Nizari]] and [[Musta'li]] found areas where they would be able to be safe from the recently founded [[Abbasid Caliphate]], which had defeated and seized control from the Umayyads in 750 CE. During the period of Ja'far, the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] replaced the Umayyads and began to aggressively oppose belief in an Imamate. Due to strong suppression by the Abbasids, the seventh Ismāʿīlī Imam, [[Muhammad ibn Ismail]], went into a period of [[The Occultation#Ismaili|Occultation]]. During this period his representative, the ''Dāʿī'', maintained the community. The names of the eighth, ninth, and tenth Imams are considered by some traditions to be "hidden", known only by their nicknames due to threats from the Abbasids. 

The 11th Imam, [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah]], founded the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in 909 CE in [[Ifriqiya]] (present [[Tunisia]]), ending the first occultation. In Ismāʿīlī eyes this act again united the Imamate and the Caliphate in one person. The Fatimids then extended up to the central [[Maghreb]] (now including [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]]). They entered and conquered Egypt in 969 CE during the reign of the fourteenth Imam, [[al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah]], and made [[Cairo]] their capital. After the eighteenth Imam, [[al-Mustansir Billah]], the Nizari sect believed that his son [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|Nizar]] was his successor, while another Ismāʿīlī branch known as the Mustaali (from whom the Dawoodi Bohra would eventually form), supported his other son, [[al-Musta'li]]. The Fatimid dynasty continued with al-Musta'li as both Imam and Caliph, and that joint position held until the 20th Imam, [[al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah]] (1132 CE). At the death of 20th Imam Amir, one branch of the Mustaali faith claimed that he had transferred the Imamate to his son [[At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim]], who was then two years old. Tayyeb's claim to the imamate was endorsed by the ''Hurrah al-Malika'' ("the Noble Queen") [[Arwa al-Sulayhi]], the Queen of [[Yemen]], who created the office of the [[Dai al-Mutlaq]] to administer the community in the Imam's absence. [[Zoeb bin Moosa]] (d.546 [[Hijri year|AH]]/1151&amp;nbsp;CE) was the first Dai-ul-Mutlaq, and lived and died in Haus, Yemen.&lt;ref name="DaftaryIsmailis1990p104"&gt;{{cite book |first=Farhad |last=Daftary |title=The Ismāʿīlīs: Their history and doctrines |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge UniversityPress |year=1990 |isbn=0-521-42974-9 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tayyibis (which include the [[Dawoodi Bohra]]) believe the second and current period of occultation (''satr'') began after Imam Tayyeb went into seclusion and Imam from his progeny is very much present as Mahdi on earth every time.

{{See also|Prophethood in Ahmadiyya Islam|Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam}}
In Ahmadiyya belief the terms "[[Messiah]]" and "Mahdi" are synonymous terms for one and the same person. Like the term Messiah which, among other meanings, in essence means being ''anointed'' by God or ''appointed'' by God the term "Mahdi" means ''guided'' by God, thus both imply a direct ordination or commissioning and a spiritual nurturing by God of a divinely chosen individual. According to Ahmadiyya thought the prophesied eschatological figures of Christianity and Islam, the Messiah and Mahdi, were in fact to be fulfilled in one person who was to represent all previous prophets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=2739&amp;region=E1&amp;CR= |title=The Holy Quran |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prophecies concerning the Mahdi or the [[Second Coming of Jesus]] are seen by Ahmadis as metaphorical and subject to interpretation. It is argued that one was to be born and rise within the dispensation of [[Muhammad]], who by virtue of his similarity and affinity with Jesus, and the similarity in nature, temperament and disposition of the people of Jesus' time and the people of the time of the promised one (the Mahdi) is called by the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prophecy Continuous: Aspects of Ahmadi Religious Thought and its Medieval Background|last=Friedmann|first=Yohanan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These prophecies according to Ahmadi Muslims have been fulfilled in the person of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] (1835–1908), the founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement, who claimed to be divinely appointed as the second coming of Jesus and the Mahdi in 1891 around the same point in time after [[Muhammad]] as Jesus had appeared after [[Moses]] (thirteen centuries). Contrary to mainstream Islam, the Ahmadis do not believe that Jesus is alive in heaven, but claim that he survived the crucifixion and migrated towards the east where he died a natural death and that Ghulam Ahmad was only the promised spiritual second coming and likeness of Jesus, the promised Messiah and Mahdi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesus: A humble prophet of God|url=http://www.alislam.org/topics/jesus/|publisher=Ahmadiyya Muslim Community|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Francis.

The Mahdavia sect, founded by [[Muhammad Jaunpuri]] commonly known as Nur Pak claimed to be the Mahdi in Mecca, in front of Kaaba (between rukn and maqam) in the Hijri year 901(10th Hijri), and is revered as such by Mahdavia. He was born in Jaunpur, traveled throughout India, Arabia and Khorasan, where he died at the town of Farah, Afghanistan at the age of 63. The Mahdavi regard Jaunpuri as the Imam Mahdi, the [[Caliph]] of Allah and the second most important figure after the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]].

{{Main article|People claiming to be the Mahdi}}
[[File:Muhammad Ahmad.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Muhammad Ahmad]], a Sudanese Sufi sheikh, created a state, the ''[[Muhammad Ahmad#Mahdiyah|Mahdiyah]]'', on the basis of his claim to be the Mahdi.]]
The following individuals (or their adherents on their behalf) have claimed to be the Mahdi:
* The first historical reference to a movement using the name of Mahdi is [[al-Mukhtar]]'s rebellion against the [[Umayyad caliphate]] in 686 CE, almost 50 years after Muhammad's death. Al-Mukhtar claimed that [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah]], a son of the fourth [[caliph]], [[Ali]], was the Mahdi and would save the Muslim people from the rule of the [[Umayyad]]s. Ibn al-Hanifiyyah himself was not actively involved in the rebellion, and when the Umayyads successfully quashed it, they left him undisturbed.

{{Marxism|Aspects}}

{{Criminology and penology|schools}}

'''Marxist criminology''' is one of the [[School (discipline)|schools]] of [[criminology]]. It parallels the work of the [[structural functionalism]] school which focuses on what produces stability and continuity in [[society]] but, unlike the functionalists, it adopts a predefined [[political philosophy]]. As in [[conflict criminology]], it focuses on why things change, identifying the disruptive forces in industrialized societies, and describing how society is divided by power, wealth, prestige, and the perceptions of the world. "The shape and character of the legal system in complex societies can be understood as deriving from the conflicts inherent in the structure of these societies which are stratified economically and politically" (Chambliss, 1971, p3). It is concerned with the causal relationships between society and crime, i.e. to establish a critical understanding of how the immediate and structural social environment gives rise to crime and criminogenic conditions.

[[Karl Marx]] argued that the [[law]] is the mechanism by which one [[social class]], usually referred to as the "ruling class", keeps all the other classes in a disadvantaged position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Criminological Theory: The Essentials|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XPA44ThcnJkC|publisher = SAGE Publications|date = 2011-04-06|isbn = 9781412992343|language = en|first = Stephen G.|last = Tibbetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this school uses a Marxist lens through which, ''inter alia'' (among other things), to consider the criminalization process, and by which explain why some acts are defined as [[Deviance (sociology)|deviant]] whereas others are not. It is therefore interested in [[political crime]], [[state crime]], and [[state-corporate crime]].

==Discussion==
Marxism provides a systematic theoretical basis upon which to interrogate social structural arrangements, and the hypothesis that economic power is translated into political power substantially accounts for the general disempowerment of the majority who live in the modern state and the limitations of political [[discourse]]. Hence, whether directly or indirectly, it informs much of the research into social phenomena not only in criminology, but also in [[semiotics]] and the other disciplines which explore the structural relationships of power, knowledge, meaning, and positional interests within society.

Many criminologists agree{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} that for a society to function efficiently, social order is necessary and that conformity is induced through a [[socialization]] process. "Law" is the label given to one of the means used to enforce the interests of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Hence, because each state is [[sovereignty|sovereign]], the law can be used for any purpose. It is also common ground that, whether the society is [[meritocratic]], [[democracy|democratic]] or [[autocratic]], a small group emerges to lead. The reason for this group's emergence may be their ability to use power more effectively, or simple expediency in that, as population size grows, the delegation of decision-making powers to a group representative of the majority leads to more efficiency. Marxists are critical of the ideas, values and norms of capitalist ideology, and characterize the modern state as being under the control of the group that owns the means of production. For example, Chambliss (1973) examined the way in which the vagrancy laws were amended to reflect the interests of the ruling elite. He also looked at how British Colonial Law was applied in East Africa, so that the capitalist "ruling class" could profit from coffee plantations,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  and how the law in medieval England benefited feudal landowners.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  Similarly, Pearce (2003) looks at evidence that corporate crime is widespread but is rarely prosecuted.

These researchers assert that political power is used to reinforce [[economic inequality]] by embedding individual property rights in the law and that the resulting poverty is one of the causes of criminal activity as a means of survival. Marxists argue that a socialist society with communal ownership of the means of production would have much less crime. Indeed, Milton Mankoff asserts that there is much less crime in Western Europe than in the United States because Europe is more ‘Socialist’ than America. The implication of such views is that the solution to the "crime problem" is to engage in a socialist revolution.

A different issue emerges by applying [[Marx's theory of alienation]]. A proportion of crime is said to be the result of society offering only demeaning work with little sense of creativity. However, the characterization of some crime as "working class crime" and portraying it as a response to oppression is problematic. It selectively labels crime committed by people simply on the basis of their membership of a class, without engaging in [[victimology]] to identify whether any particular class or group is most likely to be the victim of such crime (because many criminals are disinclined to travel far, working class crime is often directed at working-class people who live in the same neighborhood). In fact, the social differentiation of crime may vary by age, class, ethnicity, gender, and locality.

Further, if ''[[anomie]]'' is a primary cause of crime, there should be a [[theory]] to explain why only some working-class people commit crimes. These are existential issues. But if there is evidence that some individuals and, in some cases, entire groups are [[social alienation|alienated]] from mainstream society, there should be detailed research into the effect that this has on society as a whole (see [[normlessness]]). In such research, Marxism tends to focus on societal forces rather than the motives of individuals and their dualistic capacity for both right and wrong, moral and immoral. This can lead to a less comprehensive explanation of why people exercise their autonomy by choosing to act in particular ways. By comparison, in the [[sociology of deviance]], [[Robert K. Merton]] borrows [[Durkheim]]'s concept of ''anomie'' to form the [[Strain theory (sociology)|Strain Theory]]. Merton argues that the real problem of alienation is not created by a sudden social change, as Durkheim proposed, but rather by a social structure that holds out the same goals to all its members without giving them equal means to achieve them. It is this lack of integration between what the culture calls for and what the structure permits that causes deviant behaviour. Deviance then is a symptom of the social structure. Taylor et al. intend a combination of Interactionism and Marxism as a radical alternative to previous theories to formulate a "fully social theory of deviance".{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} 
 
The power to label behaviour as "deviant" arises partly from the unequal distribution of power within the state, and because the judgment carries the authority of the state, it attributes greater stigma to the prohibited behaviour. This is true no matter what the political orientation of the state. All states enact laws which, to a greater or lesser extent, protect property. This may take the form of [[theft]], or prohibit damage or trespass. Even though a theft law may not appear judgmental, a Marxist analysis of the conviction rates may detect inequalities in the way in which the law is applied.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  Thus, the decision whether to prosecute or to convict may be skewed by having the resources to employ a good [[lawyer]]. The same analysis may also show that the distribution of [[punishment]] for any given crime may vary according to the social class of the perpetrator. But, the law of theft exists to protect the interests of all those who own property. It does not discriminate by reference to the class of the owner. Indeed, few laws in any states are drafted to protect property interests by reference to class, and the acceptance and enforcement of laws generally depend on a consensus within the community that such laws meet local needs. In this, a comparison of the crime rates between states shows little correlation by reference to political orientation. Such correlations as do exist tend to reflect disparities between rich and poor, and features describing the development of the social and economic environment. Hence, the crimes rates are comparable in states where there are the largest disparities of wealth distribution, regardless of whether they are first, second or third world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

[[Ronald L. Akers]] has criticized Marxist criminology on the grounds that societies based on Marxist principles "have been unjust and repressive and do not represent a future for which criminologists should strive".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Akers |first=Ronald L. |date=1979-02-01 |title=Theory and Ideology in Marxist Criminology |journal=Criminology |language=en |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=527–544 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1979.tb01391.x |issn=1745-9125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual theorists==

===Willem Adriaan Bonger===
Dutch criminologist, Willem Bonger, who believed in a causal link between crime and economic and social conditions. He asserted that crime is social in origin and a normal response to prevailing cultural conditions. In more primitive societies, he contended that survival requires more selfless [[altruism]] within the community. But once agricultural technology improved and a surplus of food was generated, systems of exchange and barter began offering the opportunity for selfishness. As capitalism emerged, there were social forces of competition and wealth, resulting in an unequal distribution of resources, avarice and individualism.  Once self-interest and more egoistic impulses assert themselves, crime emerges. The poor would commit crime out of need or out of a sense of injustice. Hence, those with power exercise control and impose punishment, equating the definition of crime with harm or threat of harm to the property and business interests of the powerful. Although the inherent activities comprising, say, a theft, may be identical, theft by the poor will be given greater emphasis than theft by the rich. This will have two consequences: direct which will increase the pressure for survival in an unequal society, and indirect in that it will increase a sense of alienation among the poor. Crime in the streets was a result of the miserable conditions in which workers lived in competition with one another. He believed that poverty alone could not be a cause of crime but rather poverty coupled with individualism, materialism, false needs, racism, and the false masculinity of violence and domination among street thugs.

===Thorsten Sellin===
[[Thorsten Sellin|Sellin]] was a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the pioneers of scientific criminology. His method involved a comprehensive view of the subject incorporating historical, sociological, psychological, and legal factors into the analysis. He applied both Marxism and Conflict Theory to an examination of the cultural diversity of modern industrial society. In a homogeneous society, norms or codes of behaviour will emerge and become laws where enforcement is necessary to preserve the unitary culture. But where separate cultures diverge from the mainstream, those minority groups will establish their own norms. Socialization will therefore be to the subgroup and to the mainstream norms. When laws are enacted, they will represent the norms, values and interests of the dominant cultural or ethnic groups in a state which may produce Border Culture Conflict. When the two cultures interact and one seeks to extend its influence into the other, each side is likely to react protectively. If the balance of power is relatively equal, an accommodation will usually be reached. But if the distribution of power is unequal, the everyday behaviour of the minority group may be defined as deviant. The more diversified and heterogeneous a society becomes, the greater the probability of more frequent conflict as subgroups who live by their own rules break the rules of other groups.

The '''Olympus Geological History Museum''' ({{lang-el|Μουσείο Γεωλογικής Ιστορίας Ολύμπου}}, ''Mouseio Geologikis Istorias Olympou'') is a [[Geology museum|geological museum]] in the town of [[Leptokarya]] at the foot of [[Mount Olympus]] in northern [[Greece]]. It presents in several exhibition rooms, rocks and minerals from the region and fossils from the Olympus and from the surrounding area. It was established with the help of the Geology faculty of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.auth.gr/en/geo|title=School of Geology | publisher=[[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] | website=www.auth.gr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure of the museum ==
While finds from the whole of Greece are exhibited in the classrooms, a separate exhibition room is devoted exclusively to Mount Olympus. The history of the formation of the mountains is shown. Various types of fossilized plants and [[fossils]] are exhibited.

== The exhibits ==
[[File:Versteinerte Muscheln.jpg|thumb|Fossilized [[mussel]]s]]
The geological development of Greece will be explained with the help of folders. Using a model of the Olympus, the distribution of the various types of rock in the mountain range is shown. All known types of rocks occurring in the Olympus region are exhibited in showcases.

As a result of the displacement of the continental plates, Olympus is still pushed up by one to four millimeters per year. This is the reason why there are petrified marine animals at a height of around 1000 to 1500 meters. A hitherto unique find was an ammonite found at an altitude of about 1100 meters. Other witnesses who were part of the mountain formerly under the sea level are limestones that were drilled by mussels (Litophagae) or limestones include petrified sea-worms.

The Olymp is a so-called tectonic window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/233934099_fig2_Fig-2-Geographic-map-of-the-Olympus-region-of-northeastern-mainland-Greece-showing|title=Fig. 2. Geographic map of the Olympus region of northeastern mainland...|website=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that erosion and warping have released old rock layers that would normally be hidden. This fact ensures that geologists from all over the world travel to Olympus for research purposes.

Further panels explain that Mount Olympus got its present form after the [[Würm]] ice age. As the ice receded, masses of gravel were moved along. This process shaped the landscape and influenced the shape of some stones. They are round at the top and flattened at the bottom.

A showcase is devoted to the theme of petrification. Exhibited are petrified plants and animals.

So far only a few smaller caves have been discovered. Some of them are filled with ice which does not melt even in summer.

There is the possibility of astronomical observations at night.

== Cooperation ==
Since 2013, this private museum has been cooperating with the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]]. In two classrooms, school classes are taught about the geology of Mount Olympus.

'''Palo''', also known as '''Las Reglas de Congo''', is a religion with various denominations which developed in Cuba among Central African slaves and their descendants who originated in the [[Congo Basin]]. It is completely different from Santería and Ifa.  Denominations often referred to as "branches" of Palo include ''Mayombe'' (or ''Mallombe''), ''Monte'', ''Briyumba'' (or ''Brillumba''), and ''Kimbisa''. The Spanish word ''palo'' "stick" was applied to the religion in Cuba due to the use of wooden sticks in the preparation of [[altar]]s, which were also called ''la [[Nganga]]'', ''el caldero'', ''nkisi'' or ''la prenda''. Priests of Palo are known as ''Paleros'', ''Tatas'' (men), ''Yayas'' (women) or ''Nganguleros''. Initiates are known as ''ngueyos'' or ''pino nuevo''.&lt;ref name="ma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="o"/&gt;&lt;ref name="w"/&gt;

==History==
Palo has its roots in the [[Congo Basin]] of [[Central Africa]], from where large numbers of [[Kongo people|Kongo]] slaves were brought to [[Cuba]] where the religion was derived. Its mainly a product of [[BaKongo religion]] but has been influenced by other faiths.&lt;ref name="PaloBook"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Erwan Dianteill|title=Kongo in Cuba: the Transformations of an African Religion|url=https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_ASSR_117_0004--congo-to-cuba-transformations-of-an.htm |publisher=Centre for the Interdisciplinary Study of Religious Phenomena|pages=59-80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palo's [[Sacred language|liturgical language]] is a mixture of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Bantu languages]], known as ''lengua'', ''bozal'' or ''[[habla Congo]].''&lt;ref name="o"/&gt;

==Belief system and rituals==
{{Kongo religion sidebar}}
[[Image:Nganga Museo de Guanabacoa.jpg|thumb|Nganga in Cuba]]
The Palo belief system rests on two main pillars:
* The veneration of the spirits.
* The belief in natural/earth powers.

All natural objects, and particularly sticks, are thought to be infused with powers, often linked to the powers of spirits. This differs from the [[orisha]]s of Santería and other Yoruba religions, which are associated with archetypal human beings.&lt;ref name="o"/&gt;

A certain number of spirits called ''Kimpungulu'' (singular: ''Mpungu'') inhabit the ''[[Nkisi]]'' (sacred objects; also spelled ''Enkisi'', ''Inquice'', or ''Inquise''). Kimpungulu are well known in name and deed, and are often venerated as spirits with anthropomorphic qualities. They are powerful entities, but they are ranked below the Supreme Creator ''Zambi'' or ''[[Nzambi a Mpungu|Nzambi]]'', making Palo a [[Henotheism|henotheistic]] religion.

The main practice of Palo focuses upon the religious receptacle or altar known as "''la [[Nganga]]''", "''el caldero''", "''nkisi''" or "''la prenda''". This is a consecrated vessel which serves as a microcosm. Each Nganga is dedicated to a specific ''mpungu''. Often, this religious vessel is also believed to be inhabited by a spirit of the dead (almost never the direct ancestor of the object's owner), also referred to as "''Nfumbe''", who acts as a guide for all religious activities which are performed with the ''Nganga''. Colors, clothing, and stylized dances associated with a particular deity, a common feature of Santeria and other Yoruba religion, are not found in Palo.&lt;ref name="o"/&gt;

Music in Palo practices begin with wooden percussion instruments followed by drums. Examples are the catá, guaguá, and the ngoma, or conga. The cowbell, hoe, and plow are used as metallic instruments.&lt;ref name="w"/&gt;

Various [[divination]] methods are used in Palo. ''Chamalongos'' uses shells of various materials, often coconut shells. A more traditional method, ''Vititi Mensú'', is a form of envisioning or [[scrying]] using a sanctified animal horn capped with a mirror.

Denominations are further broken down into temple homes known as ''munansós'' that are headed by an experienced elder priest or priestess. There is no central authority figure in Palo.

==Syncretism==
Religious [[syncretism]] with Catholicism is prevalent within Palo due to the fact that the Kingdom of the Kongo adapted the Catholic religion and created a form of Kongo-Catholicism as early as the 15th century. Iconography and the lack thereof is a reflection of dual socio-politics beliefs that have been in opposition for centuries. In Cuba they are categorized as ''Palo Cristiano'' (Christian Palo), which uses the crucifix and images of [[saint|Catholic saints]] as representations of the kimpungulu versus ''Palo Judio'' (Jewish Palo), where there is no Catholic imagery/iconography to be found. Although the name Palo Judio literally means "Jewish Palo" the term "Jewish" as used here does not refer to Judaism; rather it is metaphorical shorthand for "refusing to convert to Christianity", that is, in the case of Palo, "purely Congo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Jewish" and "Christian" Palo in Cuba|url=http://nylatinojournal.com/home/theology/americas/jewish_and_christian_palo_in_cuba.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Higher Gods==
* Nzambi
* Lukankazi

'''Kimpungulu''' 
* Nkuyu (Nkuyo, Mañunga, Lubaniba, Lucero, Lucero Mundo, Remolino, Cuarto Vientos, Kbuyu) - the deity of forests and roads, a guide and balance. He guards the entry of a cemetery and is considered the guardian of the moon. He is equivalent to [[Elegua]] or [[Eshu]] in Yoruba religion and associated with the [[Holy Infant of Atocha]].
* [[Kengue]] (Mama Kengue, Yola, Tiembla Tierra, Pandilanga) - the Sky Father and the primordial creator of all life, and deity of knowledge and justice, equivalent to [[Obatala]] in Yoruba religion and syncretized with the [[Virgin of Mercy]].
* Kobayende
* Mariguanda
* Gurufinda
* Kalunga
* Chola Wengue
* Kimbabula
* Watariamba
* Nsasi
* Sarabanda (Zarabanda, Rompe Monte) - a strong and willful deity, equivalent to [[Ogum]] in Yoruba religion and associated with [[Saint Peter]]. The Nganga dedicated to Sarabanda must be made of iron with three legs.&lt;ref name="ma"/&gt;

==Controversy==
Palo has been linked to a rash of [[grave robbing]] in [[Venezuela]]. Residents report that many of the graves at [[Caracas]]' Cementerio General del Sur have been pried open to have their contents removed for use in Palo ceremonies.&lt;ref name="v"/&gt; In 1995, the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] arrested a Palo Mayombe high priest in [[Miami, Florida]], who was in possession of several human skulls as well as the remains of exotic animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pacenti|first1=John|title='Occult Cop' Walks Beat on the Dark Side|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/feb/15/news/mn-19301|accessdate=16 February 2018|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=15 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Newark, New Jersey]], in 2002, a Palo practitioner was found to have the remains of at least two dead bodies inside pots within the basement, along with items looted from a tomb.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; A [[Connecticut]] Palo Mayombe priest was arrested in 2015 for allegedly stealing bones from [[mausoleum]]s in a [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge suppresses some evidence in human bone theft case|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/judge-suppresses-some-evidence-in-human-bone-theft-case/|accessdate=16 February 2018|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wat Yannawa - 007 Brahma (12130018383).jpg|thumb|Phra Phrom at [[Wat Yannawa]] in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]]]

'''Phra Phrom''' ({{lang-th|พระพรหม}}; from [[Sanskrit]]: '''[[Brahma]]''', ब्रह्म) is the [[Culture of Thailand|Thai]] representation of the [[Hindu]] god [[Brahma]] (the god of the manifested world),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tourismthailand.org/Attraction/Erawan-Shrine--2140&lt;/ref&gt; who is regarded in Thai culture as a deity of good fortune and protection. According to [[puranas]], [[Brahma]] has four faces representing four [[Vedas]] or knowledge coming from four directions: north, south, east and west&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Holdrege (2012), Veda and Torah: Transcending the Textuality of Scripture, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438406954}}, pages 88-89&lt;/ref&gt;. Phra Phrom is colloquially known outside Thailand as the '''Four-Faced Awakened One''' (四面佛, ''Sìmiànfó'') or '''Four-Faced God''' (四面神 ''Simianshen'') among [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] [[Chinese folk religion|folk religious]] worshippers, among whom the faith of this god has spread in the latest decades.

==Worship==
Worshippers of the god usually offer incense, candles, jasmine flowers or jasmine garlands and young coconut milk (with water in them) in their worship, usually placing these offerings before all four heads of Phra Phrom, each head representing a different aspect of the deity; it is believed each side of Phra Phrom offers different blessings. Another common way of worship is to place wooden elephant statues on the altar to honor him. Phra Phrom is also known to admire Thai classical music, which is played near larger scale outdoor altars, accompanied by dancers. For a small fee, the dancers include worshiper's name into the songs they sing while dancing. Worshipers of Phra Phrom are also usually advised to abstain from consuming meat. It is also believed that worshipers have to make good on any promises made to the deity else misfortune will befall them instead of the fortune that was asked for. Items needed for prayers are available in the premises of the shrine.

The main example of this representation of Brahma is the statue at the [[Erawan Shrine]] in [[Bangkok]], where the faith of the god has its origins in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangkok-traveltips.com/erawan-shrine.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The golden dome of the [[Government House of Thailand]] also contains a statue of Phra Phrom.

== Spread of the cult among Chinese ==

As early as the 1980s, the popularity of the Erawan cult of Brahma from its inceptions in Thailand spread, accompanied by faithful reproduction of the structure of the shrine and the image, among [[overseas Chinese]] in other countries of [[Southeast Asia]] ([[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]), in [[Taiwan]], and in [[China]], with shrines established in [[Hong Kong]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Guangzhou]].

[[File:Fulda um 1750.jpg|thumb|Adolf von [[Dalberg]], Prince-Abbot of Fulda 1726-1737]]
A '''Prince-Abbot''' ({{lang-de|Fürstabt}}) is a title for a [[clergy|cleric]] who is a [[Prince of the Church]] (like a [[Prince-Bishop]]), in the sense of an ''ex officio'' temporal lord of a [[feudalism|feudal]] entity, notably a [[Imperial State|State]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The secular territory ruled by the head of an [[abbey]] is known as '''Prince-Abbacy''' or '''Abbey-principality'''. The holder, however, does not hold the [[ecclesiastical]] office of a [[Bishop]].

The designated abbey may be a community of either [[monk]]s or [[nuns]]. Thus, because of the possibility of it being a female monastery, an abbey-principality is one of the few cases in which the rule can be restricted to female incumbents, styled '''Princess-Abbess'''.

In some cases, the holder was a [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Prince of the Holy Roman Empire]] (''Reichsfürst''), with a seat and a direct vote (''votum virile'') in the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]. Most [[Imperial immediacy|immediate]] abbots however, while bearing the title of a "Prince-Abbot", only held the status of an [[List of Imperial abbeys|Imperial prelate]] with a collective vote in the Imperial Diet. Actual Prince-Abbots were:
* the [[Fulda monastery|Abbot of Fulda]], "Archchancellor of the Empress", according to a 1220 decree by Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], elevated to a Prince-Bishopric by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1752
* the [[Prüm Abbey|Abbot of Prüm]], elevated by Emperor Frederick II in 1222, held in personal union by the [[Electorate of Trier|Archbishop of Trier]] from 1576
* the [[Abbot of Kempten]], confirmed by King [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] in 1348
* the [[Murbach Abbey|Abbot of Murbach]], elevated by King [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in 1548
* the [[Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy|Abbot of Stavelot-Malmedy]]
* the [[Corvey Abbey|Abbot of Corvey]], elevated to a Prince-Bishop in 1792

The Imperial prelates were represented in the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] by the envoys of the [[Swabian Circle|Swabian]] and Rhenish College, both holding one collective vote.

Other examples include the [[Territorial abbey|Abbot Nullius]] of [[Pinerolo]] in the [[Piedmont, Italy]] and [[Belmont Abbey, North Carolina]], which had the status of an Abbey Nullius until 1977.

[[File:Arabischer Maler um 1335 002.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Abû Zayd pleads before the Qadi of [[Ma'arra]] (1334).]]

A '''qadi''' ({{lang-ar|قاضي}}; also '''cadi''', '''kadi''' or '''kazi''') is the magistrate or judge of a [[Sharia|Shariʿa]] court, who also exercises extrajudicial functions, such as mediation, guardianship over orphans and minors, and supervision and auditing of public works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Wael|last1=B. Hallaq|authorlink=Wael B. Hallaq|title=An Introduction to Islamic law|pages=175–6|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780521678735|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
{{Usul al-fiqh}}

The term "qadi" was in use from the time of [[Muhammad]] and remained the term used for judges throughout Islamic history and the period of the [[caliphate]]s. While the [[mufti]]s and [[fuqaha]] played the role in elucidation of the principles of [[jurisprudence]] and the laws, the qadi remained the key person ensuring the establishment of justice on the basis of these very laws and rules. Thus, the qadi was chosen from amongst those who had mastered the sciences of jurisprudence and law. In constructing their legal doctrine, these legal scholars took as their point of departure the precedents already established by the qadis.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Wandfliese Gerichtssaal Alhambra.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tile at the [[Alhambra]] ولا غالب الا الله (wa-lā ġāliba illā ʾllāh)&lt;br&gt;''There is no victor except [[God]]'']]
 
During the period of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the office of the qadi al-qudat (Chief Justice of the Highest Court) was established. Among the most famous of the early qadi al-qudat was Qadi [[Abu Yusuf]] who was a disciple of the famous early jurist [[Abu Hanifa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=6EFgzjDgxOsC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=the+history+of+the+term+Qadi+in+the+islamic+world&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YsEl3IQ_ku&amp;sig=bDveHv36vGb2fGoutFgawUtLmdw&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd8qivmp_WAhUGTSYKHU6NCkMQ6AEIWDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=abu%20hanifa&amp;f=false|title=Law and Power in the Islamic World|last=Zubaida|first=Sami|date=2005-07-08|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781850439349|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of the qadi continued to be a very important one in every principality of the caliphates and sultanates of the Muslim empires over the centuries. The rulers appointed qadis in every region, town and village for judicial and administrative control and to establish peace and justice over the dominions they controlled.

The Abbasids created the office of chief qadi (qadi al-quḍāh, sometimes romanized as Qadi al-Quda), whose holder acted primarily as adviser to the caliph in the appointment and dismissal of qadis. Later Islamic states generally retained this office, while granting to its holder the authority to issue appointments and dismissals in his own name. The Mamluk state, which ruled Egypt and Syria from 1250 to 1516 CE, introduced the practice of appointing four chief qadis, one for each of the Sunni legal schools (madhhabs).

Although the primary responsibility of a qadi was a judicial one, he was generally charged with certain nonjudicial responsibilities as well, such as the administration of religious endowments (waqfs), the legitimization of the accession or deposition of a ruler, the execution of wills, the accreditation of witnesses, guardianship over orphans and others in need of protection, and supervision of the enforcement of public morals (ḥisbah).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/qadi|title=qadi {{!}} Muslim judge|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==

A qadi is a judge responsible for the application of Islamic [[positive law]] (fiqh). The office originated under the rule of the first Umayyad caliphs (AH 40–85/661–705 CE), when the provincial governors of the newly created Islamic empire, unable to adjudicate the many disputes that arose among Muslims living within their territories, began to delegate this function to others. In this early period of Islamic history, no body of Islamic positive law had yet come into existence, and the first qadis therefore decided cases on the basis of the only guidelines available to them: Arab customary law, the laws of the conquered territories, the general precepts of the Qurʾān, and their own sense of equity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

During the later Umayyad period (705–750 CE), a growing class of Muslim legal scholars, distinct from the qadis, busied themselves with the task of supplying the needed body of law, and by the time of the accession to power of the Abbasid dynasty in 750 their work could be said to have been essentially completed. In constructing their legal doctrine, these legal scholars took as their point of departure the precedents already established by the qadis, some of which they rejected as inconsistent with Islamic principles as these were coming to be understood, but most of which they adopted, with or without modification. Thus the first qadis in effect laid the foundations of Islamic positive law. Once this law had been formed, however, the role of the qadi underwent a profound change. No longer free to follow the guidelines mentioned above, a qadi was now expected to adhere solely to the new Islamic law, and this adherence has characterized the office ever since.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

A qadi continued, however, to be a delegate of a higher authority, ultimately the caliph or, after the demise of the caliphate, the supreme ruler in a given territory. This delegate status implies the absence of a separation of powers; both judicial and executive powers were concentrated in the person of the supreme ruler (caliph or otherwise). On the other hand, a certain degree of autonomy was enjoyed by a qadi in that the law that he applied was not the creation of the supreme ruler or the expression of his will. What a qadi owed to the supreme ruler was solely the power to apply the law, for which sanctions were necessary that only the supreme ruler as head of the state could guarantee.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Qadi vs Mufti==

Similar to a qadi, a [[mufti]] is also an interpreting power of Shari'a law. Muftis are jurists that give authoritative legal opinions, or [[fatwas]], and historically have been known to rank above qadis. &lt;ref&gt;William L. Cleveland, Martin Bunton (2016). A History of the Modern Middle East. Westview Press. p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; With the introduction of the secular court system in the 19th century, Ottoman councils began to enforce criminal legislation, in order to emphasize their position as part of the new executive. This creation of the hierarchical secular judiciary did not displace the original Shari'a courts.

Shari'a justice developed along lines comparable to what happened to the organization of secular justice: greater bureaucratization, more precise legal circumscription of jurisdiction, and the creation of a hierarchy. This development began in 1856.

Until the Qadi’s Ordinance of 1856, the qadis were appointed by the Porte and were part of the Ottoman religious judiciary. This Ordinance recommends the consultation of muftis and 'ulama' . In practice, the sentences of qadis usually were checked by muftis appointed to the courts. Other important decisions were also checked by the mufti of the Majlis al-Ahkdm or by a council of 'ulama' connected with it. It is said that if the local qadi and mufti disagreed, it became customary to submit the case to the authoritative Grand Mufti.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Later, in 1880, the new Shari'a Courts Ordinance introduced the hierarchical judiciary. Through the Ministry of Justice, parties could appeal to the Cairo Shari'a Court against decisions of provincial qadis and ni'ibs. Here, parties could appeal to the Shari’a Court open to the Shaykh al-Azhar and the Grand Mufti, where other people could be added.

Lastly, judges were to consult the muftis appointed to their courts whenever a case was not totally clear to them. If the problem was not solved, the case had to be submitted to the Grand Mufti, whose [[fatwa]] was binding on the qadi. &lt;ref&gt;Peters, Rudolph. “Islamic and Secular Criminal Law in Nineteenth Century Egypt: The Role and Function of the Qadi.” Islamic Law and Society 4, no. 1 (1997): 70–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifications==

A qadi must be an adult.  They must be free, a Muslim, sane, unconvicted of slander and educated in Islamic science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Their performance must be totally congruent with Sharia without using their own interpretation. In a trial in front of a qadi, it is the plaintiff who is responsible for bringing evidence against the defendant in order to have him or her convicted. There are no appeals to the judgements of a qadi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cornell.edu/video/islamic-law-6-qadis-and-muftis|title=Qadis and Muftis - CornellCast|website=CornellCast|language=en|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The qadi must exercise their office in a public place, the chief masjid is recommended, or, in their own house, where the public should have free access.{{sfn|LookLex}}

Qadis must not receive gifts from participants in trials and they must be careful in engaging themselves in trade. Despite the rules governing the office, Muslim history is full of complaints about qadis. It has often been a problem that qadis have been managers of [[waqf]]s, religious endowments.

The qualifications that a qadi must possess are stated in the law, although the law is not uniform on this subject. The minimal requirement upon which all the jurists agree is that a qadi possess the same qualifications as a witness in [[court]], that is, that they be free, sane, adult, trustworthy, and a Muslim. Some require that they also possess the qualifications of a jurist, that is, that they be well versed in the law, while others regard those qualifications as simply preferable, implying that a person may effectively discharge the duties of the office without being well versed in the law. This latter position presupposed that a qadi who is not learned in matters of law would consult those who are before reaching a decision. Indeed, consultation was urged upon the learned qadi as well, since even the learned are fallible and can profit from the views of others. Those consulted did not, however, have a voice in the final decision making. The Islamic court was a strictly one-judge court and the final decision rested upon the shoulders of a single qadi.

==Jurisdiction==

The jurisdiction of a qadi was theoretically coextensive with the scope of the law that he applied. That law was fundamentally a law for Muslims, and the internal affairs of the non-Muslim, or dhimmī, communities living within the Islamic state were left under the jurisdictions of those communities. Islamic law governed dhimmīs only with respect to their relations to Muslims and to the Islamic state. In actual practice, however, the jurisdiction of a qadi was hemmed in by what must be regarded as rival jurisdictions, particularly that of the maẓālim court and that of the [[shurṭah]].

The maẓālim was a court (presided over by the supreme ruler himself or his governor) that heard complaints addressed to it by virtually any offended party. Since Islamic law did not provide for any appellate jurisdiction but regarded the decision of a qadi as final and irrevocable, the maẓālim court could function as a kind of court of appeals in cases where parties complained of unfair decisions from qadis. The maẓālim judge was not bound to the rules of Islamic law (fiqh), nor for that matter was he bound to any body of positive law, but was free to make decisions entirely on the basis of considerations of equity. The maẓālim court thus provided a remedy for the inability of a qadi to take equity freely into account. It also made up for certain shortcomings of Islamic law, for example, the lack of a highly developed law of torts, which was largely due to the preoccupation of the law with breaches of [[contract]]s. In addition, it heard complaints against state officials.

The shurṭah, on the other hand, was the state apparatus responsible for criminal justice. It too provided a remedy for a deficiency in the law, namely the incompleteness and procedural rigidity of its criminal code. Although in theory a qadi exercised a criminal jurisdiction, in practice this jurisdiction was removed from his sphere of competence and turned over entirely to the shurṭah, which developed its own penalties and procedures. What was left to the qadi was a jurisdiction concerned mainly with cases having to do with inheritance, personal status, property, and commercial transactions. Even within this jurisdiction, a particular qadi's jurisdiction could be further restricted to particular cases or types of cases at the behest of the appointing superior.

The principle of delegation of judicial powers not only allowed the supreme ruler to delegate these powers to a qadi; it also allowed qadis to further delegate them to others, and there was in principle no limit to this chain of delegation. All persons in the chain, except for the supreme ruler or his governor, bore the title qadi. Although in theory the appointment of a qadi could be effected by a simple verbal declaration on the part of the appointing superior, normally it was accomplished by means of a written certificate of investiture, which obviated the need for the appointee to appear in the presence of the superior. The appointment was essentially unilateral rather than contractual and did not require acceptance on the part of the appointee in order to be effective. It could be revoked at any time.

==Jewish use==
The Jews living in the Ottoman Empire sometimes used qadi courts to settle disputes. Under the Ottoman system, Jews throughout the Empire retained the formal right to oversee their own courts and apply their own religious law. The motivation for bringing Jewish cases to qadi courts varied. In sixteenth-century Jerusalem, Jews preserved their own courts and maintained relative autonomy. Rabbi [[Samuel de Medina|Samuel De Medina]] and other prominent rabbis repeatedly warned co-religionists that it was forbidden to bring cases to government courts and that doing so undermined Jewish legal authority, which could be superseded only "in matters that pertained to taxation, commercial transactions, and contracts".&lt;ref&gt;Morris S. Goodblatt, ''Jewish Life in Turkey in the XVIth Century as Reflected in the Legal Writings of Samuel de Medina,'' p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the century, Jewish litigants and witnesses participated in Muslim court proceedings when it was expedient, or when cited to do so. Jews who wanted to bring cases against Muslims had to do so in qadi courts, where they found a surprising objectivity. But the different legal status of Jews and Muslims was preserved. Jewish testimony was weighted differently when the testimony was prejudicial to Jews or Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Benton, ''Law and Colonial Cultures: Legal Regimes in World History, 1400-1900'', p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Sri Lanka==
In accordance with section 12 of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, the Judicial Services Commission may appoint any male Muslim of good character and position and of suitable attainments to be a Quazi. The Quazi does not have a permanent courthouse, thus the word "Quazi Court" is not applicable in the current context.  The Quazi can hear the cases anywhere and anytime he wants. Currently most Quazis are laymen.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In accordance with section 15 of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, the Judicial Services Commission may appoint a Board of Quazis, consisting of five male Muslims resident in Sri Lanka, who are of good character and position and of suitable attainments, to hear appeals from the decisions of the Quazis under this Act. The Board of Quazis does not have a permanent courthouse either. Usually an appeal or a revision takes a minimum of two to three years in order to arrive for judgment from the Board of Quazis. The Board of Quazis can start the proceedings at whatever time they want and end the proceedings at whatever time they want.  The Office of the Board of Quazis is situated in Hulftsdorp, Colombo 12.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Women as qadis==
Although the role of qadi has traditionally been restricted to men, women now serve as qadis in many countries, including Egypt, Jordan, Malaysia, Palestine, Tunisia, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cashman|first1=Greer Fay|title=Rivlin and Shaked urge appointment of female Qadis in Shariah Courts|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Rivlin-and-Shaked-urge-appointment-of-female-Qadis-in-Shariah-Courts-444380|accessdate=16 November 2016|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, two women were appointed as qadis by the [[Palestinian Authority]] in the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref name=Prusher&gt;{{cite news|first=Ilene R.|last=Prusher|title=New female judge transforms Islamic court|journal=The Christian Science Monitor|date=May 13, 2009|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2009/0513/p06s20-wome.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[Malaysia]] appointed two women as qadis as well. However, it was decided that as women they may only rule over custody, alimony, and common property issues, not over criminal or divorce cases, which usually make up most of a qadi's work.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite news|first=Pamela|last=Taylor|title=Malaysia appoints first female sharia judges|work=Washington Post|date=August 7, 2010|url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/modernmuslim/2010/08/malaysia_appoints_first_female_sharia_judges.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Indonesia]], there are nearly 100 female qadis.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; In 2017, [[Hana Khatib]] was appointed as the first female qadi in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel appoints country’s first female Sharia judge Hana Khatib |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2017/04/25/Israel-appoints-country-s-first-female-Sharia-judge-Hana-Khatib.html |newspaper=[[Al Arabiya]] |date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is disagreement among Islamic scholars as to whether women are qualified to act as qadis or not.&lt;ref name=Prusher/&gt;

==Local usage==

===Indian subcontinent===
The rulers of Muslim India also used the same institution of the qadi (or kazi). The qadi was given the responsibility for total administrative, judicial and fiscal control over a territory or a town. He would maintain all the civil records as well. He would also retain a small army or force to ensure that his rulings are enforced.

In most cases, the kazi would pass on the title and position to his son, descendent or a very close relative. Over the centuries, this profession became a title within the families, and the power remained within one family in a region. Throughout India and Pakistan, we now find various Kazi families who descended through their famous kazi (qadi) ancestors and retained the lands and position.  Each family is known by the town or city that their ancestors controlled.{{sfn|Qureshi|1942}}
Kazi also living in Rajasthan sekhawati area sikar , churu , and bikaner , hanumangarh . in rajasthan they  follow madariya order of Sufism .now they are make endogamous community .

===Mayotte governorship===
On the island of [[Mayotte]], one of the [[Comoro Islands]], the title ''qadi'' was used for Umar who governed it from 19 November 1835 to 1836 after its conquest by and annexation to the [[Sultanate of Ndzuwani]] ([[Anjouan]]).{{sfn|Worldstatesmen: Mayotte}}

===Songhai Empire===
In the [[Songhai Empire]], criminal justice was based mainly, if not entirely, on Islamic principles, especially during the rule of Askia Muhammad. 
The local qadis were responsible for maintaining order by following ''[[Sharia]]'' law according to the [[Qur'an]]. An additional ''qadi'' was noted as a necessity in order to settle minor disputes between immigrant merchants.{{sfn|Lady Lugard|1997|pp=199-200}}
''Qadis'' worked at the local level and were positioned in important trading towns, such as Timbuktu and Djenné. 
The Qadi was appointed by the king and dealt with common-law misdemeanors according to Sharia law. The Qadi also had the power to grant a pardon or offer refuge.{{sfn|Dalgleish|2005}}

===Spanish derivation===
''[[Alcalde]]'', one of the current [[Spanish language|Spanish]] terms for the [[mayor]] of a town or city, is derived from the [[Arabic]] ''al-qaḍi'' ( ال قاضي), "the judge". In [[Al-Andalus]] a single qadi was appointed to each province. To deal with issues that fell outside of the purview of sharia or to handle municipal administration (such as oversight of the [[police]] and the [[Souk|markets]]) other judicial officers with different titles were appointed by the rulers.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1975|pp=142-143}}

The term was later adopted in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of León|Leon]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] during the eleventh and twelfth centuries to refer to the assistant judges, who served under the principal municipal judge, the ''iudex'' or ''juez''. Unlike the appointed Andalusian ''qadis'', the ''alcaldes'' were elected by an assembly of the municipality's property owners.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1975|pp=269-271}}
Eventually the term came to be applied to a host of positions that combined administrative and judicial functions, such as the ''[[Corregidor (position)|alcaldes mayores]]'', the ''[[Audiencia Real|alcaldes del crimen]]'' and the ''alcaldes de barrio''. The adoption of this term, like many other Arabic ones, reflects the fact that, at least in the early phases of the [[Reconquista]], Muslim society in the Iberian Peninsula imparted great influence on the Christian one. As Spanish Christians took over an increasing part of the Peninsula, they adapted Muslim systems and terminology for their own use.{{sfn|Imamuddin|1981|pp=198-200}}

===Ottoman Empire===
{{main article|Kadı}}
[[File:Zibik.jpg|thumb|180px|An unhappy wife is complaining to the kadı about her husband's impotence. [[Ottoman miniature]].]]
In the Ottoman Empire, qadis were appointed by the ''Veliyu l-Emr''. With the reform movements, secular courts have replaced qadis, but they formerly held wide-ranging responsibilities:
:... During Ottoman period, [qadi] was responsible for the city services. The charged people such as Subasi, Bocekbasi, Copluk Subasisi, Mimarbasi and Police assisted the qadi, who coordinated all the services." [From History of Istanbul Municipality, Istanbul Municipality (in Turkish).]
The role of the Qadi in the Ottoman legal system changed as the Empire progressed through history. The 19th century brought a great deal of political and legal reform to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in an effort to modernize the nation in the face of a shifting power balance in [[Europe]] and the [[Interventionism (politics)|interventions]] in Ottoman territories that followed. In territories such as the [[Khedivate of Egypt]], attempts were made at merging the existing [[Hanafi]] system with [[Napoleonic Code|French-influenced secular laws]] in an attempt to reduce the influence of local Qadis and their rulings.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Rudolf. "Islamic and Secular Criminal Law in Nineteenth Century Egypt: The Role and Function of the
Qadi". ''Islamic Law and Society'' 4, no. 1 (1997):77-78. &lt;/ref&gt; Such efforts were met with mixed success as the Ottoman-drafted reforms often still left fields such as [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] open to a Qadi's rulings based on the previously used Hanafi systems in [[Sharia|sharia-influenced]] courts. &lt;ref&gt;Peters, Rudolf. "Islamic and Secular Criminal Law in Nineteenth Century Egypt: The Role and Function of the
Qadi". ''Islamic Law and Society'' 4, no. 1 (1997):77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Ottoman Empire, a [[Kadiluk]] – the district covered by a kadı – was an administrative subdivision, smaller than a [[Sanjak]].
{{sfn|Malcolm|1994}}

====Expansion of the use of qadis====
As the Empire expanded, so did the legal complexities that were built into the system of administration carried over and were enhanced by the conditions of frontier expansion. In particular, the Islamic empire adapted legal devices to deal with the existence of large populations of non-Muslims, a persistent feature of empire despite incentives for conversion and in part because of institutional protections for communal legal forums. These aspects of the Islamic legal order would have been quite familiar to travelers from other parts of the world. Indeed, Jewish, Armenian, and Christian traders found institutional continuity across Islamic and Western regions, negotiating for and adopting strategies to enhance this resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, Lauren A.; ''Law and Colonial Cultures: Legal Regimes in World History, 1400-1900'', p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina|State Constitution]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (BiH) and the entity Constitutions of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska]] provide for [[freedom of religion]], and the Government generally respects this right in ethnically integrated areas or in areas where government officials are of the majority religion; the state-level Law on Religious Freedom also provides comprehensive rights to religious communities. However, local authorities sometimes restricted the right to worship of adherents of religious groups in areas where such persons are in the minority. 54% of Herzegovinian and Bosnian Muslims consider themselves as "just muslims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/ |title=Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation. The World’s Muslims: Unity and Diversity|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project |date=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government protection of religious freedom declined, especially during the campaign period prior to the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina general election, 2006|October 2006 national elections]], due to selective legal enforcement and the indifference of some government officials. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Government was implementing the State Law on Religious Freedom to protect the rights of religious communities and create a government registry allowing them to establish legal status.

Societal abuses and discrimination based on religious belief and practice persisted. Religious intolerance directly reflected ethnic intolerance because of the virtually indistinguishable identification of ethnicity with religious background. Discrimination against religious minorities occurred in nearly all parts of the country. In some communities local religious leaders and politicians contributed to intolerance and an increase in nationalism through public statements and sermons. A number of illegally constructed religious objects continued to cause ethnic/religious tension and conflict in various communities. Religious symbols were often misused for political purposes.

In a 2009 Gallup poll, 77% of respondents in Bosnia and Herzegovina answered 'yes'  to the question "Is religion an important part of your daily life?", while 21% responded negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/128210/gallup-global-reports.aspx|title=World - Gallup Topic|website=Gallup.com|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a 2017 Pew Research poll, 31% of Bosnian Muslims, 10% of Orthodox and 54% of Catholics attend religious services at least once a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/09154356/Central-and-Eastern-Europe-Topline_FINAL-FOR-PUBLICATION.pdf|format=PDF|title=Final Topline Religious Belief and National Belonging in Central and Eastern Europe |website=Assets.pewresearch.org|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious demography==
{{Culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
In 1800 40% of [[Bosnians]] were [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and nearly half were [[Muslim]]. [[Islam]] peaked in 1600 when three-quarters of Bosnians followed it. [[Bosniaks]] are generally associated with Islam, [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Croats]] with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serbs]] with the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. According to the most recent census, conducted in 2013 and whose results were published in 2016, Muslims today constitute 50.70% of the population; [[Christianity|Christians]], both Catholic and Orthodox, constitute 45.94%; and other groups, including protestants , [[Jews]] and nonreligious persons, constitute 3.36% &lt;ref name=Prelim&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhas.ba/obavjestenja/Preliminarni_rezultati_bos.pdf|title=Preliminary Results of the 2013 Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in Bosnia and Herzegovina|publisher=Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|date=5 November 2013|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although these figures are often disputed by Bosnia's Serb community &lt;ref name=BalkanInsights&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/new-demographic-picture-of-bosnia-finally-revealed-06-30-2016|title=Census Reveals Bosnia's Changed Demography in Bosnia and Herzegovina|publisher=www.BalkanInsight.com|date=30 June 2016|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Jewish community has approximately 1,000 believers and maintains a historic place in society by virtue of centuries of coexistence with other religious communities and its active role in mediating among those communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127302.htm|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina|website=State.gov|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2013}}

The rate of religious observance is relatively low among the traditional religious groups; however, some areas of significantly greater observance exist, such as among Catholic Croats in the [[Herzegovina]] region and among Bosnian Muslims in central Bosnia. For many Bosnian Muslims, religion often serves as a community or ethnic identifier, and religious practice is confined to occasional visits to the [[mosque]] or significant rites of passage such as birth, marriage, and death. Nevertheless, religious leaders from the Muslim, Catholic, and Orthodox communities claimed that all forms of observance were increasing among young persons as an expression of increased identification with their ethnic heritage, in large part due to the national religious revival that occurred as a result of the 1992–95 Bosnian war. Younger believers who grew up in the post-communist period also have more [[Freedom of religion|freedom to practice their religion]] and more access to religious education. Leaders from the three largest religious communities observed that they enjoyed greater support from their believers in rural areas of Bosnia than from those in urban centers such as [[Sarajevo]] or [[Banja Luka]].

[[Ethnic cleansing]] during the [[Bosnian War|1992–95 war]] caused internal migration and [[refugee]] flows, which segregated the population into separate ethnoreligious areas. Increased levels of returns, which peaked in 2002, continued to slow significantly, leaving the majority of Serbian Orthodox adherents living in the [[Republika Srpska|RS]] and the majority of Muslims and Catholics in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Federation]]. Within the Federation, distinct Muslim and Catholic majority areas remain. However, returns of Serbian Orthodox adherents and Muslims in recent years to their prewar homes in western Bosnia and Muslims to their prewar homes in eastern Bosnia have shifted the ethnoreligious composition in both areas. For example, the prewar population of the eastern RS town of [[Bratunac]] was 64% Bosniak. In 1995 the population was almost completely Serb; in 2007, after the return of 6,500 Bosniaks, the population was 38% Bosniak. Similarly, in Prijedor Municipality in the RS, approximately half of the prewar Bosniak population of 49,500 returned, partially reversing the effects of ethnic cleansing. Christians, on the other hand, seem to rarely move back to their old towns; the number of Catholics returning to central Bosnia and the RS, as well as of Serbs returning to the Federation, was negligible.

The Catholic community maintains its Bishops' Conference as an overarching organizational and regional structure, with bishops residing in Mostar, Banja Luka, and Sarajevo; the Franciscan order maintains its strongest presence in central Bosnia near Sarajevo and in Herzegovina. The Serbian Orthodox Church maintains its greatest influence in the RS, with the most influential bishops residing in Banja Luka, Trebinje, and Bijeljina. The Jewish community, like most other small religious groups in Bosnia, including [[Protestants]], has its strongest membership in Sarajevo. There are several small Christian denominations throughout the country. In late 2011, a [[Slavic neopaganism|Rodnover]] association named [[Svaroži Krug]], was established in the nation as a part of the [[Pan-Slavism|panslavic]] [[Praskozorje]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://svarozikrug.weebly.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426071345/http://svarozikrug.weebly.com/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{Main|Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
There are eight muftis (Islamic scholars) located in the major municipalities: [[Sarajevo]], [[Bihać]], [[Travnik]], [[Tuzla]], [[Goražde]], [[Zenica]], [[Mostar]], and [[Banja Luka]]. The more conservative Islamic communities in Bosnia are located in towns such as Travnik, Bocinja/Zavidovici, Tesanj, Maglaj, Bugojno, and Zenica. 38% of Herzegovinian and Bosnian Muslims described themselves as Sunni Muslims while 54% described themselves as just Muslims. However 7% of Muslims either refused to answer which Muslim branch they belonged to, said they belonged to no Muslim branch or said they did not know.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation".

== Status of religious freedom ==
[[File:Church in Međugorje, B-H, June 4th 2007 (2).jpg|thumb|250px|right|The statue and the Marian shrine of [[Međugorje]].]]

=== Legal and policy framework ===
The State Constitution provides for freedom of religion; however, respect for religious freedom declined due to selective legal enforcement and indifference of some government officials, which allowed societal violence and the threat of violence to restrict the ability to worship of adherents of religious groups in areas where they are in the minority. On October 16, 2006, the Ministry of Human Rights and Refugees issued instructions for implementation of the Law on Religious Freedom, which provides for freedom of religion, ensures legal status of churches and religious communities, and prohibits any form of discrimination against any religious community. The law also provides the basis for the establishment of relations between the state and religious communities.

The State Constitution safeguards the rights of the three major ethnic groups (Bosniaks, Serbs, and [[Bosnian Croat|Croats]]), and by extension the three largest religious communities, by providing proportional representation for each group in the government and in the armed forces. As a result of the governmental structure created by the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]], parliamentary seats and most government positions are apportioned specifically to members of the three "constituent peoples." These stipulations often result in constitutional discrimination against "others" and sympathizers of certain religious communities that do not fit neatly into the three groups. During the period covered by this report, members of the Bosnian Jewish and the [[Romani people|Romani]] communities filed separate lawsuits before the European Court of Human Rights to address this discrimination against those considered "others" by the State Constitution. Their claims were not addressed during the reporting period.

Bosnia's state-level government does not officially recognize any religious holy days as an official holiday, and Parliament continued to disagree on a state law on national holidays. Entity and cantonal authorities routinely recognize religious holidays celebrated by members of the area's majority religion, with government and public offices closed on those days. In May 2007 the RS Constitutional Court overruled a Vital National Interest veto by Bosniaks in the RS Council of Peoples, thus enabling the RS National Assembly to pass the Law on Holidays in the RS, which includes observance of RS Day on January 9. Locally observed holy days include Orthodox Easter and Christmas in the RS, Catholic [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]] in Herzegovina, and [[Eid al-Adha|Kurban Bajram]] and [[Eid al-Fitr|Ramadan Bajram]] in [[Sarajevo]] and central Bosnia. On January 27, 2007, [[BiH]] officially marked [[Holocaust]] Day for the first time and commemorated the day with a series of exhibitions, lectures, and discussions throughout the country.

The State Law on Religious Freedom governs religion and the licensing of religious groups, and it provides for the right to freedom of conscience and religion in Bosnia. It grants churches and religious communities legal status and allows them concessions that are characteristic of a nongovernmental organization (NGO). The law also creates a unified register for all religious groups within the Bosnian Ministry of Justice, while the Ministry of Human Rights and Refugees is tasked with documenting violations of religious freedom.

According to the law, any group of 300 adult citizens may apply to form a new church or religious community with a written application to the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Justice will issue a decision within 30 days of the application, and an appeal may be made to the Bosnian Council of Ministers. The law allows minority religious organizations to register legally and operate without unwarranted restrictions. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Alliance of Baptist Churches awaited registration confirmation.

Political parties dominated by a single ethnic group remained powerful and continued to identify closely with the religion associated with their predominant ethnic group. Many political party leaders were former communists who manipulated the core attributes of their particular ethnic group, including religion, to strengthen their credibility with voters. For example, offices of local Bosnian Serb mayors in the RS were often decorated with religious icons, although few officials practiced religion in any meaningful sense. In recent years many Bosnians have turned to their respective religious leaders to fill the void left by politicians, who are perceived by the public as apathetic or corrupt. This enabled religious leaders to play an influential political role, often promoting nationalist platforms, in the 2006 national elections and subsequent government formation as well as in political programs.

The lines dividing politics, ethnic identity, and religion were often blurred, particularly during the period prior to the 2006 national elections and during the public debate over proposed changes to the Bosnian Constitution. Some religious leaders became increasingly political and vocal in this period and used religious sermons and services for political campaign purposes. Political candidates courted religious leaders during the campaign season and were often photographed together in campaign propaganda and media reports. Religious leaders also used their position to influence the election outcome by encouraging their communities to vote for certain individuals or parties. For example, prior to the elections Bosnia's Catholic bishops issued a pastoral letter that was read in every Catholic church on July 2, 2006, in place of the traditional Sunday sermon. The letter reminded believers of the importance of their vote and encouraged Croat parties to form coalitions so that no Croat vote would be wasted. It also urged them to oppose U.S.-brokered constitutional amendments "through which war horrors would be legalized and the Croat people marginalized." During the preelection period, the media and others often criticized the head of the BiH Islamic community for his appearance at public events with presidential candidate Haris Silajdzic and for his public statements calling on Silajdzic to "write a new constitution" so Bosniaks would honor him as they do wartime president Alija Izetbegovic.

The State Law on Religious Freedom reaffirms the right of every citizen to religious education. The law calls for an official representative of the various churches or religious communities to be responsible for teaching religious studies in all public and private preschools, primary schools, and universities throughout Bosnia. These individuals are employees of the municipality in which they teach but have been accredited by the religious body governing the curriculum. However, the law was not always fully implemented, particularly in segregated school systems or where there was political resistance from nationalist party officials at the municipal level. During the period covered by this report, the entity, cantonal, and municipal governments gave varying levels of financial support to the four traditional religious communities - Muslim, Serbian Orthodox, Catholic, and Jewish. Religious communities tended to receive the most funding in areas where their adherents were in the majority.

Religious education is largely decentralized, as is the education system generally. Public schools offer religious education classes, but with some exceptions, schools generally offer religious instruction only in the municipality's majority religion. By law, students (or their parents, in the case of primary school students) may choose not to attend the classes. However, students of the majority religion and sometimes also of minority religious groups faced pressure from teachers and peers to attend religious instruction, and most did so. Children who are reluctant to be singled out as different from their classmates often attend instruction of the majority religion, even if it is not the religion they practice at home. If a sufficient number of students of minority religious group(s) attend a particular school (20 in the RS, 15 in the Federation), the school must organize religion classes on their behalf. However, in rural areas there are usually no qualified religious representatives available to teach religious studies to the handful of minority students. Minority students are often widely scattered across remote areas, making it logistically difficult to provide classes even when a teacher is available. In the Federation's five cantons with Bosniak majorities, schools offer Islamic religious instruction as a 2-hour-per-week elective course. In cantons with Croat majorities, all Croat students attend the "elective" 1-hour weekly Catholic religion course for primary and middle schools. Use of religious symbolism by the majority group in art classes, such as minority children in Bosniak majority areas being tasked to draw mosques or those in Christian majority areas being asked to draw crosses, continued to be a problem.

Parents may enroll their children in private schools for religious reasons. In Sarajevo, [[Tuzla]], [[Travnik]], [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]], [[Mostar]], and [[Bihać]], Muslim students may attend [[Madrasah|madrassahs]]. These Islamic secondary schools provide training for students who want to become religious officials as well as general education to prepare students for university studies. There is one Serbian Orthodox secondary school in Foca. In Sarajevo, Tuzla, Travnik, Zepce, Banja Luka, Bihac, and Zenica, students may attend Catholic school centers. Although primarily Croat, these schools are open to students of other ethnicities and religious groups. Some of these centers have both primary and secondary schools, and although the principals are priests, the majority of teachers are not religious officials. The curriculum is a combination of Bosniak and Croat curricula used in the Federation.

Facilities also exist for the three largest religious communities at the university level. The Faculty of Islamic Sciences is located in Sarajevo, the Serbian Orthodox Seminary in Foca in the RS, and two Catholic theology faculties (one run by the Franciscans and one run by the diocese) in Sarajevo.

=== [[Freedom of religion|Restrictions on religious freedom]] ===
Weak administrative and judicial systems effectively restricted religious freedom and posed major obstacles to safeguarding the rights of religious minorities. In some cases local governments made improvements in protecting religious freedom; however, serious problems remained, including an atmosphere in which violations of religious freedom occurred. For example, local police rarely made arrests in cases of vandalism against religious buildings or violence and harassment against religious officials or believers. Successful prosecutions were extremely rare. Local police frequently alleged that juveniles, intoxicated individuals, or mentally unstable persons were responsible for these attacks.

Lack of uniform protection posed obstacles to safeguarding minority rights, despite improved police and judicial protection for minorities in some parts of the country. Ethnic quotas set for the recruitment of new officers into police academies were observed, but reforms intended to establish a countrywide effective, professional, multi-ethnic police force failed. Police forces as well as entity and local governments frequently allowed or encouraged an atmosphere in which violations of religious freedom could take place. In some cases the reluctance of police and prosecutors to aggressively investigate and prosecute crimes against religious minorities remained a major obstacle to safeguarding the rights of religious minorities. The appropriation of religious symbols and buildings for political purposes in combination with restrictions on religious services and ceremonies had a negative impact on inter-religious dialogue and inter-ethnic relations in many communities. Authorities of the majority religious or ethnic group often discriminated against those of the minority group in matters related to municipal services, including security and education.

Governments at the local level restricted religious services and ceremonies. In the eastern RS municipality of Bratunac, the Serb majority municipal assembly repeatedly denied a permit for the Islamic community to build a cemetery and memorial on its property surrounding a downtown mosque. Bosniak organizers hoped to bury 98 identified victims of a 1992 massacre in Bratunac in which more than 600 persons, including the local imam, were killed. Organizers planned to hold the burials at the mosque on May 12, 2007, the 15th anniversary of the massacre, but Serb veterans' associations and local residents protested the planned burials. The mayor and assembly denied the building permit, claiming that the proposed cemetery and memorial had not been envisioned in the town's urban plan. After more than a year of repeated requests and appeals from Bosniak organizers, the RS Government and the international community intervened, and the parties reached a last-minute agreement that enabled the burials to take place at a different location on the planned date.

Religious officials of Sarajevo's minority populations complained of discrimination by local authorities regarding the use of religious property, obstructionism in municipal services, and daily harassment such as the frequent towing of vehicles parked near churches and church offices.

In September 2006 in the eastern RS town of Zvornik, the Saint Sava primary school launched the new school year with a religious ceremony chaired by a Serbian Orthodox priest in the presence of more than 100 Bosniak students and parents. The incident received strong condemnation from the Islamic community, Bosniak associations, and the RS Minister of Education and Culture, who called the decision "inappropriate." However, school officials saw no problem with the event and indicated that it was a 15-year tradition to begin the school year in this manner and that attendance was not obligatory.

There were a number of controversial and highly politicized cases involving the illegal construction of religious buildings or monuments on private or government-owned land. In these cases the buildings or monuments were built to send a political message to minority believers about the dominance of the majority ethnic and religious group in that area, creating ethnic tensions and impeding the process of reconciliation.

An illegally constructed Serbian Orthodox church remained on the land of a Bosniak returnee in the town of Konjevic Polje in the eastern RS, despite the RS Ministry of Urban Planning's 2004 decision that the church should be removed. On September 11, 2006, for the second consecutive year, the local Orthodox priest celebrated Mass in the church, which was attended by a large number of attendees singing songs and wearing traditional clothing. Local police were present, and there was no violence. In June 2007 RS and Serbian Orthodox Church officials agreed in principle to relocate the church but had not found an alternate location by the end of the period covered by this report. A wooden Serbian Orthodox church unlawfully built on private Bosniak owned land in the town of Kotorsko continued to be the source of legal and ethnic conflict. Although deadlines were set by authorities for removal of the church, no action had been taken by the end of the period covered by this report.

The presence of a large stone cross and cement foundations for the eventual addition of more crosses in the ethnically divided town of Stolac in Herzegovina also remained contentious. In 2004 Federation authorities ordered the removal of the cross and foundations; however, the removal was delayed pending the outcome of a 2004 lawsuit on the legality of the Federation Government's decision. In September 2006 the Federation Constitutional Court upheld the constitutionality of the law, and the Federation Ministry of Spatial Planning was able again to launch an initiative for removal of the cross and foundations. While the Federation Ministry of Spatial Planning had the legal authority to undertake such an initiative, it was reluctant to do so out of concern that the action would increase inter-ethnic tensions during the election year. In May 2007 members of a Bosniak NGO illegally destroyed the additional foundations, but the cross remained.

Traditional religious communities all had extensive claims for restitution of property that the communist government of the former Yugoslavia nationalized after World War II. The State Law on Religious Freedom provides religious communities the right to restitution of expropriated property throughout the country "in accordance with the law." A special multi-ethnic restitution commission completed its mandate and delivered a draft restitution law to the Council of Ministers in early 2007 for approval. However, as of mid-2007 no action had been taken, and many believed that the law would not be passed without changes. In the absence of any state legislation specifically governing restitution, return of former religious properties continued on an ad hoc basis at the discretion of municipal officials but was usually completed only in favor of the majority group.

Many officials used property restitution cases as a tool of political patronage, rendering religious leaders dependent on politicians to regain property taken from religious communities. Other unresolved restitution claims were politically and legally complicated. For example, the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] continued to seek the return of the building that housed the University of Sarajevo's Economic Faculty and compensation for the land on which the state parliament building is located. The Jewish and Muslim communities also asserted historic claims to many commercial and residential properties in [[Sarajevo]]. The [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] community maintained a large number of similar claims in [[Banja Luka]].

In May 2007 the Islamic community began proceedings against the RS city of Banja Luka seeking damages of approximately $1.1 million (1.5 million Bosnian convertible marks) for the wartime destruction of all mosques in the city. The Islamic community filed the original lawsuit in 2000 but began proceedings again when an out-of-court settlement failed because the city would not make the requested admission of guilt.

During the period covered by this report, the Federation municipality of Travnik partially complied with a 2003 decision by the Human Rights Chamber (renamed the Human Rights Commission of the Constitutional Court) ordering the municipal government to relocate a public school housed in a building formerly owned by the Catholic archdiocese. The municipality returned half the building to the archdiocese for use as part of its Catholic school center. However, the other half remained in use as a public school. The court ordered the public school to move out of the building by July 1, 2006, but by that date authorities had not allocated funding for a new school building, and the building remained in use as a public school.

Minority religious communities also encountered difficulty in obtaining permits for new churches and mosques. The Catholic Church continued to seek permission, first solicited in 2000, to build a new church in the Sarajevo neighborhood of Grbavica, but complained that the local authorities, a Bosniak majority, refused to grant the permit.

There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country, or of forced religious conversion.

== Societal abuses and discrimination ==

There were a reports of [[societal abuses]] or [[discrimination]] based on religious belief or practice, and prominent societal leaders did not always take positive steps to promote religious freedom. Compared to the previous reporting period, attacks on religious objects and religious officials increased significantly, particularly in the campaign months before the national elections, during which nationalist rhetoric employed by certain political parties heightened religious and ethnic tensions.

Minority religious buildings, clerics, and communities bore the brunt of retaliation for discrimination and violence perpetrated by members of their religious/ethnic groups in areas where those groups constituted the majority. Because they are powerful symbols of religious identification and ethnicity, clerics and religious buildings were favored targets. Most religious leaders severely criticized violence and nationalism against their own group but could be less vocal in condemning acts against members of other groups. Those in the majority religious or ethnic group had an advantage in employment opportunities.

Discrimination remained a serious problem in the RS, particularly in the eastern part, and in Croat-dominated areas of the Federation; discrimination against non-Muslims appeared to worsen in some Bosniak-majority areas where more conservative Islamic communities resided. Sarajevo, the Bosniak-majority capital, preserved in part its traditional role as a multiethnic city; however, complaints of discrimination persisted. Some non-Muslims reported feeling isolated and marginalized in the capital.

The number of incidents against religious symbols, clerics, and property in all three ethnic majority areas increased, especially during the period immediately prior to the October 2006 national elections. Local police generally did not conduct serious investigations into such incidents. For example, in July 2006 unidentified perpetrators sprayed gunfire into a Muslim cemetery in Trebinje, damaging several tombstones. In the same month and city, unidentified persons also threw an explosive device at the home of a Bosniak returnee. When police concluded that the attacks were the pranks of local youngsters, the local Muslim community called for the dismissal of the police chief for not performing a full investigation. Similar reports of local police assigning blame for these incidents on pranksters, drunkards, or the mentally unstable were frequent.

There were a number of acts of violence and vandalism against Muslim religious targets throughout the country. In October 2006 a rocket-propelled grenade destroyed a large portion of the Jasenica Mosque near Mostar; this was the most severe attack since the end of the war. The Jasenica Mosque became a source of controversy when local Croats objected to its reconstruction on grounds that its new design violated a law permitting only reconstruction in the same style as the original prewar building. City officials ordered removal of the mosque, but the order had not been carried out before the attack. In September 2006 the Carsijska Mosque in Bosanska Dubica was also repeatedly vandalized. In August 2006 an explosive device was detonated at the grave of former president Alija Izetbegovic, destroying his tombstone and leaving a large crater at the grave.

Serbian Orthodox sites were also targets of vandalism. In December 2006 unknown individuals stoned the Orthodox church in Kakanj, and in November 2006 several gravestones in the Orthodox cemetery in the village of Mioci were damaged. In August 2006 unidentified persons wrote threatening, anti-Serb graffiti on the Serbian Orthodox church in Petrovo. Also in August unknown perpetrators damaged several tombstones and broke a large number of vases at the Orthodox cemetery in Ljubinici and broke windows and damaged the entrance door of the Orthodox church in Gracanica.

Catholic religious objects were also the targets of vandalism. In September 2006 unknown persons broke the glass on the entrance door to a Catholic church in the Sarajevo neighborhood of Grbavica. The church was the subject of controversy because the Catholic community had requested a permit to build a new church, which local authorities had yet to approve. Also in September, in the Orasje neighborhood near Tuzla, persons damaged the doors and windows of the cemetery chapel and moved religious statues.

Protestant churches also were vandalized. On Easter Sunday 2007 several churches in Sarajevo were burglarized and documents about the congregation, specifically the lists of those who had been baptized, were stolen. Some churches faced repeated break-ins and complained that the local police made no efforts to find those responsible but instead intimidated church officials by calling them in for lengthy interrogations.

The leaders of the four traditional religious communities participated in the Interreligious Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which continued to operate despite occasional significant disagreements and funding constraints.

The Catholic and Orthodox bishops of the country continued to meet regularly to discuss matters of mutual concern. During the week of ecumenical dialogue in April 2007, the head of the BiH Catholic Church, Vinko Puljic, led a service at Sarajevo's Orthodox cathedral, and the head of the BiH Serbian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Nikolaj, held a service at Sarajevo's Catholic cathedral.

The bishop of Mostar-Duvno-Trebinje-Mrkan Bishopric, Ratko Peric, met with the mufti of Mostar, Seid Effendi Smajkic, for the first time since the end of the war, and during Bajram Bishop Peric extended congratulations to Muslims in the region. Both events helped to reopen channels of communication in the country's most segregated city.

In September 2006 Serbian Orthodox Bishop Vasilije and then-Minister for Human Rights and Refugees Mirsad Kebo negotiated to remove a Serbian Orthodox church built on the site of a destroyed mosque in the eastern RS village of Divic. Although these negotiations marked a positive resolution to a controversial and longstanding conflict, the church had not been removed by the end of the period covered by this report.

'''Rustam I''' ({{lang-fa|رستم}}), was the ninth ruler of the [[Bavand dynasty]] from 867 to 896. He was the successor and son (or grandson) of [[Qarin I]].

== Biography ==
Like his father, Rustam opposed the [[Zaydids|Zaydi rulers]] of [[Tabaristan]], and in 879, revolted against them.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;Madelung (1993), pp. 595–597&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madelung207"&gt;Madelung (1975), p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Rustam then seized [[Qumis, Iran|Kumis]] from [[Qasim ibn Ali]], and urged [[Ahmad ibn Abdallah al-Khujistani]], the ruler of [[Nishapur]], to invade [[Tabaristan]].

Ahmad ibn Abdallah accepted, and captured [[Gurgan]], while Rustam occupied [[Astarabad]], but a sudden attack by the Zaydi emir [[Hasan ibn Zayd]] forced Rustam to flee to the mountains; Hasan's brother [[Muhammad ibn Zayd]] chased Rustam and forced to accept his suzerainty and not raise an army any more. After the death of Hasan in 884, Rustam supported Abu'l-Husayn Ahmad ibn Muhammad as the successor of Hasan ibn Zayd.&lt;ref name="MadelungBavand"&gt;Madelung (1984), pp. 747–753&lt;/ref&gt; However, Muhammad ibn Zayd managed to defeat Abu'l-Husayn after ten months, and then attacked Rustam and forced him to flee Tabaristan. Rustam then took refuge with the [[Saffarid]] emir [[Amr ibn al-Layth]]. With Saffarid mediation, Rustam was allowed to return to his domains.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;
 
Like his brother, Muhammad tried to expand his domain by military means, and campaigns occupied a large part of his reign. In August 885 he tried to capture [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]] from its Turkish ruler Asategin, but was driven back. [[Rafi' ibn Harthama]], a former [[Tahirid]] soldier, used the opportunity to occupy Gurgan, but Muhammad recovered control of the province as soon as Rafi' departed it.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; In 888 or 889, Muhammad once again attacked Rustam, but the latter managed to once again flee, and this time he sought aid from Rafi'. Rafi', along with Rustam, launched a major invasion of the Zaydi domains and conquered most of them, forcing Muhammad, like his brother before him, to seek shelter in the mountain fortresses of the western districts. Muhammad also gained the support of Jostan ibn Wahsudan, the [[Justanid]] ruler of [[Daylam]]. With his aid, Muhammad engaged in constant fighting with Rafi', but was unable to recover his realm. Eventually, Rafi' struck a peace with Jostan, and the Daylamites too withdrew.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; At this point, Muhammad's fortunes changed, with the accession of a new Caliph, [[al-Mu'tadid]], on the [[Abbasid]] throne in 892. Fearful of Rafi's power, the Caliph stripped him of the governorship of [[Khurasan]] and gave it to his rival, the Saffarid Amr ibn al-Layth. In response, Rafi' concluded a peace with Muhammad, returned Tabaristan (but not Gurgan) to him and even pledged allegiance to the Zaydi cause. Rustam, after hearing about Rafi's alliance with his rival Muhammad, then allied with Amr ibn al-Layth.

In 896, Rafi' lured Rustam to Astarabad, where he had him tortured and killed.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madelung207"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MadelungBavand"/&gt; Rustam I was then succeeded by his son [[Sharwin II]].

'''''Salvation!'''''  (also known as '''''Salvation!: Have You Said Your Prayers Today?''''') is a 1987 American [[black comedy]] film directed by [[Scott B and Beth B|Beth B]], and starring [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Exene Cervenka]], and [[Stephen McHattie]]. The film is a [[parody]] of [[televangelism]], and was released right after the real-life [[Jim Bakker]] and [[Jimmy Swaggart]] scandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|authorlink=Vincent Canby|author=Canby, Vincent|title=Salvation Have You Said Your Prayers Today (1987) TV EVANGELISM IS SATIRIZED IN 'SALVATION!'|date=May 31, 1987|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9907EFDF153AF932A05756C0A961948260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released on [[VHS]],{{cn|date=September 2017}} but not as yet on [[DVD]].

==Plot==
McHattie plays [[Reverend]] Randall, a [[Staten Island]]-based televangelist who has been bilking his flock and secretly watches [[pornography]] while he is rehearsing his [[sermon]]s in his stately home.  Cervenka plays Rhonda Stample, a [[Born again Christianity|born again Christian]] who watches his programs and regularly sends him money, to the irritation of Rhonda's non-believer husband, Jerome ([[Viggo Mortensen]]).
Shortly after Jerome loses his factory job, his sister in-law Lenore ([[Dominique Davalos]]) comes to Rev. Randall's home in a rainstorm, claiming car trouble. He reluctantly lets her in, and the two take turns seducing and then retreating from each other, until they finally engage in violent lovemaking. Jerome shows up later that evening, along with two boorish neighbors, and beat him for what they believe is an unwanted encounter with Lenore. All of them contemplate the possibilities of [[blackmail]] against him with a [[sex scandal]], but Randall manages to escape his home. That morning, he is picked up hitchhiking by Rhonda, who pitches him on the notion of bringing her into his ministry. In order to avert the intentions of her husband and sister, he agrees to her idea.
Later, Rhonda's addition to Randall's program has become a huge success, with Jerome, Lenore, and the neighbors all enjoying a higher standard of living. But Rhonda gets drunk with power, and makes increasing demands on Randall, first to boot all the other parties from their ministry, and then for a bigger share of their proceeds. Randall resists the latter option, but ultimately gives in. The film finishes with Rhonda performing a heavy-metal inspired song of faith, "Destroy All Evil", with imagery associated with tropes of the musical style.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7724">{{Zoroastrianism}}
'''Saoshyant''' (Avestan: 𐬯𐬀𐬊𐬳𐬌𐬌𐬀𐬧𐬝 saoš́iiaṇt̰) is the [[Avestan language]] expression that literally means "one who brings benefit", and which is used in several different ways in [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] scripture and tradition. In particular, the expression is the proper name of ''the'' Saoshyant, an eschatological saviour figure who bring about ''[[Frashokereti]]'', the final renovation of the world in which evil is finally destroyed. The term was contracted to 'Soshans' in Zoroastrian tradition, and came to apply to three saviour figures that progressively bring about the final renovation.

==In scripture==
In the [[Gathas]], the most sacred hymns of Zoroastrianism, believed to have been composed by [[Zoroaster]] himself, the term is used as a common noun to refer to the prophet's own mission and to his community of followers, who "bring benefit" to humanity. The common noun also appears in the Younger Avesta (e.g. ''Yasna'' 61.5&lt;!--Boyce 235--&gt;), where it generically denotes religious leaders, including Zoroaster (e.g. ''Yasna'' 46.3)&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_234"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another common noun ''[[airyaman]]'' "member of community" is an epithet of these ''saoshyant''s. In contrast, the standing epithet of the saviour figure(s) is ''astvat-''ә''r''ә''ta'' "embodying righteousness,"&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_282"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=282}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which has ''arta/[[asha]]'' "Truth" as an element of the name.&lt;ref name="Dhalla_1938_165"&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1938|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These saviours are those who follow Ahura Mazda's teaching "with acts inspired by asha" (''Yasna'' 48.12).

'Saoshyant' first appears as a proper name in the Younger Avesta,&lt;ref name="Dhalla_1938_108"&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1938|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly so in ''Yasht'' 13.129 where it is used in the singular and where Astvat-ereta develops into an alternate name of the Saoshyant. The singular also appears in ''Yasna'' 59.1 where [[Verethragna]] is said to be Saoshyant's weapon in overcoming resistance. A plural form appears for instance in ''Yasht'' 17.1 where [[Ashi]]&amp;mdash;the divinity of "recompense"&amp;mdash;is described to give the Saoshyants the power of "making wonderful" (''[[frashokereti|frasho.kereti]]''). The term may also be rendered as "Renovation" and can be translated etymologically as "[[Haoma|juicy-making]]". &lt;!-- 'frašō.kərəti' as "making wonderful" is now standard (cf Boyce 231, and n17). Older texts have a different translation, "making reborn" or some such.--&gt;&lt;!--Well Boyce is not everyone, so it seems a little early to speak of a "standard". Skjærvø in his paedagogical "Introduction to Zoroastrianism" (on http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/Zoroastrianism/) says the term is "commonly rendered" as "Renovation", can be translated etymologically as "[[Haoma|juicy-making]]", and he himself chooses to use "perfectioning".--&gt;

The role of the Saoshyant, or Astvat-ereta, as a future saviour of the world is briefly described in Yasht 19.88-96, where it is stated that he will achieve the Frashokereti, that he will make the world perfect and immortal, and evil and [[Druj]] will disappear. He is identified as the son of Vîspa.taurwairî and it is stated that he will come forth from Lake Kansaoya/Kansava and will carry the same weapon [[Verethragna]] that a number of Iranian epic heroes and kings have used in the past against various demonic foes. [[Haurvatat]], [[Ameretat]], the righteous [[Haoma|Dūraoša]] and other similar entities will be his companions and together, they will vanquish the evil creations of [[Angra Mainyu]].

==In tradition==
Already alluded to in scripture (e.g. ''Yasht'' 19.88-96, see above), but only properly developed in the 9th&amp;ndash;12th century texts, is the role of the Saoshyant during the final renovation. In these [[Middle Persian]] texts, the name is contracted to 'Soshans' or similar ('Sōshans' in living Zoroastrianism).

Those medieval works of Zoroastrian tradition envision three future saviours, each of them a 'Soshans'/Saoshyant, with one for the end of each thousand-year period that comprise the last 3,000 years of the world (these three millennia follow the 'millennium of Zoroaster'). According to the tradition (found e.g. in the ''[[Jamasp Namag]]''), the first Saoshyant will be named (H)Ushedar, the second (H)Ushedarmah and the third will again be ''the'' Saoshyant, who will lead humanity in the final battle against evil. The medieval works also transmit a tradition in which the three future saviours are mythologised as born of maidens, conceived while their mothers bathed in a lake that miraculously preserved the seed of the prophet Zoroaster himself. 

The story of the Saoshyant's conception and early life are described in ''[[Denkard]]'' 7.10.15ff as follows: Thirty years before the decisive final battle&lt;!-- 7.10.15--&gt;, a maiden named Eredat-fedhri ("Victorious Helper") and whose nickname is "Body-maker"&lt;!--.15--&gt; will enter a lake (in Yasht 19.92, this is "Lake Kansava"). Sitting in the water, the girl, who has "not associated with men"&lt;!--.18--&gt; will receive "victorious knowledge."&lt;!--actually ''Yasht'' 19.92--&gt; Her son, when born, will not know nourishment from his mother, his body will be sun-like, and the "royal glory" of the [[Khvarenah]] will be with him. Then, for the next 57 years he will subsist on only vegetables (17 years), then only water (30 years) and then for the final 10 years only on "spiritual food."

The events of the final renovation are described in the ''[[Bundahishn]]'' (30.1ff): In the final battle with evil, the [[yazata]]s [[Airyaman]] and [[Atar]] will "melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and it will be upon the earth like a river" (''Bundahishn'' 34.18) but the righteous (i.e. the ''[[ashavan]]'') will not be harmed. Eventually, [[Ahura Mazda]] will triumph, and his agent Saoshyant will resurrect the dead, whose bodies will be restored to eternal perfection, and whose souls will be cleansed and reunited with God. Time will then end, and ''asha'' and immortality will thereafter be everlasting.

==In the Bahá'í Faith==
{{main|Bahá'í Faith and Zoroastrianism}}
Bahá'í tradition considers the prophecies of the Saoshyant (Bahá'i 'Soshyosh') to have been fulfilled in the person of [[Bahá'u'lláh]],{{sfn|Kazemi|2013|p=104}}{{sfn|Khianra|Stiles|2000|p=368}} while the other two Soshans of Zoroastrian tradition are interpreted as referring to [[Muhammad]] and the [[Báb]] respectively.{{sfn|Khianra|Stiles|2000|p=368}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8080">"'''Servant of God'''" is a term used for individuals by various [[religion]]s for people believed to be pious in the faith's tradition. In the [[Catholic Church]], it designates an individual who is being investigated by the Church for possible canonization as a [[saint]]. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], this term is used to refer to any Eastern Orthodox Christian.{{NoteTag|See e.g. the standard use of "servant of God" or, in Greek, "δούλος του Θεού" in the [https://archive.org/details/ServiceBookOfHolyOrthodoxChurchByHapgood Orthodox rites] of baptism, marriage, or communion; the female form, in English, is sometimes rendered "handmaid of God".}} The Arabic name ''[[Abdullah (name)|Abdullah]]''&lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=GZJ1O9Xe68EC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=%22Abdullah%22+%22Servant+of+God%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EFgReusigJ&amp;sig=cqHXM5CnaaT3RxDQi2VNJTQF-0w&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=ERM1SuLYIp26jAfWuumBCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5 ''The Vision of Islam''.

==Christianity==
===Bible===
The expression "servant of God" appears eight times in the [[Bible]], the first four in the [[Old Testament]], the last four in the [[New Testament|New]]. The Hebrew Bible refers to "[[Moses]] the servant of [[Elohim]]" (עֶֽבֶד הָאֱלֹהִ֛ים ''‘eḇeḏ-hā’ĕlōhîm''; {{bibleref|1 Chronicles|6:49|9}}, {{bibleref|2 Chronicles|24:9|9}}, {{bibleref|Nehemiah|10:29|9}}, and {{bibleref|Daniel|9:11|9}}). {{bibleref|Judges|2:8|9}} refers to [[Joshua]] as ''‘eḇeḏ [[Yahweh]]'' (עֶ֣בֶד יְהוָ֑ה).

The New Testament also describes Moses in this way in {{bibleref|Revelation|15:3|9}} (τοῦ δούλου τοῦ Θεοῦ, ''tou doulou tou Theou'').  [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] calls himself "&lt;U&gt;a&lt;/U&gt; servant of God" in {{bibleref|Titus|1:1|9}} (δοῦλος Θεοῦ, ''doulos Theou''), while [[Epistle of James|James]] calls himself "&lt;U&gt;a&lt;/U&gt; servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ" (θεοῦ καὶ κυρίου Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ δοῦλος, ''Theou kai Kyriou Iēsou Christou doulos'') in {{bibleref|James|1:1|9}}. {{bibleref|2 Peter|2:16|9}} describes "servants of God" (Θεοῦ δοῦλοι, ''Theou douloi'') being free to act within the bounds of God's will.  Following grammatical conventions established in the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]], the word "servant" is never capitalized or used as a title of nobility. ("The servant is not greater than his lord.")&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|John|13:16|9}}; {{bibleref|John|15:20|9}}; {{bibleref|Matthew|25:21|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic Church===
"Servant of God" is an expression used for a member of the [[Catholic Church]] whose life and works are being investigated in consideration for official recognition by the [[Pope]] and the Catholic Church as a saint in [[beatific vision|Heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E7D61E31F931A25751C1A9629C8B63 "Pressing Sainthood for a Beloved Archbishop"]. (12 December 2004) by Marek Fuchs. ''The New York Times''. Accessed 28 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050929_saraiva-martins-beatif_en.html CONGREGATION FOR THE CAUSES OF SAINTS: NEW PROCEDURES IN THE RITE OF BEATIFICATION]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Servant of God" ({{lang-la|Servus Dei}}) should not be confused with ''[[Servus Servorum Dei]]'' (Servant of the Servants of God), one of the titles of the [[Pope]].

The term ''Servant of God'' is used in the first of the four steps in the canonization process. The next step is being declared ''[[Venerable]]'', upon a decree of heroism or [[martyrdom]] by the honored. That is followed by [[beatification]], with the title of ''[[Beatification|Blessed]]''. After the confirmation of miracles resulting from the intercession of the honored, the final step is [[canonization]], where the honored would receive the title of ''[[Saint]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/john_paul_ii_declared_venerable_moves_one_step_closer_to_sainthood "John Paul II declared Venerable, moves one step closer to sainthood"].

''Saipan Tribune''. Retrieved 28 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The process for [[canonization]] is under the jurisdiction of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]].

An incomplete list can be found in the [[List of Servants of God]] and [[Candidates for sainthood]].

''Servant of God'' is not considered a canonical title in a strict sense by the Catholic Church (as for instance ''Venerable'' or ''Blessed'' are), but only a technical term used in the process of beatification. Hence, any of the faithful can be named a "Servant of God" in a larger frame of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Congregation for the Causes of Saints|Congregatio de Causis Sanctorum]] – Vincenzo Criscuolo, Daniel Ols, Robert J. Sarno (ed.), ''Le Cause dei Santi. Sussidio per lo Studium'', [[Libreria Editrice Vaticana]], 3rd edition, Rome 2014, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
A [[guru]] or sat guru in various traditions of [[Hinduism]] is given the name [[Dasa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2000/09/07/stories/10070906.htm Able exponent of Dwaita philosophy] Thursday, September 07, 2000. [[The Hindu]]&lt;/ref&gt; or "servant of God".

In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], ''tontai'', ''dasa'', servant, or "slave," commonly are used to refer to devotees of Vishnu or Krishna.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-532639-3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven P.

'''''Talmid Chacham''''' ({{lang-he-n|תלמיד חכם}}, "student of a sage", or {{lang-he-n|תלמיד חכמים}}, lit. "student of sages"&lt;ref&gt;The term as translated by Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih]] from the Pirush HaMishnah of [[Maimonides]] ([[Mossad HaRav Kook]] edition)&lt;/ref&gt; ; pl. ''Talmidei Chachamim''; in [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] ''Talmidh Ḥakham'' and ''Talmidhe Ḥakhamim'') is an honorific title given to one well versed in [[Jewish law]], in effect, a [[Torah]] scholar. 

==Expectations of a talmid chacham==

A ''Talmid Chacham'' is expected to uphold his rank and not to compromise his dignity. As in the case of a king, he is not permitted to allow any one to omit the performance of any public act of reverence due to him, to the effect that the ''Talmid Chacham'' acts as a facilitator, because in him the Halakha is honored or slighted.

A ''Talmid Chacham'' must avoid six acts: to go abroad in perfumed garments; to walk alone at night; to wear shabby shoes; to converse with a woman while on the street (even if she is his wife); to sit in the society of an ignoramus; to be the last to enter the [[beth midrash]].&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Berachot 43b&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to association with an ignoramus, the Talmud says: "The ''Talmid Chacham'' is first likened by the ignoramus to a vase of gold; if he converses with him, he is looked upon as a vase of silver; and if he accepts a service from him, he is regarded as a vase of earth."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]])&lt;/ref&gt; Among the privileges of the ''Talmid Chacham'' is the right of declining to present himself as a witness in suits concerning money transactions before a judge who is his inferior in knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch Hoshen Mishpat 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Talmid Chacham'' was expected to be familiar with all branches of Torah study, and even all branches of general human learning. "He who understands [[astronomy]]," says [[Yochanan bar Nafcha|Rabbi Yochanan]], "and does not pursue the study of it, of that man it is written: 'But they regard not the work of the Lord, neither consider the operation of His hands'" ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]]). Rabbi Yochanan also says that only someone able to answer all Halakhic questions, even those which deal only with the insignificant treatise [[Kallah]], is a ''Talmid Chacham'' worthy to be appointed leader of a community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 114a&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with this view, some later rabbinical authorities assert that in modern times no one deserves to be called by this epithet.&lt;ref&gt;Knesset Hagedolah on Yoreh Deah 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles with which the ''Talmid Chacham'' must live are enumerated in the first chapter of the work ''[[Derekh Eretz Zutta]]'', opening with the following sentence: "The way of the wise is to be modest, humble, alert, and intelligent; to endure injustice; to make himself beloved of men; to be gracious in his interactions even with subordinates; to avoid wrong-doing; to judge each man according to his deeds; to act according to the motto 'I take no pleasure in the good things of this world, seeing that life here below is not my portion.' Wrapped in his mantle, he sits at the feet of the wise; no one can detect anything unseemly in him; he puts relevant questions, and gives suitable answers."

==Attitudes toward the talmid chacham==

Prizing Torah knowledge above all worldly goods, ''Talmidei Chachamim'' in [[Judaism|Jewish]] society were afforded many privileges and prerogatives as well as duties. In the [[Middle Ages]] the ''Talmid Chacham'' was consulted by the Jewish community not only in spiritual matters, but also in worldly affairs. Even when he held no official position in the community, he supervised religious activities, determined the time and form of [[Jewish services|prayers]], verified weights and measures, etc. To enable him to devote himself entirely to study, Jewish legislation exempted him from the payment of taxes and from performing any specific duties.&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 243&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel]] is quoted as having said "[Every] person should always conduct himself as a talmid chacham".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesachim.54b.4?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=bi Pesachim 54b]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Theodore Tilton c1870.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''Theodore Tilton''' (October 2, 1835 &amp;ndash; May 29, 1907) was an [[United States|American]] [[newspaper]] [[editing|editor]], [[poet]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]. He was born in New York City to Silas Tilton and Eusebia Tilton (same surname). On his twentieth birthday, October 2, 1855, he married Elizabeth Richards, known as Libby Tilton. Tilton's newspaper work was fully supportive of abolitionism and the Northern cause in the American Civil War.

Theodore Tilton was present at The National Loyalist Convention held in Philadelphia in 1866. Frederick Douglas writes of him in his autobiography:

“There was one man present who was brave enough to meet the duty of the hour; one who was neither afraid nor ashamed to own me as a man and a brother; one man of the purest Caucasian type, a poet and a scholar, brilliant as a writer, eloquent as a speaker, and holding a high influential position-the editor of a weekly journal having the largest circulation of any weekly paper in the city or State of New York- and the man was MR. Theodore Tilton. He came to me by the hand in a most brotherly way, and proposed to walk with me in the procession.”

From 1860 to 1871, Tilton was the assistant of [[Henry Ward Beecher]]; however, in 1874 he filed a complaint against Beecher for "[[criminal conversation]]" (adultery) with Tilton's wife and sued for a $100,000 judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2owAQAAMAAJ|title=Theodore Tilton Vs.

Volume 2.|last=|first=|date=1875|publisher=McDivitt, Campbell &amp; Company|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, he was the 1869 commencement speaker for the [[The Irving Literary Society (Cornell University)|Irving Literary Society]].

Following the acquittal of Beecher in the trial, Tilton moved to Paris, where he lived for the rest of his life. In the 1880s, Tilton frequently played chess with fellow American exile (but ex-Confederate) [[Judah Benjamin]], until the latter died in 1884.

'''Venkateswara Temple''' is a [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite temple]] situated in the town of [[Dwaraka Tirumala]] of [[West Godavari district]] of the [[Indian state]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. The temple is dedicated to Lord [[Venkateswara]], an incarnation of [[Vishnu]]. The temple is also known by other name like Chinna [[Tirupati]] meaning Small Tirupati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwarakatirumala.org/temple.html|title=Tirumala Temple |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temple legend and History&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwarakatirumala.org/temple.html|title=Sri Venkateswara Swami Vari Devasthanam|website=www.dwarakatirumala.org|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
This pilgrimage centre is called  "Dwaraka Tirumala" after the great saint, "Dwaraka" who located the self manifested idol of Lord "Sri Venkateswara" after severe penance in a ‘Valmikam’ (ant hill). The devotees call Sri Venkateswara as Kaliyuga Vaikunta Vasa. This place is also called “Chinna Tirupati”.

As per Sastras North Indian rivers like Ganges and Yamuna are considered to be more and more holy as they go up to the origin and south Indian rivers like Krishna and Godavary are more and more holy as they go down the river to its mouth to the Sea. It is why there are numerous shrines and holy bathing ghats, at close intervals, on both sides of the great grand rivers Krishna and Godavary in their lower regions.

The region covered by our Dwaraka Tirumala is commanding the top most conspicuous position in India, being garlanded by these two great Indian rivers Krishna and Godavary, as pointed out by Brahma Purana.

The devotees who wish to go and offer their donations, or tonsures or any other offerings to Lord Venkateswara, Lord of Tirumala Tirupati, called as “Pedda Tirupati”, due to some reason, if they are unable to go there, they can offer their donations, prayers and worship in Dwaraka Tirumala temple.

Dwaraka Tirumala is a famous temple from the ancient times. According to some Puranas, the temple is popular even in Kruta yuga and is still attracting the devotees. According to Brahma Purana, Aja Maharaja, the Grand father of Lord Sri Rama also worshiped Lord Venkateswara for his marriage. On his way to the ‘Swayamvaram’ of Indumati, he passed by the temple. He did not offer prayers in the temple. The bride Indumati garlanded him, but he had to face a battle with the kings who came to the Swayamvaram. He realized that the battle was thrust on him for ignoring the temple on the way. After realizing this, Aja Maharaja prayed to the Lord Venkateswara. Suddenly the kings stopped the battle.

It is a great wonder to see two main idols under one Vimana Sikharam. One idol is a full and complete statue. The other is a half statue of the upper portion of the form of the Lord. The upper portion of the form is a self-manifested idol located by Sage "Dwaraka". The saints of the yore felt the prayers to the Lord are not complete without worshipping His holy feet. So, the saints joined together and installed a full statue behind the self-manifested idol, to worship the feet of the Lord according to Vaikhanasa Agamam.

It is believed that the prayers to the smaller statue of the Lord will lead to Moksha, and the big form stands for Dharma, Artha and Kama. The Tiru kalyanotsavam is celebrated twice a year. One for the self manifested idol in the month of  “Vaisakha” and the other for the installed idol in the month of  “Aswayuja”.

'''Magnificence of the Sanctum Sanctorum:'''

On entering the sanctum sanctorum, one feels a most inspiring and enchanting experience. The presiding mythological deity Lord Venkateswara is visible up to the Bust size and the lower portion is imagined to be in the earth. The holy feet are said to be offered to Bali Chakravarthi in “Patala” for his daily worship. The full size idol of Lord Sri Venkateswara standing at the back of the main idol is said to have been installed by the great social reformer Srimad [[Ramanuja]] of the 11th century. The idols of Padmavathi and Nanchari are installed in the Arthamandapa facing east. This is a full equipped shrine to be a Divyasthala.

'''Combination of Shiva and Vishnu on Adisesha:'''

The most peculiar aspect here is that the hill appearing to be a serpent in form, even to the naked eye, confirms the mythological version that Anantha, the serpent king has taken up this terrestrial form of serpent hill and is carrying God Mallikarjuna on the hood and Lord Venkateswara on the tail, thus creating a happy and harmonious compromise of Vaishnavism and Saivism at a single place.

'''Renovation and origin of the present structure:'''

The magnificent monuments like, Vimana, Mantapa, Gopura, Prakara etc., stand to the credit of Dharma Appa Raoa recent ruler (1762 – 1827) and the golden ornaments and silver vahanas stand to the credit of the generous queen Rani Chinnamma Rao of Mylavaram, Krishna Dist. (1877 – 1902). These things immortalize the glory of the shrine.

The main temple is a masterpiece of South Indian Architecture with its five-storied main Rajagopuram facing the south and three other gopurams on the other three sides. The Vimana is in the Nagara style and old Mukhamantapa is extended to a great extent to suit the present day needs. There are several temples of Alwars attached to the Prakara on all sides. The whole spacious compound has been paved with stone and flower trees are grown in an order as if to feast the eye of the pilgrims. There are other shrines in the temple such as  Anjaneya Swamy, Mount Garuda, image of saint Dwaraka and image of Sri Tallakapaka Annamacharya.

'''Prasadam'''

The famous "''[[Tirupati Laddu|Laddu]]''" is given at Dwaraka Tirumala Temple as [[prasadam]]. In this temple Daddojanam, Kattupongali, Sarkarapongali, Pulihora,Kadhambam,Gaarimukkalu,Appalu are being distributed daily to the devotees after Nivedana to the deity.

'''Hair tonsuring'''

Many devotees have their head tonsured as "Mokku", an offering to God. When Lord Balaji was hit on his head by a shepherd, a small portion of his scalp became bald. This was noticed by Neela Devi, a [[Gandharva]] princess. She felt "such an attractive face should not have a flaw". Immediately, she cut a portion of her hair and, with her magical power, implanted it on his scalp. Lord Balaji noticed her sacrifice. As hair is a beautiful asset of the female form, he promised her that all his devotees who come to his abode would offer their hair to him, and she would be the recipient of all the hair received. Hence, it is believed that hair offered by the devotees is accepted by Neela Devi. The place where pilgrims fulfill their vow of tonsure is called Kalyana Katta, which is to the west of the Main temple. Over 95 barbers, operating in two batches, are available at KalyanaKatta, to perform tonsure.
