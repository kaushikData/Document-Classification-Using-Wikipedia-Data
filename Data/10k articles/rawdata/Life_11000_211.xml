'''Algirdas''' ({{lang-be|Альгерд}}, {{lang-uk|Ольгерд}}, {{lang-pl|[[Olgierd (name)|Olgierd]]}}; {{circa|1296}}&amp;nbsp;– May 1377) was a ruler of medieval [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. He ruled the [[Lithuanians]] and [[Ruthenians]] from 1345 to 1377. With the help of his brother [[Kęstutis]] (who defended the western border of the Duchy) he created an empire stretching from the present [[Baltic states]] to the [[Black Sea]] and to within fifty miles of Moscow.

==Background==
Algirdas was one of the seven sons of Grand Prince [[Gediminas]]. Before his death in 1341, Gediminas divided his domain, leaving his youngest son [[Jaunutis]] in possession of the capital, [[Vilnius]]. With the aid of his brother, [[Kęstutis]], Algirdas drove out the incompetent Jaunutis and declared himself Grand Prince in 1345. He devoted the next thirty-two years to the development and expansion of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Olgierd|volume=20|page=80|first=Robert Nisbet|last=Bain|authorlink=Robert Nisbet Bain|short=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two factors are thought to have contributed to this result: the political sagacity of Algirdas and the devotion of Kęstutis. The division of their dominions is illustrated by the fact that Algirdas appears almost exclusively in [[Eastern Slavs|East Slavic]] sources, while Western chronicles primarily describe Kęstutis. Lithuania was surrounded by enemies.  The [[Teutonic Order]] in the northwest and the [[Golden Horde]] in the southwest sought Lithuanian territory, while [[Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] to the west and [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]] to the east were generally hostile competitors.

==Expansion of Lithuania==
[[File:Algirdas kunigaikštis.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Drawing of man in ceremonial dress, looking at a scepter|Algirdas by [[Alexander Guagnini]]]]
Algirdas held his own, also acquiring influence and territory at the expense of Muscovy and the Golden Horde and extending the borders of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the Black Sea. His principal efforts were directed toward securing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] lands which were part of the former [[Kievan Rus']]. Although Algirdas engineered the election of his son [[Andrei of Polotsk|Andrew]] as Prince of [[Pskov]] and a powerful minority of [[Novgorod Republic]] citizens supported him against Muscovy, his rule in both commercial centres was (at best) precarious.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Algirdas occupied the important principalities of [[Smolensk]] and [[Bryansk]] in western Russia. Although his relationship with the grand dukes of Muscovy was generally friendly (demonstrated by his marriages to two [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Russian princesses), he [[siege|besieged]] Moscow in 1368 and 1370 during the [[Lithuanian–Muscovite War (1368–1372)]]. An important feat by Algirdas was his victory over the Tatars in the [[Battle of Blue Waters]] at the [[Southern Bug]] in 1362, which resulted in the breakup of the [[Kipchaks]] and compelled the khan to establish his headquarters in the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

According to modern historians, "For Gediminas and Algirdas, retention of paganism provided a useful diplomatic tool and weapon&amp;nbsp;... that allowed them to use promises of [[Christianization of Lithuania|conversion]] as a means of preserving their power and independence".&lt;ref&gt;Muldoon, James. ''Varieties of Religious Conversion in the Middle Ages''. University Press of Florida, 1997. Page 140.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann von Wartberge]] and [[Jan Długosz]] described Algirdas as a pagan until his death in 1377. Contemporary Byzantine accounts support the Western sources; Patriarch Neilos described Algirdas as "fire-worshipping prince"&lt;ref&gt;F. Miklosich,  J. Mūller. Acta Patriarchatus Constantinopolitan. Vienna, 1862, Vol. 2, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; and another patriarch, Philotheos, excommunicated all Ruthenian noblemen who helped the "impious" Algirdas.&lt;ref&gt;F. Miklosich,  J. Mūller. Acta Patriarchatus Constantinopolitan. Vienna, 1862, Vol. 1, pp. 523–524&lt;/ref&gt; His pagan beliefs were also mentioned in 14th-century Byzantine historian [[Nicephorus Gregoras]]' accounts.&lt;ref&gt;I. Bekker. ''Nicephori Gregorae Historiae Byzantinae''. Bonn, 1829, Vol. 3 pp. 517–520&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1000 Algirdas.jpg|thumb|alt=Stone carving of two seated men|Algirdas (''left'') on the [[Millennium of Russia]] monument in [[Veliky Novgorod]]]]
After his death, Algirdas was burned on a ceremonial [[pyre]] with 18 horses and many of his possessions in a forest near [[Maišiagala]],&lt;ref&gt;"He was cremated with the best horses, clothes, resplendent in gold and girdled with a gilded silver belt and was covered with a gown woven of beads and gems", [[Marija Gimbutas]] [http://www.vaidilute.com/books/gimbutas/gimbutas-08.html has observed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609214104/http://www.vaidilute.com/books/gimbutas/gimbutas-08.html |date=9 June 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; probably in the Kukaveitis forest shrine located at {{coord|54|55|42|N|25|01|04|E|}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{lt icon}}[http://www.culture.lt/satenai/?leid_id=891&amp;kas=straipsnis&amp;st_id=15940 [[Vykintas Vaitkevičius]], Kukaveičio šventvietės mįslės in Šiaurės Atėnai 2 May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; His alleged burial site has undergone archaeological research since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrt.lt/news.php?strid=5082&amp;id=5208140 Lokalizavo kunigaikščio Algirdo palaikų kremavimo vietą] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906091901/http://www.lrt.lt/news.php?strid=5082 |date=6 September 2008 }}. retrieved on 22 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Algirdas' descendants include the [[Trubetzkoy]], [[House of Czartoryski|Czartoryski]] and [[House of Sanguszko|Sanguszko]] families.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Although Algirdas was said to have ordered the death of [[Anthony, John, and Eustathius of Vilnius]],{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} who were later [[canonization|glorified]] as martyrs of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the 16th-century [[Bychowiec Chronicle]] and 17th-century [[:uk:Густинський літопис|Hustynska Chronicle]] maintain that he converted to Orthodox Christianity some time before his marriage to Maria of Vitebsk in 1318. Several Orthodox churches were built in Vilnius during his reign, but later assertions about his baptism are uncorroborated by contemporary sources. Despite contemporary accounts and modern studies,&lt;ref&gt;Contributed by Antoni Prochaska, Jan Ochmanski, Gotthold Rhode, Marija Gimbutas, Edvardas Gudavičius etc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Mazeika'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Was Grand Prince Algirdas a Greek Orthodox Christian? |journal=[[Lituanus]]|year=1987|first=Rasa |last=Mažeika|volume=33|issue=4 |url=http://www.lituanus.org/1987/87_4_05.htm |accessdate=6 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, some Russian historians (such as Batiushikov) claim that Algirdas was an Orthodox ruler. The [[Kiev Monastery of the Caves]]' commemorative book, underwritten by Algirdas' descendants, recorded his [[baptismal name]] as Demetrius during the 1460s. Following [[Wojciech Wijuk Kojałowicz]] and [[Macarius Bulgakov|Macarius I]], [[Volodymyr Antonovych]] writes that Algirdas took monastic vows several days before his death and was interred at the [[Cathedral of the Theotokos, Vilnius|Cathedral of the Theotokos]] in Vilnius under the monastic name Alexius.

Algirdas balanced himself between Muscovy and Poland, spoke [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] (among other languages) and followed the majority of his [[paganism|pagan]] and Orthodox subjects rather than to alienate them by promoting [[Roman Catholicism]]. His son [[Jogaila]] ascended the Polish throne, converted to Roman Catholicism and founded [[Jagiellons|the dynasty]] which ruled Lithuania and Poland for nearly 200 years.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Algirdas ({{lang-be|Альгерд}}, ''Alhierd'') is also widely honoured in [[Belarus]] as a unifier of all Belarusian lands within one state, a successful military commander and ruler of medieval Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svaboda.org/a/25437985.html Князь Альгерд нарэшце вярнуўся ў Віцебск &amp;#91;Duke Alhierd Finally Returns to Viciebsk&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racyja.com/kultura/u-mensku-adkrylasya-vystava-knyaz-al/ У Менску адкрылася выстава “Князь Альгерд у выяўленчым мастацтве” &amp;#91;Exhibition "Duke Alhierd in Visual Arts" Opened in Minsk&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; A monument to him has been erected in [[Vitsebsk]] in 2014, as part of the celebration of the city's 1040th anniversary. Algirdas was [[Principality of Vitebsk|Duke of Vitebsk]] for over 20 years before becoming Grand Duke of Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.vitebsk.cc/2014/06/24/u-vitsebsku-wstalyavali-pomnik-knyazyu-algerdu-fotarepartazh/ У Віцебску ўсталявалі помнік князю Альгерду.

'''[[Apicomplexa]]ns''', a group of [[intracellular parasite]]s, have [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] stages evolved to allow them to survive the wide variety of environments they are exposed to during their complex life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jadwiga Grabda |title=Marine fish parasitology: an outline |page=8 |year=1991 |publisher=VCH |isbn=0-89573-823-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each stage in the life cycle of an [[apicomplexa]]n organism is typified by a ''cellular variety'' with a distinct [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[biochemistry]].

Not all apicomplexa develop all the following cellular varieties and division methods. This presentation is intended as an outline of a hypothetical generalised apicomplexan organism.

==Methods of asexual replication== 
{{See also|Fission (biology)}}
Apicomplexans (sporozoans) replicate via ways of [[multiple fission]] (also known as [[schizogony]]). These ways include '''{{vanchor|gametogony}}''', '''{{vanchor|sporogony}}''' and '''{{vanchor|merogony}}''', although the latter is sometimes referred to as schizogony, despite its general meaning.&lt;ref name="tanada"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yoshinori Tanada|author2=Harry K. Kaya|title =Insect pathology|publisher =Gulf Professional Publishing|year =1993|isbn =978-0-12-683255-6|url =https://books.google.com/?id=99YwOQnsgGUC&amp;lpg=PA415&amp;dq=difference%20between%20merogony%20and%20schizogony&amp;pg=PA415#v=onepage&amp;q=difference%20between%20merogony%20and%20schizogony&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merogony is an [[asexual reproduction|asexually reproductive]] process of apicomplexa. After infecting a host cell, a trophozoite ([[#Glossary|see glossary below]]) increases in size while repeatedly replicating its [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and other [[organelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861702199/schizogony.html |title=Schizogony definition |publisher=MSN Encarta |accessdate=2009-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122102257/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861702199/schizogony.html |archivedate=2009-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this process, the organism is known as a '''{{vanchor|meront}}''' or '''{{vanchor|schizont}}'''. [[Cytokinesis]] next subdivides the [[multinucleated]] schizont into numerous identical daughter cells called merozoites ([[#Glossary|see glossary below]]), which are released into the blood when the host cell ruptures. Organisms whose life cycles rely on this process include ''[[Theileria]]'', ''[[Babesia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-124-7-199604010-00004 |author=Herwaldt |last2=Persing |date=1 April 1996 |first2=DH |last3=Précigout |first3=EA |last4=Goff |first4=WL |last5=Mathiesen |first5=DA |last6=Taylor |first6=PW |last7=Eberhard |first7=ML |last8=Gorenflot |first8=AF  |title=A Fatal Case of Babesiosis in Missouri: Identification of Another Piroplasm That Infects Humans |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=124 |issue=7 |pages=643–650  |pmid=8607592 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Plasmodium]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-3156.1998.00223.x |last=Zhou |first=M. |date=6 January 2002 |last2=Liu |first2=Q. |last3=Wongsrichanalai |first3=C. |last4=Suwonkerd |first4=W. |last5=Panart |first5=K. |last6=Prajakwong |first6=S. |last7=Pensiri |first7=A. |last8=Kimura |first8=M. |last9=Matsuoka |first9=H. |displayauthors=8|title=High prevalence of Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale in malaria patients along the Thai-Myanmar border, as revealed by acridine orange staining and PCR-based diagnoses |journal=Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=304–312 |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3156.1998.00223.x |accessdate=2009-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]].''

Sporogony is a type of sexual and asexual reproduction. It involves [[karyogamy]], the formation of a [[zygote]], which is followed by [[meiosis]] and [[multiple fission]]. This results in the production of sporozoites.

Other forms of replication include '''{{vanchor|endodyogeny}}''' and '''{{vanchor|endopolygeny}}'''.
Endodyogeny is a process of [[asexual reproduction]], favoured by parasites such as ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''. It involves an unusual process in which two daughter cells are produced inside a mother cell, which is then consumed by the offspring prior to their separation.&lt;ref name=smyth&gt;{{cite book |author=James Desmond Smyth |author2=Derek Wakelin |title=Introduction to animal parasitology |year=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=101–102 |edition=3rd |isbn=0-521-42811-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endopolygeny is the division into several organisms at once by internal [[budding]].&lt;ref name=smyth /&gt;

===Infectious stages===
{{Anchor|Glossary}}A '''{{vanchor|sporozoite}}''' (G. ''sporos'', seed + ''zōon'', animal) is the cell form that infects new hosts. In ''[[Plasmodium]]'', for instance, the sporozoites are cells that develop in the mosquito's salivary glands, leave the mosquito during a blood meal, and enter [[liver]] cells ([[hepatocyte]]s), where they multiply. Cells infected with sporozoites eventually burst, releasing merozoites into the bloodstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esnips.com/doc/04326a97-13ce-4ec9-b4e5-32c9d7f316d8/Malaria%20-%20Life%20Cycle%20Of%20Plasmodium |title=Malaria - Life Cycle Of Plasmodium.swf |publisher=esnips |accessdate=2009-12-11 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091121224326/http://www.esnips.com/doc/04326a97-13ce-4ec9-b4e5-32c9d7f316d8/Malaria%20-%20Life%20Cycle%20Of%20Plasmodium| archivedate= 21 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sporozoites are motile and they move by [[gliding motility|gliding]].

A '''{{vanchor|merozoite}}''' (G. ''meros'', part [of a series] +''zōon'', animal) is the result of merogony that takes place within a host cell. During this stage, the parasite infects the host's cells and then  replicates its own nucleus and induces cell segmentation in a form of asexual reproduction. (In [[coccidiosis]], merozoites form the first phase of the internal life cycle of coccidian. In the case of ''[[Plasmodium]]'', merozoites infect [[red blood cell]]s and then rapidly reproduce asexually. The red blood cell host is destroyed by this process, which releases many new merozoites that go on to find new blood-borne hosts. Merozoites are non-motile. Before [[schizogony]], the merozoite is also known as the '''schizozoite'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Schizozoite |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/schizozoite |work =Farlex Partner Medical Dictionary |quote=A merozoite before schizogony, as in the exoerythrocytic phase of the development of the ''Plasmodium'' agent after sporozoite invasion of the hepatocyte and before multiple division. | year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''{{vanchor|[[gametocyte]]}}''' ([[Greek language|G.]] ''gametēs'', partner + ''kytos'', cell) is a name given to a parasite's [[gamete]]-forming cells. A male gametocyte divides to give many flagellated [[microgamete]]s, whereas the female gametocyte differentiates to a [[macrogamete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sinden | first1 = R.

An '''{{vanchor|ookinete}}''' (G. ''ōon'', egg + ''kinētos'', motile) is a fertilised [[zygote]] capable of moving spontaneously. It penetrates epithelial cells lining the midgut of [[mosquito]]es to form a thick-walled structure known as an oocyst under the mosquito's outer gut lining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ookinete |title=Ookinete (Medical Dictionary) |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=2009-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ookinetes are motile and they move by [[gliding motility|gliding]].

A '''{{vanchor|trophozoite}}''' (G. ''trophē'', nourishment + ''zōon'', animal) is the activated, intracellular feeding stage in the apicomplexan life cycle. After gorging itself on its host, the trophozoite undergoes schizogony and develops into a schizont, later releasing merozoites.

A '''hypnozoite''' (G. ''hypnos'', sleep + ''zōon'', animal) is a quiescent parasite stage that is best known for its "... probable association with latency and relapse in human malarial infections caused by ''Plasmodium ovale'' and ''P. vivax''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=M. B.|title=Malaria: origin of the term “hypnozoite”|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|date=2011|volume=44|pages=781–786|doi=10.1007/s10739-010-9239-3|pmid=20665090}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypnozoites are directly sporozoite-derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=M.

A '''{{vanchor|bradyzoite}}''' (G. ''bradys'', slow + ''zōon'', animal) is a sessile, slow-growing form of [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] [[microorganism]]s such as ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', among others responsible for parasitic infections. In chronic (latent) [[toxoplasmosis]], bradyzoites microscopically present as clusters enclosed by an irregular crescent-shaped wall (a [[pseudocyst]]) in infected muscle and brain tissues. Also known as a '''bradyzoic merozoite'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=M. B.|title=Terms for coccidian merozoites|journal=Annals of Tropical Medicine &amp; Parasitology|date=1987|volume=81|pages=463|doi=10.1080/00034983.1987.11812147|pmid=3446034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''{{vanchor|tachyzoite}}''' (G. ''tachys'', fast + ''zōon'', animal), contrasting with a bradyzoite, is a form typified by rapid growth and replication. Tachyzoites are the motile forms of those [[coccidia]]ns which form tissue [[cyst]]s, such as ''[[Toxoplasma]]'' and ''[[Sarcocystis]]''. Typically infecting cellular [[vacuole]]s, tachyzoites divide by endodyogeny and endopolygeny. Also known as a '''tachyzoic merozoite''' (same journal reference as for "bradyzoic merozoite", above).

An '''{{vanchor|oocyst}}''' (G. ''ōon'', egg + ''kystis'', bladder) is a hardy, thick-walled spore, able to survive for lengthy periods outside a host. The [[zygote]] develops within the spore, which acts to protect it during transfer to new hosts. Organisms that create oocysts include ''[[Eimeria]]'', ''[[Isospora]]'', ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'', and ''[[Toxoplasma]]''.

Vanderbilt was born on July 7, 1888, in [[Newark, New Jersey]], to Louis and Ellen H. ({{nee}} Leach) Vanderbilt. He had one sibling, a younger brother named Leslie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerhart|first=Eugene C.|title=Arthur T. Vanderbilt, the Compleat Counsellor|location=Albany, N.Y.|publisher=Q Corporation|date=1980|isbn=9780960410804|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Newark (now [[Barringer High School|Barringer]]) High School where he was class president, editor of the newspaper, and a member of two fraternal groups, The Ramblers (later Omega Gamma Delta) and Lambda Tau. Following high school he took off a year to work on the railroad to earn money for college.

He attended [[Wesleyan University]], where he was a member of [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]], president of the student body, and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. A sidelight of his Wesleyan career was the inauguration of President [[William A. Shanklin]]. Vanderbilt was one of the inauguration speakers, along with [[U. S. President]] [[William Howard Taft]], and then startled Taft by showing up later as a waiter at the inaugural dinner. Vanderbilt then attended [[Columbia University School of Law]].

==Career==
Many of Vanderbilt's ideas for court reform had been incorporated into the new judicial article of the New Jersey Constitution. One of those innovations was the designation of the Chief Justice as the administrative head of all courts in the state, replacing the previous system of almost completely autonomous courts.  As Chief Justice, he created the first state Administrative Office of the Courts in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Vanderbilt, 68, Dead. Jersey Chief Justice. Arthur Vanderbilt, Chief Justice Of New Jersey, Is Dead at 68 Held Annual Conferences Counsel to Norman Thomas Headed American Bar Group. |quote=[[Summit, New Jersey]], June 16, 1957. Chief Justice Arthur T. Vanderbilt of the New Jersey Supreme Court died at 1:20 this morning in Overlook Hospital here. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 16, 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An appreciation of the changes brought to the New Jersey judicial system can be gained from a comparison between the structure of the courts before the new constitution and after.  There were over 20 different courts in the system (e.g.-superior court, supreme court, court of errors and appeals, chancery, oyer &amp; terminer, orphan's court, county court, general sessions, quarter sessions, etc., etc., etc.)  which were replaced by the New Jersey Supreme Court, the Superior Court (Law, Chancery and Appellate Divisions), County Court, County District Court and the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court.  The County Courts were merged into the Superior Court, Law Division, as were the County District Courts, now known as the Special Civil Part of the Superior Court, and the Juvenile and Domestic Relations  Court, now the Family Part of the Chancery Division.  These were joined by the Tax Court.  In addition, there are Municipal Courts which handled minor criminal and ordinance violations.

In the new practice, if an action is filed in the wrong court there is a procedure to transfer the matter to the proper court.  Previously, filing the action in the wrong court was a fatal defect if the matter was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Professor John Lynch, who taught Constitutional Law and New Jersey Practice at The Seton Hall School of Law in the 1970s and 80s, told the apocryphal story of a politically sensitive case in the 1930s or 40s, in which the plaintiffs feared that the court would find it had no jurisdiction in order to avoid the political consequences of ruling in the plaintiff's favor.  To avoid this, the plaintiff filed the action separately in all 20+ courts, only to have each court rule that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter.  Professor Lynch, of whom this writer was a student, claimed to be constantly in search of the actual case;  it is not known if he was ultimately successful.

Vanderbilt was President of the [[American Bar Association]] in 1937–38.  He also served for many years as Dean of [[New York University Law School]], currently housed in a building that bears his name.  Vanderbilt was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1936, 1940 and 1944.  On two separate occasions he declined to be considered for nominations to the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3086/is_n3_11/ai_n28650227/pg_5/?tag=content;col1 Page 5]&lt;/ref&gt; Vanderbilt was the principal mentor to [[William J. Brennan, Jr]] when Brennan was a member of the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] and played an instrumental role in [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s nomination of Brennan to the [[United States Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3086/is_n3_11/ai_n28650227/pg_5/?tag=content;col1 Pages 5-7]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astroecology'''  concerns the interactions of [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] with [[space]] environments. It studies resources for [[life]] on [[planet]]s, [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s, around various [[star]]s, in [[Galaxy|galaxies]], and in the [[universe]].  The results allow estimating the future prospects for life, from [[planet]]ary to [[galaxy|galactic]] and [[cosmology|cosmological]] scales.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002"&gt;{{Citation |last=Mautner |first=Michael N. |title = Planetary Bioresources and Astroecology. 1.

==Overview==
The term "astroecology" was first applied in the context of performing studies in actual [[meteorite]]s to evaluate their potential resources favorable to sustaining life.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002" /&gt; Early results showed that meteorite/asteroid materials can support [[microorganisms]], [[algae]] and [[plant]] cultures under Earth's atmosphere and supplemented with water.

Several observations suggest that diverse planetary materials, similar to meteorites collected on Earth, could be used as agricultural soils, as they provide nutrients to support microscopic life when supplemented with water and an atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002"/&gt; Experimental astroecology has been proposed to rate planetary materials as targets for astrobiology exploration and as potential biological in-situ resources.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002"/&gt; The biological fertilities of planetary materials can be assessed by measuring water-extractable [[electrolyte]] nutrients. The results suggest that [[carbonaceous asteroid]]s and Martian [[basalt]]s can serve as potential future resources for substantial biological populations in the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002"/&gt;

Analysis of the essential [[nutrient]]s ([[carbon|C]], [[Nitrogen|N]], [[Phosphorus|P]], [[Potassium|K]]) in meteorites yielded information for calculating the amount of [[biomass]] that can be constructed from asteroid resources.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002" /&gt; For example, [[carbonaceous asteroid]]s are estimated to contain about 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; kg potential resource materials,&lt;ref name ="Lewis-1997"&gt;{{Citation |last=Lewis |first=J.S |author-link=J.

==Cultures on simulated asteroid/meteorite materials==
To quantify the potential amounts of life in biospheres, theoretical astroecology attempts to estimate the amount of biomass over the duration of a [[biosphere]]. The resources, and the potential time-integrated biomass were estimated for [[planetary system]]s, for [[habitable zone]]s around [[stars]], and for the [[galaxy]] and the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; Such astroecology calculations suggest that the limiting elements [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] in the estimated 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; kg carbonaceous asteroids could support 6·10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; kg biomass for the expected five billion future years of the [[Sun]], yielding a future time-integrated ''BIOTA'' (''BIOTA'', '''B'''iomass '''I'''ntegrated '''O'''ver '''T'''imes '''A'''vailable, measured in kilogram-years) of 3·10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years in the Solar System,&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; a hundred thousand times more than life on Earth to date. Considering biological requirements of 100 W kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; biomass, radiated energy about [[red giant]] stars and [[White dwarf|white]] and [[red dwarf]] stars could support a time-integrated ''BIOTA'' up to 10&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years in the galaxy and 10&lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years in the universe.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;

Such astroecology considerations quantify the immense potentials of future life in space, with commensurate [[biodiversity]] and possibly, [[intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; [[Chemical analysis]] of [[carbonaceous chondrite]] meteorites show that they contain extractable bioavailable [[water]], [[organic carbon]], and essential [[phosphate]], [[nitrate]] and [[potassium]] nutrients.&lt;ref name = 'nine'&gt;{{Citation | last = Jarosewich | first = E.| title = Chemical Analysis of the Murchison Meteorite | journal = Meteoritics | volume = 1 | pages = 49–52 | year = 1973 | bibcode = 1971Metic...6...49J | doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.1971.tb00406.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'ninea'&gt;{{Citation | last = Fuchs | first = L.H.| last2 = Olsen |first2 = E. |  last3 = Jensen | first3 = K.J. | title = Mineralogy, Mineral Chemistry and Composition of the Murchison (CM2) Meteorite | journal = Smithsonian Contributions to the Earth Sciences | volume = 10 | pages = 1–84 | year = 1973 | doi=10.5479/si.00810274.10.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'ten' &gt;{{Citation | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Planetary Resources and Astroecology.

Laboratory experiments showed that material from the [[Murchison meteorite]], when ground into a fine powder and combined with Earth's water and air, can provide the nutrients to support a variety of organisms including bacteria ([[Nocardia asteroides]]), algae, and plant cultures such as potato and asparagus.&lt;ref name = 'ten' /&gt; The microorganisms used organics in the carbonaceous meteorites as the carbon source. Algae and plant cultures grew well also on Mars meteorites because of their high bio-available phosphate contents.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002" /&gt; The Martian materials achieved soil fertility ratings comparable to productive agricultural soils.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002" /&gt; This offers some data relating to [[terraforming of Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Olsson-Francis | first1 = K  | last2 = Cockell | first2 = CS | title = Use of cyanobacteria in in-situ resource use in space applications | journal = Planetary and Space Science | volume = 58 | pages = 1279–1285 | year = 2010 | bibcode = 2010P&amp;SS...58.1279O | doi = 10.1016/j.pss.2010.05.005 | issue = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biomass that can be constructed from resources can be calculated by comparing the concentration of elements in the resource materials and in biomass (Equation 1).&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; A given mass of resource materials (''m&lt;sub&gt;resource&lt;/sub&gt;'')  can support ''m&lt;sub&gt;biomass, X&lt;/sub&gt;'' of biomass containing element ''X'' (considering ''X'' as the limiting nutrient), where ''c&lt;sub&gt;resource, X&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the concentration (mass per unit mass) of element ''X'' in the resource material and ''c&lt;sub&gt;biomass, X&lt;/sub&gt;'' is its concentration in the biomass.

&lt;math&gt;m_{biomass,\, X} = m_{resource,\, X} \frac{c_{resource,\, X}}{c_{biomass,\, X}}&lt;/math&gt;  (1)

Assuming that 100,000&amp;nbsp;kg biomass supports one human, the asteroids may then sustain about 6e15 (six million billion) people, equal to a million Earths (a million times the present population).{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Similar materials in the comets could support biomass and populations about one hundred times larger.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[Solar energy]] can sustain these populations for the predicted further five billion years of the Sun.

==Effects of wastage==
Astroecology also concerns wastage, such as the leakage of biological matter into space. This will cause an exponential decay of space-based biomass&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; as given by Equation (2), where M (biomass 0) is the mass of the original biomass, ''k'' is its rate of decay (the fraction lost in a unit time) and ''biomass t'' is the remaining biomass after time ''t''. 
			
:Equation 2:  &lt;math&gt;M_{biomass}(t) = M_{biomass} (0) e^{-kt}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Integration from time zero to infinity yields Equation (3) for the total time-integrated biomass (''BIOTA'') contributed by this biomass:

:Equation 3:  &lt;math&gt;BIOTA  = \frac{M_{biomass} (0)}{k}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if 0.01% of the biomass is lost per year, then the time-integrated ''BIOTA'' will be 10,000&lt;math&gt;M_{biomass} (0)&lt;/math&gt;. For the 6·10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; kg biomass constructed from asteroid resources, this yields 6·10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years of ''BIOTA'' in the Solar System. Even with this small rate of loss, life in the Solar System would disappear in a few hundred thousand years, and the potential total time-integrated ''BIOTA'' of 3·10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years under the main-sequence Sun would decrease by a factor of 5·10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, although a still substantial population of 1.2·10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; biomass-supported humans could exist through the habitable lifespan of the Sun.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; 
The integrated biomass can be maximized by minimizing its rate of dissipation. If this rate can be reduced sufficiently, all the constructed biomass can last for the duration of the habitat and it pays to construct the biomass as fast as possible. However, if the rate of dissipation is significant, the construction rate of the biomass and its steady-state amounts may be reduced allowing a steady-state biomass and population that  lasts throughout the lifetime of the habitat.

An issue that arises is whether we should build immense amounts of life that decays fast, or smaller, but still large, populations that last longer. Life-centered biotic ethics suggests that life should last as long as possible.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2009" /&gt;

==Galactic ecology==
If life reaches galactic proportions, [[technology]] should be able to access all of the materials resources, and sustainable life will be defined by the available energy.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt; The maximum amount of biomass about any star is then determined by the energy requirements of the biomass and by the [[luminosity]] of the star.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; For example, if 1&amp;nbsp;kg biomass needs 100 Watts, we can calculate the steady-state amounts of biomass that can be sustained by stars with various energy outputs. These amounts are multiplied by the life-time of the star to calculate the time-integrated ''BIOTA'' over the life-time of the star.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; Using similar projections, the potential amounts of future life can then be quantified.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;

For the Solar System from its origins to the present, the current  10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; kg biomass over the past four billion years gives a time-integrated biomass (''BIOTA'') of 4·10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years. In comparison, carbon, [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and water in the 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; kg asteroids allows 6·10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; kg biomass that can be sustained with energy for the 5 billion future years of the Sun, giving a ''BIOTA'' of 3·10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years in the Solar System and 3·10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years about  10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; stars in the galaxy. Materials in comets could give biomass and time-integrated ''BIOTA'' a hundred times larger. &lt;!--In space colonies? Certainly not on the outer planets as we know them. Lots of assumptions are loaded in this statement, when the research was limited to water-soluble chemicals: After the Sun turns into a red giant, life in the outer Solar System can contribute significant further biomass for a billion years.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt; --&gt;

The Sun will then become a [[white dwarf]] star, radiating 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Watts that sustains 1e13 kg biomass for an immense hundred million trillion (10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;) years, contributing a time-integrated ''BIOTA'' of 10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; years. The 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; white dwarfs that may exist in the galaxy during this time can then contribute a time-integrated ''BIOTA'' of 10&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years. Red dwarf stars with luminosities of 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; Watts and life-times of 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; years can contribute 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years each, and 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; red dwarfs can contribute 10&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years, while [[brown dwarf]]s can contribute 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years of time-integrated biomass (''BIOTA'') in the galaxy. In total, the energy output of stars during 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; years can sustain a time-integrated biomass of about 10&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years in the galaxy. This is one billion trillion (10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;) times more life than has existed on the Earth to date. In the universe, stars in 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; galaxies could then sustain 10&lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years of life.

&lt;!--This section is little more than a though experiment: contemplating the spontaneous conversion of all atoms (barionic matter) in the universe to living matter. No use in Wikipedia.
==Potential life in the universe==
It is of interest to estimate the maximum amount of potential life in this universe. This would be achieved if all the [[baryonic matter]] was converted to living matter. However, life requires energy, and a fraction of this mass would then need to be converted to energy to sustain life.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt;  Assume that the power requirement is &lt;math&gt;P_{biomass}&lt;/math&gt; (measured in J sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and the energy yield is ''E&lt;sub&gt;yield&lt;/sub&gt;'') (measured in J kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). If the biomass is converted to energy at the rate required to provide the needed power for the remaining biomass, then the rate of decrease of biomass is given by equation&lt;ref name="Weber-1985" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{d M_{biomass}}{d t} E_{yield, biomass} = P_{biomass} M_{biomass}&lt;/math&gt; (4)

This is similar to equation (3) with a rate of loss &lt;math&gt;k_{waste} =  P_{biomass}{E_{yield, biomass}}&lt;/math&gt;. The remaining biomass after time ''t'' is given according to Equation (5) as:

:&lt;math&gt;M_{biomass} (t) = M_{biomass} (0) e^{- \frac{P_{biomass}}{E_{yield, biomass}} t}&lt;/math&gt; (5)

With an energy requirement of 100 W kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; biomass and with the maximum energy yield of ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' a fraction of 3.5·10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; of the biomass per year would need to be converted to energy, yielding about 3·10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years of time-integrated BIOTA per kg biomass. An estimated 10&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt; kg baryonic matter in the galaxy and 10&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt; kg in the universe, all converted to biomass, would then yield 3·10&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years of time-integrated biomass in the galaxy and 3·10&lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years of time-integrated biomass in the universe.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt;

If all the biomass consisted of 100&amp;nbsp;kg humans, this would allow 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; humans in the galaxy living 3·10&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt; human-years and 10&lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt; human-years in the universe. This illustrates the immense potential amounts of biological and human life in the universe.

==Directed panspermia==

These projections are based on information about 15 billion past years since the [[Big Bang]], but the habitable future is much longer, spanning trillions of eons. Therefore, physics, astroeclogy resources, and some cosmological scenarios may allow organized life to last, albeit at an ever slowing rate, indefinitely.&lt;ref name = 'twenty'  &gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447 | last = Dyson | first = F. | title = Without End: Physics and Biology in an Open Universe | journal = Rev.

{{nihongo4|'''Beerus, the God of Destruction'''|破壊神ビルス|Hakaishin Birusu|lead=yes}} is a  character in the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' franchise created by [[Akira Toriyama]]. Beerus made his first appearance in the 2013 feature film ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods]]'' as the main antagonist and returned as a supporting character in ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F']]'', as well as one of the main characters in ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]''. He is a purple [[sphynx cat]]-like god seen wearing traditional [[Egyptian culture|Egyptian]] clothing and ornaments, whose occupation is to maintain balance by destroying planets, in contrast to the Kaiō-shin who create and preserve them.

It had been stated that Beerus is a star buster by Whis. Often seen destroying planets at a whim, Beerus' two sole desires are, being quite a gourmet, enjoying the Universe's finest cooking and fighting opponents whom he considers to be worthy. The latter ultimately leads him to look for the {{nihongo4|Super Saiyan God|超サイヤ人ゴッド|Sūpā Saiyajin Goddo}} who turns out to be one of the Saiyans now living on Earth. Eventually, Son Goku, with the help of other Saiyans, transforms into the Super Saiyan God and fights Beerus, just to be defeated by the God of Destruction. Having enjoyed the match, Beerus spares both Goku and the Earth, saying that Goku was the second strongest opponent he ever faced; first being his caretaker and martial arts teacher, Whis.

== Conception and creation ==
The development of Beerus' characters first started sometime in 2011. His name and voice actors, along with the film's poster, were officially revealed in December 2012 in ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'''s first issue of 2013; Beerus, the God of Destruction voiced by [[Kōichi Yamadera]].&lt;ref name="2013Jump"&gt;''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' issue #1, 2012-12-02&lt;/ref&gt; The film poster displays Super Saiyan Goku combating the God of Destruction Beerus, with Whis floating showered in light in the background.&lt;ref name="2013Jump"/&gt; The character was in the initial draft of the ''Battle of Gods'', though Toriyama notes Beerus was changed completely despite his liking of the concept.

The name "Beerus" was taken from the word "virus", though Toriyama mistook its origin as "beer", which began the naming pun used for Whis during production of ''Battle of Gods'', and later future Gods of Destruction and attendants.&lt;ref&gt;"The name Beerus, I used as-is from the story outline. Anyway, it’s apparently a name that was taken from 'virus', but I mistakenly thought it came from 'beer', and gave his attendant the name 'Whis', which I took from 'whiskey'." - Akira Toryama, Asahi Shimbun digital interview&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following week's issue, he revealed that Beerus' design is based on a cat and his clothes based on Egyptian garments.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', issue #15, 2013-03-11&lt;/ref&gt; Beerus' design was partially based on a [[Cornish Rex]] cat that had lived with Toriyama at the time of design work, the cat miraculously recovering from an illness and the veteran joking that it was demonic.&lt;ref name="cat designs"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON　BALL　超全集 1 STORY &amp; WORLD GUIDE|year=2013|publisher=Shueisha|pages=28–31 |isbn=978-4-08-782496-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chozenshu 1, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Toriyama initially had the character to resemble a [[lizard]], changing it entirely after. Beerus was planned to use either a spoon or fork in combatting the heroes, the idea being overturned when Tadayoshi Yamamuro, the animation director on ''Battle of Gods'', considered it difficult for Beerus to fight that way and made the suggestion of chopsticks instead.&lt;ref&gt;Tadayoshi Yamamuro interview, okstars.okwave.jp&lt;/ref&gt;

The April issue of ''V Jump'' teased about a new Super Saiyan transformation being in the film, titled {{nihongo4|"Super Saiyan God"|超サイヤ人ゴッド|Sūpā Saiya-jin Goddo}}, saying: 39 years ago, the Oracle Fish told Beerus that the Super Saiyan God would appear before him. And that this is the beginning of the movie's story.&lt;ref&gt;''[[V Jump]]'', issue #4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'' issue #14 of 2013, Toriyama said that the plot for ''Battle of Gods'' began two years ago with ideas for the God of Destruction and Super Saiyan God, and that he got deeply involved in the story in order to keep it in-line with the series' original tone so kids could enjoy it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', issue #14, 2013-03-04&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearances ==
Involved in events previously left unexplained, preceding the events depicted in the manga, Beerus is revealed to be the one who sealed Old Kaiō-shin into the Z Sword and destroyed North Kaiō's planet, with only the small planet where he now lives remaining, both acts being out of anger over squabbles. He also knew about Freeza's plan to destroy Planet Vegeta, and went into a deep sleep soon after.

Beerus awakens from a 39-year sleep and goes in search of a Super Saiyan God. He travels to meet Goku after learning that he had defeated Freeza, and easily defeated him despite his advanced stages of the Super Saiyan transformation. Beerus next travels to Earth, coming across partygoers of [[Bulma|Bulma's]] birthday party, including [[Vegeta]], who met Beerus during his youth and is fearful of him due to his superior strength. Although Beerus is disappointed that Vegeta does not know what a Super Saiyan God is, he stays at Bulma's party because he enjoys Earth's cuisine. Beerus is mostly calm until requesting some pudding from [[Majin Boo]], who refuses to share, causing him to become enraged and easily beat Boo, Gotenks, [[Gohan]], [[Android 18]], [[Piccolo]], and [[Tenshinhan]] in combat. Bulma slaps Beerus, who he slaps back and in doing so causes an angered Vegeta to grow in strength and seemingly surpass him. Beerus then easily defeats Vegeta after powering up, and moves to destroy the Earth until Goku pleads for him to allow the Earthlings time to find a way of making a Super Saiyan God appear. After the Saiyans perform a ritual, which sees Goku transform into a Super Saiyan God, Beerus duels him and though defeating him, spares him and the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods''&lt;/ref&gt; During Freeza's resurrection and subsequent battle with the heroes, Beerus observes the fight and worries Freeza that he will become involved until Beerus confirms he will not.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'&lt;/ref&gt;

After Goku defeats Freeza, Beerus sets up a tournament between his Universe 7, and his twin brother [[Champa (Dragon Ball)|Champa]]'s Universe 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Martial Arts Match Has Been Decided! The Team Captain Is Stronger Than Goku|date=January 31, 2016|series=''Dragon Ball Super''}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Universe 7 wins, Beerus wishes for the population of Universe 6's Earth to be restored. Beerus, Whis and Goku travel to Universe 10 to meet with Gowasu and [[Zamasu]] after gaining a clue about Goku Black's identity;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Uncover Black's Identity! To the Sacred World of the Kais!|date=July 31, 2016|series=''Dragon Ball Super''|number=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Zamasu is discovered to be planning to kill Gowasu, Beerus confronts him and erases him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Protect Supreme Kai Gowasu - Destroy Zamasu|date=September 25, 2016|series=''Dragon Ball Super''|number=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beerus then murders the already deceased [[Dr. Mashirito]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Goku vs Arale!

The Universe's Greatest Martial Arts Tournament!!|date=February 5, 2017|series=''Dragon Ball Super''|number=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Voice actors ==
[[File:Jason Douglas.jpg|thumb|Jason Douglas is the English voice of Beerus.]]
Beerus is voiced by [[Kōichi Yamadera]] in all Japanese ''Dragon Ball'' media.&lt;ref name="Super"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-15/dragon-ball-super-main-visual-reveals-2-new-characters/.89281|title=Dragon Ball Super Main Visual Reveals 2 New Characters|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2015-06-15|accessdate=2015-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English Funimation dub, Beerus is voiced by [[Jason Douglas]]. Douglas interpreted voice director [[Chris Sabat]] as believing Beerus' voice was "similar in tone" to Douglas' prior role in ''[[Borderlands 2]]'' as Krieg. Douglas found out he had earned the role through his agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2HaTrshDRM |title=Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods - Extended Interviews - Jason Douglas (Part One)|date=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bang Zoom! Entertainment]] dub he is voiced by [[John DeMita]].&lt;ref name="BZECast"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-01-17/toonami-asia-reveals-more-dub-cast-for-dragon-ball-super-anime/.111147|title=Toonami Asia Reveals More Dub Cast for Dragon Ball Super Anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2017-01-07|accessdate=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abilities ==
Beerus possesses strength capable of easily destroying the universe. During his first fight with Super Saiyan God Goku, the clashing of the two's fists created ripples which traveled through the macrocosm of Universe 7, and was stated to be able to destroy the universe if it continued. It was also revealed after the fight that Beerus was holding back a considerably huge amount of his power and had an ability to neutralize energy of any mortal's energy. In Chapter 28 of the Dragon Ball Super manga, Beerus was shown to have the imperfect version of Ultra Instinct, which was showcased as he effortlessly dodged the attacks of every other God of Destruction. Some of Beerus' unique attacks include {{nihongo|''Sphere of Destruction''|ビルス玉|Birusu Dama}}, where he creates a small sun-like ball of energy inbetween his hands, raises his arms, and quickly enlarges the ball before launching it, along with {{Nihongo|''Destruction before Creation''}}, where he surrounds himself in an aura resembling a [[sun]] prior to releasing an energy wave. Beerus' strongest technique, the ''Hakai'' (Destruction|{{nihongo|破壊|はかい}} can be used to completely destroy all objects and entities within the universe. The Hakai is able to instantly destroy the body and even souls of mortals and low-tier Gods, which can be seen in action when Beerus uses the technique on [[Zamasu]] and the ghost of [[Dr. Mashirito]]. Although the technique is first seen being used by Beerus, all Gods of Destruction can utilize the ability. Similarly to other Gods of Destructions and Kaiō-shins, Beerus is life linked to the East Kaiō-shin, where if one dies then so will the other. This amounts to a weakness given East Kaiō-shin's vast inferiority in strength to Beerus. Due to the East Kaiō-shin being killed in the alternate timeline, while assisting Trunks in facing [[Dabura]], the version of Beerus that exists there dies during his sleep.&lt;ref&gt;''Dragon Ball Super'' volume 3, chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearances in other media ==
Beerus has appeared in several ''Dragon Ball'' games, the first being ''[[Dragon Ball Heroes]]''. In the 2015 game ''[[Dragon Ball Xenoverse]]'', Beerus pretends to be possessed by Demigra before revealing gods are immune to his powers, Beerus then engaging him in battle with the player and after besting him fighting the player and Trunks with Whis in a test, Beerus allowing the player to defeat Demigra after he passes, staying awake long enough to see the player overcome Demigra in battle. Beerus also serves as a mentor, teaching his moves to the player. In the 2016 sequel ''[[Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2]]'', Beerus becomes angered by the bad taste of the pudding made by the Supreme Kai of Time, causing Whis and the player to have to subdue him. Beerus and Whis leave Earth while Freeza is attacking it when contacted by the Supreme Kai of Time, allowing Freeza to destroy Earth without Whis' prevention and the pair discovering they have been deceived by Towa. Beerus and the player fight Whis before Beerus and Whis depart from the main story.

Reception to Beerus is positive. In 2015, Beerus was ranked No. 8 on Jacob Yothment's list ''Top 10 Villains of the Dragon Ball Franchise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thelatestpull.com/2015/04/top-10-villains-of-the-dragon-ball-franchise/|title=Top 10 Villains of the Dragon Ball Franchise|date=April 9, 2015|publisher=thelatestpull.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reviewer Nathan Farrugla saw Beerus as being "an interesting villain", citing his nature being unpredictable and varying motives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.capsulecomputers.com.au/dragon-ball-z-battle-of-gods-uncut-edition-review/|title=Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods Uncut Edition Review|date=November 30, 2014|publisher=Capsule Computers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Douglas' voice work as Beerus in the English Funimation dub was also praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/65498/dragon-ball-z-battle-of-the-gods-extended-edition/|title=Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods (Blu-ray)|date=October 7, 2014|publisher=dvdtalk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5075">'''Captain Carl Peter Blom''', Swedish sailor and founder of [[Smådalarö Gård]], was born 1762 in Mjöfjärd southeast of [[Dalarö]]. At the age of six Blom's father died. His Uncle, [[Carl Gustav Berg]], raised him and taught him to be a sailor.&lt;ref name="krusenbergherrgard.se"&gt;http://www.krusenbergherrgard.se/smadalarogard/omsmadalarogard/historik.367.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Blom became captain of his own ship and travelled both in the Mediterranean Sea and to America. During some time he was an employee of the [[Swedish West India Company]] that ran trade between [[Stockholm]] and [[Gustavia, Saint Barthélemy|Gustavia]], capital of then Swedish colony [[Saint Barthélemy]]. Blom also participated in the [[Battle of Svensksund]] during the [[Russo-Swedish War (1788–90)|Russo-Swedish War]] (1788–1790).&lt;ref name="krusenbergherrgard.se"/&gt;
  
In October 1789 Captain Blom was an appointed an extraordinary assignment by king [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]]’s right hand, Michael Ankarswärd. He was supposed to hand over 54 Turks, that were saved from Russian captivity, back to Turkey again. Furthermore, he was supposed to deliver “gifts” to the [[Bey of Tunis]]. This, in order to avoid Swedish ships being attacked by pirates, who then ravaged the coast of North Africa without resistance. It was a dangerous task, Catain Blom however was a brave man and he accepted the assignment in exchange for a great deal of money. The following years as Captain on a non-governmental trade ship made Carl Peter Blom a very wealthy man.&lt;ref name="krusenbergherrgard.se"/&gt;

==Smådalarö Gård==
In 1802 Captain Blom bought a part of the [[Tyresö]] estate, located outside Stockholm, from Countess Brita Bonde.&lt;ref name="dalaro.info"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dalaro.info/Dalarohistoria.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519041232/http://www.dalaro.info/Dalarohistoria.pdf# |archive-date=2011-05-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The part that Blom bought for 12 000 [[Swedish riksdaler]] banco, consisted of; [[Smådalarö]], Västertorp, Gränö, [[Gåsö]] and [[Kymmendö]], all located in the [[Stockholm archipelago]].&lt;ref name="krusenbergherrgard.se"/&gt; [[Kymmendö]] was also later portrayed as Hemsö, in [[August Strindberg]] ’s “[[Natives of Hemsö]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stockholmtown.com/templates/page____7092.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501045922/http://www.stockholmtown.com/templates/page____7092.aspx |archivedate=2008-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1809 Blom built the mansion [[Smådalarö gård]] which celebrates 200-years anniversary in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalaro.se/pdf/Dalar%C3%B6tidningNr2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726160616/http://www.dalaro.se/pdf/Dalar%C3%B6tidningNr2.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Captain Blom was very attached to the island where he was borne, Mjöfjärd, and therefore built Smådalarö Gård on a strategic spot from where he could see his childhood home. First the stone house had two floors, but as he still could not see Mjöfjärd, he added a third floor.  By 1810 the house was finished. Captain Blom himself did not live in the stone house. In the house he instead held parties and dinners for his guests. Today, the house is the main building of the estate and hotel that Smådalarö Gård has become.&lt;ref name="dalaro.info"/&gt;

Blom lived in a smaller building nearby, that does not exist today. He preferred to live his life alone and when he died from heart seizure in 1818, he had no children of his own. Due to this, his nephew, Anders Berg, inherited the estate. Berg had been in love with a maid at the estate, Anna Sofia, for a long time. Captain Blom’s opinion was that Berg deserved a “better” wife, and therefore had Anna Sofia sent away with boat to another part of the archipelago. This had caused great disputes between Blom and his nephew, and as the story goes, this was what caused the seizure. Still, after Blom’s death, Berg took the opportunity of marrying Anna Sofia. They lived happily until Anders died in 1835. His widow managed the estate 25 further years.&lt;ref name="dalaro.info"/&gt;

==Other activities==
* Captain Blom also established the Dalarö dairy farm in 1810.&lt;ref name="dalaro.biz"&gt;http://www.dalaro.biz/Artiklar/Art%2014%20Verksamheter%20Dalaro%201950.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civil courage''' is a type of courage, related closely to heroism, in which a person acts [[bravery|bravely]] to intervene in a social situation.

==Overview==
Italian journalist and writer {{ill|Franca Magnani|de}} (1925-1996) wrote, "Je mehr Bürger mit Zivilcourage ein Land hat, desto weniger Helden wird es einmal brauchen" ("The more citizens with civil courage which a country has, the fewer heroes it needs").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologie.uzh.ch/de/bereiche/sob/motivation/zivilcourage/zivilcourage.html |title=Über Zivilcourage |language=German |website=[[University of Zurich]] |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil Courage today ==

Civil courage has been referred to by [[psychologist]] Tobias Greitemeyer as constituting acts of [[bravery]], carried out with the objective of enforcing a societal or ethical standard, without concern for the effect these acts might have on one’s own position. In this way it is distinguished from [[alturism|altruistic]] behavior and other forms of courage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greitemeyer|first1=Tobias|title=Civil courage: Implicit theories, related concepts, and measurement|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|volume=2|issue=2|pages=115–119|doi=10.1080/17439760701228789|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of altruistic, helping behavior, an individual might expect to be praised or receive positive social consequences from the result of their having helped, despite possible financial or material loss. In actions where civil courage is demonstrated, the person carrying out the action may experience negative social consequences such as alienation, verbal abuse or violence. Civil courage is displayed when a person, in spite of the perceived threat of negative consequences acts to intervene in a social context. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osswald|first1=Silvia|title=What Is Moral Courage?

'''Civil disobedience''' is the active, professed refusal of a [[citizenship|citizen]] to obey certain [[law]]s, demands, orders or commands of a [[government]] or occupying international power. Civil disobedience is sometimes defined as having to be [[nonviolent]] to be called civil disobedience. Civil disobedience is sometimes, therefore, equated with [[nonviolent resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Violent Civil Disobedience and Willingness to Accept Punishment|volume=8|issue=2|date=June 2007|publisher=Essays in Philosophy|url=http://commons.pacificu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1277&amp;context=eip}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The justifiability of violent civil disobedience|author=John Morreall|pages=35–47|year=1976|issue=1|volume=6|journal=Canadian Journal of Philosophy|jstor=40230600}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Although civil disobedience is considered to be an expression of contempt for law, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] regarded civil disobedience to be a display and practice of reverence for law; for as "Any man who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust and willingly accepts the penalty by staying in jail in order to arouse the conscience of the community on the injustice of the law is at that moment expressing the very highest respect for law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooks|first1=Ned|title=Meet The Press: Martin Luther King, Jr. on the Selma March|url=https://archives.nbclearn.com/portal/site/k-12/flatview?cuecard=48756|website=NBC Learn|publisher=NBCUniversal Media|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Overview==
Its earliest successful implementation was brought about during the lead up to the nonviolent [[Glorious Revolution]] in Britain, when the [[1689 Bill of Rights]] was documented, the last Catholic monarch was deposed, and male and female joint-co-monarchs were elevated.  The [[Midlands Enlightenment|English Midland Enlightenment]] had developed a manner of voicing objection to a law viewed as illegitimate and then taking the consequences of the law.  This was focused on the illegitimacy of laws claimed to be "divine" in origin, including the "divine rights of Kings" and the "divine rights of man", and the legitimacy of laws acknowledged to be made by human beings.

It later became an effective tool by various peoples who objected to British occupation, such as in [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|the 1919 Revolution]], however, this was never used with native laws that were more oppressive than the British occupation, leading to problems for these countries today.&lt;ref name="Egypt"&gt;{{Citation|title=Nonviolent Social Movements: A Geographical Perspective|author=Zunes, Stephen (1999:42)|publisher=Blackwell Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Saad Zaghloul|Zaghloul Pasha]], considered the mastermind behind this massive civil disobedience, was a native middle-class, [[Al-Azhar University|Azhar]] graduate, political activist, judge, parliamentary and ex-cabinet minister whose leadership brought Christian and Muslim communities together as well as women into the massive protests. Along with his companions of [[Wafd Party]], who started campaigning in 1914, they have achieved independence of Egypt and a first constitution in 1923.

Civil disobedience is one of the many ways people have rebelled against what they deem to be unfair laws. It has been used in many [[nonviolent resistance]] movements in [[British Raj|India]] ([[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s campaigns for [[Indian independence movement|independence]] from the [[British Empire]]), in [[Czechoslovakia]]'s [[Velvet Revolution]], in early stages of Bangladesh independence movement against Pakistani repression and in [[East Germany]] to oust their [[communist]] governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tikkun reader|author=Michael Lerner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Africa]] in the fight against [[apartheid]], in the [[American civil rights movement]], in the [[Singing Revolution]] to bring independence to the [[Baltic countries]] from the [[Soviet Union]], recently with the 2003 [[Rose Revolution]] in Georgia and the 2004 [[Orange Revolution]]&lt;ref name="The Orange Revolution"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/html/041206/story.html |title=The Orange Revolution |publisher=Time Magazine |date=12 December 2004 |accessdate=30 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410051430/http://www.time.com/time/europe/html/041206/story.html |archivedate=April 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Ukraine, among other various movements worldwide.

One of the oldest depictions of civil disobedience is in [[Sophocles]]' play ''[[Antigone (Sophocles play)|Antigone]]'', in which [[Antigone]], one of the daughters of former King of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]], [[Oedipus]], defies [[Creon]], the current King of Thebes, who is trying to stop her from giving her brother [[Polynices]] a proper burial.  She gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law.  She is not at all afraid of the death he threatens her with (and eventually carries out), but she is afraid of how her conscience will smite her if she does not do this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31/31-h/31-h.htm#antigone Sophocle's ''Antigone''], Project Gutenberg, F. Storr translation, 1912, Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Peterloo massacre]] of 1819, the poet [[Percy Shelley]] wrote the political poem ''[[The Mask of Anarchy]]'' later that year, that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time—and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of [[social action]]. According to [[Ashton Nichols]], it is perhaps the first [[modern history|modern]] statement of the principle of nonviolent protest.&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;[http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105232938/http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf|date=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version was taken up by the author [[Henry David Thoreau]] in his essay [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|''Civil Disobedience'']], and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of ''[[Satyagraha]]''.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt; Gandhi's Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Weber, ''Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley's ''Masque of Anarchy'' to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India.&lt;ref name=AFP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoreau's 1849 essay ''Civil Disobedience'', originally titled "Resistance to Civil Government", has had a wide influence on many later practitioners of civil disobedience. The driving idea behind the essay is that citizens are morally responsible for their support of aggressors, even when such support is required by law. In the essay, Thoreau explained his reasons for having [[tax resistance|refused to pay taxes]] as an act of [[protest]] against [[slavery]] and against the [[Mexican–American War]]. He writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man's shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too. See what gross inconsistency is tolerated. I have heard some of my townsmen say, "I should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves, or to march to Mexico;—see if I would go;" and yet these very men have each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by their money, furnished a substitute.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the 1850s, a range of minority groups in the [[United States]]: Blacks, Jews, Seventh Day Baptists, Catholics, anti-prohibitionists, racial egalitarians, and others—employed civil disobedience to combat a range of legal measures and public practices that to them promoted ethnic, religious, and [[racial discrimination]]. Pro Public and typically peaceful resistance to political power would remain an integral tactic in modern American [[minority rights]] politics.&lt;ref&gt;Volk, Kyle G. (2014). ''Moral Minorities and the Making of American Democracy''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Benjamin D. Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg|thumb|[[Henry David Thoreau]]'s classic essay ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'' inspired [[Martin Luther King]] and many other [[Activism|activists]].]]

[[Henry David Thoreau]]'s 1849 essay "Resistance to Civil Government" was eventually renamed "Essay on Civil Disobedience". After his landmark lectures were published in 1866, the term began to appear in numerous sermons and lectures relating to slavery and the war in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;The Gospel Applied to the Fugitive Slave Law [1850]: A Sermon, by [[mayur]] (1851)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Higher Law", in Its Application to the Fugitive Slave Bill:... by John Newell and [[John Chase Lord]] (1851)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Limits of Civil Disobedience: A Sermon..., by [[Nathaniel Hall]] (1851)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Duty and Limitations of Civil Disobedience: A Discourse, by [[Samuel Colcord Bartlett]] (1853)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, by the time Thoreau's lectures were first published under the title "Civil Disobedience", in 1866, four years after his death, the term had achieved fairly widespread usage.

It has been argued that the term "civil disobedience" has always suffered from ambiguity and in modern times, become utterly debased. Marshall Cohen notes, "It has been used to describe everything from bringing a test-case in the federal courts to [[taking aim at a federal official]]. Indeed, for [[Vice President of the United States|[US] Vice President]] [[Spiro Agnew|[Spiro] Agnew]] it has become a code-word describing the activities of muggers, arsonists, draft evaders, campaign hecklers, campus militants, anti-war demonstrators, juvenile delinquents and political assassins."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Civil Disobedience in a Constitutional Democracy|author=Marshall Cohen|publisher=The Massachusetts Review|volume=10|issue=2|date=Spring 1969|pages=211–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LeGrande writes that
{{quote|the formulation of a single all-encompassing definition of the term is extremely difficult, if not impossible. In reviewing the voluminous literature on the subject, the student of civil disobedience rapidly finds himself surrounded by a maze of [[semantic]]al problems and grammatical niceties. Like [[Alice in Wonderland]], he often finds that specific terminology has no more (or no less) meaning than the individual orator intends it to have.}}
He encourages a distinction between lawful protest demonstration, nonviolent civil disobedience, and violent civil disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Northwestern University|doi=10.2307/1141639|title=Nonviolent Civil Disobedience and Police Enforcement Policy|author=J. L. LeGrande|volume=58|issue=3|date=Sep 1967|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science|pages=393–404|jstor=1141639|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5472&amp;context=jclc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to P.&amp;nbsp;K. Rao, dated September 10, 1935, Gandhi disputes that his idea of civil disobedience was derived from the writings of Thoreau:&lt;ref&gt;Letter to P.K. Rao, Servants of India Society, September 10, 1935, Letter quoted in Louis Fischer's, ''The Life of Mahatma Gandhi,'' Part I, Chapter 11, pp. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The statement that I had derived my idea of Civil Disobedience from the writings of Thoreau is wrong. The resistance to authority in South Africa was well advanced before I got the essay&amp;nbsp;... When I saw the title of Thoreau's great essay, I began to use his phrase to explain our struggle to the English readers. But I found that even "Civil Disobedience" failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle. I therefore adopted the phrase "Civil Resistance."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Theories ==
In seeking an active form of civil disobedience, one may choose to deliberately break certain laws, such as by forming a peaceful blockade or occupying a facility illegally,&lt;ref name="Right to Protest"&gt;{{Citation|title=Your Right To Protest|author=ACLU of Oregon|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though sometimes violence has been known to occur.  Often there is an expectation to be attacked or even beaten by the authorities. Protesters often undergo training in advance on how to react to arrest or to attack.

Civil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws, as distinguished from a [[constitutional impasse]], in which two public agencies, especially two equally [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[branches of government]], conflict. For instance, if the [[head of government]] of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country's highest court, it would not be civil disobedience, since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen.&lt;ref name=Rex&gt;{{citation|title=Civil Disobedience|author=Rex Martin|publisher=Ethics|volume=80|issue=2|date=Jan 1970|pages=123–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this definition is disputed by Thoreau's political philosophy pitching the conscience vs. the collective. The individual is the final judge of right and wrong. More than this, since only individuals act, only individuals can act unjustly. When the government knocks on the door, it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood. Before Thoreau's imprisonment, when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay, Thoreau had advised, "Resign." If a man chose to be an agent of injustice, then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice. But if government is "the voice of the people," as it is often called, shouldn't that voice be heeded? Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians. Even a good form of government is "liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it." Moreover, even if a government did express the voice of the people, this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said. The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right. What, then, is the proper relationship between the individual and the government?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McElroy|first1=Wendy|title=Henry Thoreau and 'Civil Disobedience'|url=http://thoreau.eserver.org/wendy.html|website=thoreau.eserver.org|publisher=Future of Freedom Foundation|accessdate=5 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918080939/http://thoreau.eserver.org/wendy.html|archivedate=18 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Dworkin]] held that there are three types of civil disobedience:
* "Integrity-based" civil disobedience occurs when a citizen disobeys a law she or he feels is immoral, as in the case of abolitionists disobeying the [[fugitive slave laws]] by refusing to turn over escaped slaves to authorities.
* "Justice-based" civil disobedience occurs when a citizen disobeys laws in order to lay claim to some right denied to her or him, as when blacks illegally protested during the [[civil rights movement]].
* "Policy-based" civil disobedience occurs when a person breaks the law in order to change a policy (s)he believes is dangerously wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Dworkin in Transition|author=Ken Kress and Scott W. Anderson|publisher=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=37|issue=2|date=Spring 1989|pages=337–351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities. Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as [[trade union]]s, [[bank]]s, and [[private universities]] can be justified if it reflects "a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken". The same principle, she argues, applies to breaches of law in protest against [[international organization]]s and foreign governments.&lt;ref name=Brownlee/&gt;

It is usually recognized that lawbreaking, if it is not done publicly, at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience. But Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality, we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking. If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his [[natural right]]s, he might, for instance, find that assisting in [[fabricating evidence]] or committing [[perjury]] is more effective than open disobedience. This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on [[deceit]] in such situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.2307/1122838|title=Lawyering for Justice in a Flawed Democracy|first2=David|last2=Luban|author=Stephen Ellmann|publisher=Columbia Law Review|volume=90|issue=1|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=Jan 1990|pages=116–190|jstor=1122838}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fully Informed Jury Association]]'s publication "A Primer for Prospective Jurors" notes, "Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Gestapo|secret police]] demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://fija.org/docs/BR_2010_QandA_primer.pdf|title=A Primer for Prospective Jurors|publisher=Fully Informed Jury Association|access-date=28 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825163303/http://fija.org/docs/BR_2010_QandA_primer.pdf|archive-date=25 August 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this definition, civil disobedience could be traced back to the [[Book of Exodus]], where [[Shiphrah]] and [[Puah]] refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it. (Exodus 1: 15-19)&lt;ref&gt;Magonet, Jonathan (1992) Bible Lives (London: SCM), 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violent vs. non-violent===
There have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non-violent. [[Black's Law Dictionary]] includes non-violence in its definition of civil disobedience. Christian Bay's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires "carefully chosen and legitimate means," but holds that they do not have to be non-violent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Bay, Christian|title=Civil Disobedience|publisher=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences|volume=II|pages=473–486}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that, while both civil disobedience and [[civil rebellion]] are justified by appeal to [[constitutional defect]]s, rebellion is much more destructive; therefore, the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience, and if one cannot justify civil rebellion, then one cannot justify a civil disobedients' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest. Civil disobedients' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society's tolerance of civil disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Civil Disobedience|author=Stuart M. Brown, Jr.|publisher=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=58|issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher H.&amp;nbsp;J. McCloskey argues that "if violent, intimidatory, coercive disobedience is more effective, it is, other things being equal, more justified than less effective, nonviolent disobedience."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.2307/2106847|title=Conscientious Disobedience of the Law: Its Necessity, Justification, and Problems to Which it Gives Rise|author=H.&amp;nbsp;J. McCloskey|publisher=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=40|issue=4|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=Jun 1980|pages=536–557|jstor=2106847}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his best-selling ''Disobedience and Democracy: Nine Fallacies on Law and Order'',&lt;ref&gt;Davis D. Joyce, ''Howard Zinn: A Radical American Vision'' (Prometheus, 2003), 102-103.  Joyce notes that ''Disobedience and Democracy'' sold 75,000 copies in the late 1960s and was Zinn's best-selling book prior to ''A People's History of the United States''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Zinn]] takes a similar position; Zinn states that while the goals of civil disobedience are generally non-violent,

{{quote|in the inevitable tension accompanying the transition from a violent world to a non-violent one, the choice of means will almost never be pure, and will involve such complexities that the simple distinction between violence and non-violence does not suffice as a guide ... the very acts with which we seek to do good cannot escape the imperfections of the world we are trying to change.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, ''Disobedience and Democracy: Nine Fallacies on Law and Order'' (South End Press edition, 2002), 39-41&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Zinn rejects any "easy and righteous dismissal of violence", noting that Thoreau, the popularizer of the term civil disobedience, approved of the armed insurrection of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]. He also notes that some major civil disobedience campaigns which have been classified as non-violent, such as the [[Birmingham campaign]], have actually included elements of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, ''Disobedience'', 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="press.princeton.edu"&gt;[http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7719.html Howard Zinn, "Introduction" for ''The Higher Law: Thoreau on Civil Disobedience and Reform,'' Wendell Glick, ed., (Princeton University Press, 2004)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401051906/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7719.html |date=2015-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolutionary vs. non-revolutionary===
Non-revolutionary civil disobedience is a simple disobedience of laws on the grounds that they are judged "wrong" by an individual conscience, or as part of an effort to render certain laws ineffective, to cause their repeal, or to exert pressure to get one's political wishes on some other issue. Revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an active attempt to overthrow a government (or to change cultural traditions, social customs, religious beliefs, etc...revolution doesn't have to be political, i.e. "cultural revolution", it simply implies sweeping and widespread change to a section of the social fabric).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Toward an Ethics of Civil Disobedience|author=Harry Prosch|publisher=Ethics|volume=77|issue=3|date=Apr 1967|pages=176–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi's acts have been described as revolutionary civil disobedience.&lt;ref name=Rex/&gt; It has been claimed that the [[Hungarians]] under [[Ferenc Deák]] directed revolutionary civil disobedience against the [[Austrian government]].&lt;ref name=Bedau&gt;{{citation|doi=10.2307/2023542|publisher=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=58|issue=21|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=October 12, 1961|pages=653–665|title=On Civil Disobedience|author=Hugo A. Bedau|jstor=2023542}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thoreau also wrote of civil disobedience accomplishing "peaceable revolution."&lt;ref name=Thoreau/&gt; Howard Zinn, [[Harvey Wheeler]], and others have identified the right espoused in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|US Declaration of Independence]] to "alter or abolish" an unjust government to be a principle of civil disobedience.&lt;ref name="press.princeton.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/hwheeler/constcivdisobed.htm#N_1_|title=Harvey Wheeler: The Constitutionality of Civil Disobedience|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collective vs. solitary===
The earliest recorded incidents of collective civil disobedience took place during the [[Roman Empire]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Unarmed [[Jew]]s gathered in the streets to prevent the installation of pagan images in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}{{Original research inline|date=January 2012}} In modern times, some activists who commit civil disobedience as a group collectively refuse to sign [[bail (law)|bail]] until certain demands are met, such as favourable bail conditions, or the release of all the activists. This is a form of [[jail solidarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Path of Resistance|url=http://taghier.org/books/english/path_e.pdf|author=P Herngren|publisher=The Practice of Civil Disobedience|year=1993|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728081255/http://taghier.org/books/english/path_e.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2012}} There have also been many instances of solitary civil disobedience, such as that committed by Thoreau, but these sometimes go unnoticed. Thoreau, at the time of his arrest, was not yet a well-known author, and his arrest was not covered in any newspapers in the days, weeks and months after it happened. The tax collector who arrested him rose to higher political office, and Thoreau's essay was not published until after the end of the Mexican War.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Gross, Robert A.|title=Quiet War With The State; Henry David Thoreau and Civil Disobedience.|publisher=The Yale Review|date=October 2005|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
{{further|Examples of civil disobedience}}

===Choice of specific act===
Civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts. Hugo A. Bedau writes,
{{quote|There is a whole class of acts, undertaken in the name of civil disobedience, which, even if they were widely practiced, would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance (e.g. trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation)&amp;nbsp;... Such acts are often just a harassment and, at least to the bystander, somewhat inane&amp;nbsp;... The remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity.}}
Bedau also notes, though, that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward [[public policy]] goals may serve a propaganda purpose.&lt;ref name="Bedau"/&gt; Some civil disobedients, such as the proprietors of illegal [[medical cannabis dispensaries]] and Voice in the Wilderness, which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the US government, directly achieve a desired social goal (such as the provision of medication to the sick) while openly breaking the law. [[Julia Butterfly Hill]] lived in [[Luna (Redwood Tree)|Luna]], a {{convert|180|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall, 600-year-old [[California Redwood]] tree for 738 days, successfully preventing it from being cut down.

In cases where the criminalized behaviour is [[pure speech]], civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech. An example would be [[WBAI]]'s broadcasting the track "[[Filthy Words]]" from a [[George Carlin]] comedy album, which eventually led to the 1978 Supreme Court case of ''[[FCC v. Pacifica Foundation]]''. [[Threatening government officials]] is another classic way of expressing defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies. For example, Joseph Haas was arrested for allegedly sending an email to the [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]], city councillors stating, "Wise up or die."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Brown+case+e-mails+investigated&amp;articleId=083dd586-0d54-4650-a9ca-07f99d4d3914|title=Brown case e-mails investigated|date=June 21, 2007|publisher=Union-Leader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, protesters of particular [[victimless crime]]s often see fit to openly commit that crime. Laws against [[public nudity]], for instance, have been [[nudity and protest|protested by going naked in public]], and laws against cannabis consumption have been protested by openly possessing it and using it at cannabis rallies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig8/clark-d5.html |title=Civil Disobedience and the Libertarian Division of Labor |author=Clark, Dick |date=April 22, 2008 |publisher=LewRockwell.com }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some forms of civil disobedience, such as [[illegal boycott]]s, [[refusals to pay taxes]], [[draft dodging]], [[denial-of-service attack|distributed denial-of-service attack]]s, and [[sit-in]]s, make it more difficult for a system to function. In this way, they might be considered coercive.  Brownlee notes that "although civil disobedients are constrained in their use of coercion by their conscientious aim to engage in moral dialogue, nevertheless they may find it necessary to employ limited coercion in order to get their issue onto the table."&lt;ref name=Brownlee&gt;{{citation|title=The communicative aspects of civil disobedience and lawful punishment|author=Kimberley Brownlee|date=9 November 2006|journal=Criminal Law and Philosophy|volume=1|doi=10.1007/s11572-006-9015-9|issue=2|page=179|publisher=Criminal Law and Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Plowshares]] organization temporarily closed [[GCSB Waihopai]] by padlocking the gates and using sickles to deflate one of the large domes covering two satellite dishes.

[[Electronic civil disobedience]] can include [[web site defacement]]s, [[URL redirection|redirect]]s, [[denial-of-service attack]]s, [[information theft]] and [[Internet leak|data leaks]], illegal web site [[parody|parodies]], [[virtual sit-in]]s, and [[virtual sabotage]]. It is distinct from other kinds of [[hacktivism]] in that the perpetrator openly reveals his identity. Virtual actions rarely succeed in completely shutting down their targets, but they often generate significant media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1177/0002716204270338|title=The New Digital Media and Activist Networking within Anti-Corporate Globalization Movements|author=Jeffrey S. Juris|publisher=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=597|pages=189–208|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|issue=Cultural Production in a Digital Age|jstor=25046069|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dilemma action]]s are designed to create a "response dilemma" for public authorities "by forcing them to either concede some public space to protesters or make themselves look absurd or heavy-handed by acting against the protest."&lt;ref name=Moth&gt;Laura Moth, [[Today's Zaman]], 19 June 2013, [https://archive.is/20130620053234/http://www.todayszaman.com/blogNewsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=318666 A standing dilemma in Taksim ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperation with authorities===
[[File:Police officer speaking to demonstrator during civil disobedience action.jpg|thumb|right|A police officer speaks with a demonstrator at a union picket, explaining that she will be arrested if she does not leave the street. The demonstrator was arrested moments later.]]
Some disciplines of civil disobedience hold that the protestor must submit to arrest and cooperate with the authorities. Others advocate falling limp or [[resisting arrest]], especially when it will hinder the police from effectively responding to a mass protest.

Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases. For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a [[consent search]] of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Watts v. Indiana]]'', {{ussc|338|49|1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=The Yale Law Journal|title=A Postscript to the Miranda Project: Interrogation of Draft Protestors|author=John Griffiths and Richard E. Ayres|volume=77|issue=2|date=Dec 1967|pages=300–319|doi=10.2307/795080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote,
{{quote|My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with—for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel—and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action.&lt;ref name=Thoreau&gt;Thoreau, Henry David. ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the [[social contract]], which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established, or else suffer the penalties set out in the law. Other civil disobedients who favour the existence of government still don't believe in the legitimacy of their particular government, or don't believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted. And still other civil disobedients, being anarchists, don't believe in the legitimacy of any government, and therefore see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others.

===Choice of plea===
An important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to [[plead guilty]]. There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://freestateproject.org/news/issues/civil_disobedience.php|title=Rules for Engaging in Civil Disobedience|publisher=Free State Project|access-date=17 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613110110/http://freestateproject.org/news/issues/civil_disobedience.php|archive-date=13 June 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. [[ACT UP]]'s Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, "Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged," but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, "Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty." A plea of [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.actupny.org/documents/CDdocuments/ACTUP_CivilDisobedience.pdf|title=Civil Disobedience Training|publisher=ACT UP|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; One defendant accused of illegally protesting [[nuclear power]], when asked to enter his plea, stated, "I plead for the beauty that surrounds us";&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Hurst, John|year=1978|title=A-plant protesters being freed|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is known as a "creative plea," and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty.&lt;ref name=NLG/&gt;

When the Committee for Non-Violent Action sponsored a protest in August 1957, at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas, Nevada, 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest. At a pre-arranged announced time, one at a time they stepped across the "line" and were immediately arrested. They were put on a bus and taken to the Nye County seat of Tonopah, Nevada, and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace, that afternoon. A well known civil rights attorney, Francis Heisler, had volunteered to defend the arrested persons, advising them to plead ''[[nolo contendere]]'', as an alternative to pleading either guilty or not-guilty. The arrested persons were found guilty nevertheless and given suspended sentences, conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Howard Zinn writes,
{{quote|There may be many times when protesters ''choose'' to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice. But that is different than the notion that they ''must'' go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience. The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail, or by evading it. To accept jail penitently as an accession to "the rules" is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience, to demean the seriousness of the protest&amp;nbsp;... In particular, the [[neo-conservative]] insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, ''Disobedience and Disorder: Nine Fallacies on Law and Order,'' cited in {{citation|title=On Civil Disobedience in Recent American Democratic Thought|author=Paul F. Power|publisher=The American Political Science Review|volume=64|issue=1|date=Mar 1970|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sometimes the prosecution proposes a [[plea bargain]] to civil disobedients, as in the case of the [[Camden 28]], in which the defendants were offered an opportunity to plead guilty to one misdemeanour count and receive no jail time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Mirelle Cohen|title=The Camden 28 (review)|journal=Teaching Sociology|volume=35|issue=4|date=Oct 2007|pages=391–392|doi=10.1177/0092055x0703500423}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[mass arrest]] situations, the activists decide to use [[solidarity]] tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone.&lt;ref name=NLG&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nlg-la.org/index_files/cd_questions.pdf|title=Questions and Answers about Civil Disobedience and the Legal Process|author=National Lawyers Guild, LA Chapter|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727003254/http://www.nlg-la.org/index_files/cd_questions.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But some activists have opted to enter a [[blind plea]], pleading guilty without any plea agreement in place. Mahatma Gandhi pleaded guilty and told the court, "I am here to&amp;nbsp;... submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Three Principles of Civil Disobedience: Thoreau, Gandhi, and King|publisher=Lewiston Morning Tribune|date=January 15, 2006|author=Nick Gier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choice of allocution===
Some civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech, or a speech explaining their actions, in [[allocution]]. In ''U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar'', a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on US Navy property argued to the court in allocution that "the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the Navy". As a result, the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days. This action was upheld because, according to the [[US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]], her statement suggested a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|url=http://openjurist.org/275/f3d/23/united-states-of-america-v-norma-burgos-andjar|vol=275|reporter=F.3d|opinion=23|litigants=United States of America v. Norma Burgos-Andjar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prosario-2000.0catch.com/Politics/allocution.htm|title=Allocution|website=prosario-2000.0catch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim DeChristopher]] gave an allocution statement to the court describing the US as "a place where the rule of law was created through acts of civil disobedience" and arguing, "Since those bedrock acts of civil disobedience by our founding fathers, the rule of law in this country has continued to grow closer to our shared higher moral code through the civil disobedience that drew attention to legalized injustice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grist.org/climate-energy/2011-07-27-tim-dechristophers-statement-to-the-court/|title=Tim DeChristopher's statement to the court|date=28 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal implications of civil disobedience==
[[Steven Barkan]] writes that if defendants plead not guilty, "they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine, or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience." A [[technical defence]] may enhance the chances for acquittal, but increase the possibility of additional proceedings as well as reduced press coverage. During the [[Vietnam War]] era, the [[Chicago Eight]] used a [[political defence]], while [[Benjamin Spock trial|Benjamin Spock]] used a technical defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Strategic, Tactical and Organizational Dilemmas of the Protest Movement against Nuclear Power|author=Steven E. Barkan|authorlink=Steven Barkan|publisher=Social Problems|volume=27|issue=1|date=Oct 1979|pages=19–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries such as the United States, whose laws guarantee the right to a [[jury trial]] but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes, some civil disobedients seek [[jury nullification]]. Over the years, this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as ''[[Sparf v. United States]]'', which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative, and ''[[United States v. Dougherty]]'', which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification.

Governments have generally not recognized the legitimacy of civil disobedience or viewed political objectives as an excuse for breaking the law. Specifically, the law usually distinguishes between [[criminal motive]] and [[intention (criminal law)|criminal intent]]; the offender's motives or purposes may be admirable and praiseworthy, but his intent may still be criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Reconstructing the Criminal Defenses: The Significance of Justification|author=Thomas Morawetz|publisher=The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (1973-)|volume=77|issue=2|date=Summer 1986|pages=277–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the saying that "if there is any possible justification of civil disobedience it must come from outside the legal system."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Arthur W. Munk|title=Civil Disobedience: Conscience, Tactics, and the Law|publisher=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=397|date=Sep 1971|pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory is that, while disobedience may be helpful, any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit. Therefore, conscientious lawbreakers must be punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Legal Toleration of Civil Disobedience|author=Robert T.

{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2017}}
'''Computational complexity theory''' focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating these classes to each other. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.

A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical [[models of computation]] to study these problems and quantifying their [[computational complexity]], i.e., the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other measures of complexity are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in [[communication complexity]]), the number of [[logic gate|gates]] in a circuit (used in [[circuit complexity]]) and the number of processors (used in [[parallel computing]]). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do. The [[P versus NP problem]], one of the seven [[Millenium Prize Problems]], is dedicated to the field of computational complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=P vs NP Problem {{!}} Clay Mathematics Institute |url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/p-vs-np-problem |website=www.claymath.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Closely related fields in theoretical computer science are [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[computability theory]]. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kind of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.

==Computational problems==
[[Image:TSP Deutschland 3.png|thumb|333px|A traveling salesman tour through 14 German cities.]]

===Problem instances===
A [[computational problem]] can be viewed as an infinite collection of ''instances'' together with a ''solution'' for every instance. The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance, and should not be confused with the problem itself. In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. For example, consider the problem of [[primality testing]]. The instance is a number (e.g., 15) and the solution is "yes" if the number is prime and "no" otherwise (in this case, 15 is not prime and the answer is "no"). Stated another way, the ''instance'' is a particular input to the problem, and the ''solution'' is the output corresponding to the given input.

To further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the [[traveling salesman problem]]: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany's 15 largest cities? The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through all sites in [[Milan]] whose total length is at most 10&amp;nbsp;km. For this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.

===Representing problem instances===
When considering computational problems, a problem instance is a [[string (computer science)|string]] over an [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]. Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are [[bitstring]]s. As in a real-world [[computer]], mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded. For example, [[integer]]s can be represented in [[binary notation]], and [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s can be encoded directly via their [[adjacency matrix|adjacency matrices]], or by encoding their [[adjacency list]]s in binary.

Even though some proofs of complexity-theoretic theorems regularly assume some concrete choice of input encoding, one tries to keep the discussion abstract enough to be independent of the choice of encoding. This can be achieved by ensuring that different representations can be transformed into each other efficiently.

===Decision problems as formal languages===
[[Image:Decision Problem.svg|thumb|200px|A [[decision problem]] has only two possible outputs, ''yes'' or ''no'' (or alternately 1 or 0) on any input.]]
[[Decision problem]]s are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory. A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either ''yes'' or ''no'', or alternately either 1 or 0. A decision problem can be viewed as a [[formal language]], where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes, and the non-members are those instances whose output is no. The objective is to decide, with the aid of an [[algorithm]], whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration. If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer ''yes'', the algorithm is said to accept the input string, otherwise it is said to reject the input.

An example of a decision problem is the following. The input is an arbitrary [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. The problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is [[connectivity (graph theory)|connected]], or not. The formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs — to obtain a precise definition of this language, one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings.

===Function problems===
A [[function problem]] is a computational problem where a single output (of a [[total function]]) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a [[decision problem]]—that is, the output isn't just yes or no. Notable examples include the [[traveling salesman problem]] and the [[integer factorization problem]].

It is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems. However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems. For example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c'') such that the relation ''a''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' holds. Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.

===Measuring the size of an instance===
To measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem, one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem. However, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance. In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve. Thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance. This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits. Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size. For instance, in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected, how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with 2''n'' vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with ''n'' vertices?

If the input size is ''n'', the time taken can be expressed as a function of ''n''. Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different, the worst-case time complexity T(''n'') is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size ''n''. If T(''n'') is a polynomial in ''n'', then the algorithm is said to be a [[polynomial time]] algorithm. [[Cobham's thesis]] argues that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm.

==Machine models and complexity measures==

===Turing machine===
[[File:Turing machine 2b.svg|thumb|right|300px|An illustration of a Turing machine]]
{{main|Turing machine}}
A Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a general model of a computing machine—anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a [[RAM machine]], [[Conway's Game of Life]], [[cellular automata]] or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.

Many types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes, such as [[deterministic Turing machine]]s, [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s, [[non-deterministic Turing machine]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[symmetric Turing machine]]s and [[alternating Turing machine]]s. They are all equally powerful in principle, but when resources (such as time or space) are bounded, some of these may be more powerful than others.

A deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions. A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random bits. The ability to make probabilistic decisions often helps algorithms solve problems more efficiently. Algorithms that use random bits are called [[randomized algorithm]]s. A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state. One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem in any of these branches, it is said to have solved the problem. Clearly, this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model, it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes. For examples, see [[non-deterministic algorithm]].

===Other machine models===
Many machine models different from the standard [[Turing machine equivalents#Multi-tape Turing machines|multi-tape Turing machines]] have been proposed in the literature, for example [[random access machine]]s. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Arora|Barak|2009|loc=Chapter 1: The computational model and why it doesn't matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; What all these models have in common is that the machines operate [[deterministic algorithm|deterministically]].

However, some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources. For example, a non-deterministic Turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once. The non-deterministic Turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that [[non-deterministic time]] is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems.

===Complexity measures===
For a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the [[deterministic Turing machine]] is used. The ''time required'' by a deterministic Turing machine ''M'' on input ''x'' is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer ("yes" or "no"). A Turing machine ''M'' is said to operate within time ''f''(''n''), if the time required by ''M'' on each input of length ''n'' is at most ''f''(''n''). A decision problem ''A'' can be solved in time ''f''(''n'') if there exists a Turing machine operating in time ''f''(''n'') that solves the problem. Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria. For instance, the set of problems solvable within time ''f''(''n'') on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by [[DTIME]](''f''(''n'')).

Analogous definitions can be made for space requirements. Although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources, any [[Complexity|complexity measure]] can be viewed as a computational resource. Complexity measures are very generally defined by the [[Blum complexity axioms]]. Other complexity measures used in complexity theory include [[communication complexity]], [[circuit complexity]], and [[decision tree complexity]].

The complexity of an algorithm is often expressed using [[big O notation]].

===Best, worst and average case complexity===
[[File:Sorting quicksort anim.gif|thumb|250px|Visualization of the [[quicksort]] [[algorithm]] that has [[Best, worst and average case|average case performance]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The [[best, worst and average case]] complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity (or any other complexity measure) of different inputs of the same size. Since some inputs of size ''n'' may be faster to solve than others, we define the following complexities:
#Best-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the best input of size ''n''.
#Average-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem on an average. This complexity is only defined with respect to a [[probability distribution]] over the inputs. For instance, if all inputs of the same size are assumed to be equally likely to appear, the average case complexity can be defined with respect to the uniform distribution over all inputs of size ''n''.
#[[Amortized analysis]]: Amortized analysis considers both the costly and less costly operations together over the whole series of operations of the algorithm.
#Worst-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the worst input of size ''n''.
The order from cheap to costly is: Best, average (of [[discrete uniform distribution]]), amortized, worst.

For example, consider the deterministic sorting algorithm [[quicksort]]. This solves the problem of sorting a list of integers that is given as the input. The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm takes time [[Big O notation|O]](''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for this case. If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is O(''n'' log ''n''). The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing O(''n'' log ''n'') time.

===Upper and lower bounds on the complexity of problems===
To classify the computation time (or similar resources, such as space consumption), one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the maximum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem. The complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worst-case complexity, unless specified otherwise. Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of [[analysis of algorithms]]. To show an upper bound ''T''(''n'') on the time complexity of a problem, one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most ''T''(''n''). However, proving lower bounds is much more difficult, since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem. The phrase "all possible algorithms" includes not just the algorithms known today, but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future. To show a lower bound of ''T''(''n'') for a problem requires showing that no algorithm can have time complexity lower than ''T''(''n'').

Upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the [[big O notation]], which hides constant factors and smaller terms. This makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used. For instance, if ''T''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;15''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;40, in big O notation one would write ''T''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Complexity classes==
{{main|Complexity class}}

===Defining complexity classes===
A '''complexity class''' is a set of problems of related complexity. Simpler complexity classes are defined by the following factors:
* The type of computational problem: The most commonly used problems are decision problems. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s, [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s, [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.
* The model of computation: The most common model of computation is the deterministic Turing machine, but many complexity classes are based on non-deterministic Turing machines, [[Boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.
* The resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds: These two properties are usually stated together, such as "polynomial time", "logarithmic space", "constant depth", etc.

Some complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework. Thus, a typical complexity class has a definition like the following:

:The set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within time ''f''(''n''). (This complexity class is known as DTIME(''f''(''n'')).)

But bounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham-Edmonds thesis]] states that "the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class [[P (complexity)|P]], which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is [[FP (complexity)|FP]].

===Important complexity classes===

[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|250px|thumb|right|A representation of the relation among complexity classes]]

It turns out that PSPACE = NPSPACE and EXPSPACE = NEXPSPACE by [[Savitch's theorem]].

Other important complexity classes include [[BPP (complexity)|BPP]], [[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]] and [[RP (complexity)|RP]], which are defined using [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s; [[AC (complexity)|AC]] and [[NC (complexity)|NC]], which are defined using Boolean circuits; and [[BQP]] and [[QMA]], which are defined using quantum Turing machines. [[Sharp-P|#P]] is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems). Classes like [[IP (complexity)|IP]] and [[AM (complexity)|AM]] are defined using [[Interactive proof system]]s. [[ALL (complexity)|ALL]] is the class of all decision problems.

===Hierarchy theorems===
{{main|time hierarchy theorem|space hierarchy theorem}}
For the complexity classes defined in this way, it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems. In particular, although DTIME(''n'') is contained in DTIME(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.

More precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{DTIME}\big(f(n) \big) \subsetneq \mathsf{DTIME} \big(f(n) \sdot \log^{2}(f(n)) \big)&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{DSPACE}\big(f(n)\big) \subsetneq \mathsf{DSPACE} \big(f(n) \sdot \log(f(n)) \big)&lt;/math&gt;.

The time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that P is strictly contained in EXPTIME, and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that L is strictly contained in PSPACE.

===Reduction===
{{main|Reduction (complexity)}}
Many complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at most as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as Cook reductions, Karp reductions and Levin reductions, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.

The most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.

This motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems ''C'' if every problem in ''C'' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in ''C'' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in ''C''. The notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of [[NP-hard]] problems.

If a problem ''X'' is in ''C'' and hard for ''C'', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for ''C''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in ''C''. (Since many problems could be equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in ''C''.) Thus the class of [[NP-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, Π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to another problem, Π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an [[NP-complete]] problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP.&lt;ref name="Sipser2006"/&gt;

==Important open problems==
[[Image:Complexity classes.svg|thumb|250px|Diagram of complexity classes provided that P&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;NP. The existence of problems in NP outside both P and NP-complete in this case was established by Ladner.&lt;ref name="Ladner75"&gt;{{Citation|last=Ladner|first=Richard E.|title=On the structure of polynomial time reducibility|journal=[[Journal of the ACM]] |volume=22|year=1975|pages=151–171|doi=10.1145/321864.321877|issue=1|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===P versus NP problem===
{{Main|P versus NP problem}}

The complexity class P is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm. This hypothesis is called the [[Cobham–Edmonds thesis]]. The complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]], on the other hand, contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently, but for which no efficient algorithm is known, such as the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], the [[Hamiltonian path problem]] and the [[vertex cover problem]]. Since deterministic Turing machines are special non-deterministic Turing machines, it is easily observed that each problem in P is also member of the class NP.

The question of whether P equals NP is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science because of the wide implications of a solution.&lt;ref name="Sipser2006"&gt;See {{harvnb|Sipser|2006|loc= Chapter 7: Time complexity}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the answer is yes, many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions. These include various types of [[integer programming]] problems in [[operations research]], many problems in [[logistics]], [[protein structure prediction]] in [[biology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Protein folding in the hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) model is NP-complete|last=Berger|first=Bonnie A.|author1-link=Bonnie Berger|journal=Journal of Computational Biology|year=1998|volume=5|pages=27–40|pmid=9541869|doi=10.1089/cmb.1998.5.27|last2=Leighton|first2=T|author2-link=F.

===Problems in NP not known to be in P or NP-complete===
It was shown by Ladner that if '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' then there exist problems in '''NP''' that are neither in '''P''' nor '''NP-complete'''.&lt;ref name="Ladner75" /&gt; Such problems are called [[NP-intermediate]] problems. The [[graph isomorphism problem]], the [[discrete logarithm problem]] and the [[integer factorization problem]] are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate. They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in '''P''' or to be '''NP-complete'''.

The [[graph isomorphism problem]] is the computational problem of determining whether two finite [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]]. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in '''P''', '''NP-complete''', or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete.&lt;ref name="AK06"&gt;{{Citation

The best algorithm for this problem, due to [[László Babai]] and [[Eugene Luks]] has run time &lt;math&gt;O(2^{\sqrt{n \log n}})&lt;/math&gt; for graphs with ''n'' vertices, although some recent work by Babai offers some potentially new perspectives on this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Babai |first=László |date=2016 |title=Graph Isomorphism in Quasipolynomial Time |eprint=1512.03547 |class=cs.DS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[integer factorization problem]] is the computational problem of determining the [[prime factorization]] of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a prime factor less than ''k''. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in '''NP''' and in '''co-NP''' (and even in UP and co-UP&lt;ref&gt;[[Lance Fortnow]]. Computational Complexity Blog: Complexity Class of the Week: Factoring. September 13, 2002. http://weblog.fortnow.com/2002/09/complexity-class-of-week-factoring.html&lt;/ref&gt;). If the problem is '''NP-complete''', the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., '''NP''' will equal '''co-NP'''). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the [[general number field sieve]], which takes time &lt;math&gt;O(e^{\left(\frac{64}{9}\right)^{1/3}(\log n)^{1/3}(\log \log n)^{2/3}})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram MathWorld: [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NumberFieldSieve.html Number Field Sieve]&lt;/ref&gt; to factor an integer ''n''. However, the best known [[quantum algorithm]] for this problem, [[Shor's algorithm]], does run in polynomial time. Unfortunately, this fact doesn't say much about where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.

===Separations between other complexity classes===
Many known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal, but this has not been proved. For instance '''P''' ⊆ '''NP''' ⊆ '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''' ⊆ '''PSPACE''', but it is possible that '''P''' = '''PSPACE'''. If '''P''' is not equal to '''NP''', then '''P''' is not equal to '''PSPACE''' either. Since there are many known complexity classes between '''P''' and '''PSPACE''', such as '''RP''', '''BPP''', '''PP''', '''BQP''', '''MA''', '''PH''', etc., it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class. Proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory.

Along the same lines, '''[[co-NP]]''' is the class containing the [[Complement (complexity)|complement]] problems (i.e. problems with the ''yes''/''no'' answers reversed) of '''NP''' problems. It is believed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos522/ Boaz Barak's course on Computational Complexity] [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos522/lec2.pdf Lecture 2]&lt;/ref&gt; that '''NP''' is not equal to '''co-NP'''; however, it has not yet been proven. It is clear that if these two complexity classes are not equal then '''P''' is not equal to '''NP''', since if '''P'''='''NP''' we would also have '''P'''='''co-NP''', since problems in '''NP''' are dual to those in '''co-NP'''.

Similarly, it is not known if '''L''' (the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space) is strictly contained in '''P''' or equal to '''P'''. Again, there are many complexity classes between the two, such as '''NL''' and '''NC''', and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes.

It is suspected that '''P''' and '''BPP''' are equal. However, it is currently open if '''BPP''' = '''NEXP'''.

{{wikt|tractable|feasible|intractability|infeasible}}
A problem that can be solved in theory (e.g. given large but finite resources, especially time), but for which in practice ''any'' solution takes too many resources to be useful, is known as an '''{{visible anchor|intractable problem}}'''.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, J.E., Motwani, R. and Ullman, J.D. (2007) [[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]], Addison Wesley, Boston/San Francisco/New York (page 368)&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a problem that can be solved in practice is called a '''{{visible anchor|tractable problem}}''', literally "a problem that can be handled". The term ''[[wikt:infeasible|infeasible]]'' (literally "cannot be done") is sometimes used interchangeably with ''[[wikt:intractable|intractable]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Algorithms and Complexity |first=Gerard |last=Meurant |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-08093391-7 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6WriBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=computational+feasibility+tractability p. 4]}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this risks confusion with a [[feasible solution]] in [[mathematical optimization]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tractable problems are frequently identified with problems that have polynomial-time solutions ('''P''', '''PTIME'''); this is known as the [[Cobham–Edmonds thesis]]. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are [[EXPTIME]]-hard. If NP is not the same as P, then [[NP-hard]] problems are also intractable in this sense.

However, this identification is inexact: a polynomial-time solution with large exponent or large constant term grows quickly, and may be impractical for practical size problems; conversely, an exponential-time solution that grows slowly may be practical on realistic input, or a solution that takes a long time in the worst case may take a short time in most cases or the average case, and thus still be practical. Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in [[Presburger arithmetic]] has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete [[knapsack problem]] over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and [[SAT solver]]s routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete [[Boolean satisfiability problem]].

To see why exponential-time algorithms are generally unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; operations before halting. For small ''n'', say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; operations each second, the program would run for about 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years, which is the same order of magnitude as the [[age of the universe]]. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. However, an exponential-time algorithm that takes 1.0001&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; operations is practical until ''n'' gets relatively large.

Similarly, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, ''n''&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances. Indeed, in practice even ''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; algorithms are often impractical on realistic sizes of problems.

==History==
An early example of algorithm complexity analysis is the running time analysis of the [[Euclidean algorithm]] done by [[Gabriel Lamé]] in 1844.

Before the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off, numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers. Most influential among these was the definition of Turing machines by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936, which turned out to be a very robust and flexible simplification of a computer.

The beginning of systematic studies in computational complexity is attributed to the seminal 1965 paper "On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms" by [[Juris Hartmanis]] and [[Richard E. Stearns]], which laid out the definitions of [[time complexity]] and [[space complexity]], and proved the hierarchy theorems.&lt;ref name="Fortnow 2003"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Fortnow|Homer|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in 1965 [[Jack Edmonds|Edmonds]] suggested to consider a "good" algorithm to be one with running time bounded by a polynomial of the input size.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Karp, "[http://cecas.clemson.edu/~shierd/Shier/MthSc816/turing-karp.pdf Combinatorics, Complexity, and Randomness]", 1985 Turing Award Lecture&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier papers studying problems solvable by Turing machines with specific bounded resources include&lt;ref name="Fortnow 2003"/&gt; [[John Myhill]]'s definition of [[linear bounded automata]] (Myhill 1960), [[Raymond Smullyan]]'s study of rudimentary sets (1961), as well as [[Hisao Yamada]]'s paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yamada | first1 = H. | title = Real-Time Computation and Recursive Functions Not Real-Time Computable | journal = IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers | volume = EC-11 | issue = 6 | pages = 753–760 | year = 1962 | doi = 10.1109/TEC.1962.5219459}}&lt;/ref&gt; on real-time computations (1962). Somewhat earlier, [[Boris Trakhtenbrot]] (1956), a pioneer in the field from the USSR, studied another specific complexity measure.&lt;ref&gt;Trakhtenbrot, B.A.: Signalizing functions and tabular operators. Uchionnye Zapiski
Penzenskogo Pedinstituta (Transactions of the Penza Pedagogoical Institute) 4, 75–87 (1956) (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; As he remembers:

{{quote|However, [my] initial interest [in automata theory] was increasingly set aside in favor of computational complexity, an exciting fusion of combinatorial methods, inherited from [[switching theory]], with the conceptual arsenal of the theory of algorithms. These ideas had occurred to me earlier in 1955 when I coined the term "signalizing function", which is nowadays commonly known as "complexity measure".&lt;ref&gt;Boris Trakhtenbrot, "From Logic to Theoretical Computer Science – An Update". In: ''Pillars of Computer Science'', LNCS 4800, Springer 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1967, [[Manuel Blum]] formulated a set of [[axiom]]s (now known as [[Blum axioms]]) specifying desirable properties of complexity measures on the set of computable functions and proved an important result, the so-called [[Blum's speedup theorem|speed-up theorem]]. The field began to flourish in 1971 when the [[Stephen Cook]] and [[Leonid Levin]] [[Cook–Levin theorem|proved]] the existence of practically relevant problems that are [[NP-complete]]. In 1972, [[Richard Karp]] took this idea a leap forward with his landmark paper, "Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems", in which he showed that 21 diverse [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] and [[graph theory|graph theoretical]] problems, each infamous for its computational intractability, are NP-complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Richard M.

In the 1980s, much work was done on the average difficulty of solving NP-complete problems—both exactly and approximately. At that time, computational complexity theory was at its height, and it was widely believed that if a problem turned out to be NP-complete, then there was little chance of being able to work with the problem in a practical situation. However, it became increasingly clear that this is not always the case, and some authors claimed that general asymptotic results are often unimportant for typical problems arising in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1143|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Glass was born in the [[East End]] of [[London]], [[England]], the son of a tailor, ande attended a state elementary school and [[Raine's Grammar School]]. He then took a degree from the LSE in 1931.

From 1932–1940 he was a research assistant to [[William Beveridge]] and statistician, [[Arthur Bowley]].

In 1935 he was a research assistant with [[Lancelot Hogben]] in the department of Social Biology at the LSE. At this time he came into contact with [[R. R. Kuczynski]]. After Hogben's departure and the closing of the department in 1937, he was heavily involved in founding the [[Population Investigation Committee]] (PIC).

In 1948 he became professor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=COLL+MISC+0731 Archives.lse.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1961-1978 he was Martin White professor of sociology at the [[London School of Economics]].

He died in 1978 from a [[coronary thrombosis]] and was survived by his wife [[Ruth Glass]], the urban sociologist.

'''Death in Norse paganism''' was associated with varying customs and beliefs. Not only could a [[Viking funeral]] be performed a number of ways, the idea of the soul was associated with various notions, as well as of where the dead went in their [[afterlife]], such as [[Valhalla]], [[Fólkvangr]], [[Hel (location)|Hel]], and ''[[#Helgafjell|Helgafjell]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==The soul==
The Norse concept of the soul held that it was composed of several separate parts:
*the ''hamr'' (appearance, conceived of having a spiritual element that could be manipulated magically)&lt;ref name="norsemythos"&gt;McCoy, Daniel (2014-10). The Self and Its Parts. Norse Mythology for Smart People, October 2014. Retrieved from https://norse-mythology.org/concepts/the-parts-of-the-self/&lt;/ref&gt;
*the ''hugr'' (mind, emotions, will)&lt;ref name="norsemythos"/&gt;
*the ''[[fylgja]]'' (attendant spirit)
*the ''[[hamingja]]'' (potentiality or fate)

The ''hamingja'' could leave the person during life, and be inherited by another member of the lineage after death. The ''fylgja'' could also travel away from the body during life. Through magical practices, such as ''spa'' or ''seidr'', some aspect of the mind could [[Astral projection|leave the body]] during moments of unconsciousness, [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]], [[trance]], or sleep.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The ''hugr'' was generally conceived of as leaving the body on death, potentially only after the body was fully destroyed through decay or immolation. When the body had been broken down, the soul could start its journey to the realm of the dead.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The last breath a person took was understood to be an evaporation of the life principle into a source of life that was primeval and common, and which was in the world of the gods, nature, and the universe.&lt;ref name="Gräslund11"&gt;Gräslund 2000:11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funeral==
{{main |Norse funeral}}
The grave goods had to be subjected to the same treatment as the body, if they were to accompany the dead person to the afterlife. If a person were immolated, then the grave goods had to be burnt as well, and if the deceased was to be interred, the objects were interred together with him.&lt;ref name="Gräslund11"/&gt;

The usual grave for a [[thrall]] was probably not much more than a hole in the ground.&lt;ref name="steins84"&gt;Steinsland &amp; Meulengracht Sørensen 1998:84&lt;/ref&gt; He was probably buried in such a way as to ensure both that he did not return to haunt his masters and that he could be of use to his masters after they died. Slaves were sometimes sacrificed to be useful in the next life.&lt;ref name="Gräslund11"/&gt;

A free man was usually given weapons and equipment for riding. An artisan, such as a blacksmith, could receive his entire set of tools. Women were provided with their jewelry and often with tools for female and household activities. The most sumptuous Viking funeral discovered so far is the [[Oseberg ship]] burial, which was for a woman, obviously of elevated social status, who lived in the [[9th century]] CE.&lt;ref name="steins84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="steins85"&gt;Steinsland &amp; Meulengracht Sørensen 1998:85&lt;/ref&gt;

It was common to burn the corpse and the grave offerings on a [[pyre]], in which the temperature reached {{convert|1400|C|K}}, which is significantly higher than used for modern [[cremation|crematorium furnace]]s (around {{convert|920|C|K}}). All that would remain was some incinerated fragments of metal and some animal and human bones. The pyre was constructed so that the pillar of smoke would be as massive as possible in order to elevate the deceased to the afterlife.&lt;ref name="Gräslund12"&gt;Gräslund 2000:12&lt;/ref&gt;

On the seventh day after the person had died, people celebrated the ''sjaund'', or the funeral ale that the feast also was called since it involved a [[Symbel|ritual drinking]]. The funeral ale was a way of socially demarcating the case of death. It was only after the funeral ale that the heirs could rightfully claim their inheritance.&lt;ref name="steins86"&gt;Steinsland &amp; Meulengracht Sørensen 1998:86&lt;/ref&gt; If the deceased were a widow or the master of the homestead, the rightful heir could assume the high seat and thereby mark the shift in authority.&lt;ref name="steins87"&gt;Steinsland &amp; Meulengracht Sørensen 1998:87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestor worship==
The grave is often described as an abode for the dead, and it was also the location of [[ancestor worship|cultic rites]]. The tradition of putting out food and beer on the tumulus has survived into modern times, in some parts of [[Scandinavia]]. This tradition is a remainder of the [[ancestor worship]] which was common during early Norse culture. If the dead were taken care of, they would in return protect the homestead and its people, and provide for its fertility.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Afterlife==
The ancestor worship of ancient Scandinavians appears to contradict another idea, specifically that the deceased departed on a voyage to the realm of the dead, a realm which could be situated inside the mountain, on the other side of the sea, in the heavens, or in the underworld.&lt;ref name="steins90"&gt;Steinsland &amp; Meulengracht Sørensen 1998:90&lt;/ref&gt; No logical connection has been identified between these two complexes of ideas, and scholars do not have any answers to the question whether the dead would remain for some time in the grave and later depart for the realm of the dead, what the purpose of the grave goods was, or if the ship in the barrow was to transport the deceased to the realm of the dead.&lt;ref name="steins91"&gt;Steinsland &amp; Meulengracht Sørensen 1998:91&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helgafjell===
''Helgafjell'', the "holy mountain", was one idea of the afterlife which appears in West Norse sources. This mountain could be a mountain formation in the vicinity, and it was so sacred that people could not look in its direction without washing their face first. In the holy mountain, the members of the [[Norse clans]] would lead lives similar to the ones they had lived in the world of the living. Some psychic people could look into the mountain and what they saw was not intimidating, but instead it was a scene with a warm hearth, drinking, and talking.&lt;ref name="steins91"/&gt;

===Hel===
{{main |Hel (being) |Hel (location)}}
This conception is in stark contrast to [[Hel (location)|Hel's realm]], the subterranean abode ruled by its eponymous blue and black giantess [[Hel (being)|Hel]]. Within or near Hel's realm was [[Náströnd]], described as a place of darkness and horror. Hel's realm is separated from the world of the living by [[Gjöll|a rapid river]] across which leads the [[Gjallarbrú]] that the dead have to pass. The gates are heavy, and close behind those who pass it and will never return again. Hel is the final destination of those who do not die in battle, but of old age or disease. Scholars believe that the ideas of Hel influenced Early Medieval Christianity, which taught of a realm of punishment in contrast to [[paradise]]. The word ''Helviti'', which still is the name of Hell in [[North Germanic languages|modern Scandinavian languages]], means "Hel's punishment". It is not certain that the notion of Hel was very dark and dreary to pagan Scandinavians. In ''[[Baldrs draumar]]'', we learn that Hel had decorated a lavish feasting table when she waited for [[Baldr]] to enter her halls. Still, it was probably not a very attractive destination, as the sagas tell of warriors who cut themselves with spears before dying in order to trick Hel into thinking that they had died heroic deaths in battle.&lt;ref name="steins91"/&gt;

===Valhalla===
{{main |Valhalla}}
[[Valhalla]] is an afterlife destination where half of those who die in battle gather as [[einherjar]], a retinue gathered for one sole purpose: to remain fit for battle in preparation for the last great battle, during [[Ragnarök]]. In opposition to Hel's realm, which was a subterranean realm of the dead, it appears that Valhalla was located somewhere in the heavens. [[Odin]]'s kingdom was primarily an abode for men, and the women who live there are the [[valkyrie]]s who gather the fallen warriors on the battle field and bring them to Odin's hall, where they pour mead for them.&lt;ref name="steins91"/&gt;

Little information is known on where women went, but both Helgafjell and Hel's realm must have been open for women, and the lavish gifts that could be bestowed on dead women show that they were understood to have an afterlife as well.&lt;ref name="steins92"&gt;Steinsland &amp; Meulengracht Sørensen 1998:92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fólkvangr===
{{main |Fólkvangr}}
[[Fólkvangr]] is an afterlife field ruled over by the goddess [[Freyja]], who chooses half of those who die in battle to reside with her there. According to the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' poem ''[[Grímnismál]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Fôlkvang is the ninth, there Freyia directs
:the sittings in the hall.
:She half the fallen chooses each day,
:but Odin th' other half.&lt;ref name=THORPE21&gt;Thorpe (1907:21).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death and sexual rites==
[[File:Bildstein-Bunge 1.jpg |thumb |200px |The phallic [[Stora Hammars stones|Stora Hammars I stone]].]]
Early sources have an additional complex of beliefs which is connected with the afterlife: death could be described as an erotic embrace between the dead man and a lady who represents the afterlife. This lady was often [[Hel (being)|Hel]], but it could also be [[Rán]] who received those who died at sea. [[Daughters of Ægir|Rán's nine daughters]] are also depicted as erotic partners in death. There is good reason to believe that such erotic elements are not just [[skald]]ic playfulness, but authentic pagan notions, since they appear in the oldest known [[Old Norse poetry|skaldic poems]]. In the 9th century poem ''[[Ynglingatal]]'', the kings are said in several stanzas to be in "Hel's embrace". Several skaldic poems and sagas describe death in battle or on the sea with erotic terminology. The skald praises the brave sea warrior who fights in vain against the natural forces, but who finally has to give up, and then he enters Rán's bed or is embraced by her nine daughters.&lt;ref name="steins92"/&gt;

Several of [[Gotland]]'s [[image stone]]s show scenes alluding to death and eroticism, and the stones are {{convert|2|to|3|m|cm|adj=on}} tall [[phallos|phallic]] memorial stones in remembrance of the dead. The stones have richly decorated surfaces and they often have a certain [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] in the upper field: a welcoming scene in the realm of the dead between a man and a lady. The lady offers a [[drinking horn]] to the man who arrives on [[Sleipnir]]. It is the man's phallic shape, among other things, which allows us to connect the images to the literary sources. The scene could depict the deceased who is united with Hel or with Rán. It is primarily kings and chieftains who are portrayed with an erotic death, but also the death of a hero can be portrayed in the same way.&lt;ref name="steins92"/&gt;

The connection between death and eroticism is probably ancient in Scandinavia, and to this testify numerous "white stones", great phallic stones that were raised on the barrows. The tradition goes back to the 5th century, and in total 40 such stones have been discovered, mostly on Norway's southwestern coast. It is possible that death required an extra portion of fertility and eroticism, but also that the living received life force from the dead. The thought might have been that life and death have the same origin, and if an individual died, the fertility and the future life of the clan would be ensured.&lt;ref name="steins92"/&gt;

[[Viking funeral#Ibn Fadlan's account|Ibn Fadlan's eyewitness account of a Viking funeral]] describes a slave girl who was to be sacrificed and who had to undergo several sexual rites. When the chieftain had been put in the ship, she went from tent to tent where she visited warriors and traders. Every man told her that they did what they did for their love to the dead chieftain. Lastly, she entered a tent that had been raised on the ship, and in it six men had intercourse with her before she was strangled and stabbed.&lt;ref name="Harrison79"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:79&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual rites with the slave girl show that she was considered to be a vessel for the transmission of life force to the deceased chieftain.&lt;ref name="steins89"&gt;Steinsland &amp; Meulengracht Sørensen 1998:89&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elio de Angelis''' (26 March 1958 – 15 May 1986) was an Italian [[racing driver]] who participated in [[Formula One]] between {{F1|1979}} and {{F1|1986}}, racing for the [[Shadow Racing Cars|Shadow]], [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Brabham]] teams. He was killed in an accident while testing the [[Brabham BT55]] at the [[Circuit Paul Ricard|Paul Ricard circuit]], near the ''commune'' of [[Le Castellet, Var|Le Castellet]], France, in 1986. De Angelis was a very competitive and highly popular presence in Formula One during the 1980s, and is sometimes referred to as Formula One's "last gentleman player".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f1technical.net/news/2965|title=20 years since Elio de Angelis died|work=f1technical.net|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
De Angelis was born in [[Rome]]. His father Giulio was an inshore and offshore powerboat racer, who won many championships in the 1960s and 1970s.

After a brief spell with karts, de Angelis went on to win the [[Italian Formula Three Championship]] in 1977. In 1978 he raced in [[Formula Two]] for [[Minardi]] and then for the ICI British F2 Team, he also competed in one round of the [[1978 British Formula One season|British Formula One championship]] and won the prestigious [[Monaco Grand Prix Formula Three support race|Monaco F3 race]].

==Formula One==
At the end of the 1977 season, de Angelis was on [[Enzo Ferrari]]'s short list to replace [[Niki Lauda]]. De Angelis successfully tested the Ferrari at the [[Fiorano Circuit|Fiorano]] circuit but eventually Ferrari decided to hire [[Gilles Villeneuve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autosprint.corrieredellosport.it/news/formula1/2017/06/07-888458/ricordando_elio_de_angelis_il_terzo_memorial_scarfiotti_dedicato_a_lui/|title=Ricordando Elio De Angelis, il terzo Memorial Scarfiotti è dedicato a lui|website=corrieredellosport.it|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Angelis's debut Formula One season was in {{f1|1979}} with [[Shadow Racing Cars|Shadow]]. He finished seventh in his maiden Grand Prix in [[1979 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentina]] and 15th in the championship with three points.

De Angelis's performance with Shadow caught the eye of [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] boss [[Colin Chapman]], who hired him to partner [[Mario Andretti]] in {{f1|1980}}. At the age of 21, de Angelis nearly became the youngest Grand Prix winner of all time when he finished  second at the [[1980 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]], run at the  [[Autódromo José Carlos Pace|Interlagos]] circuit.
[[File:Elio De Angelis Silverstone.JPG|thumb|left|De Angelis driving for [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] at the [[1981 British Grand Prix]].]]
His first victory came in the [[1982 Austrian Grand Prix]] at the [[Österreichring]],  0.05 seconds ahead of the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] of eventual {{f1|1982}} World Champion [[Keke Rosberg]]. The win was the last hailed by [[Colin Chapman]]'s  act of throwing his cloth cap into the air. Chapman died in December that year and [[Peter Warr]] became the new Lotus team manager.

In {{f1|1983}} Lotus switched from the [[Cosworth DFV]] they had been using since {{f1|1967}}, to [[Renault F1|Renault]] turbo engines, but it was a disappointing season. De Angelis's best result was a fifth place in the [[1983 Italian Grand Prix]].

In {{f1|1984}} de Angelis had a much better season, scoring a total of 34 points and finishing third in the standings with three podiums. His best result was a second place at the [[1984 Detroit Grand Prix|Detroit Grand Prix]]. De Angelis was the only driver to finish in the top 5 in 1984 not to score a race win, showing his consistent performances throughout the season with the improving Lotus-Renault.

In {{f1|1985}}, de Angelis was joined at Lotus by [[Ayrton Senna]], who had left the [[Toleman]] team. De Angelis's second win came in the third race of the season, at the [[1985 San Marino Grand Prix]], after [[Alain Prost]] was disqualified when his [[McLaren MP4/2|McLaren MP4/2B]] was found 2&amp;nbsp;kg underweight. De Angelis also claimed his last Formula One pole position that year in [[1985 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]]. He finished fifth in the championship, with 33 points, five points behind his teammate. However, de Angelis chose to leave Lotus at the end of the season, frustrated that the team's efforts were being focused mostly on Senna.

De Angelis's drive for {{f1|1986}} was with [[Brabham]], as a replacement for twice World Champion [[Nelson Piquet]], who had moved to Williams to join de Angelis's former Lotus teammate [[Nigel Mansell]]. Fellow Italian [[Riccardo Patrese]] was his teammate. Patrese was returning to the [[Bernie Ecclestone]] owned team after two unhappy years with [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]].

The 1986 Brabham-BMW, the BT55, was the brainchild of long time Brabham designer [[Gordon Murray]]. The BT55 was a lowline car with a reduced frontal area, the idea being to have a cleaner airflow over the car to create more downforce, while at the same time reducing the car's drag. The chassis proved effective, unlike the [[Straight-4|l4]] [[BMW M12|BMW]] turbo that had to be tilted to an angle of 72°. This caused severe oil surge and an even greater lack of throttle response than the BMW had become famous for. Although the team worked hard to overcome these problems, it was clear from early in the season that Brabham had fallen behind the leading pack.

==Death and aftermath==
In that year, during tests at the Paul Ricard circuit in France, the rear wing of de Angelis's BT55 detached at high speed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eliodeangelis.info/elio_de_angelis_paul-ricard.php|title=Elio de Angelis – Paul Ricard Accident 14th May 1986|work=www.eliodeangelis.info|accessdate=30 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GlxjkYvz?url=http://www.eliodeangelis.info/elio_de_angelis_paul-ricard.php|archivedate=21 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the car losing downforce on the rear wheels, which instigated a cartwheel over a sidetrack barrier, causing the car to catch fire. The impact itself did not kill de Angelis but he was unable to extract himself from the car unassisted. The situation was exacerbated by the lack of track marshals on the circuit who could have provided him with emergency assistance. A 30-minute delay ensued before a helicopter arrived and de Angelis died 29 hours later, at the hospital in [[Marseille]] where he had been taken, from smoke inhalation. His actual crash impact injuries were only a broken [[collar bone]] and light burns on his back. 

De Angelis's death also saw the end of Formula One using the full 5.81&amp;nbsp;km (3.61&amp;nbsp;mi) Paul Ricard Circuit. F1 cars started using the 3.812&amp;nbsp;km (2.369&amp;nbsp;mi) "Club" version of the circuit, bypassing the Verriere curves where the Brabham had crashed, and cutting the length of the Mistral Straight from 1.8 to 1&amp;nbsp;km in length. The move was unpopular with many of the drivers, although most did like the reduced straight length as it was easier on the engines. Paul Ricard would not host a race on the full layout until {{F1|2018}}, which featured sharper Verriere curves and a chicane on Mistral effectively cutting the straight to two 800m straights.

De Angelis's place in the Brabham team was subsequently taken by [[Derek Warwick]], allegedly because Warwick was the only available top level driver who did not contact team owner Bernie Ecclestone immediately after de Angelis's death asking to replace him. [[McLaren]] driver [[Keke Rosberg]], who was a close friend of de Angelis, retired at the end of the 1986 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/ats/motorsport/driver/1042.html|title=Keke Rosberg|work=ESPN UK|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Angelis was the last driver to die in a Formula One car until [[Roland Ratzenberger]] died during qualifying for the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]] eight years later. The day after Ratzenberger's death, de Angelis's former Lotus teammate (and by then a triple World Champion) Ayrton Senna was killed on the seventh lap when his [[Williams FW16|Williams]]-Renault crashed into the Tamburello Curve wall at over {{Convert|180|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.

==Legacy==
De Angelis was a concert-standard pianist, and famously kept his fellow Formula One drivers entertained with his skills while they locked themselves in a [[Johannesburg]] hotel before the [[1982 South African Grand Prix]] at [[Kyalami]] when the [[Grand Prix Drivers Association]] held a strike in protest at the new [[superlicense]] conditions imposed by the governing body, [[FIA|FISA]].

The French-Italian driver [[Jean Alesi]], who broke into the sport in {{f1|1989}}, wore a helmet that matched de Angelis's design, in tribute to his semi-compatriot.

In 2016, in an academic paper that reported a mathematical modeling study that assessed the relative influence of driver and machine, de Angelis was ranked the 20th best Formula One driver of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Top 50 F1 drivers of all time, regardless of what they were driving |first=Mike |last=Hanlon |date=2016-05-12 |accessdate=2017-12-23 |url=https://newatlas.com/go/43147/ |work=New Atlas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 de Angelis was honoured at the [[Ludovico Scarfiotti]] Memorial in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cronachemaceratesi.it/2017/05/23/memorial-lodovico-scarfiotti-dedicato-a-elio-de-angelis-jean-alesi-sulla-sua-lotus/965645/|title=Memorial Lodovico Scarfiotti  dedicato a Elio De Angelis,  Jean Alesi sulla sua Lotus|date=23 May 2017|website=cronachemaceratesi.it|accessdate=4 January 2018}} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emily Wilding Davison.jpg|thumb|Emily Davison, {{circa}} 1910–1912]]

'''Emily Wilding Davison''' (11 October 1872&amp;nbsp;– 8 June 1913) was a [[suffragette]] who fought for [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|votes for women]] in Britain in the early twentieth century. A member of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) and a militant fighter for her cause, she was arrested on ten occasions, went on [[hunger strike]] seven times and was [[force fed]] on forty-nine occasions. She died after being hit by [[George V|King George V]]'s horse Anmer at the [[1913 Epsom Derby|1913 Derby]] when she walked onto the track during the race.

Davison grew up in a middle-class family, and studied at [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway College]], London, and [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]], before taking jobs as a teacher and governess. She joined the WSPU in November 1906 and became an officer of the organisation and a chief steward during marches. She soon became known in the organisation for her daring militant action; her tactics included breaking windows, throwing stones, setting fire to postboxes and, on three occasions, hiding overnight in the [[Palace of Westminster]]—including on the night of the 1911 census. Her funeral on 14 June 1913 was organised by the WSPU. A procession of 5,000 suffragettes and their supporters accompanied her coffin and 50,000 people lined the route through London; her coffin was then taken by train to the family plot in [[Morpeth, Northumberland]].

Davison was a [[Christian feminism|staunch feminist and passionate Christian]], and considered that [[socialism]] was a moral and political force for good. Much of her life has been interpreted through the manner of her death. She gave no prior explanation for what she planned to do at the Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been judged by history. Several theories have been put forward, including accident, suicide, or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
[[File:Emily Davison, 1908.jpg|thumb|upright|Davison in 1908]]
Emily Wilding Davison was born at Roxburgh House, Greenwich, in south-east London on 11 October 1872. Her parents were Charles Davison, a retired merchant, and Margaret, ''{{nee}}'' Caisley, both of [[Morpeth, Northumberland]].{{sfn|San Vito|2008}} At the time of his marriage to Margaret in 1868, Charles was 45 and Margaret was 19.{{sfn|Sleight|1988|pp=22–23}} Emily was the third of four children born to the couple; her younger sister died of [[diphtheria]] in 1880 at the age of six.{{sfn|Howes|2013|loc=410–422}}{{sfn|Sleight|1988|pp=22–24}}{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=156}} The marriage to Margaret was Charles's second; his first marriage produced nine children before the death of his wife in 1866.{{sfn|San Vito|2008}}

The family moved to [[Sawbridgeworth]], [[Hertfordshire]], while Davison was still a baby; until the age of 11 she was educated at home. When her parents moved the family back to London she went to a day school, then spent a year studying in [[Dunkirk]], France.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=5, 9}} When she was 13 she attended [[Kensington Preparatory School|Kensington High School]] and later won a [[bursary]] to [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway College]] in 1891 to study literature. Her father died in early 1893 and she was forced to end her studies because her mother could not afford the fees of £20 a term.{{sfn|Sleight|1988|pp=26–27}}{{efn|£20 in 1892 equates to approximately £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20|1892|r=-2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} pounds, according to calculations based on [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]] measure of inflation.{{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}}}}

On leaving Holloway, Davison became a live-in [[governess]], and continued studying in the evenings.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|p=15}} She saved enough money to enrol at [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]], for one term to sit her [[Final examination|finals]];{{efn|At the time of Davison's studies, Holloway was not a constituent school of the [[University of London]] and could not award degrees, so her studies were for the qualification of the Oxford Honour School.{{sfn|Abrams|2003|p=161}}}} she achieved [[first-class honours]] in English, but could not graduate because degrees from Oxford were closed to women.{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=159}} She worked briefly at a [[church school]] in [[Edgbaston]] between 1895 and 1896, but found it difficult and moved to Seabury, a [[private school]] in [[Worthing]], where she was more settled; she left the town in 1898 and became a private tutor and governess to a family in [[Northamptonshire]].{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=159}}{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=160}}{{sfn|Sleight|1988|pp=28–30}} In 1902 she began reading for a degree at the [[University of London]]; she graduated with [[third-class honours]] in 1908.{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=161}}{{efn|Sources differ over the subject of her degree. Some state that she studied modern languages,{{sfn|San Vito|2008}}{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=161}} others that she graduated in classics and mathematics.{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|p=464}}{{sfn|Purvis|2013a|p=354}}}}

===Activism===
Davison joined the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) in November 1906.{{sfn|Purvis|2013a|p=354}} Formed in 1903 by [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], the WSPU brought together those who thought that militant, confrontational tactics were needed to achieve their ultimate goal of women's suffrage.{{sfn|Naylor|2011|p=18}}{{efn|Such tactics included vandalism, [[arson]] and planting bombs.{{sfn|Webb|2014|pp=xiii–xiv, 60}}}} Davison joined in the WSPU's campaigning, and became an officer of the organisation and a chief steward during marches.{{sfn|Sleight|1988|p=32}} In 1908 or 1909 she left her job teaching and dedicated herself full-time to the union.{{sfn|San Vito|2008}} She began taking increasingly confrontational actions, which prompted [[Sylvia Pankhurst]]—the daughter of Emmeline and a full-time member of the WSPU—to describe her as "one of the most daring and reckless of the militants".{{sfn|Pankhurst|2013|loc=6363}}{{sfn|Naylor|2011|p=19}} In March 1909 she was arrested for the first time; she had been part of a deputation of 21 women who marched from [[Caxton Hall]] to see the prime minister, [[H. H. Asquith]],{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=160}} the march ended in a fracas with police, and she was arrested for "assaulting the police in the execution of their duty". She was sentenced to a month in prison.{{sfn|A. J. R.|1913|p=221}}{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=167}} After her release she wrote to ''Votes for Women'', the WSPU's newspaper, saying that "Through my humble work in this noblest of all causes I have come into a fullness of job and an interest in living which I never before experienced."{{sfn|Davison, ''Votes for Women'', 1909}}

[[File:Forcefeeding.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A woman in prison is tied to a chair while four members of staff force feed her|A suffragette being force-fed in [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway prison]], {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;1911]]
In July 1909 Davison was arrested with fellow suffragettes [[Mary Leigh]] and [[Alice Paul]] for interrupting a public meeting from which women were barred, held by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[David Lloyd George]]; she was sentenced to two months for obstruction. She went on [[Hunger strike#British and American suffragettes|hunger strike]] and was released after five and a half days,{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=160}}{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=21–22}} during which time she lost {{convert|21|lb|kg}}; she stated that she "felt very weak" as a result.{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|p=465}} She was arrested again in September the same year for throwing stones to break windows at a political meeting; the assembly, which was to protest at the [[People's Budget|1909 budget]], was only open to men. She was sent to [[Strangeways prison]] for two months. She again went on hunger strike and was released after two and a half days.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|p=24}} She subsequently wrote to ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' to justify her action of throwing stones as one "which was meant as a warning to the general public of the personal risk they run in future if they go to Cabinet Ministers' meetings anywhere". She went on to write that this was justified because of the "unconstitutional action of Cabinet Ministers in addressing 'public meetings' from which a large section of the public is excluded".{{sfn|Davison, ''The Manchester Guardian'', 1909}}{{sfn|Bearman|2007|p=878}}

Davison was arrested again in early October 1909, while preparing to throw a stone at the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet minister]] [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Sir Walter Runciman]]; she acted in the mistaken belief the car in which he travelled contained Lloyd George. A suffragette colleague—[[Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton|Constance Lytton]]—threw hers first, before the police managed to intervene. Davison was charged with attempted assault, but released; Lytton was imprisoned for a month.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=24–25}} Davison used her court appearances to give speeches; excerpts and quotes from these were published in the newspapers.{{sfn|Stanley|1995|p=236}} Two weeks later she threw stones at Runciman at a political meeting in [[Radcliffe, Greater Manchester]]; she was arrested and sentenced to a week's [[hard labour]]. She again went on hunger strike, but the government had authorised the use of [[Force-feeding#United Kingdom|force-feeding]] on prisoners.{{sfn|A. J. R.|1913|p=221}}{{sfn|Purvis|2013a|p=355}} The historian Gay Gullickson describes the tactic as "extremely painful, psychologically harrowing, and raised the possibility of dying in jail from medical error or official misjudgment".{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|p=465}} Davison said that the experience "will haunt me with its horror all my life, and is almost indescribable.&amp;nbsp;... The torture was barbaric".{{sfn|Collette|2013|p=133}} Following the first episode of forced feeding, and to prevent a repeat of the experience, Davison barricaded herself in her cell using her bed and a stool and refused to allow the prison authorities to enter. They broke one of the window panes to the cell and turned a fire hose on her for 15 minutes, while attempting to force the door open. By the time the door was opened, the cell was six inches deep in water. She was taken to the prison hospital where she was warmed by hot water bottles. She was force-fed shortly afterwards and released after eight days.{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|pp=468–469}}{{sfn|Collette|2013|pp=133–135}} Davison's treatment prompted the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP [[Keir Hardie]] to ask a question in the House of Commons about the "assault committed on a woman prisoner in Strangeways";{{sfn|Hardie, 1909}} Davison sued the prison authorities for the use of the hose and, in January 1910, she was awarded 40 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] in damages.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=32–33}}

In April 1910 Davison decided to gain entry to the floor of the House of Commons to ask Asquith about the vote for women. She entered the [[Palace of Westminster]] with other members of the public and made her way into the heating system, where she hid overnight. On a trip from her hiding place to find water, she was arrested by a policeman, but not prosecuted.{{sfn|Sleight|1988|pp=42–43}}{{sfn|"Emily Wilding Davison found hiding in a ventilation shaft"}} The same month she became an employee of the WSPU and began to write for ''Votes for Women''.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=36–37}}{{sfn|Purvis|2013a|p=356}}{{efn|Although some sources, including Colmore and Purvis, state that Davison was employed in the Information Department of the union, the journalist [[Fran Abrams]] writes that Davison was never a salaried member of WSPU staff, but she was paid for the articles she provided for ''Votes for Women''.{{sfn|Abrams|2003|p=167}}}}

A bipartisan group of MPs formed a Conciliation Committee in early 1910 and proposed a [[Conciliation Bill]] that would have brought the vote to a million women, so long as they owned property. While the bill was being discussed, the WSPU put in a temporary truce on activity. The bill failed that November when Asquith's [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government reneged on a promise to allow parliamentary time to debate the bill.{{sfn|Foot|2005|pp=210–211}} A WSPU delegation of around 300 women tried to present him with a petition, but were prevented from doing so by an aggressive police response; the suffragettes, who called the day [[Black Friday (1910)|Black Friday]], complained of assault, much of which was sexual in nature.{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|p=470}}{{sfn|Purvis|2002|p=150}} Davison was not one of the 122 people arrested, but was incensed by the treatment of the delegation; the following day she broke several windows in the [[Clerk of the Crown in Chancery|Crown Office]] in parliament. She was arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. She went on hunger strike again and was force-fed for eight days before being released.{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=161}}{{efn|Despite the loss of the Conciliation Bill, the WSPU maintained the truce until May 1911 when a second Conciliation Bill, having passed its Second Reading, was dropped by the government for internal political reasons. The WSPU saw this as a betrayal and resumed their militant activities.{{sfn|Foot|2005|pp=211–212}}}}

On the night of the 1911 census, 2 April, Davison hid in a cupboard in [[St Mary Undercroft]], the chapel of the Palace of Westminster. She remained hidden overnight to avoid being entered onto the census; the attempt was part of a wider suffragette action to avoid being listed by the state. She was found by a cleaner, who reported her presence; Davison was arrested but not charged. The Clerk of Works at the House of Commons completed a census form to include Davison in the returns. She was included in the census twice, as her landlady also included her as being present at her lodgings.{{sfn|Liddington|Crawford|Maund|2011|pp=108, 124}}{{sfn|"A Night in Guy Fawkes Cupboard", ''Votes For Women'', 1911}}{{efn|Davison also spent a night in the Palace of Westminster in June 1911.{{sfn|A. J. R.|1913|p=221}}}} Davison had continually written letters to the press to put forward the WSPU position in a non-violent manner—she had 12 published in ''The Manchester Guardian'' between 1909 and 1911—and she undertook a campaign between 1911 and 1913 during which she wrote nearly 200 letters to over 50 newspapers.{{sfn|Collette|2013|p=173}}{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=183}} Several of her letters were published, including about 26 in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' between September 1910 and 1912.{{sfn|Crawford|2014|pp=1006–1007}}

[[File:Emily Davison, c. 1912-13.jpg|thumb|upright|Davison in 1912 or 1913]]
Davison developed the new tactic of setting fire to postboxes in December 1911. She was arrested for arson on the postbox outside parliament and admitted to setting fire to two others. Sentenced to six months in [[Holloway Prison]], she did not go on hunger strike at first, but the authorities required that she be force-fed between 29 February and 7 March 1912 because they considered her health and appetite to be in decline. In June she and other suffragette inmates barricaded themselves in their cells and went on hunger strike; the authorities broke down the cell doors and force-fed the strikers.{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=43–44}} Following the force-feeding, Davison decided on what she described as a "desperate protest&amp;nbsp;... made to put a stop to the hideous torture, which was now our lot" and jumped from one of the interior balconies of the prison.{{sfn|Davison|1913|p=577}} She later wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;as soon as I got out I climbed on to the railing and threw myself out to the wire-netting, a distance of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, on to the iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, as it was a clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught on the edge of the netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.{{sfn|Davison|1913|p=577}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She cracked two [[vertebrae]] and badly injured her head. Shortly afterwards, and despite her injuries, she was again force-fed before being released ten days early.{{sfn|A. J. R.|1913|p=221}}{{sfn|Cawthorne|2017}} She wrote to ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'' to explain why she "attempted to commit suicide":

&lt;blockquote&gt;I did it deliberately and with all my power, because I felt that by nothing but the sacrifice of human life would the nation be brought to realise the horrible torture our women face! If I had succeeded I am sure that forcible feeding could not in all conscience have been resorted to again.{{sfn|Davison|1912|p=4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a result of her action Davison suffered discomfort for the rest of her life.{{sfn|Naylor|2011|p=19}} Her arson of postboxes was not authorised by the WSPU leadership and this, together with her other actions, led to her falling out of favour with the organisation; Sylvia Pankhurst later wrote that the WSPU leadership wanted "to discourage&amp;nbsp;... [Davison] in such tendencies&amp;nbsp;... She was condemned and ostracized as a self-willed person who persisted in acting upon her own initiative without waiting for official instructions."{{sfn|Pankhurst|2013|loc=9029}} A statement Davison wrote on her release from prison for ''The Suffragette''—the second official newspaper of the WSPU—was published by the union after her death.{{sfn|San Vito|2008}}{{sfn|Morley|Stanley|1988|p=74}}

In November 1912 Davison was arrested for a final time, for attacking a [[Baptist]] minister with a horsewhip; she had mistaken the man for Lloyd George. She was sentenced to ten days' imprisonment and released early following a four-day hunger strike.{{sfn|A. J. R.|1913|p=221}}{{sfn|Purvis|2013a|p=357}} It was the seventh time she had been on hunger strike, and the forty-ninth time she had been force-fed.{{sfn|West|1982|p=179}}

===Fatal injury at the Derby===

The events involving Davison occur between 5:51 and 6:15.]]
On 4 June 1913 Davison obtained two flags bearing the [[Suffragette#Colours|suffragette colours]] of purple, white and green from the WSPU offices; she then travelled by train to [[Epsom]], Surrey, to attend the [[Epsom Derby|Derby]].{{sfn|Colmore|1988|pp=56–57}} She positioned herself at Tattenham Corner, the final bend before the [[home straight]]. At this point in the race, with some of the horses having passed her, she ducked under the guard rail and ran onto the course; she may have held in her hands one of the suffragette flags. She reached up to the reins of Anmer—[[George V|King George V]]'s horse, ridden by [[Herbert Jones (jockey)|Herbert Jones]]—and was hit by the animal, which would have been travelling at around {{convert|35|mi|km}} per hour,{{sfn|Purvis|2013b}}{{sfn|Tanner|2013|pp=214–215}} four seconds after stepping onto the course.{{sfn|''Secrets of a Suffragette'', 26 May 2013|loc=Event occurs at 35:10–36:06}} Anmer fell in the collision and partly rolled over his jockey, who had his foot momentarily caught in the stirrup.{{sfn|Purvis|2013b}}{{sfn|Tanner|2013|pp=214–215}}  Davison was knocked to the ground unconscious; some reports say she was kicked in the head by Anmer, but the surgeon who operated on Davison stated that "I could find no trace of her having been kicked by a horse".{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=278}} The event was captured on three news cameras.{{sfn|''Secrets of a Suffragette'', 26 May 2013|loc=Event occurs at 2:10–2:15}}{{efn|Craganour, the [[Bookmaker (gambling)|bookmakers']] favourite, crossed the finishing line first, but a stewards' enquiry led to the horse being placed last and the race being awarded to [[Aboyeur]], a [[Fixed-odds betting#Fractional odds|100/1]] outsider.{{sfn|Tanner|2013|pp=224, 243–244}}}}

Bystanders rushed onto the track and attempted to aid Davison and Jones until both were taken to the nearby [[Epsom Cottage Hospital]]. She was operated on two days later, but she never regained consciousness; while in hospital she received hate mail.{{sfn|Morley|Stanley|1988|p=103}}{{sfn|Tanner|2013|pp=284–285}}{{efn|One letter, signed "An Englishman", read "I am glad that you are in hospital.

The King later recorded in his diary that it was "a most regrettable and scandalous proceeding"; in her journal the Queen described Davison as a "horrid woman".{{sfn|Tanner|2013|pp=281–282}} Jones suffered a concussion and other injuries; he spent the evening of 4 June in London, before returning home the following day.{{sfn|Tanner|2013|pp=276–277}} He could recall little of the event: "She seemed to clutch at my horse, and I felt it strike her."{{sfn|"Suffragette and the King's Horse", ''The Manchester Guardian''}} He recovered sufficiently to race Anmer at [[Ascot Racecourse]] two weeks later.{{sfn|Greer|2013}}

The inquest into Davison's death took place at Epsom on 10 June; Jones was not well enough to attend.{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=287}} Davison's half-brother, Captain Henry Davison, gave evidence about his sister, saying that she was "a woman of very strong reasoning faculties, and passionately devoted to the women's movement".{{sfn|"The Suffragist Outrage at the Derby", ''The Times''}} The coroner decided that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, Davison had not committed suicide.{{sfn|"Miss Davison's Death", ''The Manchester Guardian''}} The coroner also decided that, although she had waited until she could see the horses, "from the evidence it was clear that the woman did not make for His Majesty's horse in particular".{{sfn|"Miss Davison's Death", ''The Manchester Guardian''}} The verdict of the court was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;that Miss Emily Wilding Davison died of fracture of the base of the skull, caused by being accidentally knocked down by a horse through wilfully rushing on to the racecourse on Epsom Downs during the progress of the race for the Derby; death was due to misadventure.{{sfn|"The Suffragist Outrage at the Derby", ''The Times''}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Davison's purpose in attending the Derby and walking onto the course is unclear. She did not discuss her plans with anyone or leave a note.{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|p=473}}{{sfn|Brown|2013}} Several theories have been suggested, including that she intended to cross the track, believing that all horses had passed; that she wanted to pull down the King's horse; that she was trying to attach one of the WSPU flags to a horse; or that she intended to throw herself in front of one of the horses.{{sfn|Thorpe|2013}} The historian Elizabeth Crawford considers that "subsequent explanations of&amp;nbsp;... [Davison's] action have created a tangle of fictions, false deductions, hearsay, conjecture, misrepresentation and theory".{{sfn|Crawford|2014|p=1000}}

In 2013 a [[Channel 4]] documentary used forensic examiners who digitised the original [[nitrate film]] from the three cameras present. The film was digitally cleaned and examined. Their examination suggests that Davison intended to throw a suffragette flag around the neck of a horse or attach it to the horse's [[bridle]].{{efn|[[Carolyn Collette]], a literary critic who has studied Davison's writing, observes that there have long been stories of Davison practising at grabbing bridles of horses, but these are all unconfirmed.{{sfn|Collette|2013|p=21}}}} A flag was gathered from the course; this was put up for auction and, as at 2017, it hangs in the Houses of Parliament.{{sfn|Thorpe|2013}} Michael Tanner, the horse-racing historian and author of a history of the 1913 Derby, doubts the authenticity of the item. [[Sotheby's]], the auction house who sold it, describe it as a sash that was "reputed" to have been worn by Davison. The seller stated that her father, Richard Pittway Burton, was the Clerk of the Course at Epsom; Tanner's search of records shows Burton was listed as a dock labourer two weeks prior to the Derby. The official Clerk of the Course on the day of the Derby was Henry Mayson Dorling.{{sfn|Tanner|2013|pp=344–345}} When the police listed Davison's possessions, they itemised the two flags provided by the WSPU, both folded up and pinned to the inside of her jacket. They measured 44.5 by 27 inches (113 x 69&amp;nbsp;cm); the sash displayed at the Houses of Parliament measures 82 by 12 inches (210 x 30&amp;nbsp;cm).{{sfn|Tanner|2013|pp=278–279}}

Tanner considers that Davison's choice of the King's horse was "pure happenstance", as her position on the corner would have left her with a limited view.{{sfn|Tanner|2013|pp=289–290}} Examination of the newsreels by the forensic team employed by the Channel 4 documentary determined that Davison was closer to the start of the bend than had been previously assumed, and would have had a better view of the oncoming horses.{{sfn|''Secrets of a Suffragette'', 26 May 2013|loc=Event occurs at 35:10–36:06}}{{sfn|Thorpe|2013}}

The contemporary news media were largely unsympathetic to Davison,{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=282}} and many publications "questioned her sanity and characterised her actions as suicidal".{{sfn|Gullickson|2016|p=10}} ''The Pall Mall Gazette'' said it had "pity for the dementia which led an unfortunate woman to seek a grotesque and meaningless kind of 'martyrdom'&amp;thinsp;",{{sfn|"The Distracting Derby", ''The Pall Mall Gazette''}} while ''[[The Daily Express]]'' described Davison as "A well-known malignant suffragette, &amp;nbsp;... [who] has a long record of convictions for complicity in suffragette outrages."{{sfn|"The Derby of Disasters", ''Daily Express''}} The journalist for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' observed that "Deep in the hearts of every onlooker was a feeling of fierce resentment with the miserable woman";{{sfn|Tanner|2013|p=282}} the unnamed writer in ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' opined that "It was quite evident that her condition was serious; otherwise many of the crowd would have fulfilled their evident desire to lynch her."{{sfn|"Woman's Mad Attack on the King's Derby Horse", ''The Daily Mirror''}}

The WSPU were quick to describe her as a martyr, part of a campaign to identify her as such.{{sfn|Purvis|2013a|p=358}}{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|p=462}} ''The Suffragette'' newspaper marked Davison's death by issuing a copy showing a female angel with raised arms standing in front of the guard rail of a racecourse.{{sfn|"In Honour and Loving Memory of Emily Wilding Davison", ''The Suffragette''}} The paper's editorial stated that "Davison has proved that there are in the twentieth century people who are willing to lay down their lives for an ideal".{{sfn|"The Supreme Sacrifice", ''The Suffragette''}} Religious phraseology was used in the issue to describe her act, including "Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends", which Gullickson reports as being repeated several times in subsequent discussions of the events.{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|p=474}} A year after the Derby, ''The Suffragette'' included "The Price of Liberty", an essay by Davison. In it, she had written "To lay down life for friends, that is glorious, selfless, inspiring! But to re-enact the tragedy of Calvary for generations yet unborn, that is the last consummate sacrifice of the Militant".{{sfn|Davison|1914|p=129}}

===Funeral===
[[File:Britain Before the First World War Q81834.jpg|thumb|alt=A procession of Suffragettes, dressed in white and bearing wreaths and a banner reading "Fight on and God will give the victory" during the funeral procession of Emily Davison in Morpeth, Northumberland, 13 June 1913. Crowds line the street to watch.|Part of Davison's funeral procession in Morpeth, Northumberland]]
On 14 June 1913 Davison's body was transported from Epsom to London; her coffin was inscribed "Fight on. God will give the victory."{{sfn|"The Funeral of Miss Davison", ''The Times''}} Five thousand women formed a procession, followed by hundreds of male supporters, that took the body between [[London Victoria station|Victoria]] and [[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]] stations; the procession stopped at [[St George's, Bloomsbury]] for a brief service.{{sfn|"Miss Davison's Funeral", ''The Manchester Guardian''}} The women marched in ranks wearing the suffragette colours of white and purple, which ''The Manchester Guardian'' described as having "something of the deliberate brilliance of a military funeral";{{sfn|"Miss Davison's Funeral", ''The Manchester Guardian''}} 50,000 people lined the route, and [[June Purvis]], Davison's biographer, describes the event as "the last of the great suffragette spectacles".{{sfn|Purvis|2013a|p=358}}{{sfn|Sleight|1988|p=84}} Emmeline Pankhurst planned to be part of the procession, but she was arrested on the morning, ostensibly to be returned to prison under the [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|"Cat and Mouse" Act (1913)]].{{sfn|"The Suffragist Outrage at the Derby", ''The Times''}}{{sfn|"Miss Davison's Funeral", ''The Manchester Guardian''}}{{efn|The Cat and Mouse Act—officially the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913—was introduced by the Liberal government to counter the suffragette tactic of hunger strikes. The act allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health, then to be re-arrested when they had recovered to finish their prison sentences.{{sfn|"1913 Cat and Mouse Act"}}}}

The coffin was taken by train to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] with a suffragette guard of honour for the journey; crowds met the train at its scheduled stops. The coffin remained overnight at the city's [[Newcastle railway station|central station]] before being taken to Morpeth. A procession of about a hundred suffragettes accompanied the coffin from the station to the St. Mary the Virgin church; it was watched by thousands. Only a few of the suffragettes entered the churchyard, as the service and interment were private.{{sfn|"Miss Davison's Funeral", ''The Manchester Guardian''}}{{sfn|"Miss Davison's Funeral", ''Votes for Women''}} Her gravestone bears the WSPU slogan "Deeds not words".{{sfn|Sleight|1988|p=100}}

==Approach and analysis==
[[File:Emily Davison in later life.jpg|thumb|upright|Davison towards the end of her life, showing the effects of hunger strikes and force feeding{{sfn|Tanner|2013|loc=facing p. 172}}]]
Davison's death marked a culmination and a turning point of the militant suffragette campaign. The [[First World War]] broke out the following year and, on 10 August 1914, the government released all women hunger strikers and declared an amnesty. Emmeline Pankhurst suspended WSPU operations on 13 August.{{sfn|Purvis|1995|p=98}}{{sfn|Collette|2013|p=31}} Pankhurst subsequently assisted the government in the recruitment of women for war work.{{sfn|Pugh|1974|p=360}}{{sfn|"Archives – The Suffragettes"}}  In 1918 Parliament passed the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]]. Among the changes was the granting of the vote to women over the age of 30 who could pass property qualifications.{{efn|To be able to vote women had to be householders or the wives of householders, or pay more than £5 a year in rent, or be a graduate of a British university. Practically all the property qualifications for men were abolished by the act.{{sfn|Purvis|1995|p=98}}}} The legislation added 8.5 million women to the electoral roll; they constituted 43% of the electorate.{{sfn|Purvis|1995|pp=98–99}}{{sfn|"Representation of the People Act 1918"}} In 1928 the [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928|Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act]] lowered the voting age for women to 21 to put them on equal terms with male voters.{{sfn|"Equal Franchise Act 1928"}}{{sfn|Purvis|1995|p=99}}

Crawford sees the events at the 1913 Derby as a lens "through which&amp;nbsp;... [Davison's] whole life has been interpreted",{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=159}} and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions that day has affected how she has been judged by history.{{sfn|Gullickson|2008|p=462}}{{sfn|Collette|2008|pp=223–224}} [[Carolyn Collette]], a literary critic who has studied Davison's writing, identifies the different motives ascribed to Davison, including "uncontrolled impulses" or a search for martyrdom for women's suffrage. Collette also sees a more current trend among historians "to accept what some of her close contemporaries believed: that Davison's actions that day were deliberate" and that she attempted to attach the suffragette colours to the King's horse.{{sfn|Collette|2008|pp=223–224}} [[Cicely Hale]], a suffragette who worked at the WSPU and who knew Davison, described her as "a fanatic" who was prepared to die but did not mean to.{{sfn|Crawford|2003|p=163}} Other observers, such as Purvis, and Ann Morley and Liz Stanley—Davison's biographers—agree that Davison did not mean to die.{{sfn|Purvis|2013a|p=359}}{{sfn|Morley|Stanley|1988|p=65}}

Davison was a [[Christian feminism|staunch feminist and a passionate Christian]]{{sfn|Gullickson|2016|p=15}}{{sfn|Purvis|2013a|p=360}} whose outlook "invoked both medieval history and faith in God as part of the armor of her militancy".{{sfn|Collette|2012|p=170}} Her love of English literature, which she had studied at Oxford, was shown in her identification with [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Knight's Tale]]'', including being nicknamed "Faire Emelye".{{sfn|Colmore|1988|p=11}}{{sfn|Collette|2008|p=226}} Much of Davison's writing reflected the doctrine of the Christian faith and referred to martyrs, martyrdom and triumphant suffering; according to Collette, the use of Christian and medieval language and imagery "directly reflects the politics and rhetoric of the militant suffrage movement". Purvis writes that Davison's committed Anglicanism would have stopped her from committing suicide because it would have meant that she could not be buried in [[consecrated ground]].{{sfn|Collette|2012|p=170}}{{sfn|Purvis|2013c|p=49}} Davison wrote in "The Price of Liberty" about the high cost of devotion to the cause:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the New Testament, the Master reminded His followers that when the merchant had found the Pearl of Great Price, he sold all that he had in order to buy it. That is the parable of Militancy! It is that which the women warriors are doing to-day.&lt;br&gt;
Some are truer warriors than others, but the perfect Amazon is she who will sacrifice all even unto the last, to win the Pearl of Freedom for her sex.{{sfn|Davison|1914|p=129}}{{sfn|Collette|2012|p=172}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Davison held a firm moral conviction that [[socialism]] was a moral and political force for good.{{sfn|Morley|Stanley|1988|pp=169–170}} She attended the annual [[May Day]] rallies in Hyde Park and, according to the historian Krista Cowman, "directly linked her militant suffrage activities with socialism".{{sfn|Cowman|2002|p=142}} Her London and Morpeth funeral processions contained a heavy socialist presence in appreciation of her support for the cause.{{sfn|Cowman|2002|p=142}}

==Legacy==
[[File:Emily Davison plaque at Epsom Downs Racecourse.jpg|thumb|alt=Plaque dedicated to Davison. In addition to her name and dates, the text reads "It was from this place, on the 4th June 1913, that suffragette Emily Wilding Davison sustained injuries that resulted in her death at Epsom Cottage Hospital. Her lifelong dedication to women's suffrage and the contribution she made to the lives of British women past and present, is remembered.|Plaque to Davison at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse]]]]
In 1968 a one-act play written by Joice Worters, ''Emily'', was staged in [[Northumberland]], focusing on the use of violence against the women's campaign.{{sfn|Sleight|1988|p=102}} Davison is the subject of an opera, ''Emily'' (2013), by the British composer [[Tim Benjamin]], and of "Emily Davison", a song by the American rock singer [[Greg Kihn]].{{sfn|Hall|2015|p=4}} Davison also appears as a supporting character in the 2015 film ''[[Suffragette (film)|Suffragette]]'', in which she is portrayed by [[Natalie Press]]. Her death and funeral form the climax of the film.{{sfn|Blair|2016}} In January 2018 the [[cantata]] ''Pearl of Freedom'', telling the story of Davison's suffragette struggles, was premiered. The music was by the composer Joanna Marsh; the [[librettist]] was [[David Pountney]].{{sfn|Marsh|2018}}

In 1990 the Labour MPs [[Tony Benn]] and [[Jeremy Corbyn]] placed a commemorative plaque inside the cupboard in which Davison had hidden eighty years earlier.{{sfn|Benn|2014|pp=xiii–xiv}}{{sfn|"Benn's Secret Tribute to Suffragette Martyr", BBC}} In April 2013 a plaque was unveiled at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse|Epsom racecourse]] to mark the centenary of her death.{{sfn|Barnett|2013}} In January 2017 [[Royal Holloway, University of London]] announced that its new library would be named after her.{{sfn|"Emblem of women's emancipation", Royal Holloway, University of London}} The [[statue of Millicent Fawcett]] in [[Parliament Square]], London, unveiled in April 2018, features Davison's name and picture, along with those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters, on the [[plinth]] of the statue.{{sfn|"Mayor Marks Centenary of Women's Suffrage", Mayor of London}} The [[Women's Library]], at the [[London School of Economics]], holds several collections related to Davison.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4147">The '''European Center for Studies and Research in Ethics''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethique.unistra.fr/en/welcome-to-ceere/?no_cache=1/|title=CEERE}}&lt;/ref&gt;is a tertiary establishment for divers forms of research and studies in [[Ethics]]. This center is located at the premises of the old faculty of medicine at [[Strasbourg]], [[France]]. The '''CEERE''' (Centre européen d’enseignement et de recherche en éthique) as it is called in French, collaborates with multiple university and higher education institutions both in France and from other countries in its pursuit of world class innovative research and academics in the domain of Ethics.

== Postgraduate studies in Ethics (Master’s degrees and Doctoral degrees) ==
The CEERE affords students the opportunity to undertake studies for the award of [[List of masters programs in bioethics|master]]’s and [[List of doctoral programs in bioethics|doctoral]] degrees in Ethics from the University of Strasbourg. The Masters program can be undertaken in any of five specialities such as [[Medical Ethics]] and [[Bioethics]], Ethics and Religions, Ethics and [[Management]], [[Human Rights]]: Principles, Norms and Interpretation, as well as in Ethics and Society. This Masters program also had a bilingual program in English and French. The 2014 [[summer school]] in Ethics organized by CEERE and her partners was considered a huge success, drawing students from many countries around the world.
The CEERE team is composed of eminent professors and scholars from a wide range of disciplines underlining the pluridisciplinary nature of research that goes on in CEERE.

== Award for quality research == 
In June 2008, the CEERE was awarded the first prize in France for the teaching of Ethics. This price is one of the many recognitions the center has since received for its service to the academic community in France and worldwide with regard to research in Ethics.

== The CEERE Alumni ==
There exists an [[alumni]] association for former students of CEERE who collaborate on divers research projects including helping new students discover the rich world of research and studies in Ethics. This association was formed in 2013.

== The international symposia in Ethics ==
The CEERE has organized five international symposia in Ethics in Strasbourg, France, since its inception in 2008. 
* The first of its kind was held from Thursday March 30, 2006, through Saturday April 1, 2006. This premier edition was focused on the theme “Dying rites” (Les Rites autour de mourir).
* The second edition was held from Thursday the 29 of March through Saturday March 31, 2007. This second edition centered on the subject of “Giving and Receiving Organs, Right, Due, and Responsibility, (in French: Donner, recevoir un organe. Droit, Dû, Devoir.)
* The third international symposium in Ethics took place from Wednesday March 25 through Saturday March 28, 2009, on the theme: When Nascent life Ends (in French: Quand la vie naissante se termine). 
* The fourth international symposium in Ethics held from Wednesday March 23, through Saturday, March 26, 2011. The theme of this fourth edition was “The autumn of Life: The Ethical Challenges of Aging” (in French: L'Automne de la vie: Éthiques du vieillissement. 
* The fifth international symposium &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethique-jie.unistra.fr/index.php?id=13085&amp;no_cache=1|title=The international symposia in Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt;in Ethics took place from Wednesday April 10, through Saturday April 13, 2013. The theme of this fifth edition was “The Ethical challenges of disability (in French: Les enjeux éthiques du handicap).

The '''FBI Victims Identification Project''' (also known as VICTIMS) is an active research project within the [[FBI Laboratory]] to create a national database containing all available records of [[unidentified decedent|unidentified human remains]]. The goal of VICTIMS 
is to create a federally sponsored national database of unidentified remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.fbi.gov/hq/lab/html/victims.htm|title=Federal Bureau of Investigation - Laboratory Services|website=www2.fbi.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there are many groups attempting to bring closure to an estimated 40,000 unidentified human remains cases nationwide, but VICTIMS is the first attempt to produce a comprehensive approach to the problem.

== Current status ==
Currently in the data gathering stage, VICTIMS will contain a variety of forms of information that may assist in the identification of unidentified human remains. This information includes case data, biological data, photographs, facial reconstructions, [[Anthropology|anthropological]] data, [[Radiography|radiographs]] and dental charts. The project is requesting United States agencies with unidentified human remains to contact them to enter their cases into the database.

== Project team ==
The VICTIMS project team consists the FBI Laboratory personnel, personnel from the FBI Visiting Scientist Program administered by Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education and the prime contractor Guiding Beacon Solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidingbeacon.com Guiding Beacon Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt; Guiding Beacon, a management and technology consulting firm from Pennsylvania, is providing the technology and data collection efforts for the project.

In [[computer science]] and [[operations research]], a '''genetic algorithm''' ('''GA''') is a [[metaheuristic]] inspired by the process of [[natural selection]] that belongs to the larger class of [[evolutionary algorithm]]s (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[Search algorithm|search problem]]s by relying on bio-inspired operators such as [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]], [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] and [[selection (genetic algorithm)|selection]].{{sfn|Mitchell|1996|p=2}} John Holland introduced '''Genetic Algorithm''' ('''GA''') in 1960 based on the concept of '''Darwin’s theory of evolution'''; afterwards, his student Goldberg extended GA in 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-07-10|title=Optimizing a hybrid vendor-managed inventory and transportation problem with fuzzy demand: An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025514001819|journal=Information Sciences|language=en|volume=272|pages=126–144|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2014.02.075|issn=0020-0255}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Methodology ==

=== Optimization problems ===
'''Genetic Algorithm''' has  been  used  extensively  "as  a  powerful  tool  to  solve  various  optimization  problems such as integer  nonlinear  problems  (INLP)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadeghi|first=Javad|last2=Niaki|first2=Seyed Taghi Akhavan|last3=Malekian|first3=Mohammad Reza|last4=Sadeghi|first4=Saeid|date=2016|title=Optimising multi-item economic production quantity model with trapezoidal fuzzy demand and backordering: two tuned meta-heuristics|url=https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/EJIE.2016.075847|journal=European J. of Industrial Engineering|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=170|doi=10.1504/ejie.2016.075847|issn=1751-5254}}&lt;/ref&gt;. "GA is one of the meta-heuristics that has been frequently utilized to find near-optimum solutions of many combinational problems" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-07-10|title=Optimizing a hybrid vendor-managed inventory and transportation problem with fuzzy demand: An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025514001819|journal=Information Sciences|language=en|volume=272|pages=126–144|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2014.02.075|issn=0020-0255}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In a genetic algorithm, a [[population]] of [[candidate solution]]s (called individuals, creatures, or [[phenotype]]s) to an optimization problem is evolved toward better solutions. Each candidate solution has a set of properties (its [[chromosome]]s or [[genotype]]) which can be mutated and altered; traditionally, solutions are represented in binary as strings of 0s and 1s, but other encodings are also possible.{{sfn|Whitley|1994|p=66}}

The evolution usually starts from a population of randomly generated individuals, and is an [[Iteration|iterative process]], with the population in each iteration called a ''generation''. In each generation, the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of every individual in the population is evaluated; the fitness is usually the value of the [[objective function]] in the optimization problem being solved. The more fit individuals are [[Stochastics|stochastically]] selected from the current population, and each individual's genome is modified ([[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|recombined]] and possibly randomly mutated) to form a new generation. The new generation of candidate solutions is then used in the next iteration of the [[algorithm]]. Commonly, the algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations has been produced, or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population.

A typical genetic algorithm requires:

# a [[genetic representation]] of the solution domain,
# a [[fitness function]] to evaluate the solution domain.

A standard representation of each candidate solution is as an [[bit array|array of bits]].{{sfn|Whitley|1994|p=66}} Arrays of other types and structures can be used in essentially the same way. The main property that makes these genetic representations convenient is that their parts are easily aligned due to their fixed size, which facilitates simple [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] operations. Variable length representations may also be used, but crossover implementation is more complex in this case. Tree-like representations are explored in [[genetic programming]] and graph-form representations are explored in [[evolutionary programming]]; a mix of both linear chromosomes and trees is explored in [[gene expression programming]].

Once the genetic representation and the fitness function are defined, a GA proceeds to initialize a population of solutions and then to improve it through repetitive application of the mutation, crossover, inversion and selection operators.

==== Initialization ====
The population size depends on the nature of the problem, but typically contains several hundreds or thousands of possible solutions. Often, the initial population is generated randomly, allowing the entire range of possible solutions (the [[Feasible region|search space]]). Occasionally, the solutions may be "seeded" in areas where optimal solutions are likely to be found.

==== Selection ====
{{Main article|Selection (genetic algorithm)}}
During each successive generation, a portion of the existing population is [[selection (genetic algorithm)|selected]] to breed a new generation. Individual solutions are selected through a ''fitness-based'' process, where [[Fitness (biology)|fitter]] solutions (as measured by a [[fitness function]]) are typically more likely to be selected. Certain selection methods rate the fitness of each solution and preferentially select the best solutions. Other methods rate only a random sample of the population, as the former process may be very time-consuming.

The fitness function is defined over the genetic representation and measures the ''quality'' of the represented solution. The fitness function is always problem dependent. For instance, in the [[knapsack problem]] one wants to maximize the total value of objects that can be put in a knapsack of some fixed capacity. A representation of a solution might be an array of bits, where each bit represents a different object, and the value of the bit (0 or 1) represents whether or not the object is in the knapsack. Not every such representation is valid, as the size of objects may exceed the capacity of the knapsack. The ''fitness'' of the solution is the sum of values of all objects in the knapsack if the representation is valid, or 0 otherwise.

In some problems, it is hard or even impossible to define the fitness expression; in these cases, a [[Computer simulation|simulation]] may be used to determine the fitness function value of a [[phenotype]] (e.g. [[computational fluid dynamics]] is used to determine the air resistance of a vehicle whose shape is encoded as the phenotype), or even [[Interactive evolutionary computation|interactive genetic algorithms]] are used.

==== Genetic operators ====
{{Main article|Crossover (genetic algorithm)|Mutation (genetic algorithm)}}

The next step is to generate a second generation population of solutions from those selected through a combination of [[genetic operator]]s: [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] (also called recombination), and [[mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]].

For each new solution to be produced, a pair of "parent" solutions is selected for breeding from the pool selected previously. By producing a "child" solution using the above methods of crossover and mutation, a new solution is created which typically shares many of the characteristics of its "parents". New parents are selected for each new child, and the process continues until a new population of solutions of appropriate size is generated.
Although reproduction methods that are based on the use of two parents are more "biology inspired", some research&lt;ref&gt;Eiben, A. E. et al (1994). "Genetic algorithms with multi-parent recombination". PPSN III: Proceedings of the International Conference on Evolutionary Computation. The Third Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature: 78&amp;ndash;87. {{ISBN|3-540-58484-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ting, Chuan-Kang (2005). "On the Mean Convergence Time of Multi-parent Genetic Algorithms Without Selection". Advances in Artificial Life: 403&amp;ndash;412. {{ISBN|978-3-540-28848-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that more than two "parents" generate higher quality chromosomes.

These processes ultimately result in the next generation population of chromosomes that is different from the initial generation. Generally the average fitness will have increased by this procedure for the population, since only the best organisms from the first generation are selected for breeding, along with a small proportion of less fit solutions. These less fit solutions ensure genetic diversity within the genetic pool of the parents and therefore ensure the genetic diversity of the subsequent generation of children.

Opinion is divided over the importance of crossover versus mutation. There are many references in [[David B. Fogel|Fogel]] (2006) that support the importance of mutation-based search.

Although crossover and mutation are known as the main genetic operators, it is possible to use other operators such as regrouping, colonization-extinction, or migration in genetic algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;Akbari, Ziarati (2010). "A multilevel evolutionary algorithm for optimizing numerical functions" IJIEC 2 (2011): 419&amp;ndash;430  [http://growingscience.com/ijiec/Vol2/IJIEC_2010_11.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth tuning parameters such as the [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]] probability, [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] probability and population size to find reasonable settings for the problem class being worked on. A very small mutation rate may lead to [[genetic drift]]  (which is non-[[Ergodicity|ergodic]] in nature). A recombination rate that is too high may lead to premature convergence of the genetic algorithm. A mutation rate that is too high may lead to loss of good solutions, unless [[#Elitism|elitist selection]] is employed.

==== Heuristics ====

In addition to the main operators above, other heuristics may be employed to make the calculation faster or more robust. The ''speciation'' heuristic penalizes crossover between candidate solutions that are too similar; this encourages population diversity and helps prevent premature convergence to a less optimal solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a525/1192091cc6c138cf8010e43d72b9dfb0d022.pdf|title=Handbook of Evolutionary Computation|last=Deb|first=Kalyanmoy|last2=Spears|first2=William M.|publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=C6.2: Speciation methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-540-92910-9_32|title=Handbook of Natural Computing|last=Shir|first=Ofer M.|date=2012|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|year=|isbn=9783540929093|editor-last=Rozenberg|editor-first=Grzegorz|location=|pages=1035–1069|language=en|chapter=Niching in Evolutionary Algorithms|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-92910-9_32|editor-last2=Bäck|editor-first2=Thomas|editor-last3=Kok|editor-first3=Joost N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Termination ====
This generational process is repeated until a termination condition has been reached. Common terminating conditions are:

* A solution is found that satisfies minimum criteria
* Fixed number of generations reached
* Allocated budget (computation time/money) reached
* The highest ranking solution's fitness is reaching or has reached a plateau such that successive iterations no longer produce better results
* Manual inspection
* Combinations of the above

Genetic algorithms are simple to implement, but their behavior is difficult to understand. In particular it is difficult to understand why these algorithms frequently succeed at generating solutions of high fitness when applied to practical problems. The building block hypothesis (BBH) consists of:

# A description of a heuristic that performs adaptation by identifying and recombining "building blocks", i.e. low order, low defining-length [[Schema (genetic algorithms)|schemata]] with above average fitness.
# A hypothesis that a genetic algorithm performs adaptation by implicitly and efficiently implementing this heuristic.

Goldberg describes the heuristic as follows:

:"Short, low order, and highly fit schemata are sampled, [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|recombined]] [crossed over], and resampled to form strings of potentially higher fitness. In a way, by working with these particular schemata [the building blocks], we have reduced the complexity of our problem; instead of building high-performance strings by trying every conceivable combination, we construct better and better strings from the best partial solutions of past samplings.

:"Because highly fit schemata of low defining length and low order play such an important role in the action of genetic algorithms, we have already given them a special name: building blocks. Just as a child creates magnificent fortresses through the arrangement of simple blocks of wood, so does a genetic algorithm seek near optimal performance through the juxtaposition of short, low-order, high-performance schemata, or building blocks."{{sfn|Goldberg|1989|p=41}}

Despite the lack of consensus regarding the validity of the building-block hypothesis, it has been consistently evaluated and used as reference throughout the years. Many [[estimation of distribution algorithm]]s, for example, have been proposed in an attempt to provide an environment in which the hypothesis would hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harik|first1=Georges R.|last2=Lobo|first2=Fernando G.|last3=Sastry|first3=Kumara|title=Linkage Learning via Probabilistic Modeling in the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm (ECGA)|journal=Scalable Optimization via Probabilistic Modeling|date=1 January 2006|pages=39–61|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-34954-9_3|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-34954-9_3|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pelikan|first1=Martin|last2=Goldberg|first2=David E.|last3=Cantú-Paz|first3=Erick|title=BOA: The Bayesian Optimization Algorithm|journal=Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation - Volume 1|date=1 January 1999|pages=525–532|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2933973|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although good results have been reported for some classes of problems, skepticism concerning the generality and/or practicality of the building-block hypothesis as an explanation for GAs efficiency still remains.

== Limitations ==
There are limitations of the use of a genetic algorithm compared to alternative optimization algorithms:

* Repeated [[fitness function]] evaluation for complex problems is often the most prohibitive and limiting segment of artificial evolutionary algorithms. Finding the optimal solution to complex high-dimensional, multimodal problems often requires very expensive [[fitness function]] evaluations. In real world problems such as structural optimization problems, a single function evaluation may require several hours to several days of complete simulation. Typical optimization methods can not deal with such types of problem. In this case, it may be necessary to forgo an exact evaluation and use an [[fitness approximation|approximated fitness]] that is computationally efficient. It is apparent that amalgamation of [[fitness approximation|approximate models]] may be one of the most promising approaches to convincingly use GA to solve complex real life problems.
* Genetic algorithms do not scale well with complexity. That is, where the number of elements which are exposed to mutation is large there is often an exponential increase in search space size. This makes it extremely difficult to use the technique on problems such as designing an engine, a house or plane. In order to make such problems tractable to evolutionary search, they must be broken down into the simplest representation possible. Hence we typically see evolutionary algorithms encoding designs for fan blades instead of engines, building shapes instead of detailed construction plans, and airfoils instead of whole aircraft designs. The second problem of complexity is the issue of how to protect parts that have evolved to represent good solutions from further destructive mutation, particularly when their fitness assessment requires them to combine well with other parts.
* The "better" solution is only in comparison to other solutions. As a result, the stop criterion is not clear in every problem.
* In many problems, GAs have a tendency to converge towards [[local optimum|local optima]] or even arbitrary points rather than the [[global optimum]] of the problem. This means that it does not "know how" to sacrifice short-term fitness to gain longer-term fitness. The likelihood of this occurring depends on the shape of the [[fitness landscape]]: certain problems may provide an easy ascent towards a global optimum, others may make it easier for the function to find the local optima. This problem may be alleviated by using a different fitness function, increasing the rate of mutation, or by using selection techniques that maintain a diverse population of solutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taherdangkoo|first=Mohammad|last2=Paziresh |first2=Mahsa |last3=Yazdi |first3=Mehran |last4= Bagheri |first4=Mohammad Hadi |title=An efficient algorithm for function optimization: modified stem cells algorithm|journal=Central European Journal of Engineering|date=19 November 2012|volume=3|issue=1|pages=36–50|doi=10.2478/s13531-012-0047-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[No free lunch in search and optimization|No Free Lunch theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert, D.H., Macready, W.G., 1995. No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimisation. Santa Fe Institute, SFI-TR-05-010, Santa Fe.&lt;/ref&gt; proves that there is no general solution to this problem. A common technique to maintain diversity is to impose a "niche penalty", wherein, any group of individuals of sufficient similarity (niche radius) have a penalty added, which will reduce the representation of that group in subsequent generations, permitting other (less similar) individuals to be maintained in the population. This trick, however, may not be effective, depending on the landscape of the problem. Another possible technique would be to simply replace part of the population with randomly generated individuals, when most of the population is too similar to each other. Diversity is important in genetic algorithms (and [[genetic programming]]) because crossing over a homogeneous population does not yield new solutions. In [[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]] and [[evolutionary programming]], diversity is not essential because of a greater reliance on mutation.
* Operating on dynamic data sets is difficult, as genomes begin to converge early on towards solutions which may no longer be valid for later data. Several methods have been proposed to remedy this by increasing genetic diversity somehow and preventing early convergence, either by increasing the probability of mutation when the solution quality drops (called ''triggered hypermutation''), or by occasionally introducing entirely new, randomly generated elements into the gene pool (called ''random immigrants''). Again, [[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]] and [[evolutionary programming]] can be implemented with a so-called "comma strategy" in which parents are not maintained and new parents are selected only from offspring. This can be more effective on dynamic problems.
* GAs cannot effectively solve problems in which the only fitness measure is a single right/wrong measure (like [[decision problem]]s), as there is no way to converge on the solution (no hill to climb). In these cases, a random search may find a solution as quickly as a GA. However, if the situation allows the success/failure trial to be repeated giving (possibly) different results, then the ratio of successes to failures provides a suitable fitness measure.
* For specific optimization problems and problem instances, other optimization algorithms may be more efficient than genetic algorithms in terms of speed of convergence. Alternative and complementary algorithms include [[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]], [[evolutionary programming]], [[simulated annealing]], [[Gaussian adaptation]], [[hill climbing]], and [[swarm intelligence]] (e.g.: [[ant colony optimization]], [[particle swarm optimization]]) and methods based on [[integer linear programming]]. The suitability of genetic algorithms is dependent on the amount of knowledge of the problem; well known problems often have better, more specialized approaches.

== Variants ==

=== Chromosome representation ===
{{main article | genetic representation }}
The simplest algorithm represents each chromosome as a [[Bit array|bit string]]. Typically, numeric parameters can be represented by [[integer]]s, though it is possible to use [[floating point]] representations. The floating point representation is natural to [[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]] and [[evolutionary programming]]. The notion of real-valued genetic algorithms has been offered but is really a misnomer because it does not really represent the building block theory that was proposed by [[John Henry Holland]] in the 1970s. This theory is not without support though, based on theoretical and experimental results (see below). The basic algorithm performs crossover and mutation at the bit level. Other variants treat the chromosome as a list of numbers which are indexes into an instruction table, nodes in a [[linked list]], [[associative array|hashes]], [[object (computer science)|objects]], or any other imaginable [[data structure]]. Crossover and mutation are performed so as to respect data element boundaries. For most data types, specific variation operators can be designed. Different chromosomal data types seem to work better or worse for different specific problem domains.

When bit-string representations of integers are used, [[Gray coding]] is often employed. In this way, small changes in the integer can be readily affected through mutations or crossovers. This has been found to help prevent premature convergence at so called ''Hamming walls'', in which too many simultaneous mutations (or crossover events) must occur in order to change the chromosome to a better solution.

Other approaches involve using arrays of real-valued numbers instead of bit strings to represent chromosomes. Results from the theory of schemata suggest that in general the smaller the alphabet, the better the performance, but it was initially surprising to researchers that good results were obtained from using real-valued chromosomes. This was explained as the set of real values in a finite population of chromosomes as forming a ''virtual alphabet'' (when selection and recombination are dominant) with a much lower cardinality than would be expected from a floating point representation.&lt;ref name=Goldberg1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=David E.|title=The theory of virtual alphabets|journal=Parallel Problem Solving from Nature, Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=1991|volume=496|pages=13–22|doi=10.1007/BFb0029726|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0029726|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Janikow1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janikow|first=C. Z.|first2=Z. |last2=Michalewicz |title=An Experimental Comparison of Binary and Floating Point Representations in Genetic Algorithms|journal=Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Genetic Algorithms|year=1991|pages=31–36|url=http://www.cs.umsl.edu/~janikow/publications/1991/GAbin/text.pdf|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An expansion of the Genetic Algorithm accessible problem domain can be obtained through more complex encoding of the solution pools by concatenating several types of heterogenously encoded genes into one chromosome.&lt;ref name=Patrascu2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patrascu|first=M.|last2=Stancu|first2=A.F.|last3=Pop|first3=F.|title=HELGA: a heterogeneous encoding lifelike genetic algorithm for population evolution modeling and simulation|journal=Soft Computing|year=2014|volume=18|pages=2565–2576|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-014-1401-y|doi=10.1007/s00500-014-1401-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular approach allows for solving optimization problems that require vastly disparate definition domains for the problem parameters. For instance, in problems of cascaded controller tuning, the internal loop controller structure can belong to a conventional regulator of three parameters, whereas the external loop could implement a linguistic controller (such as a fuzzy system) which has an inherently different description. This particular form of encoding requires a specialized crossover mechanism that recombines the chromosome by section, and it is a useful tool for the modelling and simulation of complex adaptive systems, especially evolution processes.

=== Elitism ===
A practical variant of the general process of constructing a new population is to allow the best organism(s) from the current generation to carry over to the next, unaltered. This strategy is known as ''elitist selection'' and guarantees that the solution quality obtained by the GA will not decrease from one generation to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Baluja |first1=Shumeet |first2=Rich |last2=Caruana |title=Removing the genetics from the standard genetic algorithm |conference=[[International Conference on Machine Learning|ICML]] |year=1995 |url=http://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub2/baluja_shumeet_1995_1/baluja_shumeet_1995_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parallel implementations ===
Parallel implementations of genetic algorithms come in two flavors. Coarse-grained parallel genetic algorithms assume a population on each of the computer nodes and migration of individuals among the nodes. Fine-grained parallel genetic algorithms assume an individual on each processor node which acts with neighboring individuals for selection and reproduction.
Other variants, like genetic algorithms for [[online optimization]] problems, introduce time-dependence or noise in the fitness function.

=== Adaptive GAs ===
Genetic algorithms with adaptive parameters (adaptive genetic algorithms, AGAs) is another significant and promising variant of genetic algorithms. The probabilities of crossover (pc) and mutation (pm) greatly determine the degree of solution accuracy and the convergence speed that genetic algorithms can obtain. Instead of using fixed values of ''pc'' and ''pm'', AGAs utilize the population information in each generation and adaptively adjust the ''pc'' and ''pm'' in order to maintain the population diversity as well as to sustain the convergence capacity. In AGA (adaptive genetic algorithm),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Srinivas |first=M. |last2=Patnaik |first2=L. |title=Adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation in genetic algorithms |journal=IEEE Transactions on System, Man and Cybernetics |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=656–667 |year=1994 |doi=10.1109/21.286385 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the adjustment of ''pc'' and ''pm'' depends on the fitness values of the solutions. In ''CAGA'' (clustering-based adaptive genetic algorithm),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhang |first=J. |last2=Chung |first2=H. |last3=Lo, W. L. |title=Clustering-Based Adaptive Crossover and Mutation Probabilities for Genetic Algorithms |journal=IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=326&amp;ndash;335 |year=2007 |doi=10.1109/TEVC.2006.880727 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through the use of clustering analysis to judge the optimization states of the population, the adjustment of ''pc'' and ''pm'' depends on these optimization states.
It can be quite effective to combine GA with other optimization methods. GA tends to be quite good at finding generally good global solutions, but quite inefficient at finding the last few mutations to find the absolute optimum. Other techniques (such as simple hill climbing) are quite efficient at finding absolute optimum in a limited region. Alternating GA and hill climbing can improve the efficiency of GA {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} while overcoming the lack of robustness of hill climbing.

This means that the rules of genetic variation may have a different meaning in the natural case. For instance &amp;ndash; provided that steps are stored in consecutive order &amp;ndash; crossing over may sum a number of steps from maternal DNA adding a number of steps from paternal DNA and so on. This is like adding vectors that more probably may follow a ridge in the phenotypic landscape. Thus, the efficiency of the process may be increased by many orders of magnitude. Moreover, the [[Chromosomal inversion|inversion operator]] has the opportunity to place steps in consecutive order or any other suitable order in favour of survival or efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance [http://www.thisurlisfalse.com/evolution-in-a-nutshell/ Evolution-in-a-nutshell] or example in [[travelling salesman problem]], in particular the use of an [[edge recombination operator]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation, where the population as a whole is evolved rather than its individual members, is known as gene pool recombination.

A number of variations have been developed to attempt to improve performance of GAs on problems with a high degree of fitness epistasis, i.e. where the fitness of a solution consists of interacting subsets of its variables. Such algorithms aim to learn (before exploiting) these beneficial phenotypic interactions. As such, they are aligned with the Building Block Hypothesis in adaptively reducing disruptive recombination. Prominent examples of this approach include the mGA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.complex-systems.com/issues/03-5.html |first=D.

== Problem domains ==
Problems which appear to be particularly appropriate for solution by genetic algorithms include [[Timeline|timetabling]] and scheduling problems, and many scheduling software packages are based on GAs{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}. GAs have also been applied to [[engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomoiagă B, Chindriş M, Sumper A, Sudria-Andreu A, Villafafila-Robles R.

As a general rule of thumb genetic algorithms might be useful in problem domains that have a complex [[fitness landscape]] as mixing, i.e., [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]] in combination with [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]], is designed to move the population away from [[local optima]] that a traditional [[hill climbing]] algorithm might get stuck in. Observe that commonly used crossover operators cannot change any uniform population. Mutation alone can provide ergodicity of the overall genetic algorithm process (seen as a [[Markov chain]]).

Examples of problems solved by genetic algorithms include: mirrors designed to funnel sunlight to a solar collector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Bill|title=A solar energy system that tracks the sun|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gross_on_new_energy.html|work=TED|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; antennae designed to pick up radio signals in space,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=G.

In his ''Algorithm Design Manual'', [[Steven Skiena|Skiena]] advises against genetic algorithms for any task:

{{blockquote|[I]t is quite unnatural to model applications in terms of genetic operators like mutation and crossover on bit strings. The pseudobiology adds another level of complexity between you and your problem. Second, genetic algorithms take a very long time on nontrivial problems. [...] [T]he analogy with evolution—where significant progress require [sic] millions of years—can be quite appropriate.
[...]
I have never encountered any problem where genetic algorithms seemed to me the right way to attack it. Further, I have never seen any computational results reported using genetic algorithms that have favorably impressed me.

== History ==
In 1950, [[Alan Turing]] proposed a "learning machine" which would parallel the principles of evolution.&lt;ref name="mind.oxfordjournals.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turing|first1=Alan M.|title=Computing machinery and intelligence|journal=Mind|volume=LIX|issue=238|pages=433–460|doi=10.1093/mind/LIX.236.433|url=http://mind.oxfordjournals.org/content/LIX/236/433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer simulation of evolution started as early as in 1954 with the work of [[Nils Aall Barricelli]], who was using the computer at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Barricelli 1954 45–68"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barricelli|first=Nils Aall|year=1954|authorlink=Nils Aall Barricelli|title=Esempi numerici di processi di evoluzione|journal=Methodos|pages=45–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barricelli 1957 143–182"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barricelli|first=Nils Aall|year=1957|authorlink=Nils Aall Barricelli|title=Symbiogenetic evolution processes realized by artificial methods|journal=Methodos|pages=143–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His 1954 publication was not widely noticed. Starting in 1957,&lt;ref name="Fraser 1957 484–491"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Alex|authorlink=Alex Fraser (scientist)|year=1957|title=Simulation of genetic systems by automatic digital computers.

From these beginnings, computer simulation of evolution by biologists became more common in the early 1960s, and the methods were described in books by Fraser and Burnell (1970)&lt;ref name="Fraser 1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fraser|first=Alex|authorlink=Alex Fraser (scientist)|first2=Donald |last2=Burnell|year=1970|title=Computer Models in Genetics|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0-07-021904-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Crosby (1973).&lt;ref name="Crosby 1973"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crosby|first=Jack L.|year=1973|title=Computer Simulation in Genetics|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=London|isbn=0-471-18880-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser's simulations included all of the essential elements of modern genetic algorithms. In addition, [[Hans-Joachim Bremermann]] published a series of papers in the 1960s that also adopted a population of solution to optimization problems, undergoing recombination, mutation, and selection. Bremermann's research also included the elements of modern genetic algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/96legacy/releases.96/14319.html 02.27.96 - UC Berkeley's Hans Bremermann, professor emeritus and pioneer in mathematical biology, has died at 69&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other noteworthy early pioneers include Richard Friedberg, George Friedman, and Michael Conrad.

Fogel]], which was proposed for generating artificial intelligence. [[Evolutionary programming]] originally used finite state machines for predicting environments, and used variation and selection to optimize the predictive logics. Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the work of [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]] in the early 1970s, and particularly his book ''Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems'' (1975). His work originated with studies of [[cellular automata]], conducted by [[John Henry Holland|Holland]] and his students at the [[University of Michigan]]. Holland introduced a formalized framework for predicting the quality of the next generation, known as [[Holland's Schema Theorem]]. Research in GAs remained largely theoretical until the mid-1980s, when The First International Conference on Genetic Algorithms was held in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].

In the late 1980s, General Electric started selling the world's first genetic algorithm product, a mainframe-based toolkit designed for industrial processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MszVdu_PAMC&amp;dq=general+electric+genetic+algorithm+mainframe&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=An Approach to Designing an Unmanned Helicopter Autopilot Using Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing|last=Aldawoodi|first=Namir|publisher=ProQuest|year=2008|isbn=0549773495|location=|pages=99|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evolutionary algorithms====
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}
{{main article|Evolutionary algorithm}}
Evolutionary algorithms is a sub-field of [[Evolutionary Computation|evolutionary computing]].

* [[Evolution strategy|Evolution strategies]] (ES, see Rechenberg, 1994) evolve individuals by means of mutation and intermediate or discrete recombination. ES algorithms are designed particularly to solve problems in the real-value domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohoon|first=J et al.|title=Evolutionary algorithms for the physical design of VLSI circuits|url= https://www.ifte.de/mitarbeiter/lienig/cohoon.pdf|journal=Advances in Evolutionary Computing: Theory and Applications|publisher= Springer, pp. 683-712, 2003|isbn=978-3-540-43330-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They use self-adaptation to adjust control parameters of the search. De-randomization of self-adaptation has led to the contemporary Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy ([[CMA-ES]]).
* [[Evolutionary programming]] (EP) involves populations of solutions with primarily mutation and selection and arbitrary representations. They use self-adaptation to adjust parameters, and can include other variation operations such as combining information from multiple parents.
* [[Estimation of Distribution Algorithm]] (EDA) substitutes traditional reproduction operators by model-guided operators. Such models are learned from the population by employing machine learning techniques and represented as Probabilistic Graphical Models, from which new solutions can be sampled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pelikan|first1=Martin|last2=Goldberg|first2=David E.|last3=Cantú-Paz|first3=Erick|title=BOA: The Bayesian Optimization Algorithm|journal=Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation - Volume 1|date=1 January 1999|pages=525–532|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2933973|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pelikan|first1=Martin|title=Hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm : toward a new generation of evolutionary algorithms|date=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin [u.a.]|isbn=978-3-540-23774-7|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; or generated from guided-crossover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thierens|first1=Dirk|title=The Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm|journal=Parallel Problem Solving from Nature, PPSN XI|date=11 September 2010|pages=264–273|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-15844-5_27|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-15844-5_27|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gene expression programming]] (GEP) also uses populations of computer programs. These complex computer programs are encoded in simpler linear chromosomes of fixed length, which are afterwards expressed as expression trees. Expression trees or computer programs evolve because the chromosomes undergo mutation and recombination in a manner similar to the canonical GA. But thanks to the special organization of GEP chromosomes, these genetic modifications always result in valid computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferreira|first=C|title=Gene Expression Programming: A New Adaptive Algorithm for Solving Problems|url= http://www.gene-expression-programming.com/webpapers/GEP.pdf|publisher= Complex Systems, Vol. 13, issue 2: 87-129.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Genetic programming]] (GP) is a related technique popularized by [[John Koza]] in which computer programs, rather than function parameters, are optimized. Genetic programming often uses [[Tree (data structure)|tree-based]] internal [[data structure]]s to represent the computer programs for adaptation instead of the [[List (computing)|list]] structures typical of genetic algorithms.
* [[Grouping genetic algorithm]] (GGA) is an evolution of the GA where the focus is shifted from individual items, like in classical GAs, to groups or subset of items.&lt;ref name="Falkenauer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Falkenauer|first=Emanuel|authorlink=Emanuel Falkenauer|year=1997|title=Genetic Algorithms and Grouping Problems|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|location=Chichester, England|isbn=978-0-471-97150-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind this GA evolution proposed by [[Emanuel Falkenauer]] is that solving some complex problems, a.k.a. ''clustering'' or ''partitioning'' problems where a set of items must be split into disjoint group of items in an optimal way, would better be achieved by making characteristics of the groups of items equivalent to genes. These kind of problems include [[bin packing problem|bin packing]], line balancing, [[cluster analysis|clustering]] with respect to a distance measure, equal piles, etc., on which classic GAs proved to perform poorly. Making genes equivalent to groups implies chromosomes that are in general of variable length, and special genetic operators that manipulate whole groups of items. For bin packing in particular, a GGA hybridized with the Dominance Criterion of Martello and Toth, is arguably the best technique to date.
* [[Interactive evolutionary algorithm]]s are evolutionary algorithms that use human evaluation. They are usually applied to domains where it is hard to design a computational fitness function, for example, evolving images, music, artistic designs and forms to fit users' aesthetic preference.

====Swarm intelligence====
{{main article|Swarm intelligence}}
Swarm intelligence is a sub-field of [[Evolutionary Computation|evolutionary computing]].

* [[Ant colony optimization]] ('''ACO''') uses many ants (or agents) equipped with a pheromone model to traverse the solution space and find locally productive areas. Although considered an [[Estimation of distribution algorithm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zlochin|first1=Mark|last2=Birattari|first2=Mauro|last3=Meuleau|first3=Nicolas|last4=Dorigo|first4=Marco|title=Model-Based Search for Combinatorial Optimization: A Critical Survey|journal=Annals of Operations Research|date=1 October 2004|volume=131|issue=1-4|pages=373–395|doi=10.1023/B:ANOR.0000039526.52305.af|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:ANOR.0000039526.52305.af|language=en|issn=0254-5330}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Particle swarm optimization]] (PSO) is a computational method for multi-parameter optimization which also uses population-based approach. A population (swarm) of candidate solutions (particles) moves in the search space, and the movement of the particles is influenced both by their own best known position and swarm's global best known position. Like genetic algorithms, the PSO method depends on information sharing among population members. In some problems the PSO is often more computationally efficient than the GAs, especially in unconstrained problems with continuous variables.&lt;ref&gt;Rania Hassan, Babak Cohanim, Olivier de Weck, Gerhard Vente
r (2005) [http://www.mit.edu/~deweck/PDF_archive/3%20Refereed%20Conference/3_50_AIAA-2005-1897.pdf A comparison of particle swarm optimization and the genetic algorithm]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other evolutionary computing algorithms====

Evolutionary computation is a sub-field of the [[metaheuristic]] methods.

* [[Memetic algorithm]] (MA), often called ''hybrid genetic algorithm'' among others, is a population-based method in which solutions are also subject to local improvement phases. The idea of memetic algorithms comes from [[meme]]s, which unlike genes, can adapt themselves. In some problem areas they are shown to be more efficient than traditional evolutionary algorithms.
* [[Bacteriologic algorithm]]s (BA) inspired by [[evolutionary ecology]] and, more particularly, bacteriologic adaptation. Evolutionary ecology is the study of living organisms in the context of their environment, with the aim of discovering how they adapt. Its basic concept is that in a heterogeneous environment, there is not one individual that fits the whole environment. So, one needs to reason at the population level. It is also believed BAs could be successfully applied to complex positioning problems (antennas for cell phones, urban planning, and so on) or data mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/publis/2005/Baudry05d.pdf|format=PDF|first=Benoit|last=Baudry |author2=Franck Fleurey |author3=[[Jean-Marc Jézéquel]] |author4=Yves Le Traon|title=Automatic Test Case Optimization: A Bacteriologic Algorithm|date=March–April 2005|pages=76–82|journal=IEEE Software|issue=2|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|doi=10.1109/MS.2005.30|volume=22|accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cultural algorithm]] (CA) consists of the population component almost identical to that of the genetic algorithm and, in addition, a knowledge component called the belief space.
* [[Differential search algorithm]] (DS) inspired by migration of superorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Civicioglu|first=P.|title=Transforming Geocentric Cartesian Coordinates to Geodetic Coordinates by Using Differential Search Algorithm|journal=Computers &amp;Geosciences|year=2012|volume=46|pages=229–247|doi=10.1016/j.cageo.2011.12.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gaussian adaptation]] (normal or natural adaptation, abbreviated NA to avoid confusion with GA) is intended for the maximisation of manufacturing yield of signal processing systems. It may also be used for ordinary parametric optimisation. It relies on a certain theorem valid for all regions of acceptability and all Gaussian distributions. The efficiency of NA relies on information theory and a certain theorem of efficiency. Its efficiency is defined as information divided by the work needed to get the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kjellström|first=G.|title= On the Efficiency of Gaussian Adaptation|journal=Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications|volume=71|issue=3|pages=589–597|date=December 1991|doi= 10.1007/BF00941405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because NA maximises mean fitness rather than the fitness of the individual, the landscape is smoothed such that valleys between peaks may disappear. Therefore it has a certain "ambition" to avoid local peaks in the fitness landscape. NA is also good at climbing sharp crests by adaptation of the moment matrix, because NA may maximise the disorder ([[average information]]) of the Gaussian simultaneously keeping the [[mean fitness]] constant.

====Other metaheuristic methods====

Metaheuristic methods broadly fall within [[Stochastic optimization|stochastic]] optimisation methods.

* [[Simulated annealing]] (SA) is a related global optimization technique that traverses the search space by testing random mutations on an individual solution. A mutation that increases fitness is always accepted. A mutation that lowers fitness is accepted probabilistically based on the difference in fitness and a decreasing temperature parameter. In SA parlance, one speaks of seeking the lowest energy instead of the maximum fitness. SA can also be used within a standard GA algorithm by starting with a relatively high rate of mutation and decreasing it over time along a given schedule.
* [[Tabu search]] (TS) is similar to simulated annealing in that both traverse the solution space by testing mutations of an individual solution. While simulated annealing generates only one mutated solution, tabu search generates many mutated solutions and moves to the solution with the lowest energy of those generated. In order to prevent cycling and encourage greater movement through the solution space, a tabu list is maintained of partial or complete solutions. It is forbidden to move to a solution that contains elements of the tabu list, which is updated as the solution traverses the solution space.
* [[Extremal optimization]] (EO) Unlike GAs, which work with a population of candidate solutions, EO evolves a single solution and makes [[local search (optimization)|local]] modifications to the worst components. This requires that a suitable representation be selected which permits individual solution components to be assigned a quality measure ("fitness"). The governing principle behind this algorithm is that of ''emergent'' improvement through selectively removing low-quality components and replacing them with a randomly selected component. This is decidedly at odds with a GA that selects good solutions in an attempt to make better solutions.

====Other stochastic optimisation methods====

* The [[Cross-entropy method|cross-entropy (CE) method]] generates candidates solutions via a parameterized probability distribution. The parameters are updated via cross-entropy minimization, so as to generate better samples in the next iteration.
* Reactive search optimization (RSO) advocates the integration of sub-symbolic machine learning techniques into search heuristics for solving complex optimization problems. The word reactive hints at a ready response to events during the search through an internal online feedback loop for the self-tuning of critical parameters. Methodologies of interest for Reactive Search include machine learning and statistics, in particular [[reinforcement learning]], [[Active learning (machine learning)|active or query learning]], [[neural networks]], and [[metaheuristics]].

'''George Jones Adams''' (ca. 1811 – May 11, 1880) was the leader of a schismatic [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint]] sect who led an ill-fated effort to establish a colony of [[United States|Americans]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Adams was also briefly a member of the [[First Presidency]] in the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]].  In preparation for colonizing Palestine, he changed his name to '''George Washington Joshua Adams''', to tie himself to two well-known country builders: [[George Washington]] of the United States and [[Joshua]]  of [[ancient Israel]].

==Conversion and early church service==
Adams was born in [[Oxford, New Jersey]] of Welsh descent. By the 1830s, he had been trained as a [[Methodism|Methodist]] preacher and was a merchant tailor. He was also an aspiring [[Shakespeare]]an actor, but had little success in being cast in roles.

While travelling from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] to New York City in February 1840, Adams heard the preaching of Latter Day Saint [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Heber C. Kimball]], and was [[Baptism|baptized]] into the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] the same week. Within a month he had become an [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elder]] in the church. In 1841, Adams traveled to England as a [[missionary]] for the church; he was successful in winning numerous converts and stayed in England for eighteen months.

In October 1843, [[President of the Church|church president]] [[Joseph Smith]] asked Adams to travel with apostle [[Orson Hyde]] as a missionary to Russia. In 1844, Smith invited Adams to join the exclusive [[Council of Fifty]]. On June 7, 1844, Smith [[Setting apart|set apart]] Adams "to be an apostle and special witness ... to the empire of Russia", in preparation for the Mormon political kingdom.&lt;ref name = DMQ&gt;[[D. Michael Quinn]] (1994). ''The Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books) p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt; However, just prior to Adams' planned departure later that month, all church political efforts were suspended after Smith was [[Death of Joseph Smith|killed]] and the church was thrown into [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|turmoil]]. Adams returned to New England as a regular missionary, and, along with [[William Smith (Latter Day Saints)|William Smith]], Joseph Smith's surviving brother,&lt;ref name = DMQ/&gt; created much turmoil among the [[Branch (Latter Day Saint movement)|branches]] there, claiming to be the "Thirteenth Apostle" and "greater than Paul," and therefore having more authority than any of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.  On April 10, 1845, Adams was excommunicated by the [[Quorum of Twelve Apostles]] for proposing that the church be led by [[Joseph Smith III]] (Joseph Smith's eldest son) under the guardianship of [[William Smith (Latter Day Saints)|William Smith]].&lt;ref name = DMQ/&gt;

Back in [[Boston]] in 1847, Adams was the main witness in the trial of ''Cobb v. Cobb'', in which Henry Cobb sued his wife, Augusta Adams Cobb, for divorce, for having committed [[adultery]] with Joseph Smith's successor, [[Brigham Young]]; she had married Young in November 1843 without first divorcing Henry.  The court case went to the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], presided over by Chief Justice [[Lemuel Shaw]], and was widely reported in newspapers nationwide.

==Strangite leader==
After his excommunication, Adams came to accept the spiritual leadership of [[James J. Strang]], and in December 1846 became editor of ''Star in the East'', a Strangite publication printed in Boston.  He then was ordained Strang's counselor in the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]]. In 1850, Adams crowned Strang with a metal crown as a spiritual "king of Israel", and Adams was appointed to be Strang's "[[prime minister]]" and "[[viceroy]]". However, by 1851, Adams had been excommunicated from the Strangite church on recurring charges of [[embezzlement]], [[adultery]], [[apostasy]], and [[drunkenness]].

==Church of the Messiah==
By the late 1850s, Adams had established a church in [[New England]] called the '''Church of the Messiah'''. Adams claimed to be a [[prophet]] of [[Jesus Christ]] to the world and began publication of a periodical called ''The Sword of Truth and Harbinger of Peace''. In 1864, Adams established the headquarters of his church in [[Washington County, Maine]], near the Canada–US border. Later that year, Adams announced a great mission whereby he and his followers would travel to and settle in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Adams taught that their colony could prepare the land for the return of the [[Jew]]s, which in turn would hasten the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus. The members of the church donated much of their money to the church in an effort to realize Adam's proposal.

==Settlement in Palestine==
Adams' friendship with Orson Hyde heavily influenced his decision to move to Palestine.  Hyde was the first Mormon envoy to Jerusalem, and Adams "dreamed of replicating Hyde's pilgrimage to the Holy Land."&lt;ref name = MO&gt;[[Michael Oren]] (2007). ''Power, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East 1776 to the Present'' (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company) p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; After migrating around the Northeast for some years, Adams settled in Indian River, Maine, and prophesied that the prerequisite the Second Coming was "the Jews' restoration to Palestine."&lt;ref name="MO"/&gt;

In 1865, Adams and Indian River's postmaster, Abraham McKenszie, traveled to Palestine and arranged for the purchase of a tract of land near [[Jaffa]].&lt;ref name="MO"/&gt;  Upon returning to the United States, Adams organized the Palestine Emigration Association to coordinate his church's move. In February 1866, Adams was received by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] at the [[White House]]. Seward agreed to expedite a petition from Adams and his church members to the government of the [[Ottoman Empire]] to ensure that the American settlers' title to the land Adams arranged to purchase was respected.

One hundred and fifty-six members of the Church of the Messiah sailed from Boston to Jaffa on the ''Nellie Chapin'', arriving on September 22, 1866. The colony began by camping on the beach, relying on local [[Arab]]s for food and water. Within a month, six children and three adults had died. By November, the colony had erected a number of simple frame houses.

The pilgrims secured a {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot of land outside of Jaffa, where they founded the ''American Colony'', named ''Amelican'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], or ''Adams City'' in English, between today's ''Rechov [[Eilat]]'' and ''Rechov haRabbi mi-[[Bacherach]]'' in [[Tel Aviv-Yafo]]. However, the settlers quickly encountered problems. Scavengers ravaged their crops and the community faced famine heading into the winter of 1866-67.&lt;ref name = MO2&gt;[[Michael Oren]] (2007). ''Power, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East 1776 to the Present'' (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company) p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; This and the climate, the insecure and arbitrary treatment by the Ottoman authorities, made many colonists willing to return to Maine.

But their leader Adams withheld their money, which the colonists had earlier conveyed to him. So the missionary Peter Metzler of the [[Immanuel Church (Tel Aviv-Yafo)#The Jaffa Protestant Mission and the antecedents of the first congregation|Protestant mission in Jaffa]] bought the land of five colonists, providing them the funds to leave.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ejal Jakob Eisler (איל יעקב איזלר), ''Peter Martin Metzler (1824-1907): Ein christlicher Missionar im Heiligen Land'' [פטר מרטין מצלר (1907-1824): סיפורו של מיסיונר נוצרי בארץ-ישראל; German], Haifa: אוניברסיטת חיפה / המכון ע"ש גוטליב שומכר לחקר פעילות העולם הנוצרי בארץ-ישראל במאה ה-19, 1999 ,(פרסומי המכון ע"ש גוטליב שומכר לחקר פעילות העולם הנוצרי בארץ-ישראל במאה ה-19/Abhandlungen des Gottlieb-Schumacher-Instituts zur Erforschung des christlichen Beitrags zum Wiederaufbau Palästinas im 19. Jahrhundert; vol. 2), pp. 46 and לו. {{ISBN|965-7109-03-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams was drinking heavily at the time and had lost his control over the colonists. In April, a group of colonists appealed to the American [[consul (representative)|consul]] to the Ottoman Empire for assistance in returning to America. By the end of the month, the U.S. government had arranged for 26 settlers to return. By the end of summer, after the colony's crop harvest was a disastrous failure, only Adams and 40 other settlers remained. By October 1867, the U.S. [[State Department]] had appropriated $3000 for the return of any of the remaining colonists who wished to leave Palestine, while by December 1867, the colony had run out of money and resources.

Some of the colonists traveled back to America on the ship ''Quaker City''; [[Mark Twain]] was a passenger on the same journey and he wrote about the failed settlers in his chapter 57 of his 1869 book ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''But I am forgetting the Jaffa Colonists. At Jaffa we had taken on board some forty members of a very celebrated community. They were male and female; babies, young boys and young girls; young married people, and some who had passed a shade beyond the prime of life. I refer to the "Adams Jaffa Colony." Others had deserted before. We left in Jaffa Mr. Adams, his wife, and fifteen unfortunates who not only had no money but did not know where to turn or whither to go. Such was the statement made to us. Our forty were miserable enough in the first place, and they lay about the decks seasick all the voyage, which about completed their misery, I take it. However, one or two young men remained upright, and by constant persecution we wormed out of them some little information. They gave it reluctantly and in a very fragmentary condition, for, having been shamefully humbugged by their prophet, they felt humiliated and unhappy. In such circumstances people do not like to talk.''.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to the United States, many of Adams' former followers joined the [[Community of Christ|Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]. In June 1868, Adams and his wife left Palestine and sailed to England. Twenty of the original colonists remained in Palestine, some of them permanently.

The colonists who left would sell much of their real estate in the colony to newly arriving settlers, called [[Templers (religious believers)|Templers]], coming from [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]] in 1869. On 5 March 1869 also Metzler sold most of his real estate to the new colonists, thus ''Adams City'' became later known as the ''German Colony'' of Jaffa.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ejal Jakob Eisler (איל יעקב איזלר), ''Peter Martin Metzler (1824-1907): Ein christlicher Missionar im Heiligen Land'' [פטר מרטין מצלר (1907-1824): סיפורו של מיסיונר נוצרי בארץ-ישראל; German], Haifa: אוניברסיטת חיפה / המכון ע"ש גוטליב שומכר לחקר פעילות העולם הנוצרי בארץ-ישראל במאה ה-19, 1999 ,(פרסומי המכון ע"ש גוטליב שומכר לחקר פעילות העולם הנוצרי בארץ-ישראל במאה ה-19/Abhandlungen des Gottlieb-Schumacher-Instituts zur Erforschung des christlichen Beitrags zum Wiederaufbau Palästinas im 19. Jahrhundert; vol. 2), pp. 46 and לט. {{ISBN|965-7109-03-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to America and death==
Although Adams preached briefly in [[Liverpool]] and tried to raise followers for a second attempt at settling Palestine, he had returned to America by 1870. He preached in [[Philadelphia]] and in 1873 opened a "Church of the Messiah" building for Sunday sermons. When confronted by his past exploits by former followers or others, Adams would deny his identity and past. He died in Philadelphia of "typhoid pneumonia".&lt;ref&gt;Philadelphia ''Public Ledger'', 1880-05-13, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; His only child, Clarence A. Adams, was a [[Baptist]] clergyman in Pennsylvania until his death in the 1920s.

'''Hasbrouck Davis''' (April 19, 1827 –  October 19, 1870) was an American general from [[Massachusetts]]. The son of prominent politician [[John Davis (Massachusetts governor)|"Honest" John Davis]], Davis attended [[Williams College]] and briefly taught before studying to become a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister. He later studied law and moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]] to practice. He was mustered into service with the [[12th Illinois Cavalry]] in 1862, later leading the regiment as a colonel. Late in his war service he was brevetted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]. In 1870, he died in the wreck of the [[SS Cambria (1869)|SS ''Cambria'']].

==Biography==
Hasbrouck Davis was born on April 19, 1827, in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. He was the third son of U.S. Representative and later U.S. Senator [[John Davis (Massachusetts governor)|"Honest" John Davis]]. He attended public schools then matriculated at [[Williams College]] in 1841. He graduated four years later, returning to Worcester to teach at the high school. After a year, he decided to instead pursue a career in the ministry. He studied in [[Heidelberg]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] to study the German language. He returned to Massachusetts in 1849, accepting the pastorship of the [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian]] church in [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]]. Davis preached for only a few years before deciding to step down to study law. He was admitted to the bar in 1854, then opened a law office in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. The next year, Davis decided to head west to [[Chicago, Illinois]], opening a successful firm there.&lt;ref name=memoriam&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=John Chandler Bancroft|authorlink=John Chandler Bancroft Davis|title=In Memoriam: Hasbrouck Davis|year=1871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was mustered into service with the [[12th Illinois Cavalry]] in February 1862 as a lieutenant colonel. Arriving shortly after the [[First Battle of Winchester]], Davis was put in charge of scouting posts. On a mission around [[Bunker Hill, West Virginia]], Davis successfully repelled a Confederate attack. The Confederates counterattacked the next morning, but Davis sent a band of forty troops out near [[Darkesville, West Virginia]]. Under Davis' command, they routed the opposing troops, killing 25, including the grandson of [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], and taking 50 prisoners.&lt;ref name=memoriam/&gt;

In October 1862, the unit's colonel [[Arno Voss]] left for the recruiting serving, putting Davis in charge of the regiment until the next February. The unit saw action at the [[Battle of Harpers Ferry]], escaping the surrounded fortification and taking a band of prisoners in the process. As part of [[Stoneman's 1863 Raid]] during the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]], Davis was ordered to take a brigade to disrupt the [[Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad|Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac]] and [[Virginia Central Railroad]]s. He returned to Illinois with the regiment in November 1863 to reorganize as a veteran regiment.&lt;ref name=memoriam/&gt;

On January 5, 1864, he was promoted to colonel after Voss was forced to discharge due to illness. The regiment was assigned the [[Army of the Gulf]] in [[Louisiana]], fortifying [[Fort Butler (Donaldsonville, Louisiana)|Fort Butler]] near [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana|Donaldsonville]]. On October 31, he was reassigned to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]. The regiment was moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] on January 5, 1865 to scout for [[Embury D. Osband]] and the [[3rd Regiment Cavalry U.S. Colored Troops]]. He was brevetted a [[brigadier general]] on March 12, 1865 and was sent to [[George Armstrong Custer]] in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]]. However, he fell ill and was forced to resign August 1. He returned to Chicago and continued to practice as a lawyer, serving one term as city attorney.&lt;ref name=memoriam/&gt;

Davis married Martha W. Stickney in November 1850; they had four children. In 1870, he boarded the [[SS Cambria (1869)|SS ''Cambria'']] to tour Europe; the vessel sank off the coast of [[Ireland]] on October 19. Davis was one of the 178 lives lost; his body was never recovered.&lt;ref name=memoriam/&gt; A cenotaph was erected in his honor at [[Rural Cemetery (Worcester, Massachusetts)|Rural Cemetery]] in Worcester.

'''Hierarchical temporal memory''' ('''HTM''') is a biologically constrained theory (or model) of intelligence, originally described in the 2004 book ''[[On Intelligence]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-12-04|title=On Intelligence|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_Intelligence&amp;oldid=752902753|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Jeff Hawkins]] with [[Sandra Blakeslee]]. HTM is based on [[neuroscience]] and the [[physiology]] and interaction of [[Pyramidal cell|pyramidal neurons]] in the [[neocortex]] of the [[Mammal|mammalian]] (in particular, human) brain. 

At the core of HTM are learning algorithms that can store, learn, infer and recall high-order sequences. Unlike most other machine learning methods, HTM learns (in an [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] fashion) time-based patterns in unlabeled data on a continuous basis. HTM is robust to noise, and it has high capacity, meaning that it can learn multiple patterns simultaneously. When applied to computers, HTM is well suited for prediction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1162/NECO_a_00893 | volume=28 | title=Continuous Online Sequence Learning with an Unsupervised Neural Network Model | year=2016 | journal=Neural Computation | pages=2474–2504 | last1 = Cui | first1 = Yuwei | last2 = Ahmad | first2 = Subutai | last3 = Hawkins | first3 = Jeff| arxiv=1512.05463 }}&lt;/ref&gt; anomaly detection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.neucom.2017.04.070 | volume=262 | title=Unsupervised real-time anomaly detection for streaming data | year=2017 | journal=Neurocomputing | pages=134–147 | last1 = Ahmad | first1 = Subutai | last2 = Lavin | first2 = Alexander | last3 = Purdy | first3 = Scott | last4 = Agha | first4 = Zuha}}&lt;/ref&gt; classification and ultimately sensorimotor applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://discourse.numenta.org/t/preliminary-details-about-new-theory-work-on-sensory-motor-inference/697|title=Preliminary details about new theory work on sensory-motor inference|website=HTM Forum|language=en|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has been tested and implemented in software through example applications from [[Numenta]] and a few commercial applications from Numenta's partners.

== HTM structure and algorithms ==
A typical HTM network is a [[Tree (data structure)|tree]]-shaped hierarchy of ''levels'' (which should ''not'' be confused with the "''layers''" of the [[neocortex]], as described [[Hierarchical temporal memory#Second generation: cortical learning algorithms|below]]) that are composed of smaller elements called ''region''s (or nodes). A single level in the hierarchy possibly contains several regions. Higher hierarchy levels often have fewer regions. Higher hierarchy levels can reuse patterns learned at the lower levels by combining them to memorize more complex patterns.

Each HTM region has the same basic functionality. In learning and inference modes, sensory data (e.g. data from the eyes) comes into the bottom level regions. In generation mode, the bottom level regions output the generated pattern of a given category. The top level usually has a single region that stores the most general categories (concepts) which determine, or are determined by, smaller concepts in the lower levels which are more restricted in time and space{{clarify|date=August 2018}}. When set in inference mode, a region (in each level) interprets information coming in from its child regions in the lower level as probabilities of the categories it has in memory.

Each HTM region learns by identifying and memorizing spatial patterns, which are combinations of input bits that often occur at the same time. It then identifies temporal sequences of spatial patterns that are likely to occur one after another.

== HTM as an evolving theory==

HTM is an evolving theory (or model), that is, it isn't yet a complete theory, as our knowledge of the [[neocortex]] is incomplete. The new findings on the neocortex are thus progressively incorporated into the HTM model, which can thus change over time. The new findings do not necessarily invalidate the previous ones, so ideas from one generation are not necessarily excluded in its successive one. Because of this evolving nature of the theory, there have been several generations of HTM algorithms &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_wattbWgiU&amp;t= HTM Retrospective]&lt;/ref&gt;, which are briefly described below.

=== First generation: zeta 1 ===

The first generation of HTM algorithms (or the first version of the HTM theory) is sometimes referred to as ''zeta 1''.

==== Training ====

During ''training'', a node (or region) receives a temporal sequence of spatial patterns as its input. The learning process consists of two stages: 

# The '''spatial pooling''' identifies (in the input) frequently observed patterns and memorizes them as "coincidences". Patterns that are significantly similar to each other are treated as the same coincidence. A large number of possible input patterns are reduced to a manageable number of known coincidences.
# The '''temporal pooling''' partitions coincidences that are likely to follow each other in the training sequence into temporal groups. Each group of patterns represents a "cause" of the input pattern (or "name" in ''On Intelligence'').

The concepts of ''spatial pooling'' and ''temporal pooling'' are still quite important in the current HTM theory. Temporal pooling is not yet well understood, and its meaning has changed over time (as the HTM theory evolved).

==== Inference ==== 

During '''inference''', the node calculates the set of probabilities that a pattern belongs to each known coincidence. Then it calculates the probabilities that the input represents each temporal group. The set of probabilities assigned to the groups is called a node's "belief" about the input pattern. (In a simplified implementation, node's belief consists of only one winning group). This belief is the result of the inference that is passed to one or more "parent" nodes in the next higher level of the hierarchy.

"Unexpected" patterns to the node do not have a dominant probability of belonging to any one temporal group, but have nearly equal probabilities of belonging to several of the groups. If sequences of patterns are similar to the training sequences, then the assigned probabilities to the groups will not change as often as patterns are received.  The output of the node will not change as much, and a resolution in time{{clarify|reason=What exactly is meant by "resolution" and "resolution in time" here?|date=August 2018}} is lost.

In a more general scheme, the node's belief can be sent to the input of any node(s) in any level(s), but the connections between the nodes are still fixed. The higher-level node combines this output with the output from other child nodes thus forming its own input pattern.

Since resolution in space and time is lost in each node as described above, beliefs formed by higher-level nodes represent an even larger range of space and time. This is meant to reflect the organization of the physical world as it is perceived by human brain. Larger concepts (e.g. causes, actions and objects) are perceived to change more slowly and consist of smaller concepts that change more quickly. Jeff Hawkins postulates that brains evolved this type of hierarchy to match, predict, and affect the organization of the external world.


More details about the functioning of Zeta 1 HTM can be found in Numenta's old documentation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090527174304/http://numenta.com/for-developers/education/general-overview-htm.php Numenta old documentation]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second generation: cortical learning algorithms ===
The second generation of HTM learning algorithms, often referred to as cortical learning algorithms (CLA), was drastically different from zeta 1. It relies on a [[data structure]] called '''[[Sparse coding|sparse distributed representations]]''' (that is, a data structure whose elements are binary, 1 or 0, and whose number of 1 bits is small compared to the number of 0 bits) to represent the brain activity and a more biologically-realistic neuron model (often also referred to as '''cell''', in the context of the HTM theory).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48r-IeYOvG4 Jeff Hawkins lecture describing cortical learning algorithms]&lt;/ref&gt; There are two core components in this HTM theory: a '''spatial pooling''' algorithm &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3389/fncom.2017.00111 | volume=11 | title=The HTM Spatial Pooler—A Neocortical Algorithm for Online Sparse Distributed Coding | year=2017 | journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | last1 = Cui | first1 = Yuwei | last2 = Ahmad | first2 = Subutai | last3 = Hawkins | first3 = Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which outputs [[Sparse distributed representation|sparse distributed representations]] (SDR), and a '''sequence memory''' algorithm&lt;ref name="Neuronpaper"/&gt;, which learns to represent and predict complex sequences.

In this new generation, the '''[[cerebral cortex#Layers|layers]]''' and '''[[Cortical minicolumn|minicolumns]]''' of the [[cerebral cortex]] are addressed and partially modeled. Each HTM layer (not to be confused with an HTM level of an HTM hierarchy, as described [[Hierarchical temporal memory#HTM structure and algorithms|above]]) consists of a number of highly interconnected minicolumns. An HTM layer creates a sparse distributed representation from its input, so that a fixed percentage of ''[[Cortical minicolumn|minicolumns]]'' are active at any one time{{clarify|reason=What is the connection between the sparse distributed representation and the minicolumns?|date=August 2018}}. A minicolumn is understood as a group of cells that have the same [[receptive field]]. Each minicolumn has a number of cells that are able to remember several previous states. A cell can be in one of three states: ''active'', ''inactive'' and ''predictive'' state.

==== Spatial pooling ====

The receptive field of each minicolumn is a fixed number of inputs that are randomly selected from a much larger number of node inputs. Based on the (specific) input pattern, some minicolumns will be more or less associated with the active input values. '''Spatial pooling''' selects a relatively constant number of the most active minicolumns and inactivates (inhibits) other minicolumns in the vicinity of the active ones. Similar input patterns tend to activate a stable set of minicolumns. The amount of memory used by each layer can be increased to learn more complex spatial patterns or decreased to learn simpler patterns.

===== Active, inactive and predictive cells ===== 

As mentioned above, a cell (or a neuron) of a minicolumn, at any point in time, can be in an active, inactive or predictive state. Initially, cells are inactive.

====== How do cells become active? ====== 

If one or more cells in the active minicolumn are in the ''predictive'' state (see below), they will be the only cells to become active in the current time step. If none of the cells in the active minicolumn are in the predictive state (which happens during the initial time step or when the activation of this minicolumn was not expected), all cells are made active.

====== How do cells become predictive? ======

When a cell becomes active, it gradually forms connections to nearby cells that tend to be active during several previous time steps. Thus a cell learns to recognize a known sequence by checking whether the connected cells are active. If a large number of connected cells are active, this cell switches to the ''predictive'' state in anticipation of one of the few next inputs of the sequence. 

===== The ouput of a minicolumn =====

The output of a layer includes minicolumns in both active and predictive states. Thus minicolumns are active over longer periods of time, which leads to greater temporal stability seen by the parent layer.

==== Inference and online learning ====

Cortical learning algorithms are able to learn continuously from each new input pattern, therefore no separate inference mode is necessary. During inference, HTM tries to match the stream of inputs to fragments of previously learned sequences. This allows each HTM layer to be constantly predicting the likely continuation of the recognized sequences. The index of the predicted sequence is the output of the layer. Since predictions tend to change less frequently than the input patterns, this leads to increasing temporal stability of the output in higher hierarchy levels. Prediction also helps to fill in missing patterns in the sequence and to interpret ambiguous data by biasing the system to infer what it predicted.

==== Applications of the CLAs ====

Cortical learning algorithms are currently being offered as commercial [[SaaS]] by Numenta (such as Grok&lt;ref&gt;[http://grokstream.com/product/ Grok Product Page]&lt;/ref&gt;).

==== The validity of the CLAs ====

The following question was posed to Jeff Hawkins September 2011 with regard to cortical learning algorithms: "How do you know if the changes you are making to the model are good or not?" To which Jeff's response was "There are two categories for the answer:  one is to look at neuroscience, and the other is methods for machine intelligence. In the neuroscience realm there are many predictions that we can make, and those can be tested. If our theories explain a vast array of neuroscience observations then it tells us that we’re on the right track. In the machine learning world they don’t care about that, only how well it works on practical problems. In our case that remains to be seen. To the extent you can solve a problem that no one was able to solve before, people will take notice."&lt;ref name="ai.stanford.edu"&gt;[http://ai.stanford.edu/~joni/papers/LasersonXRDS2011.pdf From Neural Networks to Deep Learning: Zeroing in on the Human Brain]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third generation: sensorimotor inference ===
The third generation builds on the second generation and adds in a theory of sensorimotor inference in the neocortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3389/fncir.2017.00081 | volume=11 | title=A Theory of How Columns in the Neocortex Enable Learning the Structure of the World | year=2017 | journal=Frontiers in Neural Circuits | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = Jeff | last2 = Ahmad | first2 = Subutai | last3 = Cui | first3 = Yuwei}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVT7dO_Tf4E Have We Missed Half of What the Neocortex Does? Allocentric Location as the Basis of Perception]&lt;/ref&gt; This theory proposes that [[cortical column]]s at every level of the hierarchy can learn complete models of objects over time and that features are learned at specific locations on the objects.

==Comparing HTM and neocortex==
HTM attempts to implement the functionality that is characteristic of a hierarchically related group of cortical regions in the neocortex. A ''region'' of the neocortex corresponds to one or more ''levels'' in the HTM hierarchy, while the [[hippocampus]] is remotely similar to the highest HTM level. A single HTM node may represent a group of [[cortical column]]s within a certain region.

Although it is primarily a functional model, several attempts have been made to relate the algorithms of the HTM with the structure of neuronal connections in the layers of neocortex.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeff Hawkins]], [[Sandra Blakeslee]] ''[[On Intelligence]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000532 Towards a Mathematical Theory of Cortical Micro-circuits. Dileep George and Jeff Hawkins. PLoS Computational Biology 5(10)]&lt;/ref&gt; The neocortex is organized in vertical columns of 6 horizontal layers.  The 6 layers of cells in the neocortex should not be confused with levels in an HTM hierarchy.

HTM nodes attempt to model a portion of cortical columns (80 to 100 neurons) with approximately 20 HTM "cells" per column.  HTMs model only layers 2 and 3 to detect spatial and temporal features of the input with 1 cell per column in layer 2 for spatial "pooling", and 1 to 2 dozen per column in layer 3 for temporal pooling. A key to HTMs and the cortex's is their ability to deal with noise and variation in the input which is a result of using a "sparse distributive representation" where only about 2% of the columns are active at any given time.

An HTM attempts to model a portion of the cortex's learning and plasticity as described above. Differences between HTMs and neurons include:&lt;ref&gt;[https://numenta.org/resources/HTM_CorticalLearningAlgorithms.pdf HTM Cortical Learning Algorithms]&lt;/ref&gt;
* strictly binary signals and synapses
* no direct inhibition of synapses or dendrites (but simulated indirectly)
* currently only models layers 2/3 and 4 (no 5 or 6)
* no "motor" control (layer 5)
* no feed-back between regions (layer 6 of high to layer 1 of low)

==Sparse distributed representations==
Integrating memory component with neural networks has a long history dating back to early research in distributed representations&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2841&amp;context=compsci Hinton, Geoffrey E. "Distributed representations." (1984).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/91-1/Papers/006.pdf Plate, Tony. "Holographic Reduced Representations: Convolution Algebra for Compositional Distributed Representations." IJCAI, 1991.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[self-organizing map]]s. For example, in [[sparse distributed memory]] (SDM), the patterns encoded by neural networks are used as memory addresses for [[content-addressable memory]], with "neurons" essentially serving as address [[encoder]]s and decoders.&lt;ref name=kanerva1988&gt;[https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/sparse-distributed-memory Kanerva, Pentti. Sparse distributed memory. MIT press, 1988.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9810/4c7fabf6232715ef2bea1f5b3a3425e1c3af.pdf Snaider, Javier, and Stan Franklin. "Integer sparse distributed memory." Twenty-fifth international flairs conference, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Computers store information in "dense" representations such as a 32 bit word where all combinations of 1s and 0s are possible.
By contrast, brains use sparse distributed representations (SDR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698997001697 | doi=10.1016/S0042-6989(97)00169-7 | volume=37 | title=Sparse coding with an overcomplete basis set: A strategy employed by V1? | year=1997 | journal=Vision Research | pages=3311–3325 | last1 = Olshausen | first1 = Bruno A. | last2 = Field | first2 = David J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human neocortex has roughly 100 billion neurons, but at any given time only a small percent are active. The activity of neurons are like bits in a computer, and therefore the representation is sparse. Similarly to [[Sparse distributed memory|SDM]] developed by [[NASA]] in the 80s&lt;ref name="kanerva1988"/&gt; and [[vector space]] models used in [[Latent semantic analysis]], HTM also uses Sparse Distributed Representations.&lt;ref name="nupicSDRs"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00720 Numenta NUPIC  - Sparse Distributed representations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The SDRs used in HTM are binary representations of data consisting of many bits with a small percentage of the bits active (1s); a typical implementation might have 2048 columns and 64K artificial neurons where as few as 40 might be active at once.  Although it may seem less efficient for the majority of bits to go "unused" in any given representation, SDRs have two major advantages over traditional dense representations.  First, SDRs are tolerant of corruption and ambiguity due to the meaning of the representation being shared (''distributed'') across a small percentage (''sparse'') of active bits.  In a dense representation, flipping a single bit completely changes the meaning, while in an SDR a single bit may not affect the overall meaning much.  This leads to the second advantage of SDRs: because the meaning of a representation is distributed across all active bits, similarity between two representations can be used as a measure of [[semantic]] similarity in the objects they represent.  That is, if two vectors in an SDR have 1s in the same position, then they are semantically similar in that attribute.  The bits in SDRs have semantic meaning, and that meaning is distributed across the bits.&lt;ref name="nupicSDRs"/&gt;

The [[semantic folding]] theory&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08855 Semantic Folding Theory And its Application in Semantic Fingerprinting by Francisco De Sousa Webber]&lt;/ref&gt; builds on these SDR properties to propose a new model for language semantics, where words are encoded into word-SDRs and the similarity between terms, sentences and texts can be calculated with simple distance measures.

== Similarity to other models ==

=== Bayesian networks ===
Likened to a [[Bayesian network]], an HTM comprises a collection of nodes that are arranged in a tree-shaped hierarchy. Each node in the hierarchy discovers an array of causes in the input patterns and temporal sequences it receives. A Bayesian [[belief revision]] algorithm is used to propagate feed-forward and feedback beliefs from child to parent nodes and vice versa. However, the analogy to Bayesian networks is limited, because HTMs can be self-trained (such that each node has an unambiguous family relationship), cope with time-sensitive data, and grant mechanisms for covert attention.

A theory of hierarchical cortical computation based on Bayesian [[belief propagation]] was proposed earlier by Tai Sing Lee and [[David Mumford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.12.2565 Tai Sing Lee, David Mumford "Hierarchical Bayesian Inference in the Visual Cortex"], 2002&lt;/ref&gt; While HTM is mostly consistent with these ideas, it adds details about handling invariant representations in the visual cortex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dileepgeorge.com/blog/?p=5 Hierarchical Bayesian inference in the visual cortex]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neural networks ===
Like any system that models details of the neocortex, HTM can be viewed as an [[artificial neural network]]. The tree-shaped hierarchy commonly used in HTMs resembles the usual topology of traditional neural networks. HTMs attempt to model cortical columns (80 to 100 neurons) and their interactions with fewer HTM "neurons". The goal of current HTMs is to capture as much of the functions of neurons and the network (as they are currently understood) within the capability of typical computers and in areas that can be made readily useful such as image processing.  For example, feedback from higher levels and motor control are not attempted because it is not yet understood how to incorporate them and binary instead of variable synapses are used because they were determined to be sufficient in the current HTM capabilities.

LAMINART and similar neural networks researched by Stephen Grossberg attempt to model both the infrastructure of the cortex and the behavior of neurons in a temporal framework to explain neurophysiological and psychophysical data.  However, these networks are, at present, too complex for realistic application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cns.bu.edu/Profiles/Grossberg/GroCisek2007.pdf Grossberg, S. (2007). Towards a unified theory of neocortex: Laminar cortical circuits for vision and cognition. Technical Report CAS/CNS-TR-2006-008. For Computational Neuroscience: From Neurons to Theory and Back Again, eds: Paul Cisek, Trevor Drew, John Kalaska; Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp. 79-104.]&lt;/ref&gt;

HTM is also related to work by [[Tomaso Poggio]], including an approach for modeling the ventral stream of the visual cortex known as HMAX. Similarities of HTM to various AI ideas are described in the December 2005 issue of the Artificial Intelligence journal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=PublicationURL&amp;_tockey=%23TOC%235617%232005%23998309997%23611936%23FLP%23&amp;_cdi=5617&amp;_pubType=J&amp;_auth=y&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=f615b2c83ddfc9cbdf503c1f05f173d8 ScienceDirect - Artificial Intelligence, Volume 169, Issue 2, Page 103-212 (December 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neocognitron ===
[[Neocognitron]], a hierarchical multilayered neural network proposed by Professor Kunihiko Fukushima in 1987, is one of the first Deep Learning Neural Networks models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Neocognitron Neocognitron at Scholarpedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Suicide sidebar}}
Attitudes toward [[suicide]] have varied through time and across cultures.

==Antiquity and Middle Ages==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
{{Main|Suicide in antiquity}}
In general, the pagan world, both Roman and Greek, had a relaxed attitude towards the concept of suicide. The [[Council of Arles (452)]] stated "if a slave commits suicide no reproach shall fall upon his master."&lt;ref&gt;Hefele, Charles Joseph. ''A History of the Councils of the Church'' Clark, Edinburg, 1883, Canon 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Ages]], the Church had drawn-out discussions on the edge where the search for [[martyrdom]] was suicidal, as in the case of some of the [[martyrs of Córdoba]].

There are some precursors of Christian hostility to suicide in ancient Greek thinkers.  [[Pythagoras]], for example, was against the act, though more on mathematical than moral grounds, believing that there was only a finite number of souls for use in the world, and that the sudden and unexpected departure of one would upset a delicate balance.  [[Aristotle]] also condemned suicide, though for quite different, far more practical reasons, in that it robbed the community of the services of one of its members.  A reading of ''[[Phaedo]]'' suggests that [[Plato]] was also against the practice, inasmuch as he allows [[Socrates]] to defend the teachings of the [[Orphics]], who believed that the human body was the property of the gods, and thus self-harm was a direct offense against divine law.

[[File:La mort de seneque.jpg|thumb|''The death of Seneca'' (1684), painting by [[Luca Giordano]], depicting the suicide of [[Seneca the Younger]] in [[Ancient Rome]].]]
In Rome, suicide was never a general offense in law, though the whole approach to the question was essentially pragmatic. This is illustrated by the example given by [[Titus Livy]] of the colony of [[Marseille|Massalia]] (present day [[Marseilles]]), where those who wanted to kill themselves merely applied to the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], and if their reasons were judged sound they were then given [[conium maculatum|hemlock]] free of charge.  It was specifically forbidden in three cases: those accused of capital crimes, soldiers and slaves.  The reason behind all three was the same - it was ''uneconomic'' for these people to die.  If the accused killed themselves prior to trial and conviction then the state lost the right to seize their property, a loophole that was only closed by [[Domitian]] in the 1st century AD, who decreed that those who died prior to trial were without legal heirs.  The suicide of a soldier was treated on the same basis as desertion.  If a slave killed himself or herself within six months of purchase, the master could claim a full refund from the former owner.

The Romans, however, fully approved of what might be termed "patriotic suicide"; death, in other words, as an alternative to dishonor.  For the [[Stoics]], a philosophical sect which originated in Greece, death was a guarantee of personal freedom, an escape from an unbearable reality that had nothing left to give.  And so it was for [[Cato the Younger]], who killed himself after the Pompeian cause was defeated at the [[Battle of Thapsus]].  This was a 'virtuous death', one guided by reason and conscience.  His example was later followed by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], though under somewhat more straitened circumstances, as he had been ordered to do so on suspicion of being involved with the [[Pisonian conspiracy]] to kill Emperor [[Nero]].  A very definite line was drawn by the Romans between the virtuous suicide and suicide for entirely private reasons.  They disapproved of [[Mark Antony]] not because he killed himself, but that he killed himself for love.

In the [[Middle Ages]], the Christian church [[excommunication|excommunicated]] people who attempted suicide and those who died by suicide were buried outside consecrated graveyards. A criminal ordinance issued by [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1670 was far more severe in its punishment: the dead person's body was drawn through the streets, face down, and then hung or thrown on a garbage heap. Additionally, all of the person's property was confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=ed. by W.S.F.

==Changes in attitude==
[[File:KoKo 1926.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Mikado]]'' musical satirized the illegality of suicide, with Ko-Ko deciding not to kill himself, as it would be a capital offence.]]
Attitudes towards suicide slowly began to shift during the [[Renaissance]]; [[Thomas More]] the English [[humanism|humanist]], wrote in ''[[Utopia]]'' (1516) that a person afflicted with disease can “free himself from this bitter life…since by death he will put an end not to enjoyment but to torture...it will be a pious and holy action”. [[John Donne]]'s work ''[[Biathanatos]]'', contained one of the first modern defences of suicide bringing proof from the conduct of Biblical figures, such as [[Jesus]], [[Samson]] and [[Saul]], and presenting arguments on grounds of reason and nature to sanction suicide in certain circumstances.&lt;ref name="Stanf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/suicide/|title=Suicide|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, loopholes were invented to avoid the damnation that was promised by most Christian doctrine as a penalty of suicide. One famous example of someone who wished to end their life but avoid the eternity in hell was [[Christina Johansdotter]] (died 1740). She was a Swedish murderer who killed a child in Stockholm with the sole purpose of being executed. She is an example of those who seek suicide through execution by committing a murder.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Jeffrey Rodgers (2004) From Sin to Insanity: Suicide in Early Modern Europe
 Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The secularisation of society that began during [[The Enlightenment]] questioned traditional religious attitudes toward suicide to eventually form the modern perspective on the issue. [[David Hume]] denied that suicide was a crime as it affected no one and was potentially to the advantage of the individual. In his 1777 ''Essays on Suicide and the Immortality of the Soul'' he rhetorically asked, “Why should I prolong a miserable existence, because of some frivolous advantage which the public may perhaps receive from me?”&lt;ref Name="Stanf"/&gt; A shift in public opinion at large can also be discerned; ''[[The Times]]'' in 1786 initiated a spirited debate on the motion “Is suicide an act of courage?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bWTcejAzQ8kC|title=A Companion to the Eighteenth-Century English Novel and Culture|author=Paula R. Backscheider, Catherine Ingrassia|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=530|isbn=9781405154505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th-century, the act of suicide had shifted from being viewed as caused by [[sin]] to being caused by [[insanity]] in Europe.&lt;ref name=Maris540/&gt; Although suicide remained illegal during this period, it increasingly became the target of satirical comment, such as the spoof [[advertisement]] in the 1839 ''[[Bentley’s Miscellany]]'' for a ''London Suicide Company'' or the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[The Mikado]]'' that satirised the idea of executing someone who had already killed himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History Of Suicide|url=http://soars.org.uk/index.php/history-of-suicide/a-brief-history-of-suicide|publisher=Society for Old Age Rational Suicide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1879, English law began to distinguish between suicide and [[homicide]], although suicide still resulted in forfeiture of estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=m3pqf8f-6bMC|title=Suicide as a Cultural Institution in Dostoevsky's Russia|author=Irina Paperno|year=1997|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=60|isbn=0801484251}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, the deceased were permitted daylight burial in England&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S60656aS4PAC|title=Life, Death and the Law: Law and Christian Morals in England and the United States|author=Norman St. John-Stevas|year=2002|publisher=Beard Books|page=233|isbn=9781587981135}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the mid 20th century, suicide had become legal in much of the [[western world]].

==Military suicide==
In [[ancient history|ancient]] times, suicide sometimes followed defeat in battle, to avoid capture and possible subsequent [[torture]], mutilation, or [[slavery|enslavement]] by the enemy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} The [[Julius Caesar|Caesarean]] [[assassination|assassin]]s [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]], for example, killed themselves after their defeat at the battle of [[Philippi]]. Insurgent [[Jew]]s died in a mass suicide at [[Masada]] in 74 CE rather than face enslavement by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]].
[[File:USS Essex (CV-9) is hit by a Kamikaze off the Philippines on 25 November 1944.jpg|thumb|right|A Japanese ''[[kamikaze]]'' aircraft explodes after crashing into ''Essex''{{'}} flight deck amidships, 1944.]]
During [[World War II]], Japanese units would often fight to the last man rather than surrender. Towards the end of the war, the Japanese navy sent [[kamikaze]] pilots to attack Allied ships. These tactics reflect the influence of the [[samurai]] warrior culture, where [[seppuku]] was often required after a loss of honor. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In modern times, [[suicide attack]]s have been used extensively by [[Militant Islamist|Islamist militant]]s. However, suicide is strictly forbidden by [[Sharia|Islamic law]], and the terrorist leaders of the Middle Eastern heretic groups who organize these attacks do not regard them as suicide, but as [[martyrdom operation]]s. They argue the difference to be that in suicide a person kills himself out of despair, while in a martyrdom operation a person is killed as a pure act.  This attitude is not universally held by all Muslim clerics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opendemocracy.net/madrid11/suicide_210607]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629115312/http://www.opendemocracy.net/madrid11/suicide_210607 |date=June 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spies have carried suicide pills to use when captured, partly to avoid the misery of captivity, but also to avoid being forced to disclose secrets. For the latter reason, spies may even have orders to kill themselves if captured &amp;ndash; for example, [[Gary Powers]] had a suicide pill, but did not use it when he was captured.

==Social protest==
[[Slavery in the United States|Slave]] suicide in the United States before the [[American Civil War]] has been seen as a social protest. Some slaves were portrayed by abolitionist writers, such as [[William Lloyd Garrison]], as those that ended their lives in response to the hypocrisy of the [[United States Constitution|American Constitution]]. Abolitionists have had differing views on slave suicide. Many cases were published in hope of convincing the public that slaves were protesting the slave society by ending their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Slave Suicide, Abolition and the Problem of Risistance|last = Bell|first = Richard|date = Dec 2012|journal = Slavery &amp; Abolition|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, [[Buddhist]] monks, most notably [[Thích Quảng Đức]], in [[South Vietnam]] gained [[Western world|Western]] praise in their protests against President [[Ngô Đình Diệm]] by [[Self-immolation|burning themselves to death]]. Similar events were reported in eastern Europe, such as [[Jan Palach]] following the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. In 1970 Greek geology student [[Kostas Georgakis]] burned himself to death in [[Genoa]], Italy to protest against the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

During the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China (1966–1976), numerous publicly known figures, especially intellectuals and writers, are reported to have committed suicide, typically to escape persecution, typically at the hands of the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]]. Some, or perhaps many, of these reported suicides are suspected by many observers to have, in fact, not been voluntary but instead the result of mistreatment. Some reported suicides include famed writer [[Lao She]], among the best-known 20th-century Chinese writers, and journalist [[Fan Changjiang]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

[[Eliyahu Rips]], who studied mathematics in [[University of Latvia|Latvian University]], on April 13, 1969 attempted self-immolation at the [[Freedom Monument]] in Riga in order to protest against [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet military invasion of Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lvarhivs.gov.lv/Praga68/index.php?id=10|title = Latvian National archive|date = 2015-12-27|accessdate = 2015-12-27|website = The aftermath of Prague spring and Harta 77 in Baltic countries: The Authority and Dissidents|publisher = Latvian National archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Honor Stephanie Alexander-Harrington''' (née Honor Stephanie Harrington) is a [[fictional character]] invented in 1992 by writer [[David Weber]] as the heroine of the eponymous "[[Honorverse]]", a universe described in a series of best-selling&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Shadow-of-Freedom/David-Weber/Honor-Harrington-Series/9781451638691 |title=Shadow of Freedom |quote=New York Times, USA Today, Wall Street Journal and international bestselling phenomenon David Weber delivers book #18 in the multiple New York Times best-selling Honor Harrington series}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[military science fiction]] books set between 4003 and 4025 AD.

Harrington is an officer in the [[Royal Manticoran Navy]] (RMN), the space navy of the [[Star Kingdom of Manticore]], an interstellar monarchy that counterbalances its relatively small size with superior space combat technology and capability. She has a genius for [[military tactics|tactical]] command, often overcoming significant odds in critical battles and frequently finding herself at the centre of significant military actions. Her dedication to duty and uncompromising performance results in receiving numerous awards and promotions, earning the respect of interstellar empires, and accumulating implacable enemies.  She is a skilled martial artist and through her association with her [[treecat]] companion Nimitz, develops an empathic sense that assists her in understanding the emotions of those around her.

==Early life==
Honor was born on October 1, 3961 AD (1859 PD), at Craggy Hollow (the municipal suburb community of the Harrington family home), County Duvalier, in the Duchy of Shadow Vale on the planet [[Sphinx (Honorverse)|Sphinx]], in the Manticore [[binary star]] system. Sphinx is the second inhabited planet with a long slow orbital year and long seasons orbiting around the star'' 'Manticore A' ''of the three inhabited planets of [[Star Kingdom of Manticore]], located much farther out in the liquid water zone than the planet Manticore, which is nearer the inner margin of inhabitable zone, whereas the third inhabited world Gryphon orbits'' 'Manticore B'.'' Her ancient house and the Harrington family seat dates back to the second migration and first settlements of Sphinx and is located near the city of Yawata Crossing, which will become nearly destroyed by huge pieces of the destroyed space station, HMSS Vulcan, during the sneak attack by the Mesan Alignment in 4025 AD (1922 PD).&lt;ref name="HH-MoH"&gt;[[Mission of Honor]], Honor Harrington #12 (HH12)&lt;/ref&gt; She is the daughter of neurosurgeon Alfred Harrington and physician/geneticist Allison Benton-Ramirez y Chou Harrington, both with towering renown and fame of their own among the Manticore and Beowulf medical establishments; and her father is known to have one of the most beneficial and dominant genetically modified gene variations that he has passed onto Honor. A former officer in Manticore's Naval Medical system, he is well regarded by the Manticore admiralty as well.

===Class background===
Socially, by virtue of her father's ancestry, she was born a [[yeoman]]—meaning that she is a descendant of paying settlers of the second wave of settlement of the Star Kingdom of Manticore, not a member of the [[nobility]]—who for the most part can claim descent from the first colonists who invested in the joint venture purchasing settlement rights to the new system and who subsequently underwrote the migration of that first wave of colonists in slow ships to Manticore. Yeomen are socially ranked above a '' 'zero balancer' ''— someone who could not afford to buy passage to Manticore during the second 'faster than light' migration wave, nor had valuable skills that the colonial government induced to migrate with favorable terms, but whom the administration offered passage with a term of indenture required to pay back the colony.

Officially, yeomen have ancestors whose skills were in enough demand that Manticore paid their way. Her mother is a direct immigrant from the long settled planet Beowulf, which is known for its strong research and practice in the life sciences, and it is revealed in ''[[A Rising Thunder]]'', her brother is one of its planetary directors&amp;mdash;and both siblings are from Beowulf family famous for its intellectual, especially medical abilities, making them something of a noble house in Beowulfian regard. Beowulf was one of Earth's original daughter colonies in the early [[diaspora]] which is dated to have begun in 2102 AD, and further Beowulf connects directly to Manticore via a Wormhole, ''the 'Beowulf-Manticore Bridge' '' and the two populations have much intermarried and cross-migrated, giving Beowulf and Manticore an extremely close interstellar relationship.

===Genetic heritage and background===
Since Honor Harrington's paternal ancestors were "genies", people [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] (specifically with the Meyerdahl Beta modification) to survive on high gravity planets such as Sphinx, she not only benefits from the enhanced intellect associated with that genetic heritage but is even stronger and quicker than non-genies who grow up in the heavier gravity of Sphinx. As revealed in ''[[In Enemy Hands (novel)|In Enemy Hands]]'', this Meyerdahl Beta modification gives her more efficient [[muscle]]s, enhanced reaction speed, stronger [[bone]]s, tougher [[Cardiovascular system|cardiovascular]] and [[respiratory system]]s, high metabolic rate, and a higher than average [[intelligence quotient]]. Her maternal ancestry mostly originated from [[Asia]], which manifests in her facial features and coloring. The Mesan Alignment is conducting its string pulling behind the interstellar political events in an attempt to overthrow the Solarian League and its early laws outlawing genetic engineering upon man and genetic slaves in general as pushed into law by the highly prestigious daughter colony Beowulf after "Earth's Final War" where genetically altered soldiers and their genetically enhanced leadership played a horrific role and took decades to defeat. It took further decades, even centuries, for Beowulf and sister colonies to undo much of the genetic damage that had occurred to Old Terra's population during the long chain of prelude conflicts leading to the final war.

Harrington was raised in the Third Stellar Missionary Communion (Reformed), but is only privately religious, as the sect is not evangelistic. Her behavior on Grayson as a Steadholder and when marrying in ''[[Mission of Honor]]'' demonstrates she has a quiet personal faith she does not push on others.

===Treecat influences===
Honor is one of the few people adopted by a Sphinxian [[treecat]], a telempathic intelligent indigenous species&amp;mdash;who spent much of their history with humanity scouting and concealing their true abilities from mankind. The adoption process is involuntary and uncontrollable and strikes like'' 'Love at First Sight','' known to human experience, but strikes much more powerfully. The bonding is more of a recognition of something that was missing suddenly being complete and so right that life without the new bond is unthinkable. So striking suddenly, the mutual adoptions are essentially an empathic life-bond, and hers occurred during Honor's childhood (age 11 Earth years), a rarity since most adoptions involve adult humans. She had dubbed her 'cat Nimitz (after World War II Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]]), although to his own people he has been known as "Laughs Brightly", a member of a clan that lives near her home, and in the treecat community, formerly being one of their scouts by occupation, as are most adopted cats since they most often interact with the humans they are spying upon.

Honor is known to the treecats as "Dances on Clouds" for her frequent climbs up into the Copperwall Mountains overlooking her parent's house to launch a hang glider with Nimitz on her back. Having conducted considerable research, she is one of the foremost experts on treecats, and is a descendant of and in-part named after Stephanie Harrington—who was the first human to bond with Treecats when she figured out what was occurring in ''the Great Disappearing Celery mystery''&lt;ref 
name="CQ"&gt;World's of Honor #1, [[More Than Honor]]'', 'A Beautiful Friendship'.''
&lt;/ref&gt; and ambushed ''Climbs Quickly'' in the act of treecat burglary—surprising both races with the resultant bonding that nearly ended the life of both sapients.
 
Improving upon all her ancestor's knowledge, for many other ancestors had been subsequently adopted in the intervening centuries and these kept diaries or journals, Honor enjoys a closer [[empathic]] link with Nimitz than any before known link between the two species. Her link to Nimitz had initially grown over thirty some T-years to become so deep as to allow her to "taste" the emotions of other humans around her through Nimitz in the earlier works of the series&amp;mdash;for example when she foiled the attempt to assassinate the Protector of Grayson in the second novel, ''[[The Honor of the Queen]]''. Later books dropped hints that Honor may be developing empathic talents of her own even as her life became complicated by the courtship, marriage and pregnancy of Nimitz's mate Samantha in ''[[Honor Among Enemies]]''. This hint of psi talents blossomed under stress during her captivity on the way to the prison planet Hades when she was held far apart from Nimitz (in ''[[In Enemy Hands (novel)|In Enemy Hands]])'', and thereafter gradually became an overt capability she initially preferred not to have, then accepted by Honor and subsequently figured out by her very closest associates. The ability grew gradually into a formidable ability to "read people correctly" as perceived by outsiders, but was from the start always a closely guarded secret as it gradually became suspected by friends and associates as the extraordinary capability it has become. Her legend was also picked up by foreign flag diplomatic and intelligence appreciations about her, especially from Manticore and in private back channels of the Manticorian Admiralty. Eventually, it became overtly recognized by her closest confidants and suspected by a few selected foreigners.

Weber then further segued the ability during political crises management into a nearly open secret acknowledged to various other high-ranking allies in the novels after ''[[Ashes of Victory]]''. For example, in ''[[A Rising Thunder]]'' this point is directly addressed in dialog with the Haven diplomatic delegation visiting Manticore in the discussion about whether the Mesan Alignment could actually exist&amp;mdash;in short for her to detail what she sensed from the just concluded briefing by Herlander Simões, the Mesan physicist who had defected from the Mesan Alignment when the diplomats were again alone in session.

Honor's career and the success of the collected works in the Honorverse really can't be understood without her association with Nimitz and then, through him, her association to other Treecats&amp;mdash;including to all of the Treecat race, as is gradually revealed through stories such as ''Changer of Worlds'' where the Treecat community is seen to be endorsing Samantha and Nimitz's decision to migrate with volunteers and their kittens off planet. The encounter and other short stories in the anthologies provides much deep background about human-treecat relations, and reveal, as explicitly stated in ''A Rising Thunder'' in exposition to the Haven delegation, the Treecat elders and society as a whole have effective recordings of their experiences with humanity through the offices of their Memory Singers, like Samantha, and further they confer planetwide about decisions regarding their relationships with humanity. In that thirteenth Honor Harrington novel, the Treecat Memory Singers are explicitly examining their collective memory to aid the alliance forming to oppose the Mesan Alignment cum Solarian League war. One result is the Treecats 'enlist' in the alliance to act as truth detectors and as a counter to the demonstrated Mesan ability to cause many trusted individuals to perform adverse functions that are concurrently suicidal, they are a new type of security for the new alliance&amp;mdash;counter-anti-nanite-controlled-assassins and spy detectors.

==Career==

===At the Academy===
Harrington attended the Royal Manticoran Navy's Saganami Naval Academy on Manticore's [[Saganami Island]], and became an officer in the [[Royal Manticoran Navy]]. One of the RMN's best tacticians, she can make effective tactical evaluations, often quickly and intuitively. She also became a [[sailplane]] pilot.  Her mathematical aptitude and navigational skills are excellent, but her poor performance in mathematics courses was the source of much irritation, and more than a few problems, while at the Academy. At Saganami Island, her roommate and best friend was [[Michelle Henke|Michelle "Mike" Henke]], paternal first cousin of Queen [[Elizabeth III of Manticore]]. Having been shy and lacking in self-confidence, Harrington learned much from "Mike" Henke during those years.

Also at the Academy, Harrington unwittingly became the target of a perverse, boorish midshipman, Lord [[Pavel Young]], heir to the Earldom of North Hollow. When he attempted to rape her in the showers, she defended herself, sending him to the hospital. Although the Academy Commandant suspected the truth, her shame and low self-esteem kept her from disclosing the details or pressing formal charges. Young thus escaped with a reprimand for conduct unbecoming rather than dismissal from the Academy. Her outstanding abilities (along with some behind the scenes maneuvering by her mentor, Raoul Courvosier) enabled her career to progress steadily, if erratically, despite the enmity of the Young clan and various attempts by it and its allies to sabotage her RMN career.

Her midshipwoman or "snotty" cruise aboard HMS ''War Maiden'' under Captain Bachfisch allowed her to demonstrate her ability as a combat tactician when, during an engagement with [[Silesian Confederacy|Silesian]] rebels, the rest of the command team was killed, disabled, or cut off from the rest of the ship. She assumed command, and after finishing off the opposing ship, was promoted ahead of her class to [[ensign (rank)|ensign]].

===In command===

====Early commands====
Harrington's first command is a Light Attack Craft; she is later given command of the destroyer HMS ''Hawkwing'', and after a year of service goes to the RMN's Advanced Tactical Course. Harrington graduates high in her class from the ATC, and immediately assumes command of the light cruiser HMS ''Fearless'' as a Commander. Her exploits while posted at [[On Basilisk Station|Basilisk Station]] bring her widespread fame — and an ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' sentence of death from the [[People's Republic of Haven]]. Now firmly on the fast track to senior rank, she proves to have something akin to the [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson#Legacy|Nelson touch]], earning the devotion of her officers and enlisted personnel, as well as the high regard of both Manticore's allies (especially [[Grayson (Honorverse)|Grayson]]), and her military opponents. However, she also makes new political enemies and suffers several personal losses, including the murder of her lover by a professional duelist sent by Pavel Young.

====In the news====
During the closing events in the second novel, ''[[The Honor of the Queen]]'', Harrington received a letter of reprimand for striking a crown envoy and a cautionary and serious but almost pro-forma dressing down by Admiral of the Green Hamish Alexander. The dressing down was very public,  witnessed by the Manticore Ambassador to Grayson and the Grayson head of state. Its sting was reduced, however, by Harrington's knighting moments later by the Ambassador. At the same time, Harrington was awarded several medals, ennobled by Grayson as one of its few Steadholders, and further ennobled in the Star Kingdom as Countess Harrington.
 
The crown envoy in question was Reginald Houseman, who had ordered the illegal evacuation of Manticorans from Grayson after the First Battle of Yeltsin.  Houseman had made the mistake of personally threatening to ruin Harrington's career for refusing to abandon Grayson to her enemies; Harrington lost her temper and slapped Houseman hard enough to fling him across the room with a bloody nose and mouth. After a year's convalescent leave, having lost her eye among other damages in the engagements in Yeltsin in defense of Grayson, she was given the newly commissioned state-of-the-art Battlecruiser ''Nike'' and made flag captain of a new squadron, both professional plums demonstrating the high regard she'd earned in her first navy, before again encountering Captain Pavel Young&amp;mdash;whose career was decidedly going the other direction. 
 
Attached to a cruiser squadron assigned as screening elements for her Battlecruiser squadron in ''[[The Short Victorious War]]'', Young demonstrated cowardice in the books' finale as Haven finally began the war long expected by both sides in its opening bid to conquer Manticore and its alliance against Haven. Prior to Young's arrival on the forward base called Hancock Station, Honor had become romantically entangled with his former executive officer stationed there as engineering staff and whom Young blamed in part for troubles he'd experienced after trying to stick it to Honor in the first book. He took note of their relationship during his court martial, seeing them holding hands.

====A political target====
Thus, ''[[Field of Dishonor]]'' begins with his court martial and cashiering, and continues with his decision as ''Lord North Hollow'' to take revenge upon Honor, the navy, and his former executive officer and Honor's de facto fiance, Paul Tankersley. North Hollow pays an assassin to have Tankersley killed in a staged duel so as to hurt Harrington, expecting the killer to also kill Honor afterwards. She'd taken leave to be invested as and  undertake her Grayson duties as Steadholder Harrington while ''Nike'' was being repaired after the battle for Hancock. Captain Tankersley was killed while Honor was over a week away on Grayson, but North Hollow was deliberately betrayed by his own security chief and direct action specialist, a woman whom he held to his service under threat of blackmail&amp;mdash;a family specialty that gave the Earldom much political power for it held the much feared 'North Hollow Files' with devastating dirt on many Manticorian politicians. She was also forced to service his rather sickening and exotic sexual appetites and the thought of endless years of having to service him made it easy to betray him.

====An infamous duelist====
With this plot uncovered and herself named as North Hollow's next victim, Honor felt she had no choice but to challenge him directly to a duel when he'd attempted to murder her by employing a crew of other paid assassins in a public restaurant. Because he was a sitting member of Parliament, the opposition parties united in protest so Harrington was beached by the Manticoran Navy for her duel with Pavel Young on political grounds setting the backstory for ''[[Flag in Exile]]''. Moving to Harrington Steading during her unemployment, she finds herself at the heart of political dissent, turmoil, discord and counter-cultural forces opposing the reforms instituted by Protector [[Benjamin Mayhew]] and especially opposing such ungodly concepts such as female Steadholders and women officers. The conspiracy hopes to discredit her by sabotaging the work performed by one of her companies while the Grayson Space Navy (GSN) eventually recruits her, making her the second ranking admiral in their young, rapidly expanding navy. The sabotage works in part, killing hundreds for which Honor is blamed for a time but the conspiracy is revealed through good forensic engineering and is then dealt with effectively just in time for a battle fleet to come calling on the GSN. Wounded and exhausted from events on the ground over the preceding week, Harrington gets up after only an hour's sleep and again saves the planet from invasion, this time by hoodwinking a superior Haven task force into a tactically bad position then defeating it, earning the Swords (a repeat of the decoration) to her Star of Grayson. After three years as a key figure in the burgeoning Grayson navy, units are available for other than system defense and begin joining the RMN which is straining to maintain offensive momentum against Haven. Honor is again offered starship command in the RMN; offered the ability to 'redeem' her place in the RMN through a proposal made by her political enemies who have become desperate to do something, anything to oppose the costly crippling piracy in the Silesian Confederation.

====Rehabilitated by the opposition====
She is given command of four [[Q-ship]]s as a de facto [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] and starship captain&amp;mdash; four converted merchant ships turned into [[merchant cruiser]]s, but given impressive missile and energy armaments, an improved inertial compensator system, particle shielding scaled up to go with the increased acceleration abilities, and sidewalls allowing head to head combat with light combat units up to Battlecruiser grade opponents. These cruisers were also made into [[light carrier]]s similar to the [[escort carrier]]s created on merchant hulls during [[World War II]], and able to carry a dozen new and advanced light attack craft. Her experience with these units, results in the militarily revolutionary pod-superdreadnaught classes which will come to dominate the new military reality.  In this command, she rescues a planet from a pirate flotilla, defeats a Havenite commerce raiding fleet and makes a relationship with a senior officer of the Andermani Empire.

====Commodore Harrington====
When Harrington is captured by Haven en route to a new command in ''[[In Enemy Hands (novel)|In Enemy Hands]]'' (HH-07), the death sentence for the Basilisk Station action&amp;mdash;delivered ''in absentia'' in a show trial under the pre-revolutionary government of old Haven&amp;mdash;is ordered to be carried out by the new revolutionary regime. En route to the secret prison planet of Hades, Chief Petty Officer Horace Harkness, who'd been dissembling as a traitor, hacks into the ship's computers and stages a well timed jail break when her ship, PNS Tepes, arrives in orbit. Honor loses an arm in the ensuing action, an action which also takes the lives of a number of subordinates dear to her heart. However, after coaxing one shuttle to mimic a pilot attempting to flee, and another to bring up its impeller drive inside the boat bay, her party manages to escape when the drive wedge of the shuttle-turned-bomb destroys the PNS (People's Navy Ship) ''Tepes'' and kills the worst member of Haven's ruling triumvirate, [[Cordelia Ransom]], whose specialty is class warfare. Harrington's shuttles escape and hide on the planet's surface, going unnoticed in the debris field, save for suspicions by the tactical officer and commander of a PNS navy vessel friendly to Honor.

As ''[[Echoes of Honor]]'' begins, assuming Harrington was also killed on Hades, the PRH propaganda office releases a fake video recording of her "execution". As a result, simultaneous state funerals were staged for her on both Manticore and Grayson, while she is recuperating and formulating plans to take over the planet's management. The Royal Manticoran Navy renames the new ''Medusa'' class she had helped inspire to the ''Harrington'' class in her honor, although she convinces them to retract the change when she returns. The Grayson Space Navy christens their lead starship in their parallel class the GNS ''Honor Harrington''. Despite her similar protests upon her return, the Graysons find various inventive reasons to avoid renaming it, or for removing the 4 meter tall heroic statue sitting atop an 8-meter column depicting her martyred self outside the main entrance to Grayson's Parliament building –— much to her embarrassment.

Working with the equipment of the two fully outfitted assault shuttles her crew had escaped with, the escaped prisoners monitor Hell's communications bands and develop a picture of normal operations on the prison world. In the process, they find the enemy has concentrated the one group of individuals they most want to enlist to aid them in a single camp. These prisoners are the recalcitrant troublemakers who are also ex-military officers from the various planets the Peoples Republic had conquered in recent decades. After using this group as an assault force, the one shuttle with working IFF successfully masquerades as a guards unit and drops the force inside the defense perimeter of the base, successfully capturing it. The other shuttle drives up to orbit and neutralizes the People's courier boat before it can leave orbit and raise an alarm. Superior Manticore educations again give the party an edge allowing the new management to successfully hack into the planetary computers where they successfully capture a PNS fleet with transports and escape to allied territories with a record number of prisoners, including political and military figures the universe believes executed in the revolution long before. They also have records and interviews revealing who is really behind the revolution and the bloody attack on the former government of the [[People's Republic of Haven]].

====Admiral Harrington====
Forced to undergo extensive reconstructive surgery for the missing limb and re-rehabilitate the prior reconstructive surgery to her face and eye which the Peep guards had short circuited, ''[[Ashes of Victory]]'' (HH-12) assigns the newly minted Duchess Harrington to teach at the alliance's premier naval academy Saganami Island, and to command the Advanced Tactical Simulator (ATC) which is co-sited on the base. She is jumped three grades in Manticorian service (skipping the ranks of rear admiral and vice admiral), giving her the rank necessary for the post. Her involvement with fleet is indirect but extensive from both these training commands as she is also tasked with modeling and simulating the mix of advanced weapons that have suddenly become available from development of a small fusion reactor that can ride on a missile or other small platform. Her team at ATC thus develops and games the fleet doctrines soon used by the upgraded fleets in being, and especially the offensive arm, the Eighth Fleet under Admiral Alexander. ATC is normally a senior Admiral's billet, and the Admiralty insists she not complain for achieving the rank the command believes she would have achieved without the political opposition in her past.

Her tactics and strategies developed at ATC are adopted almost without change by Eighth Fleet in its new offensive using the new technologies of Ghost Rider, LAC strike Carriers, and Pod-Superdreadnaughts. At the end of Ashes of Victory, Honor pilots her intrasystem yacht to prevent a missile strike launched by assassins against the Queen's spaceship, thereby saving Queen Elizabeth and Protector Benjamin, but not preventing the missile targeted on the ship containing the two star nation's prime ministers and other cabinet rank officials. The government falls, and the new government is made up of a coalition of parties inimical to Honor and the Queen with no real interest of settling the war with Haven, and the new management in the Admiralty puts Honor and Admiral White Haven on half pay, so the two become the voice of the loyal opposition in the upper house of the Manticoran Parliament.

====Honor the politician====
The new government is corrupt and venal, looking for ways to take money from military projects and under the slogan of 'building the peace', divert the same tax base to pet projects where they can have minions siphon off funds to contributors and personal wealth, while simultaneously maintaining the state of emergency that prevents an automatic election because of pending changes in the house of Lords due to the annexation of Trevor's Star into the Star Kingdom. Having become a political thorn in the side of the government for over three years, the government concocts ways to eliminate the popularity of Honor and Hamish Alexander, promoting a slime campaign depicting the two as sexual partners. Despite Alexander's pre-existing marriage, the pair defuse the situation by entering into a polygamic marriage. The government then decides the deteriorating situation in Silesia warrants sending Honor in command of a fleet to check expansionist activity by the Andermani Empire. ''[[War of Honor]]'' details this political backstory and the military build down by the corrupt government which is also antagonizing its allies as well as the new Haven government under President Eloise Pritchart which is trying to make a peace settlement.  While most spending programs are corrupt, one which was designed to siphon funds to the government's special interests, actually pays off by discovering a new wormhole terminus. The new government of Haven is tired of being put off in the peace talks and having received tech upgrades from a secret research and development program feels they can restore their fleet to primacy by taking out construction suspended by the High Ridge government and attacking the weakened Manty garrison forces in a strategic order. Hearing that Honor is being given a weak fleet in Silesian space, the planners reason that they can also attack there and neutralize that bogie-man and deal a  blow to Manticorian morale.
 
Honor is sent with an inadequate RMN force, but Protector Benjamin insists on reinforcing her with the special unit, The Protector's Own, of which she is the permanent commanding officer. Getting a whiff from an intelligence source, she mousetraps the Havenite Fleet even as all the other Haven attacks go home successfully pushing the Manticoran Fleet back from all the systems they'd conquered and destroying their picket units. The worst damages are to the extensive satellite ship yards in the Grendlesbane Star System where much new construction was suspended and had to be destroyed before the Havenite Fleet could capture it.

====RMN Fleet Admiral====
The corrupt government seeks to form a coalition war cabinet, but the Queen blocks the effort, so the government falls, returning the Crown Loyalists and Centrist coalition to power under the brother of Hamish Alexander, who is made First Lord of the Admiralty&amp;mdash;with the government needing someone trustworthy to undo the damage imposed by the High Ridge administration.

In ''[[At All Costs]]'', Honor is given command of the Eighth Fleet, a heavy assault force of advanced capital ships, and new weapons of unmatched abilities. But overall, the Manticoran fleet has become severely weakened, and she must devise a strategy to keep the Republic of Haven off balance until the fleet can be built up. Under her leadership, the fleet begins a campaign to dismantle the industrial base of the Republic of Haven, by sailing deep behind enemy lines and raiding Havenite space based infrastructure, forcing the republic to go on the defensive and worry which of its systems will suffer next. Haven deploys a counter strategy that eventually causes severe damage to Eighth fleet during one raid when they use her own tactics from Silesian space against her forces, and the offensive campaign is temporarily put on hold. During this battle, Michelle Henke is captured by the Republic of Haven, setting the stage for ''[[Storm from the Shadows]]''.

Manticore then fields a new weapon system, "Apollo", that not only neutralizes the new system defense systems Haven is deploying, but also turns the tide of the war, as it renders modern missile defensive systems effectively worthless, and further, capitalizes on the new MDM Ghost Rider missiles that have been in the field by enhancing their long range accuracy. Realizing his nation's poor strategic position, Admiral Thomas Theisman of Haven resolves to launch one final massive, desperate strike on the Manticore system itself, hoping to end the war before Apollo can be widely distributed in the field to all units by the Royal Manticoran Navy. This attack almost succeeds and completely destroys most of the Manticoran fleet protecting the home system, and almost as much of Third Fleet, normally deployed to defend the Trevor's Star wormhole terminus deep within the spatial volume of the Republic of Haven.

At the last moment, Honor and Eighth Fleet arrives coming through the wormhole from Trevor's Star as well and equipped with Apollo, use it to decimate the sole strong remaining attacking Havenite fleet and threaten the remnant forces still in the battleground&amp;mdash;forcing their capitulation and capture. Involving hundreds of ships of the wall on both sides, the [[Battle of Manticore]] is the largest naval engagement in human history, and it is extremely costly for both sides. Honor's long time friend [[Alistair McKeon]] is killed, and most of the Manticoran Navy's non-Pod capital ships are destroyed (Eighth Fleet is the only remaining combat ready force, aside from miscellaneous units—garrison, in transit, in refit, ...). Eighth Fleet assumes the duties and title of Home Fleet (the defense of the Manticore system itself). Haven loses more than 90% of the forces deployed during the attack, and its best tactician, [[Lester Tourville]], is captured after he surrenders what remains of his force to Honor. An effective truce between the two sides goes into effect, as neither nation possesses the capability to continue offensive operations. Honor mourns McKeon's death in a dramatic scene at the end of the novel.

====Honor the Diplomat====
Events in a new addition to the Star Kingdom, the Talbott Cluster, grow more problematic. The megalomaniac outlaw corporation [[Manpower Incorporated (Honorverse)|Manpower Incorporated]] and the planet 'Mesa' continue their plans to dislodge Manticore from the cluster, and they immediately put another plan into action, following the failure of their first attempts as recounted in ''[[The Shadow of Saganami]]''. They seek to start a conflict between Manticore and the [[Solarian League]] in order to remove the Cluster from the Star Kingdom and for other, as yet unknown, reasons. Despite Haven's attack on Manticore, Honor is shown in ''[[Storm from the Shadows]]'' as an advocate for at least partial reconciliation with Haven, as it increasingly appears that war with the Solarian League is inevitable. During her brief appearance in ''Storm'', Honor discusses potential long-term strategy against the Solarian League with the Manticoran leadership, including Queen Elizabeth, whom she persuades to give the Solarian threat a priority over Haven.

In ''[[Mission of Honor]]'', Admiral Harrington is assigned as envoy to Haven.  After a successful attack by the Mesa Alignment Navy on the Space Stations of the Manticore home system, Harrington helps bring about an alliance between the Star Empire and Haven against Mesa / Manpower. She subsequently becomes the first commanding officer of the newly created, multinational Grand Fleet.

===Summary===
In the course of her career, Honor Harrington becomes a [[Duchess]] of the [[Star Kingdom of Manticore]], a Grayson [[Steadholder]], and an Admiral in both the Grayson Space Navy and the Royal Manticoran Navy. She also earns several medals for bravery, including the Parliamentary Medal of Valor for saving both Queen Elizabeth III and Protector Benjamin Mayhew IX (the heads of state of Manticore and Grayson respectively) from a surprise attack. She earned the Star of Grayson for saving Grayson from a Masadan attack as well as saving Protector Benjamin and his family during the Maccabeus coup assassination attempt. She is the only living holder of the Star of Grayson, and the first in six hundred years to receive it twice, as noted by the crossed swords beneath. She receives the Monarch's Thanks on several occasions, including her role in search and rescue efforts during an avalanche on Gryphon and her handling of an accident on HMS ''Manticore''.

Honor Harrington's rank and titles as of the end of the events in ''[[At All Costs]]'' include ''Admiral of the Fleet and Captain HMS ''Unconquered'' Lady Dame Honor Stephanie Alexander-Harrington, Steadholder Harrington, Duchess Harrington, Countess White Haven''. This makes her the fifth highest-ranking person in the Manticoran aristocracy (only the Grand Dukes of Manticore, Sphinx, Gryphon and Queen Elizabeth rank higher). Her claim to "Countess White Haven" is unclear but arguable, since she is [[Hamish Alexander|Earl White Haven]]'s second wife (a case of [[polygamy]]), but in any event is not held in her own right. In many respects, Steadholder Harrington, Duchess Harrington, and each of the Admirals Harrington are different entities inhabiting the same body. Due to recognition of her status as Steadholder by the Manticoran Foreign Office and the backing of the Queen, Steadholder Harrington's Grayson armsmen (personal bodyguards  mandated by Grayson law) are permitted to accompany her armed on RMN vessels, as required by Grayson law. This has led to several situations in which Honor has been accompanied by armed men in her service to places where such would never be ordinarily permitted, such as the Queen's residence at Mount Royal Palace.

==Character trademarks==
Honor is physically very tall at 188&amp;nbsp;cm (6 feet 2 inches in height).  This is a source of much humor in the series, especially when compared to her "tiny" mother [[Allison Harrington]].

Honor Harrington has a cool soprano voice, and slightly almond shaped brown eyes.

Honor is recognized as a great teacher both in the classroom and shipboard environments and has a calm, tolerant management style.  Her subordinates have ample opportunity to learn from their mistakes and improve performance; the Bureau of Personnel has noted a distinct increase in efficiency from her subordinates.  She rarely loses her temper without severe provocation (although when she does get angry this usually results in devastating if not fatal consequences for the object of her anger).  Warning signs include a flat, deadly calm tone in her voice, a facial tic in the right corner of her mouth and more obvious warning signals that Nimitz gives such as flattened ears, hissing, and tail twitches that are exactly in time with Honor's facial tic.  Her most loyal subordinates, including Scotty Tremaine, Alistair McKeon and Andrew LaFollet, are very aware of these warning signs and will sometimes intervene to stop her. (''The Honor of the Queen, Echoes of Honor'').

Honor loathes coffee and considers hot cocoa far superior.

She regularly is seen drinking "Old Tilman" beer from a bottle.

She owns and practices with a replica Colt [[M1911]] [[.45 ACP|.45 caliber]] [[Semi-automatic firearm|semiautomatic]] [[pistol]], a weapon considered to be an anachronistic "hand cannon" by her contemporaries, who prefer pulsers, which fire small-[[Caliber|calibre]] [[Explosive material|high explosive]] [[Dart (missile)|darts]] at extremely high velocity using a gravitic propulsion system. She acquired a taste for obsolete handarms from her uncle, Jacques Chou, who is an active member of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]]. His training made her a pistol expert (useful on Sphinx outside its protected areas, given its native predators).

Honor lost her left eye while defending Protector Benjamin Mayhew from an assassination attempt. The eye was replaced with a prosthetic, though on occasion it has been disabled (as when she was captured and transported to Hades). Additionally, some of the nerves on the left side of her face were damaged during the same incident, and were replaced with artificial nerves.

Most of her left arm was lost during the escape from the ''PNS Tepes'' and was replaced by a cybernetic arm which, among other interesting features, contains a hidden pulser pistol inside the index finger.  Its sight is slaved to her prosthetic eye via a small video camera embedded in the [[cuticle]].

Honor practices a fictional martial art known as ''coup de vitesse'' (French for ''blow of speed''). This is a fusion of several Western and Asian martial arts, where emphasis is placed on offense at the expense of defense, resulting in a very brutal and effective style.  As of ''[[War of Honor]]'', Honor has earned an eighth level black belt. There is only one higher rank. Her proficiency has saved her and others several times.

Honor has become proficient with the Grayson style of swordplay, involving a blade very similar to the [[katana]], which by a quirk of history is used ceremonially by Steadholders and is the center of a martial art on Grayson. The sword style of the Graysons is derived from the film ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'' - presumably the [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]] version - the only recording of swordplay that existed on Grayson once their culture had devolved to the point where swords were desired.

Honor has a mental block regarding mathematics, despite her high intelligence and kinesthetic aptitude.  This has absolutely nothing to do with her ability to perform; on at least one occasion she has instinctively computed complex four-dimensional intercepts in her head during combat.  In a normal situation even simple mathematics are challenging for her at times.  Honor's problems with mathematics almost resulted in her failing out of Saganami Island.

==In other media==

&lt;/ref&gt; When David Weber was asked which actress he envisioned as Honor Harrington, he replied, "I don’t think there’s anyone out there who has the proper combination of height, physicality, and demonstrated acting ability to be 'perfect' for the role, so my mind is fairly open on this topic." Actress [[Claudia Christian]], who plays [[Susan Ivanova]] on ''[[Babylon 5]]'', has been suggested as a potential candidate; Weber says "She’s much shorter than Honor, but so are most women, and I think she could handle the physicality... I think it’s more important to have someone who can portray Honor’s character and command style than it is to have someone who is six feet two inches tall." Weber's concern is that the director would push Christian to re-create Ivanova's character while playing Honor and "Ivanova’s command style is totally different from Honor’s."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baen.com/intdweber.htm |title=David Weber Internet Interview |first=Toni |last=Weisskopf |date=September 2003 |publisher=Baen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107172709/http://www.baen.com/intdweber.htm |archivedate=2007-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept and creation==
[[David Weber]] didn't set out to create a female protagonist; "it was the way the character came to me," Weber explains. "I didn't set out to do it because I thought that it was especially politically sensitive on my part or because I thought it was likely to strike a chord with female readership or be a financial success. It was just the way that the character first presented herself." Weber doesn't find writing a female character particularly challenging, because, he says, "I'm writing about a human being who happens to be female." When he first started writing, he had developed her entire back story before he started the first book. However, since he knew from the beginning that these books would become a
series, he deliberately set Honor up as a character who changes and grows. One example Weber offers is that in ''[[The Short Victorious War]]'', Honor off-handedly refers to her genetically enhanced metabolism, which isn't fully explored until ''[[In Enemy Hands (novel)|In Enemy Hands]]'': "It was one of those little things that I knew about or that I was holding in reserve," Weber says.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.wildviolet.net/live_steel/david_weber.html |first=Alyce |last= Wilson |title=Interview with David Weber |journal=Wild Violet |volume=6 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first name of his character - Honor - had come to Weber long before the last name did. Weber knew that if the Honor novels worked, she was inevitably going to be compared to [[Cecil Scott Forester|C.S.Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]], therefore he chose Harrington's name so that she had the same initials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfcrowsnest.com/sfnews2/02_july/news0702_1.shtml Interview by Stephen Hunt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124163315/http://www.sfcrowsnest.com/sfnews2/02_july/news0702_1.shtml |date=2009-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He says, "There are certainly, clearly, similarities between the two. There are also huge differences. And Honor has never been as neurotic as Hornblower was. Hornblower always carried a massive sense of inferiority around with him. Honor never did." Weber also feels that in the later books in the series, Honor has more in common with [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Horatio Nelson]] than Hornblower.&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; Weber revealed in the foreword to [[Storm from the Shadows]] that it had originally been his intent to kill Honor off in the [[Battle of Manticore]], thus further mimicking Nelson's life (he died in his greatest battle, [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]]) and have the emerging Mesa problem be dealt with by the next generation, specifically, Honor's children. When writing ''[[At All Costs]]'', he decided instead to keep her alive, and move the Mesan-related events up, to be Honor's problem.

==Parallels to real world history==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2013}}
The Honor Harrington universe shares other parallels with our real history including religious strife, bigotry of many kinds, ignorance and malfeasance and the political situation&amp;mdash;both domestic in both of Honor's governments, but also internationally. During much of Harrington's career, her native [[Star Kingdom of Manticore]] is at war with the neighboring [[People's Republic of Haven]] (PRH), a conflict that has some similarities to the [[Napoleonic Wars]] between the [[British Empire]] and its various alliances during the long struggle to oppose the revolutionaries of [[France]].

Given a faster than light technology and weapons scaled similar to those of the Age of Sail, some of the battles described in the Honor Harrington series resemble real-life sea battles in our historical record. For instance, the long stern chase described in ''[[On Basilisk Station]]'' has some parallels with the actions of [[HMS Kent (1901)|HMS ''Kent'']] at the [[Battle of the Falklands]] during World War I. Similarly, the deathride by Sarnow's battlecruisers in ''[[The Short Victorious War]]'' bears a resemblance to similar manoeuvres by Admiral von Hipper during the [[Battle of Jutland]]. The final actions in ''[[The Honor of the Queen]]'' contain elements from the battles of the [[Battle of the Barents Sea|Barents Sea]] and [[Battle of North Cape|North Cape]] during World War II, as well as the [[Battle of the River Plate]]. The final actions in ''[[Echoes of Honor]]'' are a recreation of the actions of [[Horatio Nelson]] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] except for the stealth in which it was conducted. Further, Weber's choice of interstellar technology forces trade to pursue established trade routes, and creates strategic shipping nexus that are similar to key strategic ports of the days of the [[colonialism|Colonial Era]] when the sailing [[ship of the line]] was king of the sea, and Captains, Admirals and Fleets had to operate out of touch with the home government for months, even years at a time.

'''James Akin''' ({{circa|lk=no|1773}}{{mdash}}1846) was an American political cartoonist and engraver from [[South Carolina]]. He worked in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]]. Associates included former President [[William Henry Harrison]] and [[Jacob Perkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=F.B.

==Skillet incident==
In the early 1800s, Akin worked as an engraver for [[Edmund March Blunt]] in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]]. "In late October 1804 the two men argued publicly, and in the course of the disagreement Blunt threw an iron [[skillet]] at Akin, hitting an unfortunate passerby. Akin, uninjured, retaliated with a deragotory [[Printing|print]] of Blunt entitled 'Infuriated Despondency' and a verse he called 'A Skillet Song.'"&lt;ref&gt;Christina H. Nelson.

Winterthur Portfolio, Vol. 15, No. 2 (Summer, 1980), pp. 93-115 {{jstor|1180534}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caricature was later featured in the [[Newburyport Herald]] in 1805 and in pottery throughout London and [[Liverpool]] in 2006, heaping scorn upon Blunt and his descendants. A few examples still exist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.common-place.org/vol-10/no-02/lessons/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Albert Pike''' (February 14, 1913 – {{circa|September 3–7, 1969}}){{sfn|Armentrout|Slocum|2000|p=401}} was an [[United States|American]] [[Anglicanism|Episcopal]] [[bishop]], prolific writer, and one of the first mainline religious figures to appear regularly on television.

His outspoken, and to some, heretical views on many theological and social issues made him one of the most controversial public figures of his time. He was an early proponent of [[ordination of women]], racial [[desegregation]], and the acceptance of [[LGBT]] people within mainline churches.&lt;ref name="Maudlin 2004"&gt;{{cite web |last=Maudlin |first=Michael G. |year=2004 |title=Be Careful What You Pray For |url=http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2004/august/040830a.html |work=Books &amp; Culture |location=Carol Stream, Illinois |publisher=Christianity Today |access-date=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pike was the fifth [[Episcopal Diocese of California|Bishop of California]]. Late in his life he explored [[psychic]] experimentation in an effort to contact his recently deceased son.

==Early life==
Pike was born in [[Oklahoma City]] on February 14, 1913. His father died when he was two, and his mother married California attorney Claude McFadden. The young Pike was a [[Roman Catholic]] and considered the priesthood; however, while attending the [[University of Santa Clara]] (1930–1932), he came to consider himself an [[agnostic]]. Thereafter, Pike transferred to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], for a year (1932–1933) before transferring again to the [[University of Southern California]], where he received his undergraduate degree in 1934. Subsequently, he earned his [[Bachelor of Laws]] (1936) and [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] (1938) degrees from [[Yale Law School]]. He was admitted to the California bar in 1936. After leaving Yale, he served as a staff attorney for the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] in [[Washington, DC]], during [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] era from 1938 to 1942. He also taught law as a lecturer at the [[Catholic University of America]] (1938–1939) and [[George Washington University]] (1938–1942). In the [[Second World War]], he served with [[Naval Intelligence]].

==Conversion and early church life==
After the Second World War, Pike and his second wife joined the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]. He first entered [[Virginia Theological Seminary]] (1945–1946) and then [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] ([[Bachelor of Divinity]], 1951) to prepare for the priesthood. He was ordained in 1946, first serving as an assistant at St. John's Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square in Washington, DC, before accepting a joint appointment as Rector of Christ Church and [[Episcopalian]] chaplain at [[Vassar College]] in [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. In 1949, he became head of the department of religion and chaplain at [[Columbia University]]. 

Remaining on the adjunct faculty of Columbia, Pike became the Dean of the [[Cathedral of St. John the Divine]] in 1952. Using his new position and media savvy, he vociferously opposed the local Catholic bishops over their attacks on [[Planned Parenthood]] and their opposition to birth control. He accepted an invitation to receive an honorary doctorate from the [[Sewanee: The University of the South|University of the South]] in Tennessee, but then publicly declined after finding that the university did not admit African Americans. An example of Pike's use of the media is how he released his letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'' before it was delivered to Sewanee's trustees: they heard the news when reporters called for reactions.&lt;ref name="Maudlin 2004"/&gt; It was also at this time that he publicly challenged Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s allegation that 7,000 American pastors were part of a Kremlin conspiracy; when the newly elected President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] backed up Pike, McCarthy and his movement began to lose their influence.{{sfn|Robertson|2004|pp=80–81}}

In New York, Pike reached a large audience with liberal sermons and weekly television programs. Common topics included birth control, abortion laws, racism, capital punishment, apartheid, antisemitism, and farm worker exploitation.&lt;ref name="Lampen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lampen |first=Michael |url=http://www.gracecathedral.org/enrichment/crypt/cry_20011114.shtml |title=Bishop James Pike: Visionary or Heretic? |accessdate=March 20, 2007 |work=Tales from the Crypt |publisher=Grace Cathedral |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311165039/http://www.gracecathedral.org/enrichment/crypt/cry_20011114.shtml |archivedate=March 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election as bishop==
Pike was elected as [[coadjutor bishop|bishop coadjutor]] of California in 1958 and succeeded to the see a few months later, following the death of his predecessor, Karl Morgan Block. He served in this position until 1966, when he resigned to become a senior fellow for the [[Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]], a liberal [[think tank]] founded by [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]]. During this period, he was an adjunct professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley, School of Law]] (1966–1967) and the [[Graduate Theological Union]] (1966).

[[File:pike mlk selma 1965.jpg|thumb|left|Pike with [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] at a press conference after [[Selma to Montgomery marches|the march to Selma, Alabama]]]]
His episcopate was marked by both professional and personal controversy. He was one of the leaders of the Protestants and Other Americans United for the Separation of Church and State movement, which advocated against [[John F. Kennedy]]'s presidential campaign because of Catholic teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodward |first=Kenneth L. |date=December 5, 2007 |title=Mitt Romney Is No Jack Kennedy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/opinion/05woodward.html |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A31 |access-date=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at [[Grace Cathedral, San Francisco|Grace Cathedral]], he was involved with promoting a [[living wage]] for workers in [[San Francisco]], the acceptance of [[LGBT]] people in the church, and civil rights.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He also recognized a Methodist minister as having dual ordination and freedom to serve in the diocese.{{sfn|Robertson|2004|pp=101–102}} Later, he ordained a woman as a first-order deacon, now known as a "transitional deacon", usually the first step in the process towards ordination in the priesthood in the Episcopal church.  The ordination was not approved until after Pike's death.{{sfn|Pike|1967}}

Among his notable accomplishments, Pike invited [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] to speak at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco in 1965 following his march to [[Selma, Alabama]].

Pike's theology involved the rejection of central Christian beliefs. His writings questioned a number of widely accepted beliefs, including the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virginity]] of [[Mary, the Mother of Jesus]];&lt;ref name="EDC"/&gt; the doctrine of [[Hell]], and the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref name="EDC"&gt;"Pike, James Albert," ''An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church,'' The Episcopal Church, [https://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/pike-james-albert web version], accessed 9/28/2018&lt;/ref&gt; He famously called for "fewer beliefs, more belief."{{sfn|Pike|1967}} Heresy procedures were begun in 1962, 1964, 1965, and 1966, each growing in intensity, but in the end the Church decided it was not in the denomination's best interest to pursue an actual heresy trial.&lt;ref name="Maudlin 2004"/&gt;

In his personal life, Pike had been a chain-smoker and an alcoholic.{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=126}} His charismatic personality drew many people to him, including Maren Hackett Bergrud, with whom he developed a romantic relationship after the failure of his second marriage in 1965.

==''The Other Side''==
In 1966, Pike's son Jim took his own life in a [[New York City]] hotel room. Shortly after his son's death, Pike reported experiencing [[poltergeist]] phenomena—books vanishing and reappearing, safety pins open and indicating the approximate hour of his son's death, half the clothes in a closet disarranged and heaped up.{{sfn|Christopher|1970}} Pike led a public pursuit of various spiritualist and clairvoyant methods of contacting his deceased son to reconcile. In September 1967, Pike participated in a televised séance with his dead son through the medium [[Arthur Ford (psychic)|Arthur Ford]], an ordained minister in the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ church]]. Pike detailed these experiences in his book ''[[The Other Side (book)|The Other Side]]''.

==Personal==
Pike's first marriage to Jane Alvies was annulled in 1941. He married Esther Yanovsky in 1942; she filed for divorce from Pike in 1965 (finalized in 1966). They had four children, two boys and two girls.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} He lived with, but did not marry, his secretary Maren Bergrud, until 1967, when she committed suicide after they had an argument (he performed the funeral for her in his church). In 1968 he married Diane Kennedy (born 1938), with whom he had collaborated on a book detailing his experience with spiritualism.&lt;ref name="Maudlin 2004"/&gt;

In August 1969, Pike and Diane traveled to Israel, to perform research for a proposed book. On September 2 they drove into the Judean Desert. In preparation for a book on the historical Jesus, they wanted to have a feeling for why Jesus would have gone out into that wilderness to fast and meditate for 40 days. They were unprepared for the journey, having taken along only two Cokes and no water. When their rented car became stuck in a deep rut, the two were not able to extract it (neither knew how to use the car's jack). After an hour of stressful efforts to get the car to move, they decided to walk toward Qumran, where they knew there would be water. What they did not know was that they were far south of Qumran in Wadi Mashash. After two hours of walking in the very hot sun, Pike felt he had to rest. Diane was concerned that, without water, they would both die there so she determined to walk on to find help. After ten long hours of climbing on the walls of the canyon and stumbling along a road under construction, she came upon a camp of Arab laborers. They gave her tea to drink until the foreman came and took her to the nearest army camp. It took four days to find Pike’s body. He had tried to follow his wife and had fallen more than 60 feet down a steep canyon wall where he died. The probable date of his death is September 2; some sources cite it as between September 3 and 7. He was buried in the Protestant cemetery in [[Jaffa]], Israel, on September 8, 1969.

'''Joseph Schlitz''' (May 15, 1831 – May 7, 1875) was a [[German Americans|German-American]] entrepreneur who made his fortune in the brewing industry.

==Early life==
Joseph Schlitz was born on May 15, 1831 in [[Mainz]], [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]]. He emigrated to the U.S. in 1850.  

==Career==
In 1856 he assumed management of the Krug Brewery in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. In 1858 when he married Krug's widow he changed the name of the company to the [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company]]. He became more successful after the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, when he donated hundreds of barrels of beer as part of the relief effort.  Many of Chicago's breweries that had burnt were never to reopen; Schlitz established a distribution point there and acquired a large part of the Chicago market.

==Death==
Schlitz perished along with 340 others in the wreck of the [[SS Schiller|SS ''Schiller'']] in thick fog off the [[Isles of Scilly]] on May 7, 1875. The islands lie 26 miles to the west of Cornwall, [[England]]. Schlitz was returning via New York and Hamburg to visit the country of his birth, Germany. His body was never recovered, but there is a [[cenotaph]] at [[Forest Home Cemetery]], Milwaukee.

==Personal life==
Schlitz was a [[Freemason]] and was affiliated with Aurora Lodge No. 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUo2AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA234&amp;lpg=RA1-PA234&amp;dq=valentin+blatz+freemasons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NDQKeVikw2&amp;sig=KBVGpGJqLsWGxmL3SBjvvOYQSWw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjGnLfyjKPbAhUJS6wKHXaACP4Q6AEwEXoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Grand Lodge of Wisconsin |first= |title=Proceedings of the Most Worshipful Grandlodge at it's 31st Grand Annual Communication |year=1875 |publisher=Burdick &amp; Armitage Printers |location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan Sánchez VillaLobos Ramírez''' is a fictional character in the ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'' film series. He is an [[Immortal (Highlander)|Immortal]].

Ramírez was portrayed by [[Sean Connery]] in ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'' and ''[[Highlander II: The Quickening]]''. These are the only screen appearances of Ramírez, though he is mentioned in ''[[Highlander: The Series]]''.

Other than [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]], Ramírez is the only character that Connery has played in more than one film.

==History==
Ramírez was born '''Tak-Ne''' in [[Egypt]] in 896 BC, and became [[Immortal (Highlander)|Immortal]] after being run down by an out-of-control cart in the streets of his city. The fearful populace, upon learning of this, banished him, and he began to wander the world, encountering many other Immortals, good and evil alike.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Widen, Peter Bellwood, and Larry Ferguson, ''Highlander'' film screenplay (1985); J.T. Krul, ''[[Highlander: Way of the Sword]]'' comic book series (2008), Dynamite Entertainment, Issue #4, pp. 1-5. Ramirez's ancient past is revealed in both sources, including his original Egyptian birth name.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most powerful of all the Immortals on Earth was [[the Kurgan]] ([[Clancy Brown]]), whom Tak Ne battled a number of times throughout early history, including encounters in [[Babylonia]], [[Greece]], and ancient [[China]], including the [[Battle of Plataea]], where he fought under the [[Sparta]]ns, and managed to shatter the Kurgan's blade.&lt;ref&gt;''Highlander'' film screenplay; ''Highlander: Way of the Sword'' comic book series (2008), Issue #3, pp. 2-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Ramírez married three different times, until he finally decided having loved ones was no longer worth the resulting emotional pain of their inevitable deaths. His last wife was Shakiko, a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] princess, whose father, the great [[swordsmith]] [[Masamune]], gave Ramírez a "dragon head" [[katana]] in 592 BC, a sword originally intended for Masamune's adopted, pre-Immortal son, Ren. The resulting grudge would be carried by Ren against Ramírez for the next 2,500 years.&lt;ref&gt;J.T. Krul, ''Highlander: Way of the Sword'' comic book series (2008), Issue #3, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he also trained with the ancient Immortal [[Nakano (Highlander)|Nakano]] (portrayed by [[Mako Iwamatsu]]), from whom he learned the arts of [[metallurgy]].

By 1541, he was living in [[Spain]], working as the Chief Metallurgist to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles V]] under the name Juan Sánchez Villa-Lobos Ramírez. He sought out the Highlander, [[Connor MacLeod]], and took him under his wing, teaching him the rules of the Immortals. Most importantly, he warned him of the Kurgan, who gave him his first death. In 1542, while Connor was away hunting, the Kurgan returned. Though Ramírez had not been his intended victim, the Kurgan was not fussy, and a battle ensued, and while Ramírez nearly managed to decapitate his foe with a neck wound the Kurgan would bear a scar from for the rest of his life, he ultimately lost both the fight and his head. Connor buried Ramírez next to his home in [[Glencoe, Scotland|Glencoe]] and, after his wife Heather ([[Beatie Edney]]) died, he started using his mentor's katana, placing his own [[claymore]] as Heather's grave marker.

==Resurrection==
In 2024 AD, Connor MacLeod ([[Christopher Lambert]]) was an aging old man who had won [[Immortal (Highlander)#The Game and the Prize|The Prize]], killing the Kurgan along the way. He had also learned the origin of the Immortals. They had been exiled from the planet Zeist, becoming Immortals on Earth. The one that had exiled both Ramírez and Connor was the tyrannical ruler of their society, [[General Katana]]. To avoid the risk of MacLeod returning to his world (as was his right for winning 'The Prize'), Katana (portrayed by [[Michael Ironside]]) sent two henchmen, Reno (Peter Bucossi) and Corda (Pete Antico) to kill MacLeod. They failed, which resulted in Connor's rejuvenation through the [[Quickening (Highlander)|Quickenings]] that ensued. Also, during the Quickenings, Connor summoned Ramírez, who was resurrected, now fully aware of his and all of the Immortals' origins. He tracked MacLeod down to [[New York City|New York]], and helped him and [[Louise Marcus]] ([[Virginia Madsen]]) in their fight against Katana and the corrupt Shield Corporation. Ramírez eventually gave his life again to allow Connor and Louise to escape a deadly trap.

==TV series continuity==
Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramírez was referenced in ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'', in that two individuals encountered by [[Duncan MacLeod]] ([[Adrian Paul]]) had also previously known Ramírez. The first was [[Graham Ashe]], an Immortal who had been Ramírez's mentor. The second was Otavio Consone, an Immortal who was one of Ramírez's other students.

==In other media==
* ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' features a parody of ''Highlander'', which is [[fourth wall|also mentioned at the beginning of the skit]] with Ramirez saying, "As you may have noticed, this is a Highlander parody." In place of Connor, he is training [[Lindsay Lohan]] and in place of the Kurgan is [[Hilary Duff]]. He is voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].
* ''[[The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack]]'' episode "Highlandlubber", features a parody of Ramirez partially based on [[Juan Ponce de León|Ponce De Leon]] who is an escaped insane asylum inmate who thinks Captain K'nuckles is a fellow immortal and has him join his mad adventures, the episode concluding with him jumping into a volcano.
*In the book ''[[Ready Player One]]'', the protagonist Parzival introduces himself as Ramirez as a joke while incognito.
*In [[Paradox Development Studio]]'s newest expansion for the computer game ''[[Crusader Kings II]]'', your Immortal ruler can encounter a character named Ramirez, a 1500 year old Spanish-Scotsman who attempts to end your life in personal combat via decapitation.

'''Lorne Saxberg''' (August 6, 1958 – May 6, 2006) was a Canadian television journalist and one of many on-air anchors on [[CBC Newsworld]].
Saxberg was born in [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario and joined the CBC's radio arm.  As host of ''[[Ontario Morning]]'' in the late 1980s, he was known for his keen mind, calm demeanour, and melodious voice.  "He had a full, rich voice not often heard in modern radio," said Canadian freelance broadcaster James Careless, who worked with Saxberg at ''Ontario Morning''. "He was truly a class act both on and off the air."{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Saxberg left ''Ontario Morning'' to become one of the original CBC Newsworld TV anchors from the latter's start in 1989. Saxberg served with the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] for 27 years and was popular with news audiences. He was also an active volunteer with the Canadian Media Guild.

Saxberg received an [[RTNDA Edward R. Murrow Award|Edward R. Murrow Award]] for his work on the 2005 coverage of the 60th anniversary of the atomic bombing of [[Hiroshima]]. Saxberg took a leave of absence from CBC Newsworld to work at Japan's [[NHK]] public broadcaster as a trainer and announcer from 2004.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/05/07/saxberg-obit.html Accident kills CBC broadcaster Lorne Saxberg]. [[CBC News]], May 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in a snorkeling accident in [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], Thailand, where he was on vacation. He was 47 years old.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Ken Becker, a Newsworld producer who worked with Saxberg, said: "He was the consummate pro and an exceptional journalist...When he was in the anchor chair, you knew you could throw Lorne any story – from the outbreak of war to the birth of a panda at the zoo – and he'd deliver it to the viewer with exactly the right tone."

"He brought to every story a vast knowledge on nearly every subject, a reporter's curiosity and an appreciation of fine writing," Becker said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/cbc/s/07052006/3/canada-cbc-broadcaster-lorne-saxberg-dies.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508231020/http://ca.news.yahoo.com/cbc/s/07052006/3/canada-cbc-broadcaster-lorne-saxberg-dies.html |date=May 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once, following a report on the [[Russia]]n precursor of ''[[Naked News]]'', Saxberg began to remove his tie as he ended the newscast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fabmagazine.com/features/294/sadly_missed.html fab Magazine: Feature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Saxberg often returned home to visit his family, who bought a general store in the small town of [[Silver Islet, Ontario|Silver Islet]] in 1987. When home, Saxberg often worked in the store and as the summer resort town's [[harbourmaster]].

In Toronto, however, Saxberg – who was openly gay – was known for being playfully flamboyant with his wardrobe, often wearing a [[snakeskin]] jacket and leather pants when socializing with friends at bars in the [[Church and Wellesley]] area.

'''Louise of Great Britain''' (originally '''Louisa'''; 18 December 1724 – 19 December 1751) was [[List of Danish consorts|Queen of Denmark]] and [[List of Norwegian consorts|Norway]] from 1746 until her death, as the first wife of [[Frederick V of Denmark|King Frederick V]]. She was the youngest surviving daughter of [[King George II of Great Britain]] and [[Caroline of Ansbach]].

==Early years==
Princess Louise was born as the fifth daughter and youngest child of the then Prince and Princess of Wales, on 7 December 1724, at [[Essex House (London)|Leicester House]], [[London]]. She was baptised "Louisa" there on 22 December.&lt;ref name="gaz"/&gt; Her godparents were her elder sister and two cousins: [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain]], Princess [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia]] (for whom [[Sarah Lennox, Duchess of Richmond and Lennox]], stood proxy), and [[Frederick the Great|Frederick, Prince Royal of Prussia]], later Frederick the Great (for whom [[Henry de Nassau d'Auverquerque, 1st Earl of Grantham]], stood proxy).&lt;ref name="gaz"&gt;''[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/6332/pages/1 The London Gazette]'' refers to her as "Princess Louisa"&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Coat_of_Arms_of_Louise_of_Great_Britain.svg|left|thumb|200px|Coat of arms from 30 August 1727]]
On 11 June 1727, when Louise was two years old, her grandfather, [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], died, and her father ascended the throne as George II. On 30 August, as a child of the sovereign, Louise was granted use of the arms of the realm, differenced by a ''label argent of three points, each bearing torteaux gules''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/cadency.htm Marks of Cadency in the British Royal Family]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crown princess===
In a dynastic marriage, Louise wed [[Frederick V of Denmark|Prince Frederick of Denmark and Norway]] on 11 December 1743 in [[Copenhagen]]. A first ceremony was conducted on 10 November 1743 in Hanover with her brother, the Duke of Cumberland, as the representative of the groom.  After this, the entourages of Louise and Frederick met at [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], [[Holstein]], where Louise exchanged her English retinue for a Danish one, headed by her new chamberlain [[Carl Juel]] and her head lady-in-waiting [[Christiane Henriette Louise Juel]].  Louise and Frederick then traveled together to Copenhagen, where they held their official entry into the capital, followed by a second ceremony with the groom present.&lt;ref name="Louise"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/dbl/10/0401.html Louise], page 399, (Dansk biografisk Lexikon / X. Bind. Laale - Løvenørn) (1887-1905) Author: Carl Frederik Bricka&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage was proposed by Great Britain. At the time of the marriage, both France and Great Britain wished to make an alliance with Denmark, and Great Britain had the advantage of being able to make a marriage alliance.&lt;ref name="Louise"/&gt; Frederick's father, [[Christian VI of Denmark|King Christian VI]], hoped the marriage would lead to British support for his or his son's claim to the throne of Sweden.&lt;ref name=B347&gt;Bregnsbo, p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; On a more personal level, there were hopes that marriage would suppress the frequent drinking and debauched behavior of the Crown Prince.&lt;ref name="kvinfo.dk"&gt;[http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/597/bio/1914/origin/170/ Louise], Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple had five children, one of whom did not survive infancy. Although the marriage was arranged, the couple got along quite well, and at least during the first years, their relationship was described as happy.&lt;ref name="kvinfo.dk"/&gt; Frederick was comfortable with her, and Louise pretended not to notice his adultery with multiple partners, notably with [[Else Hansen]]. Though Frederick came to feel high regard for her and always treated her with kindness, however, he reportedly was not in love with her and continued to have affairs after their marriage.&lt;ref name="Louise"/&gt; She quickly made herself popular in the Danish court, and her father-in-law remarked that she seemed to him to be kind and agreeable.&lt;ref name="Louise"/&gt;

==Queenship==
When her husband ascended the throne, on 6 August 1746, as Frederick V, Louise became [[queen consort|Queen]] of Denmark and Queen of Norway.

Queen Louise was very popular in Denmark,&lt;ref name=B347/&gt; and the great popularity of the royal couple has been attributed to Louise.&lt;ref name="kvinfo.dk"/&gt; Interested in [[music]], [[dance]] and [[theatre]], the royal court acquired a more easy-going tone than under her strictly religious parents-in-law. Louise had a vivacious personality, allowing her to socialize easily with others.&lt;ref name=B347/&gt; In 1747, she arranged for the [[Italy|Italian]] [[opera]] company of [[Pietro Mingotti]], whose members included [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] and [[Giuseppe Sarti]], to play at the royal court theater, and in 1748, the French [[Du Londel Troupe]] was invited for dramatic performances.

Her effort to speak the Danish language, including with her children, was much appreciated, as the royal Danish court spoke mostly German.&lt;ref&gt;Bregnsbo, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; She studied the Danish language under the court priest Erik Pontoppidan, and also hired teachers so that her children could learn to speak their country's language.&lt;ref name="kvinfo.dk"/&gt; She was described as well educated and good at conversation, not beautiful but very dignified and well suited to her role as queen. A Swedish diplomat stationed in Denmark described her as follows: 
:"She has good sense and is easy with words, friendly in tone, knows how to converse on many subjects and can speak several languages; while giving court, she seldom leaves anyone without saying something nice; she very much enjoys dance and dances well, she has a good temper and is known for her piety and excellent qualities. She finds pleasure in reading and music, she plays the clavichord well and teaches her daughters to sing."&lt;ref name="Louise"/&gt;

Queen Louise unsuccessfully opposed the dynastic marriage between her daughter Sophia Magdalena and [[Gustav III of Sweden|Crown Prince of Sweden]] in 1751.&lt;ref name="kvinfo.dk"/&gt; The reason was her fear that her daughter would not be well treated by the Queen of Sweden, [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia]]. Louisa Ulrika was known for her anti-Danish views and for being opposed to the match, and it was known that she was the real ruler at the Swedish court.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Ribbing (1958). Gustav III:s hustru. Sofia Magdalena. [The wife of Gustav III. Sofia Magdalena] Stockholm: Alb. Bonniers Boktryckeri.&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Louise also disliked arranged marriages because of her own marriage.

=== Early death ===
[[File:Queen Louise by Pilo.jpg|thumb|150px|The Queen portrayed the year of her death, by court painter [[Carl Gustav Pilo|C.G. Pilo]] ]]
While pregnant with her sixth child, Louise died due to complications from a miscarriage on 19 December 1751, a day after her 27th birthday, at [[Christiansborg Palace]], [[Copenhagen]], predeceasing her husband by fourteen years. She was buried at [[Roskilde Cathedral]].

'''Malik Al-Ashtar''' ({{lang-ar|مالك الأشتر}}) (also known as Malik bin al-Harith al-Nakha'i) was one of the most loyal companions of [[Ali Ibn Abi Talib]], the cousin of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. Malik al-Ashtar became a [[Muslim]] during the time of [[Muhammad]] and since then remained an avid and loyal supporter of Muhammad's progeny and Hashemite clan. He rose to a position of prominence during the [[caliphate]] of [[Ali Ibn Abi Talib]] and participated in several battles, such as the [[Battle of Jamal]] and [[Siffin]].

Malik has been described as a "brave" and "fearless" warrior by numerous Shia sources &lt;ref name="sayedammar"/&gt; and his title ''"al-Ashtar"'' signifies an eyelid injury he received during the [[Battle of Yarmouk]].&lt;ref name="sayedammar"&gt;"Biography of Malik al-Ashtar." N.p., n.d. Web. 27 May 2013. {{cite web |url=http://www.sayedammar.com/ARBAEEN%202011/arbaeen2011poppa.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203070212/http://www.sayedammar.com/ARBAEEN%202011/arbaeen2011poppa.html |archivedate=2012-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth==
Although Malik's actual birth year is not known, many historians say that he was 10 years older than [[Ali Ibn Abi Talib]] and 20 years younger than [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Ashtar-bio"&gt;Nakshawani, Ammar "Biography of Malik al-Ashtar." N.p., n.d. Web. 27 May 2013. {{cite web |url=http://www.sayedammar.com/ARBAEEN%202011/arbaeen2011poppa.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203070212/http://www.sayedammar.com/ARBAEEN%202011/arbaeen2011poppa.html |archivedate=2012-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is known that Malik was a [[Madh'hij]], a sub-class of the Bani Nakha tribe from [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="Sermons, Letters, Sayings"&gt;Ibn Abi Talib, Ali. Nahjul Balagha = Peak of Eloquence : Sermons, Letters, and Sayings of Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib. Ed. Mohammad Askari. Jafery. Elmhurst, NY: Tahrike Tarsile Quran, 1984. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; which is also the tribe of another Sahabah named [[Amru bin Ma'adi Yakrib]]

His lineage is traced back to Yarab bin Qahtan which genealogy can be traced by sorting his paternal surname Malik bin Al Hareth bin Abed Yaghouth bin Salamah bin Rabha bin Al Harith bin Jathima bin Malik bin Al Naghe bin Amro bin Alaae bin Khald bin Mathgah bin Addad bin Zayd bin Urayb bin Zayd bin Kahlan bin Saba al Akbar bin Youshgab bin Yarab

==Conflicts with the governor of Kufa and the event of Al-Rabathah==
In the year 30 AH (after [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]) or 650 CE, many Muslims living in the city of [[Kufa]] were angered over the action of the governor [[Walid ibn Uqba|Waleed ibn Uqba]] (the half brother of [[Uthman ibn Affan]]).&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"&gt;Sayyid, Kamāl, and Jasim Alyawy. Malik al-Ashtar. [Qum, Iran]: Ansariyan Foundation, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Waleed ibn Uqba was disliked and was a very controversial figure because of his actions. Even the Quran (sure 49 verse 6), exposes his character by stating that he is an evil man.&lt;ref&gt;Nakshawani, Ammar. "Biography of Kumayl Ibn Ziyad Al Nakhai - Dr Sayed Ammar Nakshawani." YouTube. Masjid Al Husayn Leicester, 21 Nov. 2012. Web. 01 July 2013. &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSxmk_yIrbc&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Muhammad described him as a [[Fasiq]] (open sinner).&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Nakha'i-bio"&gt;Nakshawani, Ammar. "Biography of Kumayl Ibn Ziyad al-Nakha'i." [[YouTube]]. Masjid Al Husayn Leicester, 21 Nov. 2012. Web. 01 July 2013. &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSxmk_yIrbc&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; He (Muhammad) said, "He is an open sinner (Fasiq), get him out of the Islamic state."&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Nakha'i-bio"/&gt; He was known to be an alcoholic who publicly consumed alcohol and was disliked because Islam prohibits the consumption of alcohol. The tipping point came when al-Waleed entered the [[mosque]] drunk to lead [[Fajr]] [[Namaz]] (morning prayer). He was so intoxicated that he read four [[Raka'at]]s.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Nakha'i-bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;Nakshawani, Ammar. "Biography of Malik al-Ahstar." Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], a 13th-century Sunni Islamic scholar stated, "The [[Sahaba|Companions]] would pray behind people whom they knew to be open transgressors, such as when [[Abd-Allah ibn Mas'ud]] and other companions would pray behind Walid ibn 'Uqba ibn Abi Mu'it, who may have recently drunken alcohol (when he was praying) and would wind up praying four rakaats." However, Fajr namaz (morning prayer) is only two raka'ats. At the end of his fourth raka'at, al-Waleed turned around and asked the people if he should continue the prayer.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Nakha'i-bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; This event enraged many Muslim citizens. They started to criticize him in markets, houses, and mosques. Furthermore, they started to question the leadership and judgement of Uthman bin Affan. Because clearly to them al-Waleed was violating the teachings of Islam and the rights of the Muslims. Thus, Malik al-Ashtar addressed the concerned Muslims by saying "First we'd better advise him. Then we'll tell the Caliph about his bad behavior."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; So, Malik al-Ashtar and a group of ten people, one of whom was Kumayl ibn Ziyad, went to the palace of al-Waleed to address the issues they were having with him.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Nakha'i-bio"/&gt; However, they found him drinking alcohol.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; The delegation told him to behave in a proper manner, he scolded them, told them to leave and exiled them to Shaam (modern day [[Damascus, Syria]]).&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Nakha'i-bio"/&gt; When the delegation of men reached Shaam, they addressed the issue to [[Mu'awiyah]], who was the governor.

{{quote|
After listening to the issues, Mu'awiyah told Kumayl "How dare you speak you speak ill about the person in Kufa. How dare you disunite the religion of Allah." 

Kumayl replied "Its that man (referring to al-Waleed) who is disuniting. And Allah tells us to be beware of corrupt rulers."

Mu'awiyah replied, "The Quran says obey Allah, obey the prophet, and obey the leaders from amongst you. I am from the leaders amongst you." 

Kumayl replied, "You're not my leader and nothing to do with my leader. My leader is someone else :Mu'awiyah then told him and the delegation "Very well, you been exiled from Kufa. I'll exile you and Malik al-Ashtar from Shaam as well."&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Nakha'i-bio"/&gt;}}

They were exiled them from Shaam to [[Homs]].&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Nakha'i-bio"/&gt; But eventually, Malik al-Ashtar, Kumayl ibn Ziyad, and the delegation made it back to Kufa.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Nakha'i-bio"/&gt; After coming back to Kufa and failing to remove al-Waleed, the delegation of Muslims (one of whom was Kumayl ibn Ziyad) led by Malik al-Ashtar set off on a journey to [[Medina|Madina]], the capital of the Muslim empire, to address the issue with Uthman.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Nakha'i-bio"/&gt; Kumayl ibn Ziyad, Malik al-Ashtar, [[Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhaifa]], and Abdur Rahman ibn Udays were the ones who spoke out most about al-Waleed and the corruption that was occurring.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Nakha'i-bio"/&gt;

=== The event of al-Rabathan ===
On their way to Madina, Malik al-Ashtar and the delegation stopped at al-Rabathan to visit [[Abu Dharr al-Ghifari]]. Abu Dharr, who was a companion of Muhammad and firm supporter and companion of Ali, was banished to die in the desert of Al-Rabathan. At the time, 650 a.d, Abu Dharr's health was deteriorating. Narrations state that his wife would cry, seeing her husband slowly die in the desert. However, Abu Dharr told her the prophecy of his death, which was given to him by none other than Muhammad, messenger of God. He would say, "One day, my friends and I was sitting with Allah's Apostle (Muhammad). And he said to us: One of you will die in the desert. And a group of believers will attend his death. All my friends passed away in their houses. And no one has remained but I. A person will come to your aid."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; His wife then stated, "The time of [[Hajj]] (Pilgrimage) is over. And no one has passed through this desert."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Abu Dharr then told her "Don't worry! Go up the hill and look at the road of caravans."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; So she went and eventually saw a caravan coming towards her. When she saw the caravan, she started to wave a piece of cloth to get the attention of the on coming caravan. When the caravan approached her she started a conversation. 

{{quote|"My husband is dying. And no one is beside him."

The caravan men: "And who's your husband?"

"Abu Dharr, the companion of Allah's Apostle!"

The caravan men were surprised. So, they said: "Abu Dhar! The Prophet's companion! Come on! Let's see him!"

The men went to the tent. When they came into it, they saw Abu Dhar sleeping in his bed. They said: "Assalamu Alaik, companion of Allah's Apostle!"

Abu Dharr: "Wa Alaikum al-Salam, who are you?"

One of the men said: "Malik bin al-Haarth al-Ashtar. And there are some men with me from Iraq. We're going to Madina to tell the Caliph about the persecution we suffer from."

Abu Dharr: "My brothers, be cheerfull! Allah's Apostle [s] has told me that I'll die in the desert and that some believers will attend my death."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt;}}

Malik and the delegation then sat next to Abu Dhurr. They felt sorrow to see one of the great companions of the prophet in bad condition. Malik told Abu Dhurr that they were on their way to Medina to meet with Uthman over the issue of al-Waleed. Upon hearing the news of al-Waleed, Abu Dhur became sad.

After the event of al-Rabathah, Malik and the delegation continued on their long journey to Medina. When finally met Uthman, they communicated their concerns and al-Waleed's behaviors to Uthman. However they were unsuccessful in their mission thus they decided to seek Hazrat Ali's help.

==The downfall of Uthman and Malik's resolution==
Since Uthman denied to hear the concerns about al-Waleed, the delegation of concerned Muslims went to the house of Ali in Medina. They told Ali the situation with al-Waleed and Uthman.  Ali was sad to hear the news. However, he assured them that he would visit Uthman personally regarding this issue. In his meeting with Uthman, Ali said "Uthman, the Muslims are complaining of the rulers' persecution. And you know that very well I've heard Allah's Apostle (Muhammad) saying: On the Day of Judgement, the unjust imam will be brought to hell. And no one will support or excuse him. Then, he will be thrown into hell. He'll go round and round it till he gets into its intense heat."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; This statement made Uthman realize his mistakes. And as a result, Uthman promised to seek God's forgiveness and apologize to the Muslims. However, [[Marwan I|Marwan bin al-Hakam]], the cousin of Uthman, persuaded Uthman not to do so by saying "You'd better threaten the people so as no one would dare to say bad words against the Caliph (Uthman)."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Due to Marwan, Uthman broke his promise and became stricter. It is documented that he hit the noble companion [[Ammar ibn Yasir]] and whipped the companion Abdullah bin Masoud.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; The stricter policies caused an uproar in the Muslim empire; people began writing letter such as the following below.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Muslims, come to us. And save the Caliphate. Allah's Book has been changed. And the Prophet's Sunnah has been changed. So, come to us if you believe in Allah and the Day of Judgement.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a true democratic matter, Malik al-Ashtar represented the enraged Muslim in a meeting with Uthman. In the meeting, Malik asked Uthman to step down from power, but Uthman refused. Uthman's refusal to step down only led to increasing problems. Ali tried to help Uthman and resolve the issue. He sent his own two sons, [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Hussein ibn Ali]] to go to Uthman and protect him from the angry protesters.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; Despite this, protesters broke into Uthman's room and killed him. After the killing of Uthman, many Muslims went to Ali and asked him to become the new [[caliph]] (leader). But he refused, but Malik and others insisted that he become the caliph. To which Malik addresses, "People, this is the Prophet's Regent. He has learnt the Prophet's knowledge. Allah's Book has mentioned his belief. Allah's Apostle [s] has told him that he will enter al-Ridhwan Garden. His personality is perfect The people in the past and present are certain of his behaviour and knowledge."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Malik was one of the first to appoint Ali as the new caliph.

==Battle of Jamal==
{{Main|Battle of Jamal}}
[[File:Mousoleum Malik Al-Ashtar .jpg|thumb|right|Mausoleum of Malik Al-Ashtar]]
After the downfall of Uthman, many Muslims wanted to gain power within the Islamic Empire. However, Ali was appointed as the new caliph. This upset power-hungry Muslims and the enemies of Ali.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; As a result, they planned to launch an offensive in the year 656 AD to fight against Ali under the claim that they wanted revenge for the killing of Uthman.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; One of these was [[Marwan I|Marwan al Hakim]], who would later become a loyal supporter of [[Mu'awiyah]]. Marwan played a key role in the Battle of Jamal, in that he formed a large army to fight against Ali.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; He also bankrolled the army with money that he had stolen from the Public Treasury (money which was supposed to be for Muslim citizens) during the time of Uthman.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; The army included Aisha, Talha (a friend of Ali), Zubair (the cousin of Ali), and Marwan.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Once the army was formed, the rebels headed to [[Basrah]], Iraq. When Ali got news that a mutiny was going to occur, he also formed an army to combat the rebel forces. During the mutiny, the new governor of Kufa, Abu Musa al-Ashary, encouraged the Kufains (citizens of Kufa) not to join Ali's army.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Additionally, he encouraged the people to distance themselves and disobey the new caliph, Ali. When Ali realized the situation in Kufa, he sent Malik al-Ashter to rally up troops.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Ashtar-bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; As a firm and loyal supporter of Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Malik rallied up the Kufian (citizens of [[Kufa]]) with a powerful speech. In the meantime, Abu Musa al-Ashary was commanding people to stay in their homes and not fight for Ali.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Malik understood that he needed to remove Abu Musa al-Ashary. So Malik and a large group of fighters seized the palace.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Luckily, Abu Musa al-Ashary was at the mosque.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; His guards informed him that Malik al-Ashtar and a large number of fighters had taken control of the palace.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Since Abu Musa al-Ashary was not capable of fighting off Malik, he surrendered.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; And asked Malik to give him a day to leave Kufa.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Malik accepted his offer and let Abu Musa al-Ashary leave peacefully. Once Abu Musa al-Ashary left, Malik delivered another powerful speech (in the mosque) that captivated the hearts of the Kufains. The speech successfully aroused more than 18,000 soldier to join him in order to defend against the rebel attack.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; 9,000 of those troops were under Malik's commands and the other 9,000 were under [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] (the eldest son of Ali) commands.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; They quickly headed towards Dhiqaar, Iraq to join Ali's army.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; On the day of the [[Battle of Camel]], Ali Ibn Abi Talib put Malik al-Ashtar in charge of the right wing of his army, [[Ammar ibn Yasir]] in charge of the left wing of his army, and gave the flag to his son [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah]].&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; After both sides introduced themselves (Arabian custom/tradition), Ali asked his army not to attack because they might be mistaken.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Ashtar-bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; He also asked his army is there is a brave soul who can take the Quran and appeal to them (the rebels).&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Ashtar-bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; A brave young man told Ali that he is willing to do it. When the young man turned towards the rebels, the rebels killed him. After this, Ali raised his hands towards the sky and prayed "Allah, the eyes are gazing at you! And the hands are extended! Our lord, judge between our nation and us with justice! And you're the best judge!"&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; When he finished, the war began. Malik al-Ashtar and his soldiers advanced fighting bravely. During the war, Ali Ibn Abi Talib told Malik that as long as the camel of Aisha is standing the war will continue. In order, to end the war he orders Malik al-Ashtar to cut the feet of the Aisha's camel.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; In addition, he orders [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]], the blood brother of Aisha, to catch Aisha when she falls of the camel.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; Both Malik and Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr carried out their assignments, thus ending the battle.&lt;ref name="Nakshawani-al-Ashtar-bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Above all, Ali ordered his soldiers to escort Aisha safely back to Medina, release the prisoners of war, and cure the injured rebels. Moreover, he forgave/pardoned all the rebels for their actions.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; However, after the war, Malik al-Ashtar and Ammar bin Yasir went to Aisha. Many scholars state that Malik was 70 years old in the Battle of Jamal.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; Overall, Malik al-Ahstar was the main cavalry and commander of the army of Ali Ibn Abi Talib in the [[Battle of Jamal]] (Battle of the Camel).

==Battle of Siffeen==
{{Main|Battle of Siffeen}}

=== Battles over the Euphrates River ===
Although the minor conflict occurred in Kirkeesya, the war took place at Siffeen (on the banks of the Euphrates) when Mu'awiyah headed a large reinforcing army to join Abi al-Awar al-Salmy and his army (Mu'awiyah's first army that attacked at night).&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Mu'awiyah brought reinforcements because during the minor conflict many of his soldiers were killed and injured. When they got to Siffeen, [[Mu'awiyah]] ordered an offensive to his army to gain control of the [[Euphrates]] River.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; By taking the controlling the water, Mu'awiyah violated an Islamic law and the laws of war.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Therefore, Ali sent Sasaah bin Suhan, one of the companions of the Prophet, to ask for some water.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; He states to Mu'awiyah, "Mu'awiyah, Ali says: Let us take some water. Then we'll decide what's between you and us, otherwise we will fight each other till the victor drinks."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Mu'awiyah replied "I'll answer you later on."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; After Sasaah bin Suhan left, Mu'awiyah sought advice from his trusted men about what he should do about the water situation. Al-Waleed bin Uthbah (the ex-governor of Kufa, which the Quran calls a [[Fasiq]] Sura 49 Verse 6) advised Mu'awiyah to "Prevent them from drinking water to force them to surrender."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Mu'awiyah and the other men agreed. Over the course of time, Malik watched the military supply and movements taking place on the river banks. He then realized that Mu'awiyah is tightening the siege of the Euphrates River.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; During the course of war, the soldier in the army of Ali Ibn Abi Talib became thirsty due to the physical exertion and blistering heat. Even Malik himself became thirsty. To which a man came up to Malik and said "There's only little water in my water-skin, please drink it."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; But Malik refused and told him "I won't drink till all soldiers drink!"&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Noticing that most of the soldiers were thirsty, Malik went to Ali and said "Amirul Mu'mineen, our soldiers are very thirsty. We've nothing but fighting."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; So Ali Ibn Abi Talib wrote a letter to Muawiyah asking for water.&lt;ref name="sayedammar"/&gt; However, Mu'awiyah denied giving Ali Ibn Abi Talib's soldiers water.&lt;ref name="sayedammar"/&gt; Once again, Malik al-Ashtar plays a huge role for the army of Ali Ibn Abi Talib . Ali Ibn Abi Talib calls Malik and asks him to lead his soldiers in an attack to gain possession of the Euphrates River.&lt;ref name="sayedammar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Malik and his men fight valiantly and won back the possession of the Euphrates river. The following day, an arrow with a letter attached was shot at Ali's army.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Soldiers read the letter which said "From a loyal brother in the Shamian Army, Mu'awiyah is going to open the river to drown you. So, be careful!" and passed the news around.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; This news caused the soldiers to withdraw from the banks of the Euphrates River. Mu'awiyah noticed this and decided to recapture the river for his army.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Yet again,  Ali sends his soldiers to fight of Mu'awiyah's troops and gain control of the river. At this point, Mu'awiyah became worried that now Ali won't allow them to drink water from the river. He even ask Amr ibn al-As, "Do you think Ali will prevent us from drinking water?"&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; To which Amr replied, "Ali doesn't do as you do!"&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Ironically, Mu'awiyah's writes a letter to Ali Ibn Abi Talib asking him for water since his (Mu'awiyah) soldiers were now thirsty. Ali Ibn Abi Talib grants Mu'awiyah and his soldiers permission to drink water from the Euphrates River.&lt;ref name="sayedammar"/&gt;  Allowing the rebels to drink water changed the mindset of some people in Mu'awiyah's army. They reflected upon both Mu'awiyah and Ali. And realized that Mu'awiyah did everything and anything including breaking Islamic laws to win the war.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Whereas, Ali did everything to represent the true Islam even if it meant losing the war. And at nighttime, some of Mu'awiyah's troops went and joined Ali's army because they represented the truth and humanity.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt;

=== Malik's discipline and the end of the war ===
As the battle continued, Malik al-Ashtar fought his way through the opposing army until he was two rows away from Mu'awiyah's tent.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; Only two rows away from killing Mu'awiyah and ending the war. However, a situation occurred. Mu'awiyah wanted to trick Ali's army to stop fighting and disunite them by creating confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Malik Al-Ashtar. [Qum, Iran]: Ansariyan Foundation, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Mu'awiyah loved the idea and ordered his soldiers to place the Quran on their spear.&lt;ref name="sayedammar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; When most of the soldiers of Ali saw this they stopped fighting. Though Ali knew that it was a trick by Mu'awiyah to create confusion and disunity, he told his army "It's a trick! I was the first to invite them to Allah's Book. And I was the first to believe in it. They've disobeyed Allah and broken His promise." (this is referring to the negotiation/persuading process before the war)&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Ali wanted his soldier to continue fighting because they were so close to victory. Despite Ali's effort, 22,000 soldiers dsobeyed his commands and said "Stop fighting and order al-Ashtar to withdraw!"&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Knowing that his own soldiers had turned their backs on him and a few group of true believers, Ali Ibn Abi Talib told his soldiers to command Malik to return for safety reasons.&lt;ref name="sayedammar"/&gt; The messenger gave Malik the order. Even though, Malik knew that he has the opportunity to end the war and rid the world of Ma'uwiyah, he stopped and returned.&lt;ref name="sayedammar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Malik said "If Ali ibn Abi Talib orders something, I have to return".&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

=== The arbitration ===
They ceased fighting and agreed to an arbitration according to the Quran. Mu'awiyah chose Amr ibn al-As to represent him and Ali chose Abdullah bin Abbas (because he was a wise man who had a good knowledge of the Quran).&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; But the rebel did not agree to Abdullah bin Abbas and told Ali to pick Abu Musa al-Ashary (because Abu Musa was not really a firm supporter of Ali therefore the rebels could get an upper hand in the arbitration).&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Ali replied to them saying "I disagree with you on him. And Abdullah bin Abbas is better than he (Abu Musa)."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; But the rebels again denied. Ali then chose Malik al-Ashtar to represent him. Once again, the rebels refused and insisted for Abu Musa.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; To avoid further chaos/conflict, Ali told them "Do whatever you like!"&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; As a result, Amr ibn al-As and Abu Musa entered the arbitration. Knowing that Abu Musa was not a firm supporter of Ali, Amr ibn al-As deceived Abu Musa by saying "Abu Musa, Mu'awiyah and Ali have caused all these troubles. So, lets dispose them and elect another man."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Abu Musa took the bait and stated "I'm removing Ali from the caliphate as I'm removing my ring from my finger.",&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; then he removed his ring. Afterwards, Amr ibn al-As said "I'm fixing Mu'awwiyah to the caliphate as I'm fixing my ring to my finger.",&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; then he wore his ring. The trick worked but Ali still had control of the caliphate. Both sides did agree to a truce and a year of peace.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Ali commanded his soldiers not to fight for a year, but a large group (who developed their own beliefs of "La Hukma Illa Lillah", meaning, "no rulership except by Allah alone.") broke away from Ali and disobeyed the agreement/orders.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; They became known as the [[Khawarij]] and fought Ali in the [[Battle of Nahrawan]].

==Becoming governor of Egypt==
At the time, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was the governor of Egypt. [[Amr ibn al-As]], one of Mu'awiyah's companions, wanted to become the governor of Egypt.&lt;ref name="sayedammar"/&gt; So he rallied 6,000 soldiers and headed towards Egypt.&lt;ref name="sayedammar"/&gt; After finding out about the possible overthrow, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr wrote to Ali Ibn Abi Talib asking for help and support. Ali Ibn Abi Talib wrote back assuring Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, son of the first caliph and then Ali's adopted son, that he is sending his best [[general]] and one of his closest companions, Malik al-Ashtar. Ali then told Malik: "Malik, may Allah have mercy on you, go to Egypt. I have absolute trust in you. Rely on Allah! Use gentleness in its place and intensity in its place."&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt;

Muhammad ibn Abū-Bakr was instructed to return to ʻAlī's capital city, Kufa. Malik Al-Ashtar was appointed [[Governor]] of [[Egypt]] in 658 (38 A.H.) by Alī ibn Abī-Tālib, the caliph of the Muslims, after the [[Battle of Siffin]] had ended.

==Alleged assassination plot by Muawiyah==
According to Shia tradition, when Mu'awiyah received the news that Ali appointed Malik al-Ashtar as the new governor of Egypt, he was overwhelmed with worry.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Knowing that al-Ashtar was of ferocious built and strength, Muawiyah is said to have formulated a plot to assassinate him using poison imported from Rome and sent a delegate with the poison to a certain man owning vast lands in al-Qilzim City (a service station/resting spot for travelers) on the borders of Egypt, requesting that he poison al-Ashtar in exchange for lifelong tax exemption. The man is said to have agreed to the envoy's request.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt;

==Death==
On the way to Egypt, Malik al-Ashtar decided to stop at al-Qilzim. Upon his arrival, the man (who agreed to poison Malik) invited Malik, the new governor of Egypt, for lunch at his house.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Malik humbly accepted the man's invitation without knowing that he was going to kill him by [[Muawiyah I]] on a suggestion of [['Amr ibn al-'As]]. They went to his home to have lunch. The man placed the poisoned honey in a cup and placed it on the table.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; Malik took a spoonful of the poisoned honey.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; When Malik consumed the honey, the poison spread rapidly throughout his body. Malik realized that he was poisoned as soon as he felt pain in his stomach. After realizing that he was poisoned, Malik placed his hand on his stomach and said "In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. We belong to Allah, and we'll come back to Him!"&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Foundation"/&gt; The poison was so destructive and toxic that within moments Malik al-Ashtar died. Muawiyah is said to have rejoiced upon hearing of al-Ashtar's death.&lt;ref name="sayedammar"/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Descendants===
Malik had two sons, the first was named Ishaq (Isaac) and the other was named Ibrahim (Abraham).&lt;ref name="sayedammar"/&gt; Ishaq was a phenomenal warrior who supported and valiantly gave his life to protect [[Hussain ibn Ali]], the son of Ali, in the [[Battle of Karbala]]. After [[Habib ibn Muzahir]], Ishaq killed the most enemy fighters.&lt;ref name="sayedammar"/&gt; On the other hand, [[Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar|Ibrahim ibn Malik al-Ashtar]], the son of Malik al-Ashtar, along with [[Mukhtar al-Thaqafi]] rose against the killers of [[Hussain ibn Ali]].&lt;ref name="sayedammar"/&gt; The two killed most of the killers of Hussain and his army. For example, they caught and killed [[Umar ibn Sa'ad]], [[Shimr ibn Thil-Jawshan]], Sanan ibn Anas, [[Hurmala|Hurmala ibn Kahil]] and Ubaidullah Ibn Ziyad (these were [[Yazid I]]'s soldiers who fought against Hussain).&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

Among his descendants are the Kalbasi family, who reside in Iran and some reside in Iraq.  One branch of this family adds the title "Ashtari" to the end of their family name to denote this fact. 
In Lebanon, the Hamadani family from the southern town of Nabatieh are also direct descendants who have maintained a family tree dating back to the Nakha'i tribe origins. The Mroueh family, after tracing their lineage, are also believed to be descendants. The Malek (or Malekian) family, from Mazandaran (Iran), are also believed to be descendants.

{{Criminal law}}

'''Misdemeanor murder''' is a situation in which a person is suspected of murder, but there is not enough evidence to convict the suspect of murder in court. The suspect is then either released without charges or the suspect receives a sentence that is similar to a sentence given to a person charged with a misdemeanor.

==Florida==

In a 2001 article, the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' reported a drifter convicted of murder fifteen years ago had his conviction overturned.  The original sentence was based on [[circumstantial evidence]]. The reporter refers to the original case as the kind lawyers call a "misdemeanor murder" due to lack of sympathy for the victim who was a teenage crack addict and prostitute, but, in this case, the suspect was imprisoned based on circumstantial evidence and false testimony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oranous.com/innocence/RudolphHolton/newtrial.htm Man on death row gets new trial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202121420/http://www.oranous.com/innocence/RudolphHolton/newtrial.htm |date=2008-12-02 }} David Karp, St. Petersburg Times, 2001-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;

==Louisiana==

[[New Orleans]] is often accused of institutionalized "misdemeanor murder". Article 701 of the criminal code requires the state to release a defendant who has not been charged with a crime after 60 days.&lt;ref name="Geaux"&gt;[http://donotpassgeaux.blogspot.com/2007/04/misdemeanor-murder.html Misdemeanor Murder] Do Not Pass Geaux, 2007-04-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,,2206215,00.html New Orleans murder rate for year will set record] Ethan Brown, Guardian Unlimited, 2007-11-06&lt;/ref&gt;  Before [[Hurricane Katrina]] a few hundred people per year were released under article 701.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;  In 2006, after Katrina, there were over 3,000 article 701 releases although the population had dropped from around 500,000 to around 250,000.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Causes include inexperienced prosecutors, inexperienced police officers, poor processing procedures, poor tracking procedures, incomplete reports, missing evidence and an undermanned police force.&lt;ref name="Geaux" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;
New Orleans also has a problem with witnesses that go missing before trial and a crime lab that was destroyed during Katrina and ({{as of|2011|November|lc=y}}) has yet to be repaired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/base/news-7/11712631133140.xml&amp;coll=1 Crime thrives under 60-day rule] Gwen Filosa, The Times-Picayune, 2007-02-12&lt;/ref&gt;  All of this results in an effective sentence of 60 days for those suspected of murder.

==Texas==

In East [[Texas]], criminal defense attorney, [[Percy Foreman]] (1902-1988) made a career out of "defending thieves, murderers, and wayward spouses". He had an impressive record among those charged with committing capital offenses, which he called "misdemeanor murder". Out of nearly 1,500 men and women facing the death sentence, he lost only one to execution.  A Texas legislator once said, "Nobody who has the money to hire Percy Foreman has any real fear of the death penalty."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easttexashistorical.org/programs/gone/foreman.html Percy Foreman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120214555/http://www.easttexashistorical.org/programs/gone/foreman.html |date=2008-11-20 }} Michael Dorman, King of the Courtroom: Percy Foreman for the Defense (New York, 1969), via the East Texas Historical Association, accessed 2007-12-06&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' found that at least 120 times from 2000 through 2006 probation was given instead of a sentence of murder.  In [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] twice as many murderers were put on [[probation]] as were sent to [[death row]]. Forty-seven people or nine percent in the county were placed on probation instead of in prison for murder.  Most of these murder-probations are given to minorities who murder minorities, especially when the victim had engaged in illegal or immoral activity and when the victim has no relatives or friends. Defense [[lawyer]]s are able to reduce sympathy for the victim.  If the defense lawyer can then induce sympathy for the [[defendant]], a plea bargain will result.  This process is aided by the [[jury]] system used in Texas, as juries can be easier to persuade than judges.  Prosecutors cooperate in order to reduce caseload, knowing the suspects will most likely violate probation making them easier to prosecute later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/longterm/stories/111107dnproujday1main.e07b32.html Unequal Justice: Murderers on Probation] Brooks Egerton and Reese Dunklin, The Dallas Morning News, 2007-11-10&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Mgen still has the smallest genome of any known (naturally occurring) self-replicating organism and thus is often the organism of choice in minimal-genome research.

The [[synthetic genome]] of Mgen named ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' JCVI-1.0 (after the research centre, [[J. Craig Venter Institute]], where it was synthesised) was produced in 2008, becoming the first organism with a synthetic genome.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Infection with Mgen produces a combination of clinical symptoms, but can be [[asymptomatic]]. It causes [[inflammation]] in the [[urethra]] ([[urethritis]]) both in men and women, which is associated with [[mucopurulent discharge]] in the [[Urinary system|urinary tract]], and [[Dysuria|burning while urinating]]. In women, it causes [[cervicitis]] and [[pelvic inflammatory disease|pelvic inflammatory diseases (PID)]], including [[endometritis]] and [[salpingitis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women may also experience bleeding after sex and it is also linked with [[infertility|tubal factor infertility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manhart|first1=Lisa E.|title=''Mycoplasma genitalium'': An emergent sexually transmitted disease?|journal=Infectious Disease Clinics of North America|year=2013|volume=27|issue=4|pages=779–792|doi=10.1016/j.idc.2013.08.003|pmid=24275270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/944920918|title=Williams gynecology|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Schorge, John O.,, Hoffman, Barbara L.,, Bradshaw, Karen D.,, Halvorson, Lisa M.,, Schaffer, Joseph I.,, Corton, Marlene M.,|year=|isbn=9780071849081|edition= Third |location=New York|pages=65|oclc=944920918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For men, the most common signs are painful urination or a watery discharge from the penis.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/health/what-to-know-std-mg/index.html|title=What you should know about this 'new' STD - CNN|first=Kristine Thomason,|last=Health.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polymerase chain reaction]] analyses indicated that it is a cause of acute [[non-gonococcal urethritis]] (NGU) and probably chronic NGU.

==Pathophysiology==
There is a consistent association of ''M. genitalium'' infection and female reproductive tract syndromes. ''M. genitalium'' infection was significantly associated with increased risk of preterm birth, spontaneous abortion, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Infertility risk is also strongly associated with infection with ''M. genitalium'', although evidence suggests it is not associated with male infertility.&lt;ref name="pmid26311339"&gt;

The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] has one specific recommended regimen with [[azithromycin]] and another specific recommended regimen with [[doxycycline]].&lt;ref name=CdcUandC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/urethritis-and-cervicitis.htm|title=CDC - Diseases Characterized by Urethritis and Cervicitis - 2010 STD Treatment Guidelines|website=www.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; As alternative regimens, the agency has specific regimens each with [[erythromycin]] or [[erythromycin ethylsuccinate]] or [[ofloxacin]] or [[levofloxacin]].&lt;ref name=CdcUandC/&gt;

== Clinical diagnostics ==
Recent research shows that prevalence of Mgen is currently higher than other commonly occurring STIs ([[Sexually transmitted infection|Sexually Transmitted Infections]]).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor-Robinson D, Jensen JS. Mycoplasma genitalium: from chrysalis to multicolored butterfly. Clin Microbiol Rev. 2011;24(3):498–514&lt;/ref&gt; Mgen is a fastidious organism with prolonged growth durations. This makes detection of the pathogen in clinical specimens and subsequent isolation, extremely difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, J. S., Hansen, H. T. &amp; Lind, K.

According to the European guidelines, the indication for commencement of diagnosis for Mgen infection are:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Jensen, M Cusini, M Gomberg. 2016 European guideline on Mycoplasma genitalium infections&lt;/ref&gt;

#Detection of nucleic acid (DNA and/or RNA) specific for Mgen in a clinical specimen
#Current partners of individuals who tested positive for Mgen should be treated with the same antimicrobial as the [[index patient]]
#If current partner does not attend for evaluation and testing, treatment with the same regimen as given to the index patient should be offered on [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] grounds
#On epidemiological grounds for sexual contacts in the previous 3 months; ideally, specimens for a Mgen NAAT should be collected before treatment and treatment should not be given before the result are available

Screening for Mgen with a combination of detection and macrolide resistance mutations will provide the adequate information required to develop personalised antimicrobial treatments, in order to optimise patient management and control the spread of [[antimicrobial resistance]] (AMR).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Tabrizi SN et al.

=== Detection of resistance ===
Owing to the widespread [[Macrolide|macrolide resistance]], samples that are positive for Mgen should ideally be followed up with an assay capable of detecting mutations that mediate antimicrobial resistance. The European Guideline on Mgen infections, in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=2016 European guideline on Mycoplasma genitalium infections | pmid=27505296 | doi=10.1111/jdv.13849 | volume=30 | year=2016 | author=Jensen JS, Cusini M, Gomberg M, Moi H | journal=J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol | pages=1650–1656}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended complementing the molecular detection of Mgen with an assay capable of detecting macrolide resistance-associated mutations.

''Mycoplasma genitalium'' was originally isolated in 1980 from [[urethral]] [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s of two male patients suffering from [[non-gonococcal urethritis]] in the genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic at [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor-Robinson|first1=D.|last2=Horner|first2=P.

The comparison of genome sequences with other urinogenital bacteria, such as ''[[Mycoplasma hominis|M. hominis]]'' and ''[[Ureaplasma parvum]]'', revealed that ''M. genitalium'' is significantly different, especially in the [[Metabolic pathways|energy-generating pathways]], although it shared a core genome of ~250 protein-encoding genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanchard|first1=Alain|last2=Bébéar|first2=Cécile|title=The evolution of ''Mycoplasma genitalium''|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=2011|volume=1230|issue=1|pages=E61–E64|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06418.x|pmid=22417108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The discovery of [[Protein M]], a new protein from ''M. genitalium'', was announced in February 2014.&lt;ref name=scripps/&gt; The protein was identified during investigations on the origin of [[multiple myeloma]], a B-cell hematologic neoplasm. To understand the long-term ''Mycoplasma'' infection, it was found that [[antibodies]] from multiple myeloma patients' blood were recognised by ''M. genitalium''. The antibody reactivity was due to a protein never known before, and is chemically responsive to all types of human and nonhuman antibodies available. The protein is about 50 kDa in size, and composed of 556 amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grover|first1=R.

== Future considerations ==
Future research must focus on the development of novel [[antimicrobial]]s and [[treatment algorithm]]s that emphasize on [[Antimicrobial therapy|dual antimicrobial therapy]] and AMR testing in treatment protocols. Importantly, most patients with MG are treated syndromically and this treatment is even more compromised by the emerging resistances to several antimicrobials. This also stresses the importance of evidence-based knowledge regarding the activity of novel antimicrobials against several pathogens that cause STIs. The rapid development of AMR in Mgen suggests that single-dose antimicrobial monotherapy may be inappropriate even for uncomplicated STIs. For Mgen, antimicrobial combination therapy and AMR testing, in conjunction with the development and evaluation of new classes of antimicrobials, are of utmost importance. Some of the novel antimicrobials, particularly the fluoroketolide [[solithromycin]], might at least temporarily replace [[azithromycin]] in the treatment of Mgen. Ultimately, the only sustainable solution to control these infections might be the development of vaccines, a task that remains to be incredibly difficult with most pathogens of commonly occurring STIs, being unculturable.

'''Nikolai Arkadievich Dudin '''(born December 22, 1973 in Mikhalkovo, [[Ivanovo Oblast]]), known as the "'''Grim Maniac'''", is a [[Soviet]]-[[Russia|Russian]] [[serial killer]] who killed 13 people in the town of [[Furmanov, Ivanovo Oblast|Furmanov]] between 1987 and 2002.

== Biography ==
Nikolai Dudin was born on December 22, 1973 in the village of Mikhalkovo, Ivanovo Oblast. Dudin suffered greatly because of his father's beatings in his childhood, as well as specific skills that his father instilled in him, such as teaching him [[hunting]] at a young age and even cutting up the warm carcasses of dead animals. In the end, all of this led to Nikolai shooting his father with a [[sawed-off shotgun]] on December 3, 1987. Arkady Dudin's body was well hidden, but after a year Nikolai was arrested for rape, and confessed to his father's murder. The court considered that at the time of the murder, Nikolai was still under 14 years of age, and did not execute him, instead imprisoning him for 7 years. Subsequently, he was repeatedly penalized for defiance of the administration, trying to organize a riot and escape, attempting to kill a prisoner from a neighboring cell, as a result of which he was again convicted and released in 2000, 12 years after the conviction.

The next murder Dudin committed was on February 15, 2002. His victim was an employee of the Furmanov telecommunications company. In a state of [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]], he struck her with a hard blunt object on the head, breaking the base of the skull, as a result of which the victim died. Dudin subsequently claimed that he had wanted to rob her. On the same day, he committed a double murder, this time the victims being two employees of a local sewing shop. As it later turned out, the drunk Dudin had decided to get acquainted with the girls, but they rejected his advances, prompting him to stab them with a knife, causing a total of 28 wounds on the first woman, and 32 on the second.&lt;ref name="рг"&gt;{{cite web|author=Елена Аристархова.|date=20 August 2004 |at=№3554|url=http://www.rg.ru/2004/08/20/a36103.html|title=Обидчивый маньяк|trans-title=The grim maniac |publisher=[[Российская газета]]|accessdate={{safesubst:date|2010-11-7}}|lang=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The killer committed the following murders during the May holidays: on the night between May 1st and 2nd, 2002, a resident of the city disappeared without a trace, her body being discovered only after Dudin was arrested. On May 8, he committed a triple murder. In a state of intoxication, he leaned on the face of a house on Kremlyovskaya Street, bringing it down. The owner of the house, Andrei Polozov, was present, and Dudin pulled out his sawn-off and opened fire. Then he shot the wife and killed their 11-year-old daughter with a knife. On May 10, Dudin committed another triple murder under similar circumstances. The situation in the city was heated, and panic ensued, as Dudin committed a double murder shortly after.

On July 17, 2002, the killer was captured red-handed with a new murder attempt. On August 6, 2002, he wrote a confession, explaining his motive was that he killed people who humiliated his dignity. In December 2003, Dudin was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] in a special regime colony by the Ivanono District Court. The [[Supreme Court of Russia]] then upheld the verdict without change. He is currently serving his sentence in the [[White Swan (prison)|White Swan]] prison.

'''''Outward Bound''''' is a 1923 play written by [[Sutton Vane]].

==Synopsis==
A group of seven passengers meet in the lounge of an ocean liner at sea and realise that they have no idea why they are there, or where they are bound. Each of them eventually discovers that they are dead, and that they have to face judgment from an Examiner, who will determine whether they are to go to Heaven or Hell.

==Production==
Producers stayed away from such an unusual combination of fantasy and drama, so Vane staged it himself, painting his own backdrops and building his own sets, at a reported cost of $600. The play proved to be a huge success, becoming the hit of the 1923 London season, transferring from the small [[Everyman Cinema, Hampstead]] to the [[West End theatre|West End]].

===Broadway production===

Such was the initial response to ''Outward Bound'' that theatrical producer [[William Harris Jr.]] purchased the American rights before the play even opened in the West End.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=October 28, 1923 |title=Harris Scores a Beat |work=The Indianapolis Sunday Star  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by [[Robert Milton (director)|Robert Milton]],&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; the Broadway production premiered January 7, 1924, at the Ritz Theatre, running for 144 performances until May 1924.&lt;ref name="IBDB"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/outward-bound-9455 |title=Outward Bound |publisher=[[Internet Broadway Database]] |access-date=2018-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Broadcast cast is recorded at the [[Internet Broadway Database]]:&lt;ref name="IBDB"/&gt;

* [[Dudley Digges (actor)|Dudley Digges]] as Rev. Frank Thomson
* [[Margalo Gillmore]] as Ann
* Charlotte Granville as Mrs. Cliveden-Banks
* [[Leslie Howard]] as Henry
* [[J. M. Kerrigan]] as Scrubby
* [[Alfred Lunt]] as Mr. Prior
* [[Beryl Mercer]] as Mrs. Midget
* Eugene Powers as Mr. Lingley
* Lyonel Watts as Rev. William Duke

==Revivals==

There were London revivals in 1926, 1928 and 1940. In the last of these, the original player of Scrubby, the [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]]-like barman, was played by its creator, Stanley Lathbury, with [[Cathleen Nesbitt]], [[Sarah Churchill (actress)|Sarah Churchill]], [[Louise Hampton]], [[Terence De Marney]] and [[Anthony Hawtrey]].&lt;ref&gt;"Mr Vane Sutton-Vane", ''The Times'', 19 June 1963, p. 15; and "Theatres", ''The Times'', 7 August 1940, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was revived on Broadway at the [[Playhouse Theatre (New York City)|Playhouse Theatre]], from 22 December 1938 to 22 July 1939, running for 255 performances. This production was directed by [[Otto Preminger]], and featured [[Laurette Taylor]], [[Helen Chandler]], and [[Vincent Price]].

The play was revived in London at the [[Finborough Theatre]] in 2012, with a cast comprising [[David Brett]], [[Natalie Walter]], Tom Davey, Nicholas Karimi, Carmen Rodriguez, Paul Westwood, Ursula Mohan, Derek Howard and [[Martin Wimbush]].&lt;ref&gt;"Theatre: Outward Bound", ''The Stage'', 9 February 2012, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

Vane wrote a novelization of his play, ''Outward Bound: A Novel'', published in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vane |first=Sutton |date=1829 |title=Outward Bound: A Novel |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/outward-bound-a-novel/oclc/774546720 |location=London |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |author-link=Sutton Vane |oclc=774546720 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A film adaptation titled ''[[Outward Bound (film)|Outward Bound]]'' (1930) was produced by [[Warner Bros.]] The studio engaged Robert Milton, director of the Broadway production, to direct the motion picture. Dudley Digges, Beryl Mercer and Lyonel Watts reprised their Broadway roles; Leslie Howard, who had played Henry in the stage production, starred in the role that had been played by Alfred Lunt.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hall |first=Mordaunt |date=September 18, 1930 |title=The Screen: Away from the World |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1930/09/18/archives/the-screen-away-from-the-world.html |work=The New York Times |authorlink=Mordaunt Hall  |access-date=2018-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was remade as ''[[Between Two Worlds (film)|Between Two Worlds]]'' (1944), with some changes reflecting [[World War II]]. [[John Garfield]], [[Paul Henreid]], [[Sydney Greenstreet]], and [[Eleanor Parker]] starred.

'''PS ''Guide''''' was a passenger vessel built for the [[River Dart Steamboat Co Ltd#Dartmouth Steam Packet Co Ltd|Dartmouth Steam Packet Company]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duckworth |first1=Christian Leslie Dyce |last2=Langmuir |first2=Graham Easton |date=1968 |title=Railway and other Steamers |trans-title= |url= |dead-url= |format= |language=English |location=Prescot, Lancashire |publisher= T. Stephenson and Sons, |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |subscription= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

She was built by Harvey and Company of Hayle and launched on 7 September 1869 by Miss Alice Vincent. Her owners, the [[River Dart Steamboat Co Ltd#Dartmouth Steam Packet Co Ltd|Dartmouth Steam Packet Company]] intended her as a powerful steam tug boat, and a passenger vessel for the summer trade in trips to the Channel Islands and France.

She was sold to the [[West Cornwall Steam Ship Company]] in 1872 when they lost both of their vessels and kept in service until 1875.

She was sold to Jackson and Ford of London and Milford in 1877, then Joseph Lawson of South Shields in 1883. In 1888 she was resold to John &amp; David Morris, Pelaw Main and was reconstructed and converted to screw by Abbot &amp; Co of Gateshead and renamed Jubilant. On 27 November 1897 it sailed from Maldon for the Tyne and its fate is unknown. In February 1898 it was assumed that the vessel was lost in the gale of 29 November 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Loss of a Newcastle Steamer |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001123/18920610/104/0005 |newspaper=Hartlepool Mail |location=Hartlepool |date=9 February 1898 |access-date=10 October 2015 |via = [[British Newspaper Archive]] |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coincidentally, another Pigasus was a character in the [[Oz books|''Oz'' books]] written by [[Ruth Plumly Thompson]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Snow (writer)|Jack Snow]], ''Who's Who in Oz'', Chicago, Reilly &amp; Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Her Pigasus was also a winged pig. As with [[Pegasus]], his riders gained the gift of poesy, being magically compelled to speak in rhyming jingles while on his back.  The character first appeared in ''[[Pirates in Oz]]'' and played a major role in the plot of ''[[The Wishing Horse of Oz]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="891">'''Primary cremation'''  and '''secondary cremation''' are terms in [[archaeology]] for describing [[burial]]s of  [[Cremation|cremated]] bodies.

Primary cremation refers to burials where the body is burned "on the spot", in the grave. A secondary cremation is the burning of the body in one spot and then burying the remains and [[grave good]]s elsewhere. Secondary cremation may also more specifically refer to a cremation where the body is burned on a [[pyre]], after which the bones are collected from the ashes and buried elsewhere (Sprague 2005:138). A famous account of such a burial is that of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', describing the funeral of [[Patroclus]].

[[File:Original manuscript of Death and the Maiden Quartet.jpeg|thumb|300px|Original manuscript of ''Death and the Maiden'' quartet, from the [[Mary Flagler Cary|Mary Flagler Cary Music Collection]], [[Morgan Library]], New York]]
[[File:T&amp;M.jpg|thumb|Original manuscript of ''Death and the Maiden'' quartet]]
The '''String Quartet No. 14 in D minor''', known as '''''Death and the Maiden''''', is a piece by [[Franz Schubert]] that has been called "one of the pillars of the [[chamber music]] repertoire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/string-quartet-no-14-death-and-maiden-franz-schubert|title=STRING QUARTET NO. 14 “DEATH AND THE MAIDEN”|last=Rothwell|first=Jessie|publisher=Los Angeles Philharmonic Association|accessdate=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was composed in 1824, after the composer suffered a serious illness and realized that he was dying. It is named for the [[Theme (music)|theme]] of the second [[Movement (music)|movement]], which Schubert took from a [[Der Tod und das Mädchen|song he wrote in 1817 of the same title]]. Some interpret it as Schubert's testament to death, and find that the theme of death is palpable in all four movements of the quartet{{cn|date=May 2018}}.

The quartet was first played in 1826 in a private home, and was not published until 1831, three years after Schubert's death. It is D&amp;nbsp;810 in [[Otto Erich Deutsch]]'s [[Schubert Thematic Catalogue|thematic catalog of Schubert's works]].

==Composition==
1823 and 1824 were hard years for Schubert. For much of 1823 he was sick, some scholars believe with an outburst of tertiary stage syphilis, and in May had to be hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1982), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also without money: he had entered into a disastrous deal with [[Anton Diabelli|Diabelli]] to publish a batch of works, and received almost no payment; and his latest attempt at opera, ''[[Fierabras]]'', was a flop. In a letter to a friend, he wrote,

{{quote|Think of a man whose health can never be restored, and who from sheer despair makes matters worse instead of better. Think, I say, of a man whose brightest hopes have come to nothing, to whom love and friendship are but torture, and whose enthusiasm for the beautiful is fast vanishing; and ask yourself if such a man is not truly unhappy.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Leopold Kupelwieser, March 31, 1824, reprinted in Einstein (1947), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Franz Schubert by Wilhelm August Rieder 1875.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Franz Schubert in 1825 (painting by [[Wilhelm August Rieder]])]]
Yet, despite his bad health, poverty and depression, Schubert continued to turn out the tuneful, light and ''[[Gemütlichkeit|gemütlich]]'' music that made him the toast of Viennese society: the song cycle ''[[Die schöne Müllerin]]'', the [[Octet (Schubert)|octet]] for string quartet, contrabass, clarinet, horn and bassoon, more than 20 songs, and numerous light pieces for piano.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1982), pp. 106–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1820, Schubert returned to the string quartet form, which he had last visited as a teenager. He wrote the one-movement ''[[Quartettsatz, D 703 (Schubert)|Quartettsatz]]'' in 1820, and the ''[[String Quartet No. 13 (Schubert)|Rosamunde]]'' quartet in 1824 using a theme from the incidental music that he wrote for a play that failed. These quartets are a huge step forward from his initial attempts.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Griffiths (1983), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Even Schubert recognized this fact; in July 1824, he wrote his brother Ferdinand of his earlier quartets, "it would be better if you stuck to other quartets than mine, for there is nothing in them..."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Griffiths (1983), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several qualities that set these mature quartets apart from Schubert's earlier attempts. In the early quartets, it is primarily the first violin that carries the melody, with the other instruments playing supporting roles; in the later quartets, the part writing is much more advanced, and each instrument brings its own character and presence, for a more complex and integrated texture. Also, the later quartets are structurally much more integrated, with motifs, harmonies, and textures recurring in a way that ties the entire work together.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the differences between the early and late quartets, see Griffiths (1983), pp. 95–96, and Cobbett (1929), V II, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Baldung 006.jpg|thumb|upright|''{{Lang|de|Der Tod und das Mädchen}}'', [[Hans Baldung Grien]], 1517]]
But beyond these technical improvements, Schubert in these later works made the quartet medium his own. "He had now ceased to write quartets to order, for experimental study, or for the home circle," writes [[Walter Willson Cobbett]]. "To the independent artist... the string quartet had now also become a vehicle for conveying to the world his inner struggles."&lt;ref&gt;Cobbett (1929), Volume II, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; For Schubert, who lived a life suspended between the lyrical, romantic, charming and the dramatic, chaotic, and depressive, the string quartet offered a medium "to reconcile his essentially lyric themes with his feeling for dramatic utterance within a form that provided the possibility of extreme color contrasts," writes music historian Homer Ulrich.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich (1966), p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schubert wrote the D minor quartet in March 1824,&lt;ref&gt;Composer and editor [[Franz Lachner]] mistakenly dated the quartet to 1826, when it was first played in public. Brown (1982), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; within weeks of completing the A minor [[String Quartet No. 13 (Schubert)|''Rosamunde'' quartet]]. He apparently planned to publish a three-set volume of quartets; but the Rosamunde was published within a year, while the D minor quartet was only published in 1831, three years after Schubert's death, by Diabelli.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1984), p. 72. The urtext score is published by Baerenreiter Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first played in January 1826 at the Vienna home of Karl and Franz Hacker, amateur violinists, apparently with Schubert on the viola.&lt;ref&gt;Berger (2001), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
The quartet takes its name from the [[lied]] "[[Der Tod und das Mädchen]]", D&amp;nbsp;531, a setting of the poem of the same name by [[Matthias Claudius]] that Schubert wrote in 1817. The theme of the song forms the basis of the second movement of the quartet. The theme is a death knell that accompanies the song about the terror and comfort of death.

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;''The Maiden'':
"Oh! leave me! Prithee, leave me! thou grisly man of bone!
For life is sweet, is pleasant.
Go! leave me now alone!
Go! leave me now alone!"

''Death'':
"Give me thy hand, oh! maiden fair to see,
For I'm a friend, hath ne'er distress'd thee.
Take courage now, and very soon
Within mine arms shalt softly rest thee!"&lt;ref&gt;Translation by P. Jurgenson, c. 1920 in Chaliapin (c. 1920), p. 40. The translation is somewhat free, here is a more literal rendering:
''The Maiden'':
"Away! Ah, Away! thou cruel man of bone!
I am still young. Go, instead.
And do not touch me!"
''Death'':
"Give me thy hand, you fair and tender creature,
I'm a friend, and do not come to punish.
Be of good courage; I am not cruel
You shall sleep gently in my arms."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

But it is not only this theme of the quartet that recalls death. The quote from the song "makes explicit the overriding theme of the work, its bleak vision and almost unremitting foreboding," writes Andrew Clements.&lt;ref&gt;Clements (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; From the violent opening unison. the first movement runs a relentless race through terror, pain and resignation, ending with a dying D minor chord. "The struggle with Death is the subject of the first movement, and the andante accordingly dwells on Death's words," writes Cobbett.&lt;ref name=C359&gt;Cobbett (1929), V II, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; After a scherzo movement, with a trio that provides the only lyrical respite from the depressing mood of the piece, the quartet ends with a [[tarantella]] – the traditional dance to ward off madness and death. "The finale is most definitely in the character of a dance of death; ghastly visions whirl past in the inexorable uniform rhythm of the tarantella," writes Cobbett.&lt;ref name=C359 /&gt;

So strong is the association of death with the quartet that some analysts consider it to be [[Program music|programmatic]], rather than [[absolute music]]. "The first movement of Schubert's ''Death and the Maiden'' string quartet can be interpreted in a quasi-programmatic fashion, even though it is usually viewed as an abstract work," writes Deborah Kessler.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian Frank Ruppert sees the quartet as a musical expression of Judaeo-Christian religious myths. "This quartet, like so many of Schubert's works, is a kind of para-liturgy," he writes. Each movement is about a different episode in the mythic process of death and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Ruppert (2009), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The quartet throughout is characterized by sudden dramatic shifts from [[fortissimo]] to [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]], from the lyrical to the compelling and dramatic. A driving undercurrent of triplets is a recurring motif in all four movements.&lt;ref&gt;For more analyses, see Loft (1992), pp. 161–183, Heuss (1919), pp. 120 et seq., or [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/discoveringmusic/listeninglibrary.shtml ''Death and the Maiden''] in the BBC Discovering Music: Listening Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four movements:
# [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Allegro]], in [[D minor]] and [[common time]] ({{music|time|4|4}})
# [[Andante (tempo)|Andante]] con moto, in [[G minor]] and [[cut time]] ({{music|time|2|2}})
# [[Scherzo]]: Allegro molto, in D minor and [[3/4 time|{{music|time|3|4}} time]]
# [[Presto (music)|Presto]], in D minor and {{music|time|6|8}} time

===First movement: Allegro===
{|
|-
|In the 14-[[bar (music)|measure]] introduction, Schubert establishes the elements that will carry through the entire movement. The quartet begins with a unison D, played fortissimo, and a [[triplet (music)|triplet]] figure, that establishes the triplet [[motif (music)|motif]]. Three and a half measures of fortissimo break off into a sudden, pianissimo [[chorale]], the first of the many violent shifts of mood that occur throughout.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 1 opening.ogg|thumb|right|Opening of the quartet&lt;ref&gt;Musical examples are taken from the performance of the Yorkside quartet (Kensho Watanabe and Andrew Paik, violins, Jonathan Bregman, viola, Scott McCreary, cello) at Yale University, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
|-
|After the introduction, Schubert presents the first [[theme (music)|theme]]: a continuation of the chorale motif, but with the triplets motif rippling through the lower voices, in a restless, unremitting stream.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 1 first theme.ogg|thumb|Main theme of the movement]]
|-
|The triplet motif is transmuted into a connecting theme of its own, leading to the second theme in [[F major]].
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 1 second theme.ogg|thumb|Second theme]]
|-
|The second theme is repeated, with an accompaniment of [[sixteenth note]]s.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 1 second theme w 16ths.ogg|thumb|Second theme, with 16th notes accompaniment]]
|-
|The sixteenth note passage [[modulation (music)|modulates]] through a range of [[Key signature|keys]], finally settling on [[A major]], where it continues as an [[accompaniment]] to a restatement of the second theme in the second violin. The exposition ends with a transformation of the second theme, this time wrenched into a violent outburst in [[A minor]].
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 1 end development.ogg|thumb|End of the exposition]]
|-
|The [[musical development|development]] concentrates on the two forms of the second theme: the lilting, quiet version, and the violent inverted form. The section fluctuates between a fading relaxation and fortissimo. Toward the end of the development, Schubert reintroduces the triplet motif of the first theme, leading to the [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]].
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 1 development.ogg|thumb|Development. The maiden remonstrates against Death, Death wheedles and cajoles]]
|-
|Here the opening themes return, with variants. The music moves to [[D major]], for a relaxed recapitulation of the second theme, then returns to D minor. A chorale reminiscent of the introduction leads to the [[coda (music)|coda]]. But even in the chorale, the tension does not relax, with a sudden fortepiano interrupting the quiet. The opening theme returns, played at a rushed tempo, like a sudden resurgence of life, growing to a climax that suddenly breaks off and the triplet motif, played at the original slower tempo, dies away to the end of the movement.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 1 end.ogg|thumb|End of the first movement. The maiden is close to death. Suddenly a spurt of life, hope, the music rushes and moves to major. But then, a return to minor, and the music pulses to its death]]
|}

===Second movement: Andante con moto===
{|
|-
|The second movement is a theme and five variations, based on the theme from the Schubert Lied. The theme is like a death march in G minor, ending on a G major chord. Throughout the movement, Schubert does not deviate from the basic harmonic and sentence structure of the 24-measure theme. But each variation expresses a profoundly different emotion.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 2 theme.ogg|thumb|right|Theme of the second movement]]
|-
|In the first variation, a lilting violin descant floats above the theme, played in pulsing triplets in the second violin and viola that recall the triplets of the first movement.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 2 var 1.ogg|thumb|right|First variation]]
|-
|In the second variation, the cello carries the theme, with the first violin playing the pulsating role – this time in sixteenth notes.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 2 var 2.ogg|thumb|right|Second variation]]
|-
|After two relaxed variations, the third variation returns to the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' character of the overall piece: a galloping ''fortissimo'' figure breaks off suddenly into ''piano''; the violin plays a variant of the theme in a high register, while the inner voices continue the gallop.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 2 var 3.ogg|thumb|right|Third variation]]
|-
|The fourth variation is again lyrical, with the second violin and cello carrying the melody under a long violin line in triplets. This is the only variation in a major key – G major.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 2 var 4.ogg|thumb|right|Fourth variation]]
|-
|In the fifth variation, the second violin takes up the theme, while the first violin plays a sixteenth-note arpeggiated motif, with the cello playing the triplets in the bass. The variation grows from ''pianissimo'' to ''fortissimo'', then again fades and slows in pace, finally returning to a restatement of the theme – this time in G major.
|[[File:Death and the Maiden mvt 2 var 5.ogg|thumb|right|Fifth variation]]
|}

===Third movement: Scherzo Allegro molto===
[[File:Yorkside Quartet Death and the Maiden Mvt 3 theme.ogg|thumb|right|Theme of the scherzo movement]]
[[File:Yorkside Quartet Death and the Maiden Mvt 3 trio.ogg|thumb|right|Trio section of the scherzo]]
Cobbett describes the third movement as the "dance of the demon fiddler".&lt;ref name=C359 /&gt; There is indeed something demonic in this fast-paced scherzo, full of syncopations and, like the other movements, dramatic leaps from ''fortissimo'' to ''pianissimo''.

The scherzo is designed as a classical minuet: two strains in {{music|time|3|4}} time, repeated, in D minor, followed by a contrasting trio section in D major, at a slower tempo, and ending with a recapitulation of the opening strains. The trio section is the only real respite from the compelling pace of the whole quartet: a typically Schubertesque melody, with the first violin playing a dancing descant above the melody line in the lower voices, then the viola takes the melody as the first violin plays high eighth notes.

The scherzo is a short movement, serving as an interlude leading to the frenetic last movement.

===Fourth movement: Presto===
The finale of the quartet is a [[tarantella]] in [[rondo]]-sonata form, in D minor. The tarantella is a breakneck Italian dance in 6/8 time, that, according to tradition, was a treatment for madness and convulsions brought on by the bite of a [[tarantula]] spider. Appropriately, Cobbett calls this movement "a [[Danse Macabre|dance of death]]."&lt;ref name=C359 /&gt;

The movement is built of sections. The first, main section recurs between each of the subsequent sections.

{|
|-
|The movement opens with the main section of the rondo in unison, with a theme based on a dotted figure. The theme is traditionally bowed in the reverse direction from the usual bowing of dotted passages.&lt;ref&gt;Down bow on the upbeat, up bow on the downbeat. This bowing is not marked in the ''urtext'' edition, but appears almost universally in all edited versions. See for example, the Peters edition, edited by Carl Herrmann.&lt;/ref&gt; This has the effect of moving the accent onto the off-beat, giving the entire passage the character of a limping dance.
|[[File:Yorkside Quartet Death and the Maiden Mvt 4 theme.ogg|thumb|right|Theme of the last movement]]
|-
|The theme develops characteristically, with sudden lurches from loud to soft and running triplets, leading to the second section of the rondo: a broad, chorale-like theme. Cobbett identifies this theme as a quote from another song of Schubert's, ''[[Der Erlkönig]]'', about a child who dies at the hands of king of the forest. The terrified child turns to his father for protection, but his father does not see the spirit, and ignores the child's pleas until the child is dead in his arms. "There is deep meaning in the appearance of this phrase," writes Cobbett.&lt;ref name=C359 /&gt; The chorale motif continues, with a flowing triplet accompaniment in the first violin that recalls the fourth variation of the ''Andante'' movement. This leads to a restatement of the main theme.
|[[File:Yorkside Quartet Death and the Maiden Mvt 4 B section.ogg|thumb|right|Second section: a chorale melody, with triplets accompanying]]
|-
|Here the triplet motif of the opening of the quartet also reappears, in disguised form. Then the chorale theme recurs, leading to the second statement of the main section.

The third section of the rondo begins. This is a complex, involuted section with chromatic swirls of triplets and [[hemiola]]s that cause the listener to lose all sense of downbeat. This leads into a recapitulation of the second section, and then a return of the main section of the rondo.
|[[File:Yorkside Quartet Death and the Maiden Mvt 4 C section.ogg|thumb|right|Third section: convoluted harmonies, offbeat rhythms]]
|-
|A crescendo leads to the ''Prestissimo'' coda of the movement and of the piece. The coda begins in D major, suggesting a triumphant end – a device common in classical and romantic quartets. But in this case, the coda suddenly returns to D minor, for a tumultuous and tragic conclusion.
|[[File:Yorkside Quartet Death and the Maiden Mvt 4 Coda.ogg|thumb|right|Coda of the last movement]]

After the initial reading of the quartet in 1826, the quartet was played again at a house concert in the home of composer [[Franz Lachner]], with violinist [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]] leading. Schuppanzigh, one of the leading violinists of the time, who debuted many of Beethoven's and Schubert's quartets, was reportedly unimpressed. "Brother, this is nothing at all, let well alone: stick to your Lieder," the aging Schuppanzigh is reported to have said to Schubert.&lt;ref&gt;Reminiscences by Lachner published in 1881 in the Viennese ''Presse'', retold at [http://www.fuguemasters.com/schubert.html#D810 ''Sierra Chamber Society Program Notes''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930015904/http://www.fuguemasters.com/schubert.html#D810 |date=2012-09-30 }} (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Schuppanzigh's impressions notwithstanding, Schubert's quartet soon won a leading place on the concert stage and in the hearts of musicians. "Only the excellence of such a work as Schubert's D minor Quartet... can in any way console us for the early and grievous death of this first-born of Beethoven; in a few years he achieved and perfected things as no one before him," wrote [[Robert Schumann]] of the quartet.&lt;ref&gt;Schumann, "A Retrospective View", in Schumann (1946) p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

The quartet has been honored by several transcriptions. In 1878, [[Robert Franz]] transcribed it for piano duet, and in 1896 [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] planned an arrangement for string orchestra and notated the details in a score of the quartet (the work was never completed, however, and only the second movement was written out and played; the modern revival of the arrangement is in a version edited by [[David Matthews (composer)|David Matthews]]).

In the 20th century, British composer [[John Foulds]] and American composer [[Andy Stein]] made versions for full symphony orchestra.

At [[Fridtjof Nansen]]'s state funeral in 1930, ''Death and the Maiden'' was performed instead of speeches.

The quartet has also inspired other works. [[Ariel Dorfman]]'s 1991 play ''[[Death and the Maiden (play)|Death and the Maiden]]'', [[Death and the Maiden (film)|adapted for film]] in 1994 by [[Roman Polanski]], is about a woman tortured and raped in a South American dictatorship, to the strains of the quartet. It has also appeared as incidental music in numerous films: ''[[The Portrait of a Lady (film)|The Portrait of a Lady]]'' ([[Jane Campion]], 1996), ''[[What? (film)|What?]]'' (Roman Polanski, 1972), ''[[Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking]]'' (BBC production, 2004), and in [[Samuel Beckett]]'s radio play ''[[All That Fall]]'' (1962).

[[File:Tux Droid 1.jpg|thumb|The Tux Droid]]
'''Tux Droid''' is a [[Linux]] wireless [[Tux (mascot)|Tux]] mascot (210mm × 180mm × 140mm - with lowered wings) with a programmable interface, allowing it to announce events by its gestures and by [[Advanced Linux Sound Architecture|ALSA]] driven sound. The events are detected by specific gadgets, which are handled by the Tux Gadget Manager. The Tux Droid supports [[Linux kernel]] 2.4 or later and needs an 800&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and 128 MB [[Random access memory|RAM]]. Communication from Tux Droid to the computer is via signalling operating in the 802.11 WLAN band, but not compatible with [[Wi-Fi]]. The receiver resembles a plastic fish, and connects to the host computer's [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] port.  An infrared remote control is supplied; signals from this are received by Tux Droid and sent to the host software over the wireless link. For media detection it needs an internet connection. The mascot is driven by [[Atmel AVR]] RISC microcontrollers.
The new version supports also Windows-based PCs. The Tux Droid can be used with [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Vista]] (both at 32 Bit).

== Information ==
Kysoh society has filed for bankruptcy in August 2010.
Official sites are unavailable.
Two communities are available to get help and information on Tux Droid.{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}

== Features ==
The mascot comes with a microphone and an infrared receiver, to perform a 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz wireless full-duplex digital link between the USB dongle. The Tux Droid also has a light sensor and a push button on top of the head. Its gestures cover e.g. eye- and wing-movements, while switch sensors in both wings are triggered by pushing the wings. For its sound output there is a volume control wheel to control a speaker and a 3.5mm stereo audio socket for audio out.

The software, which comes with the mascot, so far combines just some primary gadgets (some more are under development, such as a [[Skype]] and an AI [[Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity|ALICE]] chat robot).

==Career==
He was the 2nd son of John Adyn, bailiff of Dorchester, and his wife Edith Barbet. He married Mary, daughter of Robert Reve of [[Blandford Forum|Blandford]].

He held the following offices: burgess in Dorchester in 1560, bailiff  in 1564-1565, receiver of rents 1573-1579, trustee of Dorchester school 1579.
"In 1591 he was involved in a [[Star Chamber]] case relating to the manors of Frome Billet and West Stafford, being accused of riot and suppression of the truth at the assizes." He acted against the Dorchester authorities in 1585. And as a result Matthew Chubbe brought an action in the Star Chamber against him. &lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

'''William Broderick Cloete''' (1851 &amp;ndash; 7 May 1915) was a South African-born British industrialist active in the border zones between [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]] in the late 19th century. He and [[Robert Symon]], an industrialist from [[Boston]], purchased 1.3 million [[acre]]s of land between [[Monterrey]] and [[Saltillo]], which constituted the only workable railway route between Monterrey and the interior of Mexico. After the [[Mexican National Construction Company]] chose to plot the [[Mexican National Railroad]] across this land, Symon sold his stake for $60,000 to a group of British investors incorporated as the San Marcos and Pinos company, while Cloete - who gained an additional advantage from land ownership, since the railway would access several mines he owned - retained his stake, eventually becoming a director of the new company.{{sfn|Hart|2006|p=182}} On 18 July 1902 he married Violet Kate Henley, the daughter of Joseph Arthur Henley; they maintained a residence in Hare Park outside [[London]].&lt;ref name = "lus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Saturday |date=19 July 1902 |page_number=12 |issue=36824| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloete is also noted for his belief in the legend of the [[Lost Nigger Gold Mine]]; he offered Lock Campbell, a Texan man, expenses of $10,000 if he would undertake an expedition to find it.{{sfn|Dobie|1978|p=155}} On 19 July 1899, Campbell and four other men signed an agreement to search for it, and one of the men later claimed to have discovered it in the [[Ladron Peak|Ladrones Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], but this was never verified.{{sfn|Braddy|1945|p=360}} He died in the [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania]] on 7 May 1915, but his body was never identified.&lt;ref name = "lus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmslusitania.info/people/saloon/william-brodrick-cloete/|title=Mr. William Brodrick-Cloete - The Lusitania Resource|work=The Lusitania Resource|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''zona pellucida''' (plural '''zonae pellucidae''', also '''egg coat''' or '''pellucid zone''') is a [[glycoprotein]] layer surrounding the [[plasma membrane]] of [[mammal]]ian [[oocyte]]s. It is a vital constitutive part of the oocyte. The zona pellucida first appears in unilaminar primary oocytes. It is secreted by both the oocyte and the [[ovarian follicle]]s. The zona pellucida is surrounded by the [[cumulus oophorus]]. The cumulus is composed of cells that care for the egg when it is emitted from the ovary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Scott|title=Developmental Biology|date=2013|publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc|isbn=9781605351926|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This structure binds [[spermatozoa]], and is required to initiate the [[acrosome reaction]].
In the mouse (the best characterised mammalian system), the zona glycoprotein, [[ZP3]], is responsible for sperm binding, adhering to [[protein]]s on the sperm plasma membrane (GalT).  ZP3 is then involved in the induction of the acrosome reaction, whereby a spermatozoon releases the contents of the [[acrosome|acrosomal vesicle]]. The exact characterisation of what occurs in other species has become more complicated as further zona proteins have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12968942 |year=2003 |last1=Conner |first1=SJ |last2=Hughes |first2=DC |title=Analysis of fish ZP1/ZPB homologous genes--evidence for both genome duplication and species-specific amplification models of evolution |volume=126 |issue=3 |pages=347–52 |journal=Reproduction |doi=10.1530/rep.0.1260347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1148–52 |doi=10.1093/humrep/deh835 |title=Cracking the egg: Increased complexity in the zona pellucida |year=2005 |last1=Conner |first1=S.J. |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=20 |issue=5 |pmid=15760956 |last2=Lefièvre |first2=L |last3=Hughes |first3=DC |last4=Barratt |first4=CL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, five days after the fertilization, the [[blastocyst]] performs [[zona hatching]]; the zona pellucida degenerates and decomposes, to be replaced by the underlying layer of [[trophoblast]]ic cells.

The zona pellucida is essential for oocyte growth and [[fertilization]].

In some older texts, it has also been called '''zona striata''' and '''stratum lucidum'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J. T. |last1=Wigham |year=1936 |title=Endometrioma and other similar abnormalities |journal=Irish Journal of Medical Science |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=279–80 |doi=10.1007/BF02956856}}&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with the [[stratum lucidum]] of the skin).

==Immunocontraception==
[[Zona pellucida-like domain|ZP module]]-containing glycoproteins [[ZP1,]] [[ZP2]], [[ZP3]] and [[ZP4]] are targets for [[immunocontraception]] in mammals.

In non-mammals, the zona pellucida is called the [[vitelline membrane]] or envelope, and the [[vitelline envelope]] in [[insect]]s, and plays an important role in preventing cross-breeding of different species, especially in species such as [[fish]] that fertilize outside of the body.

The zona pellucida is commonly used to control wildlife population problems by immunocontraception. When the zona pellucida of one animal species is injected into the bloodstream of another, it results in sterility of the second species due to [[immune response]]. This effect can be temporary or permanent, depending on the method used. In [[New Jersey]], immunocontraception using [[porcine zona pellucida]] has been trialled for the control of [[deer]] populations, for example using the products "SpayVac" and "GonaCon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community-Based Deer Management|url=http://www.state.nj.us/dep/fgw/cbdmp.htm|publisher=New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection|accessdate=8 July 2015|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zona pellucida glycoproteins==
There are four major ''zona pellucida glycoproteins'', termed ZP1-4. [[ZP1]], [[ZP3]] and [[ZP4]] bind to capacitated spermatozoa and induce the [[acrosome reaction]]. Successful [[fertilization]] depends on the ability of sperm to penetrate the [[extracellular matrix]] that surrounds the egg.
In the mouse:
*[[ZP3]] allows species-specific sperm binding
*[[ZP2]] mediates subsequent sperm binding
*[[ZP1]] cross-links ZP2 and ZP3.

Data with native human protein are not currently available.
