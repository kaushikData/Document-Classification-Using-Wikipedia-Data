A '''political crisis''' began in [[Zimbabwe]] on 11 March 2007 when opposition leader [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] was beaten and tortured after being arrested, prompting widespread domestic and international criticism.

*14 March: Two female officers were seriously injured in a fire-bomb attack on a police station in [[Harare]]; the government blamed the opposition [[Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai|Movement for Democratic Change]] (MDC).

*15 March: [[President of Zimbabwe|President]] [[Robert Mugabe]] made a statement about Western criticism of his regime: "When they criticise the government when it tries to prevent violence and punish perpetrators of that violence we take the position that they can go hang."[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6454827.stm]
*17 March: Four ranking members of the opposition were refused permission to leave the country, some of them seeking treatment for injuries inflicted in police custody. [[House of Assembly of Zimbabwe|MP]] [[Nelson Chamisa]] said he was beaten at [[Harare Airport]]; doctors later reported that he  had received a fractured skull. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6463653.stm]
*21 March: [[Levy Mwanawasa]], president of neighbouring [[Zambia]], likened the situation in Zimbabwe "to a sinking ''Titanic'' whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives".[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6475851.stm]
*21 March: The United States Ambassador to Zimbabwe, [[Christopher Dell]], said that the country's people had "turned a corner" and were "losing their fear".[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6473579.stm]
*22 March: The [[Roman Catholic]] Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bulawayo|Bulawayo]], [[Pius Ncube]], called for mass public protests to bring pressure to bear on [[President of Zimbabwe|President]] [[Robert Mugabe]] to resign.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6482723.stm]
*23 March: The [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of Australia [[John Howard]] called for the world to work towards ousting Mugabe.[http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0700world/tm_headline=howard-calls-on-africa-to-oust-mugabe&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18797192&amp;siteid=50082-name_page.html]

*29 March: The [[Southern African Development Community]] held a summit in [[Tanzania]], with the Zimbabwe crisis high on its agenda.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6505391.stm]
*8 April: Zimbabwe's [[Roman Catholic]] [[bishop]]s call on the [[President of Zimbabwe]] [[Robert Mugabe]] to stand down or face "open revolt" in a message posted on church bulletin boards across the country.&lt;sup&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/04/08/zimbabwe.easter.ap/index.html?eref=rss_world]&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Action on Hearing Loss''', known until 2011 by its official title, the '''Royal National Institute for Deaf People''' ('''RNID'''), is a [[charitable organization]] working on behalf of the [[United Kingdom|UK's]] 9 million people who are [[Deafness|deaf]] or have hearing loss.  The head office is in [[Islington]], [[London]]. Its President until April 2012 was [[Jack Ashley, Baron Ashley of Stoke|Lord Ashley of Stoke]]. The Chief Executive is [[Paul Breckell]]. Its [[Patron]] is the [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Duke of York]].

==History==
The Royal National Institute for Deaf People was founded as the National Bureau for Promoting the General Welfare of the Deaf in 1911 by Leo Bonn, a deaf merchant banker, at his home 22 Upper Brook Street, [[Mayfair]], on 9 June 1911. The house is marked by a memorial plaque  unveiled by [[The Duke of Edinburgh]], Patron to the RNID, on 9 June 1998.&lt;ref&gt;City of Westminster green plaques {{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |archivedate=16 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bureau was reorganised as the National Institute for the Deaf in 1924. Alongside its role in influencing public policy in favour of people who are hard of hearing in the UK, it also developed a role as a provider of care to deaf and hard of hearing people with additional needs during the late 1920s and early 1930s.

During the 1940s, with the introduction of the [[National Health Service|National Health Service (NHS)]] to the UK, it successfully campaigned for the provision of free [[hearing aid]]s through the new [[welfare state]] system. The 1950s and 1960s saw its increasing influence marked by Royal recognition: in 1958 the Duke of Edinburgh became the Patron of the Institute; and in 1961 [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|H.M. the Queen]] approved the addition of the "Royal" prefix, creating the Royal National Institute for the Deaf (RNID).

The Institute expanded into medical and technological research during the 1960s and 1970s, being a key player in the development of NHS provided behind-the-ear hearing aids. During the 1980s it developed the Telephone Exchange for the Deaf, a pioneering relay service allowing telephone users and deaf "[[textphone]]" users to communicate with each other using a third-party operator to relay voice and text communication. This became the service known as Typetalk in 1991, funded by BT but operated on their behalf by RNID until 7 December 2009 when the RNID stepped down from the service.  It is now solely owned, run and managed by BT alone. In March 2009 the name of the Typetalk service was changed to '''[http://ngts.org.uk/textrelay_index.php Text Relay].'''

In 1992 the Institute changed its name to the Royal National Institute for Deaf People but kept the initials RNID.

June 2011 saw Centenary Celebrations to celebrate 100 years of the RNID and a new change of name - Action on Hearing Loss.
'Action on Hearing Loss' was chosen because it better describes the breadth of help and support they provide for people with all types of hearing loss – from people who are profoundly deaf, to people who are losing their hearing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/about-us/our-new-name.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; 
They trade under the new name 'Action on Hearing Loss', but like a lot of other charities who have changed their names, they will be keeping the legal name, Royal National Institute for Deaf People.

==Activities==
Action on Hearing Loss' activities include:

* campaigning and lobbying, with the help of members, to change laws and government policies
* providing information and raising awareness of deafness, hearing loss and tinnitus
* giving training courses and consultancy on deafness and disability
* offering communication services including sign language interpreters
* making lasting change in education for deaf children and young people
* supporting deaf people into work with the organisations employment programmes
* providing care services for deaf and hard of hearing people with additional needs
* social, medical and technical research.

==Present operations==
Action on Hearing Loss has achieved a high profile for its work in lobbying and working with the UK government on modernisation of the UK's audiology services. This has resulted in the introduction of superior digital hearing aids free of charge via the NHS.

Action on Hearing Loss has also emerged as a major player in technology research and development, in particular through its work in the area of product development. The Action on Hearing Loss Product Development team won an [[Innovation Award]] for their work on a new genre of telephone - the ScreenPhone.

===Hearing check===
Action on Hearing Loss have developed an online [http://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/your-hearing/look-after-your-hearing/check-your-hearing/take-the-check.aspx free, confidential online hearing check], and can identify potential hearing problems. The five-minute check assesses your ability to hear someone speaking when there is background noise. It can indicate whether your hearing is within the normal range or if it is perhaps below normal. The hearing check does not give a medical diagnosis, but Action on Hearing Loss hopes it will prompt people to take action and visit their GP or an audiologist for a fuller assessment. On average, it can take people living in the UK up to 15 years to deal with a hearing loss.

==Early life and education==
Born to Ibrahim, a pearl diver of the Al-Naimi tribe, and Fatima, a [[Bedouin]] of the Ajman, his parents became divorced during the pregnancy.  As a consequence, Naimi was born into and lived the first eight years of his nomadic life with his mother's and stepfather's tribe.  From the age of four, he tended the family's flock of lambs.  His mother divorced his stepfather when Al-Naimi was eight, and Al-Naimi left the Ajmani tribe to live with his father in Al-Hasa.&lt;ref name="Ali"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Al-Naimi |first1=Ali |title=Out of the Desert |date=2016 |publisher=Portfolio Penguin |location=Great Britain |isbn=9780241279250 |pages=xv,5,7,10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali Al-Naimi's older brother Abdullah, was hired by Aramco in 1944, and attended the Jebel School run by the company.  Abdullah took Ali along, where they learned English, Arabic and basic arithmetic in the mornings, then worked as office boys in the afternoon.  Finally, on 6 Dec. 1947, Ali was hired as a junior clerk, but still attended school in the mornings.&lt;ref name=Ali/&gt;{{rp|26-30,36-37}}

Naimi was born in Ar-Rakah in the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]]. He joined [[Saudi Aramco]] in 1947 as a twelve-year-old office boy. Under the training programs of Aramco, he studied at [[International College, Beirut]] and the [[American University of Beirut]], before going to [[Lehigh University]] in the [[United States]]. He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in [[geology]] in 1962. He then earned a Master of Science degree in [[hydrology]] and economic geology at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name=aps24oct&gt;{{cite news|title=Ali Ibrahim Al Na'imi|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Saudi+Arabia+-+'Ali+Ibrahim+Al-Na'imi.-a0271064013|accessdate=27 March 2013|newspaper=APS Review Oil Market Trends|agency=Arab Press Service|date=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LU&gt;{{cite web |title=Saudi Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ali Al-Naimi to speak at commencement |url=http://www1.lehigh.edu/news/saudi-minister-petroleum-and-mineral-resources-ali-al-naimi-speak-commencement |publisher=Lehigh University |date=8 May 2012 |accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali attended advanced management courses at Columbia in 1974 and Harvard in 1979.&lt;ref name=Ali/&gt;{{rp|111}}

==Career==
After graduation, Naimi joined Aramco's exploration and production department as a geologist in 1964.  He presented his first research paper, The Groundwater of Northeastern Saudi Arabia, in 1965.  In 1967, he spent a year in the public relations department, before being assigned as the senior supervising operator for the [[Abqaiq]] Field in 1968.  There he used an innovative gas injection method to revive the Ain Dar, No. 17, well.  On 1 April 1969, Ali was made superintendent, assistant manager in 1972, and then manager in 1973.&lt;ref name=Ali/&gt;{{rp|76,82-89}} 

He was promoted to manager of [[Northern Borders Region|Northern Area producing]] in 1974, which had responsibility for 11 of Aramco's 15 oil fields.  On 1 May 1975, the Aramco board promoted Ali to be the vice president for producing and water injection.  He was one of the leaders that initiated seawater injection as a replacement for well water.  He was named president of Aramco Overseas Company before becoming a senior vice president in July 1978.&lt;ref name=Ali/&gt;{{rp|93,95-96,105,107-108}} Al Naimi was elected a member of board of directors in 1980 and was promoted to the newly created position of executive vice-president of oil and gas affairs in 1981. He was named president of Saudi Aramco in Nov. 1983,&lt;ref name=samirad&gt;{{cite web |title=Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources |url=http://www.saudinf.com/main/c5121.htm |publisher=SAMIRAD |accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; being the first Saudi to hold that position.  Then in 1988, Al-Naimi assumed responsibilities as [[CEO]].&lt;ref name=Ali/&gt;{{rp|122,143}}

He became the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources on 2 August 1995 (his 60th birthday), replacing [[Hisham Nazer]].&lt;ref name=aps24oct/&gt; Al-Naimi became the first oil executive to hold the office.  He was succeeded by [[Abdullah S. Jum'ah]] as CEO of Aramco.&lt;ref name=Ali/&gt;{{rp|190-194}}

Also in 1995, Naimi received an Honorary Doctorate from [[Heriot-Watt University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hw.ac.uk/services/docs/honorary-graduates-1966-present.pdf |publisher=Heriot-Watt University |title=Honorary Graduates |accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, the Saudi Supreme Petroleum Council, chaired by [[King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]], asked Naimi to nominate candidates to succeed him as oil minister.&lt;ref name=reu10dec&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi considers Naimi's successor as oil minister|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2010/12/10/uk-saudi-oilmin-idUKTRE6B94BG20101210|accessdate=6 March 2013|agency=Reuters|date=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, still serving as Saudi oil minister and therefore the [[de facto]] leader of [[OPEC]], Naimi became the primary advocate for the export organization's controversial new strategy. He argued that the oil market should be left to rebalance itself at lower price levels, strategically rebuilding OPEC's long-term market share by ending the profitability of high-cost US shale oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside OPEC room, Naimi declares price war on US shale oil |agency=Reuters |date=28 November 2014 |accessdate=12 April 2016 |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-opec-meeting-idUKKCN0JB0M420141128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naimi completed his service as oil minister in May 2016, as deputy crown prince [[Mohammed bin Salman]] took on a stronger role in Saudi oil policy.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

This 1831 cartoon ridiculing Clay's American System depicts monkeys, labeled as being different parts of a nation's economy, stealing each other's resources (food) with commentators describing it as either great or a humbug.]]

The '''American System''' was an economic plan that played an important role in [[United States|American]] policy during the [[History of the United States (1789–1849)|first half of the 19th century]]. Rooted in the "[[American School (economics)|American School]]" ideas of [[Alexander Hamilton]], the plan "consisted of three mutually reinforcing parts: a [[tariff]] to protect and promote American industry; a [[National bank#United States|national bank]] to foster commerce; and federal [[subsidy|subsidies]] for roads, canals, and other '[[internal improvements]]' to develop profitable markets for agriculture".{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="senatewebsite"&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Speeches_ClayAmericanSystem.htm Classic Senate Speeches: Henry Clay ''In Defense of the American System''] at the US Senate website&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Congress|Congressman]] [[Henry Clay]] was the plan's foremost proponent and the first to refer to it as the "American System".

==History==

A plan to strengthen and unify the nation, the American System,  was advanced by the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] and a number of leading politicians including [[Henry Clay]], [[John C. Calhoun]] and [[John Quincy Adams]]. The System included such policies as:

* Support for a high [[tariff]] to protect American industries and generate revenue for the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]
* Maintenance of high public land prices to generate [[Internal Revenue Service|federal revenue]]
* Preservation of the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] to stabilize the currency and rein in risky state and local banks
* Development of a system of internal improvements (such as roads and canals) which would knit the nation together and be financed by the tariff and land sales

Clay protested that [[Midwestern United States|the West]], which opposed the tariff, should support it since urban factory workers would be consumers of western foods. In Clay's view, the South (which also opposed high tariffs) should support them because of the ready market for cotton in northern mills. This last argument was the weak link. [[Southern United States|The South]] never strongly supported the American System and had access to plenty of markets for its [[cotton]] exports.

Portions of the American System were enacted by the [[United States Congress]]. The [[Second Bank of the United States]] was rechartered in 1816 for 20 years. High tariffs were first suggested by [[Alexander Hamilton]] in his 1791 [[Report on Manufactures]] but were not approved by Congress until the [[Tariff of 1816]].  Tariffs were subsequently raised until they peaked in 1828 after the so-called [[Tariff of Abominations]]. After the [[Nullification Crisis]] in 1833, tariffs remained the same rate until the Civil War. However, the national system of internal improvements was never adequately funded; the failure to do so was due in part to sectional jealousies and constitutional squabbles about such expenditures.

The American System did not enjoy overall success, however; in 1830, President Jackson rejected a bill which would allow the federal government to purchase stock in the Maysville, Washington, Paris, and Lexington Turnpike Road Company, which had been organized to construct a road linking Lexington and the Ohio River, the entirety of which would be in the state of Kentucky. Jackson's [[Maysville Road veto]] was  due to both his personal conflict with Clay and his ideological objections.

==Main points==

The establishment of a protective tariff, a 20%–25% tax on imported goods, would protect a nation's business from foreign competition.  Congress passed a [[Dallas Tariff|tariff in 1816]] which made European goods more expensive and encouraged consumers to buy relatively cheap American-made goods.

The establishment of a [[national bank]] would promote a single currency, making trade easier, and issue what was called ''[[sovereign credit]]'', i.e., credit issued by the national government, rather than borrowed from the private banking system. In 1816, Congress created the [[Second Bank of the United States]].

The improvement of the country's [[infrastructure]], especially transportation systems, made trade easier and faster for everyone.  Poor roads made transportation slow and costly.

This program became the leading tenet of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] of Henry Clay and [[Daniel Webster]]. It was opposed by the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] of [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Martin Van Buren]], [[James K. Polk]], [[Franklin Pierce]], and [[James Buchanan]]  prior to the Civil War, often on the grounds that the points of it were unconstitutional.

Among the most important internal improvements created under the American System was the [[Cumberland Road]].

{{quote|Henry Clay's "American System," devised in the burst of nationalism that followed [[the War of 1812]], remains one of the most historically significant examples of a government-sponsored program to harmonize and balance the nation's agriculture, commerce, and industry. This "System" consisted of three mutually reinforcing parts: a tariff to protect and promote American industry; a national bank to foster commerce; and federal subsidies for roads, canals, and other "internal improvements" to develop profitable markets for agriculture. Funds for these subsidies would be obtained from tariffs and sales of public lands. Clay argued that a vigorously maintained system of sectional economic interdependence would eliminate the chance of renewed subservience to the [[free-trade]], [[laissez-faire]] "British System."|[[United States Senate]] website&lt;ref name="senatewebsite"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27242">From the independence of the [[United States]] until today, various movements within [[Canada]] have campaigned in favour of U.S. [[annexation]] of parts or all of Canada. Historical studies have focused on numerous small-scale movements which are helpful in comparisons of Canadian and American politics.

In the early years of the United States, many American political figures were in favour of invading and annexing Canada, and even pre-approved Canada's admission to the U.S. in the [[Articles of Confederation]] in 1777. The defeat of American attempts to achieve this goal, both in the [[American Revolution]] and the [[War of 1812]], gradually led to the abandonment in the U.S. of any serious push toward annexation. As historian Joseph Levitt notes:
:Since the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] in 1871, when it first ''de facto'' recognized the new Dominion of Canada, the United States has never suggested or promoted an annexationist movement in Canada. No serious force has appeared on the American political scene that aimed to persuade or coerce Canadians into joining the United States. And, in fact, no serious initiative for any move in this direction has come from the Canadian side either.&lt;ref&gt;Neuhold and Von Riekhoff, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys have suggested that a minority of Canadians would potentially support annexation, ranging from as many as 20 percent in a survey by [[Léger Marketing]] in 2001&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legermarketing.com/documents/SPCLM/010910ENG.pdf Leger Marketing survey, 2001.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020114114/http://www.legermarketing.com/documents/SPCLM/010910ENG.pdf |date=October 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to as few as seven percent in another survey by the same company in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.annexation.ca/reports/2004%20Leger%20Marketing%20-%20Canada%20US%20Relations.pdf Leger Marketing survey, 2004.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219091052/http://www.annexation.ca/reports/2004%20Leger%20Marketing%20-%20Canada%20US%20Relations.pdf |date=2012-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No elected member of any federal or provincial assembly in Canada, nor any mainstream politician in the United States, openly advocates annexation. Two minor provincial political parties in Canada promoted the concept in the 1980s, but neither attracted widespread support or attention.

==Historical annexationist groups==

===1837===
Historical annexationist movements inside Canada were usually inspired by dissatisfaction with Britain's colonial government of Canada. Groups of Irish immigrants took the route of armed struggle, attempting to annex the peninsula between the [[Detroit River|Detroit]] and [[Niagara River]]s to the U.S. by force in the minor and short-lived [[Patriot War]] in 1837-1838.

Although the [[Rebellions of 1837]] were motivated in part by this type of dissatisfaction, Canadian resentment of British rule never reached the degree that led to the [[American Revolution]] in 1775. Notably, Canada's population growth in the late 18th and early 19th centuries was spurred largely by [[United Empire Loyalists]], who left the American colonies during the Revolution because of their loyalty to Great Britain. In the period from 1790 to 1837, imperial officials repeatedly denounced American-style republicanism and tried to suppress it. The Rebellions themselves were not fought with the goal of annexation, however, but were launched in pursuit of political independence from Britain and [[Liberalism|liberal]] social reforms.

Between 1848 and 1854, a significant and articulate minority of conservatives in [[Upper Canada]] advocated constitutional changes modelled on the American federal-state system and the [[Constitution of the United States|US Constitution]]. They critiqued Canada's imitation of [[Westminster System|British parliamentary government]] as both too democratic and too tyrannical. It destroyed the independence of the appointed governor and Legislative Council and further concentrated power in the Cabinet. This critique led many conservatives to argue that the American model of [[checks and balances]] offered Canada a more balanced and conservative form of democracy than did British parliamentary government. These "republican conservatives" debated a series of constitutional changes, including annexation to the United States, an elected governor, an elected Legislative Council, a federal union of [[British North America]], and imperial [[federation]], within this framework. These conservatives had accepted "government by discussion" as the appropriate basis for political order.&lt;ref&gt;McNairn, Jeffrey L. "Publius of the North: Tory Republicanism and the American Constitution in Upper Canada, 1848-54." Canadian Historical Review 1996 77(4): 504-537. ISSN 0008-3755.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1850s===
Around 1850 there was a serious annexationist movement on the border region of Quebec's [[Eastern Townships]], where the American-descended majority felt that union with the United States would end their economic isolation and stagnation as well as remove them from the growing threat of [[French Canadian]] political domination. Leading proponents of this genuinely bipartisan movement were careful not to appear disloyal to Britain, however, and they actively discouraged popular protest at the local level. Fearful of American-style democracy, the local elite also expressed revulsion toward American [[slavery]] and militaristic expansionism. Consequently, the movement died as quickly in the Eastern Townships as it did in Montreal after Britain expressed its official disapproval and trade with the United States began to increase.&lt;ref&gt;Little, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In Montreal at midcentury, with little immigration and complaints that the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] had cut the region off from its British trade links, a small but organized group supported integrating the colonies into the United States.  The leading organization advocating merger was the [[Annexation Association]], founded in 1849 by an alliance of [[French Canadian]] nationalists and Anglophone businessmen in [[Montreal]] who had a common interest in the republic. Many of its members, including [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]], were participants in the 1837-38 rebellions.

The [[Montreal Annexation Manifesto]] was published in 1849. It was hoped a merger with the United States would give Canada markets for its goods, ensure national security, and provide the finances to develop the west. A half measure was the in 1854 [[Canadian-American Reciprocity Treaty]] that linked the two areas economically.

However, the movement died out in 1854. Annexation was never a very popular choice. Many Canadians were loyal to the Crown and Great Britain, especially the descendants of the [[United Empire Loyalists]].  French Canadians worried about being an even smaller minority in a larger union, and were concerned about American anti-Catholicism.  The [[American Civil War]], further, convinced many Canadians that the American experiment was a failure.

===1860s===

====British Columbia====
{{see also|History of British Columbia#Annexation debate}}

[[United States Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] predicted in 1860 that western British North America, from Manitoba to British Columbia, would with [[Russian Alaska]] join the United States. Many in Britain, such as [[Goldwin Smith]] and the ''[[Times of London]]'', were pessimistic about the future of British North America and agreed with Seward; the ''Times'' said that Britain would only object if the United States attempted to take the territory by force.&lt;ref name="jstor3637972"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shi | first1 = David E. | last2 =  | first2 =  | year = 1978 | title = Seward's Attempt to Annex British Columbia, 1865-1869 | journal = Pacific Historical Review | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–238 | publisher =  | doi= 10.2307/3637972 | jstor = 3637972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1860s, residents of [[British Columbia]], which was not yet a Canadian province, responded to the [[Alaska Purchase|United States' purchase of Alaska]] with fear of being surrounded by American territory. Some residents wanted the colony the next American purchase. Local opinion was divided, as the three [[Vancouver Island]] newspapers supported annexation to the United States, while the three mainland newspapers rejected the idea. Even opponents of the annexation scheme admitted that Great Britain had neglected the region and that grievances were justified. Nonetheless, annexation sentiment disappeared within a few months and prominent leaders moved toward confederation with Canada.&lt;ref name="jstor40491056"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/40491056 | last1 = Neunherz | first1 = R. E. | year = 1989 | title = "Hemmed In": Reactions in British Columbia to the Purchase of Russian America | journal = The Pacific Northwest Quarterly | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 101–111 | publisher =  | jstor = 40491056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petitions circulated in favour of American annexation. The first, in 1867, was addressed to [[Queen Victoria]], demanding that the British government assume the colony's debts and establish a steamer link, or allow the colony to join the U.S. In 1869, a second petition was addressed to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]], asking him to negotiate American annexation of the territory from Britain. It was delivered to Grant by [[Vincent Colyer]], [[Indian Commissioner]] for [[Alaska]], on December 29, 1869. Both petitions were signed by only a small fraction of the colony's population, and British Columbia was ultimately admitted as a Canadian province in 1871.

====Nova Scotia====
Most Canadians were strongly opposed to the prospect of American annexation. Reports of the [[Annexation Bill of 1866]] — a bill that, contrary to myth, never came to a vote — might have been one of the many factors behind [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867.  Much more serious were the [[Fenian raids]] made by [[Irish Americans]] across the border in 1866, which spurred a wave of patriotic feeling that helped the cause of Confederation.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Creighton, ''John A. Macdonald: The Young Politician'' 1952 pp 438-43&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, a substantial annexation movement existed in Nova Scotia, and to a lesser degree in New Brunswick, Quebec, and Ontario, during the 1860s. Nova Scotia [[Anti-Confederation Party#Nova Scotia|anti-confederationists]] led by [[Joseph Howe]] felt that pro-confederation premier [[Charles Tupper]] had caused the province to agree to join Canada without popular support. Howe in London unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the government to free Nova Scotia from the pending British North America Act by threatening American annexation. A significant economic downturn occurred after the end after 1866 of the [[Reciprocity Treaty of 1854]]; the colony was heavily dependent on selling fish to Americans, causing many to believe that free trade with the United States was necessary for prosperity. Anti-confederationists won all but two seats in the [[24th General Assembly of Nova Scotia|1867 provincial election]]; as in British Columbia they did not necessarily support annexation. They again sent Howe to London to free Nova Scotia but in 1868 the British government again refused, believing that New Brunswick would likely follow Nova Scotia out of the dominion and cause the new nation to collapse.{{r|warner1960}}

Angry Nova Scotians began talking seriously of annexation. An alarmed Howe&amp;mdash;who wished Nova Scotia to be free of Canada but still with Britain&amp;mdash;warned his supporters against disloyalty, dividing anti-confederationists. The provincial government, dominated by extremists who now also opposed Howe, decided that if another appeal to London failed it would seize federal offices and unilaterally declare annexation, believing that Britain would not use force to stop Nova Scotia. Believing he had no choice, Howe left the anti-confederationists. Although he narrowly won reelection to his federal parliamentary seat in March 1869 as a confederationist, support for secession and annexation grew that year; however, by 1871 the movement had mostly disappeared. The federal government promised changes to taxes and tariffs, the economy revived, and the United States agreed to free trade for Canadian fish.&lt;ref name="warner1960"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.questia.com/read/99340202/the-idea-of-continental-union-agitation-for-the-annexation | title=The Idea of Continental Union: Agitation for the Annexation of Canada to the United States, 1849-1893 | publisher=University of Kentucky Press | author=Warner, Donald F. | year=1960 | pages=54–57, 67–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1880s===
Canadian author Prosper Bender wrote in the ''[[North American Review]]'' in 1883 that many Canadians believed that annexation by the United States would occur "within the present generation, if not sooner". He believed that Irish Catholics&amp;mdash;about one quarter of Canada's population&amp;mdash;would prefer annexation because of the British rule of Ireland. They would be joined by the majority of those under 40, who viewed the United States as a prosperous, fast-growing neighbor providing many opportunities. (The author attributed the absence of an active annexation movement in part to many who would favor such an effort taking the "easiest and quietest method of securing the benefits of annexation, by themselves silently migrating to the Republic", as more than a million already had.)&lt;ref name="jstor25118257"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bender | first1 = P. | last2 =  | first2 =  | year = 1883 | title = A Canadian View of Annexation | journal = The North American Review | volume = 136 | issue = 317 | pages = 326–336 | publisher =  | jstor = 25118257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bender believed that Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]]'s promise of a [[Canadian Pacific Railway|transcontinental railway]] linking eastern Canada to British Columbia to be overambitious and too expensive, and unfavourably compared the Canadian government's growing debt to the United States' rapid reduction of its [[American Civil War|Civil War]] debt. He stated that Canadian businesses would benefit from duty-free access to the American market, while "wondrous American enterprise, supported by illimitable capital" would rapidly prosper Canada, especially its vast undeveloped interior. Bender concluded with pessimism about the likelihood of success of a nation divided in two parts by 1,200 miles of "forbidding, silent wilderness stretching from the head-waters of the [[Ottawa River|Ottawa]] to [[Thunder Bay, Ontario|Thunder Bay]], and thence to [[Manitoba]]".{{r|jstor25118257}}

===1890s===
In 1891, Goldwin Smith posited in his book ''[[Canada and the Canadian Question]]'' that Canada's eventual annexation by the United States was inevitable, and should be welcomed if Canadians genuinely believed in the ideal of [[democracy]]. His view did not receive widespread support.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Stéphane.  "[https://www.thestar.com/comment/article/164488 The Republic of Northern America]." ''[[Toronto Star]]''; Opinion (Canada 2020).  26 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1893, concerned about Canada's possible annexation, a goal then being pursued by the Continental Union Association, a group of Ontario and Quebec Liberals, Prime Minister [[John Sparrow David Thompson|Sir John Thompson]] delivered a speech on tolerance, Canadian nationalism and continued loyalty to Britain. Thompson eventually learned that the desire to make Canada part of the U.S. was confined to a small minority amongst the Liberals.

===1900s===
In 1901 [[W. T. Stead]], a newspaper editor in London, England,  discussed in ''The Americanization of the World'' possible annexations of Canada and Newfoundland. He believed that because of its size and strength Canada would likely be the last of Britain's possessions in the Americas to join the United States. Stead cited several reasons for why he believed annexation seemed "inevitable", however, including rapidly growing economic ties and migration between the two countries, the [[French Shore]], and [[Alaska Boundary Dispute|disputes over the Alaska boundary]] and fishing rights in the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="stead1901"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/americanizationo01stea#page/83/mode/2up | title=The Americanization of the World | publisher=Horace Markley | author=Stead, W. T. | year=1901 | pages=83–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the discovery of gold in the Yukon, many Canadians propose to annex parts of Alaska currently controlled by the United States, by calling for a revision in the original map of the boundary line between Russia and the United States. The US offered to lease the territory but not to give it back. London and Washington agreed on arbitration, with one member of the panel from Canada. In 1903 the Chief Justice of Britain sided with the Americans to resolve the map dispute in favor of the United States.  Many Canadians felt a sense of betrayal on the part of the British government, whose own national interest required close ties to the United States, regardless of the interests of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Gibson, "The Alaskan Boundary Dispute," ''Canadian Historical Association Report'' (1945) pp 25-40 at note 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newfoundland in the mid-twentieth century===
While the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] was still separate from Canada, during [[World War II]], a party known as the [[Economic Union Party]] sought closer ties with the United States. However, Canada objected to the possibility, and the British government, which controlled Newfoundland as a colony, would not allow it to consider annexation with the United States in any referendum. Instead, the EUP sought an independent "responsible government" that would then explore American annexation.&lt;ref&gt;Karl McNeil Earle, "Cousins of a Kind: The Newfoundland and Labrador Relationship with the United States" ''American Review of Canadian Studies,'' Vol. 28, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; A referendum showed a plurality in support of independence, but not a majority; a runoff referendum resulted in Newfoundland instead confederating with Canada to become the [[Newfoundland and Labrador|tenth province]].

==Modern annexationist groups==
Two modern provincial political parties have proposed that their province [[secessionist movements of Canada|secede from Canada]] to join the United States. Neither attracted significant support.

The [[Unionest Party]] was a provincial political party in [[Saskatchewan]] in 1980 that promoted the union of the western provinces with the United States. It was the most politically successful annexationist group, but its success was both short-lived and extremely limited in scope. The party briefly had two members in the [[Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan]], both of whom [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] from another party, but dissolved within a few weeks after failing to qualify for [[official party status]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen LaRose, "It's All About the Crude". ''Planet S'', March 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Parti 51]] was a short-lived political party in [[Quebec]] in the 1980s that advocated Quebec's admission to the United States as the [[51st state]]. The party won just 3,846 votes, or 0.11 per cent of the popular vote in the province, in the [[Quebec general election, 1989|1989 election]] — fewer votes than the [[Parti marxiste-léniniste du Québec|Marxist-Leninists]] or the satirical [[Parti citron|Lemon Party]] — and was dissolved the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Crête, "La vie des partis". ''L'année politique au Québec 1989-1990'', Les Presses de l'Université de Montréal.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Hans Mercier, a pro-American lawyer from [[Saint-Georges, Quebec|Saint-Georges]], Quebec, revived the party for second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L’avocat beauceron Hans Mercier relance le Parti 51|url=http://www.leclaireurprogres.ca/actualites/politique/2017/1/12/l_avocat-beauceron-hans-mercier-relance-le-parti-51-.html|website=L'Éclaireur Progrès|accessdate=28 October 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercier told ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' that the times have changed since the party's previous era, as [[Quebec sovereigntism]] has waned in popularity. Mercier argued that Americans would be welcoming of a new Quebec state, and pointed to a survey taken during the administration of [[George W. Bush]] that suggested nearly 34 per cent of Quebecers would support joining the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Guidara |first1=Amin |title=Voter pour un Québec américain - La Presse+ |url=http://mi.lapresse.ca/screens/db879cf9-2ca5-4cae-ac73-a7812b8e3028__7C___0.html |accessdate=16 September 2018 |work=La Presse+ |publisher=La Presse |date=27 August 2018 |language=fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-annexation rhetoric==
In modern Canadian political discourse, the idea of Canada becoming the "[[51st state]]" of the United States is much more often used as a scare tactic ''against'' political courses of action that may be seen as too "Americanizing". The use of this type of rhetoric may occur even if the proponents of such a course of action have ''not'' endorsed or proposed annexation.

In the [[Canadian federal election, 1911|1911 federal election]], the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historic)|Conservative]] response to the proposed reciprocity treaty negotiated by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] was to denounce it as equivalent to an American economic takeover, with annexation likely to follow. The parties swapped position in the later [[Canadian federal election, 1988|1988 federal election]], when the Liberals used the same type of rhetoric to denounce the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]]' proposed [[Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement]], although the Progressive Conservatives won that election and the agreement was implemented.

Annexation fears can be found throughout ''Canadian History for Dummies'', in which humourist [[Will Ferguson]] stated that for "[[John L. O'Sullivan]], it was the "[[manifest destiny]]" of the United States to annex and possess all of North America".&lt;ref&gt;Will Ferguson, ''Canadian History for Dummies''. pp. 211, 206, 220, 269.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, O'Sullivan's use of the term never extended beyond potential American annexation of [[Texas]] and the [[Oregon Territory]]; he explicitly wrote that he did ''not'' believe that the United States had a destiny to annex Canada.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Morning News'', December 27, 1845.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse annexation==
Political satirists, including the [[Rhinoceros Party of Canada (1963–1993)|Rhinoceros Party of Canada]], have occasionally proposed [[Proposals for new Canadian provinces and territories|reverse annexation]], whereby all or part the United States would be annexed into an expanded Canadian federation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/ff/Judiskucepamphlet2.pdf 1979 campaign brochure of Judi Skuce] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912104752/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/ff/Judiskucepamphlet2.pdf |date=September 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 American election]], some Americans distributed the satirical [[Jesusland map]] on the Internet, depicting a similar proposal under which the [[Red state vs. blue state divide|"blue states"]] were part of a new political entity called "The United States of Canada".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12732">{{Main|Welfare fraud}}

'''Benefit fraud''' is a form of [[welfare fraud]] as found within the system of government benefits paid to individuals by the [[welfare state in the United Kingdom]].

== Definition of benefit fraud ==

The [[Department for Work and Pensions]] (DWP) define benefit fraud as when someone obtains state benefit they are not entitled to or deliberately fails to report a change in their personal circumstances. The DWP claim that fraudulent benefit claims amounted to around £900 million in 2008–09.&lt;ref name="Reporting benefit fraud."&gt;[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/BenefitsTaxCreditsAndOtherSupport/BenefitFraud/DG_10014876 Reporting benefit fraud] at [[Directgov]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common form of benefit fraud is when a person receives benefits, but continues or begins employment. Another common form of fraud is when the receivers of benefits claim that they live alone, but they are financially supported by a partner or spouse.

In 2002, the DWP launched a 'Targeting Benefit Thieves' advertising campaign to spread their message that benefit fraud carried a criminal sanction. The most recent campaign makes claims about the likelihood of getting caught and the consequences of committing benefit fraud using ‘And they thought they’d never be caught’ as the leading slogan.

== Examples of alleged benefit fraud  ==

In recent years the term benefit fraud has been used by the DWP to encompass a wider range of behaviours, beyond simultaneously claiming unemployment benefit whilst working in the informal labour market. Their 2007 'No ifs, No buts' campaign emphasised other activities that could lead to prosecution. This includes failing to inform the state that your partner is now living with you, or that you have moved house, or that a relative has died, leaving you some money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campaigns.dwp.gov.uk/campaigns/benefit-thieves/whatis.asp What is benefit theft?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527142329/http://campaigns.dwp.gov.uk/campaigns/benefit-thieves/whatis.asp |date=May 27, 2011 }} at [[Department for Work and Pensions|DWP]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the introduction of the [[Welfare Reform Act 2007]], councils can now independently investigate a number of Social Security benefits.

== Public opinion on benefit fraud ==
The ''State of the Nation'' report published in 2010 by the [[Premiership of David Cameron|Government of David Cameron]] estimated the total benefit fraud in the United Kingdom in 2009/10 to be approximately £1&amp;nbsp;[[Long and short scales|billion]].&lt;ref name="state-nation-report"&gt;{{cite web|title=State of the nation report: poverty, worklessness and welfare dependency in the UK |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/410872/web-poverty-report.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101207214656/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/410872/web-poverty-report.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-12-07 |publisher=HM Government |accessdate=5 January 2013 |page=34 |date=May 2010 }} Figures quoted as distinct from costs related to error&lt;/ref&gt; Figures from the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] show that benefit fraud is thought to have cost taxpayers £1.2 billion during 2012–13, up 9 per cent on the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Dixon| first =Hayley| title =Majority of benefit cheats not prosecuted, official figures show| newspaper =The Telegraph| date =13 December 2013| url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10515091/Majority-of-benefit-cheats-not-prosecuted-official-figures-show.html| accessdate = 24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll conducted by the [[Trades Union Congress]] in 2012 found that perceptions among the British public were that benefit fraud was high – on average people thought that 27% of the British welfare budget is claimed fraudulently;&lt;ref name="tuc-2012-poll"&gt;{{cite web|title=Support for benefit cuts dependent on ignorance, TUC-commissioned poll finds|url=http://www.tuc.org.uk/social/tuc-21796-f0.cfm|publisher=TUC|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, official UK Government figures have stated that the proportion of fraud stands at 0.7% of the total welfare budget in 2011/12.&lt;ref name="dwp-fraud"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fraud and Error Preliminary 2011/12 Estimates|work=Fraud and Error in the Benefit System: Preliminary 2011/12 Estimates (Great Britain) Revised Edition|publisher=Department for Work and Pensions|page=2|date=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of disproportionality==

The political scientist Adam Taylor claimed that the targeting of  benefit fraud was disproportionate and was evidence of "government using strong-arm tactics on the weakest members of British society": the disabled and the poor.&lt;ref name=taxing&gt;Adam Taylor, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/10/comment.society A taxing problem], ''[[Comment is Free]]'', 10 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor argued that the amount of money lost to false benefit claims was small compared to the huge amount lost to [[tax fraud]] which he estimated as costing the UK economy £150bn (this compares to the [[HMRC]] estimate of £4.1bn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/364009/4382_Measuring_Tax_Gaps_2014_IW_v4B_accessible_20141014.pdf |title=Measuring tax gaps 2014 edition |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703142859/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/364009/4382_Measuring_Tax_Gaps_2014_IW_v4B_accessible_20141014.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), yet he believed that comparatively little and in most cases nothing at all was done to pursue corporate tax evaders who defraud the people of the UK. Taylor argued that the crucial difference between these two practices is that "the former is committed by the weakest and most vulnerable of society, while the far more damaging crime is being committed by the richest (and the most corrupt traitors) in the UK."&lt;ref name=taxing/&gt;

== Assessment of benefit fraud assessed ==

A benefit fraudster is extremely unlikely to be investigated unless some third party reports them to, and provides evidence to, the police or the Job Centre (i.e. they slip up and admit it, or if they act in a particularly suspicious manner during a routine encounter with Job Centre staff, perhaps taking work telephone calls while at a signing-on appointment). That is to say that the two key reasons for investigating someone are:

*Because they are reported by someone who has evidence they are committing fraud.
*Because they accidentally give away to the Job Centre evidence of their own fraud.
&lt;!--While there has been publicity that the DWP are able to use electronic means ([[data mining]]) to identify fraud, there does not appear to be any evidence that they are able to manipulate their own data in such a way as to identify fraud effectively. Such system, were it to be effective, would cost well in excess of total benefit fraud, which is only 0.7% of the welfare budget. *This is incorrect and one of the main methods of identifying fraudsters is actually data matching from other agencies i.e. the tax office.--&gt;

When investigating cases, Fraud Officers will collect facts and a decision will be made on whether or not to take further action. They may gather information about the claimant and their family members, then compare it with information already given on claim forms or in interviews.&lt;ref name="Direct Gov website"&gt;[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/BenefitsTaxCreditsAndOtherSupport/BenefitFraud/DG_10035820 What happens if you are suspected of benefit fraud] at Directgov&lt;/ref&gt;

Officers can contact private and public organisations that hold information on a suspected benefit thief including banks, building societies, utility providers. If evidence is found that benefit fraud has been committed, any of the following may happen:

* [[prosecution]]
* pay a penalty as an alternative to prosecution
* the benefit may be reduced or withdrawn
* overpaid benefit will have to be paid back
* confiscation of homes and possessions

== Benefit fraud abroad ==

Some UK benefits can not be claimed when people go abroad. Between April 2008 and March 2009 it is estimated that £55 million was lost as a result of benefit fraud overpayments to British claimants who did not tell the authorities they were living or travelling abroad.

== Penalties ==

When someone is caught for benefit fraud there are three key 'sanctions' that DWP or the Council can apply. These are formal cautions, administrative penalties and prosecution. By section 121&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/5/section/121/enacted  section 121] of the Welfare Reform Act 2012&lt;/ref&gt; of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 from 8 May 2012 cautions will no longer be offered by DWP.

The main criterion for the offering of a caution is that the person has to have admitted that they have committed an offence. Other than this criterion, there is no statutory framework regulating which sanction is used in disposal of a case. This is a matter of policy for the relevant authority. The Department for Work and Pensions has a national policy; each Local Authority will have its own Policy which will set different criteria and financial guidelines.

The Administrative Penalty is effectively a fine and is set at 30% or 50% of the total amount overpaid to them (the percentage applied is dependent upon when the overpayment period commenced - overpayments occurring wholly on or after 08.05.2012 incur a 50% fine). 
This figure is set in section 115A(3) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/47/section/15 s115A] Security Administration Act 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Security Administration Act 1992 there is no negotiation on this. In addition to this, benefit thieves also need to pay back all of the money they deliberately defrauded. The suspect does not have to admit their guilt to be offered an Administrative Penalty, however it should only be offered by the Department for Work and Pensions, or the Local Authority if they believe there is sufficient evidence for court proceedings to be considered if the offer is refused.

Prosecution may typically occur in England &amp; Wales using the [[Social Security Administration Act 1992]], or under the [[Theft Act 1978]], or the [[Fraud Act 2006]]; in Northern Ireland under corresponding legislation; or in Scotland under Common Law Fraud. A Prosecution is brought when the value of the overpaid benefit is so great, or the period of the fraud is lengthy, or the person may have been in a [[position of trust]], or the fraud was very blatant. Any prosecution brought by the Department for Work and Pensions or a Local Authority should have been subject to the Public Interest Test as set out in the Code of Practice for Crown Prosecutors. In Scotland cases of benefit fraud are reported to the Procurator Fiscal for prosecution.

== Prosecution – legal points ==
Where cases of benefit fraud result in criminal prosecution, in England &amp; Wales such prosecutions are generally brought either under section 112 [[Social Security Administration Act 1992]] (where no dishonesty is alleged) or under s111A of the same Act (where [[dishonesty]] is alleged).  There are a number of legal cases relevant to prosecutions under these sections.  Key points are dealt with in more detail in technical articles on benefit fraud.&lt;ref&gt;David Winch, [http://www.accountingevidence.com/documents/articles/Benefit%20fraud1.pdf "Benefit fraud"] (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The penalties for benefit fraud may be mitigated where it can be shown that the defendant would have been entitled to other forms of financial benefit, such as UK Tax Credits, had an appropriate claim on the true facts been lodged at the time.

A person convicted of benefit fraud may be held to have a 'criminal lifestyle' in confiscation proceedings under Parts 2, 3 &amp; 4 of the [[Proceeds of Crime Act 2002]].

[[File:Shiva amplifier chains.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In 1977 the completion of the [[Shiva laser]] at [[LLNL]] ushered in a new field of big science: [[laser fusion]].]]

'''Big science''' is a term used by [[scientists]] and [[history of science and technology|historians of science]] to describe a series of changes in [[science]] which occurred in [[industrial nations]] during and after [[World War II]], as scientific progress increasingly came to rely on large-scale projects usually funded by national governments or groups of governments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/big%20science "big science"], Merriam-Webster&lt;/ref&gt; Individual or small group efforts, or [[Small Science]], are still relevant today as theoretical results by individual authors may have a significant impact, but very often the empirical verification requires experiments using constructions, such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]], costing between $5 and $10 billion.

== Development ==
{{see also|Military funding of science}}
While science and technology have always been important to and driven by [[war]]fare, the increase in military funding of science following the second World War was on a scale wholly unprecedented.  [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]], in a 1941 letter to ''Chemical Engineering News'', said that World War II "is a physicist's war rather than a chemist's,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Nature |volume=523 |issue=7562 |pages=523&amp;ndash;525 |title=History: From blackboards to bombs |first=David |last=Kaiser |authorlink=David Kaiser |date=28 July 2015 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/history-from-blackboards-to-bombs-1.18056 |doi=10.1038/523523a |pmid=26223611|bibcode=2015Natur.523..523K }}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase that was cemented in the vernacular in post-war discussion of the role that those scientists played in the development of new weapons and tools, notably the [[proximity fuze]], [[radar]], and the [[atomic bomb]].  The bulk of these last two activities took place in a new form of research facility: the government-sponsored laboratory, employing thousands of technicians and scientists, managed by [[university|universities]] (in this case, the [[University of California]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]).

In the shadow of the first atomic weapons, the importance of a strong scientific research establishment was apparent to any country wishing to play a major role in international politics. After the success of the [[Manhattan Project]], governments became the chief patron of science, and the character of the scientific establishment underwent several key changes. This was especially marked in the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]], but also to a lesser extent in many other countries.

== Definitions ==

"Big science" usually implies one or more of these specific characteristics:
*''Big budgets'': No longer required to rely on [[philanthropy]] or [[industry]], scientists were able to use budgets on an unprecedented scale for basic research.
*''Big staffs'': Similarly, the number of practitioners of science on any one project grew as well, creating difficulty, and often controversy, in the assignment of credit for scientific discoveries (the [[Nobel Prize]] system, for example, allows awarding only three individuals in any one topic per year, based on a 19th-century model of the scientific enterprise).
*''Big machines'': [[Ernest Lawrence]]'s [[cyclotron]] at his [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory]] in particular ushered in an era of massive machines (requiring massive staffs and budgets) as the tools of basic scientific research. The use of ''many'' machines, such as the many sequencers used during the [[Human Genome Project]], might also fall under this definition.
[[File:Fermilab.jpg|thumb|right|Enormous [[superconducting]] [[synchrotron]] particle accelerators with circumferences of many kilometers are the exemplars of Big Science. Shown above is the [[Fermilab]] [[Tevatron]].]]
*''Big laboratories'': Because of the increase in cost to do basic science (with the increase of large machines), centralization of scientific research in large laboratories (such as [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] or [[CERN]]) has become a cost-effective strategy, though questions over facility access have become prevalent.

Towards the end of the 20th century, not only projects in basic physics and astronomy, but also in [[life sciences]] became big sciences, such as the massive [[Human Genome Project]]. The heavy investment of government and industrial interests into academic science has also blurred the line between public and private research, where entire academic departments, even at public universities, are often financed by private companies.  Not all Big Science is related to the military concerns which were at its origins.

== Criticism ==

The era of Big Science has provoked criticism that it undermines the basic principles of the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alvin M. Weinberg]], director of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], writing in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1961, quoted in Stefan Theil, "Trouble in Mind: Two years in, a $1-billion-plus effort to simulate the human brain is in disarray. Was it poor management, or is something fundamentally wrong with Big Science?", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased government funding has often meant increased [[military funding of science|military funding]], which some claim subverts the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era ideal of science as a pure quest for knowledge.  For example, historian [[Paul Forman]] has argued that during [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]], the massive scale of defense-related funding prompted a shift in physics from basic to applied research.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Paul.  "Behind quantum electronics: National security as basis for physical research in the United States, 1940-1960," ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 18, Pt. 1, 1987, pp 149-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scientists also complain that the requirement for increased funding makes a large part of the scientific activity filling out grant requests and other budgetary bureaucratic activity, and the intense connections between academic, governmental, and industrial interests have raised the question of whether scientists can be completely objective when their research contradicts the interests and intentions of their benefactors.

In addition, widespread sharing of scientific knowledge is necessary for rapid progress for both basic and applied sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Kolata, Gina. (12 August 2010) "Sharing of Data Leads to Progress on Alzheimer’s" ''New York Times'', retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/13/health/research/13alzheimer.html&lt;/ref&gt; However the sharing of data can be impeded for a number of reasons. For example, scientific findings can be classified by military interests or patented by corporate ones. Grant competitions, while they stimulate interest in a topic, can also increase secretiveness among scientists because application evaluators may value uniqueness more than incremental, collaborative inquiry.

Big Science is labelled as [[antifragile|fragile]] by essayist [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] in his books.

== Historiography of Big Science ==

The popularization of the term "Big Science" is usually attributed to an article by [[Alvin M. Weinberg]], then director of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alvin M. |last=Weinberg |title=Impact of Large-Scale Science on the United States |journal=Science |volume= 134 |issue= 3473 |date=21 July 1961 | doi=10.1126/science.134.3473.161  |pages= 161–164 |jstor=1708292|bibcode = 1961Sci...134..161W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a response to [[wikisource:Eisenhower's farewell address|Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell address]], in which the departing U.S. president warned against the dangers of what he called the "[[military-industrial complex]]" and the potential "domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money".&lt;ref&gt;Steven Shapin, ''The Scientific Life: A Moral History of a Late Modern Vocation''.  Chicago: Chicago University Press, 2008, p. 81.  {{ISBN|0-226-75024-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Weinberg compared the large-scale enterprise of science in the 20th century to the wonders of earlier civilization (the [[pyramids]], the [[palace of Versailles]]):
:''When history looks at the 20th century, she will see science and technology as its theme; she will find in the monuments of Big Science—the huge rockets, the high-energy accelerators, the high-flux research reactors—symbols of our time just as surely as she finds in Notre Dame a symbol of the Middle Ages. ... We build our monuments in the name of scientific truth, they built theirs in the name of religious truth; we use our Big Science to add to our country's prestige, they used their churches for their cities' prestige; we build to placate what ex-President Eisenhower suggested could become a dominant scientific caste, they built to please the priests of Isis and Osiris.''
Weinberg's article addressed criticisms of the way in which the era of Big Science could negatively affect science — such as astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]]'s contention that excessive money for science would only make science fat and lazy — and encouraged, in the end, limiting Big Science only to the [[national laboratory]] system and preventing its incursion into the university system.

Since Weinberg's article there have been many historical and sociological studies on the effects of Big Science both in and out of the laboratory.  Soon after that article, [[Derek J. de Solla Price]] gave a series of lectures that were published in 1963 as ''[[Little Science, Big Science]]''.  The book describes the historical and sociological transition from "small science" to "big science" and the qualitative differences between the two; it inspired the field of [[scientometrics]] as well as new perspectives on large-scale science in other fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1177/0961000603352006| volume = 35| issue = 2| pages = 115–125| last = Furner| first = Jonathan| title = Little Book, Big Book: Before and After Little Science, Big Science: A Review Article, Part I| journal = Journal of Librarianship and Information Science| accessdate = 2009-01-05| date = 2003-06-01| url = http://lis.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/35/2/115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harvard historian Peter Galison has written several books addressing the formation of big science. Major themes include the evolution of experimental design, from table-top experiments to today's large-scale collider projects; accompanying changes in standards of evidence; and discourse patterns across researchers whose expertise only partially overlaps. Galison introduced the notion of "trading zones," borrowed from the sociolinguistic study of [[pidgin]]s, to characterize how such groups learn to interact.

Other historians have postulated many "precursors" to Big Science in earlier times: the [[Uraniborg]] of [[Tycho Brahe]] (in which massive astronomical instruments were made, often with little practical purpose) and the large [[cryogenics]] laboratory established by [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] in 1904 have been cited as early examples of Big Science.&lt;ref&gt;For references to Tycho's work as Big Science, see John Robert Christianson, ''On Tycho's Island: Tycho Brahe and His Assistants, 1570-1601'' (New York, Cambridge University Press: 2000). For references to Kamerlingh Onnes as Big Science, see "Physics at Low Temperatures" in Helge Kragh, ''Quantum Generations: A History of Physics in the Twentieth Century'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1999): 74-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Crown Council of Ethiopia''' was the [[Constitutional Law|constitutional body]] within the [[Ethiopian Empire]], which advised the reigning [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] ([[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]]: ንጉሠ ነገሥት, ''Nəgusä Nägäst''). It also acted on behalf of the Crown.&lt;!-- is this stated in either the 1931 or 1955 constitutions? --&gt; The council’s members were appointed by the Emperor.

The Communist [[Derg]] deposed the last Emperor, [[Haile Selassie|Haile Selassie I]] on 12 September 1974, and dissolved the Council. Most members of the Council were imprisoned and executed, including its president, Prince [[Asrate Medhin Kassa]]. The Derg announced that the monarchy had been abolished early in the following year. However, in 1993, a new Crown Council — which included several descendants of the late Haile Selassie I — asserted that the title of Emperor of Ethiopia was still in existence, and the Crown Council would act in its interests. Its justification was that the abolition of the monarchy by the Derg was extra-constitutional and carried out illegally.

The Federal [[1995 Constitution of Ethiopia|Constitution of 1995]] confirmed the status of the country as a republic, but Ethiopian royalists continue to operate the Crown Council. The Ethiopian government has however continued to accord members of the Imperial family their princely titles as a matter of courtesy. On 16 March 2005, Prince [[Ermias Sahle Selassie]] was reaffirmed by his second cousin [[Zera Yacob Amha Selassie, Crown Prince of Ethiopia|Prince Zera Yacob]] as the President of the Crown Council of Ethiopia. Prince Zera Yacob is considered to be the [[Crown Prince]] of Ethiopia.&lt;ref name = "Council"&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/CrownCouncil.pdf The Crown Council]&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 28, 2004, the Crown Council redefined its role by redirecting its mission from the political realm to a mission of cultural preservation, development and humanitarian efforts in Ethiopia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4362">'''David Blume''' is an American [[permaculture]] teacher and entrepreneur. He has been an especially prolific public speaker, and is a vocal advocate for production of ethanol fuel, especially at local, small and medium scales.

==Major work==

Blume is the author of ''Alcohol Can Be A Gas!'', a review of the history of alcohol used as a fuel, together with an extensive investigation of how to produce alcohol fuel from different crops, using a variety of tools and techniques, and with an explanation of relevant laws and industry practices. The focus of the book is on how to set up and run crops and facilities for local [[ethanol]] use, as opposed to large-scale industrial or commercial use.

The book was originally written in 1983 for release with ''[[Alcohol as Fuel (TV series)|Alcohol as Fuel]]'', a 10-episode how-to series on [[PBS]] produced by [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] in [[San Francisco]]. Copies of the original book and TV series, which was only aired on KQED, have since been nearly impossible to obtain. The book was rewritten and expanded to 640 pages over several years and re-released with the same title on November 1, 2007.

Blume's primary insight follows from that of [[Buckminster Fuller]], who wrote the foreword to the book in 1983: that [[alcohol]] (or [[ethanol]]) is a renewable variety of solar energy in liquid form, the cultivation of which can enhance soils, be used as a minimally- or non-polluting fuel, and enable farmers and individuals at large to make fuel locally.

== Other projects ==
At one time or another Blume has been involved in the following projects.

* Employed by [[NASA]] (1978), at an experimental solar self-sufficient energy, sewage treatment, [[desalinization]] plant in the [[Virgin Islands]].
* Employed by [[Mother Earth News]] Eco Village in [[North Carolina]], part of team practicing [[natural building|alternative building]] techniques.
* Founder, American Homegrown Fuel Co., an educational organization teaching farmers and others how to produce and use alcohol fuel.
* Founder, Planetary Movers Inc (1984).
* Board member, field worker, Ecosites International.
* Board member, field worker, Vivamos Mejor (1990).
* Board member, Committee for Sustainable Agriculture (aka Ecological Farming Association).
* Executive director, {{convert|1600|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Hidden Villa]] Farm and Wilderness Preserve.
* Founder (1993), executive director, International Institute for Ecological Agriculture, [[Santa Cruz, CA]].
* Founder, Our Farm, a [[Community-supported agriculture|CSA]] formerly in [[Woodside, CA]].

{{Politics of South Africa}}

The '''Deputy President of South Africa''' is the deputy head of government of [[South Africa]]. They are a member of the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] and the [[Cabinet of South Africa |Cabinet]]. The Deputy President is constitutionally required to "assist the President in the execution of the functions of government", and may be assigned any government portfolio by presidential proclamation. The Deputy President performs the duties of the [[President of South Africa]] when the President is outside the country's borders, unable to fulfill the duties of the office, or when the Presidency is vacant.

Under the interim constitution (valid from 1994 to 1996), there was a [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|Government of National Unity]], in which a member of parliament from the largest opposition party was entitled to a position as deputy president. Along with Mbeki, the previous State President, [[F. W. de Klerk]] also served as Deputy President in his capacity as the leader of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], then the second-largest party in the new Parliament. De Klerk later resigned and went into opposition with his party. A voluntary coalition government continues to exist under the new constitution (adopted in 1996), although there have been no appointments of opposition politicians to the post of deputy president.

The official living residences of the Deputy President are Oliver Tambo House in Pretoria, Highstead in Cape Town and Dr John L Dube House in Durban.

==Inception and expiry of term==
[[Image:Union Buildings Pretoria.jpg|thumb|The Union Buildings in Pretoria is the seat of the South African Presidency.]]
The Deputy President's term of office is not fixed by law. The Deputy President's term begins when he or she is appointed by the President from amongst members of the National Assembly and takes a prescribed oath. 

The Deputy President's term is ended by one of four constitutional mechanisms: dismissal by the President, a successful 'motion of no confidence in the President' by the National Assembly, a successful 'motion of no confidence excluding the President' by the National Assembly, or a newly elected President's assumption of office. Presumably, a statement of resignation would also be sufficient to end a Deputy President's term of office.

===Informal Roles===
Depending on the extent of any informal roles and functions of the Deputy President  depend on the specific relationship between the president and deputy president, but often the roles include tasks like:
*Spokesperson for the administration policies 
*Adviser to the president.
*Step up when the president is out of the country

==History==

Hoessein Djajadiningrat with their wives, Ratu Timur and Partini, as well as their children (circa 1922).]]

The family is of [[Baduy people|Baduy]] and [[Bantenese people|Bantenese]] extraction. According to Nina Consuelo Epton, the family's oral history recounts that in the middle of the seventeenth century, their ancestor, the renegade son of a Baduy chieftain, sought shelter at the court of the [[Sultan of Banten]].&lt;ref name="Epton 1974" /&gt; He was subsequently admitted into the inner circle of the Sultan's court and was allowed to marry one of the Sultan's daughters, thereby becoming the founder of the Djajadiningrat family.&lt;ref name="Epton 1974" /&gt;

Later marriages into the Javanese reigning dynasties further cemented the Djajadiningrat family's hold on power, as was shown by the career of R. T. A. Natadiningrat and his eldest son, R. T. Sutadiningrat, who both ruled in succession as Regents of Serang.&lt;ref name="Kartodirdjo 2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kartodirdjo |first1=Sartono |title=The Peasants’ Revolt of Banten in 1888: Its Conditions, Course and Sequel: A Case Study of Social Movements in Indonesia |date=2014 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9789401575430 |pages=85–86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BRJCAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=djajadiningrat+family&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=8 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was succeeded by his younger brother, the progressive Raden Bagus Djajawinata.&lt;ref name="Kartodirdjo 2014" /&gt;

[[File:Enrico Berlinguer.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Enrico Berlinguer]], one of the founders of Eurocommunism]]

'''Eurocommunism''' was a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] trend in the 1970s and 1980s within various Western European communist parties. They claimed to be developing a theory and practice of social transformation more relevant for Western Europe. During the [[Cold War]], they sought to undermine the influence of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. It was especially prominent in Italy, Spain and France.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Kingsley, ed., ''In Search of Eurocommunism,'' (Macmillan, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The origin of the term "Eurocommunism" was subject to great debate in the mid-1970s, being attributed to [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] and [[Arrigo Levi]], among others. [[Jean-François Revel]] once wrote that "one of the favourite amusements of 'political scientists' is to search for the author of the term Eurocommunism". In April 1977, ''[[Deutschland Archiv]]'' decided that the word was first used in the summer of 1975 by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] journalist Frane Barbieri, former editor of [[Belgrade]]'s ''[[NIN (magazine)|NIN]]'' newsmagazine. Outside Western Europe, it is sometimes referred to as "neocommunism". This theory stresses greater "independence".&lt;ref name="Definition of Eurocommunism"&gt;{{cite web|last=Webster|first=Dictionary|title=Definition of Eurocommunism|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eurocommunism|work=Dictionary Entry|publisher=Webster's Dictionary|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Theoretical foundation and inspirations===
According to Perry Anderson, the main theoretical foundation of Eurocommunism was [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s writing about Marxist theory&lt;ref&gt;Perry Anderson, 1976. The Antinomies of Antonio Gramsci. New Left Review., pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; which questioned the [[sectarianism]] of the left and encouraged communist parties to develop social alliances to win [[Cultural hegemony|hegemonic]] support for social reforms. Early inspirations can also be found in [[Austromarxism|Austro-Marxism]] and its seeking of a "third" democratic "way" to socialism.

Eurocommunist parties expressed their fidelity to democratic institutions more clearly than before and attempted to widen their appeal by embracing [[public sector]] middle-class workers, [[new social movements]] such as [[feminism]] and [[gay liberation]] and more publicly questioning the Soviet Union. However, Eurocommunism did not go as far as the Anglosphere-centred [[New Left]] movement, which had originally borrowed from the French ''nouvelle gauche'', but in the course of the events went past their academic theorists, largely abandoning Marxist [[historical materialism]], [[class struggle]] and its traditional institutions such as [[Communist party|communist parties]].

===The legacy of the Prague Spring===

[[File:Helsinki demonstration against the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.jpg|thumb|"Viva Dubček" – demonstration against the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]], 1968 in Helsinki]]
The [[Prague Spring]] and particularly its [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|crushing by the Soviet Union]] in 1968 became a turning point for the communist world. [[Romania]]'s leader [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] [[Ceaușescu's speech of 21 August 1968|staunchly criticized the Soviet invasion in a speech]], explicitly declaring his support for the Czechoslovakian leadership under [[Alexander Dubček]], and while the communist parties of [[Portuguese Communist Party|Portugal]], [[South African Communist Party|South Africa]] and the [[Communist Party USA|United States]] supported the Soviet position,&lt;ref name=hitchens /&gt; the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) and the [[Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) firmly denounced the occupation.&lt;ref name=hitchens&gt;{{cite web|title=The Verbal Revolution. How the Prague Spring broke world communism's main spring|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Hitchens|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2008/08/the_verbal_revolution.html|date=25 August 2008|accessdate=2015-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the leadership of the [[Communist Party of Finland]]&lt;ref name=tuomioja&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tuomioja.org/puheet/2008/12/the-effects-of-the-prague-spring-in-europe-2-6-2008/|last=Tuomioja|first=Erkki|authorlink=Erkki Tuomioja|title=The Effects of the Prague Spring in Europe|year=2008|accessdate=2015-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Communist Party of France]] (PCF), which had pleaded for conciliation, expressed their disapproval about the Soviet intervention,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Devlin|first=Kevin|publisher=Open Society Archives|title = Western CPs Condemn Invasion, Hail Prague Spring|url=http://osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/22-4-11.shtml|accessdate =10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the PCF thereby publicly criticizing a Soviet action for the first time in its history.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE) suffered a major split over the internal disputes regarding the Prague Spring,&lt;ref name=hitchens /&gt; with the pro-Dubček faction breaking ties with the Soviet leadership and founding the [[Communist Party of Greece (Interior)|KKE Interior]]. The usually very pro-Soviet [[Communist Party of Ireland]] initially condemned the invasion, but later changed their stance, resulting in the short-lived Eurocommunist split the [[Irish Marxist Society]].

==Early developments==

===Developments in Western European Communist parties===
[[File:Presidente Napolitano.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Giorgio Napolitano]], prominent figure of the [[Italian Communist Party]] (until 1991) and [[President of Italy]] from 2006 to 2015]]
Some communist parties with strong popular support, notably the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) and the [[Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) adopted Eurocommunism most enthusiastically. The [[Communist Party of Finland]] was dominated by Eurocommunists. In the 1980s, the traditional, pro-Soviet faction broke away, calling the main party revisionist.  At least one mass party, the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), as well as many smaller parties strongly opposed to Eurocommunism and stayed aligned to the positions of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] until the end of the Soviet Union (although the PCF did make a brief turn toward Eurocommunism in the mid-to-late 1970s).

The PCE and its [[Catalonia|Catalan]] referent, the [[Partit Socialista Unificat de Catalunya|United Socialist Party of Catalonia]], had already been committed to the liberal possibilist politics of the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The leader of the PCE, [[Santiago Carrillo]], wrote Eurocommunism's defining book ''Eurocomunismo y estado'' (''[[Eurocommunism and the State]]'') and participated in the development of the liberal democratic constitution as Spain emerged from the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]. The communist parties of [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Great Britain]], Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria also turned Eurocommunist.&lt;ref name="bu"/&gt;

The PCI in particular had been developing an independent line from Moscow for many years prior, which had already been exhibited in 1968, when the party refused to support the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion of Prague]]. In 1975, the PCI and the PCE had made a declaration regarding the "march toward socialism" to be done in "peace and freedom". In 1976, Berlinguer had spoken of a "pluralistic system" (''"sistema pluralistico"'' translated by the interpreter as "multiform system") in Moscow and in front of 5,000 communist delegates described PCI's intentions to build "a socialism that we believe necessary and possible only in Italy". The [[Historic Compromise|''compromesso storico'']] ("historic compromise") with [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|''Democrazia Cristiana'']], stopped by the [[Kidnapping of Aldo Moro|kidnapping and murder of Aldo Moro]] in 1978, was a consequence of this new policy.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Fasanaro,  "The Eurocommunism Years: Italy’s Political Puzzle and the Limits of the Atlantic Alliance.”." in Giles Scott-Smith, ed., ''Atlantic, Euratlantic or Europe-America?: The Atlantic Community and the European Idea from Kennedy to Nixon'' (2011): 548-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Communist Party of Finland changed its leadership already in 1965 with leadership post changing from the Stalinist [[Aimo Aaltonen]], who had even a picture of [[Berija]] in his office, to a "revisionist", quite popular Trade Union man, [[Aarne Saarinen]]. The same happened and even more drastically when [[Finnish People's Democratic League]] changed its leadership also, with the reformist [[Ele Alenius]] leading it. In 1968 CPFI (and) FPDL were the only parties to directly oppose the actions of the Soviet militarship in [[Prague]] in 1968, thus the two organizations split ''de facto'' into two different parties, one reformist and one hard-line Soviet. What was peculiar was that the Youth was nearly completely Taistolaist.{{Dubious |Taistolaiset|reason=No scholar would accept this claim|date=June 2016}} Progress was hard to make as the party accorded that the Taistolaist strongly pro-Soviet movement named after their leader, [[Taisto Sinisalo]], had equal rights of power in the party though it was a minority and the vast majority of the CPFI/FPDL was Eurocommunist. In 1984, with a strong Eurocommunist majority the PCFI hard-line organizations were massively expelled from the already weakened party. Pro-Soviet hard-liners formed their own cover-organization, "Democratic Movement". In 1990, the new [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] integrated the CPFI/FPDL, but FPDL:s ex secretary Alenius chose not to be member of it because they also took hard-line Taistolaists.

Western European communists came to Eurocommunism via a variety of routes. For some, it was their direct experience of [[feminism|feminist]] and similar action while for others it was a reaction to the political events of the Soviet Union at the apogee of what [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] later called the [[Era of Stagnation]]. This process was accelerated after the events of 1968, particularly the crushing of the [[Prague Spring]]. The politics of [[détente]] also played a part. With war less likely, Western communists were under less pressure to follow Soviet orthodoxy yet also wanted to engage with a rise in western proletarian militancy such as Italy's [[Hot Autumn]] and Britain's [[shop steward|shop steward's movement]].

==Further development==
Eurocommunism was in many ways only a staging ground for changes in the political structure of the European left. Some – principally the Italians – became [[Social democracy|social democrats]] while others like the Dutch [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|CPN]] moved into [[green politics]] and the French party during the 1980s reverted to a more pro-Soviet stance.

Eurocommunism became a force across Europe in 1977, when [[Enrico Berlinguer]] of the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI), [[Santiago Carrillo]] of the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) and [[Georges Marchais]] of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) met in Madrid and laid out the fundamental lines of the "new way".

Eurocommunist ideas won at least partial acceptance outside of Western Europe. Prominent parties influenced by it outside of Europe were the [[Movement towards Socialism (Venezuela)|Movement for Socialism]] ([[Venezuela]]), the [[Japanese Communist Party]], the [[Mexican Communist Party]] and the [[Communist Party of Australia]].&lt;ref name="bu"&gt;Bucharin, N. I. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=J5QyjJD3h4wC&amp;pg=PR21 Selected Writings on the State and the Transition to Socialism]''. Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 1982. p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; Mikhail Gorbachev also refers to eurocommunism as a key influence on the ideas of ''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]'' in his memoirs.

===Dissolution===
The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|breakup of the Soviet Union]] and the end of the [[Cold War]] put practically all leftist parties in Europe on the defensive and made [[neoliberal]] reforms the order of the day. Many Eurocommunist parties split, with the right factions (such as [[Democrats of the Left|Democratici di Sinistra]] or [[Iniciativa per Catalunya]]) adopting social democracy more whole-heartedly, while the left strove to preserve some identifiably communist positions ([[Communist Refoundation Party]] in Italy or [[PSUC viu]]/[[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]]).

==Criticism==
Two main criticisms have been advanced against Eurocommunism. First, it is alleged by critics that Eurocommunists showed a lack of courage in definitively breaking off from the Soviet Union (for example, the Italian Communist Party took this step only in 1981 after the repression of [[Solidarność]] in Poland). This "timidity" has been explained as the fear of losing old members and supporters, many of whom admired the Soviet Union, or with a ''[[realpolitik]]'' desire to keep the support of a strong and powerful country.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Kindersley, ed., ''In search of Eurocommunism'' (Springer, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics point out the difficulties the Eurocommunist parties had in developing a clear and recognisable strategy.&lt;ref name="Deutscher pp. 78"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Deutscher | first = Tamara | author-link = Tamara Deutscher | title = E. H. Carr—A Personal Memoir | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = I | issue = 137 | pages = 78–86 | publisher = New Left Review | date = January–February 1983 | url = http://newleftreview.org/I/137/tamara-deutscher-e-h-carr-a-personal-memoir | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; They observe that Eurocommunists have always claimed to be different – not only from Soviet communism, but also from social democracy – while in practice they were always very similar to at least one of these two tendencies. Critics thus argue that Eurocommunism does not have a well-defined identity and cannot be regarded as a separate movement in its own right.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

From a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] point of view, [[Ernest Mandel]] in ''From Stalinism to Eurocommunism: The Bitter Fruits of 'Socialism in One Country'{{'}}'' views Eurocommunism as a subsequent development of the decision taken by the Soviet Union in 1924 to abandon the goal of [[world revolution]] and concentrate on social and economic development of the Soviet Union, the doctrine of "[[socialism in one country]]". According to this vision, the Eurocommunists of the Italian and French communist parties are considered to be nationalist movements, who together with the Soviet Union abandoned [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]].

From an [[Anti-revisionism|anti-revisionist]] point of view, [[Enver Hoxha]] in ''Eurocommunism is Anti-Communism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/euroco/env2-1.htm ''Eurocommunism is Anti-Communism'']&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Eurocommunism is the result of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s policy of [[peaceful coexistence]]. Khrushchev was accused of being a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] who encouraged conciliation with the [[bourgeoisie]] rather than adequately calling for its overthrow by the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. He also stated that the Soviet Union's refusal to reject [[Palmiro Togliatti]]'s [[theory]] of [[wikt:polycentric|polycentrism]] encouraged the various [[Soviet Union|pro-Soviet]] communist parties to moderate their views in order to join [[Cabinet (government)|cabinets]], which in turn forced them to abandon [[Marxism–Leninism]] as their leading ideology.

More generally, from the point of view of most revolutionary left-wing movements Eurocommunism simply meant an abandonment of basic communist principles, such as the call for a [[proletarian revolution]], which eventually led many Eurocommunists to abandon communism or even socialism altogether (by giving up their commitment to overthrow capitalism).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Such critics felt strongly vindicated when several Eurocommunist parties scrapped their communist credentials following the fall of the Soviet Union.

''European Triarchy'' was originally published anonymously with the intent of giving a revolutionary impetus to Hegel's Philosophy of History.

'''Food coloring''', or '''color additive''', is any [[dye]], [[pigment]] or substance that imparts [[color]] when it is added to [[food]] or [[drink]]. They come in many forms consisting of liquids, [[powder (substance)|powders]], [[gel]]s, and [[paste (food)|pastes]]. Food coloring is used both in commercial food production and in domestic cooking. Food colorants are also used in a variety of non-food applications including [[cosmetics]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, home craft projects, and medical devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= CFR Title 21 Part 70: Color Additive Regulations |publisher= FDA |origyear= Mar 22 1977 |url= http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=df0d2cc786cc4d2efd1ebf642c9a79fa;rgn=div5;view=text;node=21%3A1.0.1.1.24;idno=21;cc=ecfr#21:1.0.1.1.24.1.31.1 |accessdate= Feb 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of food coloring==
People associate certain colors with certain [[flavor]]s, and the color of food can influence the perceived flavor in anything from [[confectionery|candy]] to [[wine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeannine Delwiche |title=The impact of perceptual interactions on perceived flavor |journal=Food Quality and Preference |year=2003 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=137–146 |doi=10.1016/S0950-3293(03)00041-7 |url=http://www-fst.ag.ohio-state.edu/Pubs/2004/delwiche-fqap1.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228041745/http://www-fst.ag.ohio-state.edu/Pubs/2004/delwiche-fqap1.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the aim is to simulate a color that is perceived by the consumer as natural, such as adding red coloring to [[candied fruit|glacé cherries]] (which would otherwise be beige), but sometimes it is for effect, like the green [[ketchup]] that [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] launched in 1999. Color additives are used in foods for many reasons including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Food Ingredients &amp; Colors |publisher= [[International Food Information Council]] |date= June 29, 2010 |url= http://www.foodinsight.org/Resources/Detail.aspx?topic=Food_Ingredients_Colors |accessdate= Feb 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrows" /&gt;

* To make food more attractive, appealing, appetizing, and informative
* Offset color loss due to exposure to light, air, temperature extremes, moisture and storage conditions
* Correct natural variations in color
* Enhance colors that occur naturally
* Provide color to colorless and "fun" foods
* Allow consumers to identify products on sight, like candy flavors or medicine dosages

== History of artificial food colorants ==
The addition of colorants to foods is thought to have occurred in Egyptian cities as early as 1500 BC, when candy makers added natural extracts and wine to improve the products' appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author= Meggos, H. |title= Food colours: an international perspective |encyclopedia= The Manufacturing Confectioner |pages= 59–65 |publisher= |year= 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], the economy in the European countries was based on agriculture, and the peasants were accustomed to producing their own food locally or trading within the village communities. Under feudalism, aesthetic aspects were not considered, at least not by the vast majority of the generally very poor population.&lt;ref name="Arlt"&gt;{{cite web |last= Arlt |first= Ulrike |title= The Legislation of Food Colours in Europe |publisher= The Natural Food Colours Association |date= 29 Apr 2011 |url= http://www.natcol.org/node/19 |accessdate= 18 Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation changed with urbanization at the beginning of the [[Modern Age]], when trade emerged—especially the import of precious spices and colors. One of the very first food laws, created in Augsburg, Germany, in 1531, concerned spices or colorants and required [[saffron]] counterfeiters to be [[Death by burning|burned]].&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cook |first= Jim |title= Colorants Compliance |journal= The World of Food Ingredients |issue= Sept 2013 |pages= 41–43 |publisher= CNS Media BV |location= Arnhem, The Netherlands |issn= 1566-6611 }}&lt;!--|accessdate= 18 Feb 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

With the onset of the industrial revolution, people became dependent on foods produced by others.&lt;ref name="Arlt" /&gt; These new urban dwellers demanded food at low cost. Analytical chemistry was still primitive and regulations few. The [[Adulterated food|adulteration of foods]] flourished.&lt;ref name="Arlt" /&gt; Heavy metal and other inorganic element-containing compounds turned out to be cheap and suitable to "restore" the color of watered-down milk and other foodstuffs, some more lurid examples being:&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Downham |first1= Alison |last2= Collins |first2= Paul |title= Colouring our foods in the last and next millennium |journal= International Journal of Food Science and Technology |volume= 35 |pages= 5–22 |publisher= Blackwell Science Ltd |year= 2000 |accessdate= 18 Feb 2014 |url= http://www.blacksci.co.uk/products/journals/freepdf/tmp1.pdf |format= PDF |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2621.2000.00373.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Red lead]] (Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[Cinnabar|vermillion]] (HgS) were routinely used to color cheese and confectionery.
* [[Copper arsenite]] (CuHAsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) was used to recolor used tea leaves for resale. It also caused two deaths when used to color a dessert in 1860.

Sellers at the time offered more than 80 artificial coloring agents, some invented for dyeing textiles, not foods.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; {{quote|...Thus, with potted meat, fish and sauces taken at breakfast he would consume more or less [[Armenian bole]], red lead, or even bisulphuret of mercury.

Historical records show that injuries, even deaths, resulted from tainted colorants. In 1851, about 200 people were poisoned in England, 17 of them fatally, directly as a result of eating adulterated [[throat lozenge|lozenges]].&lt;ref name="Arlt" /&gt; In 1856, [[mauveine]], the first [[Synthetic dye#Synthetic dye|synthetic color]], was developed by [[Sir William Henry Perkin]] and by the turn of the century, unmonitored color additives had spread through Europe and the United States in all sorts of popular foods, including ketchup, mustard, jellies, and wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Walford |first= J. |title= Historical Development of Food Colouration |journal= Developments in Food Colours |volume= 1 |pages= 1–25 |publisher= Applied Science Publishers |location= London |year= 1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Global Perspective on the History, Use, and Identification of Synthetic Food Dyes|author1=Sharma, Vinita|author2=McKone, Harold T.|author3=Markow, Peter G.|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|year=2011|volume=88|pages=24-28|doi=10.1021/ed100545v}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, these were dubbed 'coal-tar' colors because the starting materials were obtained from [[bituminous coal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hancock|first=Mary|title=Potential for Colourants from Plant Sources in England &amp; Wales|url=http://ienica.csl.gov.uk/usefulreports/colourants.pdf|work=UK Central Science Laboratory|accessdate=20 January 2013|year=1997|quote=The use of natural dyes in the UK and the rest of the Western economies has been replaced commercially by synthetic dyes, based mainly on aniline and using petroleum or coal tar as the raw stock.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrows"&gt;{{cite web |last=Barrows |first=Julie N. |last2=Lipman |first2=Arthur L. |last3=Bailey |first3=Catherine J. |title= Color Additives: FDA's Regulatory Process and Historical Perspectives |publisher= FDA (Reprinted from Food Safety Magazine October/November 2003 issue) |date= 17 Dec 2009 |url= http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ColorAdditives/RegulatoryProcessHistoricalPerspectives/default.htm |accessdate= 2 Mar 2012|quote=Although certifiable color additives have been called coal-tar colors because of their traditional origins, today they are synthesized mainly from raw materials obtained from petroleum.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attractiveness of the synthetic dyes is that their color, lipophilicity, and other attributes can be engineered by the design of the specific dyestuff. The color of the dyes can be controlled by selecting the number of azo-groups and various [[substituent]]s. Yellow shades are often achieved by using [[acetoacetanilide]]. Red colors are often azo compounds.&lt;ref name=JK /&gt; The pair [[indigo dye|indigo]] and [[indigo carmine]] exhibit the same blue color, but the former is soluble in lipids, and the latter is water-soluble because it has been fitted with [[sulfonate]] [[functional group]]s.

==Regulation==
===History of regulation===
Concerns over food safety led to numerous regulations throughout the world. German food regulations released in 1882 stipulated the exclusion of dangerous minerals such as arsenic, copper, chromium, lead, mercury and zinc, which were frequently used as ingredients in colorants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hastings |first= Robert W. |editor-last= Hamilton |editor-first= John B. |title= Human Food Laws |journal= Journal of the American Medical Association |volume= 30 |issue= 1-13 |pages= 419–421 |publisher= American Medical Association |location= Chicago |date= January–March 1898 |accessdate= 17 Feb 2014 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ilIKAQAAMAAJ |doi=10.1001/jama.1898.72440600019002e}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to today, these first laws followed the principle of a negative listing (substances not allowed for use); they were already driven by the main principles of today's food regulations all over the world, since all of these regulations follow the same goal: the protection of consumers from toxic substances and from fraud.&lt;ref name="Arlt" /&gt; In the United States, the [[s:Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906|Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906]] reduced the permitted list of synthetic colors from 700 down to seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Meadows |first= Michelle |title= A Century of Ensuring Safe Foods and Cosmetics |journal= FDA Consumer magazine |issue= January–February |publisher= FDA |year= 2006 |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/FOrgsHistory/CFSAN/ucm083863.htm |accessdate= 21 Feb 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The seven dyes initially approved were [[Ponceau 3R]] (FD&amp;C Red No. 1), [[Amaranth (dye)|amaranth]] (FD&amp;C Red No. 2), [[erythrosine]] (FD&amp;C Red No. 3), [[indigotine]] (FD&amp;C Blue No. 2), [[Light Green SF]] (FD&amp;C Green No. 2), [[Naphthol yellow 1]] (FD&amp;C Yellow No. 1), and [[Orange 1]] (FD&amp;C Orange No. 1). Even with updated food laws, adulteration continued for many years and this, together with more recent adverse press comments on food colors and health, has continued to contribute to consumer concern about color addition to foodstuffs.

In the 20th century, the improvement of chemical analysis and the development of trials to identify the toxic features of substances added to foods led to the replacement of the negative lists by lists of substances allowed to be used for the production and the improvement of foods. This principle is called a positive listing, and almost all recent legislations are based on it.&lt;ref name="Arlt" /&gt; Positive listing implies that substances meant for human consumption have been tested for their safety, and that they have to meet specified purity criteria prior to their approval by the corresponding authorities. In 1962, the first [[Directive (European Union)|EU directive]] ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=DD:I:1959-1962:31962L2645:EN:PDF 62/2645/EEC]) approved 36 colorants, of which 20 were naturally derived and 16 were synthetic.&lt;ref&gt;EEC: Council Directive on the approximation of the rules of the Member States concerning the colouring matters authorized for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption OJ 115, 11.11.1962, p. 2645–2654 (DE, FR, IT, NL) English special edition: Series I Volume 1959-1962 p. 279–290&lt;/ref&gt; This directive did not list which food products the colorants could or could not be used in. At that time, each [[Member state of the European Union|member state]] could designate where certain colors could and could not be used. In Germany, for example, [[Quinoline Yellow WS|quinoline yellow]] was allowed in puddings and desserts, but [[tartrazine]] was not. The reverse was true in France.&lt;ref name="cook" /&gt; This was updated in 1989 with [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1989:040:0027:0033:EN:PDF 89/107/EEC], which concerned food additives authorized for use in foodstuffs.&lt;ref&gt;Council Directive 89/107/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorized for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption OJ L 40, 11.2.1989, p. 27–33 (ES, DA, DE, EL, EN, FR, IT, NL, PT)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current regulation===
While naturally derived colors are not required to be certified by a number of regulatory bodies throughout the world (including the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]]), they still need to be approved for use in that country. Food colorings are tested for safety by various bodies around the world and sometimes different bodies have different views on food color safety.

FDA's permitted colors are classified as subject to certification or exempt from certification in [http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_01/21cfr73_01.html Code of Federal Regulations - Title 21 Part 73 &amp; 74], both of which are subject to rigorous safety standards prior to their approval and listing for use in foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1= Barrows |first1= Julie N. |last2= Lipman |first2= Arthur L. |last3= Bailey |first3= Catherine J. |editor1-last= Cianci |editor1-first= Sebastian |title= Color Additives: FDA's Regulatory Process and Historical Perspectives |url= http://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/magazine-archive1/octobernovember-2003/color-additives-fdas-regulatory-process-and-historical-perspectives/ |magazine= Food Safety Magazine |publisher= Food Safety Magazine |issue= October/November 2003 |access-date= 24 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Food coloring#U.S.|Certified colors]]''' are synthetically produced and are used widely because they impart an intense, uniform color, are less expensive, and blend more easily to create a variety of hues. There are nine certified color additives approved for use in the United States. Certified food colors generally do not add undesirable flavors to foods.
*Colors that are '''[[Food coloring#Natural food dyes|exempt from certification]]''' include pigments derived from natural sources such as vegetables, minerals, or animals. Nature derived color additives are typically more expensive than certified colors and may add unintended flavors to foods. Examples of exempt colors include [[annatto]], beet extract, [[caramel color|caramel]], beta-carotene, turmeric and grape skin extract. This list contains substances which may have synthetic origins, such as nature identical [[beta-carotene]].

In the United States, [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|FD&amp;C]] numbers (which indicate that the FDA has approved the colorant for use in foods, [[drug]]s and [[cosmetics]]) are given to approved synthetic food dyes that do not exist in nature, while in the European Union, [[E&amp;nbsp;number]]s are used for all additives, both synthetic and natural, that are approved in food applications. The food colors are known by E numbers that begin with a 1, such as E100 ([[turmeric]]) or E161b ([[lutein]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers |publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]] |date=26 Nov 2010 |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist#h_2 |accessdate=20 Feb 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The safety of food colors and other food additives in the EU is evaluated by the [[European Food Safety Authority]]. [http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sfp/addit_flavor/flav08_en.pdf Color Directive 94/36/EC], enacted by the European Commission in 1994, outlines permitted natural and artificial colors with their approved applications and limits in different foodstuffs.&lt;ref name="cook" /&gt; This is binding to all member countries of the EU. Any changes have to be implemented into their national laws within a given time frame. In non-EU member states, food additives are regulated by their national authorities, which usually, but not in all cases, try to harmonize with the laws adopted by the EU. Most other countries have their own regulations and list of food colors which can be used in various applications, including maximum daily intake limits.

*'''FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5''' – [[Tartrazine]], E102 (yellow shade)
*'''FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6''' – [[Sunset Yellow FCF]], E110 (orange shade)

Two dyes are allowed by the FDA for limited applications:
&lt;!-- Not a typo. Orange B is red-colored and Citrus Red 2 is orange-colored. --&gt;
* [[Citrus Red 2]] (orange shade) - allowed only to color orange peels.
* [[Orange B]] (red shade) - allowed only for use in [[hot dog]] and [[sausage]] casings (not produced after 1978, but never delisted)

Many dyes have been delisted for a variety of reasons, ranging from poor coloring properties to regulatory restrictions.&lt;ref name=fdc&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=News of Food; U.S. May Outlaw Dyes Used to Tint Oranges and Other Foods |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1954/01/19/archives/news-of-food-u-s-may-outlaw-dyes-used-to-tint-oranges-and-other.html |quote=The use of artificial colors to make foods more attractive to the eye may be sharply curtailed by action of the United States Food and Drug Administration.

===Global harmonization===
Since the beginning of the 1960s, [[JECFA]] has promoted the development of international standards for food additives, not only by its toxicological assessments, which are continuously published by the [[WHO]] in a [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_960_eng.pdf "Technical Report Series"], but furthermore by elaborating appropriate purity criteria, which are laid down in the two volumes of the [http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/i2358e/i2358e00.pdf "Compendium of Food Additive Specifications"] and their supplements. These specifications are not legally binding but very often serve as a guiding principle, especially in countries where no scientific expert committees have been established.&lt;ref name="Arlt" /&gt;

In order to further regulate the use of these evaluated additives, in 1962 the WHO and FAO created an international commission, the [[Codex Alimentarius]], which is composed of authorities, food industry associations and consumer groups from all over the world. Within the Codex organization, the Codex Committee for Food Additives and Contaminants is responsible for working out recommendations for the application of food additives, the [http://www.codexalimentarius.net/gsfaonline/docs/CXS_192e.pdf General Standard for Food Additives]. In the light of the World Trade Organizations General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ([[GATT]]), the Codex Standard, although not legally binding, influences food color regulations all over the world.&lt;ref name="Arlt" /&gt;

==Natural food dyes==
[[File:Rainbow of food natural food colors.jpg|thumb|Natural food colors can make a variety of different hues]]
[[Carotenoid]]s (E160, E161, E164), [[chlorophyllin]] (E140, E141), [[anthocyanin]]s (E163), and [[betanin]] (E162) comprise four main categories of plant pigments grown to color food products.&lt;ref&gt;Delia B Rodriguez-Amaya "Natural food pigments and colorants" Current Opinion in Food Science 2016, Volume 7, Pages 20–26. {{doi|10.1016/j.cofs.2015.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other colorants or specialized derivatives of these core groups include:
* [[Annatto]] (E160b), a reddish-orange dye made from the seed of the [[achiote]]
* [[Caramel coloring]] (E150a-d), made from caramelized sugar
* [[Carmine]] (E120), a red dye derived from the [[cochineal]] insect, ''[[Dactylopius coccus]]''
* [[Elderberry]] juice (E163)
* [[Lycopene]] (E160d)
* [[Paprika oleoresin|Paprika]] (E160c)
* [[Turmeric]] (E100)
Blue colors are especially rare.&lt;ref&gt;Newsome, A. G.,; Culver, C. A.;van Breemen, R. B. "Nature’s palette: the search for natural blue colorants" J Agric Food Chem 2014, volume 62, pp. 6498-6511. {{DOI|10.1021/jf501419q}}&lt;/ref&gt; One feasible blue dye currently in use is derived from [[spirulina (genus)|spirulina]].

To ensure reproducibility, the colored components of these substances are often provided in highly purified form. For stability and convenience, they can be formulated in suitable carrier materials (solid and liquids). [[Hexane]], [[acetone]], and other [[solvents]] break down cell walls in the fruit and vegetables and allow for maximum extraction of the coloring. Traces of these may still remain in the finished colorant, but they do not need to be declared on the product label. These solvents are known as carry-over ingredients.

== Criticism and health implications ==
Widespread public belief that artificial food coloring causes [[ADHD]]-like hyperactivity in children originated from [[Benjamin Feingold]], a pediatric allergist from California, who proposed in 1973 that salicylates, artificial colors, and artificial flavors cause hyperactivity in children;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Feingold, B.F. |title=Introduction to clinical allergy |publisher=Charles C. Thomas |year=1973 |isbn=0-398-02797-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, there is no evidence to support broad claims that food coloring causes [[food intolerance]] and [[ADHD]]-like behavior in children.&lt;ref&gt;Tomaska LD and Brooke-Taylor, S. ''Food Additives - General'' pp 449-454 in Encyclopedia of Food Safety, Vol 2: Hazards and Diseases. Eds, Motarjemi Y et al.

These colorants are found in beverages.&lt;ref name=FDAdyecomm/&gt;&lt;ref name=FSAguideline&gt;Sarah Chapman of Chapman Technologies on behalf of Food Standards Agency in Scotland.

The European regulatory community, with an emphasis on the [[precautionary principle]], required labelling and temporarily reduced the [[acceptable daily intake]] (ADI) for the food colorings; the UK FSA called for voluntary withdrawal of the colorings by food manufacturers.&lt;ref name=FDAdyecomm/&gt;&lt;ref name=FSAguideline/&gt; However, in 2009 the EFSA re-evaluated the data at hand and determined that "the available scientific evidence does not substantiate a link between the color additives and behavioral effects" for any of the dyes.&lt;ref name=FDAdyecomm/&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSA2009&gt;EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to food (ANS) [http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1330 Scientific Opinion on the re-evaluation of Sunset Yellow FCF (E 110) as a food additive].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12249">'''Forensic speechreading''' (or '''forensic lipreading''') is the use of [[speechreading]] for information or evidential purposes. Forensic speechreading can be considered a branch of [[forensic linguistics]]. In contrast to [[speaker recognition]] which is often the focus of voice analysis from an audio record, forensic speechreading usually aims to establish the ''content'' of speech, since the ''identity'' of the talker is usually apparent. Often, it involves the production of a transcript of lipread [[video]]-records of talk that lack a usable [[Sound|audiotrack]], for example [[CCTV]] material. Occasionally, 'live' lipreading is involved, for example in the Casey Anthony case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/casey-anthony-contradict-defense-mouthing-words/story?id=13999804#.UHK-ZlGgH3U |title=Did Casey Anthony Contradict Her Own Defense by Mouthing Words |publisher=ABC News |date=July 5, 2011 |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forensic speechreaders are usually [[deaf]] or from [[child of deaf adult|deaf families (CODA)]], and use speechreading in their daily lives to a greater extent than people with normal hearing outwith a deaf community. Some speechreading tests suggest deaf people can be better lipreaders than most hearing people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2007/080) |title=Enhanced Visual Speech Perception in Individuals with Early-Onset Hearing Impairment |year=2007 |last1=Auer |first1=Edward T. |last2=Bernstein |first2=Lynne E. |journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research |volume=50 |issue=5 |pmid=17905902 |pages=1157–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speechreading expertise ==

No tests of speechreading have yet been developed in a forensic context: that is, to benchmark individual skills in speechreading from a video record, including production of a reliable transcript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Ruth |last1=Campbell |first2=Tara-Jane Ellis |last2=Mohammed |year=2010 |title=Speechreading for information gathering: a survey of scientific sources |publisher=Deafness Cognition and Language Research Centre |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1347961/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, UK agencies made extensive use of one particular speechreader, whose reports are now not to be used for evidential purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/4626573.stm |title=CPS drops So Solid expert witness |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-06-27 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several speechreaders and deaf professionals currently offer these services.

== The law ==

In the UK, a landmark case and appeal (''R. v Luttrell'' et al., 2004) established the admissibility of lipreading evidence.&lt;ref&gt;original case notes; http://lexisweb.co.uk/cases/2004/may/r-v-luttrell-and-others-r-v-dawson-and-another: appeal court decision; http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2004/1344.html&amp;query=luttrell&amp;method=boolean&lt;/ref&gt; However, the appeal court also required that the judge should issue a special warning as to its risks and limitations.&lt;ref&gt;updated ruling in relation to expert witness evidence;  Mary Luckham 'Forensic lipreading',http://www.qebholliswhiteman.co.uk/articles-pdfs/forensic-lip-reading.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

While lipread speech can carry useful speech information, it is inherently less accurate than (clearly) heard speech because many [[distinctive features]] of speech are produced by actions of the tongue within the oral cavity and are not visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3950202 |year=1986 |last1=Breeuwer |first1=M |last2=Plomp |first2=R |title=Speechreading supplemented with auditorily presented speech parameters |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=481–99 |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |doi=10.1121/1.393536}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Auer2010&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20211120 |year=2010 |last1=Auer |first1=Edward T. |title=Investigating Speechreading and Deafness |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=163–8 |doi=10.3766/jaaa.21.3.4 |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology|pmc=3715375 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a limitation imposed by [[speech]] itself, not the expertise of the speechreader. It is the main reason why the accuracy of a speechreader working on a purely visual record cannot be considered wholly reliable, however skilled they may be and irrespective of hearing status.&lt;ref name=Auer2010/&gt; The type of evidence and the utility of such evidence varies from case to case.

In the US, there is debate concerning the admissibility of speechreading evidence and its status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jspubs.com/experts/ewire/itemtext.cfm?ewid=83 |title=e-wire article: Taking experts out of the court |publisher=Jspubs.com |date=2004-07-15 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in relation to variations in state and federal evidential procedures, and with respect to the privacy implications of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] to the US constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 4, 2011 |author=CM |url=http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/evidenceprof/2011/06/ginsburg-non-t-sandefur-v-state945-ne2d-785indapp2011.html |title=Read My Lips, No Lip Reading Testimony?: Court Of Appeals Of Indiana Opinion Poses Question About Lip Read Statements |publisher=EvidenceProf Blog |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three UK cases involving speechreading evidence ==

* '''R v Luttrell'''.  Nine defendants, including Luttrell, were found guilty on a charge of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and dispose of stolen goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2806155.stm |title=Nine jailed over £11m stolen goods |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-02-27 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his arrest, Luttrell, who pleaded not guilty, was put under surveillance by the police, and a video record was obtained of a conversation. The expert lipreader, acting for the prosecution, produced a transcript of the conversation, indicating that he spoke the name of a co-conspirator. Although the defence claimed this was unreliable evidence, the judge ruled it admissible. On appeal, Luttrell's conviction was upheld, but the court of appeal made clear that juries should be warned of the unreliability of such evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2004/1344.html&amp;query=luttrell&amp;method=boolean |title=Luttrell &amp; Ors, R v [2004&amp;#93; EWCA Crim 1344 (28 May 2004) |publisher=Bailii.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nat Fraser'''. The expert lipreader's transcript of a surveilled prison conversation between Nat Fraser and his friend, Glenn Lucas, was used by the prosecution to help secure a conviction for Fraser's murder of his wife, Arlene Fraser ([[Murder of Arlene Fraser]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1420816/Lip-reader-saw-Frasers-incriminating-conversations.html|title=Lip reader saw Fraser's incriminating conversations|date=2 February 2003|publisher=|accessdate=27 January 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; That verdict was overturned in part on the basis of unreliability of that lipreader's evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/10_october/19/fraser.shtml |title=Press Office - Frontline Scotland reveals new evidence in Arlene Fraser murder case |publisher=BBC |date=2005-10-19 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following successful appeal against his original conviction, on re-trial in 2012 Fraser was again convicted of his wife's murder (''[[Fraser v HM Advocate]]'').
* '''[[R v John Terry]]'''. [[John Terry]] was alleged to have made a crude racist remark against [[Anton Ferdinand]] in the course of a televised [[Premier League]] [[association football|football]] match between [[Chelsea FC]] and [[Queen's Park Rangers FC]].

In a joint report, two expert speecheaders corroborated the content of Terry's broadcast remarks, but could not infer why they were said, since there was no video record of the preceding context.

'''Glyceryl behenate''' is a [[fat]] used in [[cosmetics]], [[food]]s, and oral [[pharmaceutical formulation]]s. In cosmetics, it is mainly used as a [[viscosity]]-increasing agent in [[emulsion]]s.

In pharmaceutical formulations, glyceryl behenate is mainly used as a [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] and [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]] [[lubricant]] and as a lipidic coating [[excipient]]. It has been investigated for the encapsulation of various drugs such as [[retinoid]]s. It has also been investigated for use in the preparation of [[sustained release]] tablets as a matrix-forming agent for the [[controlled release]] of [[water-soluble]] drugs and as a lubricant in oral solid dosage formulations. It can also be used as a hot-melt coating agent sprayed onto a [[powder (substance)|powder]].&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of pharmaceutical excipient, 5th edition&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used widely in cosmetics as non-comedogenic (non- pimple causing substance) ingredient. It does not clog the oil pores of facial skin.

It is also used widely as ingredient for preparation of lipidic nano-particles such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC). Chemically, glyceryl behenate is a mixture of various [[ester]]s of [[behenic acid]] and [[glycerol]] ([[glyceride]]s).&lt;ref name=cfr&gt;{{CodeFedReg|21|184|1328}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mixture predominantly contains the diester glyceryl dibehenate.&lt;ref name=cfr/&gt;

{{Gun laws by country}}
'''Gun laws in Australia''' are mainly the jurisdiction of [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states and territories]], with the importation of guns regulated by the [[Government of Australia|federal government]]. In the last two decades of the 20th century, following several high-profile killing sprees, the federal government coordinated more restrictive firearms legislation with all state governments. Gun laws were largely aligned in 1996 by the [[National Firearms Agreement]].

A person must have a [[firearms license|firearm licence]] to possess or use a firearm. Licence holders must demonstrate a "genuine reason" (which does not include self-defence) for holding a firearm licence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1996/46/part2/div2/sec12|title=Firearms Act 1996 No 46, Part 2, Division 2, Section 12 -  Genuine reasons for having a licence|last=|first=|date=|website=NSW legislation|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and must not be a "prohibited person". All firearms must be registered by serial number to the owner, who also holds a firearms licence. 

Studies on the effects of Australia's gun laws have shown that the laws have not been effective in reducing mass shootings, although they have been somewhat effective in reducing firearm suicides.&lt;ref name=meta/&gt;&lt;ref name="LemieuxBricknell2015"/&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Wang-Sheng |author2=Suardi, Sandy |title=The Australian Firearms Buyback and Its Effect on Gun Deaths|journal=Contemporary Economic Policy |pages=65–79|year=2010|volume=28|issue=1 |doi=10.1111/j.1465-7287.2009.00165.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McPhedran |first=Samara |last2= Baker |first2= Jeanine |title= Mass shootings in Australia and New Zealand: A descriptive study of incidence |journal=Justice Policy Journal |year=2011 |ssrn= 2122854 |volume=8 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polling shows strong support for gun legislation in Australia with around 85 to 90% of people wanting the same or greater level of restrictions.&lt;ref name=poll1/&gt;&lt;ref name=poll2/&gt;&lt;ref name=poll3/&gt;&lt;ref name=poll4/&gt;

== Overview==
The first gun law in Australia was an order in 1807 of [[Governor of New South Wales|New South Wales Governor]] [[William Bligh]] that:

:"all Persons who have arms [are]... to be registered in a Book kept by the Magistrate".

Over the next 100 years, some regulations to punish poachers and to privilege the [[gentry]] were added, following British patterns. During [[World War I]], social changes in Europe and soldiers returning with war-weapons changed the focus from the perceived problem of guns to that of crime, social control and the government's [[monopoly on violence]].

All Australian states and territories enacted gun control regulations between 1921 and 1931. The ''Firearms and Guns Act 1931'' (Western Australia) permitted possession of rifles and shotguns in [[Western Australia]], while other jurisdictions allowed possession of registered handguns only. Until 1981, five out of the eight jurisdictions did not require registration of [[long gun]]s. [[Tasmania]] and [[Queensland]] had no licensing or registration requirements; Victoria, New South Wales and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] had licenses for uncounted long arms without single registration. Between 1984 and 1987, in Victoria, 60% of long guns were registered.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==National legislative structure==
Following the shooting incidents at Port Arthur in 1996 and Monash University in 2002 the Australian state and territory governments, through the then Australian Police Ministers' Council (APMC) and Council of Australian Governments (COAG), entered into three national agreements that were responsible for shaping contemporary Australian firearm laws. These agreements were the:
* [[National Firearms Agreement]] (1996);
* National Firearm Trafficking Policy Agreement (2002); and
* National Handgun Control Agreement (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislative reforms|url=http://aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/rpp/100-120/rpp116/06_reforms.html|website=Australian Institute of Criminology|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=21 December 2017}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/legalcode Attribution 3.0 Australia Australia] license.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ownership, possession and use of firearms in Australia is regulated by state laws.

At the federal level, the importation of firearms is subject to the restrictions in Regulation 4F and Schedule 6 of the ''Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956'' (Cth).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|reg|cir1956432|Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Firearms categories ==
The National Firearm Agreement defines categories of firearms, with different levels of control for each, as follows:.

;Category A: [[Rimfire ammunition|Rimfire]] [[rifle]]s (not [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]]), [[shotguns]] (not [[pump-action]] or semi-automatic), [[air rifles]] including semi-automatic, and [[paintball guns]].
;Category B: [[Centrefire]] rifles including bolt action, pump action and lever action (not semi-automatic) and [[Muzzleloader|muzzleloading]] firearms made after 1 January 1901.
;Category C: Pump-action or self-loading shotguns having a magazine capacity of 5 or fewer rounds and semi-automatic rimfire rifles up to 10 rounds. Primary producers, farm workers, firearm dealers, firearm safety officers, collectors and clay target shooters can own functional Category C firearms.
;Category D: All self-loading centrefire rifles, pump-action or self-loading shotguns that have a magazine capacity of more than 5 rounds, semi-automatic rimfire rifles over 10 rounds, are restricted to government agencies, occupational shooters and primary producers.
;Category H: [[Handgun]]s including [[air pistol]]s and deactivated handguns. This class is available to target shooters and certain security guards whose job requires possession of a firearm. To be eligible for a Category H firearm, a target shooter must serve a probationary period of 6 months using club handguns, after which they may apply for a permit. A minimum number of matches yearly to retain each category of handgun and be a paid-up member of an approved pistol club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/services/firearms |title=Firearms Registry |website=NSW Police Force}}&lt;/ref&gt; Target shooters are limited to handguns of .38 or 9mm calibre or less and magazines may hold a maximum of 10 rounds. Participants in certain "approved" pistol competitions may acquire handguns up to .45 calibre, currently [[Single Action Shooting]] and [[Metallic Silhouette]]. IPSC shooting is approved for 9mm/.38/.357 SIG, handguns that meet the IPSC rules, larger calibres such as .45 were approved for IPSC handgun shooting contests in Australia in 2014, however only in Victoria so far.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipsc.org.au/&lt;/ref&gt; Barrels must be at least 100mm (3.94") long for revolvers, and 120mm (4.72") for semi-automatic pistols unless the pistols are clearly ISSF target pistols; magazines are restricted to 10 rounds.
;Category R/E: Restricted weapons include [[military weapons]] such as [[machine gun]]s, [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launchers]], [[full automatic self loading rifle]]s, [[flame-thrower]]s and [[anti-tank gun]]s.

Certain [[Antique firearms#Australia|antique firearms]] (generally muzzle loading black powder [[flintlock]] firearms manufactured before 1 January 1901) can in some states be legally held without a licence.&lt;ref&gt;In ACT: {{cite Legislation AU|ACT|act|fa1996102|Firearms Act 1996|6}}(2)(a); In NSW: {{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|fa1996102|Firearms Act 1996|6A}}(1); In Qld: {{cite Legislation AU|Qld|act|wa1990107/sch2.html|Weapons Act 1990}} Schedule 2; In SA: for definition of 'antique firearm', see {{cite Legislation AU|SA|act|fa2015102|Firearms Act 2015|5}}, for exemption, see: {{cite Legislation AU|SA|reg|fr2017211|Firearms Regulations 2017|44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In other states they are subject to the same requirements as modern firearms.&lt;ref&gt;In Vic: definition of an 'antique firearm', see {{cite Legislation AU|Vic|act|fa1996102|Firearms Act 1996}} section 3, for licensing, see sections 22–23; In Tas: {{cite Legislation AU|Tas|act|fa1996102|Firearms Act 1996|28}}(1); In WA:{{cite Legislation AU|WA|act|fa1973102|Firearms Act 1973|16}}(1)(b).&lt;/ref&gt; All single-shot muzzleloading firearms manufactured before 1 January 1901 are considered antique firearms. Four states require licences for antique percussion revolvers and cartridge repeating firearms, but in Queensland and Victoria a person may possess such a firearm without a licence, so long as the firearm is registered (percussion revolvers require a licence in Victoria).

==Licensing==
The states issue firearms licences for a legal reason, such as hunting, sport shooting, pest control, collecting and for farmers and farm workers. Licences are prohibited for convicted offenders and those with a history of mental illness. Licences must be renewed every 3 or 5 years (or 10 years in the Northern Territory and South Australia). Full licence-holders must be 18 years of age; minor's permits allow the use of a firearm under adult supervision by those as young as 12 in most states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?Document_ID=49495 Victoria Police - Firearms - Eligibility Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt;

Handguns may be obtained by target shooters, primary producers in some states and certain security guards after serving a probationary six-month period with a shooting club. Restricted weapons include military weapons, high-capacity semi-automatic rifles and pump-action and semi-automatic shotguns holding more than 5 rounds.

==Compliance with National Firearms Agreement==
A 2017 study commissioned by [[Gun Control Australia]] claimed that Australian states had significantly weakened gun laws since the National Firearms Agreement was first introduced, with no jurisdiction fully compliant with the Agreement.&lt;ref name="smh-weakened"&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Malley|first1=Nick|title=Australia's tough gun laws have been weakened by the states, new report|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/australias-tough-gun-laws-have-been-weakened-by-the-states-new-report-20171004-gyuc42.html|accessdate=13 October 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-failed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wahlquist|first1=Calla|title=Australian gun control audit finds states failed to fully comply with 1996 agreement|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/05/gun-control-audit-finds-states-failed-to-fully-comply-with-1996-agreement|accessdate=13 October 2017|work=The Guardian|date=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many states now allow children to fire guns under strict supervision and the mandatory 28 day cooling-off period required for gun purchases has been relaxed, with no waiting period for purchasers who already own at least one gun.&lt;ref name="smh-weakened" /&gt; New South Wales also allows the limited use of moderators via a permit even though they are supposed to be a prohibited weapon.&lt;ref name="guardian-failed" /&gt; No state or territory has outlined a timeframe for achieving full compliance with the National Firearms Agreement.&lt;ref name="abc-nfa2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gothe-Snape|first1=Jackson|title=Should kids have 'permits', 'licences' or no guns at all?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-12/kids-gun-permits-national-firearms-agreement/9033742|accessdate=13 October 2017|work=ABC News|date=12 October 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== European settlement to 19th century ===
[[File:Mounted police and blacks.jpg|thumb|Firearms were used by European settlers during the [[Australian frontier wars]]]]
Firearms were introduced to Australia with European settlement on 26 January 1788, though other seafarers that visited Australia before settlement also carried firearms. The colony of New South Wales was initially a penal settlement, with the military garrison being armed. Firearms were also used for hunting, protection of persons and crops, in crime and fighting crime, and in many military engagements. From the landing of the [[First Fleet]] there was conflict with Aborigines over game, access to fenced land, and spearing of livestock. Firearms were used to protect explorers and settlers from Aboriginal attack. A number of punitive raids and [[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians|massacres of Aboriginals]] were carried out in a series of local conflicts.

From the beginning, there were controls on firearms.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The firearms issued to convicts (for meat hunting) and settlers (for hunting and protection) were stolen and misused, resulting in more controls.  In January 1796, David Collins wrote that "several attempts had been made to ascertain the number of arms in the possession of individuals, as many were feared to be in the hands of those who committed depredations; the crown recalled between two and three hundred stands of arms, but not 50 stands were accounted for".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Halls 1974, Guns in Australia, Paul Hamlyn Pty Ltd Dee Why NSW&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian [[colonists]] also used firearms in conflict with [[bushranger]]s and armed [[rebellion]]s such as the 1804 [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] and the 1854 [[Eureka Stockade]].

===20th century===
Gun laws were the responsibility of each colony and, since [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901, of each state. The Commonwealth does not have constitutional authority over firearms, but it has jurisdiction over customs and defence matters. Federally the external affairs powers can be used to enforce internal control over matters agreed in external treaties.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In New South Wales, handguns were effectively banned after [[World War II]] but the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Olympic Games]] sparked a new interest in the sport of pistol shooting and laws were changed to allow the sport to develop.

In some jurisdictions, individuals may also be subject to [[firearm prohibition order]]s (FPOs), which give police additional powers to search and question the individual for firearms or ammunition without a [[warrant (law)|warrant]]. FPOs have been available in [[New South Wales]] since 1973,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/CICrimJust/2017/5.html McElhone, Megan --- "Now They're Extraordinary Powers': Firearms Prohibition Orders and Warrantless Search Powers in New South Wales" &amp;#91;2017&amp;#93; CICrimJust 5; (2017) 28(3) Current Issues in Criminal Justice 329]&lt;/ref&gt; and are also used in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/terror-suspects-slapped-with-strict-gun-ban-20180605-p4zjmr.html Terror suspects slapped with strict gun ban]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2016, it was estimated that there were 260,000 unregistered guns in Australia, 250,000 long arms and 10,000 handguns, most of them in the hands of organised crime groups and other criminals.&lt;ref name=ACIC/&gt; There are 3 million registered firearms in Australia.&lt;ref name=ACIC&gt;Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, [https://www.acic.gov.au/sites/g/files/net3726/f/2016/10/illicit_firearms_in_australia_0.pdf?v=1477016769 Illicit firearms in Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2017, there were 915,000 registered firearms in New South Wales, 18,967 in the ACT, 298,851 in South Australia, and 126,910 in Tasmania. The other jurisdictions did not make the information public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-11/gun-data-shows-extent-of-private-arsenals-in-suburban-australia/9038350 Police gun data shows extent of private arsenals in suburban Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, there were more private firearms in Australia than there were before the Port Arthur massacre, when 1 million firearms were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theconversation.com/australias-gun-numbers-climb-men-who-own-several-buy-more-than-ever-before-58142 Australia’s gun numbers climb: men who own several buy more than ever before]&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been an incremental move since the 1970s for police forces in the eight jurisdictions in Australia to routinely carry exposed firearms while on duty. In the 1970s the norm was for police to carry a baton, with only NSW police carrying firearms. Since then, police have been authorised to carry a covered firearm, and then to carry an exposed firearm. The shift has taken place without public debate or a proper assessment of the vulnerability of police officers, but has taken place with public acquiescence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crg.aic.gov.au/reports/sarre.pdf Firearms carriage by police in Australia - Policies and issues], by Rick Sarre, Associate Professor, University of South Australia, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
===1984–1996 multiple killings===
From 1984 to 1996, multiple killings aroused public concern.  The 1984 [[Milperra massacre]] was a major incident in a series of conflicts between various "[[outlaw motorcycle gang]]s". In 1987, the [[Hoddle Street massacre]] and the [[Queen Street massacre]] took place in [[Melbourne]].  In response, several states required the registration of all guns, and restricted the availability of [[Semi-automatic rifle|self-loading rifle]]s and shotguns.  In the [[Strathfield massacre]] in New South Wales, 1991, two were killed with a knife, and five more with a firearm.  Tasmania passed a law in 1991 for firearm purchasers to obtain a licence, though enforcement was light.  Firearm laws in [[Tasmania]] and [[Queensland]] remained relatively relaxed for longarms.

====Port Arthur massacre====
{{Main|Port Arthur massacre (Australia)}}
The Port Arthur massacre took place in 1996 when the gunman opened fire on shop owners and tourists with two semi-automatic rifles that left 35 people dead and 23 wounded. This mass killing horrified the Australian public and transformed gun control legislation in Australia.

Prime Minister [[John Howard]] convinced the states to adopt the gun law proposals made in a report of the 1988 National Committee on Violence as the National Firearms Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Howard Government]] held a series of public meetings to explain the proposed changes. In the first meeting, Howard wore a [[bullet-proof vest|bullet-resistant vest]], which was visible under his jacket. Many shooters were critical of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Guerrera |first=Orietta |date=28 April 2006 |title=Anger lingers among those who lost their firearms |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/anger-lingers-among-those-who-lost-their-firearms/2006/04/27/1145861489398.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nicholson |title='E's carrying on like some kind of Nazi |publisher=The Australian |date=17 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dore|first=Christopher|title=The Smoking Guns Buyback|publisher=The Weekend Australian|date=6–27 May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some firearm owners applied to join the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] in an attempt to influence the government, but the party barred them from membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reardon |first=Dave |publisher=The West Australian |date=10 June 1996 |title=Progun Liberals Recruit for Party}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Atkins |first=Dennis |work=The Brisbane Courier Mail |date=26 June 1996 |title=Libs on Alert for Pro-Gun Infiltration}}&lt;/ref&gt; A court action by 500 shooters seeking admission to membership eventually failed in the [[Supreme Court of South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Border Mail – Albury |date=22 February 1997 |title=Shooter Rejected}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Constitution requires just compensation be given for property taken over, so the federal government introduced the ''Medicare Levy Amendment Act 1996'' to raise the predicted cost of A$500 million through a one-off increase in the [[Medicare levy]].

====Monash University shootings====
{{Main|Monash University shooting}}
In October 2002, a [[Bachelor of Commerce|commerce]] student killed two fellow students at [[Monash University]] in Victoria with pistols he had acquired as a member of a shooting club. The gunman, Huan Yun Xiang, was acquitted of crimes related to the shootings due to [[Insanity defense#Australian law|mental impairment]] but ordered to be detained in [[Thomas Embling Hospital]], a high-security hospital for up to 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Topsfield|first1=Jewel|title=Monash gunman not guilty|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/06/17/1087245037927.html|accessdate=26 December 2015|agency=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=18 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in 1996, the federal government urged [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|state governments]] to review handgun laws, and amended legislation was adopted in all states and territories. Changes included a 10-round [[Magazine (firearm)|magazine]] capacity limit, a calibre limit of not more than .38 inches (9.65&amp;nbsp;mm) (since expanded under certain criteria), a [[gun barrel|barrel]] length limit of not less than 120&amp;nbsp;mm (4.72 inches) for [[semi-automatic pistols]] and 100&amp;nbsp;mm (3.94 inches) for revolvers, and even stricter probation and attendance requirements for sporting target shooters. Whilst handguns for sporting shooters are nominally restricted to .38&amp;nbsp;inches as a maximum calibre, it is possible to obtain an endorsement allowing calibres up to .45&amp;nbsp;inches (11.43&amp;nbsp;mm) to be used for metallic silhouette or Single Action Shooting matches. These new laws were opposed not only by sporting shooters groups but also by gun control supporters, who saw it as paying for shooters to upgrade to new guns. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

One government policy was to compensate shooters for giving up the sport. Approximately 25% of pistol shooters took this offer, and relinquished their licences and their right to own pistols for sport for five years; in Victoria it is estimated 1/3 of people surrendering firearms took this option.&lt;ref name=Hudson&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/31/1075340889254.html| work=The Age | first=Phillip | last=Hudson| title=State's gun owners reap $21m| date=1 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014 Sydney hostage crisis====
{{Main|2014 Sydney hostage crisis}}
On 15–16 December 2014, a lone gunman, [[Man Haron Monis]], held hostage 17 customers and employees of a Lindt chocolate café located at Martin Place in Sydney, Australia. The perpetrator was on bail at the time and had previously been convicted of a range of offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/sydney-siege-tony-abbott-launches-urgent-joint-inquiry/story-fnqxbywy-1227159690152|title=Sydney siege: Tony Abbott launches urgent joint inquiry|work=[[The Australian]]|date=17 December 2014|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the hostages and the perpetrator died.

In August 2015, [[Mike Baird]] and [[Troy Grant]] announced a tightening of laws on bail and illegal firearms, creating a new offence for the possession of a stolen firearm, with a maximum of 14 years imprisonment and establishing an Illegal Firearms Investigation and Reward Scheme. This legislative change also introduced measures to reduce illegal firearms in NSW including a ban on the possession of digital blueprints that enable firearms to be manufactured using 3D printers and milling machines for anyone without an appropriate licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coultan|first1=Mark|title=New firearms restrictions and bail laws for NSW after Martin Place siege|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/new-firearms-restrictions-and-bail-laws-for-nsw-after-martin-place-siege/news-story/109b8ce5bd692d0da5e19521aa5f03e5|accessdate=26 December 2015|work=NSW Deputy Premier Troy Grant said that penalties for firearm offences will be increased, with a new offence of possession of a stolen firearm, which will carry a maximum penalty of 14 years jail.

==Gun amnesties==
In New South Wales there have been three gun amnesties in 2001, 2003 and 2009. 63,000 handguns were handed in during the first two amnesties and over 4,323 handguns were handed in during the third amnesty. During the third amnesty 21,615 firearm registrations were received by the Firearms Registry. The surrendered firearms were all destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gun Amnesty goes Gangbusters|url=https://www.marketingmag.com.au/hubs-c/gunamnestygoesgangbusters/|website=Marketing|publisher=Niche Media|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring the effects of firearms laws in Australia==

===Measures and trends in social problems related to firearms===
Between 1991 and 2001, the number of firearm-related deaths in Australia declined by 47%. Suicides committed with firearms accounted for 77% of these deaths, followed by firearms homicide (15%), firearms accidents (5%), firearms deaths resulting from legal intervention and undetermined deaths (2%). The number of firearms suicides was in decline consistently from 1991 to 1998, two years after the introduction of firearm regulation in 1996.&lt;ref name=MazousRushforth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/261-280/tandi269.html|title=Firearm related deaths in Australia, 1991-2001|publisher=Australian Institute of Criminology|author1=Jenny Mouzos|author2=Catherine Rushforth|date=November 2003|accessdate=6 September 2017}}

Suicide deaths using firearms more than halved in ten years, from 389 deaths in 1995, to 147 deaths in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=3309.0.55.001 – Suicides: Recent Trends, Australia, 1992 to 2002 |author=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=2 December 2003 |url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/952361A2A29BDBB4CA25729D001C09CF/$File/33090_2005.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is equal to 7% of all suicides in 2005. Over the same period, suicides by hanging increased by over 52% from 699 in 1995 to 1068 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=3309 Suicides Australia 2005 |author=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=14 March 2007 |url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/952361A2A29BDBB4CA25729D001C09CF/$File/33090_2005.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of guns stolen fell from an average 4,195 per year from 1994 to 2000 to 1,526 in 2006–2007. Long guns are more often stolen opportunistically in home burglaries, but few homes have handguns and a substantial proportion of stolen handguns are taken from security firms and other businesses; only a small proportion, 0.06% of licensed firearms, are stolen in a given year. A small proportion of those firearms are reported to be recovered. About 3% of these stolen weapons are later connected to an actual crime or found in the possession of a person charged with a serious offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bricknell, S |title=Firearm theft in Australia 2006–07 |publisher=[[Australian Institute of Criminology]] |year=2008|isbn=978-1-921532-05-4|issn=1445-7261 |url=http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/mr/mr02/mr02.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2011 and 2012, pistols and semi-automatic pistols were traded on the black market for ten to twenty thousand dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gun Runners|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/gun-runners-promo/8518600|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=4 Corners|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=15 May 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
In 1997, the Prime Minister appointed the Australian Institute of Criminology to monitor the effects of the gun buyback. The institute has published a number of papers reporting trends and statistics around gun ownership and gun crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Mouzos, Jenny |title=Trends and Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice No. 151: The licensing and registration status of firearms used in homicide|publisher=[[Australian Institute of Criminology]] |year=2000|isbn=0-642-24162-7|issn=0817-8542|url=http://aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/tandi_pdf/tandi151.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Mouzos, Jenny|title=Trends and Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice No. 230: Firearms theft in Australia |publisher=[[Australian Institute of Criminology]] |year=2002|isbn=0-642-24265-8|issn=0817-8542|url=http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/tandi_pdf/tandi230.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have followed, providing varying results stemming from different methodologies and areas of focus.  [[David Hemenway]] and Mary Vriniotis of Harvard University, funded by the [[Joyce Foundation]] summarized the research in 2011 and concluded;  “it would have been difficult to imagine more compelling future evidence of a beneficial effect.” They said that a complication in evaluating the effect of the NFA was that gun deaths were falling in the early 1990s. They added that everyone should be pleased with the "immediate, and continuing, reduction" in firearm suicide and firearm homicide following the NFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Australian Gun Buyback |url=https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1264/2012/10/bulletins_australia_spring_2011.pdf|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502205312/http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/files/2013/01/bulletins_australia_spring_2011.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2013|work='''Bullet'''ins

Suicide reduction from firearm regulation is disputed by Richard Harding in his 1981 book "Firearms and Violence in Australian Life"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Firearms and Violence in Australian Life|last = Harding|first = Richard|publisher = University of Western Australia Press|year = 1981|isbn = 0 85564 190 8|location = Perth|pages = 119}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, after reviewing Australian statistics, he said that "whatever arguments might be made for the limitation or regulation of the private ownership of firearms, suicide patterns do not constitute one of them" Harding quoted a 1969 international analysis by Newton and Zimring&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/769NCJRS.pdf|title = Firearms and Violence in American Life|last = Newton|first = George|date = 1968|journal = Report Submitted to the National Commission on the Causes &amp; Prevention of Violence|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 8 February 2016|last2 = Zimring|first2 = Franklin}}&lt;/ref&gt; of twenty developed countries which concluded at page 36 of their report; "cultural factors appear to affect suicide rates far more than the availability and use of firearms. Thus, suicide rates would not seem to be readily affected by making firearms less available." Harding later supported 1985 laws to restrict gun ownership in New South Wales, saying that laws contributing to "slowing down in the growth of the Australian gun inventory" are "to be welcomed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/15111/1/POIOC_64_1985.pdf|title=Gun law reform in New South Wales:Better late than never |page=32|last=Harding|first=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Jenny Mouzos from the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]] examined the rate of firearm theft in Australian states in territories following the firearm regulation. She found that "the NFA... is having the desired effect: securely stored firearms are proving less vulnerable to theft."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mouzos|first1=Jenny|title=Firearms Theft in Australia|date=June 2002|publisher=Australian Institute of Criminology|isbn=0 642 24265 8|edition=230|url=http://aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/tandi_pdf/tandi230.pdf|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, researchers from the [[Monash University Accident Research Centre]] examined firearm deaths and mortality in the years before and after firearm regulation. They concluded that there was "dramatic" reduction in firearm deaths and especially suicides due to "the implementation of strong regulatory reform".&lt;ref name="Ozanne-Smith2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ozanne-Smith|first1=J|title=Firearm related deaths: the impact of regulatory reform|journal=Injury Prevention|volume=10|issue=5|year=2004|pages=280–286|issn=1353-8047|doi=10.1136/ip.2003.004150|pmc=1730132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple studies have been conducted by Jeanine Baker and Samara McPhedran, researchers with the International Coalition for Women in Shooting and Hunting (WiSH). In 2006 they reported a lack of a measurable effect from the 1996 firearms legislation in the ''British Journal of Criminology''. Using [[Autoregressive integrated moving average|ARIMA]] analysis, they found little evidence for an impact of the laws on homicide, but did for suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baker |first=Jeanine |author2=McPhedran, Samara |title=Gun Laws and Sudden Death: Did the Australian Firearms Legislation of 1996 Make a Difference? |journal=British Journal of Criminology |volume= 47|issue= 3 |pages=455–469 |date=18 October 2006 |url=http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/azl084v1 |doi=10.1093/bjc/azl084 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, they compared the incidence of [[mass shooting]]s in Australia and New Zealand.  Data were standardised to a rate per 100,000 people, to control for differences in population size between the countries and mass shootings before and after 1996/1997 were compared between countries.  That study found that in the period 1980–1996, both countries experienced mass shootings.  The rate did not differ significantly between countries.  Since 1996-1997, neither country has experienced a mass shooting event despite the continued availability of semi-automatic longarms in New Zealand.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Semi-automatic rifles are permitted in New Zealand with the standard "category A" [[Firearms licence (New Zealand)|New Zealand firearm license]] provided the gun is not a [[military-style semi-automatic]] which among other things means it must have a magazine capacity of at most 7 rounds.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors conclude that "if civilian access to certain types of firearms explained the occurrence of mass shootings in Australia then New Zealand would have continued to experience mass shooting events."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  In 2012, McPhedran and Baker found there was little evidence for any impacts of the gun laws on firearm suicide among people under 35 years of age, and suggest that the significant financial expenditure associated with Australia's firearms method restriction measures may not have had any impact on youth suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McPhedran |first=Samara |author2=Baker, Jeanine |title= Suicide Prevention and Method Restriction: Evaluating the Impact of Limiting Access to Lethal Means among Young Australians |journal=Archives of Suicide Research |pages=135–146 |year=2012 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pmid=22551044 |doi=10.1080/13811118.2012.667330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head of the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, [[Don Weatherburn]] described the Baker and McPhedran article as "reputable" and "well-conducted" but also stated that "it would be wrong to infer from the study that it does not matter how many guns there are in the community."

A 2006 study coauthored by Simon Chapman concluded: "Australia's 1996 gun law reforms were followed by more than a decade free of fatal mass shootings, and accelerated declines in firearm deaths, particularly suicides. Total homicide rates followed the same pattern. Removing large numbers of rapid-firing firearms from civilians may be an effective way of reducing mass shootings, firearm homicides and firearm suicides."&lt;ref name=mass&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chapman |first=Simon |author2=P Alpers, P |author3=Agho, K |author4=Jones, M |title=Australia's 1996 gun law reforms: faster falls in firearm deaths, firearm suicides, and a decade without mass shootings |journal=Injury Prevention |volume=12 |pages=365–72 |year=2006 |url=http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/12/6/365 |doi=10.1136/ip.2006.013714 |pmid=17170183 |issue=6 |pmc=2704353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

of firearms... have resulted in a decline in total suicide rates" and recommended further reduction in the availability of lethal means.&lt;ref name=meta&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.mja.com.au/system/files/issues/192_08_190410/lar10771_fm.pdf|title=Suicide in Australia: meta-analysis of rates and methods of suicide between 1988 and 2007|last1=Large|first1=Matthew|last2=Nielssen|first2=Olav}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study on the effects of the firearm buybacks by Wang-Sheng Lee and Sandy Suardi of [[University of Melbourne]] and [[La Trobe University]] studied the data and concluded "the NFA did not have any large effects on reducing firearm homicide or suicide rates."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 2009 a study published in the ''Journal of Sociology'' examined the rate of firearm suicide in Queensland. They found that "gun suicides are continuing to decrease in Queensland" and is "most likely as a function of ongoing gun controls".&lt;ref name="TaitCarpenter2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tait|first1=Gordon|last2=Carpenter|first2=Belinda|title=Firearm suicide in Queensland|journal=Journal of Sociology|volume=46|issue=1|year=2009|pages=83–98|issn=1440-7833|doi=10.1177/1440783309337673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 another paper from the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention at Griffith University also studied suicide in Queensland only. The said "No significant difference was found in the rate pre/post the introduction of the NFA in Queensland; however, a significant difference was found for Australian data, the quality of which is noticeably less satisfactory."&lt;ref name="KlieveBarnes2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klieve|first1=Helen|last2=Barnes|first2=Michael|last3=De Leo|first3=Diego|title=Controlling firearms use in Australia: has the 1996 gun law reform produced the decrease in rates of suicide with this method?|journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology|volume=44|issue=4|year=2008|pages=285–292|issn=0933-7954|doi=10.1007/s00127-008-0435-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by Christine Neill and Andrew Leigh found the 1997 gun buyback scheme reduced firearm suicides by 74% while having no effect on non-firearm suicides or substitution of method.&lt;ref name=LeighNeill&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leigh |first=Andrew |author2=Neill, Christine |title=Do Gun Buybacks Save Lives?

A 2014 report stated that approximately "260,000 guns are on the Australian 'grey' or black markets", and discussed the potential problem of people using 3D printers to create guns.  NSW and Victorian police obtained plans to create 3D printed guns and tested to see if they could fire, but the guns exploded during testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/13/australia-has-250000-illegal-firearms-guns|title=Australia has 260,000 illegal firearms in circulation, inquiry told|first=Bridie|last=Jabour|date=13 October 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 report Samantha Bricknell from the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]], Frederic Lemieux and Tim Prenzler compared mass shootings between America and Australia and found the "1996 NFA coincided within the cessation of mass shooting events" in Australia, and that there were reductions in America that were evident during the 1994-2004 US Federal Assault Weapon Ban.&lt;ref name="LemieuxBricknell2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lemieux|first1=Frederic|last2=Bricknell|first2=Samantha|last3=Prenzler|first3=Tim|title=Mass shootings in Australia and the United States, 1981-2013|journal=Journal of Criminological Research, Policy and Practice|volume=1|issue=3|year=2015|pages=131–142|issn=2056-3841|doi=10.1108/JCRPP-05-2015-0013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 journal article in the ''International Review of Law and Economics'' evaluated the effect of the NFA on overall crime, rather than just firearm deaths like other studies. Using the [[difference in differences]] identification approach, they found that after the NFA, "there were significant decreases in armed robbery and attempted murder relative to sexual assault".&lt;ref name="TaylorLi2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Benjamin|last2=Li|first2=Jing|title=Do fewer guns lead to less crime?

In 2016 four researchers evaluated the National Firearms Agreement after 20 years in relation to mental health. They said that the "NFA exemplifies how firearms regulation can prevent firearm mortality and injuries."&lt;ref name="DudleyRosen2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dudley|first1=Michael J|last2=Rosen|first2=Alan|last3=Alpers|first3=Philip A|last4=Peters|first4=Rebecca|title=The Port Arthur massacre and the National Firearms Agreement: 20 years on, what are the lessons?|journal=The Medical Journal of Australia|volume=204|issue=10|year=2016|pages=381–383|issn=0025-729X|doi=10.5694/mja16.00293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 a study by Adam Lankford, associate professor of criminal justice, examined the links between public mass shootings and gun availability in various countries. He found that the restrictions in Australia were effective, concluding that "in the wake of these policies, Australia has yet to experience another public mass shooting."&lt;ref name="Lankford2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lankford|first1=Adam|title=Public Mass Shooters and Firearms: A Cross-National Study of 171 Countries|journal=Violence and Victims|volume=31|issue=2|year=2016|pages=187–199|issn=0886-6708|doi=10.1891/0886-6708.VV-D-15-00093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 oral presentation published in ''[[Injury Prevention]]'' examined the effect of the NFA on overall firearm mortality. They found that the NFA decreased firearm deaths by 61% and concluded that "Australian firearm regulations indeed contributed to a decline in firearm mortality."&lt;ref name="AndreyevaUkert2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andreyeva|first1=Elena|last2=Ukert|first2=Benjamin|title=11 Do firearm regulations work? evidence from the australian national firearms agreement|year=2017|pages=A4.2–A4|doi=10.1136/injuryprev-2017-042560.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After this study, these researchers were reported in the Journal of Experimental Criminology in connection with another study with Charles Branas at Columbia University which concluded; "Current evidence showing decreases in firearm mortality after the 1996 Australian national firearm law relies on an empirical model that may have limited ability to identify the true effects of the law." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11292-017-9313-3|title=Time series robustness checks to test the effects of the 1996 Australian firearm law on cause-specific mortality|first1=Benjamin|last1=Ukert|first2=Elena|last2=Andreyeva|first3=Charles C.|last3=Branas|date=29 October 2017|publisher=|journal=Journal of Experimental Criminology|pages=1–14|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/s11292-017-9313-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major players in gun politics in Australia==

===Federal government===
Until 1996, the federal government had little role in firearms law. Following the Port Arthur massacre, the [[Howard Government]] (1996–2007), with strong media and public support, introduced uniform gun laws with the cooperation of all the states, brought about through threats to Commonwealth funding arrangements. Then Prime Minister John Howard frequently referred to the United States to explain his opposition to civilian firearms ownership and use in Australia, stating that he did not want Australia to go "down the American path".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guncite.com/LATimesASW/weapon4a.htm Los Angeles Times Special Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325081644/http://www.guncite.com/LATimesASW/weapon4a.htm |date=25 March 2006 }} ''Australia's Answer to Carnage: a Strict Law'', Jeff Brazil and Steve Berry, 27 August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pm.gov.au/news/interviews/1998/3awmitch.htm Radio 3AW] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824132546/http://www.pm.gov.au/news/interviews/1998/3awmitch.htm |date=24 August 2006 }} John Howard radio interview, 20 March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianpolitics.com/news/2002/05/02-05-29.shtml John Howard's address to the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia], Canberra, 28 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In one interview on Sydney radio station [[2GB]] he said, "We will find any means we can to further restrict them because I hate guns... ordinary citizens should not have weapons. We do not want the American disease imported into Australia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP INTERVIEW WITH PHILIP CLARK, RADIO 2GB|url=https://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/release/transcript-12532|accessdate=16 March 2016|work=That is one of the difficulties and we will find any means we can to further restrict them because I hate guns.

We do not want the American disease imported into Australia.|agency=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet|publisher=Australian Government|date=17 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Howard, as opposition leader, had expressed a desire to introduce restrictive gun laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Role of Government: John Howard 1995 Headland Speech|url=http://australianpolitics.com/1995/06/06/john-howard-headland-speech-role-of-govt.html|accessdate=16 March 2016|work=Let me say that in the ebbing and flowing debate on the availability of weapons, I am firmly on the side of those who believe that it would be a cardinal tragedy if Australia did not learn the bitter lessons of the United States regarding guns. I have no doubt that the horrific homicide level in the United States is directly related to the plentiful supply of guns. How else does one explain the simple fact that in the United States the murder rate is 10 per 100,000, against one per 100,000 in England and Wales and 2.0 in Australia. Whilst making proper allowance for legitimate sporting and recreational activities and the proper needs of our rural community, every effort should be made to limit the carrying of guns in Australia.|publisher=AUSTRALIANPOLITICS.COM|date=6 June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Howard's autobiography ''[[Lazarus Rising: A Personal and Political Autobiography]]'', Howard expressed his support for the anti-gun cause and his desire to introduce restrictive gun laws long before he became prime minister. In a television interview shortly before the 10th anniversary of the Port Arthur massacre, he reaffirmed his stance: "I did not want Australia to go down the American path. There are some things about America I admire and there are some things I don't. And one of the things I don't admire about America is their... slavish love of guns. They're evil". During the same television interview, Howard also stated that he saw the outpouring of grief in the aftermath of the Port Arthur massacre as "an opportunity to grab the moment and think about a fundamental change to gun laws in this country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Karl Stefanovic Today Show, Channel Nine|url=https://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/release/transcript-22147|accessdate=16 March 2016|work=Oh I recall that very vividly.

I did not want Australia to go down the American path. There are some things about America I admire, there are some things I don't and one of the things I don't admire about America is an almost drooling, slavish love of guns. I think they're evil.|agency=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet|publisher=Australian Government|date=1 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard had strong public support in the immediate aftermath of the Port Arthur massacre, especially from those people who regularly voted against the Liberal Party. The Nationals had strong support from rural voters, some of whom were opposed to the government's moves towards gun control.

The National Firearms Agreement has had continuing support from both Labor and Coalition federal governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=SSAA National |title=Australian Labor Party statement |journal=Capital News |date=November 2007 |url=http://www.ssaa.org.au/capital-news/2007/2007-11_asj-australian-labor-party-statement.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=SSAA National |title=Australian Labor Party statement |date=August 2010 |url=http://www.ssaa.org.au/capital-news/2010/2010-08-05_australian-labor-party-election-statement.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun control organisations===
The [[National Coalition for Gun Control]] (NCGC) had a high profile in the public debate up to and immediately after the Port Arthur massacre. [[Rebecca Peters]], Roland Browne, Simon Chapman and Reverend [[Tim Costello]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phillip|last=Hudson|title=Handgun curbs on the way|date=25 October 2002|publisher=[[The Age]]|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/24/1035416935873.html | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in media reports and authored articles to support their aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rebecca |last=Peters |title=Nations disarm as laws tighten (opinion) |date=28 April 2006 |publisher=[[The Australian]] |url=http://theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,18950038-7583,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507151917/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,18950038-7583,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 May 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of Port Arthur a number of public health bodies added their support to the NCGC.

In 1996, the NCGC had received the Australian [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]]'s Community Human Rights award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1996 Human Rights Medal and Awards Winners|url=https://hrawards.humanrights.gov.au/1996-human-rights-medal-and-awards-winners|website=Australian Human Rights Commission|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Samantha Lee as chair of the NCGC was financed by a Churchill Fellowship to publish a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lee, Samantha |title=Handguns: Laws, Violence and Crime in Australia |publisher=Churchill Fellowship Research Paper |year=2003|url=http://churchilltrust.com.au/Fellows%20Reports/Lee%20Samantha%202003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that current handgun legislation is too loose, that police officers who are shooters have a [[conflict of interest]], and that licensed private firearm ownership ''per se'' presents a threat to women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liverani, Mary Rose |title= Maintaining a watching brief on gun control – Activist adds law studies to her arsenal|journal=Journal of the Law Society of New South Wales|date=July 2005|url=http://www.lawsociety.com.au/JournalSearch/JournalArticle.aspx?ArticleId=45506}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a late 2005 press release, Roland Browne as co-chair of the NCGC, advocated further restrictions on handguns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phillip |last=Coorey |title=Howard's sights set on reducing gun ownership|date=27 April 2006 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/howard-aims-to-reduce-gun-ownership/2006/04/26/1145861419468.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2006/s1624794.htm Interview with Barney Porter], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] radio, 27 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-gun organisations===
Shooting clubs have existed in Australia since the mid-19th century. They are mainly concerned with protecting the viability of [[hunting]], collecting and target [[shooting sports]]. Australian shooters regard their sport as under permanent threat from increasingly restrictive legislation. They argue that they have been made [[scapegoats]] by politicians, the media, and anti-gun activists for the acts of criminals who generally use illegal firearms. Their researchers have found scant evidence that increasing restrictions have improved [[public safety]], despite the high costs and severe regulatory barriers imposed on shooters in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= SSAA Research Archive |url= http://www.ssaa.org.au/research-archive.html|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Ten years after the National Firearms Agreement of 1996 Australian Shooter |date=June 2006 |url= http://www.ssaa.org.au/research/2006/2006-06_ten-years-after-national-firearms-agreement.html|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest organisation of firearms owners is the [[Sporting Shooters Association of Australia]] (SSAA) which was established in 1948, and as at 2015 had 175,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=SSAA National |title=SSAA National membership figures |journal=About us |date=October 2013 |url=http://www.ssaa.org.au/about-us.html|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSAA state branches lobby on local issues, while SSAA National addresses federal legislation and international issues. SSAA National has non-government organisation (NGO) status at the [[United Nations]] and is a founding member of [http://www.wfsa.net The World Forum on the Future of Sport Shooting Activities] (WFSA), which also has NGO status. SSAA National has a number of people working in research and lobbying roles. In 2008, they appointed journalist and media manager Tim Bannister as federal parliamentary lobbyist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=SSAA National |title=Capital News |date=June 2008 |url=http://www.ssaa.org.au/capital-news.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
SSAA argues that there is no evidence that gun control restrictions in 1987, 1996 and 2002 had any impact on the already established trends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssaa.org.au/research/2005/2005-07-04_trouble-in-paradise-goroka.pdf Trouble in Paradise] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927034746/http://www.ssaa.org.au/research/2005/2005-07-04_trouble-in-paradise-goroka.pdf |date=27 September 2009 }}, SSAA presentation at Goroka Gun Summit, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssaa.org.au/press-releases/2004-11-04_the-impact-gun-control-laws-called-into-question.html The impact of gun-control laws called into question] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923040019/http://www.ssaa.org.au/press-releases/2004-11-04_the-impact-gun-control-laws-called-into-question.html |date=23 September 2009 }}, SSAA media release, November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Also, responding to Neill and Leigh, SSAA said that 93% of people replaced their seized firearms with at least one, to replace their surrendered firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssaa.org.au/press-releases/2010-08-31_prevention-not-gun-buy-backs-key-to-suicide-reduction.html |title=Prevention, not gun buy-backs, key to suicide reduction |publisher=Sporting Shooters Association of Australia|accessdate=2010-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128075207/http://ssaa.org.au/press-releases/2010-08-31_prevention-not-gun-buy-backs-key-to-suicide-reduction.html |archive-date=28 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For handguns, one major organisation in Australia is Pistol Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pistol Australia|url=http://www.pistol.org.au/the-organisation|publisher=Pistol Australia|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several other national bodies, such as (SIFA) [[Shooting Industry Foundation of Australia]], Field and Game Australia, the National Rifle Association of Australia, the International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC), the Australian Clay Target Association and Target Rifle Australia. These national bodies with their state counterparts concentrate on a range of sporting and political issues ranging from Olympic type competition through to conservation activities.

The Combined Firearms Council of Victoria (CFCV) was created in late 2002 and has been very active in the debate in Victoria. The CFCV ran advertisements in the [[Victorian state election, 2002|2002 Victorian state election]] and made voting recommendations at the 2002 and 2006 Victorian state elections, supporting specific candidates rather than political parties. Four of the six Labor MPs elevated to the front bench after the 2002 Victorian election were supported by the CFCV. A Firearms Consultative Committee, established in 2005 in Victoria, led to several changes to firearms legislation that benefited handgun users and gun collectors.

The [[Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party]] is a political party that started in New South Wales claims to be "the voice of hunters, shooters, fishers, rural and regional Australia and independent thinking Australians everywhere. Advocating for the politically incorrect, a voice of reason, science and conservation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shootersandfishers.org.au/about-us Shooters Party website]. Accessed 12 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Its founder, John Tingle, served as an elected member of the upper house of New South Wales parliament, the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]], from 1995 until he retired in late 2006. {{As of|2018|March }} the party holds two seats in the NSW Legislative Council, and one seat in the Legislative Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/members/pages/all-members.aspx?house=both&amp;tab=filter&amp;party=shooters,%20fishers%20and%20farmers%20party |title=Members of NSW Parliament: Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326011233/https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/members/pages/all-members.aspx?house=both&amp;tab=filter&amp;party=shooters,%20fishers%20and%20farmers%20party |archive-date=26 March 2018 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 a Western Australian branch was formed and stood candidates in the state elections, winning a seat in the WA Legislative Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/parliament/memblist.nsf/WCouncilMembers?openform |title=Current Members of the Legislative Council |website=Parliament.WA.gov.au |access-date=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shooters and Fishers candidates won two upper house seats in the [[Results of the Victorian state election, 2014 (Legislative Council)|2014 Victorian state election]].

The [[Shooting Industry Foundation of Australia]] (SIFA) used $550,000 to launch an advertising campaign, named Flick’em, in an effort to urge voters to put both [[Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)|major]] [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|parties]] last in ballot paper preferences in 2017. This campaign boosted votes for [[Pauline Hanson's One Nation]] and the [[Katter's Australian Party]] and achieved lowest major party votes in QLD history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGowan|first1=Michael|title=Australian gun lobby invests in rightwing parties in push to weaken reforms|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/07/australian-gun-lobby-donations-rightwing-minor-parties-weaken-reforms-control|accessdate=7 March 2018|work=[[Guardian Australia]]|date=6 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other parties ===
The [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]] party in 1997–98 briefly gained national prominence and had strong support from shooters. A number of minor political parties such as the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Australia]] (who are currently represented by [[David Leyonhjelm]] in the Australian Senate), [[Outdoor Recreation Party]], [[Australian Country Party (2004)|Country Alliance]] and [[Katter's Australian Party]] (represented by [[Bob Katter]] in the House of Representatives)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Issues: Firearm Policy|url=http://www.ausparty.org.au/issues.html|accessdate=31 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826235136/http://www.ausparty.org.au/issues.html|archivedate=26 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; have pro-shooter/pro-firearm platforms.

===Public opinion===
In 2015, Essential Research performed a poll regarding the support for Australia's gun laws.

==Founding==
{{also|Party Foundation Day}}

According to North Korean sources, the origins of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] can be traced to the [[Down-With-Imperialism Union]], which was supposedly founded on October 17, 1926 and led by [[Kim Il-sung]], then 14 years old. It is described in these sources as "the first genuine revolutionary communist organization in Korea."&lt;ref&gt;Kim Il-sung. ''Works'' Vol. I. Pyongyang: Foreign Languages Publishing House. 1980. p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Workers' Party of North Korea]] was formed on 29 August 1946 from a merger between the [[Communist Party of North Korea]] and the [[New Democratic Party of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;Kim Il-sung. ''Works'' Vol. 2. Pyongyang: Foreign Languages Publishing House. 1980. p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 1949, the Workers Party of North Korea and the [[Workers' Party of South Korea]] merged, forming the Workers' Party of Korea, at a congress in [[Pyongyang]]. Both parties traced their origins to the [[Communist Party of Korea]]. Kim Il-sung of the Workers Party of North Korea became the party Chairman{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and [[Pak Hon-yong]], who had been leader of the Workers Party of South Korea as well as the earlier Communist Party of Korea, and [[Alexei Ivanovich Hegay]]&lt;ref name="HegayNames"&gt;{{lang-ko|'''허가이'''}}, {{lang-ru|'''Алексей Иванович Хегай'''}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hegay"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-01-09|language=Russian|publisher=Khasansky District: History, Nature, Geography (by Kulinczenko Marseille and Larissa)|title='''Hagay Aleksei Ivanovich'''|url=http://khasan-district.narod.ru/directory/person/hegay.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogai"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-01-11|first=Andrei Nikolaevich|last=Lankov|language=Russian|publisher=The Seoul Herald (Editor: Evgeny Shtefan) &gt;&gt; Library|title=HO GA I: Background of Life and Work|url=http://vestnik.tripod.com/library/hogai.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201040146/http://vestnik.tripod.com/library/hogai.html|archivedate=2007-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming deputy chairmen. There were a total of ten members of the first DPRK Politiburo.&lt;ref name="The Real North Korea 2013"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Real North Korea | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Lankov, Andrei | year=2013 | pages=13 to 14 | isbn=978-0-19-996429-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other members were [[Yi Sung-yop]], [[Kim Sam-yong]], [[Kim Ch aek]], [[Kim Tu-Bong]], [[Pal Il-u]], and [[Pak Chong-ae]].&lt;ref name="The Real North Korea 2013"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Real North Korea | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Lankov, Andrei | year=2013 | pages=13 to 14 | isbn=978-0-19-996429-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most were later purged by Kim Il-sung.&lt;ref name="The Real North Korea 2013"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Real North Korea | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Lankov, Andrei | year=2013 | pages=13 to 14 | isbn=978-0-19-996429-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, official North Korean sources consider October 10, 1945 as the 'Party Foundation Day', citing a founding meeting of the 'North Korea Bureau of the Communist Party of Korea' founded under Soviet guidance. Foreign historians, however, dispute that date and claim that the meeting was in fact held on October 13. The party considers itself as a direct continuation of the North Korea Bureau and the Workers Party of North Korea, considering the two congresses of the Workers Party of North Korea as its own. This version of events can be seen as a move to downplay the importance of the communists from [[South Korea]], who were purged in the 1950s.

The first five years of the WPK's rule were dominated by the [[Korean War]]. By October 1950, [[United Nations]] forces had occupied most of the DPRK and the WPK leadership had to flee to [[People's Republic of China|China]]. Many believe that if it had not been for Chinese intervention, the Korean communists would have been militarily defeated at that point. But in November, [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese forces]] entered the war and threw the U.N. forces back, retaking Pyongyang in December and Seoul in January 1951. In March U.N. forces retook Seoul, and the front was stabilised along what eventually became the permanent "Armistice Line" of 1953. The WPK was able to re-establish its rule north of this line.

==Education of new state apparatus==
In preparing to build the party-state according to the tradition in other states of the communist bloc, Kim Il-sung quoted Joseph Stalin's statement that "cadres decide everything", and thrust the cadre policy into the forefont of issues needing attention.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick, "The Cultural Front: Power and Culture in Revolutionary Russia"&lt;/ref&gt; The first problem was that trained workers were in extraordinarily short supply. Kim himself realized the severity of this problem, saying in June 1946 that "If we have about 500 trained cadres, then we can dispatch one hundred to each of the [[Administrative divisions of North Korea|five provinces]] to solve the shortage problem. But, we do not have such trained cadres".&lt;ref&gt;Kim Il sung, "The Central Party School is a Communist University for the Education of Party Cadres, June 3, 1946", in "Collected Works of Kim Il-sung", 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Accordingly, he started to establish schools for the educating of bureaucrats who would be appointed to the party military and cabinet. In February 1946, Pyongyang Institute opened its doors to students who would soon become relatively high-ranking military leaders, and three months later, the Training Institute for Security Officers and the [[Central Party School of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Party School]] began educating military officers and party cadres respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Il-sung 's military thought, Institute for North Korean Studies, Seoul, 1978, p.223&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factions==
As the Workers' Party of Korea, and its two founding parties, had emerged through a series of mergers, it contained various competing factions. At the time of its foundation, the party was made up of four factions, the ''Soviet Koreans'' faction, the ''Domestic'' faction, the ''Yanan'' (or Chinese) faction and the ''Guerrilla'' faction.
* The ''Soviet Koreans'', led first by [[Alexei Ivanovich Hegay]] and then by [[Pak Chang Ok]] were made up of waves of ethnic Koreans who were born or raised in Russia after their families moved there starting in the 1870s. Some of them had returned to Korea covertly as Communist operatives in the twenties and thirties but most were members of the [[Red Army]] or civilians who were stationed in North Korea following [[World War II]] to help the Red Army establish a Soviet satellite. Many came as translators or as Russian language instructors.
* The ''Domestic'' faction, led by [[Pak Hon-yong]] were Korean Communists who never left the country but engaged in a struggle against the Japanese occupation. Many members of the domestic faction had spent time in Japanese military prisons as a result of their activities. They were the ones who agitated that the [[Korean People's Army]] take the lead in national reunification through military means.
* The ''[[Yenan group|Yanan faction]]'', led first by [[Mu Chong]] and then by [[Kim Tu-bong]] and [[Choe Chang-ik]], were those Korean exiles who had lived in China's [[Shaanxi]] province and joined the [[Communist Party of China]] whose regional headquarters were at [[Yan'an]]. They had formed their own party, the ''North-Chinese League for the Independence of Korea'', and when they returned to North Korea from exile they formed the ''New People's Party'' which merged with the North Korean Bureau to form the Workers Party of North Korea. Many members of the Yanan faction had fought in the Chinese 8th and New 4th Armies and thus had close relations with [[Mao Zedong]].
* The ''Guerrilla'' faction, led by Kim Il-sung, was made up of former Korean guerillas who had been active in [[Manchuria]] after it was occupied by Japan in 1931. Many in this group ended up fleeing Manchuria, as their armed resistance was suppressed, and moved to the Soviet Union where many of them, including Kim, were drafted into the Red Army.

Once the WPK was created there was a virtual parity between the four factions with the Yanan, Soviet and Domestic factions each having four representatives on the [[Politburo]] with the Guerrilla faction having three.

In the early years of the party, Kim Il-sung was the acknowledged leader, but he did not yet have absolute power, since it was necessary to balance off the interests of the various factions. To eliminate any threats to his position, he first moved against individual leaders who were potential rivals. He drove from power Alexei Ivanovich Hegay (also known as Hŏ Ka-i), leader of the Soviet faction, first demoting him during the Korean War in 1951 and then using him as a scapegoat for slow repairs of a water reservoir bombed by the Americans to drive him from power (and to an alleged suicide) in 1953. In part, it was possible for Kim to do this because the intervention of "Chinese People's Volunteers" in the war reduced the influence of both the USSR and the Soviet faction and allowed Kim Il-sung the room he needed to dispose of his main rival.

Kim Il-sung also attacked the leadership of the Yanan faction. When the North Koreans were driven to the Chinese border, Kim Il-sung needed a scapegoat to explain the military disaster and blamed [[Mu Chong]], a leader of the Yanan faction and also a leader of the [[North Korean military]]. Mu Chong and a number of other military leaders were expelled from the party and Mu was forced to return to China where he spent the rest of his life. Kim Il-sung also removed [[Pak Il-u]], the Minister of the Interior and reputedly the personal representative of [[Mao Zedong]].

The sacking of Hegay, Mu and Pak reduced the influence of the Chinese and Soviet factions, but Kim Il-sung could not yet launch an all out assault on these factions because he would risk the intervention of [[Moscow]] and [[Beijing]] when he was still dependent on their support.

==Purge of the "Domestic faction"==
As the [[Korean War]] drew to a close, Kim Il-sung first moved against the Domestic faction. While the Soviet faction had the sponsorship of the Soviet Union, and the Yanan faction was backed by China, the Domestic faction had no external sponsor who would come to their aid, and was therefore in the weakest position. With the end of the Korean War, the usefulness of the Domestic faction in running guerilla and spy networks in South Korea came to an end. Former leaders of the Workers Party of South Korea were attacked at a December 1952 Central Committee meeting. In early 1953, rumours were spread that the "southerners" had been planning a coup. This led to the arrest and removal from power of  [[Pak Hon-yong]] (who was foreign minister at the time) and [[Yi Sung Yop]] the minister of "state control" who was charged with "spying on behalf of the [[United States]]".&lt;ref name="The Real North Korea 2013"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Real North Korea | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Lankov, Andrei | year=2013 | pages=13 to 14 | isbn=978-0-19-996429-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 1953, following the signing of the [[armistice]] that suspended the Korean War, Yi and eleven other leaders of the domestic faction were subjected to a [[show trial]] on charges of planning a military coup and sentenced to death. In 1955, Pak Hon-yong, the former leader of the WPSK and deputy chairman of the WPK, was put on trial on charges of having been a US agent since 1939, sabotage, assassination, and planning a coup. He was sentenced to death, although it is unclear if he was shot immediately or if his execution occurred some time in 1956.&lt;ref name="The Real North Korea 2013"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Real North Korea | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Lankov, Andrei | year=2013 | pages=13 to 14 | isbn=978-0-19-996429-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trials of Yi and Pak were accompanied by the arrest of other members and activists of the former SWPK, with defendants being executed or sent to forced labour in the countryside.&lt;ref name="The Real North Korea 2013"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Real North Korea | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Lankov, Andrei | year=2013 | pages=13 to 14 | isbn=978-0-19-996429-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The domestic faction was virtually wiped out, though a few individual members who had personally allied themselves to Kim Il-sung remained in positions of influence for several more years.

==The "August Incident" and aftermath==
{{main|August Faction Incident}}
Kim Il-sung sent out preliminary signals in late 1955 and early 1956 that he was preparing to move against the Yanan and Soviet factions. The [[Twentieth Party Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]] was a bombshell with [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Secret Speech]] denouncing [[Joseph Stalin]] and the inauguration of [[destalinisation]]. Throughout the [[Soviet bloc]] domestic Communist parties inaugurated campaigns against [[cult of personality|personality cults]] and the [[general secretary|general secretaries]] who modelled themselves after Stalin were deposed throughout Eastern Europe.

Kim Il-sung was summoned to Moscow for six weeks in the summer of 1956 in order to receive a dressing down from Khrushchev, who wished to bring North Korea in line with the new orthodoxy. During Kim Il-sung's absence, [[Pak Chang Ok]] (the new leader of the Soviet faction after the suicide of Ho Ka Ai), [[Choe Chang Ik]], and other leading members of the Yanan faction devised a plan to attack Kim Il-sung at the next plenum of the Central Committee and criticise him for not "correcting" his leadership methods, developing a personality cult, distorting the "Leninist principle of collective leadership" his "distortions of socialist legality" (i.e. using arbitrary arrest and executions) and use other Khrushchev-era criticisms of [[Stalinism]] against Kim Il-sung's leadership.

Kim Il-sung became aware of the plan upon his return from Moscow and responded by delaying the plenum by almost a month and using the additional time to prepare by bribing and coercing Central Committee members and planning a stage-managed response. When the plenum finally opened on August 30 Choe Chang-ik made a speech attacking Kim Il-sung for concentrating the power of the party and the state in his own hands as well as criticising the party line on industrialisation which ignored widespread starvation among the [[North Korea|North Korean people]]. Yun Kong Hum attacked Kim Il-sung for creating a "police regime". Kim Il-sung's supporters heckled and berated the speakers rendering them almost inaudible and destroying their ability to persuade members. Kim Il-sung's supporters accused the opposition of being "anti-Party" and moved to expel Yun from the party. Kim Il-sung, in response, neutralised the attack on him by promising to inaugurate changes and moderate the regime, promises which were never kept. The majority in the committee voted to support Kim Il-sung and also voted in favour of repressing the opposition, expelling Choe and Pak from the Central Committee.

Several leaders of the Yunan faction fled to China to escape the purges that followed the August plenum, while supporters of the Soviet faction and Yanan faction were rounded up. Though [[Kim Tu Bong]], the leader of the Yanan faction and nominal President of North Korea, was not directly involved in the attempt on Kim, he was ultimately purged in 1958, accused of being the "mastermind" of the plot. Kim Tu Bong "disappeared" after his removal from power, and likely was either executed or died in prison.

In September 1956, a joint Soviet-Chinese delegation went to Pyongyang to "instruct" Kim Il-sung to cease any purge and reinstate the leaders of the Yanan and Soviet factions. A second plenum of the Central Committee, held on September 23, 1956, officially pardoned the leaders of the August opposition attempt and rehabilitated them, but in 1957 the purges resumed, and, by 1958, the Yanan faction had ceased to exist. Members of the Soviet faction, meanwhile, facing increased harassment, decided to return to the Soviet Union in increasing numbers. By 1961, the only faction left was Kim Il-sung's own guerrilla faction, along with members who had joined the WPK under Kim Il-sung's leadership and were loyal to him. In the 1961 Central Committee, there were only two members of the Soviet faction, three members of the Yanan faction and three members of the Domestic faction left out of a total Central Committee membership of 68. These individuals were personally loyal to Kim Il-sung and were trusted by him; however, by the late 1960s, even these individuals were almost all purged.

One likely reason for the failure of the Soviet and Yanan factions to depose Kim Il-sung was the nationalist view by younger members of the party who had joined since 1950 that the members of these factions were "foreigners" influenced by alien powers while Kim Il-sung was seen as a true Korean.

According to Kim Il-sung’s biographer, Dae sook suh: "His (Kim’s) long struggle to consolidate power was complete... There were no longer any factions to challenge his position, and, for the first time, no foreign armed forces were occupying the North".&lt;ref&gt;Suh, Kim Il-Sung&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Sino-Soviet Split==
Until the 1960s, the regime in the DPRK was seen as an orthodox Communist one-party state, with power residing in the Communist Party. All industry was [[nationalization|nationalised]] and all agriculture was collectivised on the Soviet model, and the party controlled this [[command economy]] at every level. All other political organisation was suppressed and [[civil society]] was extinguished. A pervasive [[political police]] apparatus suppressed all [[dissent]]. Even at this stage, there was a [[personality cult]] of Kim Il-sung, but it was usually assumed in the West that the DPRK was a Soviet satellite like [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] or [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] though, in reality, this had stopped being the case after 1956.

The [[Sino-Soviet split]] helped Kim Il-sung take the Workers' Party of Korea on an independent path between Moscow and Beijing. The party and Kim Il-sung in particular were wary of [[de-stalinization]] and of Khrushchev's reforms. In the late 1950s, the DPRK began to increasingly emulate the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), launching its own version of the [[Great Leap Forward]] calling it the ''Chollima'' movement. The press did not mention the Sino-Soviet split at first. In 1961, Kim Il-sung signed a treaty of friendship and mutual cooperation with [[Zhou Enlai]] and then proceeded to sign a similar treaty with the Soviet Union. After 1962 and particularly after the Twenty-Second CPSU Party Congress in which Soviet leaders criticised Chinese leaders, the WPK began to side openly with the PRC not only on issues such as the personality cult and [[anti-revisionism]] but also against Khrushchev's theory of [[peaceful coexistence]]. Editorials began to appear in the press openly criticising the Soviet position and defending the Chinese and obliquely attacking Khrushchev. The WPK supported the [[Sino-Indian War|PRC during its conflict]] with [[India]] in 1962 and denounced the USSR's "capitulation" in the [[Cuban missile crisis]].

The Soviet Union responded by cutting off all aid to the DPRK, seriously damaging North Korea's industry and military capability. PRC did not have the resources to replace the Soviet aid and, after 1965, was embroiled in the chaos of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Events in PRC shocked the WPK leadership and caused it to distance itself from PRC and criticise Mao's "dogmatism" and recklessness, even accusing the Chinese of adopting the "Trotskyist theory of [[permanent revolution]]", a serious heresy in the Communist world. The Chinese [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] began to attack Kim Il-sung and Korean domestic and foreign policy. After 1965, North Korea took a neutral stand in the Sino-Soviet conflict, backing away from its previous uncritical support of PRC.

Although Kim Il-sung's regime emulated some of the slogans of the [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Cultural Revolution]], Kim Il-sung remained wary of Chinese domination and never applied anything like the Cultural Revolution in North Korea. In the same year, DPRK forces captured the U.S.S. ''[[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|Pueblo]]'', an American spy ship, showing that Kim Il-sung was running his own version of the [[Cold War]], independent of Soviet or Chinese tutelage.

==Juche and Kim Il-sung as supreme leader==
[[File:Headquarters Workers' Party of Korea.jpg|thumb|230px|Party headquarters in [[Kim Il-sung Square]], [[Pyongyang]]]]

After 1956, Kim Il-sung was no longer a Soviet puppet and the DPRK moved away from being a Soviet satellite or "people's democracy". Nor did he trust the Chinese due to their suspected support of the Yanan faction's move against Kim Il-sung. Rather, he pursued an independent policy and initiated his [[Juche]] program of national self-reliance in order to diminish the influence of the USSR and China over domestic North Korean affairs. The program was officially launched in June 1966 (after the state visit of the Soviet Foreign Minister) as the ''program of national self-determination and Communist and Workers' Parties' non-interference''. By the late 1960s, the North Korean media was hailing the Juche ideology as being superior to Leninism{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and other foreign ideologies and "burning loyalty" to the "Great Leader" became a major ideological theme (the term "Great Leader" was first used in the early 1960s) and took the Stalinistic practice of the personality cult to new levels.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

With the removal of the other factions, Kim Il-sung became the supreme leader of the DPRK. By 1960, Kim Il-sung had purged virtually all the members of the Yanan, Domestic, and Soviet factions through show trials, intimidation, and encouraging Soviet Koreans to return to the USSR, leaving the party to be dominated by his "''guerrilla comrades''" as well as young technocrats who had joined the party after its founding and were loyal to Kim Il-sung.

In 1972, the DPRK adopted a new constitution, under which an executive presidency was created, and Kim Il-sung became President as well as the WPK's General Secretary. Thereafter, Kim Il-sung's personality cult reached heights that made even Stalin and Mao appear modest by comparison.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Kim Il-sung was credited with personal direction of every supposed achievement of the regime, his biography was rewritten to make him the founder and leader of the WPK from its inception, and a new ideology of Kim Il-sung's creation, ''Juche'' or self-reliance, replaced [[Marxism–Leninism]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} as the regime's official ideology. All other WPK leaders remained completely anonymous, although Kim Il-sung's power in fact depended on the control of the [[Korean People's Army]] and the security forces by his loyal agent, Defence Minister [[Oh Jin-wu]]. Kim Jong-il explains in ''Socialism of Our Country is Socialism of Our Style as the Embodiment of the Juche Idea'', a speech made to the [[central committee]] of the WPK on December 27, 1990, the divorce with Marxism–Leninism. "We could not literally accept the Marxist theory which had been advanced on the premises of the socio-historic conditions of the developed European capitalist countries, or the Leninist theory presented in the situation of Russia where capitalism was developed to the second grade. We had had to find a solution to every problem arising in the revolution ... from the standpoint of Juche".{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The practical effect of ''Juche'' was to seal the DPRK off from virtually all foreign trade, except to a limited extent with China and the Soviet Union. But, the economic reforms of [[Deng Xiaoping]] in China after 1978 meant that trade with the undeveloped centrally-planned economy of the DPRK held decreasing interest for China, while the fall of communism in the Soviet Union in 1991 completed the DPRK's isolation. This, added to the continuing high level of expenditure on armaments, led to a steadily mounting economic crisis from the 1980s onwards.

==The rise of Kim Jong-il==
Kim Jong-il had been groomed to become his father's successor for a long time. In 1964, he was appointed Central Committee member, then promoted to Politburo member and designated successor to Kim Il-sung in 1974 by a Central Committee plenum. 

After Kim Jong-il assumed the position of party secretary in charge of organization and propaganda in September 1973, his involvement in party affairs enhanced their organizational strength and discipline. With his elevated position in the party, Kim Jong-il rigidly implemented two policies: an enhancement of the role of full-time party cadres in local and administrative units and a strengthening of party-life criticism in every unit of the workplace as well as in the party. This establishment of a strong disciplinarty tradition in the party contributed to the maintenance of social control. It has become an important foundation for the persistence of the existing authority structure centered on the father and the son.&lt;ref&gt;Byoung-Lo Philo Kim, Two Koreas in Development: A comparative study of Principles and strategies of Capitalist and Communist Third World Development, pp.120-130&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1980, the WPK Congress elevated Kim Jong-il to senior positions and publicized his status as [[heir apparent]]. Until then, it seemed likely that Kim's successor would be either Oh Jin-wu or Prime Minister [[Kim Il (Premier of North Korea)|Kim Il]] (not related to Kim Il-sung). In fact, it seems that Kim Il-sung had always planned that his son would succeed him, and had been advancing him within the Army (the real source of power in the DPRK) since 1974. Kim Il was removed from office in 1976 and died in 1984, and Oh remained loyal to the Kim family. Well before Kim Il-sung's death in 1994, Kim Jong-il had become the day-to-day ruler of the country, and had promoted his own followers to key positions in the Army. Kim Jong-il's accession was followed by a round of purges in the WPK, in which some of his father's old followers were removed from office.

===The 6th Party Congress and the party's decline===
{{see|6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea}}
WPK congresses and plenums became less and less frequent, and their deliberations less and less substantive. Part of the reason for the “subservience” of the delegates appears to be the significant turnover between congresses: between 41 and 72 percent of the members of Central Committees selected at each party congress were new to their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Buzo, The Guerilla Dynasty: Politics and Leadership in North Korea, Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1999, p.31, Table 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the almighty status and power of the WPK, it has never functioned according to regulations, a fact that became even worse after Kim Il-Sung's death. A party congress has not been held since the [[6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea|sixth party congress]] in 1980. According to the Party Rules, a party congress is supposed to be held every five years. The plenum of the Central Committee has not been held since the 21st Plenum in December 1993. The plenum, which has the right to elect the General Secretary, was not held even when Kim Jong-il became the party's general secretary in October 1997. Instead Kim Jong-il was endorsed by both the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission on ground of petitions and letters from lower organizations. For the first time in the history of Workers' Party of Korea, a plenum also was not held before the first session of newly elected SPAs. It is also suspected that Secretariat has not held a meeting since Kim Il-sung's death, while the last known Politburo meeting before 2010 was held in 1994.

In the wake of the revision of the constitution in 1998, making the National Defense Commission the highest state body, there had been a dramatic reshuffling of the official leadership rankings. The elevation of the NDC to preeminent status placed Kim’s unique stamp on the North Korean regime through the creation of a quasi-wartime crisis management system.

=== 2007–2010 ===
The Party was given new prominence starting from 2007–2008: in 2007, the Administration Department was re-established with [[Chang Song-taek]] as director, and in 2009 [[Choe Yong-rim]] was appointed chief secretary of the [[Pyongyang]] Party Committee filling a 9-year vacancy.

In 2009, South Korea’s government released the latest constitution of North Korea which codified the prevailing ideology of party and government. It omitted all mention of communism. A press representative also explained to South Korean officials that communism is not considered viable "as long as U.S. imperialism exists".&lt;ref name=Myers_Constitution&gt;[[Brian Reynolds Myers|Brian R.

===The 2010 Party Conference===
On 26 June 2010, the Party Politburo called the 3rd Party Conference for early September; after an unexplained delay, the Conference was held on 28 September; it re-elected Kim Jong-il as Party General Secretary, renewed the Party Central Committee with Kim Jong-il's son Kim Jong-un as member, and adopted new Party Rules which eliminated the clause that a party congress must be convened every 5 years, increased the power of the Central Military Commission, and inserted a praise to Kim Jong-il in the preface.&lt;ref&gt;Ken E. Gause, ''North Korea Under Kim Chong-il. Power, Politics and Prospects for Change.''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Partycongress.jpg|thumb|August 2010 Pyongyang propaganda proclaims "Greet the conference of the Workers' Party of Korea as an auspicious event which will shine forever in the history of our party and country!"]]
On 28 September 2010, a Central Committee plenum (the first after 17 years) was held as well, renewing central authorities and appointing Kim Jong-un a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission.

On 6 June 2011, North Korean press publicized a Politburo enlarged meeting, the first of this kind since the 1980s. The meeting was almost entirely focused on Kim Jong-il's recent visit to the [[People's Republic of China]], adding further speculation on China's endorsement of Kim Jong-il's succession as well as signalling the DPRK's increasing interest for Chinese economic reforms.

===The rise of Kim Jong-un===
After Kim Jong-il [[Death and funeral of Kim Jong-il|died]] on 17 December 2011, North Korean elites moved to consolidate Kim Jong-un's position. He was declared to be in charge of the country as soon as the official report on Kim Jong-il's death was published on 19 December. On 26 December 2011, the official newspaper ''[[Rodong Sinmun]]'' hailed him as supreme leader of the party and the state. On 30 December, a meeting of the Politburo officially appointed him [[Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army]], after he was allegedly nominated for the position by Kim Jong-il himself in October 2011 (the anniversary of Kim Jong-il's assumption of general-secretaryship).

Despite being not even a Politburo member, Kim Jong-un was nevertheless proclaimed to the unofficial position of supreme leader of the Workers' Party of Korea. Key posts as general secretary, chairman of the [[Central Military Commission (North Korea)|Central Military Commission]], and [[Chairman of the National Defence Commission of North Korea|Chairman of the National Defence Commission]], as well as two seats in the five-member Politburo Presidium, remained vacant.

After celebrations for Kim Jong-il's 70th anniversary (during which he was elevated to the rank of [[Taewonsu]], usually translated as [[Grand Marshal]] or [[Generalissimo]]), on 18 February the Politburo announced the convening of the 4th Party Conference for mid-April 2012 (near the 100th birth anniversary of Kim Il-sung) "to glorify the sacred revolutionary life and feats of Kim Jong Il for all ages and accomplish the Juche cause, the Songun revolutionary cause, rallied close around Kim Jong Un."&lt;ref name=4thconference&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-02/20/c_131419697.htm DPRK's ruling party to convene conference in April]&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the provincial party conferences endorsed the election of Kim Jong-un as a delegate to the 4th Party Conference. According to KCNA, provincial party conferences were held in Jagang, South Hwanghae, North Pyongan, and Kangwon and a city party conference was held in Rason (Rajin-Sonbong is one of three province-level cities). On 26 March 2012, Kim was elected a delegate to the 4th Party Conference by the party organization of the [[Korean People’s Army]].

At the 4th Party Conference on 11 April, Kim Jong-il was declared to be the Eternal General Secretary and Kim Jong-un was elected to the newly created post of [[First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea]], as well as Politburo Presidium member. The Conference also proclaimed [[Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism]] "as the only guiding idea of the party".&lt;ref name=4thconference2&gt;[http://www.rodong.rep.kp/InterEn/index.php?strPageID=SF01_02_01&amp;newsID=2012-04-12-0006 4th Party Conference of WPK Held, ''Rodong Sinmun'', 12 April 2012.]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:999LakeShoreDriveChicago.jpg|thumb|right|325px|999 N. Lake Shore Drive, a co-op owned residential building in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States.]]

A '''housing cooperative''', '''co-op''', or '''housing company''' (especially in Finland&lt;ref&gt;"Asunto-osakeyhtiö" in Finnish, most similar to "bostadsrättsförening" in Sweden today, where the term and organizations called "bostadsaktiebolag" are nowadays rare, but they are still very common in Swedish in Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;), is a legal entity, usually a [[cooperative]] or a [[corporation]], which owns [[real estate]], consisting of one or more residential buildings; it is one type of [[housing tenure]]. Housing cooperatives are a distinctive form of home ownership that have many characteristics that differ from other residential arrangements such as [[single family home]] ownership, [[condominium]]s and [[renting]].&lt;ref name="nationalcooperativelawcenter.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalcooperativelawcenter.com/what-is-a-housing-cooperative/the-characteristics-of-housing-cooperatives/|title=The Characteristics of Housing Cooperatives|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corporation is membership-based, with membership granted by way of a share purchase in the cooperative. Each [[shareholder]] in the legal entity is granted the right to occupy one housing unit. A primary advantage of the housing cooperative is the pooling of the members' resources so that their buying power is leveraged, thus lowering the cost per member in all the services and products associated with home ownership.

Another key element in some forms of housing cooperatives (but not Finnish housing companies, for example) is that the members, through their elected [[Representation (politics)|representatives]], screen and select who may live in the cooperative, unlike any other form of home ownership. 

Housing cooperatives fall into two general tenure categories: non-ownership (referred to as non-equity or continuing) and ownership (referred to as equity or strata). In non-equity cooperatives, occupancy rights are sometimes granted subject to an occupancy agreement, which is similar to a [[lease]]. In [[Equity (finance)|equity]] cooperatives, occupancy rights are sometimes granted by way of the purchase agreements and legal instruments registered on the title. The corporation's articles of incorporation and bylaws as well as occupancy agreement specifies the cooperative's rules.

The word ''cooperative'' is also used to describe a non-share capital co-op model in which fee-paying members obtain the right to occupy a bedroom and share the communal resources of a house that is owned by a cooperative organization. Such is the case with [[Student housing cooperative|student cooperatives]] in some college and university communities across the United States.

==Legal status==
As a legal entity, a co-op can contract with other companies or hire individuals to provide it with services, such as a maintenance contractor or a building manager. It can also hire employees, such as a manager or a caretaker, to deal with specific things that volunteers may prefer not to do or may not be good at doing, such as electrical maintenance. However, as many housing cooperatives strive to run self-sufficiently, as much work as possible is completed by its members.

In non-equity cooperatives and in limited equity cooperatives,&lt;ref&gt;Mallin, Barry. [http://www.uhab.org/sites/default/files/doc_library/Limited_Equity_Cooperatives_A_Legal_Handbook_0.pdf "Limited Equit Cooperatives: A Legal Handbook"] New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, ndg&lt;/ref&gt; a shareholder in a co-op does not own real estate, but a share of the legal entity that does own real estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooplaw.com/Co-op_Apartments/co-op%20apartments.html|title=A New York Co-op Apartment Lawyer: Co-op Boards, Shareholders, Managing Agents, and Commercial Tenants|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-operative ownership is quite distinct from [[condominium]]s where people own individual units and have little say in who moves into the other units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ny-condos.com/condo-coop.html|title=Condo vs. Co-op Apartment: The New York City Real Estate Question for Buyers, Sellers and Investors|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, most jurisdictions have developed separate legislation, similar to laws that regulate companies, to regulate how co-ops are operated and the rights and obligations of shareholders.

==Ownership==
{{See also|Strata title}}
Each resident or resident household has membership in the co-operative [[homeowner association|association]]. In non-equity cooperatives, members have occupancy rights to a specific suite within the housing co-operative as outlined in their "occupancy agreement", or "proprietary lease",&lt;ref&gt;Romano, Jay. [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/17/realestate/your-home-proprietary-co-op-lease-new-model.html "Your Home; Proprietary Co-op Lease: New Model"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (December 12, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; which is essentially a lease. In ownership cooperatives, occupancy rights are transferred to the purchaser by way of the title transfer.

Since the housing cooperative holds title to all the property and housing structures, it bears the cost of maintaining, repairing and replacing them. This relieves the member from the cost and burden of such work. In that sense, the housing cooperative is like the landlord in a rental setting. However, another hallmark of cooperative living is that it is [[nonprofit]], so that the work is done at cost, with no profit motive involved.&lt;ref name="nationalcooperativelawcenter.com"/&gt;

In some cases, the co-op follows [[Rochdale Principles]] where each [[shareholder]] has only one vote. Most cooperatives are incorporated as [[Limited liability company|limited stock companies]] where the number of votes an owner has is tied to the number of shares owned by the person. Whichever form of voting is employed it is necessary to conduct an election among shareholders to determine who will represent them on the board of directors (if one exists), the governing body of the co-operative. The [[board of directors]] is generally responsible for the business decisions including the financial requirements and sustainability of the co-operative. Although politics vary from co-op to co-op and depend largely on the wishes of its members, it is a general rule that a majority vote of the board is necessary to make business decisions.

==Management==
In larger co-ops, members of a co-op typically elect a [[board of directors]] from amongst the shareholders at a general meeting, usually the [[annual general meeting]]. In smaller co-ops, all members sit on the board.

A housing cooperative's board of directors is elected by the membership, providing a voice and representation in the governance of the property. Rules are determined by the board, providing a flexible means of addressing the issues that arise in a community to assure the members' peaceful possession of their homes.&lt;ref name="nationalcooperativelawcenter.com"/&gt;

==Finance==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
A housing cooperative is normally ''[[de facto]]'' [[non-profit]], since usually most of its income comes from the rents paid by its residents (if in a formal corporation, then shareholders), who are invariably its members. There is no point in creating a deliberate surplus—except for operational requirements such as setting aside funds for replacement of assets—since that simply means that the rents paid by members are set higher than the expenses. (Note, however, that it's quite possible for a housing co-op to own other revenue-generating assets, such as a subsidiary business which could produce surplus income to offset the cost of the housing, but in those cases the housing rents are usually reduced to compensate for the additional revenue.)

New co-ops are often founded by the builder, who resigns from the co-op when all the shares have been sold. It is relatively difficult to start a housing co-op from scratch because if the idea is, for instance, to build a building or group of buildings to house the members, this usually takes a significant [[mortgage loan]] for which a financial institution will want assurances of responsibility. It may also take a year or more for the members to organize the design and construction, as well as time and foresight to establish even basic organizational policies. It is rare that these kinds of skills of organization are available in a random group of people who often have pressures on their existing housing. It may be somewhat easier to organize a group of closely related housing units. This opportunity may arise, for example, if an existing apartment building's owner is thinking about selling it. 

In the lifecycle of buildings, the replacement of assets (capital repairs) requires significant funds which can be obtained through a variety of ways: assessments on current owners; sales of Treasury Stock (former rental units) to new shareholders; draw downs of reserves; unsecured loans; operating surpluses; fees on the sales of units between shareholders and new and increases to existing mortgages.

There are housing co-ops of the rich and famous: [[John Lennon]], for instance, lived in [[The Dakota]], a housing co-operative,
and most apartments in [[New York City]] that are owned rather than rented are held through a co-operative
rather than via a [[condominium]] arrangement.

===Market-rate and limited-equity co-ops===
There are two main types of housing co-operative share pricing: market rate and limited equity. With market rate, the share price is allowed to rise on the open market and shareholders may sell at whatever price the market will bear when they want to move out. In many ways market rate is thus similar financially to owning a condominium, with the difference being that often the co-op may carry a mortgage, resulting in a much higher monthly fee paid to the co-op than would be so in a condominium. The purchase price of a comparable unit in the co-op is typically much lower, however.

With limited equity, the co-op has rules regarding pricing of shares when sold. The idea behind limited equity is to maintain [[affordable housing]]. A sub-set of the limited equity model is the no-equity model, which looks very much like renting, with a very low purchase price (comparable to a rental security deposit) and a monthly fee in lieu of rent. When selling, all that is re-couped is that very low purchase price.

==By country==

===Canada===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2017}}
Housing co-ops in Canada have many different organizational forms. In Ontario, there are co-ownership, equity and occupant-run co-ops. In Alberta, housing co-ops are either non-equity (also referred to as "continuing co-ops") and ownership (also referred to as "strata-title co-ops"). Given that each Province has different legislation under which co-operative housing communities are incorporated and organized, descriptions of the different ownership housing co-op forms pertain often only to the Province in which they exist.

Non-equity continuing housing co-operatives exist in all provinces and territories and share common features. They can be any housing form: single detached, duplex, town-home and apartment. Their main common denominator is that once built and occupied, the co-op continues to own 100% of the units and each member/shareholder is entitled to occupy a home on the basis of some form of contract or housing agreement. Members pay a monthly fee which covers all of the co-op's costs including mortgage payments, taxes, operating costs and building replacement reserve fund allocations.

In Alberta, ownership co-ops were introduced in 1987 with the building of a twin high-rise tower development in Edmonton (Riverwind Strata Title Housing Co-operative). Subsequently ownership co-ops have been developed and built in other urban centres such as Calgary, Fort Saskatchewan, Canmore and Banff. The individual units within these co-op developments are sub-divided by using the strata title provision of the Land Titles Act, thus creating individual three-dimensional strata lots. This strata sub-division is registered at Land Titles, thus creating "air" lots which have the same properties as more commonly known two-dimensional land lots. In this fashion, co-op members can purchase their individual units and can register a mortgage on title. Like the continuing co-op's, ownership co-op's can be any housing form. Strata lots in Alberta are not to be confused with strata lots in British Columbia.

Co-ownership co-ops are generally older apartment buildings, incorporated before the Ontario Condominium Act, 1973 came into existence, where shareholders each own one voting share in the corporation that owns the building and have a registered right to occupy individual units as described on their share certificate. Most of these types of co-ops date from the thirties, forties and fifties and are located in the City of Toronto. They are similar to condominiums, in that units may be bought and sold by private sale or on the open market. Until relatively recently, these units tended to be bought by older people with home equity who could buy the unit outright, as it was difficult to get a mortgage against these units. However, a number of Ontario [[credit unions]] are now offering limited financing, provided that that individual co-op corporations meet their fiscal standards, making these units [[affordable housing]] options for younger buyers. Incoming owners must be approved by the building's Board of Directors, and agree to abide by building by-laws and Occupancy Agreements.

Equity co-ops are buildings in which individuals purchase a percentage share of the building and the land on which it is built tied to the square footage of their unit; all owners own the building collectively, with exclusive rights to occupy their own unit. More credit unions will offer financing against them than against co-ownerships. They are a relatively new form of construction, designed to encourage owner occupancy by having the building's corporation hold back a percentage of the unit's share equity to ensure owner occupancy. This legal structure is used as an alternative to condominium registration, either when the government will not allow conversion of an existing apartment building to a condominium, or to avoid the expense and difficulty of doing so.

Then there are co-ops that provide all the privileges of ownership except for the right to make (or lose) money on a primary residence and are run by the people who live there.

The federal and provincial governments in [[Canada]] developed legislation in the 1970s that assisted new housing co-ops by providing start-up funding and financing through mortgages insured by the [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] (CMHC), a federal government agency. The government simultaneously began to encourage the development of co-operative development resource groups to contract with fledgling boards of directors of housing co-ops to develop co-operatives in existing multi-residential properties, in turnkey buildings or buildings designed and constructed by architects and builders with which the board contracted to deliver the service. Supervised by the board, the resource groups marketed the units to suitable members, educated them about their rights and obligations as co-operators, and established a management structure which usually included co-op employees or property management companies. Resource groups helped in forming initial policies and holding the organization together as the co-operative was developed and occupied.

The federal government tied its loan assistance to requirements that these housing co-ops provide a percentage of their units, usually at least 15 to 20 per cent, for what are termed income-tested residents. These people voluntarily provide information to the co-op on a confidential basis about their gross income, and their monthly housing charge (rent)is then calculated according to a formula. If the calculated charge is less than the market rent of the units, then the federal government, through another formula, would provide funding to those units to bring their unit revenue up to the market rate. This produced mixed-income co-op housing, in which relatively well-off people lived side-by-side with relatively low-income people and worked with them on committees. This often had the ripple effect of improving the financial health of those less well-off.

Depending on one's political point of view, such government payments for offsetting the housing charge could be considered a subsidy of the low-income members, or a contractual business arrangement between the government and the co-op, which helps to stabilize revenue to the co-op in exchange for accomplishing a social goal for the government for a specific period. This dichotomy is typical of the fact that a housing co-op is somewhere between a private business corporation and a social agency, and where one places it depends on one's viewpoint—and the collective viewpoint of each housing co-op. Some observers would now simply categorize these co-op as a form of social enterprise.

Political will dissipated in Canada in the 1990s, however, as other issues occupied politicians and financial belt-tightening by the governments reduced the funds available for the mortgages. In 2004 and 2005, however, the political winds shifted back towards the idea of developing more low-income housing. However, not-for-profit housing co-operatives are committed to the mixed-income concept and have not been able to make much use of the few opportunities that have come available in recent years. Also, the term of many of the government agreements concerning funding for housing subsidies are coming to an end, provoking a debate in individual co-ops and the co-op movement on the extent to which co-ops should continue to be mixed-income forms of housing.

In Canada, there are number of secondary and tertiary associations of housing co-operatives. The major national organization is the Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada (CHF Canada). Most provinces have similar organizations for their area, but many are stand-alone members of the CHF Canada, as opposed to being branches of it. Each such organization charges its member co-operatives a fee based on the number of housing units in the co-op to pay for staff to do its work. This includes advocacy to governments, setting up self-help funding and the like. These organizations do not act for individual members, and do not give members advice when the member encounters problems with the Board of their co-op. In most jurisdictions there are no organizations for members of housing co-operatives, in contrast with tenants in a traditional landlord-and-tenant relationship, who can be assisted by various tenant advocacy groups.

In Ontario, the eviction of members of a housing co-operative is governed by special section of legislation set out in the Co-operative Corporations Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90c35_e.htm#BK210 Co-operative Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, Chapter C.35: Non-Profit Housing Co-Operatives]. Retrieved 14 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Prior to a formal hearing to terminate a member's occupancy some co-operatives issue a "Notice of Concern" to request the member to attend a Board of Directors meeting to attempt to resolve an issue of arrears or other behaviour contravening the co-operative's Occupancy By-law.

If the Board of Directors of the co-operative cannot resolve the member issue, which is a cause for possible termination of occupancy rights, it can pass a motion to send the member a notice to appear requiring the member to attend at a Board meeting at which the termination (eviction) of that member's occupancy will be considered. If the Board votes to terminate an occupancy (evict), the member has a right of appeal to the membership as a whole. In order to enforce the eviction, the Board must bring an application to a judge of the Superior Court, on which occasion the member has the opportunity to present his/her case to the judge; the judge considers whether the eviction process was conducted fairly and in accordance with due process, and has a residual discretion to refuse the eviction should the judge consider it fair to do so, notwithstanding the decision of the Board. Sometimes this hearing is conducted like a trial, with oral evidence from both sides, while at other times it is conducted based only on written documents submitted to the court; the practice varies from judge-to-judge and courthouse to courthouse, and there is no consensus on the proper procedure or what right a member has to be heard. This process is different from evictions of rental tenants, which proceed in Ontario before a specialized tribunal and in which the tenant is always entitled to an oral hearing. The standard of deference that judges should show to the decisions of Boards is a controversial and unresolved issue in the law, with various cases taking seemingly inconsistent positions on the issue. As of 2012 new provincial legislation in Ontario will allow housing co-operatives to apply to a special tribunal to obtain a "writ of possession" to evict a member from their unit.

A co-operative housing community can take many forms: a traditional apartment building, scattered single family homes, townhouses or it can be the basis of an [[intentional community]] or a "living co-op". Student housing co-operatives also can be found in many parts of Canada including Kingston, Guelph, Waterloo and Toronto, Ontario; New Westminster, British Columbia; Edmonton, Alberta; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Montreal, Quebec; and Fredericton, New Brunswick.

"[[Building co-operatives]]" ("self-build housing co-operatives" in British parlance, which distinguishes them from worker co-operatives in the building trade) are formed by members who co-operate to build their homes but own their houses on completion. Some co-ops continue to own common elements such as roads, parks, water systems, etc. Building co-ops were extremely popular across Canada from the 1930s to the 1960s. [[Jimmy Tompkins (priest)|Father Jimmy Tompkins]] helped to pioneer this concept at Tompkinsville at Reserve Mines on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia.

===Finland===
In [[Finland]] holding shares in a housing company is a common form of real estate and home ownership. Owning an apartment in Finland usually means owning shares in a housing company; ownership of a certain set of shares in turn confers the right to use a certain part of the building owned by the company.

Except for a very limited number of co-ops that follow the strict [[Rochdale Principles]] of one vote, all Finnish housing cooperatives are incorporated as (non-profit) [[limited-liability company|limited-liability companies]] ({{lang-fi|asunto-[[osakeyhtiö]]}}, {{lang-sv|bostadsaktiebolag}}), where one share usually represents one square meter of the apartment, but may represent the whole apartment. Housing companies are regulated by Finnish law as a particular type of corporation.

Housing company shares typically trade on the open market, most often through real estate agents. No board approval is needed to buy shares. In some older companies existing share holders have the right of [[Pre-emption rights|pre-emption]], i.e. the right to buy the shares at the set market price.

There is usually no requirement for share holders to live in the co-operative. Owning apartments for rent is a common form of saving and private investment. There may be provisions against owning shares for more than one apartment in the same co-op.

The first housing cooperatives were built around 1900, many of them in the [[Helsinki]] neighborhood of [[Katajanokka]], in the [[National romanticism|national romantic]] [[Jugend]] style. Initially many co-ops were set up by the future members themselves, often workers or [[artisans]] in the same trade. By the 1920s co-op founding was the business of professional real estate developers. After [[World War II]] nationwide non-profit developer organizations were formed and a system of government provided loans (ARAVA) was introduced. Sale of shares in housing companies with state loans were restricted by limited equity rules for 50 years, the price of the shares was limited by an index.

The Finnish model of the housing company was also the basis of the modern U.S. co-ops, as the first cooperative, the Finnish Home Building Association in [[Finntown (Brooklyn, New York)]], was started in 1918 by Finnish immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coophousing.org/HistoryofCo-ops.pdf Coophousing.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203142518/http://www.coophousing.org/HistoryofCo-ops.pdf |date=2007-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0254/is_4_59/ai_68704399 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040929001436/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0254/is_4_59/ai_68704399 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-09-29 |work=[[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]] |title=Lessons from the History of Affordable Housing Cooperatives in the United States: A Case Study in American Affordable Housing Policy |first=Gerald W. |last=Sazama |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In 2013, the opening of ''La Maison des Babayagas'', an innovative housing co-op in Paris, gained world-wide attention. It was formed as a self-help community and built with financial assistance from the municipal government, specifically for female senior citizens. Located in the Paris suburb of [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]] after many years of planning, it looks like any other apartment building. The senior citizens stay out of nursing homes, by staying active, alert, and assisting one another.&lt;ref name='lib'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/economie/2014/02/02/les-babayagas-la-silver-solidarite-au-quotidien_977239|title=Les Babayagas, la silver solidarité au quotidien|work=Libération.fr|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lamaisondesbabayagas.fr/|title=Félicitations !|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the Baba Yaga Association is to create and develop an innovative lay residence for aging women that is: (1) self-managed, without hierarchy and without supervision; (2) united collective, with regard to finances as well as daily life; (3) citizen civic-minded, through openness to the community /city and through mutual interaction, engaging in its political, cultural and social life in a spirit of  participatory democracy; (4) ecological in all aspects of life, in conformity with the values and actions expressed in the Charter of Living of the House of Babayagas.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Generally, the association's activities are tied to the purpose above, in particular the development of a popular entity called the University of Knowledge of the Elderly (UNISAVIE: Université du savoir des vieux), and the initiation of a movement to promote other living places that are organized into similar networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lamaisondesbabayagas.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/unisavie_pdf.pdf|title=Félicitations !|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006065847/http://lamaisondesbabayagas.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/unisavie_pdf.pdf|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community charter sets out expectations for privacy. Each apartment is self-contained. Monthly meetings assure the optimal routines of the building and ensures that each person may participate fully and with complete liberty of expression. Plans set out the routine intervention of a mediator who could help get to the bottom of the causes of eventual conflicts in order to allow for their resolution.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The success of the Paris co-op inspired several Canadian grassroots groups to adopt similar values in senior housing initiatives; these values include autonomy and self-management, solidarity and mutual aid, civic engagement, and ecological responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/thesundayedition/documentaries/2013/08/11/baba-yagas-house/|title=Home - The Sunday Edition  - CBC Radio|website=Cbc.ca|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the [[Industrialisation]] in the 19th century there were many housing cooperatives founded in Germany. Presently, there are over 2,000 housing cooperatives with over two million apartments and over three million members in Germany. The public housing cooperatives are organised in the [[GdW Bundesverband deutscher Wohnungs- und Immobilienunternehmen]] (The Federal association of German housing and real estate enterprise registered associations).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-17570-2_2|title=Neue Wohnungsgemeinnützigkeit|last=Kuhnert|first=Jan|last2=Leps|first2=Olof|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden|isbn=9783658175696|pages=33–56|language=de|doi=10.1007/978-3-658-17570-2_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In India most 'flats' are owned outright. i.e. the title to each individual flat is separate. There is usually a governing body/society/association to administer maintenance and other building needs. These are comparable to the Condominium Buildings in the USA. The laws governing the building, its governing body and how flats within the building are transferred differ from state to state.

Certain buildings are organized as "Cooperative Housing Societies" where one actually owns a share in the Cooperative rather than the flat itself. This structure was very popular in the past but has become less common in recent times. Most states have separate laws governing Cooperative Housing Societies.

===The Netherlands===
[[File:Eerste Jacob van Campenstraat VAK.jpg|thumbnail|right|Typical cheap late 19th century corporation housing in Amsterdam]]
In the Netherlands there are two very different types of organization that could be considered a housing cooperative:

====Housing corporation====
A ''housing corporation'' (''woningcorporatie'') is a [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to building and maintaining housing for rent for people with lower income. The first housing corporations started in the second half of the 19th century as small cooperative associations. The first such association in the world, ''VAK'' ("association for the working class") was founded in 1852 in [[Amsterdam]]. Between 2.4 and 2.5 million apartments in the Netherlands are rented by the housing corporations, i.e. more than 30% of the total of [[dwelling|household dwellings]] (apartments and houses).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-17570-2_7|title=Neue Wohnungsgemeinnützigkeit|last=Kuhnert|first=Jan|last2=Leps|first2=Olof|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden|isbn=9783658175696|pages=187–212|language=de|doi=10.1007/978-3-658-17570-2_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Owner association ====
A ''(house) owners' association'' (''Vereniging van Eigenaren'', VvE) is by Dutch law established wherever there are separately owned [[apartment|apartments]] in one building. The members are legally owners of their own apartment, but have to cooperate in the association for the maintenance of the building as a whole.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, a ''tenant-owner's association'' is often used as a means to buy new flats. When the cooperative is created, it takes the major part of the loan needed to buy the property. These loans will then be paid off during a fixed periods of years (typically 20-30), and once this is done, the cooperative is dispersed and the flats are transformed into condominiums.

[[File:Jamison Street Warminster Heights.jpg|thumb|left|267px|[[Warminster Heights, Pennsylvania]] was built by the Federal government in the 1940s as housing for civilian workers; it became a housing cooperative in 1986]]

===Scandinavia===
A ''tenant-owner's association'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''bostadsrättsförening'', [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''[[borettslag]]'', [[Danish language|Danish]]: ''andelsboligforening'') is a [[legal term]] used in the [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries]] ([[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], and [[Norway]]) for a type of [[Housing equity partnership|joint ownership]] of property in which the whole property is owned by a co-operative association, which in its turn is owned by its members. Each member holds a share in the association that is proportional to the area of his apartment. Members are required to have a tenant-ownership, which represents the [[apartment]], and in most cases live permanently at the address. There are some legal differences between the countries, mainly concerning the conditions of ownership.

Tenant-owner's associations were established during the 19th century and were originally a [[United Kingdom]]-based concept ([[building society|building societies]]). The market price of existing tenant-ownership shares is often very high, normally much higher than the original stake price.

====Sweden====
In Sweden, 16% of the population lives in apartments in housing cooperatives, while 25% live in rented apartments (more common among young adults and immigrants) and 50% live in private one-family houses (more common among families with children), the remainder living in other forms such as student dormitories or elderly homes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Hushallens-ekonomi/Inkomster-och-inkomstfordelning/Hushallens-boende/Aktuell-pong/378518/Behallare-for-Press/389205/ Halva befolkningen bor i småhus], Statistics Sweden, May 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership in a housing cooperative (''bostadsrättsförening'') is granted to owners of shares in the association, and gives right (''bostadsrätt'') to inhabit the apartment corresponding to the share for an unlimited time.  Shares can be bought and sold on the open [[real estate market]]. This is one of the main forms of home ownership in the country, and a membership in a housing cooperative is generally held to be the same thing as owning (as opposed to renting) an apartment. The most usual physical/legal form is a block of flats owned freehold by a cooperative.

Each housing cooperative has their own bylaws. The members hold annual meetings in the housing cooperative, in which they elect a board of directors that take on the responsibility of managing the cooperation during the upcoming year. In most normal-sized cooperatives the board members are recruited among the inhabitants. The board sets the monthly fee, secures proper administrative procedures, keeps the property in good condition, and may initiate large renovation projects when necessary. The board is also involved when a member sells his share of the co-op to someone else, as the board has to make decisions on allowing the exit of old members and the entry of new members, according to the bylaws (with some exceptions, e.g., the applicant’s nationality, income, or wealth are not valid grounds to refuse entry). The board is also involved when individual members want to initiate large renovation projects, or rent out their apartment to a non-member.

The housing cooperative is a special legal entity, regulated in Swedish law. It has the same obligations of bookkeeping and issuing annual reports as companies and it can take mortgages in the property if needed. In addition, each member may also take mortgages in his ''bostadsrätt'' in order to finance his acquisition of it. The monthly fee paid by the members to the cooperative is intended to cover the operational and financial expenditures of the cooperative. The financial situation of the Swedish cooperatives vary a lot, and on rare occasions cooperatives may go bankrupt. If bankruptcy occurs, the property is sold and the remaining assets are shifted out to the members (who may stay on as tenants or try to form a new cooperative).

In existing properties, tenants may form a housing cooperative together, and then make an offer to the owner to buy the property. When such a cooperative has been formed, it automatically becomes the first prospective buyer should the owner desire to sell. The acquisition is financed by a combination of equity (i.e. the 'stakes' paid by the members) and bank loans.

In properties intended to be owned by housing cooperatives from the start, the construction company (which is either a non-profit association such as HSB, Riksbyggen, or SBC; or a for-profit developer such as PEAB, Veidekke, or Skanska) normally forms a cooperative when the building is erected, and then sells the different apartments (i.e., their shares in the co-op) at fixed prices. When all apartments are sold, the new members take over the responsibility for the property and elect their own board of directors.

=== Switzerland ===
In Switzerland 5.1% of all housing units are in cooperatives. The Schweizerischer Verband für das Wohnungswesen (Swiss cooperative housing federation) represents around 1,500 housing cooperatives with about 160,000 housing units.&lt;ref name="Concerns"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Housing cooperatives in today's Switzerland |journal=Current Concerns |pages=11 |number=11 |date=12 March 2012 |url=http://www.voltairenet.org/IMG/pdf/CC-2012_11.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Housing co-operatives are uncommon in the UK, making up about 0.1% of housing stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cch.coop/docus/coopcomm.html|title=Development of the housing co-operative sector - CCH Confederation of Co-operative Housing|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714131820/http://www.cch.coop/docus/coopcomm.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most are based in urban areas and consist of affordable shared accommodation where the members look after the property themselves. Waiting lists can be very long due to the rarity of housing co-operatives. In some areas the application procedure is integrated into the council housing application system. The laws differ between England and Scotland. The Confederation of Co-operative Housing provides information on housing cooperatives in the United Kingdom and has published a guide on setting them up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New co-op homes|url=http://www.cch.coop/newcoophomes|website=Cch.coop}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Shelter (charity)|Shelter]] website provides information on housing and has information specific to [[England]] and [[Scotland]].

The Catalyst Collective provides information about starting co-operatives in the UK and explains the legal structure of a housing coop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catalystcollective.org|title=Catalyst Collective|website=Catalystcollective.org|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radical Routes]] offers a guide on how to set up a housing co-operative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to set up a housing cooperative |url=http://www.radicalroutes.org.uk/publicdownloads/how-to-housing-co-op.pdf |website=Radicalroutes.org.uk |accessdate=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Student housing cooperatives ====
{{main|Student housing cooperative#United Kingdom}}
Factors of raising cost of living for students and quality of accommodation have led to a drive for Student Housing Co-operatives within the UK inspired by the existing North American Student Housing Cooperatives and their work through [[North American Students of Cooperation]]. [[Edinburgh Student Housing Co-operative]] and [[Birmingham Student Housing Co-operative]] opened in 2014 and [[Sheffield Student Housing Co-operative]] in 2015. All existing Student Housing Co-operatives are members of [[Students for Cooperation]].

===United States===
[[File:Frontal.jpg|thumb|[[Nottingham Cooperative]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], a co-op home since 1971]]
In the [[United States]], housing co-ops are usually categorized as corporations or [[Limited liability company|LLC]]s and are found in abundance from [[Madison Community Cooperative|Madison, Wisconsin]] to the Greater [[New York metropolitan area]]. There are also a number of cooperative and mutual housing projects still in operation across the US that were the result of the purchase of federal defense housing developments by their tenants or groups of returning war veterans and their families. These developments include seven of the eight middle-class housing projects built by the US Government between 1940-42 under the auspices of the [[Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division]] of the [[Federal Works Agency]]. There are many regional housing cooperative associations, such as the Midwest Association of Housing Cooperatives, which is based in [[Michigan]] and serves the Midwest region, covering [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahc.coop/|title=MAHC Main page|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Association of Housing Cooperatives (NAHC) represents all cooperatives within the United States who are members of the organization. This organization is a nonprofit, national federation of housing cooperatives, mutual housing associations, other resident-owned or controlled housing, professionals, organizations, and individuals interested in promoting the interests of cooperative housing communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coophousing.org/|title=National Association of Housing Cooperatives (NAHC)|date=18 March 2014|website=Coophousing.org|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NAHC is the only national cooperative housing organization, and aims to support and educate existing and new cooperative housing communities as the best and most economical form of homeownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coophousing.org|title=National Association of Housing Cooperatives (NAHC)|website=Coophousing.org|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASCO, or [[North American Students of Cooperation]], is an organization founded in 1968 that has helped organized cooperative living for students. With a presence in over 100 towns and cities across North America, NASCO has provided tens of thousands of students with sustainable housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasco.coop/about/|title=North American Student of Cooperation|date=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New York metropolitan area====
[[File:Co-op City Hutch River crop.jpg|thumb|375px|[[Co-op City, Bronx|Co-op City]] in [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]] is the largest cooperative housing development in the world, with 55,000 people.&lt;ref name="Urban Mass: A Look at Co-op City"&gt;Whitsett, Ross.

Cooperatives have a long history in [[New York metropolitan area|Metropolitan New York]] &amp;ndash; in November 1882, ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' describes several cooperative apartment buildings already in existence, with plans to build more&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first=|date=November 1882|title=The Problem of Living in New York|url=http://www.harpers.org/media/pages/1882/11/pdf/HarpersMagazine-1882-11-0034122.pdf|work=[[Harper's Magazine]]|page=918}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; and can be found throughout [[New York City]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], which borders the city to the north, and towns in [[New Jersey]] that are immediately across the Hudson River from [[Manhattan]], such as [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]], [[Edgewater, New Jersey|Edgewater]], or [[Weehawken, New Jersey|Weehawken]].

Apartment buildings and multiple-family housing make up a more significant share of the housing stock in the New York City area than in most other U.S. cities, and the cooperative form of ownership has dominated over the condominium form. Reasons suggested to explain why cooperatives are relatively more common than condominiums in the New York City area are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sazama |first=Gerald |date=January 1996 |title=A Brief History of Affordable Housing Cooperatives in the United States |url=http://www.econ.uconn.edu/working/1996-09.pdf |publisher=[[University of Connecticut]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910100526/http://www.econ.uconn.edu/working/1996-09.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Inspired by [[Abraham Kazan]], cooperatives appeared at least as far back as the 1920s while a legal basis for condominium form of ownership was not available in New York State until 1964.&lt;ref name="QA"&gt;

* The cooperative form can be advantageous as a building mortgage can be carried by the cooperative corporation, leaving less financing to be obtained by each co-op owner. Under condominium ownership only the separate condo owners provide financing. Particularly when interest rates are high, a conversion sponsor may find unit buyers more easily under the cooperative arrangement as buyers will have less financing to arrange on their own; the apparent purchase price of a unit in a cooperative building holding an underlying mortgage is lower than a condo purchase. Cooperative unit buyers may not accurately weigh their share of the building's mortgage.&lt;ref name="QA" /&gt;
* Also, later in a building's life after conversion, major new investments required to repair or replace building systems can be raised by a new central mortgage in a cooperative, while in a condominium funds could only be raised by onerous assessments being required of each individual unit owner. However, New York's condominium law was amended in 1997 to allow [[condominium association]]s to borrow money.&lt;ref&gt;

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a housing advocacy group, which enabled the conversion of over 1,600 foreclosed, city-held rentals into limited-equity, resident-controlled co-ops. 
* A co-op building's board can exercise its own business discretion to impose restrictions on shareholders, and reject prospective purchasers without explanation, as long as the board does not violate federal and state housing or civil rights laws.&lt;ref name="QA" /&gt;

Most of the housing cooperatives in the Greater New York area were converted to that status during the 1980s; generally they were large buildings built between the 1920s and 1950s that a single landlord or corporation owned and rented out that became unprofitable as rental properties. To encourage individual ownership of units, the initial buyers of units (buying from the owner of the entire building) did not have to be approved by a board. Also, the rental tenants living in the building at the time of the conversion were usually given an option to buy at a discount. If the tenants were rent controlled, the law usually protects them by allowing them to stay as renters and the unit may not be occupied by a purchaser until said tenant dies or moves out. Many of these buildings, especially in [[Manhattan]], are actually quite luxurious and exclusive; many celebrities live in them and some famous people are even rejected by co-op boards. In the 1990s and 2000s some rental buildings in the [[Chicago]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[South Florida metropolitan area|Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach]] areas went through a similar conversion process, though not to the degree of New York. 

Many of the cooperatives originally built as co-ops were sponsored by [[trade union]]s, such as the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]]. One of the largest projects was [[Cooperative Village]] in [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]]. The [[United Housing Foundation]] was set up in 1951 and built [[Co-op City, Bronx|Co-op City]] in [[The Bronx]], designed by architect [[Herman Jessor]]. One of the first subsidized, fixed-value cooperatives was [[Morningside Gardens]] in Manhattan's [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]].

Another dynamic also contributed to the large number of cooperatives established in the 1980s and 1990s in New York City – in this case by low- and moderate-income tenant groups. In the 1970s, many New York City private landlords were struggling to maintain their aging properties in the face of high interest rates, redlining, white flight and rising fuel costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Allred |first=Christopher J. |title=Breaking the Cycle of Abandonment |publisher=NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development |date=2000 |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/downloads/pdf/bgc_winner.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2013-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202090632/http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/downloads/pdf/bgc_winner.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arsen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arsen |first=David |date=July 1992 |title=Property Tax Assessment Rates and Residential Abandonment |journal=[[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]]| volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–377| jstor = 3487318| doi =10.1111/j.1536-7150.1992.tb03487.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period also saw some landlord-induced arson to obtain insurance proceeds and widespread non-payment of real estate taxes – over 20% of [[multi-family residential]] properties were in arrears in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Smothers | first = Ronald| date = April 10, 1983| title = City-owned housing units increase| newspaper = [[New York Times]]| pages = | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/10/realestate/city-owned-housing-units-increase.html?&amp;pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tucker | first = William | date = Autumn 1990 | title = The Hidden Costs of Housing Madness | url = http://www.city-journal.org/article01.php?aid=1629 | journal = [[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]] | volume = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-07-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081011004351/http://www.city-journal.org/article01.php?aid=1629 | archivedate = 2008-10-11 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, the city passed Local Law #45, which allowed the city to begin foreclosure proceedings after just one year of non-payment of taxes, not three, resulting in the takeover of thousands of buildings, many of them occupied, by the city of New York through a legal action known as an in rem foreclosure.&lt;ref name="arsen"/&gt; In September 1978, the city's housing agency, the [[New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development]] (HPD), created a series of new housing programs designed to give building residents and community groups control and eventual ownership of in rem buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Wolkoff |first = Michael J.|year = 1999|title = Housing New York: policy challenges and opportunities|publisher = [[State University of New York Press]]|isbn = 978-0-7914-0353-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HPD"&gt;{{cite web| last = Preservation and Development| first = New York City Housing| title = Development| work = Rehabilitation:Tenant Interim Lease Purchase Program| publisher = City of New York| date = | url = http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/html/developers/til.shtml| accessdate = 2009-07-15| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090509094308/http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/html/developers/til.shtml| archivedate = 2009-05-09| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Urban Homesteading Assistance Board]] (UHAB), established in 1974, began to assist residents of these buildings to manage, rehabilitate and acquire their buildings, and form limited-equity housing co-operatives.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; Working with the city's housing agency, its existing loan programs and the power to dispose of abandoned property to non-profit organizations, as well as the state laws governing the establishment of co-operatives, UHAB was able to provide low-income people with the tools – seed money, legal advice, architectural plans, bookkeeping training – to build and run limited-equity housing co-operatives. Through a long-standing contract with the city to provide training and technical assistance to residents of buildings in the Tenant Interim Lease (TIL) Program, UHAB has worked with more than 1,600 coops, preserving over 30,000 units of affordable housing.&lt;ref name="HPD"/&gt;

Some cooperatives in New York City do not own the land upon which their building is situated. These are known as "Land Lease Buildings" and often have significant drawbacks for cooperative owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moulinos.com/legal-update-peter-moulinos-buying-land-lease-cooperative/|title=Buying in a Land Lease Cooperative Building}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How to Lose Your Virginity''''' is an American [[documentary film]] directed by [[Therese Shechter]] and distributed by [[Women Make Movies]]. The film examines how the concept of [[virginity]] shapes the sexual lives of young women and men through the intersecting forces of history, politics, religion and popular culture. It premiered at DOC NYC, a New York City documentary festival, on November 17, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Synopsis ==

''How to Lose Your Virginity'' explores the concept of virginity from historical origins of the word, [[virgin]], to the modern day definitions perpetuated in popular culture. The film takes a critical look at how virginity is ‘restored’ through [[hymenoplasty]], fetishized by [[pornography]], and celebrated at [[purity balls]]. Linking virginity culture to commerce, the film follows [[Moonlite Bunny Ranch|Natalie Dylan]]'s [[virginity auction]] and the sales of [[artificial hymen]] on the internet. Shechter also visits the set of [[Barely Legal (magazine)|''Barely Legal'']] and discusses the success of the "virginity porn" genre. ''How to Lose Your Virginity'' questions the effectiveness of the [[Abstinence-only sex education| Abstinence-only sex education movement]] and observes how [[sexuality]] continues to define a young woman’s morality and self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dove-Viebahn|first=Aviva|title=How to Lose Your Virginity: An Interview with Therese Shechter|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/06/24/how-to-lose-your-virginity-an-interview-with-therese-shechter/|work=June 24, 2010|publisher=Ms. Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stein|first=Sadie|title=Losing Your Virginity Is Harder Than You Think|url=http://jezebel.com/5548592/losing-your-virginity-is-harder-than-you-think|work=May 26, 2010|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The meaning and necessity of virginity as a [[social construct]] is also examined through narration and interviews with notable sexuality experts, such as: former Surgeon General [[Joycelyn Elders|Dr. Joycelyn Elders]], "Scarleteen"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Production ==

The film was directed by [[Therese Shechter]], whose production company Trixie Films is based in Brooklyn. Working with Producer Lisa Esselstein, ''How to Lose Your Virginity'' was shot over several years in the U.S. and Canada. Other films produced by Trixie Films include the documentary feature ''[[I Was A Teenage Feminist]]'' and the documentary shorts "How I Learned to Speak Turkish" and "#slutwalknyc".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Shechter was inspired to make the film because of the growing abstinence until marriage movement and her own experiences as an older virgin. While making the film, Shechter became engaged and incorporated trying on white wedding dresses into the film as a way of looking at how the wedding industry sells virginity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An '''Imperial Crown''' is a crown used for the coronation of [[emperor]]s.

== Design ==

Crowns in Europe during the medieval period varied in design:

{{quote|
An open crown is one which consists basically of a golden circlet elaborately worked and decorated with precious stones or enamels. ... The medieval French crown was of this type. ... the closed crown, which had bands of metal crossing usually from one side to the other and from back to front so that they met in the middle, at the top of the head. ... These arches are in part utilitarian, since they serve to strengthen the crown, in part decorative, since they are normally made to serve as supports for a central cross or jewel, and in part traditional, since a contributing element to the evolution of many medieval crowns was the structure of the early Germanic helmet, which had metal bands crossing at the top of the head to protect the skull from injury.

A special case of a closed crown was that of the Holy Roman Empire. This was originally an open crown, made up of eight separate richly jewelled sections incorporating four magnificent enamelled plaques, but the Emperor Conrad II (1024–39) had added to it a kind of jewelled crest, running from front to back, to which he had thoughtfully attached his name, CHVONRADVS DEI GRATIA ROMANORV(M) IMPERATOR AVG(VSTVS). This jewelled crest was so closely associated with the notion of the imperial office that when the Hapsburgs made a new imperial crown in the 15th century in which they incorporated two large cusps resembling a mitre seen sideways, they provided it with a similar crest running from front to back and topped with a central jewel. ... Strictly speaking, therefore, the only type of crown whose characteristics can properly be regarded as imperial was one with a single crest running from front to back. In practice, in countries unfamiliar with closed crowns at all, any kind of closed crown was assumed to be imperial in character.|Philip Grierson{{sfn|Grierson|1964|pp=127–128}} }}

During the medieval era the crowns worn by English kings had been described as both closed (or arched) and open designs. This was in contrast with kings of France who always wore an open crown. However, there is academic debate on how often closed crowns were used in England during this period, as the first unequivocal use of the closed crown was by Henry IV at his coronation on 13 October 1399.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Given-Wilson, ''Henry IV'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2016), pp. 151-52.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Grierson|1964|p=129}} However his effigy on his tomb in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] wears an open crown so the link in England between the style of the crown and its representation as that worn by a king and an emperor was not established.{{sfn|Grierson|1964|p=129}}  The use of a closed crown may have been adopted by the English as a way of distinguishing the English crown from the French crown,{{sfn|Grierson|1964|pp=129, 133}} but it also had other meanings to some. For example, Henry V wore a helmet-crown of the arched type at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] which the French knight St. Remy commented was "like the imperial crown".{{sfn|Grierson|1964|p=130}}

The association of the closed crown with imperial crowns was already established in Continental Europe by  the late 14th century, for example the florins minted for [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]) sometimes show him with a closed crown (though on the commoner variety, the crown is open). A miniature picture in the ''Chronica Aulae Regiae'' written in the great abbey outside Prague depicts his mother Elizabeth, a queen of Bohemia, wearing an open crown, while his two wives, who had imperial titles, have closed ones.{{sfn|Grierson|1964|p=130 footnote 3}}

During the machinations that surrounded the introduction of the imperial crown under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] (see the section below [[#Legal usage|Legal usage]]), the closed crown, became associated as a symbolic representation of the English Crown as an imperial crown,{{sfn|Grierson|1964|pp=118, 130–131}}{{efn|Henry changed his coinage and his [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] from depicting himself with an open crown to a closed one to depict the imperial nature of the English Crown.{{sfn|Grierson|1964|p=131}} }}{{efn|Shortly before Henry VII of England started his breach with the Roman Catholic Church, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], as regent for his son [[Philip the Handsome]], had the ''real d'or'' coin struck depicting a closed crown, which due to the close trading links between the Low Countries and England would have made the imagery familiar to English men involved in trade and this may have influenced Henry's choice of a difference style of crown.{{sfn|Grierson|1964|p=118, 134}} }} and has remained so until this day.{{sfn|Grierson|1964|p=132}}

==Legal usage==
:{{Main|British Emperor}}
Because Pope [[Clement VII]] would not grant [[Henry VIII of England]] an [[annulment]] of his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]], the English Parliament passed the [[Act in Restraint of Appeals]] (1533) in which it was explicitly stated that
:Where by divers sundry old authentic histories and chronicles it is manifestly declared and expressed that this realm of England is an empire, and so hath been accepted in the world, governed by one supreme head and king, having the dignity and royal estate of the imperial crown of the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/123week9.htm The opening words of the Act in restraint of Appeals, 1533]&lt;/ref&gt;
The next year the [[Acts of Supremacy#First Act of Supremacy 1534|Act of Supremacy]] (1534) explicitly tied the headship of the church to the imperial crown:
:The only supreme head in earth of the [[Church of England]] called Anglicana Ecclesia, and shall have and enjoy annexed and united to the imperial crown of this realm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/123week9.htm Excerpt from The Act of Supremacy (1534)]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] the First Act of Supremacy was annulled, but during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] the [[Second Act of Supremacy]], with similar wording to the First Act, was passed in 1559. During the [[English Interregnum]] the laws were annulled, but the acts which caused the laws to be in abeyance were themselves, deemed to be null and void by the Parliaments of the [[English Restoration]], so by act of Parliament ''The Crown'' of England and (later the British and UK crowns) are imperial crowns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9553">'''Information Kerala Mission''' [http://www.infokerala.org] (IKM),Is an Autonomous Institution under Local self government Department, Government of Kerala, for computerisation and networking of local governments in [[Kerala]] (India) and has been in existence for a decade since August 1999. The purpose of the Institution was to "facilitate easy and prompt communication between State Planning Board (SPB) and 1215 local 'bodies' for swift monitoring".&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India for the year ended 31 March 2004. P39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic objective==

The basic objective of IKM is to provide vibrant Information technology [[e-governance]] to  the local governments in Kerala.IKM attempts to strengthen local self-governance or third tier governance and development through ICT ([[Information and Communications Technology]]) applications. It envisages computerising and networking the 1223 '''local self-government institutions''' (LSGIs) in [[Kerala]]. It is the largest and most comprehensive [[local government]] computerisation project in [[India]]. It addresses the entire gamut of issues concerning local governance, decentralised planning, and local economic development.

Executive Director Of IKM- Seeram Sambasiva Rao IAS

==Phased implementation==

IKM envisages a phased transformation of the existing systems to electronic systems. It has developed methodologies that suit this purpose. IKM has adopted a human-centred approach to e-governance. This approach is characterised by the holistic and proactive evaluation of existing systems and legacy systems, attempts to simplify and transform existing systems and effecting integration of systems. Systematic attempts at process reforms are also part of it. These would enable faster and objective decision-making, more citizen-friendly interfaces and better accountability.

IKM Methodology places the employees and functionaries at the central stage of this transformation and focuses on their empowerment and capacity building as the mechanism for improving performance. The software applications are developed through active user participation. Emphasis is placed on demystification of technologies and establishing adequate technical support systems. Training and hand holding are given high priority. IKM has taken out extensive pilot deployment of its application suites.

==Website for all local governments==

The [[Government of India]] envisaged a plan for creating a portal for rural local governments in the entire country including the State of Kerala, for which webserver was set up and templates for uploading of each website by the respective local government was envisaged. But it remains in cold storage now.

Now the [[Government of Kerala]], as part of the activities of IT Mission focusing on FOSS promotion,started working on a project for creating a website of each local government in Kerala. A few [http://azhikode.entegramam.gov.in/ websites in Malayalam] were created by using the [[Content Management System]] [http://www.joomla.org/ Joomla], as part of it.

==Audit charges against IKM==

[[File:Fachongle Isaf - geograph.org.uk - 334733.jpg|thumb|[[Farm]] ''Fachongle Isaf'', where John Seymour lived during the 1970s]]
'''John Seymour''' (12 June 1914 &amp;ndash; 14 September 2004) was a prolific early author in the [[self-sufficiency]] movement. He had multiple roles as a writer, broadcaster, [[environmentalist]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]], [[Smallholding|smallholder]] and activist;   a rebel against: [[consumerism]], [[industrialisation]], [[genetically modified organisms]], cities, motor cars;   an advocate for: [[Individualism|self-reliance]], personal responsibility, self-sufficiency, conviviality (food, drink, dancing and singing), gardening, caring for the Earth and for the soil.

==Early life==
Seymour was born in [[Hampstead]], [[London]], [[England]];&lt;ref name=Girardet&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.guardian.co.uk/ethicalmoney/story/0,1356,1309292,00.html | title=Obituary: John Seymour, The Guardian, September 21, 2004 | accessdate=2 June 2007 | location=London | date=21 September 2004 | first=Herbert | last=Girardet}}&lt;/ref&gt; his father died when he was very young,{{fact|date=February 2017}} his mother remarried and the family moved to the  fashionable seaside town of [[Frinton-on-Sea]] in north-east [[Essex]].&lt;ref name=Girardet/&gt; It was however surrounded by agricultural land, and the life led by those on the land and in small boats   laid a foundation for his later vision of a simple cottage economy with farming and fishing providing the essentials of life.

After schooling in England and Switzerland,{{fact|date=February 2017}} he studied agriculture at [[Wye College]],&lt;ref name=Girardet/&gt; at that time a school of the University of London. {{fact|date=February 2017}}In 1934, at the age of 20, he went to [[Southern Africa]] where he held a succession of jobs:   a farmhand and then manager of a sheep farm, a deckhand and skipper of a fishing boat operating from [[Namibia]] (then [[South-West Africa]]), a copper mine worker in [[Zambia]] (then [[Northern Rhodesia]]), and a worker for the government veterinary service. Whilst in Africa he spent some time with [[bushmen]] where he gained friendship and an insight into the life of [[hunter gatherer]]s.

==1939 to 1951==
At the start of [[World War II]] in 1939,   Seymour travelled to [[Kenya]] where he enlisted in the [[Kenya Regiment]],{{fact|date=February 2017}} and was posted to the [[King's African Rifles]].&lt;ref name=Girardet/&gt; He fought against Italian troops in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|Abyssinian Campaign]] in [[Ethiopia]]. The regiment was then posted to [[Sri Lanka]] (then the British colony   Ceylon) and afterwards to [[Burma]], where allied forces were fighting against [[Japan]]. For Seymour the war ended on a low note; he expressed his disgust when the Allies used fission bombs on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].

On arrival in Britain after the war Seymour worked for a while on a [[Thames sailing barge]], a traditional craft   still operating around the south and east coasts of [[England]], where he picked up the folk songs of a disappearing occupation. After working as a labour officer for the Agricultural Committee finding agricultural work for German prisoners of war who still not returned home in 1950,  he created a series of short programmes on the   [[BBC Home Service]] (now [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]). He then travelled overland to [[India]] for the BBC, gaining experience of the [[Subsistence agriculture]] still common in eastern Europe and Asia. His experiences on the journey led to his first book, ''The Hard Way to India'', published in 1951.

==The Smallholdings==
Seymour was living aboard a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] sailing [[smack (ship)|smack]] when he married Sally Medworth, an [[Australia]]n [[pottery|potter]] and artist in 1954. In this they travelled around the waterways and rivers of [[England]] and the [[Netherlands]], journeys later described in ''Sailing through England''. As their first daughter grew older they felt that a land-base would be more suitable. They leased two isolated [[cottage]]s on {{convert|5|acre|ha|lk=on}} of land near [[Orford, Suffolk|Orford]] in [[Suffolk]]. These 5 acres are still called Seymour's Bit by the current owner. The manner in which they developed [[self-sufficiency]] on this [[smallholding]] is recounted in ''The Fat of the Land'' (1961). At the end of the 1960s,  Seymour, along  with other radical voices like [[Herbert Read]], [[Edward Goldsmith]] and [[E. F. Schumacher|Fritz Schumacher]], provided a stream of articles for the journal ''[[Resurgence &amp; Ecologist|Resurgence]]'' edited from 1966–1970 by [[John Papworth]].

In 1964 the family moved to a farm near [[Newport, Pembrokeshire]]. The 1970s saw Seymour's publication rate reach a maximum. In 1976 ''The Complete Book of Self-Sufficiency'' was published, a guide for real and dreaming [[Downshifting (lifestyle)|downshifter]]s. Appearing  shortly after the publication of  Schumacher's ''[[Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered]]'' (1973) and  ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life's]]'' first showing on British television (1975), the sales of the book exceeded all expectations. It was also set to establish the reputation of two young publishers, [[Christopher Dorling]] and [[Peter Kindersley]] who had commissioned and edited the work. In addition to self-sufficiency he wrote four guide books in the ''Companion Guide'' series.

In the 1970s and 1980s he   also made television programmes: an early series followed the footsteps of [[George Borrow]]'s ''Wild Wales'' (1862), later he spent three years making the BBC series ''Far From Paradise'' (with [[Herbert Girardet]]) which examined the history of [[human impact on the environment]].

His farm in Wales welcomed visitors seeking guidance on the smallholders life, a project which continued when he moved to [[County Wexford]] in Ireland during the 1980s. Here in 1999 he was taken to court for damaging a crop of GM sugar beet. For the last years of his life, he lived on   his old Pembrokeshire farm with his daughter's family. He died there on 14 September 2004 and was buried in the top field in an orchard that he had planted.

==Legacy==
His obituary in the Guardian said: 
:''John was as much at home in the humblest house on a hillside, as in the manor house of landed gentry. He was like a force of nature, always willing to listen, always interested in learning about new - or very old - ways of working the land. He was a one-man rebellion against modernism ...'' Herbert Girardet, 2005.&lt;ref name=Girardet/&gt;

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender''' ([[LGBT]]) people in [[Sergipe]], Brazil enjoy many of the same legal protections available to non-LGBT people. Homosexuality is legal in the state.

==Laws against discrimination==
Sergipe was among the first states in Brazil to enact a state constitution banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, doing so in 1989 alongside [[Mato Grosso do Sul]].

==Same-sex marriage==
On 5 July 2012, Brazilian State's Judiciary Power of [[Sergipe]] issued "Provimento nº 06/2012" regulating same-sex marriage throughout the State. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tjse.jus.br/corregedoria/documentos/publicacoes/provimentos/2012/provimento-062012.pdf|title=Marriage open to gay couples in Sergipe|language=Portuguese|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latvian Human Rights Committee''' ({{lang-lv|Latvijas Cilvēktiesību komiteja}}, {{lang-ru|Латвийский комитет по правам человека}}) is a human rights non-governmental organization in [[Latvia]]. It is member of international human rights and anti-racism NGOs [[FIDH]], AEDH&lt;!-- and [[European Network Against Racism|ENAR]] --&gt;. Co-chairpersons of LHRC are Vladimirs Buzajevs and Natalija Jolkina. According to the authors of the study "Ethnopolitics in Latvia", former CBSS Commissioner on Democratic Institutions and Human Rights [[Ole Espersen]] "had visited LHRC various times and had used mostly the data of that organisation in his views on Latvia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://providus.lv/article_files/1119/original/Etnopolitika_Latvija.pdf?1326909280 Etnopolitika Latvijā.

==History==
In 1992, LHRC was founded (then — as Latvian Human Rights and International Humanitarian Co-operation Committee) by a group of people co-operating since 1990, led by [[Tatjana Ždanoka]] and Vladimirs Bogdanovs. In 1995, LHRC has joined FIDH and was registered by Latvian authorities.

Since 1994, LHRC periodically publishes an updated list of differences in rights between citizens and [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizens]] of Latvia. Since 1997, LHRC supports [[UNITED for Intercultural Action]]. In 2007, LHRC has joined ENAR and AEDH.

This is a list of [[Prime Minister]]s defeated by either a parliamentary [[motion of no confidence]] or by the similar process of [[loss of supply]].

==Prime Ministers defeated by votes of no confidence==
===[[Australia]]===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
No Australian prime minister has ever been defeated in the House of Representatives by an explicit motion of no confidence,&lt;ref&gt;Anne Twomey (2010, Sept 10), [http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/joining-the-coalition-to-pass-policies-will-backfire-20100909-1532w.html Joining the Coalition to pass policies will backfire], ''Sydney Morning Herald''&lt;/ref&gt; although one was passed by the Representatives.&lt;ref name="NAA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naa.gov.au/collection/snapshots/dismissal/index.aspx |title=The motion that might have saved the Whitlam governmen |publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] |access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, six prime ministers were unable to enact important policy and therefore resigned, two prime ministers were unable to obtain supply from the House of Representatives, one prime minister was unable to obtain supply in the Senate and was dismissed by the Governor General, and one prime minister never had the confidence of the House of Representatives (but an election was announced when he was appointed, so his defeat was without effect).

These prime ministers were able to gain supply from the House of Representatives, but were unable to pass important policy-related legislation:

*[[Chris Watson]] (1904, [[Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904|''Conciliation and Arbitration Bill'']])
*[[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]] (1905, amendment on the address-in-reply)
*[[Alfred Deakin]] (1908, motion to change the time of the next meeting of parliament)
*[[Andrew Fisher]] (1909, a motion to adjourn debate)
*[[Stanley Bruce]] (1929, major bill defeated)
*[[James Scullin]] (1931, a motion to adjourn debate)
*[[Malcolm Fraser]] (1975, a motion by the Governor-General to reappoint [[Gough Whitlam]] as Prime Minister)

These prime ministers could not gain supply from the House of Representatives or an opposition amendment to a supply bill was passed:

*[[Alfred Deakin]] (1904, could pass no legislation)
*[[Arthur Fadden]] (1941, budget was amended down by [[Australian pound|£A]]1)

[[Gough Whitlam]] could not gain supply from the Senate which was controlled by the [[Coalition (Australia)|conservative Coalition]]. It thus precipitated the [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975|1975 constitutional crisis]] and Whitlam was dismissed.

Following Whitlam's dismissal, [[Malcolm Fraser]] was appointed Prime Minister. He never had control of the House of Representatives, which immediately passed a motion of no confidence. However, the Governor-General had already accepted the advice of Fraser to dissolve parliament by the time of the motion of no confidence, and had already acted on it before he could receive the motion, so it was without effect.{{r|NAA}}

===[[Bulgaria]]===
*[[Philip Dimitrov]] (1992) - lost a vote of confidence

===[[Canada]]===
All no confidences are [[minority government]]s.

*[[Arthur Meighen]] (1926) - loss of confidence supply
*[[John Diefenbaker]] (1963) - loss of confidence supply as a result of cabinet revolt
*[[Pierre Trudeau]] (1974) - loss of confidence supply&lt;ref&gt;Trudeau lost a motion of confidence when he failed to pass the 1974 budget. However, it was later revealed that this was done purposely by Prime Minister Trudeau in a successful attempt to win a majority government. This is the only time the tactic has been used in federal Canadian politics, but it established a precedent. Such a tactic is now called "engineering the defeat of one's own government", and the practice is widely frowned upon.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Joe Clark]] (1979) - loss of confidence supply
*[[Paul Martin]] (2005) - opposition triggered motion&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;While Meighen, Diefenbaker and Trudeau were toppled by [[loss of supply]], and Joe Clark was defeated by the passage of a subamendment to a budget bill that read "that this House has lost confidence in the government," Martin and Harper lost an actual motion of no confidence put forward by the opposition parties.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Stephen Harper]] (2011) - opposition triggered motion as a result of [[contempt of Parliament]] finding&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/03/25/pol-defeat.html|title=Election looms as government falls|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=25 March 2011|accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Man's Rights in the Family Party''' ({{lang-he|מפלגת זכויות הגבר במשפחה - רע"ש}}, ''Miflega Zkhuyot HaGever BeMishpaha - Ra'ash'') was a minor political party in [[Israel]] headed by [[Yaakov Schlusser]].

==Background==
In 1996, Schlusser published a book, ''Men's Rights in the Family?'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=זכויות הגבר במשפחה?|last=שלוסר|first=יעקב|publisher=שלוסר|year=1996|isbn=9657018056|location=תל אביב|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which argued that family law in the State of Israel is biased against men. Issues such as divorce, alimony, false accusations of abuse, and child support are addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612043253/http://dhost.info/raash/book.html|title=Men's Rights in the Family? - book in PDF format|last=|first=|date=2012-06-12|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schlusser subsequently contested the [[Israeli general election, 1996|1996 Knesset elections]] as the head of the Man's Rights in the Family Party. The platform of the party called for the abolition of the clause granting automatic custody to the mother in cases of divorce for small children. It also called for basing child support on other factors besides the cost-of-living index. Other issues the party dealt with was more housing for young couples, lowering taxes and a call for state pensions. It also called for the option of a secular civil marriage in addition to a religiously recognized marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612043239/http://dhost.info/raash/layout.html|title=Archived website of Ra'ash party|last=|first=|date=2012-06-12|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received 2,388 votes (0.1%), failing to win a seat.

In the [[Israeli legislative election, 1999|1999 Knesset elections]] the party ran under the name "Justice for All" and received 1,257 votes (0.04%), the second lowest number of votes with a 1.5% [[Election threshold|electoral threshold]]. 

In 2003 the party was accused by the Israel Women’s Lobby of inciting violence against women and misrepresenting facts in their campaign broadcasts. However according to an article in ''Haaretz'', the chairman of the Central Elections Committee rejected the women's lobby petition to censor the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/elections/cheshin-rejects-petition-to-censor-man-s-rights-in-the-family-ad-1.22163 |title= Cheshin rejects petition to censor Man's Rights in the Family ad |author= Alon, Gideon |date= January 15, 2003 |work= [[Haaretz]] |publisher= |accessdate=November 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent [[Israeli legislative election, 2003|Knesset elections]], the party received 1,284 votes (0.04%). The [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|2006 elections]] saw the party run as "Justice for All" again, this time receiving 3,819 votes (0.12%).

Prior to the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 Knesset elections]] Schlusser said in an interview with Yedioth Achronoth that one out of every two fathers loses the right to see their children as a result of messy divorces adding, "children have a right to see their fathers,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3637253,00.html |title= Men's Rights Party vies for votes |author= Edelson, Daniel |date= December 11, 2008 |work= [[Ynetnews]] |publisher= |accessdate= November 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=132546 |title= Smaller parties reckon with the political wilderness |author= Socol, Max |date= March 11, 2009 |work= [[The Jerusalem Post]] |publisher= |accessdate= November 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; also claiming that "a child that sees a woman in control, in contradiction to nature, may turn homosexual". In the elections the party received only 921	votes (0.03%).

In 2012 Schusser was profiled in ''Makor Rishon'' about his personal experiences which led him to run for public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.makorrishon.co.il/nrg/online/54/ART2/414/823.html|title=יו''ר מפלגת זכויות הגבר: ''אני שווה לפחות 10 מנדטים''|website=NRG מעריב|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 he advocated changing laws that stipulate stay-at-home men must pay National Insurance while housewives are exempt. In an interview with ''Haaretz'', he stated, "When it comes to the age of retirement, for example, women can retire at age 62, but I can't."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/mr-moms-suffer-from-insurance-law-1.5279298|title=Vive La Difference: Stay-at-home Men Liable for NII Payments|last=Weissberg|first=Hila|date=2013-10-25|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1321">The [http://www.mpf.org.uk '''Methodist Peace Fellowship'''] is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Methodist]] [[Christian pacifism|Christian pacifist]] organization.

The Methodist Peace Fellowship (MPF) was founded by Rev. Henry Carter in 1933 to inform and unite Methodists who covenanted together "to renounce war and all its works and ways."'  It is part of the international [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]].  Members are expected to accept a fully pacifist position, but the MPF now encourages others to enrol as 'supporters'.

The MPF arranges a public meeting each year in connection with the British [[Methodist Conference]], and in other ways seeks to witness at national level through Methodist channels. The MPF has little local organisation with members usually working through the Fellowship of Reconicilation or local peace organisations.

At one time the Methodist Peace Fellowship claimed a quarter of all Methodist ministers among its members.

{{Governance}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}
'''Network governance''' is "interfirm coordination that is characterized by organic or informal [[social system]], in contrast to [[bureaucratic]] structures within firms and formal contractual relationships between them.&lt;ref name="Jones et al 1997"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = Candace | last2 = Hesterly | first2 = William S. | last3 = Borgatti | first3 = Stephen P. | title = A general theory of network governance: exchange conditions and social mechanisms | journal = [[Academy of Management Review]] | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 911–945 | doi = 10.5465/AMR.1997.9711022109 | jstor = 259249 | date = October 1997 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of [[privatization]], [[public private partnership]], and [[contracting]] are defined in this context." Network governance constitutes a "distinct form of coordinating economic activity" (Powell, 1990:301) which contrasts and competes with markets and hierarchies.&lt;ref name="Dedeurwaerdere, 2007" /&gt;

== Definition ==

Network governance involves a select, persistent, and structured set of autonomous firms (as well as nonprofit agencies) engaged in creating products or services based on implicit and open-ended contracts adapt to environmental contingencies and to coordinate and safeguard ex-changes. These contracts are socially—not legally—binding. As such, governance networks distinguish themselves from the [[hierarchical control system|hierarchical control]] of the state and the competitive regulation of the market in at least three ways:&lt;ref name="Sorensen and Torfing, 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sørensen | first1 = Eva | last2 = Torfing | first2 = Jacob | title = The democratic anchorage of governance networks | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–218 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2005.00129.x | date = September 2005 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#In terms of the relationship between the actors, governance networks can be described as a  [[wikt:pluricentric|pluricentric]] system as opposed to the [[wikt:unicentric|unicentric]] system&lt;ref name="Kersbergen &amp; Waarden 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Kersbergen | first1 = Kees | last2 = Van Waarden | first2 = Frans | title = 'Governance' as a bridge between disciplines: cross-disciplinary inspiration regarding shifts in governance and problems of governability, accountability and legitimacy | journal = [[European Journal of Political Research]] | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–171 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6765.2004.00149.x | date = March 2004 | ref = harv | hdl = 1871/33908 }}&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;151). Governance networks involve a large number of interdependent actors who interact with each other in order to produce an outcome.&lt;ref name="Sorensen and Torfing, 2005" /&gt;
#In terms of decision making, governance networks are based on negotiation rationality as opposed to the substantial rationality that governs state rule and the procedural rationality that governs market competition&lt;ref name="Scharpf, 1997"&gt;{{citation | last = Scharpf | first = Fritz | contribution = Actor-centered institutionalism | editor-last = Scharpf | editor-first = Fritz | title = Games real actors play actor-centered institutionalism in policy research | publisher = Westview Press | location = Boulder, Colorado | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780813399683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;46)
#Compliance is ensured through trust and political obligation which, over time, becomes sustained by self-constituted rules and norms.&lt;ref name="Nielsen and Pedersen 1988"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nielsen | first1 = Klaus | last2 = Pedersen | first2 = Ove K. | title = The negotiated economy: ideal and history | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 79–101 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00361.x | date = June 1998 | ref = harv }} [https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/scandinavian_political_studies/article/view/12990/24777 Text.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a concept, Network Governance explains increased efficiency and reduced agency problems for organizations existing in highly turbulent environments. On the one hand, the efficiency is enhanced through distributed [[knowledge acquisition]] and decentralised problem solving; on the other, the effectiveness is improved through the emergence of collective solutions to global problems in different self-regulated sectors of activity.&lt;ref name="Dedeurwaerdere, 2007"/&gt; Due to the rapid pace of modern society and competitive pressures from [[globalization]], transnational network governance has gained prominence.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Diane. Knowledge actors and transnational governance: The private-public policy nexus in the global agora. Palgrave Macmillan, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Network governance first depends on the comprehension of the short and long term global business risks. It’s based on the definition of the [[Information technology|IT]] key objectives and their influence on the network.  It includes the negotiation of the satisfaction criteria for the business lines and integrates processes for the measurement and improvement of the global efficiency and end user satisfaction. Beyond that, it allows the constitution and piloting of internal teams and external partners as well as the setting up of a control system enabling to validate the performance of the whole. Finally, it ensures permanent communication at all the various management levels.

In the [[public sector]], network governance is not universally accepted as a positive development by all public administration scholars. Some doubt its ability to adequately perform as a [[democracy|democratic governance structure]] while others view it as phenomenon that promotes efficient and effective delivery of public goods and services. Examining managed networks in health care, Ferlie and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ferlie | first1 = Ewan | last2 = Fitzgerald | first2 = Louise | last3 = McGivern | first3 = Gerry | last4 = Dopson | first4 = Sue | last5 = Bennett | first5 = Chris | title = Making wicked problems governable? The case of managed networks in health care | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 2013 | isbn = 9781299441927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ferlie | first1 = Ewan | last2 = Fitzgerald | first2 = Louise | last3 = McGivern | first3 = Gerry | last4 = Dopson | first4 = Sue | last5 = Bennett | first5 = Chris | title = Public policy networks and 'wicked problems': a nascent solution? | journal = [[Public Administration (journal)|Public Administration]] | volume = 89 | issue = 2 | pages = 307–324 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9299.2010.01896.x | date = June 2011 | ref = harv }} [http://www.download.bham.ac.uk/hsmc/ewan-ferlie.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that networks may be the 'least bad' form of governance addressing [[wicked problem]]s, such as providing health care for the increasing number of older people.

{{Expand section|date=July 2017}}
Provan and Kenis categorize network governance forms along two different dimensions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Provan|first1=Keith G.|last2=Kenis|first2=Patrick|title=Modes of Network Governance: Structure, Management, and Effectiveness|journal=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory|date=1 April 2008|volume=18|issue=2|pages=229–252|doi=10.1093/jopart/mum015|url=http://faculty.cbpp.uaa.alaska.edu/afgjp/PADM601%20Fall%202011/Modes%20of%20Network%20Governance.%202008.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2017|issn=1053-1858}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Network governance may or may not be brokered. They refer to a network whose organizations interact with every other organization to decentralizedly govern the network "shared governance". At the other extreme a network may be highly brokered via centralized network brokers with only few and limited direct organization-to-organization interactions.
* Network may be participant governed or externally governed.

===Participant-governed networks===
{{See also|Participation (decision making)|Self-governance|Group decision-making}}
In participant governance a network is governed by its members themselves.

They call such networks that involve most or all network members interacting on a relatively equal basis in the process of governance "shared participant governance".

===Lead organization–governed networks===
More centralized networks may be governed by and through a lead organization that is a network member.

== Historical and modern examples of network governance ==
* In the 10th -13th Centuries, merchants in Cairo begin forming a network of merchants that report to each other the intents and information on agents working for them, and collectively inflict sanctions on agents that perform poorly. This leads to a hub of trading formed in Cairo and Aden – this makes the information on the market conditions, and the reputation of various agents easier to access for the good of the whole.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayBackIssues?jid=BHR|title=Business History Review|website=journals.cambridge.org|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* By the 12th Century, Venice provides its merchants with an improved flow of information regarding the market conditions they face, as well as information on the practices of individual agents. This recording of information helps merchants make more informed business decisions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The formation of the English and Dutch East India Companies forms a cooperation between merchants and companies to better regulate and inform others on the reputations of trading actors in London, Amsterdam and ports in East Africa and Arabia. This is a collective movement by governments and companies to raise capital for both the country and businesses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
These examples show how Network Governance worked in the eras of increased trade and cooperation between merchants and nations ranging from the 10th Century to the 17th Century. Ron Harris, in his journal "Reputation at the Birth of [[Corporate governance|Corporate Governance]]. "The questions of who had a good reputation and who had a bad one, whom one could trust and entrust money to, were unaltered, but the relationships to which they applied changed, as did the institutions that provided answers to these questions."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[AMBER Alert|Amber Alert]] - In 1996 the "Amber Alert" system was established after nine year old Amber Hagerman was kidnapped and murdered in Arlington, TX. Media networks, in collaboration with law enforcement, joined a grassroots movement to spread the cause in establishing a network to aide in broadcasting alerts in an effort to prevent future crimes. This movement has grown to include all fifty states, and spread alerts across state lines. The Amber Alert system has since been widely accepted as the first-response program for missing-persons nationwide.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manna|first=Paul|date=June 2010|title=Network Governance in Three Policy Areas with Implications for the Common Core State Standards Initiative|url=|journal=Thomas B. Fordham Institute|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Homeland Security Fusion Centers – After the September 11th attacks, the United States endeavoured to improve the coordination between national and local organizations concerned with security. The [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] and a [[Director of National Intelligence]] were implemented at the federal level in response to this problem. Soon after, states began creating their own networks to share information pertinent to homeland security. As a result, fusion centers have popped up in almost every state, as well as many regions. These fusion centers provide a hub for law enforcement agencies to collaborate on national security measures in an effort to promote transparency across agencies, whether it be at the state, local or federal level.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
These are just two examples that help better explain network governance. A sharing of knowledge and information is at the center of the Amber Alert movement and the rise of Homeland Security Fusion Centers.

== Importance of governmental relations==
Relationships among governing positions and governing institutions are absolutely vital for the success of the internal workings of the governments that aid the public. While federal, state, and local governments differ in their policies, they all work in coherence in order for the foundations to work efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=259249}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Checks and balances" is a prime synonym when referring to intergovernmental relations. All participating parties of the government must adhere to specific guidelines in order to cultivate a fair and even playing field that is both beneficial, and just to the population it affects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
A primary principal in governmental relationships is the balance of power between the parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forrer|title=Governing cross-sector collaboration|publisher=San Francisco, CA : Jossey-Bass, [2014]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal government has a large amount of control, in terms of national security, national finances and foreign affairs. However, in order to balance that control, state level governments have a significant voice in intrastate politics.&lt;ref name="Newig et al, 2010" /&gt; Specific examples of state level policies include topics such as state highways, borderlines, and state parks. This allows states to still have flexibility while bonding to national policy.

Unfortunately, creating relationships among different level governments and government agencies are a complicated, and often grueling process.&lt;ref name="Haas 1992" /&gt; However, many agencies make deals or come to terms or make a compromise within the party in order to further benefit both institutions. For example, a state may fund a county in order to better the county roads because it could be a direct reflection of the state. Intra-governmental relations between agencies, state level, local level, and federal level government must work together in order to prosper and create policies or laws that are beneficial to both the agencies and the public.&lt;ref name="Warning,2006" /&gt;

== Role in environmental governance ==
&lt;ref name="Newig et al, 2010" /&gt; 
In the wake of apparent failures to govern complex environmental problems by the central [[Sovereign state|state]], "new" modes of [[governance]] have been proposed in recent years.&lt;ref name="Newig et al, 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Newig | first1 = Jens | last2 = Günther | first2 = Dirk | last3 = Pahl-Wostl | first3 = Claudia | title = Synapses in the network: learning in governance networks in the context of environmental management | journal = [[Ecology and Society]] | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | id = article 24 | date = 2010 | url = http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol15/iss4/art24/ | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Network governance is the mode most commonly associated with the concept of governance, in which autonomous [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] work together to achieve common goals.

The emergence of network governance can be characterised by an attempt to take into account the increasing importance of [[NGOs]], the [[private sector]], scientific networks and [[international organisation|international institutions]] in the performance of various functions of governance.&lt;ref name="Dedeurwaerdere, 2005"&gt;Dedeurwaerdere, T. 2005. [http://www.iddri.org/Activites/Seminaires-reguliers/s13_dedeurwaerdere.pdf The contribution of network governance to sustainable development].&lt;/ref&gt; Embedding interventions to make society better and to transform conflicts within "relational webs"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The moral imagination : the art and soul of building peace|last=Paul.|first=Lederach, John|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199747580|oclc=653082476}}&lt;/ref&gt; can ensure better coordination with existing initiatives and institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fmreview.org/fragilestates/balyk-pugh.html|title=Networked governance in Ecuador's border regions {{!}} Forced Migration Review|website=www.fmreview.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and greater local acceptance and buy in, which makes the intervention more sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Jeffrey D.|date=2016-09-01|title=Peacebuilding Among Transnational Youth in Migrant-Receiving Border Regions of Ecuador|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|volume=11|issue=3|pages=83–97|doi=10.1080/15423166.2016.1222591|issn=1542-3166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent examples of such networks that have been instrumental in forming successful working arrangements are the [[World Commission on Dams]], the [[Global Environmental Facility]] and the [[flexible mechanisms|flexible mechanism]] of the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref name="Streck, 2002"&gt;{{citation | last = Streck | first = Charlotte | contribution = Global public policy networks as coalitions for change | editor-last1 = Esty | editor-first1 = Daniel C. | editor-last2 = Ivanova | editor-first2 = Maria H. | title = Global environmental governance: options &amp; opportunities | pages = 121–140 | publisher = Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies | location = New Haven, Connecticut | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780970788221 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ongoing effort is the [[United Nations Global Compact]] which combines multiple stakeholders in a trilateral construction including representatives from governments, private sector and the NGO community.&lt;ref name="Haas, 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Haas | first = Peter M. | title = Addressing the global governance deficit | journal = [[Global Environmental Politics]] | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 1–15 | doi = 10.1162/glep.2004.4.4.1 | date = November 2004 | ref = harv | hdl = 1811/31977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;6)

One main reason for the proliferation of network approaches in [[environmental governance]] is their potential to integrate and make available different sources of knowledge and competences and to encourage individual and collective learning.&lt;ref name="Dedeurwaerdere, 2007"&gt;{{citation | last = Dedeurwaerdere | first = Tom | contribution = The contribution of network governance to sustainability impact assessment | editor-last1 = Thoyer | editor-first1 = Sophie | editor-last2 = Martimort-Asso | editor-first2 = Benoît | title = Participation for sustainability in trade | pages = 209–228 | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot, England Burlington, Vermont | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780754683445 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haas, 2004"/&gt; Currently, environmental governance faces various challenges that are characterised by complexities and uncertainties inherent to environmental and sustainable problems.&lt;ref name="Newig et al 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Newig | first1 = Jens | last2 = Voß | first2 = Jan-Peter | last3 = Monstadt | first3 = Jochen  | title = Governance for sustainable development: coping with ambivalence, uncertainty and distributed power | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780415451925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Network governance can provide a means to address these governance problems by institutionalising learning on facts and deliberation on value judgements.&lt;ref name="Head, 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Palm | first = Brian W. | title = Assessing network-based collaborations: effectiveness for whom? | journal = Public Management Review, Special Issue: Collaborative Networks: New Performance Challenges | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 733–749 | doi = 10.1080/14719030802423087 | date = November 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the realm of global chemical safety, transnational networks have formed around initiatives by international organisations and successfully developed rules for addressing global chemical issues many of which have been implemented by national legislations. Most notably, these transnational networks made it possible to avoid the institutional apathy that is typically found in political settings with many actors of conflicting interests, especially on a global level.&lt;ref name="Warning,2006"&gt;{{citation | last = Warning | first = Michael | contribution = Transnational bureaucracy networks: a resource of global environmental governance? | editor-last = Winter | editor-first = Gerd | title = Multilevel governance of global environmental change: perspectives from science, sociology and the law | pages = 305–329 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780521173438 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [e-book] URL: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511720888.013 Details.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through integration of actors from different sectors, governance networks are able to provide an innovative environment of learning, laying the way for adaptive and effective governance.&lt;ref name="Dedeurwaerdere, 2007"/&gt;  One particular form of networks important to governance problems is ‘[[epistemic community|epistemic communities]]’ in which actors share the same basic casual beliefs and normative values.&lt;ref name="Haas 1992"&gt;{{citation | last = Haas | first = Peter M. | contribution = Introduction: epistemic communities and international policy coordination | editor-last = Haas | editor-first = Peter M. | title = Knowledge, power, and international policy coordination | pages = 1–35 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | location = Columbia, South Carolina | year = 1997 | isbn = 9781570031755 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;3) Although participation in these epistemic communities requires an interest in the problem at stake, the actors involved do not necessarily share the same interest. In general, the interests are interdependent but can also be different or sometimes contesting, stressing the need for consensus building and the development of cognitive commodities.&lt;ref name="Newig et al, 2010"/&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;26)

The main argument in the literature for the advantage of network governance over traditional [[command and control regulation]] or, alternatively, recourse to market regulation, is its capacity to deal with situations of intrinsic uncertainty and decision making under [[bounded rationality]].&lt;ref name="Haas, 2004"/&gt; This is typically the case in the field of global environmental governance where one has to deal with complex and interrelated problems. In these situations, network institutions can create a synergy between different competences and sources of knowledge allowing dealing with complex and interlined problems.&lt;ref name="Dedeurwaerdere, 2007"/&gt;

== Enhancement of Corporate Social Responsibility ==

As increasing amounts of scientific data validate concerns about the deterioration of our environment, the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in network governance is being utilized in ever-increasing ways to halt or at least slow this deterioration. One of the ways they are accomplishing this is by directing their activities to focus on improving [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] (CSR). As a concept, CSR has existed since the first business was formed in civilization. The French philosopher Rousseau described it as the "social contract" between business and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rousseau | first = Jean-Jacques | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica, Vol 26 | location = Chicago | pages = 938–942 | isbn = 9780852297872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As theories about CSR have evolved in keeping with their times, today it is increasingly associated with sustainable practices and development, meaning that businesses have a "moral responsibility" to conduct their operations in an ecologically sustainable manner.&lt;ref name="Bichta, C. 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bichta | first = Constantina | title = Corporate social responsibility: a role in government policy and regulation? | publisher = [[University of Bath]], School of Management | location = Bath | url = http://www.bath.ac.uk/management/cri/pubpdf/Research_Reports/16_Bichta.pdf | year = 2003 | oclc = 53860209 | access-date = 8 November 2011 }} Research report no. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer acceptable for corporations just to grow "the bottom line" and increase profits for their shareholders. Businesses remain free to pursue profits but are increasingly obligated to minimize their negative impact on the environment.&lt;ref name="Bichta, C. 2003"/&gt;

Network governance, in the form of NGOs, is effectively bringing to light "bad practices" by corporations, as well as highlighting those actively working to reduce their carbon footprints.  Private governance networks such as CSRHUB and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) are entities that hold corporations accountable for their amount of corporate social responsibility. Founded to accelerate solutions to climate change and water management, the CDP discloses information and data on water management, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change strategies on over 3,000 companies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Carbon Disclosure Project, CDP What We Do Online | url = https://www.cdproject.net/en-US/WhatWeDo/Pages/overview.aspx | access-date = 9 November 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111103113627/https://www.cdproject.net/en-US/WhatWeDo/Pages/overview.aspx | archivedate = 3 November 2011 | df = dmy-all }} [Not dated.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only global climate change reporting system and encourages corporations to engage in "best practices" regarding environmental impact by making their formerly private or unknown environmental impact information available to anyone, including the general public. This information can be used  (by a variety of entities) to make consumer purchase and investment decisions, formulate governmental as well as corporate policy, educate people,  develop less harmful business methods for corporations and formulate action plans by environmental advocacy groups, to name a few.  "The first step towards managing carbon emissions is to measure them because in business what gets measured gets managed. The Carbon Disclosure Project has played a crucial role in encouraging companies to take the first steps in that measurement and management path".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Synergy Carbon, Carbon Strategy Services Online |url = http://www.synergycarbon.com/carbon-strategy-services | date = 2006 | access-date = 10 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This quote by Lord Adair Turner, Chairman of the UK Financial Services Authority, illustrates how network governance is enhancing CSR.

Leading European business schools joined with more than sixty multinationals to launch the [[Academy of Business in Society]], the mission of which is to push CSR to the forefront of business practice. Their main activities in pursuing this goal are: 1 )developing ‘best-in-class’ training practices and learning resources for businesses and corporate academies, 2) including the changing role of business in society in business education and 3) creating a global research bank on the role of business in society and delivering interdisciplinary research on CSR.&lt;ref name="Bichta, C. 2003"/&gt;  This is an example of network governance using education to improve Corporate Social Responsibility. Use of organization of networks in today’s society is a valid means of moving forward in preserving our environment.

'''''Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annotated Bibliography of books by Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter|url=https://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/library/carterbi.phtml|website=www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov|accessdate=16 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller]] book written by [[Jimmy Carter]], 39th [[President of the United States]] (1977–1981) and laureate of the 2002 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].  It was published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;According to https://www.nytimes.com/pages/books/bestseller/index.html "Best Sellers: Hardcover Nonfiction", ''New York Times'', accessed 27 January 2007: ''Palestine Peace Not Apartheid'' was number 6 on the list as of date accessed.  It was listed as number 11 in [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/18/books/bestseller/0318besthardnonfiction.html?pagewanted=print "New York Times Best Sellers: Hardcover Nonfiction"] on 18 March 2007, on the list for 15 weeks for the week ending 3 March 2007. As of 6 May 2007 it no longer appears on the expanded list featured at that site&lt;/ref&gt;

During his presidency, Carter hosted [[Camp David Accords|talks]] between [[Menachem Begin]] of [[Israel]] and [[Anwar Sadat]] of [[Egypt]] that led to the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]]. In this book Carter argues that Israel's continued control and [[Israeli settlement|colonization of Palestinian land]] have been the primary obstacles to a comprehensive peace agreement in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name=chap17&gt;http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?tab=1&amp;pid=522298&amp;agid=2 Excerpt: Chapter 17: "Summary," online posting, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], accessed 27 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; That perspective, coupled with ''[[Israel and the apartheid analogy|Apartheid]]'' in the titular phrase ''Peace Not Apartheid'' (which many regard as a subtitle) and allegations of errors and misstatements in the book, sparked criticism. Carter has defended his book and countered that response to it "in the real world…has been overwhelmingly positive."&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Jimmy|title=Speaking frankly about Israel and Palestine|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/la-oe-carter8dec08-story.html|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=16 April 2017|date=8 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary, ''[[Man from Plains]]'' (2007), explores the former president's post–White House role in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

==Purpose, main argument, and major points==

==="The ultimate purpose"===
{{quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;The ultimate purpose of my book is to present facts about the Middle East that are largely unknown in America, to precipitate discussion and to help restart peace talks (now absent for six years) that can lead to permanent peace for Israel and its neighbors.  Another hope is that [[Jews]] and other Americans who share this same goal might be motivated to express their views, even publicly, and perhaps in concert. I would be glad to help with that effort.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

===Thesis: How to achieve "permanent peace in the Middle East"===
Carter identifies "two interrelated obstacles to permanent peace in the Middle East":{{quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;
[1] Some [[Israelis]] believe they have the right to [[Confiscation|confiscate]] and [[Colony|colonize]] Palestinian land and try to justify the sustained subjugation and persecution of increasingly hopeless and aggravated Palestinians; and&lt;br&gt;
[2] Some [[Palestinians]] react by honoring [[suicide bomber]]s as [[martyr]]s to be rewarded in heaven and consider the killing of Israelis as victories.&lt;ref name=chap17/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

To bring an end to what he calls "this continuing tragedy", in Chapter 17 ("Summary"), Carter calls for a revitalization of the peace process based on the following three "key requirements":

{{quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''a. The security of Israel must be guaranteed''' ... &lt;br&gt;
'''b. The internal debate within Israel must be resolved in order to define Israel's permanent legal boundary''' ...&lt;br&gt;
'''c. The sovereignty of all Middle East nations and sanctity of international borders must be honored''' ...&lt;ref name=chap17/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

===The Apartheid analogy===
Regarding the use of the word "Apartheid" in the title of his book, Carter has said:

{{quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;"It's not Israel. The book has nothing to do with what's going on inside Israel which is a wonderful democracy, you know, where everyone has guaranteed equal rights and where, under the law, Arabs and Jews who are Israelis have the same privileges about Israel.  That's been most of the controversy because people assume it's about Israel. It's not.&lt;ref name="LifeAndTimesTranscript"&gt;[http://legacy.kcet.org/lifeandtimes/archives/200612/20061214.php Life &amp; Times – Transcript – 12/14/06]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I've never alleged that the framework of apartheid existed within Israel at all, and that what does exist in the West Bank is based on trying to take Palestinian land and not on racism. So it was a very clear distinction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0701/21/le.01.html | work=CNN | accessdate=2010-05-05 | title=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

==="Some major points"===
In his [[op-ed]] titled "Reiterating the Keys to Peace", published in [[The Boston Globe]] on 20 December 2006, Carter summarizes "[s]ome major points in the book":
{{quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Multiple deaths of innocent civilians have occurred on both sides, and this [[violence]] and all terrorism must cease
*For 39 years, Israel has [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied Palestinian land]], and has [[confiscated]] and [[Colonisation|colonized]] hundreds of choice sites
*Often excluded from their former homes, land, and places of worship, protesting Palestinians have been severely dominated and oppressed. There is forced [[Racial segregation|segregation]] between [[Israeli settler]]s and Palestine's citizens, with a complex [[pass system]] required for Arabs to traverse Israel's multiple [[security checkpoint|checkpoint]]s
*An enormous wall snakes through populated areas of what is left of the [[West Bank]], constructed on wide swaths of bulldozed trees and property of Arab families, obviously designed to acquire more territory and to protect the [[Israeli colonies]] already built. ([[Hamas]] declared a unilateral [[cease-fire]] in August 2004 as its candidates sought local and then national offices, which they claim is the reason for reductions in casualties to Israeli citizens.)
*Combined with this wall, Israeli control of the [[Jordan River]] Valley will completely enclose Palestinians in their shrunken and divided territory. Gaza is surrounded by a similar barrier with only two openings, still controlled by Israel. The crowded citizens have no free access to the outside world by air, sea, or land
*The Palestinian people are now being deprived of the necessities of life by economic restrictions imposed on them by Israel and the United States because 42 percent voted for Hamas candidates in this year's election. Teachers, nurses, policemen, firemen and other employees cannot be paid, and the UN has reported food supplies in Gaza equivalent to those among the poorest families in [[sub-Sahara Africa]], with half the families surviving on one meal a day
*[[Mahmoud Abbas]], first as prime minister and now as president of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and leader of the [[PLO]], has sought to negotiate with Israel for almost six years, without success. Hamas leaders support such negotiations, promising to accept the results if approved by a Palestinian [[referendum]]
*[[UN Resolutions]], the [[Camp David Accords]] of 1978, the [[Oslo Agreement]] of 1993, official US Policy, and the [[International Roadmap for Peace]] are all based on the premise that Israel withdraw from [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]]. Also, Palestinians must accept the same commitment made by the 23 Arab nations in 2002: to recognize Israel's right to live in peace within its legal borders. These are the two keys to peace&lt;ref name=reiterating&gt;Jimmy Carter, http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/12/20/reiterating_the_keys_to_peace/ "Reiterating the Keys to Peace," ''Boston Globe'' 20 December 2006, accessed 3 January 2007.

==Critical reaction and commentary==
{{Main article|Commentary on Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid}}
Critical response to ''Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid'' has been mixed. According to Julie Bosman, criticism of the book "has escalated to a full-scale furor," much of which has focused on Carter's use of the word "[[apartheid]]" in the subtitle.&lt;ref name=Bosman&gt;Julie Bosman, https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/books/14cart.html?fta=y "Carter View of Israeli 'Apartheid' Stirs Furor," ''[[The New York Times]]'' 12 December 2006, accessed 28 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics, including several leaders of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and of [[American Jew]]ish organizations, have interpreted the subtitle as an [[Israel and the apartheid analogy|allegation of Israeli apartheid]], which they believe to be inflammatory and unsubstantiated.&lt;ref name=BrandeisNews&gt;http://my.brandeis.edu/news/item?news_item_id=7816 "Brandeis News: Full coverage of the Historic Jan. 23rd Visit by Former President Jimmy Carter," [[Brandeis University]], 24 January 2007, accessed 27 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zeller&gt;Tom Zeller, Jr., http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/carter-and-his-critics-the-skirmishes-continue/ "Carter and His Critics: The Skirmishes Continue," ''New York Times'', The Lede (blog), 12 January 2007, assessed 12 January 2007; includes {{cite web |url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/thelede/posts/CarterCenter.pdf |title=Letter of resignation dated 11 January 2007}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(79.4&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pfeiffer&gt;Eric Pfeiffer,  http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070125-112710-7481r.htm "Carter Apologizes for 'stupid' Book Passage,"] ''[[The Washington Times|Washington Times]]'' 26 January 2007, accessed 26 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tony Karon]], Senior Editor at [[TIME.com]] and a former anti-Apartheid activist for the [[ANC]], said: " Jimmy Carter had to write this book precisely because Palestinian life and history is not accorded equal value in American discourse, far from it. And his use of the word apartheid is not only morally valid; it is essential, because it shakes the moral stupor that allows many liberals to rationalize away the daily, grinding horror being inflicted on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza".&lt;ref&gt;[http://tonykaron.com/2006/12/22/israel-and-apartheid-in-defense-of-jimmy-carter/ Israel and Apartheid: In Defense of Jimmy Carter](December 22, 2006) retrieved 19/09/12&lt;/ref&gt; Former President [[Bill Clinton]] wrote a brief letter to the chairman of the [[American Jewish Committee]], thanking him for articles criticizing the book and citing his agreement with [[Dennis Ross]]'s attempts to "straighten ... out" Carter's claims and conclusions about Clinton's own summer 2000 Camp David peace proposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=1531911&amp;ct=3698445 "President Clinton Thanks AJC on Carter Book"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808035212/http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=1531911&amp;ct=3698445 |date=2007-08-08 }}, press release, [[American Jewish Committee]], n.d., accessed 3 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Siegel&gt;Cf.

Critics claim that Carter crossed the line into anti-Semitism. [[Abraham Foxman]], the national director of the [[Anti-Defamation League]], initially accused Carter of "engaging in anti-Semitism" in the book; Foxman told [[James Traub]] later that he would not call the former president himself an "anti-Semite" or a "bigot".&lt;ref name=Besser&gt;James D.

==Carter's response to criticism of the book==
{{Further|Commentary on Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid#Carter's response to criticism of the book}}
Carter has responded to negative reviews in the mainstream [[news media]] in an op-ed published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (which was excerpted in ''[[The Guardian]]'' and elsewhere):
{{quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;Book reviews in the mainstream media have been written mostly by representatives of Jewish organizations who would be unlikely to visit the occupied territories, and their primary criticism is that the book is [[criticism of Israel|anti-Israel]]. Two members of [[US Congress|Congress]] have been publicly critical. Incoming Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] for instance, issued a statement (before the book was published) saying that "he does not speak for the [[US Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] on Israel." Some reviews posted on [[Amazon.com]] call me "anti-Semitic", and others accuse the book of "lies" and "distortions. A former Carter Center fellow has taken issue with it, and Alan Dershowitz called the book's title "indecent."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Out in the real world, however, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. I've signed books in five stores, with more than 1,000 buyers at each site. I've had one negative remark — that I should be tried for [[treason]] — and one caller on [[C-SPAN]] said that I was an anti-Semite. My most troubling experience has been the rejection of my offers to speak, for free, about the book on [[university]] campuses with high Jewish enrollment and to answer questions from students and professors. I have been most encouraged by prominent Jewish citizens and members of Congress who have thanked me privately for presenting the facts and some new ideas.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;Jimmy Carter, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,1970058,00.html "Israel, Palestine, Peace and Apartheid,"] London ''The Guardian'' 12 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

He also wrote a "[[Letter to Jewish Citizens of America]]" explaining "his use of the term 'apartheid' and sympathizing with Israelis who fear terrorism."&lt;ref name=APLetter&gt;[[Associated Press]], http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/16/america/NA_GEN_US_Jimmy_Carter_Criticism.php "Carter Explains Apartheid Reference in Letter to US Jews,", ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', 15 December 2006, accessed 12 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report updated by the [[Associated Press]] after the publication of Carter's "Letter to Jewish Citizens of America", [[Greg Bluestein]] observes that Carter replied generally to complaints of the book's errors and inaccuracies by [[Dennis Ross]], [[Alan Dershowitz]], [[Kenneth Stein]], the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], and others by pointing out that the [[Carter Center]] staff as well as an "unnamed 'distinguished' reporter" fact-checked it.&lt;ref name=APLetter/&gt;&lt;ref name="CarterJV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jacksonville.com/apnews/stories/120806/D8LSR7J03.shtml |title=Carter defends his book's criticism of Israeli policy |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]] |date=8 December 2006 |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachel Zelkowitz]] points out that, as cited in various news accounts, "Carter has consistently defended his book's accuracy against Stein and other critics"; in a prepared statement, Carter's press secretary [[Deanna Congileo]] responds "that Carter had his book reviewed for accuracy throughout the writing process" and that "[a]s with all of President Carter's previous books, any detected errors will be corrected in later editions . .

==Public and other programs pertaining to the book==
Carter has said that debate on Israel-related issues is muffled in the [[US media]] by lobbying efforts of the [[Israel lobby in the United States|pro-Israel lobby]]: "[M]any controversial issues concerning Palestine and the path to peace for Israel are intensely debated among Israelis and throughout other nations — but not in the United States. . . . This reluctance to criticize any policies of the Israeli government is because of the extraordinary lobbying efforts of the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee|American-Israel Political Action Committee]] [sic] and the absence of any significant contrary voices."&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carter/&gt;  He stresses that through the debate among others that he hopes this book will stimulate and through his own related public-speaking and media appearances, he hopes to tear down the "impenetrable wall" that stops the people of the US from seeing the plight of Palestinians.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carter/&gt;

===Brandeis University visit===
In early December 2006 [[Brandeis University]] invited Carter to visit the university to debate his book with [[Alan Dershowitz]]. Carter declined that invitation, explaining: "I don't want to have a conversation even indirectly with Dershowitz.  There is no need to for me to debate somebody who, in my opinion, knows nothing about the situation in Palestine."  Carter said that the Brandeis debate request, "is proof that many in the United States are unwilling to hear an alternative view on the nation's most taboo foreign policy issue, Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory," adding: "There is no debate in America about anything that would be critical of Israel."&lt;ref name=Stockman&gt;Farah Stockman and Marcella Bombardieri, http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/12/15/carter_book_wont_stir_brandeis_debate/ "Carter Book Won't Stir Brandeis Debate: Ex-president Was to Outline View on Palestinians," ''Boston Globe'' 15 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Dershowitz criticized Carter's refusal to debate him, asserting: "Carter’s refusal to debate wouldn't be so strange if it weren't for the fact that he claims that he wrote the book precisely so as to start debate over the issue of the Israel-Palestine peace process. If that were really true, Carter would be thrilled to have the opportunity to debate."&lt;ref name=DershowitzGlobe&gt;[[Alan Dershowitz]], http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/12/21/why_wont_carter_debate_his_book/ "Why Won't Carter Debate His Book?" ''Boston Globe'' 21 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote in ''The Case Against Israel's Enemies'' that Carter's accusation of his ignorance was untrue "since we had discussed my several visits to the Palestinian Authority during our conversation only months earlier in Herzliya."&lt;ref&gt;''The Case Against Israel's Enemies'', 20&lt;/ref&gt; {{Further|Alan Dershowitz#Jimmy Carter's book Palestine Peace Not Apartheid|Alan Dershowitz#Alan Dershowitz and Jimmy Carter}}

In a Boston Globe article of 22 December 2006, Professor Patricia Johnston said she and many colleagues had offered to chip in perhaps $100 each to pay for whatever travel and security costs a Carter visit would entail.  "Who is Alan Dershowitz?" Johnston said. Carter "is the former president of the United States, who has done so much to further the cause of peace in the Middle East and elsewhere. It's an insult to suggest that he should have to defend himself that way."  She said she envisioned Carter giving a traditional speech and taking audience questions.&lt;ref name="BrandeisGroup"&gt;http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/12/22/brandeis_group_pursues_carter_visit/ "Brandeis Group Pursues Carter Visit: Professors Call Debate an Insult", ''Boston Globe'' 22 December 2006, accessed 2 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 December 2006, [[WCVB-TV]] (an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] affiliate), reported that "[a]bout 100 students, faculty and alumni of [[Brandeis University]] have signed an online petition to push the administration to bring former President Carter to campus to discuss his new book on Palestine, without being required to debate it."&lt;ref name="Bostonstudents"&gt;http://www.thebostonchannel.com/news/10609718/detail.html "Brandeis Students Support Carter Visit: Students, Faculty Sign Online Petition", (updated) online posting, ''TheBostonChannel.com'', WCVB-TV, Channel 5, Boston, 26 December 2006, accessed 26 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Boston Globe'' reports that since it initially revealed "that Carter felt unwelcome on the Waltham campus, people have argued over whether he is unwilling to answer for his views, or whether Brandeis, which was founded by the American Jewish community, can't tolerate criticism of Israel.  The latter is a view that some professors hope they can dispel by reviving the Carter visit."&lt;ref name="BrandeisGroup"/&gt;

On 10 January 2007, it was reported that President Carter would discuss ''Palestine Peace Not Apartheid'' at Brandeis University but that he would "not, however, debate the book with" Dershowitz.&lt;ref name=AccessNoGa/&gt;  Brandeis officials reported that Carter would "be the first former president to visit Brandeis since Harry Truman delivered the commencement address in 1957.... It will be Carter's first visit to a university to discuss the book, [Carter's spokeswoman Deanna] Congileo said", confirming also "the president has set no conditions and would answer as many questions as possible"; Carter plans to "speak for about 15 minutes and then answer questions for 45 minutes during the visit."

The speech, which occurred on 23 January 2007, was "closed to the public and limited to 'members of the university community only'"; nevertheless, Dershowitz said that he still planned to "attend and question Carter": "'I will be the first person to have my hand up to ask him a question,' he said. 'I guarantee that they won't stop me from attending.'"&lt;ref name=Daily&gt;[[Associated Press]], http://www.dailynewstribune.com/homepage/8999010617448726527 "President Carter Will Come to Brandeis," ''[[Daily News Tribune]]'' 11 January 2007, accessed 11 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January 2007 news outlets reported Brandeis' announcement that while Dershowitz could not attend Carter's speech, after it ended he would have the stage for a "rebuttal."&lt;ref name=Drosjack&gt;Melissa Drosjack, [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,244303,00.html "Brandeis University to Allow Rebuttal After Carter Speech,"] ''[[Fox News]]'', 18 January 2007, accessed 19 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{Further|Alan Dershowitz#Jimmy Carter's book Palestine Peace Not Apartheid}}

The day after the speech (24 January 2007), ''The New York Times'' reported on the program: "Questions were preselected by the committee that invited Mr. Carter, and the questioners included an Israeli student and a Palestinian student .  After Mr. Carter left, Mr. Dershowitz spoke in the same gymnasium, saying that the former president oversimplified the situation and that his conciliatory and sensible-sounding speech at Brandeis belied his words in some other interviews."&lt;ref&gt;Pam Belluck, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/us/24carter.html?_r=1&amp;ref=us&amp;oref=slogin "Jimmy Carter Responds to Critics at Brandeis,"]  ''New York Times'' 24 January 2007, accessed 24 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to David Weber, of [[ABC News]], Carter said "that he stood by the book and its title, that he apologized for what he called an 'improper and stupid' sentence in the book [which he acknowledged seemed to justify terrorism by saying that suicide bombings should end when Israel accepts the goals of the road map to peace with Palestinians and which he had already instructed his publisher to remove from its future editions,] and that he had been disturbed by accusations that he was anti-Semitic....  [Carter]...acknowledged...that 'Palestine Peace Not Apartheid' has 'caused great concern in the Jewish community,' but noted that it has nonetheless prompted discussion."&lt;ref name=Pfeiffer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Weber, [http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2816533 Carter: Book Has Prompted Discussion,"] ''ABC News'' 23 January 2007, accessed 24 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Abel and James Vaznis, http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/01/24/carter_wins_applause_at_brandeis/ "Carter Wins Applause at Brandeis: Defends Stance on Palestinians; Critic Speaks Later", ''Boston Globe'' 24 January 2007, accessed 25 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  An editorial published in the [[Waltham, Massachusetts]] newspaper, the ''[[Daily News Tribune]]'', concludes: "Carter succeeded in bringing to Brandeis a productive, civil debate."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailynewstribune.com/opinion/8998980546956623871 "Editorial: Carter Brings a Productive, Civil Debate," ''Daily News Tribune'' 25 January 2007, accessed 25 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Videotaped excerpts from Carter's visit to Brandeis were featured on several national news programs in the United States, such as [[NBC]]'s morning program ''[[Today (NBC Program)|Today]]'', along with follow-up interviews with Carter.&lt;ref name=CarterToday&gt;http://video.msn.com/v/us/msnbc.htm?g=5E19CE84-8968-417A-A959-D323DF12BCEF&amp;f=00&amp;fg=copy "Carter on His Book's Controversy," ''Today'' 26 January 2007, accessed 26 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the visit, major donors told Brandeis University that they will no longer give it money in "retaliation", according to [[Stuart Eizenstat]], chief domestic policy adviser and executive director of the White House Domestic Policy Staff during Carter's presidency and a current trustee of Brandeis, as quoted in ''[[The Jewish Week]]'' in mid-February 2007.&lt;ref name=Cohler-Esses&gt;Larry Cohler-Esses, [http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=13674 "Brandeis Donors Exact Revenge For Carter Visit:] Major Givers Reportedly Withholding Funds from School, Sparking Fierce Free-Speech Debate on Massachusetts Campus", ''The Jewish Week'', 16 February 2006, accessed 23 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Man from Plains'': Documentary feature film by Jonathan Demme===

===Carter Center conversation===
On 22 February 2007 Carter participated in a "conversation" about ''Palestine Peace Not Apartheid'' with former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine Albright]] at the [[Carter Center]], moderated by Conflict Resolution Program Director Matthew Hodes. The event became sold out in early January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cartercenter.org/involved/conversations/index.html Conversations at the Carter Center 2006–2007, accessed 24 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The event was simultaneously webcast in the Carter Center's online "multi-media" section, and the Center's website now includes a direct link to the "archived webcast."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cartercenter.org/multimedia/conversations2.07.ram Palestine Peace Not Apartheid, ''Carter Center'', [[RealPlayer]] media file (Updated), accessed 25 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Washington University visit===
On 8 March 2007 [[George Washington University]] hosted a visit by Carter during which he discussed his book.  According to reporter [[Beth Schwartzapfel]], in ''[[The Forward]]'', a group of Jewish students led by Robert Fishman, executive director of the campus [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life|Hillel]], dominated the microphones, preventing other students from asking questions, while asking questions critical of Carter prepared, forwarded, and distributed to them in advance by faculty and students at [[Emory University]] as if they were their own questions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The sheet distributed to students listed five questions. Among the issues raised were Carter's refusal to debate Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz and former U.S. Middle East negotiator [[Dennis Ross]]; continuing Palestinian violence in Gaza; Carter's assertion that Israel did not accept Clinton's peace proposal; whether donations from the [[Saudi royal family]] explains {{sic}} the failure of the Carter Center to criticize [[human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia]], and Carter's decision to use the word "apartheid" in his book's title.

One of the students involved in distributing the handout, Aviva Berman, said that four of the five questions came directly from a list prepared by [[Deborah Lipstadt]] and other professors at Emory University, prior to Carter's appearance at the school's Atlanta campus. "When Carter came to speak at Emory, they had those questions made up, so they just forwarded them to me", she said.&lt;ref name=Schwartzapfel&gt;Beth Schwartzapfel, http://www.forward.com/articles/hillel-director-students-defend-tactics-at-carter/ "Hillel Director, Students Defend Tactics at Carter Speech", ''The Jewish Daily Forward'', 22 March 2007, accessed 22 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schwartzapfel also cites "[a] video of the event, posted to the G.W. Web site, [which] shows that Carter received several standing ovations and long stretches of applause."&lt;ref&gt;For the video of the event posted on server of George Washington University, see http://www.gwu.edu/%7Enewsctr/audiovideo/JimmyCarter.ram Jimmy Carter speech and Q&amp;A, RealPlayer video clip, 8 March 2007, accessed 22 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; "But", Schwartzapfel continues, "an Associated Press story that ran immediately after the event characterized the audience as 'polite but mostly critical,'" adding: "Jack Stokes, an A.P. spokesman, told the Forward that the article's description of the audience 'was based on reporter [[Barry Schweid]]'s observation of the speech, as well as the subsequent Q&amp;A Carter engaged in with the students. The A.P. story stands as written.'"&lt;ref name=Schwartzapfel/&gt;

Schweid observes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the storm it ignited, former President Carter held fast on Thursday to his accusation that Israel oppresses the Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza and seeks to colonize the land. Speaking at The George Washington University to a polite but mostly critical student audience, Carter offered no second thoughts on his book "Palestine Peace Not Apartheid". ... He said he was not accusing Israel of racism nor referring to its treatment of Arabs within the country. "I defined apartheid very carefully" as "the forced segregation by one people of another" on their own land, he said.&lt;ref name=Schweid&gt;Barry Schweid ([[Associated Press]]), https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/08/AR2007030801256.html "Carter Defends Gaza Theory at GWU Speech", ''The Washington Post'' 8 March 2007, accessed 22 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schwartzapfel reports, however:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Brian Hennessey, vice president of the [[Vineeta Foundation]], which is making a documentary on Carter, alleged to the Forward that he witnessed G.W. Hillel director Robert Fishman and several Jewish students conspiring to control the Q&amp;A session. According to Hennessey, a handout was distributed with negative questions and then the students strategically grabbed the seats closest to the microphones. Hennessey said that he overheard people in the group saying that the point of their strategy was to make sure that Carter, whose book, ''Palestine Peace Not Apartheid'', faced only tough questions.

In the end, most of the eight questions fielded by Carter at the March 8 event took a pro-Israel tack in challenging the former president. Four of the students read their questions off of the sheet distributed beforehand.&lt;ref name=Schwartzapfel/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fishman told the Forward, Schwartzapfel reports further: "'You know how we did it, honestly? ... We said, "Let's sit near the microphones." They each had a copy of the questions, and then they stood on line.'"&lt;ref name=Schwartzapfel/&gt; Yet, she adds: "Hennessey asserted that the maneuver ended up influencing media coverage of the event. 'This small group successfully outgunned the microphones and managed to give some journalists this totally erroneous impression that that was how the student body felt about Carter,' he said."&lt;ref name=Schwartzapfel/&gt; Whereas "Hennessey, who described Carter's book as 'very courageous,' contended that the G.W. students 'very successfully stood up and blocked anyone else from asking a question,'" Schwartzapfel continues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Berman insisted that she and her fellow pro-Israel students did nothing wrong. It wasn’t his [Fishman's] group's responsibility "to let other people ask questions", he said. "If they wanted to get to the microphone quicker, they could have."&lt;br&gt;
Fishman also rejected the assertion that the students' tactics were improper.&lt;br&gt;
"There was nothing done in there to stop anyone from asking questions", Fishman said. "It's important that, when you have that many people in the room who may not be familiar with the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli–Palestinian situation]], those people have the opportunity also to hear those areas that are questionable in the book."&lt;br&gt;
In that sense, Fishman said, his group's approach "is what [[dialogue]] is about."&lt;ref name=Schwartzapfel/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===University of Iowa visit===
Pointing out that "The former president rarely speaks about his book at universities. He says he’s been invited to more than 100 campuses, but he's only visited five," Claire Keller reported that, during his public appearance at the [[University of Iowa]], in Iowa City, on 18 April 2007,&lt;ref name=UIowa&gt;http://news-releases.uiowa.edu/2007/april/041107carter-tickets.html "University of Iowa News Release", press release, University of Iowa, 11 April 2007, accessed 12 June 2007 (provides related links)&lt;/ref&gt;  Carter stated:  "I wrote this book to describe the plight of the Palestinians and because I'm convinced we desperately need debate about where we are and where we ought to be going, and how to rejuvenate the non-existent peace process in the Middle East" ... [and that] Carter says the book's objective is permanent peace for Israel and its neighbors; it’s something the former president says he’s dedicated his entire adult life to.&lt;ref name=Kellett&gt;Claire Kellett, [http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/7092956.html "Jimmy Carter Visits Iowa City"], [[KCRG-TV|KCRG]], 18 April 2007, updated 19 April 2007, accessed 11 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

While Kellett states that "Many in attendance applaud his efforts," she also provides the following qualification: "But others criticize the author, claiming his book contains factual errors and misstatements. Members of the local Jewish community say it's simply one-sided."&lt;ref name=Kellett/&gt;  She quotes Tali Ariav of the Hillel Jewish Student Center on the Iowa campus, who stated: "'I am an Israeli so of course I served in the military, so I feel emotionally involved, but I feel every person, every American, every thinker needs to think twice about Carter's opinion, because it's not right' ..."&lt;ref name=Kellett/&gt;  Nevertheless, Keller adds: "Carter adamantly defends the accuracy of his book, saying he wrote every word himself."&lt;ref name=Kellett/&gt;

===University of California, Irvine visit===
On 3 May 2007, Carter presented a lecture and participated in a discussion relating to the book in conjunction with the Center for the Study of Democracy and Model United Nations, in association with the Center for Citizen Peacebuilding, Department of Political Science, at the [[University of California, Irvine]]. According to Carter's lecture transcript the former president, in answering a question on whether conflict between pro and anti-Israel student groups obstructs chances of peace, said, "I think an altercation or debate or sometimes even an uncomfortable confrontation on a college campus in America is a good move in the right direction. But I would like to see the leaders of those two groups form a combined group that would take advantage of my invitation to go to Palestine and see what’s going on."&lt;ref&gt;Center for the Study of Democracy and Model United Nations, "Jimmy Carter", Carter Lecture Transcript http://www.socsci.uci.edu/events/carter/transcript.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mozambican National Resistance''' ('''RENAMO'''; {{lang-pt|'''Resistência Nacional Moçambicana'''}}) is a militant organization and political movement in [[Mozambique]]. Sponsored by the [[Rhodesia]]n [[Central Intelligence Organisation]] (CIO), it was founded in 1975 as part of an [[anti-communist]] backlash against the country's ruling [[FRELIMO]] party.

Initially led by [[André Matsangaissa]], a former senior official in FRELIMO's armed wing, the movement had its roots in a menagerie of anti-FRELIMO dissident groups which mushroomed immediately prior and shortly following Mozambican independence, as well as [[South Africa]]n and Rhodesian attempts to encourage these competing interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg-e.org/geh01/geh16.html|title=''Binding Memories'': Chronology|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emerson2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emerson|first=Stephen A.|title=The Battle for Mozambique: The Frelimo_Renamo Struggle, 1977_1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AKlZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48|date=19 February 2014|publisher=Helion and Company|isbn=978-1-909384-92-7|pages=74–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that RENAMO's ranks were bolstered by Mozambican political exiles who genuinely opposed FRELIMO in principle, and a number of others who were conscripted by force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watch|first=Human Rights|title=Conspicuous destruction: war, famine and the reform process in Mozambique|year=1992|publisher=Human Rights Watch|location=New York u.a.|isbn=978-1-56432-079-7|pages=86–88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PkGpxJaAIIC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Teodato+Hunguana&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PnOSTZuHK4S4sQP_8vm-BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Teodato%20Hunguana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 October 1992, FRELIMO and RENAMO signed the [[Rome General Peace Accords]], ending the [[Mozambican Civil War]].

Critics of RENAMO frequently decried the movement as a "proxy army" of Rhodesia and later, of South Africa's [[apartheid]] government.&lt;ref name=Oz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.monash.edu.au/publications/eras/edition-11/articles/drobinson.pdf |title=Renamo, Malawi and the struggle to succeed Banda: Assessing theories of Malawian intervention in the Mozambican Civil War |publisher=http://www.arts.monash.edu.au |date=2009-11-11 |accessdate=2016-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328161718/http://www.arts.monash.edu.au/publications/eras/edition-11/articles/drobinson.pdf |archivedate=28 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been theorised that RENAMO was formed for the sole purpose of combating Mozambican support for Rhodesian insurgents.&lt;ref name=Conc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-r.org/downloads/Accord%20Mozambique_Key%20actors.pdf |title=Key Actors in the War and Peace Process |publisher=[[Conciliation Resources]] |date=January 1998|accessdate=2016-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309230400/http://www.c-r.org/downloads/Accord%20Mozambique_Key%20actors.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, RENAMO was also reflective of FRELIMO's own splintering support base and dwindling popularity in the post-independence era.&lt;ref name="Emerson2014"/&gt; Following the war it has been responsible for promoting constitutional reform as well as a strong domestic private sector.&lt;ref name=Manifesto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kas.de/upload/dokumente/attv0kxy.pdf |title=Main Renamo Policy Guidelines |publisher=RENAMO-UNIÃO ELEITORAL |date=2004 |accessdate=2016-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610215141/http://www.kas.de/upload/dokumente/attv0kxy.pdf |archivedate=10 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Civil War==
In 1984 the South African and Mozambican governments signed the [[Nkomati Accord]],&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, P.J., Earle, A., Malzbender, D., Moloi, M.B.H., Patrick, M.J. &amp; Turton, A.R. 2005. ''A Compilation of all the international freshwater agreements entered into by South Africa with other States''. Pretoria: Water Research Commission; and Turton, A.R. 2003. ''The political aspects of institutional development in the water sector: South Africa and its International River Basions'' D.Phil. Thesis. Pretoria: Pretoria University; and Turton, A.R. 2007. ''The Hydropolitics of Cooperation: South Africa during the Cold War''. In Grover, V.E. (ed). ''Water: A source of conflict or cooperation?'' Enfield: Science Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; in which South Africa agreed to stop sponsoring RENAMO if the Mozambican government expelled exiled members of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) residing there. This was consistent with the [[Total National Strategy]] then in existence whereby the carrot of infrastructural development projects would be offered as an inducement for co-operation, supported by the stick of military reprisal if guerillas of the ANC were still given succour.&lt;ref&gt;Geldenhuys, D. 1984. ''The Diplomacy of Isolation: South African Foreign Policy Making''. Johannesburg: MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Mozambican government did not expel the exiled members of the ANC and consequently the South African government continued funnelling financial and military resources until a permanent [[Rome General Peace Accords|peace accord]] was reached in 1992 and was supervised by the United Nations Operation in Mozambique ([[ONUMOZ]]) until 1994. To nudge this process in the right direction a special operation was launched by the National Intelligence Service called [[Operation Bush Talk]], which was designed to permanently end the civil war in Mozambique to stem the flow of military materiel across the porous borders into South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Turton. A.R. 2010. ''Shaking Hands with Billy''. Durban: Just Done Publications. http://www.shakinghandswithbilly.com&lt;/ref&gt; One manifestation of this was the militia of the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] (IFP) that was being trained and armed by the [[SADF]] Special Forces as part of [[Operation Marion]]&lt;ref&gt;Stiff, P. 1999. ''The Silent War: South African Recce Operations 1969–1994''. Alberton: Galago.&lt;/ref&gt; which were being armed by weapons coming from Mozambique.

The peace accord led to the disarmament of RENAMO, to the integration of some of its fighters into the Mozambican army and to its transformation into a regular political party.  It is now the main opposition party in Mozambique. At the [[legislative]] [[elections in Mozambique|elections]] on 1 and 2 December 2004, the party was the main part of the [[Renamo-UE]] electoral alliance, that won 29.7% of the popular vote and 90 out of 250 seats. The presidential candidate of this alliance, [[Afonso Dhlakama]], won 31.7% of the popular vote.

[[Raul Domingos]], negotiator at the [[Rome General Peace Accords]] and RENAMO's leader in parliament from 1994–1999, was expelled from the party in 2000, and in 2003, founded the [[Party for Peace, Democracy, and Development]].

===Activities in Zimbabwe===
RENAMO forces attacked an army base in [[Zimbabwe]] near [[Mukosa]] on 17 June 1987, killing seven soldiers and wounding 19. RENAMO attacked the Katiyo Tea Estate, destroying valuable property, in July and killed three men in Rushinga in August.&lt;ref name="earlyattacks"&gt;Audrey Kalley, Jacqueline. ''Southern African Political History: a chronological of key political events from independence to Mid-1997'', 1999. Page 739.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 November, RENAMO militants burned down 13 houses.&lt;ref name="juneattack"&gt;Audrey Kalley, Jacqueline. ''Southern African Political History: a chronological of key political events from independence to Mid-1997'', 1999. Page 742.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between December 1987 and 21 January 1988 RENAMO performed 101 attacks near the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border.&lt;ref name="juneattack"/&gt;

Following the end of the Mozambican Civil War, RENAMO remained linked to a Zimbabwean militant group, [[Chimwenje]].&lt;ref name=Handbook11&gt;{{cite book|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|editor1-last=Banks|editor1-first=Arthur|editor2-last=Muller|editor2-first=Thomas|editor3-last=Phelan|editor3-first=Sean|editor4-last=Smith|editor4-first=Hal|editor5-last=Milnor|editor5-first=Andrew|editor6-last=Kimmelman|editor6-first=Eric|editor7-last=Aytar|editor7-first=Volkan|editor8-last=Twetten|editor8-first=Matthew|editor9-last=Willey|editor9-first=Joseph|editor10-last=Tallman|editor10-first=Elaine|title=Political Handbook of the World: 1998|date=1998|pages=633–634, 1045–1046|publisher=CSA Publications|location=Binghampton, New York|isbn=978-1-349-14953-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renewed Clashes ==
{{main|RENAMO insurgency (2013–present)}}
In October 2012, RENAMO's headquarters were relocated near Casa Banana (also named Sathunjira, RENAMO's former guerrilla base in the 1980s) in [[Gorongosa]], where a training camp was set up  for around 800 partially armed followers. Previously, the headquarters had been moved from [[Maputo]] to [[Nampula]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southerntimesafrica.com/news_article.php?id=7690&amp;title=Dhlakama%20back%20in%20the%20bush "Dhlakama back in the bush"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215184608/http://www.southerntimesafrica.com/news_article.php?id=7690&amp;title=Dhlakama%20back%20in%20the%20bush |date=15 February 2015 }} ''Southerntimesafrica.com'', 29 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; RENAMO leader Afonso Dhlakama threatened to "destroy the country" if his political demands were not met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201211150280.html "Mozambique: Dhlakama Threatens to Destroy the Country"] ''[[All Africa]]'' (Agência de Informação de Moçambique), 14 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 April 2013, one woman and four police officers were killed, with ten policemen more injured in a RENAMO attack on a police station in the town of [[Muxengue]]. The leader of the attackers was also killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Five-killed-in-Mozambique-clashes-20130404 "Five killed in Mozambique clashes"] [[News24|''News 24'']], 4 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; RENAMO's security chief stated that the action was a response to previous police raids on RENAMO gatherings. Around 300 RENAMO members had remained armed since the 1992 peace deal, despite efforts to integrate them into the [[Military of Mozambique|army]] or police.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22031922 "Mozambican ex-rebels Renamo in police clash"] ''[[BBC]]'', 4 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April 2013, two or three civilians were killed and two women were injured when alleged RENAMO militiamen attacked a truck and a bus in [[Chibabava District]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/ec2b4f804f2c00379d619f1e5d06aea0/Renamo-attack-civilians-in-Intercape-bus-20130407 "Renamo attack civilians in Intercape bus"] ''[[SABC]]'' (SAPA-AFP), 7 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; RENAMO denied being involved in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Mozambique-bus-attack-controversy-20130407 "Mozambique bus attack controversy"] ''News 24'', 7 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June, suspected RENAMO guerrillas attacked a bus in [[Machanga]], [[Sofala Province]], injuring an elderly woman. The incident happened two days after RENAMO threatened to paralyse key roads and the only [[coal]] export train to force the FRELIMO government to renegotiate peace terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspected Renamo rebels attack bus in Mozambique|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/africa/2013/06/21/suspected-renamo-rebels-attack-bus-in-mozambique|publisher=[[The Times (South Africa)|''The Times'']] (Reuters)|date=21 June 2013|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October, suspected RENAMO guerrillas ambushed a military patrol near [[Gorongosa]], RENAMO's stronghold, killing seven soldiers, according to local media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/17/us-mozambique-guerrillas-idUSBRE99G0UG20131017 "Renamo rebels kill seven Mozambique soldiers": local media] ''[[Reuters]]'', 17 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October, another clash between [[Military of Mozambique|Mozambican Armed Forces]] (FADM) and RENAMO militiamen took place in Mucodza, seven kilometres away from Gorongosa. National director of defence policy in the Ministry of Defence, [[Colonel]] Cristovao Chume, claimed that the soldiers suffered no losses and that a RENAMO fighter was injured and captured by their forces. RENAMO leader Dhlakama claimed that no RENAMO fighters were killed on the attack, which, according to him, was started by the Army, and that the casualties had been suffered by the FADM. However, reporters confirmed that the bodies of two RENAMO fighters were in the local morgue of Gorongosa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezimbabwean.co/news/africa/68949/mozambique-two-renamo-members-killed.html "Mozambique: Two RENAMO members killed in Sofala clash"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131021225313/http://www.thezimbabwean.co/news/africa/68949/mozambique-two-renamo-members-killed.html |date=21 October 2013 }} ''Thezimbabwean.co'', 19 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October, FADM forces captured Sathunjira base after several days of combat. RENAMO spokesman Fernando Mazanga claimed that the government forces had shelled the base with heavy weapons (artillery), and that Afonso Dhlakama had fled the base. A RENAMO statement said that the capture of the base puts an end to the 1992 peace deal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24615549 "Mozambique 20-year peace deal 'ends after base raided'"] ''BBC'', 21 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; RENAMO announced that MP [[Armindo Milaco]] was killed in the government raid. On 22 October, gunmen attacked a police station in [[Maringué District]] in apparent retaliation, with no casualties reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201310301620.html "Mozambique Army Overruns Second Rebel Base"] ''Allafrica.com'' (''[[Cameroon Tribune]]''), 30 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October, alleged RENAMO fighters attacked civilian vehicles in the main north-south highway near [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], killing one and injuring 10 people. RENAMO denied its implication in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/10/mozambican-rebel-group-denies-attack-2013102795429330980.html|title=Mozambican rebel group denies attack|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 Peace Process===
On 5 September 2014 Dhlakama and president Guebuza signed a peace deal in an effort to end the two-year period of instability. The deal included integration of RENAMO forces into the army and a reform of the election oversight commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c3dee47e-350c-11e4-aa47-00144feabdc0.html|title=Subscribe to read|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/09/mozambique-government-renamo-sign-truce-201495111325375814.html|title=Mozambique rivals sign peace deal|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after RENAMO's refusal to accept the 2014 presidential elections, problems in the implementation of the peace deal and after continued efforts by government forces to disarm RENAMO met resistance, Dhlakama broke off the peace process in August 2015. Since then there have been renewed clashes between government and RENAMO forces. Dhlakama claims there have been two attempts by the government to assassinate him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Mozambique-forces-in-deadly-clashes-with-Renamo-police-20151103|title=Mozambique forces in deadly clashes with Renamo - police|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201512230076.html|title=Mozambique: Renamo Wants Zuma to Mediate|date=23 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017|via=AllAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 truce===
In May 2017, RENAMO agreed to extend their truce indefinitely.&lt;ref name="voanewsmozambiquerebelmovement"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mozambique Rebel Movement Renamo Extends Truce Indefinitely|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-rebel-movement-renamo-extends-truce-indefinitely/3838230.html|accessdate=May 5, 2017|work=Voice of America|date=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2017}}
Richard Douglas Lamm was born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] on August 3, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0FU9OUY2zAC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=richard+lamm+governor+born+1935&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MeDzm5oNTu&amp;sig=Mr1JRma6DtmrmBImNRqIpPIaGCw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC2MqbuILSAhVKxoMKHRUHAho4ChDoAQg0MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=richard+lamm+governor+born+1935&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Colorado|first=Nancy|last=Capace|date=January 1, 1999|publisher=Somerset Publishers, Inc.|accessdate=February 27, 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_colorado/col2-content/main-content-list/title_lamm_richard.default.html|title=Richard D. Lamm|first=|last=root|website=www.nga.org|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from high school in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and attended the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], where he majored in [[accounting]]. Lamm spent his college summers working as a [[lumberjack]] in [[Oregon]], a [[stockboy]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], and helping out on an ore boat. Lamm graduated from college in 1957, then served one year of active duty as a first lieutenant in the [[United States Army]] at [[Fort Carson]] in [[Colorado]] and [[Fort Eustis]] in [[Virginia]] until switching to reserve duty in 1958.

From 1958-1960 Lamm lived in [[Salt Lake City]], [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], and [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], holding jobs as an [[accountant]], tax clerk and a law clerk.&lt;ref&gt;Colorado River Water Users Association, [http://www.crwua.org/pdf/oralhistory/colorado/Richard%20Lamm.doc ''Richard Lamm''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020231107/http://crwua.org/pdf/oralhistory/colorado/Richard%20Lamm.doc |date=October 20, 2010 }}, MS Word document.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamm attended law school at the [[University of California]], graduated in 1961, then moved to [[Denver]] in 1962, where he worked as an accountant and then set up a law practice. Lamm took to the [[Colorado]] lifestyle, becoming an avid skier, mountain climber, hiker, and member of the [[Colorado Mountain Club]]. He joined the faculty of the [[University of Denver]] in 1969 and has been associated with the University ever since.

Since 1963 he has been married to [[Dottie Lamm]], a former airline flight attendant and newspaper columnist.&lt;ref&gt;Westword, [http://www.westword.com/1998-01-29/news/dottie-lamm/ ''Dottie Lamm, the better half''], accessed July 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 she won the Democratic nomination for the US Senate from Colorado, but lost in the general election to incumbent Republican [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post'', November 4, 1998, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/keyraces98/cosen/cosen.htm "Colorado senate"], accessed July 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamm was selected as one of [[Time Magazine]]'s "200 Young Leaders of America" in 1974, and won the [[Christian Science Monitor]] "Peace 2020" essay in 1985. In 1992, he was honored by the [[Denver Post]] and [[Historic Denver, Inc.]] as one of the "Colorado 100" - people who made significant contributions to Colorado and made lasting impressions on the state's history. Lamm was the recipient of the 1993 Humanist of the Year award from the [[American Humanist Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedartmouth.com/1995/07/05/news/summer|title=The Dartmouth  -  America's Oldest College Newspaper|publisher=|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Chairman of the [[Pew Health Professions Commission]] and a public member of the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]].

==Political activities==

===Colorado House of Representatives===
In 1964 he was elected to the [[Colorado House of Representatives]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from an affluent district near the [[University of Denver]]. In 1967, he drafted and succeeded in passing the nation's first liberalized [[abortion]] law.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Kopel, [https://archive.is/20120710030251/http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OWQ3ZWYzNTM5ZTg1NWJkMGVkN2M3MjFhMTVlMjMxYjY= "The corner]," ''National Review'', January 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was an early leader of the [[environmental movement]], and was President of the First National Conference on Population and the Environment.

In 1972, as a member of the [[Colorado General Assembly]], Lamm led the movement against [[Denver]]'s hosting of the [[1976 Winter Olympics]]. Denver had already been awarded the games, but the movement succeeded in cutting off public funding for the games, forcing the city to cancel its hosting. [[Innsbruck, Austria]] replaced Denver as the host.&lt;ref&gt;John Sanko, [http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/millennium/1012stone.shtml "Colorado only state ever to turn down olympics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601181029/http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/millennium/1012stone.shtml |date=June 1, 2009 }}, ''Rocky Mountain News''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lamm's successful effort made him known statewide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorado|url=http://www.iandrinstitute.org/Colorado.htm|website=Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute|publisher=University of Southern California|accessdate=December 26, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007052600/http://www.iandrinstitute.org/Colorado.htm|archivedate=October 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorado governor===
[[File:Richard D. Lamm Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|Official portrait in the Colorado State House]]
Lamm ran for [[Governor of Colorado]] in 1974 on a platform to limit growth, and was elected.  Reacting to the high cost of campaigning, he had walked the state in his campaign.

One of his acts as governor was designating musician [[John Denver]] as the Poet Laureate of Colorado.

As candidate and then governor, Lamm promised for environmental reasons to "drive a silver stake" through plans to build Interstate 470, a proposed circumferential highway around the southwest part of the [[Denver Metropolitan Area]].  However, continued development in the area led to increased congestion on surface streets, and the highway was later built, largely with state funds, as [[Colorado State Highway 470|State Highway 470]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Steers, [http://www.westword.com/1997-06-19/news/the-blacktop-jungle/ "The blacktop jungle,"] ''Westword'', June 19, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PBS, [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/blueprintamerica/reports/road-to-the-future/interview-governor-dick-lamm/617/ "Road to the future,"] May 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, his outspoken statements in support of [[physician-assisted suicide]] generated controversy, specifically over his use of the phrase "we have a duty to die."  Lamm later explained that he "was essentially raising a general statement about the human condition, not beating up on the elderly," and that the exact phrasing in the speech was "We've got a duty to die and get out of the way with all of our machines and artificial hearts and everything else like that and let the other society, our kids, build a reasonable life." &lt;ref&gt;New York ''Times'', [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9E01E5D91E39F93AA15750C0A962948260 "Gov. Lamm asserts elderly, if very ill, have 'duty to die'"], March 29, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  His dire predictions for the future of social security and health care ("duty to die") earned him the nickname "Governor Gloom".

Lamm was elected Colorado governor three times.  When he left office in 1987 after three terms and 12 years in the office, he was the longest-serving governor in state history (his successor, [[Roy Romer]], matched this record).

===Later political campaigns===
In 1990, state party leaders tried to get Lamm to run for the [[U.S. Senate]] seat being vacated by Sen. [[Tim Wirth]], also a Democrat, but Lamm declined.  In 1992 he ran for the U.S. Senate but suffered his first political defeat. [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]] beat him in the Democratic primary and went on to win the seat. (Nighthorse Campbell later switched to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].)

In 1996 Lamm, while noting that he was still a registered Democrat, criticized both his own [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the Republican Party, saying "I think both political parties are controlled by special interest money, and I've had enough of it." and "The Democrats are too close to the trial lawyers and the National Education Association. The Republicans are too close to the radical right."
&lt;ref&gt;[http://cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/news/9607/07/lamm/transcript.shtml Transcript of CNN's ''Inside Politics Weekend''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527075603/http://cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/news/9607/07/lamm/transcript.shtml |date=May 27, 2010 }}, July 7, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 1996, he formally announced his intention to run for the nomination of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] for the U.S. Presidency. Less than 48 hours after Lamm announced his candidacy, [[Ross Perot]], who built the Reform Party from his [[United We Stand America]] organization, said he would run as the Reform Party nominee if drafted. In early August, Lamm picked former California Republican congressman [[Ed Zschau]], a high-tech millionaire and proven fund-raiser, to be his running mate on the presidential ticket. Ultimately, however, Perot won 65.2 percent of the 49,266 votes cast by party members nationwide, Lamm winning just 34.8 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Toner, [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/18/us/reform-party-names-perot-its-presidential-candidate-49000-participated-in-vote.html "Reform Party names Perot its presidential candidate; 49,000 participate in vote,"] New York ''Times'', August 18, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writer and novelist==
{{BLP sources section|date=February 2009}}
In 1985, while still in the governor's office, he tried his hand as a novelist. The resulting novel, ''1988'', was a story about a former Democratic governor of Texas running for [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] on a [[populism|populist]], [[third political party|third-party]] ticket, declaring himself a "progressive conservative."  The main character bore a number of similarities to Lamm himself, in his stated political positions, his background as a Democratic governor, as well as presaging Lamm's own unsuccessful run for the Reform Party nomination in 1996.  However, the main character in ''1988'' was also portrayed as a pawn of an international conspiracy to capture the White House.

A voluminous writer, Lamm's other works include ''Population and the Law'' (1972), ''Some Reflections on the Balkanization of America'' (1978), ''Megatraumas: America at the Year 2000'' (1980),&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.amazon.com/Megatraumas-America-at-Year-2000/dp/0395379121 Megatraumas: America at the Year 2000 (Hardcover)]."

==Activities since leaving political office==
{{BLP sources section|date=February 2009}}
After leaving office, Lamm has continued to speak publicly on [[environmentalism|environmental]] mainly [[population control]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/news/five-reasons-not-to-miss-our-facebook-live-visit-with-ex-governor-dick-lamm-8019927|title=Five Reasons Not to Miss Our Facebook Live Visit With Ex-Governor Dick Lamm|first=Alan|last=Prendergast|date=June 20, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[immigration reduction]], and [[health care]] issues.

In 2004 Lamm unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the Board of Directors of the [[Sierra Club]].  He urged that the Sierra Club advocate immigration controls as a way to limit environmental degradation due to population growth.&lt;ref&gt;Felicity Barringer, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/16/us/bitter-division-for-sierra-club-on-immigration.html "Bitter division for Sierra Club on immigration]," ''New York Times'', March 16, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  During a 2011 interview, Lamm clarified that he believes "legal immigration has been good for America. The success of Silicon Valley shows we need entrepreneurial immigrants with skills to bring to our country!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://populistapproach.wordpress.com/2011/06/17/special-feature-dick-lamms-immigration-diet/|title=Protected Blog › Log in|website=populistapproach.wordpress.com|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamm serves as the Chairman of the Advisory Board of the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] (FAIR), and on the Board of Directors of the [[Diversity Alliance for a Sustainable America]] (DASA). He is {{As of|2004|alt=currently}} the Co-Director of the [[Institute for Public Policy Studies]] at the University of Denver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~montfell/biographies/g_n/lammr.html|title=The Montgomery Fellows -|website=www.dartmouth.edu|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He authored a book, ''The Brave New World of Health Care'', a criticism of current United States health care policies and proposals for reforming them. (Fulcrum Publishing, {{ISBN|1-55591-510-8}}) Lamm also served on the board of directors of American Water Development Inc, along with, among others, [[Maurice Strong]], [[Samuel Belzberg]], [[Alexander Crutchfield]] and [[William Ruckelshaus]].

In 2005, a 2004 speech by Lamm titled "I Have a Plan to Destroy America," became famous after being frequently forwarded as an email; in it he criticizes [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/lamm.asp Richard Lamm on Multiculturalism]." ''[[Snopes]]''. Retrieved on February 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he gave a controversial speech on the theme of his recently released book, ''Two Wands, One Nation'', advocating that black and Hispanic Americans embrace "Japanese or Jewish values".&lt;ref&gt;Google books, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cP5O--RB0OAC&amp;pg=PA1 ''Two Wands, One Nation''], accessed July 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The essay was widely criticized by Colorado community groups and leader of his own party.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Aguilera, [http://www.denverpost.com/ci_4105113?source=rss "Lamm's remarks stir anger,"], ''Denver Post'', July 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamm currently sits on the board of directors for the [[Energy Literacy Advocates]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

'''Sabia Dreptății''' ({{lang-en|The Sword of Justice}}) was one of the organized anti-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] groups in [[Bălți]], [[Bessarabia]]. 

== Overview==

Sabia Dreptății was initiated by students [[Petre Lungu]] and [[Ion Moraru]] from Bălți. This anti-Soviet armed resistance group was active in Bălți during the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] era. "Sabia Dreptății" was discovered by the [[NKVD]] in 1947, based at the Pedagogical Lycée (former Ion Creangă Lycée) in Bălți.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.presidency.ro/static/ordine/RAPORT_FINAL_CPADCR.pdf Comisia Prezidenţială pentru Analiza Dictaturii Comuniste din România: Raport Final] / ed.: Vladimir Tismăneanu, Dorin Dobrincu, Cristian Vasile, Bucureşti: Humanitas, 2007, 879 pp., {{ISBN|978-973-50-1836-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ion Moraru is well known anti-communist in Bessarabia. For one year, Ion Moraru was imprisoned in the same camp at [[Ekibastuz]] with [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanism.net/tag/sabia-dreptatii Organizatia anti-sovietica “Sabia Dreptatii”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809121325/http://romanism.ro/tag/sabia-dreptatii |date=2011-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">The '''Santebal''' (សន្តិបាល), a [[Khmer language|Khmer]] term meaning "keeper of the peace", was the Special Branch of the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]].

The Santebal was in charge of internal security and running prison camps like [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|Tuol Sleng]] (S-21) where thousands of people were imprisoned, tortured and killed. It was part of the Khmer Rouge organizational structure well before April 17, 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took control over Cambodia. The name is an amalgam of two words: ''santisuk'' meaning security and ''norkorbal'' meaning police.
==History==
As early as 1971, the Khmer Rouge established the Special Zone outside of [[Phnom Penh]] under the direction of [[Vorn Vet]] and [[Son Sen]]. Son Sen, later the Deputy Prime Minister for Defense of [[Democratic Kampuchea]], was also in charge of the Santebal, and in that capacity he appointed [[Comrade Duch]] to run its security apparatus. Most of the Santebal's deputies, such as [[Mam Nai|Comrade Chan]] and [[Tang Sin Hean|Comrade Pon]], hailed from [[Kampong Thom Province|Kampong Thom]], Duch's native province.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Kiernan]], ''The Pol Pot Regime: Race, Power and Genocide in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, 1975-1979''. Page 315&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Khmer Rouge took power in 1975, Duch moved his headquarters to Phnom Penh and reported directly to Son Sen. At that time, a small chapel in the capital was used to incarcerate the regime's prisoners, who totaled fewer than two hundred. In May 1976, Duch moved his headquarters to its final location, a former high school known as Tuol Sleng, which could hold up to 1,500 prisoners. It was at Tuol Sleng that the major purges of Khmer Rouge cadres took place and thousands of prisoners were tortured and killed. Between 1976 and 1978, 20,000 Cambodians were imprisoned at Tuol Sleng. Of this number only seven adults are known to have survived. Tuol Sleng, however, was only one of at least 150 execution centers in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Locard, Henri, [http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/cambodia/locard.pdf State Violence in Democratic Kampuchea (1975-1979) and Retribution (1979-2004)], ''European Review of History'', Vol. 12, No. 1, March 2005, pp.121–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stolypin agrarian reforms''' were a series of changes to [[Imperial Russia]]'s agricultural sector instituted during the tenure of [[Pyotr Stolypin]], Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister). Most, if not all, of these reforms were based on recommendations from a committee known as the "Needs of Agricultural Industry Special Conference," which was held in Russia between 1901–1903 during the tenure of Minister of Finance [[Sergei Witte]].

==Background to reforms==
{{See also|Russian peasants' uprising of 1905–06}}
The reforms aimed to transform the traditional ''[[obshchina]]'' form of Russian [[agriculture]], which bore some similarities to the [[open-field system]] of Britain. Serfs who had been liberated by the [[emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|emancipation reform of 1861]] lacked the financial ability to leave their new lands, as they owed money to the state for periods of up to 49 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= A History of Russia |edition= 6|author= Riasanovsky, Nicholas V.|date= 2000|page= 373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived drawbacks of the ''obshchina'' system included collective ownership, scattered land allotments based on family size, and a significant level of control by the family elder. Stolypin, as a staunch conservative, also sought to eliminate the commune system — known as the ''[[mir (commune)|mir]]'' — and to reduce radicalism among the peasants, thus preventing further political unrest such as that which occurred during the [[Revolution of 1905]]. Stolypin believed that tying the peasants to their own private land-holdings would produce profit-minded and politically conservative farmers like those living in parts of western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Thompson, John M.|title= A Vision Unfulfilled: Russia and the Soviet Union in the Twentieth Century|publisher= Lexington, MA: D.C. Heath and Company|date= 1996|pages= 83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stolypin referred to his own programs as a "wager on the strong and sober".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= A History of Russia (sixth edition)|author= Riasanovsky, Nicholas V.|date= 2000|page= 414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reforms began with and introduced the unconditional right of individual landownership ([[Ukase]] of November 9, 1906). Stolypin's reforms abolished the ''obshchina'' system and replaced it with a [[capitalism|capitalist]]-oriented form highlighting private ownership and consolidated modern farmsteads.

The multifaceted reforms introduced the following:
* development of large-scale individual farming (''[[khutor]]s'')
* introduction of [[agricultural cooperative]]s
* development of agricultural education
* dissemination of new methods of [[land improvement]]
* affordable lines of [[credit (finance)|credit]] for peasants

The state implemented the Stolypin agrarian reforms in a comprehensive campaign from 1906 through 1914. This system was not a [[command economy]] like that found in the Soviet Union in the 1920s, but rather a continuation of the modified [[state capitalism]] program begun under [[Sergei Witte]]. Stolypin's program differed from Witte's reforms not in the rapid push — which was a characteristic also found in the Witte reforms — but in the fact that Stolypin's reforms were to the agricultural sector, including improvements to the rights of individuals on a broad level and had the backing of the police. These reforms laid the groundwork for a market-based agricultural system for Russian peasants.

The principal ministers involved in the implementation of the Stolypin agrarian reforms included Stolypin himself as Interior Minister and Prime Minister, [[Alexander Krivoshein]] as [[Ministry of State Property|Agriculture and State Property Minister]], and [[Vladimir Kokovtsov]] as Finance Minister and Stolypin's successor as Prime Minister.

The Soviet agrarian program in the 1920s reversed the Stolypin reforms.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Colonization==
As a result of the expansion of the [[Trans-Siberian Railroad]] and other railroads east of the [[Ural Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea]], migration to [[Siberia]] increased. Thompson estimated that between 1890 and 1914 that over 10 million persons migrated freely from western Russia to areas east of the Urals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thompson, John M.|title=A Vision Unfulfilled: Russia and the Soviet Union in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Lexington, MA: D.C. Heath and Company|date=1996|pages=83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was encouraged by the Trans-Siberian Railroad Committee, which was personally headed by [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]]. The Stolypin agrarian reforms included resettlement benefits for peasants who moved to Siberia. An emigration department was created in 1906 at the ministry of agriculture. It organized resettlement and assisted the settlers during their first years in the new settlements. The settlers received on average 16.5 hectares of land per man. The total area allocated was 21 million hectares. Migrants received a small state subsidy, exemption from some taxes, and advice from state agencies specifically developed to help with peasant resettlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Russia (sixth edition)|author=Riasanovsky, Nicholas V.|date=2000|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part thanks to these initiatives, approximately 2.8 million of the 10 million migrants to Siberia relocated between 1908 and 1913. This increased the population of the regions east of the Urals by 2.5 times before the outbreak of [[World War I]].

==Cooperative initiatives==
A number of new types of [[Cooperative#Agricultural cooperative|cooperative assistance]] were developed as part of the Stolypin agrarian reforms, including financial-credit cooperation, production cooperation, and consumer cooperation. Many elements of Stolypin's cooperation-assistance programs were later incorporated into the early agrarian programs of the [[Soviet Union]], reflecting the lasting influence of Stolypin.

'''The Open Communication Universities Debating Network''' ({{lang-sr|Отворена комуникација }}/ {{lang|sr-Latn|Otvorena komunikacija}}) was founded in 1997 in [[Belgrade]]. Founded by both professors and students, it was established as an organization which promotes civic discourse, non-violent communication, critical thinking, argumentative presentation of ideas, public speaking as a form of free speech and the use of parliamentary debate as an educational and promotional tool.

== Working with students ==

Preserving the same goals, Open Communication has been working in three University centers ([[University of Belgrade|Belgrade]], [[University of Novi Sad|Novi Sad]], [[University of Niš|Niš]]) and now has more than 150 active members out of over 850 students that passed its parliamentary debate training program. It currently encompasses 5 debate clubs, among which the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Belgrade Law School]] Debate Club was formed first in 1997. The Club has been functioning since its foundation even during the times when its activities were banned. During that period the Law School Debate Club organized its activities as part of the Alternative Academic Network and Belgrade Open School. However, since the democratic changes in Serbia in 2000, the Law School Debate Club has continuously received generous financial and institutional support from the School of Law.

== International recognition ==

Open Communication is a recognized member of International Debate Education Association (IDEA) and the Serbian representative in the European Universities Debating Council, currently holding the office of Vice President, and it successfully cooperates with numerous international, regional and local organizations through international tournaments and seminars.

== Goals ==

The primary goals and activities of this organization include: 
* promoting debate through faculty-based clubs;
* organizing seminars, debate tournaments and debate academies;
* organizing expert lectures, panel discussions and public debates;
* pursuing all forms of tolerant, rational and open communication to promote it as political and educational means, as well as a powerful tool for civil initiative and action.

Organizing public debates has been one of the priorities of Open Communication for the last several years. Raising public awareness is one of the crucial aims of our organization, as well as educating students and the society as a whole that peaceful communication through arguments is more efficient, more creative and will bring them closer to their goals.

== Regional activities ==

Open Communication is also active in promoting debating around the region. Trainers who are members of the network have held workshops in [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Republic of Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]] over the past year.

'''''Tiocfaidh ár lá''''' ({{IPA-ga|ˈtʲʊki aːɾˠ ˈl̪ˠaː}}) is an [[Irish language]] phrase which translates as "our day will come", referring to a potential future [[united Ireland]].

==Origins==
[[File:James Joyce in 1915.jpg|alt=Joyce playing a guitar|thumb|Although Irish author James Joyce (pictured 1915) used the English-language phrase "our day will come", he applied it to the struggles of the Irish for sovereignty.]]
The literal English phrase "our day will come" has been used in various contexts. In the context of Irish literature, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'', features the nationalist Michael Davin (based on [[George Clancy (politician)|George Clancy]]) saying Irish freedom fighters "died for their ideals, [[Stephen Dedalus|Stevie]]. Our day will come yet, believe me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Joyce|first=James |title=A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man |year=1916 |chapter=Ch. 5 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man/Chapter_5 |accessdate=3 April 2009}} "[[Our Day Will Come]]" is also a pop song about love from 1963 hit by [[Ruby &amp; the Romantics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish phrase ''tiocfaidh ár lá'' is attributed to Provisional IRA prisoner [[Bobby Sands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toolis |first=Kevin |title=Rebel Hearts: Journeys within the IRA's soul |publisher=[[Picador (imprint)|Picador]] |year=2000 |page=412 |isbn=0-330-34648-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ireland: Space, Text, Time |editor1=Liam Harte |editor2=Yvonne Whelan |editor3=Patrick Crotty |publisher=Liffey Press|year=2005 |page=110 |isbn=1-904148-83-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shanahan |first=Timothy |title=The Provisional Irish Republican Army and the Morality of Terrorism |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]] |year=2009 |page=46 |isbn=0-7486-3530-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coogan |first=Tim Pat |authorlink=Tim Pat Coogan |title=The IRA |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |year=2002 |edition=revised |page=499 |isbn=0-312-29416-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; who uses it in several writings smuggled out of the [[Maze Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sands |first=Bobby |authorlink=Bobby Sands |others=foreword by [[Gerry Adams]] |title=Bobby Sands: Writings from Prison |publisher=Mercier Press |year=1998 |isbn=1-85635-220-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the last sentence of ''One Day in my Life'', the diary he kept of the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|1981 hunger strike]] in which he died, published in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=Breifne |date=November 1983 |title=Theology and Hope in Northern Ireland |journal=The Furrow |volume=34 |issue=11 |pages=698–702: 698 |jstor=27677735 |subscription=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kearney |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Kearney |title=Transitions: narratives in modern Irish culture |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1988 |pages=224–5 |isbn=0-7190-1926-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diarmait Mac Giolla Chríost antedates this to a pamphlet published {{circa}} 1975–77 by [[Gerry Adams]] of his experiences in the Maze.&lt;ref name="jailtacht2012p52"/&gt; Many republicans learned Irish in prison (a phenomenon known as "Jailtacht", a pun on [[Gaeltacht]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mac Giolla Chríost |first=Diarmait |year=2007 |title=The Origins of 'the Jailtacht' |journal=Proceedings of the Harvard Celtic Colloquium |volume=27 |pages=317–336 |jstor=40732064}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conversed regularly with each other through Irish, both for cultural reasons and to keep secrets from the wardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jarman |first=Neil |title=Material conflicts: parades and visual displays in Northern Ireland |publisher=Berg |year=1997 |pages=242–3 |isbn=1-85973-129-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gaelic revival|Irish language revival movement]] has often overlapped with [[Irish nationalism]], particularly [[Irish language in Northern Ireland|in Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tanner |first=Marcus |title=The last of the Celts |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2006 |page=123 |isbn=0-300-11535-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Reilly |first=Camille C |title=Minority Languages in the European Union |editor=Camille C O'Reilly |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |year=2001 |edition=5th |pages=83–96 |chapter=Irish language, Irish identity: Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the European Union |isbn=0-333-92925-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nic Craith |first=Máiréad |title=Plural identities—singular narratives: the case of Northern Ireland |publisher=Berghahn |year=2002 |pages=150–1 |isbn=1-57181-314-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tiocfaidh ár lá'' has been called "the [[battle cry]] of the [[blanketmen]]".&lt;ref name="jailtacht2012p63"&gt;Mac Giolla Chríost 2012 p.63&lt;/ref&gt; The upsurge in republican consciousness in the wake of the hunger strikes also increased awareness of the Irish language in republican areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Tony |title=Wars of Words: The Politics of Language in Ireland 1537–2004 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2005 |page=195 |isbn=0-19-927343-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gearóid Mac Lochlainn, a Belfast-born Irish-language poet, uses the phrase in a 2002 poem, 'Ag Siopadóireacht' ("Shopping"), characterised by Mac Giolla Chríost as "the voice of [[youthful rebellion]], ... of [[hip-hop]]".&lt;ref name="jailtacht2012p79"&gt;Mac Giolla Chríost 2012 p.79&lt;/ref&gt; In Mac Lochlainn's own English translation of his poem, ''Tiocfaidh ár lá'' is left untranslated.&lt;ref name="jailtacht2012p79" /&gt;

''Tiocfaidh Ár Lá'' (TÁL) is the name of a [[fanzine]] for [[Celtic F.C.]]'s Irish republican [[ultras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jarvie |first=Grant |title=Scottish Sport in the Making of the Nation: Ninety Minute Patriots? |author2=Graham Walker |publisher=Leicester University Press |year=1994 |page=184 |isbn=0-7185-1454-8}}

The 2007 arrest of Irish-language activist [[Máire Nic an Bhaird]] in Belfast was allegedly in part for saying "tiocfaidh ár lá" to [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] officers, although she claimed to have said "tiocfaidh bhur lá" ("your day will come").&lt;ref name="convicted"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/?jp=CWSNSNQLCWSN |title=Irish language teacher in Belfast guilty of disorderly behaviour |date=26 February 2007  |accessdate=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the [[employment tribunal|Fair Employment Tribunal]] awarded damages to a Catholic employee who had been dismissed after taking sick leave in response to a Protestant manager shouting "Tiocfaidh ár lá" at her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/woman-awarded-20-000-after-tiocfaidh-%C3%A1r-l%C3%A1-shouted-at-her-1.3268337 |title=Woman awarded £20,000 after ‘tiocfaidh ár lá’ shouted at her |date=25 October 2017 |work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4157">The '''Tomlinson Report''' was a 1954 study commissioned by the [[South African]] government into the economic viability of the 'reserves' (later the [[bantustan]]s) into which the government intended to confine the black population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Afrikaners: Biography of a People|last=Giliomee|first=Hermann|publisher=Hurst|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of South Africa|last=Beck|first=Roger B.|publisher=Greenwood|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=133–134|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houghton|first=D.

==Creation and composition==
In 1950, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government, then under [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] [[Daniel François Malan|D. F. Malan]], set up a commission to devise "a comprehensive scheme for the rehabilitation of the Native Areas with a view to developing within them a social structure in keeping with the culture of the Native and based upon effective socio-economic planning".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was by chaired by Professor Frederick R. Tomlinson, who was assisted by a panel comprising mostly members of the [[South African Bureau for Racial Affairs]] (SABRA), a conservative [[think tank]] at [[Stellenbosch University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The most important contributors to the Report, besides Tomlinson, were Nic Olivier and Jan Sadie.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:HF Verwoerd Transvaler.jpg|thumb|[[Hendrik Verwoerd]], who as [[Minister of Native Affairs (South Africa)|Minister of Native Affairs]] was critical of the Tomlinson Report and did not implement most of its proposals.|282x282px]]

==Report==
The Tomlinson Report was presented to the government in October 1954 and ran, in its unabridged form, to 3,755 pages in 18 volumes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It concluded that if the reserves were to support the growing black population the government would need to invest at least £104 million over the following decade. Land additional to that set aside in the [[Native Trust and Land Act, 1936|1936 Land Act]] would need to be purchased and annexed to the reserves, and the state would need to develop industries in and near the reserves to create an additional 300,000 jobs. Even then, the Report said, the reserves would be able to accommodate only two-thirds of South Africa's projected black population by the year 2000. The Report also concluded that the traditional 'tribal' systems of authority used by the government to rule the reserves were not suitable for a modern industrial state.

==Reception==
The report was strongly criticised by [[Hendrik Verwoerd]], then [[Minister of Native Affairs]] and staunch backer of 'total apartheid', since it cast doubt on the viability of a crucial plank of that scheme.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He refused to implement almost all of its proposals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; But it was also criticised by organisations like the [[African National Congress]] for its conservative founding assumption that the way forward for South Africa was to make the reserves capable of supporting total racial segregation, rather than to move towards integration and equal [[civil rights]] within a united South Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some have said that the Report was a turning point in South African history, which would have been dramatically different if Verwoerd had accepted the Report.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; But others have pointed out that the Report's recommendations, even by its own lights, would have been insufficient to make the reserves viable; and moreover the black population grew much faster than the commission had predicted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''victimless crime''' is an illegal act that typically either directly involves only the perpetrator or occurs between [[consent]]ing adults; because it is consensual in nature, there is arguably no true victim. Examples of these types of crimes include possession of illegal [[contraband]] and atypical sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary|date=2004|publisher=West Publishing Company|location=St. Paul, MN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, current victimless crimes include [[recreational drug use]], while some also include [[prostitution]]. However, there is controversy surrounding this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is Prostitution a Victimless Crime?|url = http://crime.about.com/od/prostitution/a/prostitution.htm|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwin Schur and [[Hugo Adam Bedau]] state in their book ''Victimless Crimes: Two Sides of a Controversy'' that "some of these laws produce secondary crime, and all create new 'criminals,' many of whom are otherwise law-abiding citizens and people in authority."

In politics, a lobbyist or an activist might use this phrase with the implication that the law in question should be abolished.&lt;ref name="SchurEdwin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schur |first=Edwin |title=Victimless Crimes: Two Sides of a Controversy |year=1973 |publisher=The New York Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victimless crimes are, in the [[harm principle]] of [[John Stuart Mill]], "victimless" from a position that considers the individual as the sole [[wikt:sovereign|sovereign]], to the exclusion of more abstract bodies such as a community or a [[State (polity)|state]] against which criminal offenses may be directed.&lt;ref&gt;"The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign." {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qCQCAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=on+liberty&amp;pg=PP1&amp;q=On+Liberty#PPA21,M1 |author=John Stuart Mill|title=On Liberty|publisher=Oxford University|year=1859|pages=21–22|accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Three characteristics can be used to identify whether a crime is victimless crime – if the act is excessive, is indicative of a distinct pattern of behavior, and its adverse effects impact only the person who has engaged in it – according to the University of Chicago's vice scholar, Jim Leitzel.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, B. T. (2015). Strictly Taboo: Cultural Anthropology's Insights into Mass Incarceration and Victimless Crime. New England Journal On Criminal &amp; Civil Confinement, 41(1), 49-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, each [[polity]] determines for itself the laws it wants to have, so as to maximize the happiness of its citizens. As knowledge progresses and behavior changes, and values change as well, laws in most countries lag badly behind social changes. Once it is obvious to a vast majority that the law is unnecessary at best, the law, until it is repealed, will be prohibiting a victimless crime.

Many victimless crimes begin because of a desire to obtain illegal products or services that are in high demand. Criminal penalties thus tend to limit the supply more than the demand, driving up the black-market price and creating monopoly profits for those criminals who remain in business. This "crime tariff" encourages the growth of sophisticated and well-organized criminal groups. Organized crime in turn tends to diversify into other areas of crime. Large profits provide ample funds for bribery of public officials, as well as capital for diversification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frase|first=Richard|title=Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Victimless_Crime.aspx#1-1G2:3403000270-full|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[War on Drugs]] is a commonly cited example of prosecution of victimless crime. The reasoning behind this is that drug use does not directly harm other people. It is argued that the criminalization of drugs leads to highly inflated prices for drugs. For example, Bedau and Schur found in 1974 that "In England the pharmacy cost of heroin [was] 0.06 cents per grain. In the United States street price [was] $30-90 per grain." This inflation in price is believed to drive addicts to commit crimes such as theft and robbery, which are thought to be inherently damaging to society, in order to be able to purchase the drugs on which they are dependent.

In addition to the creation of a [[black market]] for drugs, the War on Drugs is argued by proponents of legalization to reduce the workforce by damaging the ability of those convicted to find work. It is reasoned that this reduction of the workforce is ultimately harmful to an economy reliant on labor. The number of drug arrests increases every year. In a poll taken by the Bureau of Justice Statistics between 1980 and 2009, "[over a] 30-year period...[arrest] rates for drug possession or use doubled for whites and tripled for blacks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Snyder|first=Howard|title=Arrests in The United States|url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=2203|publisher=Office of Justice Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legalization of victimless acts==
Many activities that were once considered crimes are no longer illegal in some countries, at least in part because of their status as victimless crimes.

Two large categories of victimless crimes are sexual pleasure and recreational drug use (drug pleasure). On the first, 
*Homosexuality was legalized in [[Russia]] after the 1917 [[Bolshevik Revolution]], led by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merrick|first1=Jeffrey|title=Homosexual Desire in Revolutionary Russia: The Regulation of Sexual and Gender Dissent (review)|journal=Journal of Social History|date=2003|volume=36 | issue = 4 |pages=1089–1091}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legalization occurred when the Bolsheviks decriminalized consensual sodomy by omitting it from their list of illegal sexual acts in the 1922 Bolshevik legal code, likely because they wanted to simplify their dealings with sexual crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Healey|first1=Dan|title=Homosexual desire in revolutionary Russia, public and hidden transcripts, 1917-1941|date=1998|pages=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]] later persecuted the existence of homosexuality under his regime by undermining Bolshevik law, though the exact extent of his ruthlessness and policing of those with same-sex attraction is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Healey|first1=Dan|title=Homosexual Existence and Existing Socialism: New Light on the Repression of Male Homosexuality in Stalin's Russia.|journal=GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies|date=2002|volume=8 | issue = 3 |pages=349–378|doi=10.1215/10642684-8-3-349}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the UK in the 1950s, the [[Wolfenden report]] recommended the legalization of "homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private", for these reasons.
*Almost fifty years later, ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' struck down U.S. [[sodomy law]]s. As of 2015, [[Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act|sale of sex toys remains illegal in Alabama]].

Marijuana use is forbidden by law in [[Australia]] but is the most “widely used illicit drug” in the country, just as it is in countries such as the [[United States]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=W.|title=The recent Australian debate about the prohibition on cannabis use.|journal=Addiction|date=1997|volume=92 | issue = 9 |pages=1109–1115|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1997.tb03668.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition of alcohol]] in the United States, repealed in 1933, is considered a failed "social experiment" because many citizens ignored what it stipulated, turning to home-made spirits in lieu of licensed alcoholic drinks and resultantly making problems worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Wayne|title=What are the policy lessons of National Alcohol Prohibition in the United States, 1920–1933?|journal=Addiction|date=2010|volume=105 | issue = 7 |pages=1164–1173|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.02926.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States today, tension over marijuana legalization is in response the current marijuana prohibition in most states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Routh|first1=Matthew J.|title=Re-thinking liberty: Cannabis prohibition and substantive due process|journal=The Kansas Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy|date=2017|volume=26 | issue = 2 |pages=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are efforts to legalize cannabis in many countries such as the United States and Australia, as its legalization has the potential to greatly increase revenue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mcginty, Niederdeppe, Heley, &amp; Barry|title=Public perceptions of arguments supporting and opposing recreational marijuana legalization|journal=Preventive Medicine|date=2017|volume=99|pages=80–86|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2017.01.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Legality of prostitution|Prostitution is legal in many countries, though usually restricted]]. The Netherlands legalized prostitution in 1999, and was one of the first countries to do so. As of 2012, however, it has been considering policy changes to severely restrict it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Outshoorn|first1=Joyce|title=Policy Change in Prostitution in the Netherlands: From Legalization to Strict Control.|journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy|date=2012|volume=9 | issue = 3 |pages=233–243|doi=10.1007/s13178-012-0088-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adultery]] (sexual acts between a married person and a person other than the spouse) and [[fornication]] (sexual acts between unmarried people) have not been prosecuted in the United States for over 50 years, although the laws against them, like those against [[sodomy]], are still on the books in several states. However, because sodomy laws were struck down as unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', the laws against fornication would also be unconstitutional as was recognized by the [[Supreme Court of Virginia]] in ''[[Martin v. Ziherl]]''.

==Controversy==
The degradation of societal moral standards is a major concern among those who oppose the legalization of victimless crime. However, punishing citizens solely for their choice to engage in victimless, immoral acts is a difficult task. While the United States' typical response to crimes is retroactive, the illegality of victimless crimes is a more preventative approach to justice and is highly controversial.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Stuart P.|title=Vice Crimes and Preventive Justice|journal=Criminal Law and Philosophy|date=10 October 2013|volume=9|issue=3|pages=561–576|doi=10.1007/s11572-013-9260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversies over victimless crime deal mostly with the question of whether a crime can ever actually be victimless. With relation to drugs and their pathway to consumption, the impact of the drug trade and liability laws on drug dealers, their families, and other unforeseen actors may end in victimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reiter|first1=Nicholas|title=Dollars for victims of a "victimless" crime: A defense of drug dealer liability acts|journal=Journal of Law and Policy|date=2007|volume=15 | issue = 3 |pages=1329–1374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possession of both adult and child pornography is also often considered to be a victimless crime, but the victimization that adults and children often undergo during its production is typically unacknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Audrey|title=Child Pornography's Forgotten Victims|journal=Pace Law Review|date=2008|volume=28|pages=847–885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the argument that legal powers must be restrained to allow citizen autonomy, free from impediments in making voluntary, victimless choices that may or may not be perceived as morally wrong, also exists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the incorporation of preventative law, such as sex offender registries and anti-social behavior orders, comes a loss of distinction between criminal and civil law because victimless crime is typically difficult to categorize and criminalize. This is problematic because it causes a distortion of traditional procedures found within the criminal and civil of aspects of United States law by enabling confusion and procedural interchangeability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Young Kashgar Party''' was a [[Pan-Turkism|Turkic Nationalist]] [[Uyghur people|Uighur]] party which existed in 1933-1934. It helped found the [[First East Turkestan Republic]]. It was anti [[Han chinese|Chinese]] and anti [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]]. The uighur military leader [[Timur Beg]] and the [[Khotan]] [[Emir]]s [[Muhammad Amin Bughra]], [[Abdullah Bughra]], and [[Nur Ahmad Jan Bughra]] formed an alliance with the Young Kashgar Party. It convened a parliament of 40 members, and sent two delegates to [[Khoja Niyaz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=young+kashgar+party&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pHQiTPDFL8SAlAfLufWPBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=young%20kashgar%20party%20turkic%20nationalist%20ykp%20uighurs%20anti&amp;f=false|title=Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911-1949|author=Andrew D.

'''Zionism''' ({{lang-he-n|צִיּוֹנוּת}} ''Tsiyyonut'' {{IPA-he|t͡sijo̞ˈnut|}} after ''[[Zion]]'') is the [[Ethnic nationalism|national]] movement of the [[Jewish people]] that supports the re-establishment of a [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish homeland]] in the territory defined as the historic [[Land of Israel]] (roughly corresponding to [[Canaan]], the [[Holy Land]], or the region of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]).{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=604.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herzl |first1=Theodor |authorlink1=Theodor Herzl |translator= Sylvie d'Avigdor |title=Der Judenstaat |trans-title=The Jewish state |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3f4RFWkMeWoC |accessdate=September 28, 2010 |edition=republication |year=1988 |origyear=1896 |publisher=[[Dover Publications|Courier Dover]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-486-25849-2 |page=40 |chapter=Biography, by Alex Bein |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=3f4RFWkMeWoC&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/zionism|title=Zionism |work=Oxford Dictionary |access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zionism|title=Zionism {{!}} nationalistic movement|access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Zionism emerged in the late 19th century in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] as a national revival movement, both in reaction to newer waves of [[antisemitism]] and as an imitative response to other nationalist movements.&lt;ref name="Shillony2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben-Ami Shillony|authorlink=Ben-Ami Shillony|title=Jews &amp; the Japanese: The Successful Outsiders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OvzPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88|date=January 24, 2012|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-1-4629-0396-2|page=88|quote='(Zionism) arose in response to and in imitation of the current national movements of Central, Southern, and Eastern Europe.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeVineMossberg2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=LeVine |first1=Mark |last2=Mossberg|first2=Mathias|title=One Land, Two States: Israel and Palestine as Parallel States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnVAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211|year=2014|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-95840-1|page=211|quote=The parents of Zionism were not Judaism and tradition, but antiSemitism and nationalism. The ideals of the [[French Revolution]] spread slowly across [[Europe]], finally reaching the [[Pale of Settlement]] in the [[Russian Empire]] and helping to set off the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. This engendered a permanent split in the Jewish world, between those who held to a halachic or religious-centric vision of their identity and those who adopted in part the racial rhetoric of the time and made the Jewish people into a nation. This was helped along by the wave of [[pogrom]]s in Eastern Europe that set two million Jews to flight; most wound up in [[United States|America]], but some chose Palestine. A driving force behind this was the [[Hovevei Zion]] movement, which worked from 1882 to develop a Hebrew identity that was distinct from [[Judaism]] as a religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gelvin2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gelvin |first=James L.|title=The Israel-Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDaZAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93|date=January 13, 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-47077-4|page=93|quote=The fact that [[Palestinian nationalism]] developed later than Zionism and indeed in response to it does not in any way diminish the legitimacy of Palestinian nationalism or make it less valid than Zionism. All nationalisms arise in opposition to some "other". Why else would there be the need to specify who you are? And all nationalisms are defined by what they oppose. As we have seen, Zionism itself arose in reaction to anti-Semitic and exclusionary nationalist movements in Europe. It would be perverse to judge Zionism as somehow less valid than European anti-Semitism or those nationalisms. Furthermore, Zionism itself was also defined by its opposition to the indigenous Palestinian inhabitants of the region. Both the "conquest of land" and the "conquest of labor" slogans that became central to the dominant strain of Zionism in the Yishuv originated as a result of the Zionist confrontation with the Palestinian "other".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after this, most leaders of the movement associated the main goal with creating the desired state in Palestine, then an area controlled by the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name=RCohen&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Robin|title=The Cambridge Survey of World Migration|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=504|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbzsBPuhyggC&amp;lpg=PA405&amp;dq=Zionism%20Colonize%20palestine&amp;pg=PA405#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JGelvin&gt;{{cite book|last=Gelvin|first=James|title=The Israel–Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War|year=2007|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521888352|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5FwAT5fx03IC&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=the%20Basel%20program%20colonisation%20of%20Palestine&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ilan Pappe, ''The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine'', 2006, p.10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1948, the primary goals of Zionism were the re-establishment of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel, [[gathering of Israel|ingathering of the exiles]], and liberation of Jews from the antisemitic discrimination and [[Persecution of Jews|persecution]] that they experienced during their [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]]. Since the establishment of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948, Zionism continues primarily to advocate on behalf of Israel and to address threats to its continued existence and security.

A religious variety of Zionism supports Jews upholding their Jewish identity defined as adherence to religious Judaism, opposes the assimilation of Jews into other societies, and has advocated the [[Aliyah|return]] of Jews to [[Israel]] as a means for Jews to be a majority nation in their own state.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=604.}} A variety of Zionism, called [[cultural Zionism]], founded and represented most prominently by [[Ahad Ha'am]], fostered a [[secular]] vision of a Jewish "spiritual center" in Israel. Unlike Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, Ahad Ha'am strived for Israel to be "a Jewish state and not merely a state of Jews".&lt;ref&gt;Ahad Ha'am, ''The Jewish State and Jewish Problem'', trans. from the Hebrew by Leon Simon c 1912, Jewish Publication Society of America, Essential Texts of Zionism [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/haam2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "Zionism" is derived from the word Zion ({{lang-he|ציון}} ,''Tzi-yon''), referring to [[Jerusalem]]. Throughout eastern Europe in the late 19th century, numerous grassroots groups were promoting the national resettlement of the Jews in their homeland, as well as the revitalization and cultivation of the Hebrew language. These groups were collectively called the "[[Lovers of Zion]]" and were seen to encounter a growing Jewish movement toward assimilation. The first use of the term is attributed to the Austrian [[Nathan Birnbaum]], founder of the ''Kadimah'' nationalist Jewish students' movement; he used the term in 1890 in his journal ''Selbstemanzipation!'' (''Self-Emancipation''),&lt;ref&gt;De Lange, Nicholas, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D7qPcsAFPvkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=An%20Introduction%20to%20Judaism%2C%20Cambridge%20University%20Press%20(2000)&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q=Birnbaum&amp;f=false ''An Introduction to Judaism''], Cambridge University Press (2000), p. 30. {{ISBN|0-521-46624-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; itself named almost identically to [[Leon Pinsker]]'s 1882 book ''[[Auto-Emancipation]]''.

==Overview==
{{Main|Types of Zionism}}
[[File:Israel_-_Location_Map_(2012)_-_ISR_-_UNOCHA.svg|thumb|The modern state of Israel, the end goal of the Zionist movement.]]
The common denominator among all Zionists is the claim to [[Land of Israel|Eretz Israel]] as the national homeland of the Jews and as the legitimate focus for Jewish national self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Shimoni, ''The Zionist Ideology'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on historical ties and [[Judaism|religious traditions]] linking the Jewish people to the [[Land of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aviel Roshwald]], "Jewish Identity and the Paradox of Nationalism", in [[Michael Berkowitz]], (ed.). ''Nationalism, Zionism and Ethnic Mobilization of the Jews in 1900 and Beyond'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Zionism does not have a uniform ideology, but has evolved in a dialogue among a plethora of ideologies: General Zionism, [[Religious Zionism]], [[Labor Zionism]], [[Revisionist Zionism]], [[Green Zionism]], etc.

After almost two millennia of the [[Jewish diaspora]] residing in various countries without a national state, the Zionist movement was founded in the late 19th century by [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jews]], largely as a response by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] to rising antisemitism in [[Europe]], exemplified by the [[Dreyfus affair]] in [[France]] and the [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Wylen, Stephen M. ''Settings of Silver: An Introduction to Judaism'', Second Edition, Paulist Press, 2000, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; The political movement was formally established by the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] journalist [[Theodor Herzl]] in 1897 following the publication of his book ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' (''The Jewish State'').&lt;ref&gt;Walter Laqueur, ''The History of Zionism'' (2003) p 40&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the movement sought to encourage Jewish migration to [[Ottoman Palestine]].

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote= "I believe that a wondrous generation of Jews will spring into existence. The Maccabeans will rise again. Let me repeat once more my opening words: The Jews who wish for a State will have it. We shall live at last as free men on our own soil, and die peacefully in our own homes. The world will be freed by our liberty, enriched by our wealth, magnified by our greatness. And whatever we attempt there to accomplish for our own welfare, will react powerfully and beneficially for the good of humanity."|source=Theodore Herzl, concluding words of ''The Jewish State'', 1896&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish State'', by Theodore Herzl, (Courier Corporation, 27 Apr 2012), page 157&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Although initially one of several Jewish political movements offering alternative responses to [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] and antisemitism, Zionism expanded rapidly. In its early stages, supporters considered setting up a Jewish state in the historic territory of Palestine. After [[World War II]] and the destruction of Jewish life in Central and Eastern Europe where these alternative movements were rooted, it became dominant in the thinking about a Jewish national state.

Creating an alliance with [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and securing support for some years for Jewish emigration to Palestine, Zionists also recruited European Jews to immigrate there, especially Jews who lived in areas of the Russian Empire where anti-semitism was raging. The alliance with Britain was strained as the latter realized the implications of the Jewish movement for Arabs in Palestine, but the Zionists persisted. The movement was eventually successful in establishing Israel on May 14, 1948 (5 Iyyar 5708 in the [[Hebrew calendar]]), as the [[homeland for the Jewish people]]. The proportion of the world's Jews living in Israel has steadily grown since the movement emerged. By the early 21st century, more than 40% of the [[Jewish population|world's Jews]] lived in Israel, more than in any other country. These two outcomes represent the historical success of Zionism, and are unmatched by any other Jewish political movement in the past 2,000 years. In some academic studies, Zionism has been analyzed both within the larger context of [[diaspora politics]] and as an example of modern [[Wars of national liberation|national liberation movements]].&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Taylor, "Vision and intent in Zionist Thought", in ''The Transformation of Palestine'', ed. by I. Abu-Lughod, 1971, {{ISBN|0-8101-0345-1}}, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Zionism also sought assimilation of Jews into the modern world. As a result of the diaspora, many of the Jewish people remained outsiders within their adopted countries and became detached from modern ideas. So-called "assimilationist" Jews desired complete integration into European society. They were willing to downplay their Jewish identity and in some cases to abandon traditional views and opinions in an attempt at modernization and assimilation into the modern world. A less extreme form of assimilation was called cultural synthesis. Those in favor of cultural synthesis desired continuity and only moderate evolution, and were concerned that Jews should not lose their identity as a people. "Cultural synthesists" emphasized both a need to maintain traditional Jewish values and faith, and a need to conform to a modernist society, for instance, in complying with work days and rules.&lt;ref&gt;Tesler, Mark. ''Jewish History and the Emergence of Modern Political Zionism.'' Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Printing Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed [[Resolution 3379]], which designated Zionism as "a form of racism and racial discrimination". The resolution was repealed in 1991 by replacing Resolution 3379 with [[United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_3379#Revocation|Resolution 46/86]]. Opposition to Zionism in principle has also sometimes been called racist and has been characterized as fostering the segregation of peoples that should seek peaceful coexistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/columnists/90023/why-anti-zionists-are-racists | title = Why anti-Zionists are racists | work= Jewish Chronicle | date=November 8, 2012|  accessdate= June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/opinion/article/formula_could_combat_campus_racism_20050610 | title = Formula Could Combat Campus Racism | work= Jewish Weekly | date=June 5, 2005|  accessdate= June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zionism was established with the political goal of creating a Jewish state in order to create a nation where Jews could be the majority, rather than the minority which they were in a variety of nations in the diaspora. [[Theodor Herzl]], the ideological father of Zionism, considered [[Antisemitism]] to be an eternal feature of all societies in which Jews lived as minorities, and that only a separation could allow Jews to escape [[Persecution of Jews|eternal persecution]]. "Let them give us sovereignty over a piece of the Earth's surface, just sufficient for the needs of our people, then we will do the rest!" he proclaimed exposing his plan.&lt;ref name="Herzl_Judenstaat"/&gt; {{rp|p.27 (29)}}

Herzl proposed two possible destinations to colonize, Argentina and Palestine.

Aliyah (migration, literally "ascent") to the Land of Israel is a recurring theme in Jewish prayers. [[Negation of the Diaspora|Rejection of life in the Diaspora]] is a central assumption in Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;E. Schweid, "Rejection of the Diaspora in Zionist Thought", in ''Essential Papers on Zionism'', ed. By Reinharz &amp; Shapira, 1996, {{ISBN|0-8147-7449-0}}, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of Zionism believed that Jews in the Diaspora were prevented from their full growth in Jewish individual and national life.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Zionists generally preferred to speak Hebrew, a [[Semitic language]] that developed under conditions of freedom in ancient [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], and worked to modernize and adapt it for everyday use. Zionists sometimes refused to speak [[Yiddish]], a language they thought had developed in the context of [[Antisemitism in Europe|European persecution]]. Once they moved to Israel, many Zionists refused to speak their (diasporic) mother tongues and adopted new, Hebrew names. Hebrew was preferred not only for ideological reasons, but also because it allowed all citizens of the new state to have a common language, thus furthering the political and cultural bonds among Zionists.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Major aspects of the Zionist idea are represented in the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]]:

{{Quote|The Land of Israel was the birthplace of the Jewish people. Here their spiritual, religious and political identity was shaped. Here they first attained to statehood, created cultural values of national and universal significance and gave to the world the eternal Book of Books.

After being forcibly exiled from their land, the people kept faith with it throughout their Dispersion and never ceased to pray and hope for their return to it and for the restoration in it of their political freedom.

Impelled by this historic and traditional attachment, Jews strove in every successive generation to re-establish themselves in their ancient homeland. In recent decades they returned in their masses.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris, J.

Since the first centuries of the [[Common Era|CE]], most Jews have lived outside the Land of Israel (Eretz Israel, better known as Palestine), although there has been a constant minority presence of Jews. According to [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], Eretz Israel is a land promised to the Jews by God according to the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew]] and Greek [[Bible]]s and the [[Quran]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/ted_hildebrandt/otesources/01-genesis/text/articles-books/kaiser_promisedland_bsac.pdf|title=The Promised Land: A Biblical-Historical View|website=gordon.edu|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lifting the Veil: The True Faces of Muhammad &amp; Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_MZrBQSivBYC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=quran+promised+land&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi88ZKEob7LAhWFd5oKHSNoBbgQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=quran%20promised%20land&amp;f=false|quote=the Quran affirms the Biblical narrative that assigned the Promised Land to the [[Twelve tribes of Israel]] on BOTH sides of the [[Jordan River|river Jordan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]] began in 586 BCE during the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian occupation of Israel]]. The Babylonians destroyed the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]], which was central to Jewish culture at the time. After the 1st century [[First Jewish–Roman War|Great Revolt]] and the 2nd century [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], the [[Roman Empire]] expelled the Jews from [[Judea]], changing the name to ''Syria Palaestina.'' The Bar Kokhba revolt caused a spike in [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] and Jewish persecution. The ensuing exile from Judea greatly increased the percent of Jews who were dispersed throughout the Diaspora instead of living in their original home.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the 17th century [[Sabbatai Zevi]] (1626–1676) announced himself as the Messiah and gained many Jews to his side, forming a base in Salonika. He first tried to establish a settlement in Gaza, but moved later to [[Smyrna]]. After deposing the old rabbi [[Aaron Lapapa]] in the spring of 1666, the Jewish community of [[Avignon]], France prepared to emigrate to the new kingdom. The readiness of the Jews of the time to believe the messianic claims of Sabbatai Zevi may be largely explained by the desperate state of Central European Jewry in the mid-17th century. The bloody pogroms of [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] had wiped out one-third of the Jewish population and destroyed many centers of Jewish learning and communal life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'', Shabbethai Zebi, http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=531&amp;letter=S&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, a current in Judaism supporting a [[return to Zion]] grew in popularity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/churchhistory/0,15478,3900-1,00.html#FlashPluginDetected "Church History"], LDS Official website&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in Europe, where antisemitism and hostility toward Jews were growing. The idea of returning to Palestine was rejected by the conferences of rabbis held in that epoch. Individual efforts supported the emigration of groups of Jews to Palestine, [[Aliyah#Pre-Zionist Aliyah|pre-Zionist Aliyah]], even before [[First Zionist Congress|1897]], the year considered as the start of practical Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;C.D. Smith, 2001, ''Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict'', 4th ed., {{ISBN|0-312-20828-6}}, p. 1–12, 33–38&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reformed Jews rejected this idea of a return to Zion. The conference of rabbis, at [[Frankfurt am Main]], July 15–28, 1845, deleted from the ritual all prayers for a return to Zion and a restoration of a Jewish state. The Philadelphia Conference, 1869, followed the lead of the German rabbis and decreed that the Messianic hope of Israel is "the union of all the children of God in the confession of the unity of God". The Pittsburgh Conference, 1885, reiterated this Messianic idea of reformed Judaism, expressing in a resolution that "we consider ourselves no longer a nation, but a religious community; and we therefore expect neither a return to Palestine, nor a sacrificial worship under the sons of Aaron, nor the restoration of any of the laws concerning a Jewish state".&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia,'' "Zionism," http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=132&amp;letter=Z&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish settlements were established in the upper Mississippi region by W.D. Robinson in 1819. Others were developed near [[Jerusalem]] in 1850, by the American Consul [[Warder Cresson]], a convert to Judaism. Cresson was tried and condemned for lunacy in a suit filed by his wife and son. They asserted that only a lunatic would convert to Judaism from Christianity. After a second trial, based on the centrality of American 'freedom of faith' issues and antisemitism, Cresson won the bitterly contested suit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishmag.com/93mag/usa-warder/usa-warder.htm], ''Jewish Mag''&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to Ottoman Palestine and established an agricultural colony in the [[Valley of Rephaim]] of Jerusalem. He hoped to "prevent any attempts being made to take advantage of the necessities of our poor brethren&amp;nbsp;... (that would)&amp;nbsp;... FORCE them into a pretended conversion."&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Virtual Library, "Warder Cresson," https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Cresson.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral but not practical efforts were made in [[Prague]] to organize a Jewish emigration, by [[Abraham Benisch]] and [[Moritz Steinschneider]] in 1835. In the United States, [[Mordecai Manuel Noah|Mordecai Noah]] attempted to establish a Jewish refuge opposite [[Buffalo, New York]] on Grand Isle, 1825.

Sir [[Moses Montefiore]], famous for his intervention in favor of Jews around the world, including the attempt to rescue [[Edgardo Mortara]], established a colony for Jews in Palestine. In 1854, his friend [[Judah Touro]] bequeathed money to fund Jewish residential settlement in Palestine. Montefiore was appointed executor of his will, and used the funds for a variety of projects, including building in 1860 the first Jewish residential settlement and almshouse outside of the old walled city of Jerusalem—today known as ''[[Mishkenot Sha'ananim]].'' [[Laurence Oliphant (author)|Laurence Oliphant]] failed in a like attempt to bring to Palestine the Jewish proletariat of Poland, Lithuania, Romania, and the Turkish Empire (1879 and 1882).

The official beginning of the construction of the [[New Yishuv]] in Palestine is usually dated to the arrival of the [[Bilu]] group in 1882, who commenced the [[First Aliyah]]. In the following years, Jewish immigration to Palestine started in earnest. Most [[Jewish refugees|immigrants]] came from the Russian Empire, escaping the frequent [[pogrom]]s and state-led persecution in what are now Ukraine and Poland. They founded a number of agricultural settlements with financial support from Jewish philanthropists in Western Europe. Additional Aliyahs followed the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] and its eruption of violent pogroms, as well as the Nazi persecution of the 1930s. At the end of the 19th century, Jews were a small minority in Palestine.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the 1890s, [[Theodor Herzl]] infused Zionism with a new ideology and practical urgency, leading to the [[First Zionist Congress]] at [[Basel]] in 1897, which created the World Zionist Organization (WZO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fusion.dalmatech.com/%7Eadmin24/files/zionism_in-britishpalestine.pdf Zionism &amp; The British In Palestine]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127070858/http://fusion.dalmatech.com/~admin24/files/zionism_in-britishpalestine.pdf |date=November 27, 2007 }}, by [[Arjun Charan Sethi|Sethi, Arjun]] (University of Maryland) January 2007, accessed May 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Herzl's [[First Zionist Congress#Basel program|aim]] was to initiate necessary preparatory steps for the development of a Jewish state. Herzl's attempts to reach a political agreement with the Ottoman rulers of Palestine were unsuccessful and he sought the support of other governments. The WZO supported small-scale settlement in Palestine; it focused on strengthening Jewish feeling and consciousness and on building a worldwide federation.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[Russian Empire]], with its long record of state-organized genocide and ethnic cleansing ("pogroms"), was widely regarded as the historic enemy of the Jewish people. The Zionist movement's headquarters were located in Berlin, as many of its leaders were German Jews who spoke German. Given Russia's anti-semitism, at the start of World War I, most Jews (and Zionists) supported Germany in its war with Russia.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Territories considered===

Throughout the first decade of the Zionist movement, there were several instances where Zionist figures supported a Jewish state in places outside Palestine, such as [[Uganda Scheme|Uganda]] and [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="Rovner2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Rovner|title=In the Shadow of Zion: Promised Lands Before Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ej_UBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|date=December 12, 2014|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-1-4798-1748-1|page=45|quote=European Jews swayed and prayed for Zion for nearly two millennia, and by the end of the nineteenth century their descendants had transformed liturgical longing into a political movement to create a Jewish national entity somewhere in the world.

It took nearly a decade for Zionism to exdusively concentrate its spiritual yearning on the spatial coordinates of Ottoman Palestine.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Theodor Herzl]], the founder of political Zionism was initially content with any Jewish self-governed state.&lt;ref name="AvivShneer2005a"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Caryn S.

In 1903, British Colonial Secretary [[Joseph Chamberlain]] offered Herzl 5,000 square miles in the [[Uganda Protectorate]] for Jewish settlement.&lt;ref name="PasachoffLittman2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Naomi E.

Some groups felt that accepting the scheme would make it more difficult to establish a Jewish state in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], the African land was described as an "[[Antechamber|ante-chamber]] to the Holy Land". It was decided to send a commission to investigate the proposed land by 295 to 177 votes, with 132 abstaining. The following year, congress sent a delegation to inspect the plateau. A temperate climate due to its high elevation, was thought to be suitable for European settlement. However, the area was populated by a large number of [[Maasai people|Maasai]], who did not seem to favour an influx of Europeans. Furthermore, the delegation found it to be filled with [[lion]]s and other animals.

After Herzl died in 1904, the Congress decided on the fourth day of its seventh session in July 1905 to decline the British offer and, according to Adam Rovner, "direct all future settlement efforts solely to Palestine".&lt;ref name="PasachoffLittman2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rovner2014n2"/&gt; [[Israel Zangwill]]'s [[Jewish Territorialist Organization]] aimed for a Jewish state anywhere, having been established in 1903 in response to the Uganda Scheme, was supported by a number of the Congress's delegates. Following the vote, which had been proposed by [[Max Nordau]], Zangwill charged Nordau that he “will be charged before the bar of history,” and his supporters blamed the Russian voting bloc of [[Menachem Ussishkin]] for the outcome of the vote.&lt;ref name="Rovner2014n2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Rovner|title=In the Shadow of Zion: Promised Lands Before Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ej_UBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|date=December 12, 2014|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-1-4798-1748-1|page=81|quote=On the afternoon of the fourth day of the Congress a weary Nordau brought three resolutions before the delegates: (1) that the Zionist Organization direct all future settlement efforts solely to Palestine; (2) that the Zionist Organization thank the British government for its other of an autonomous territory in East Africa; and (3) that only those Jews who declare their allegiance to the Basel Program may become members of the Zionist Organization." Zangwill objected… When Nordau insisted on the Congress’s right to pass the resolutions regardless, Zangwill was outraged. “You will be charged before the bar of history,” he challenged Nordau… From approximately 1:30 p.m. on Sunday, July 30, 1905, a Zionist would henceforth he defined as someone who adhered to the Basel Program and the only “authentic interpretation” of that program restricted settlement activity exclusively to Palestine. Zangwill and his supporters could not accept Nordau’s “authentic interpretation" which they believed would lead to an abandonment of the Jewish masses and of Herzl’s vision. One territorialist claimed that Ussishkin’s voting bloc had in fact “buried political Zionism”.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobbying by Russian Jewish immigrant [[Chaim Weizmann]] together with fear that [[American Jews]] would encourage the USA to support Germany in the war against communist Russia, culminated in the British government's [[Balfour Declaration]] of 1917. &lt;!--Explain - how was this a result?--&gt;

It endorsed the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, as follows:

{{quote|The Mandate will secure the establishment of the Jewish national home ... and the development of self-governing institutions, and also safeguard the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine, irrespective of race and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateofisrael.com/mandate|title=League of Nations Palestine Mandate: July 24, 1922|website=www.stateofisrael.com|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Weizmann's role in obtaining the Balfour Declaration led to his election as the Zionist movement's leader. He remained in that role until 1948, and then was elected as the first [[President of Israel]] after the nation gained independence.

A number of high-level representatives of the international Jewish women's community participated in the [[First World Congress of Jewish Women]], which was held in [[Vienna]], Austria, in May 1923. One of the main resolutions was: "It appears ... to be the duty of all Jews to co-operate in the social-economic reconstruction of Palestine and to assist in the settlement of Jews in that country."&lt;ref name=jwa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/international-council-of-jewish-women|title=International Council of Jewish Women|author=Las, Nelly|publisher=International Council of Jewish Women|accessdate=20 November 2018 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish migration to Palestine and widespread Jewish land purchases from feudal{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} landlords contributed to landlessness among Palestinian Arabs, fueling unrest. Riots erupted in Palestine in [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|1920]], [[Jaffa riots|1921]] and [[1929 Palestine riots|1929]], in which both Jews and Arabs were killed.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/middle_east/03/v3_ip_timeline/html/1929_36.stm |title=Arab discontent |publisher=BBC |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain was responsible for the Palestinian mandate and, after the Balfour Declaration, it supported Jewish immigration in principle. But, in response to the violent events noted above, the [[Peel Commission]] published a report proposing new provisions and restrictions in Palestine.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 1927, [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Judaism|Jew]] [[Yitzhak Lamdan]], wrote an [[epic poem]] titled ''Masada'' to reflect the plight of the Jews, calling for a "last stand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamdan|first1=Yitzhak|title=Masada|date=1927|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the German adoption of the [[swastika]], [[Theodore N.

This has given birth to the [[conspiracy theory]] that [[Holocaust denial|Jews started the holocaust]], although the Nazi Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] was largely responsible for ignoring the patriotic Jew, and for instead promoting anti-German materials as "evidence" that the Jews needed to be eradicated.

===Rise of Hitler===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
In 1933, [[Hitler]] came to power in Germany, and in 1935 the [[Nuremberg Laws]] made [[German Jews]] (and later [[Anschluss|Austrian]] and [[Czech Jews]]) stateless refugees. Similar rules were applied by the many [[Axis powers|Nazi allies]] in Europe. The subsequent growth in Jewish migration and the impact of [[Nazi propaganda]] aimed at the Arab world led to the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]]. Britain established the Peel Commission to investigate the situation. The commission did not consider the situation of Jews in Europe, but called for a two-state solution and compulsory [[Population transfer|transfer of populations]]. Britain rejected this solution and instead implemented the [[White Paper of 1939]]. This planned to end Jewish immigration by 1944 and to allow no more than 75,000 additional Jewish migrants. This was disastrous to European Jews already being gravely discriminated against and in need of a place to seek refuge. The British maintained this policy until the end of the Mandate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The growth of the Jewish community in Palestine and the devastation of European Jewish life sidelined the World Zionist Organization. The Jewish Agency for Palestine under the leadership of [[David Ben-Gurion]] increasingly dictated policy with support from American Zionists who provided funding and influence in Washington, D.C., including via the highly effective [[American Palestine Committee]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

During [[World War II]], as the horrors of [[the Holocaust]] became known, the Zionist leadership formulated the [[One Million Plan]], a reduction from Ben-Gurion's previous target of two million immigrants. Following the end of the war, a massive wave of [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|stateless Jews]], mainly [[Holocaust survivors]], began [[Aliyah Bet|migrating to Palestine]] in small boats in defiance of British rules. The Holocaust united much of the rest of world Jewry behind the Zionist project.&lt;ref name=miracle&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Paul|title=The Miracle|journal=Commentary|date=May 1998|volume=105|pages=21–28|accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British either [[Cyprus internment camps|imprisoned these Jews in Cyprus]] or [[sS Exodus|sent them]] to the British-controlled [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany]]. The British, having faced the 1936–1939 Arab revolt against mass Jewish immigration into Palestine, were now facing opposition by [[British–Zionist conflict|Zionist groups in Palestine]] for subsequent restrictions. In January 1946 the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry was a joint [[United Kingdom–United States relations|British and American]] committee set up to examine the political, economic and social conditions in Palestine as they bore upon the problem of Jewish immigration and settlement and the well-being of the peoples living there; to consult representatives of Arabs and Jews, and to make other recommendations 'as necessary' for ad interim handling of these problems as well as for their eventual solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/angpre.asp Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry - Preface].

With the German invasion of Russia in 1941, Stalin reversed his long-standing opposition to Zionism, and tried to mobilize worldwide Jewish support for the Soviet war effort.  A  Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee was set up in Moscow. Many thousands of Jewish refugees fled the Nazis and entered the Soviet Union during the war, where they reinvigorated Jewish religious activities and opened new synagogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hiroaki Kuromiya|title=Stalin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRV4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1947 Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister [[Andrei Gromyko]] told the United Nations that the USSR supported the partition of Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state.

On May 14, 1948, at the end of the British mandate, the Jewish Agency, led by [[David Ben-Gurion]], declared the creation of the State of Israel, and the same day the armies of seven Arab countries invaded Israel.

[[File:Op Magic Carpet (Yemenites).jpg|thumb|Yemenite Jews on their way to Israel during [[Operation Magic Carpet]]]]
Since the creation of the State of Israel, the World Zionist Organization has functioned mainly as an organization dedicated to assisting and encouraging Jews to migrate to Israel. It has provided political support for Israel in other countries but plays little role in internal Israeli politics. The movement's major success since 1948 was in providing logistical support for migrating Jews and, most importantly, in assisting [[Soviet Jews]] in their struggle with the authorities over the right to leave the [[USSR]] and to practice their religion in freedom, and the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands|exodus of 850,000 Jews]] from the Arab world, mostly to Israel. In 1944–45, Ben-Gurion described the [[One Million Plan]] to foreign officials as being the "primary goal and top priority of the Zionist movement."{{sfn|Hacohen|1991|p=262 #2|ps=:"In meetings with foreign officials at the end of 1944 and during 1945, Ben-Gurion cited the plan to enable one million refugees to enter Palestine immediately as the primary goal and top priority of the Zionist movement.}} The immigration restrictions of the British White Paper of 1939 meant that such a plan could not be put into large scale effect until the Israeli Declaration of Independence in May 1948. The new country's immigration policy had some opposition within the new Israeli government, such as those who argued that there was "no justification for organizing large-scale emigration among Jews whose lives were not in danger, particularly when the desire and motivation were not their own"{{sfn|Hakohen|2003|p=46|ps=: "After independence, the government presented the Knesset with a plan to double the Jewish population within four years. This meant bringing in 600,000 immigrants in a four-year period. or 150,000 per year. Absorbing 150,000 newcomers annually under the trying conditions facing the new state was a heavy burden indeed. Opponents in the Jewish Agency and the government of mass immigration argued that there was no justification for organizing large-scale emigration among Jews whose lives were not in danger, particularly when the desire and motivation were not their own."}} as well as those who argued that the absorption process caused "undue hardship".{{sfn|Hakohen|2003|p=246–247|ps=: "Both the immigrants' dependence and the circumstances of their arrival shaped the attitude of the host society. The great wave of immigration in 1948 did not occur spontaneously: it was the result of a clear-cut foreign policy decision that taxed the country financially and necessitated a major organizational effort. Many absorption activists, Jewish Agency executives, and government officials opposed unlimited, nonselective immigration; they favored a gradual process geared to the country's absorptive capacity. Throughout this period, two charges resurfaced at every public debate: one, that the absorption process caused undue hardship; two, that Israel's immigration policy was misguided."}} However, the force of Ben-Gurion's influence and insistence ensured that his immigration policy was carried out.{{sfn|Hakohen|2003|p=47|ps=: "But as head of the government, entrusted with choosing the cabinet and steering its activities, Ben-Gurion had tremendous power over the country's social development. His prestige soared to new heights after the founding of the state and the impressive victory of the IDF in the War of Independence. As prime minister and minister of defense in Israel's first administration, as well as the uncontested leader of the country's largest political party, his opinions carried enormous weight. Thus, despite resistance from some of his cabinet members, he remained unflagging in his enthusiasm for unrestricted mass immigration and resolved to put this policy into effect."}}{{sfn|Hakohen|2003|p=247|ps=: "On several occasions, resolutions were passed to limit immigration from European and Arab countries alike. However, these limits were never put into practice, mainly due to the opposition of Ben-Gurion. As a driving force in the emergency of the state, Ben-Gurion—both prime minister and minister of defense—carried enormous weight with his veto. His insistence on the right of every Jew to immigrate proved victorious. He would not allow himself to be swayed by financial or other considerations. It was he who orchestrated the large-scale action that enabled the Jews to leave Eastern Europe and Islamic countries, and it was he who effectively forged Israel's foreign policy. Through a series of clandestine activities carried out overseas by the Foreign Office, the Jewish Agency, the Mossad le-Aliyah, and the Joint Distribution Committee, the road was paved for mass immigration."}}

The multi-national, worldwide Zionist [[Philosophical movement|movement]] is structured on [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] principles. Congresses are held every four years (they were held every two years before the Second World War) and delegates to the congress are elected by the membership. Members are required to pay dues known as a ''shekel''. At the congress, delegates elect a 30-man executive council, which in turn elects the movement's leader. The movement was democratic from its inception and women had the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Living Without a Constitution: Civil Rights in Israel|last=Sharfman |first=Dafnah |date=1993 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOrHFmiQy6kC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;d&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LzJxz5RbFA&amp;sig=uKe6YPolMzwelcBNNK52ii_Os8o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AAdTVf3UIeL-7AbPnYGgDQ&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCTgo#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20voting&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1917, the [[World Zionist Organization]] pursued a strategy of building a [[Jewish National Home]] through persistent small-scale immigration and the founding of such bodies as the [[Jewish National Fund]] (1901&amp;nbsp;– a charity that bought land for Jewish settlement) and the [[Anglo-Palestine Bank]] (1903&amp;nbsp;– provided loans for Jewish businesses and farmers). In 1942, at the [[Biltmore Conference]], the movement included for the first time an express objective of the establishment of a Jewish state in the Land of Israel.&lt;ref name="ajcarchives.org"&gt;''American Jewish Year Book'' Vol. 45 (1943–1944) [http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1943_1944_5_USCivicPolitical.pdf Pro-Palestine and Zionist Activities, pp 206-214]&lt;/ref&gt;

Labor Zionism originated in Eastern Europe. Socialist Zionists believed that centuries of oppression in antisemitic societies had reduced Jews to a meek, vulnerable, despairing existence that invited further antisemitism, a view originally stipulated by Theodor Herzl. They argued that a revolution of the Jewish soul and society was necessary and achievable in part by Jews moving to Israel and becoming farmers, workers, and soldiers in a country of their own. Most socialist Zionists rejected the observance of traditional religious Judaism as perpetuating a "Diaspora mentality" among the Jewish people, and established rural communes in Israel called "[[kibbutz]]im". The kibbutz began as a variation on a "national farm" scheme, a form of cooperative agriculture where the Jewish National Fund hired Jewish workers under trained supervision. The kibbutzim were a symbol of the Second Aliyah in that they put great emphasis on communalism and egalitarianism, representing to a certain extent Utopian socialism. Furthermore, they stressed self-sufficiency, which became an important aspect of Labor Zionism. Though socialist Zionism draws its inspiration and is philosophically founded on the fundamental values and spirituality of Judaism, its progressive expression of that Judaism has often fostered an antagonistic relationship with [[Orthodox Judaism]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Labor Zionism became the dominant force in the political and economic life of the [[Yishuv]] during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] and was the dominant ideology of the political establishment in Israel until the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 election]] when the [[Israeli Labor Party]] was defeated. The Israeli Labor Party continues the tradition, although the most popular party in the kibbutzim is [[Meretz]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, ''Israel: A History'' (London 1997), pp.594–607&lt;/ref&gt; Labour Zionism's main institution is the [[Histadrut]] (general organisation of labor unions), which began by providing strikebreakers against a Palestinian worker's strike in 1920 and until 1970s was the largest employer in Israel after the Israeli government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Guy Mundlak|title=Fading Corporatism: Israel's Labor Law and Industrial Relations in Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhxJ4DX4rEsC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dr&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cXNGFdGssM&amp;sig=uMkeHoiWSimlIWgf2j3LHK8-KpY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NzhTVcGxDInXUeeOgdAF&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%20second%20largest%20employer&amp;f=false|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=44|isbn=978-0-8014-4600-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mishmar HaEmek.JPG|thumb|Kibbutznikiyot (female Kibbutz members) in [[Mishmar HaEmek]], during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. The [[Kibbutz]] is the historical heartland of Labor Zionism.]]
General Zionism (or Liberal Zionism) was initially the dominant trend within the Zionist movement from the First Zionist Congress in 1897 until after the First World War. General Zionists identified with the liberal European middle class to which many Zionist leaders such as Herzl and [[Chaim Weizmann]] aspired. Liberal Zionism, although not associated with any single party in modern Israel, remains a strong trend in Israeli politics advocating free market principles, democracy and adherence to human rights. [[Kadima]], the main centrist party during the 2000s that is now defunct, however, did identify with many of the fundamental policies of Liberal Zionist ideology, advocating among other things the need for Palestinian statehood in order to form a more democratic society in Israel, affirming the free market, and calling for equal rights for Arab citizens of Israel. In 2013, [[Ari Shavit]] suggested that the success of the then-new [[Yesh Atid]] party (representing secular, middle-class interests) embodied the success of "the new General Zionists."&lt;ref&gt;Ari Shavit, [http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/the-dramatic-headline-of-this-election-israel-is-not-right-wing.premium-1.496021 The dramatic headline of this election: Israel is not right wing] ''Haaretz'' (January 24, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dror Zeigerman]] writes that the traditional positions of the General Zionists—"liberal positions based on social justice, on law and order, on pluralism in matters of State and Religion, and on moderation and flexibility in the domain of foreign policy and security"—are still favored by important circles and currents within certain active political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fnst-jerusalem.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/dror_book.pdf |title=A Liberal Upheaval: From the General Zionists to the Liberal Party (pre-book dissertation) |author=Dror Zeigerman |publisher=Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Liberty |date=2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402102632/http://www.fnst-jerusalem.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/dror_book.pdf |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Carlo Strenger]] describes a modern-day version of Liberal Zionism (supporting his vision of "Knowledge-Nation Israel"), rooted in the original ideology of Herzl and [[Ahad Ha'am]], that stands in contrast to both the [[romantic nationalism]] of the right and the ''Netzah Yisrael'' of the ultra-Orthodox. It is marked by a concern for democratic values and human rights, freedom to criticize government policies without accusations of disloyalty, and rejection of excessive religious influence in public life.

===Revisionist Zionism===
{{Main|Revisionist Zionism}}
[[File:Zeev Jabotinsky.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], founder of Revisionist Zionism]]
Revisionist Zionists, led by [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], developed what became known as Nationalist Zionism, whose guiding principles were outlined in the 1923 essay ''[[Iron Wall (essay)|Iron Wall]]''. In 1935 the Revisionists left the World Zionist Organization because it refused to state that the creation of a Jewish state was an objective of Zionism.

Jabotinsky believed that, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Zionism is a colonising adventure and it therefore stands or falls by the question of armed force. It is important to build, it is important to speak Hebrew, but, unfortunately, it is even more important to be able to shoot—or else I am through with playing at colonization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lenni Brenner]], ''The Iron Wall: Zionist Revisionism from Jabotinsky to Shamir'', Zed Books 1984, pp.74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]], ''Original Sins: Reflections on the History of Zionism and Israel'', Olive Branch Press, 1993 p.103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and that
&lt;blockquote&gt;Although the Jews originated in the East, they belonged to the West culturally, morally, and spiritually. Zionism was conceived by Jabotinsky not as the return of the Jews to their spiritual homeland but as an offshoot or implant of Western civilization in the East. This worldview translated into a geostrategic conception in which Zionism was to be permanently allied with European colonialism against all the Arabs in the eastern Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="shlaim"&gt;{{cite web|author=Avi Shlaim |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/shlaim-wall.html |title=The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World since 1948 |publisher=New York Times |date=1999 |accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The revisionists advocated the formation of a Jewish Army in Palestine to force the Arab population to accept mass Jewish migration.

Supporters of Revisionist Zionism developed the [[Likud]] Party in Israel, which has dominated most governments since 1977. It advocates Israel's maintaining control of the [[West Bank]], including [[East Jerusalem]], and takes a hard-line approach in the Arab–Israeli conflict. In 2005, the Likud split over the issue of creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories. Party members advocating peace talks helped form the Kadima Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Vause |author2=Guy Raz |author3=Shira Medding |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/11/21/israel.politics/ |title=Sharon shakes up Israeli politics |date=November 22, 2005 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Religious Zionism}}
Religious Zionism is an ideology that combines Zionism and observant [[Judaism]]. Before the establishment of [[Israel|the State of Israel]], Religious Zionists were mainly observant Jews who supported Zionist efforts to build a [[Jewish state]] in the [[Land of Israel]].

After the [[Six-Day War]] and the capture of the [[West Bank]], a territory referred to in Jewish terms as [[Judea and Samaria]], right-wing components of the Religious Zionist movement integrated nationalist revindication and evolved into [[Neo-Zionism]]. Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel and the Torah of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Kemp, ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314–315.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green Zionism===
{{Main|Green Zionism}}
Green Zionism is a branch of Zionism primarily concerned with the environment of Israel. The only environmental Zionist party is the [[Green Zionist Alliance]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Post-Zionism===
During the last quarter of the 20th century, classic nationalism in Israel declined. This led to the rise of [[post-Zionism]]. Post-Zionism asserts that Israel should abandon the concept of a "state of the Jewish people" and strive to be a state of all its citizens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/article/469 Can Israel Survive Post-Zionism?] by Meyrav Wurmser. ''Middle East Quarterly'', March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[One-state solution|binational state]] where Arabs and Jews live together while enjoying some type of autonomy.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Non-Jewish support==
Political support for the Jewish return to the Land of Israel predates the formal organization of Jewish Zionism as a political movement. In the 19th century, advocates of the [[restoration of the Jews to the Holy Land]] were called Restorationists. The return of the Jews to the Holy Land was widely supported by such eminent figures as [[Queen Victoria]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/herzl-hinted-at-napoleon-s-zionist-past-1.120723|title=Herzl Hinted at Napoleon's Zionist Past'|first=Amiram|last=Barkat|date=April 26, 2004|publisher=|accessdate=March 12, 2018|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[King Edward VII]], President [[John Adams]] of the United States, [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]] of South Africa, [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|President Masaryk]] of [[Czechoslovakia]], philosopher and historian [[Benedetto Croce]] from Italy, [[Henry Dunant]] (founder of the [[Red Cross]] and author of the [[Geneva Conventions]]), and scientist and humanitarian [[Fridtjof Nansen]] from [[Norway]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The French government, through Minister M. Cambon, formally committed itself to "...&amp;nbsp;the renaissance of the Jewish nationality in that Land from which the people of Israel were exiled so many centuries ago."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In China, top figures of the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist government]], including [[Sun Yat-sen]], expressed their sympathy with the aspirations of the Jewish people for a National Home.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Goldstein |first=Jonathan |year=1999 |contribution=The Republic of China and Israel |editor-last=Goldstein |editor-first=Jonathan |title=China and Israel, 1948–1998: A Fifty Year Retrospective |pages=1–39 |place=Westport, Conn. and London |publisher=Praeger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian Zionism===

[[File:Martin_Luther_King_Jr_NYWTS.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was a notable Christian supporter of Israel and Zionism.&lt;ref name=sundq /&gt;]]
Some Christians have actively supported the return of Jews to Palestine even prior to the rise of Zionism, as well as subsequently.  [[Anita Shapira]], a history professor emerita at Tel Aviv University, suggests that evangelical Christian restorationists of the 1840s 'passed this notion on to Jewish circles'.&lt;ref name="shapira"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Shapira | first = Anita | title = Israel a history | publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicolson| location = London | page = 15 | date = 2014 | isbn =9780297871583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelical Christian anticipation of and political lobbying within the UK for [[Christian Zionism in the United Kingdom|Restorationism]] was widespread in the 1820s and common beforehand.&lt;ref name= Lewis&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Donald | title = The Origins of Christian Zionism: Lord Shaftesbury And Evangelical Support For A Jewish Homeland | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = January 2, 2014 | location = Cambridge | page = 380 | isbn =9781107631960}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was common among the [[Puritan]]s to anticipate and frequently to pray for a Jewish return to their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Murray | first = Iain | title = the Puritan Hope | publisher = Banner of Truth | date = October 2014 | location = Edinburgh | page = 326 | isbn =9781848714786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cwi.org.uk/library/articles/HAPH.htm | title = The Puritan Hope and Jewish Evangelism | work= Herald Magazine, Christian Witness to Israel | date= 2015|  accessdate=June 29, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160629204443/http://www.cwi.org.uk/library/articles/HAPH.htm | archive-date= June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://americanvision.org/1715/john-macarthur-israel-calvinism-postmillennialism-part-2/ | title = John MacArthur, Israel, Calvinism, and Postmillennialism | work= American Vision | date=July 3, 2007|  accessdate=June 29, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160629204142/http://americanvision.org/1715/john-macarthur-israel-calvinism-postmillennialism-part-2/ | archive-date= June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the principal [[Protestantism|Protestant]] teachers who promoted the biblical doctrine that the Jews would return to their national homeland was [[John Nelson Darby]]. His doctrine of [[dispensationalism]] is credited with promoting Zionism, following his 11 lectures on the hopes of the church, the Jew and the [[gentile]] given in Geneva in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sizer | first = Stephen

November 17, 1839, after returning from a “Mission of Inquiry into the State of the
Jewish People”&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. C. Ryle|J C Ryle]]&lt;ref&gt;Sermon preached June 1864 to London Society for promoting Christianity among the Jews&lt;/ref&gt; were among a number of prominent proponents of both the importance and significance of a Jewish return, who were not dispensationalist. Pro-Zionist views were embraced by many [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]] and also affected international foreign policy.

The [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] ideologue [[Hippolytus Lutostansky]], also known as the author of multiple [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] tracts, insisted in 1911 that Russian Jews should be "helped" to move to Palestine "as their rightful place is in their former kingdom of Palestine".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Herman Bernstein|url = https://newspaperarchive.com/us/new-york/new-york/new-york-times/1911/08-27/page-42|title = Ritual murder libel encouraged by Russian court|last = |first = |date = August 27, 1911|work = New York Times|access-date = |via = |publication-date = August 27, 1911|quote = "Russia would make any sacrifice to help the Jews settle in Palestine and form an autonomous state of their own"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable early supporters of Zionism include British Prime Ministers [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Arthur Balfour]], American President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and British [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Orde Wingate]], whose activities in support of Zionism led the British Army to ban him from ever serving in Palestine. According to Charles Merkley of Carleton University, Christian Zionism strengthened significantly after the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, and many dispensationalist and non-dispensationalist evangelical Christians, especially Christians in the United States, now strongly support Zionism.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the last years of his life, the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], [[Joseph Smith]], declared, "the time for Jews to return to the land of Israel is now." In 1842, Smith sent [[Orson Hyde]], an Apostle of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], to Jerusalem to dedicate the land for the return of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/Jews/jewsch6.htm |title=Orson Hyde and Israel's Restoration |publisher=Signaturebookslibrary.org |accessdate=June 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707015147/http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/Jews/jewsch6.htm |archivedate=July 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Israel's creation in 1948, the [[Indian National Congress]] government opposed Zionism.

In 1945 US President [[Franklin D Roosevelt]] met with king [[Ibn Saud]] of Saudi Arabia. Ibn Saud pointed out that it was Germany who had committed crimes against the Jews and so Germany should be punished. Palestinian Arabs had done no harm to European Jews and did not deserve to be punished by losing their land. Roosevelt on return to the US concluded that Israel 'could only be established and maintained by force', and that it would have to be a 'land for Jews only'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexei Mikhailovich Vasiliev|Alexei Vasiliev]], ''A History of Saudi Arabia'', Saqi, chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic Church and Zionism===
{{Main|Holy See–Israel relations|Supersessionism#Roman Catholicism|Christianity and antisemitism}}
The initial response of the [[Catholic Church]] seemed to be one of strong opposition to Zionism. Shortly after the 1897 Basel Conference, the semi-official Vatican periodical (edited by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]) [[Civiltà Cattolica]] gave its biblical-theological judgement on political Zionism: "1827 years have passed since the prediction of Jesus of Nazareth was fulfilled&amp;nbsp;... that [after the destruction of Jerusalem] the Jews would be led away to be slaves among all the nations and that they would remain in the dispersion [diaspora, galut] until the end of the world." The Jews should not be permitted to return to Palestine with sovereignty: "According to the Sacred Scriptures, the Jewish people must always live dispersed and vagabondo [vagrant, wandering] among the other nations, so that they may render witness to Christ not only by the Scriptures&amp;nbsp;... but by their very existence".

Nonetheless, Theodore Herzl travelled to Rome in late January 1904, after the sixth Zionist Congress (August 1903) and six months before his death, looking for some kind of support. On January 22, Herzl first met the Papal Secretary of State, Cardinal [[Rafael Merry del Val]]. According to Herzl's private diary notes, the Cardinal's interpretation of the history of Israel was the same as that of the Catholic Church, but he also asked for the conversion of the Jews to Catholicism. Three days later, Herzl met Pope [[Pius X]], who replied to his request of support for a Jewish return to Israel in the same terms, saying that "we are unable to favor this movement. We cannot prevent the Jews from going to Jerusalem, but we could never sanction it&amp;nbsp;... The Jews have not recognized our Lord, therefore we cannot recognize the Jewish people."  In 1922, the same periodical published a piece by its Viennese correspondent, "anti-Semitism is nothing but the absolutely necessary and natural reaction to the Jews' arrogance... Catholic anti-Semitism - while never going beyond the moral law - adopts all necessary means to emancipate the Christian people from the abuse they suffer from their sworn enemy".&lt;ref name= Kertzer&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kertzer | first = David | title = Civiltà cattolica, 1922, IV, pp.369-71, cited in Unholy War | publisher = Pan Books | location = London | page = 273 | date = 2001 | isbn= 9780330390491}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initial attitude changed over the next 50 years, until 1997, when at the [[Holy See|Vatican]] symposium of that year, Pope [[John Paul II]] rejected the Christian roots of antisemitism, stating that "...&amp;nbsp;the wrong and unjust interpretations of the New Testament relating to the Jewish people and their supposed guilt [in Christ's death] circulated for too long, engendering sentiments of hostility toward this people."&lt;ref&gt;Rev.

===Characterization as colonialism or ethnic cleansing===
Zionism has been characterized as colonialism, and Zionism has been criticized for promoting unfair confiscation of land, involving the expulsion of, and causing violence towards, the Palestinians. The characterization of Zionism as colonialism has been described by, among others, [[Nur Masalha]], Gershon Shafir, [[Michael Prior (theologian)|Michael Prior]], [[Ilan Pappe]], and  [[Baruch Kimmerling]].&lt;ref name=CHARCOL&gt;

[[Isaac Deutscher]] has called Israelis the 'Prussians of the Middle East', who have achieved a 'totsieg', a 'victorious rush into the grave' as a result of dispossessing 1.5 million Palestinians. Israel had become the 'last remaining colonial power' of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tariq Ali]], ''The Clash of Fundamentalisms: Crusades, Jihad and Modernity'', Verso, 2003, p 124&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Said]] and [[Michael Prior (theologian)|Michael Prior]] claim that the notion of expelling the Palestinians was an early component of Zionism, citing Herzl's diary from 1895 which states "we shall endeavour to expel the poor population across the border unnoticed—the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly."&lt;ref&gt;

[[Ilan Pappe]] argued that Zionism results in ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilan Pappé|Pappe, Ilan]], ''The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine'', Oneworld, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This view diverges from other [[New Historians]], such as [[Benny Morris]], who accept the Palestinian exodus narrative but place it in the context of war, not ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;Rane, Halim.

[[Saleh Abdel Jawad]], [[Nur Masalha]], [[Michael Prior (theologian)|Michael Prior]], [[Ian Lustick]], and [[John Rose (Trotskyist)|John Rose]] have criticized Zionism for having been responsible for violence against Palestinians, such as the [[Deir Yassin massacre]], [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]], and [[Cave of the Patriarchs massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;

:".. the Zionist movement, which claims to be secular, found it necessary to embrace the idea of 'the promised land' of Old Testament prophecy, to justify the confiscation of land and the expulsion of the Palestinians. For example, the speeches and letter of Chaim Weizman, the secular Zionist leader, are filled with references to the biblical origins of the Jewish claim to Palestine, which he often mixes liberally with more pragmatic and nationalistic claims. By the use of this premise, embraced in 1937, Zionists alleged that the Palestinians were usurpers in the Promised Land, and therefore their expulsion and death was justified. The Jewish-American writer Dan Kurzman, in his book ''Genesis 1948'' … describes the view of one of the Deir Yassin's killers: 'The Sternists followed the instructions of the Bible more rigidly than others. They honored the passage (Exodus 22:2): 'If a thief be found …' This meant, of course, that killing a thief was not really murder. And were not the enemies of Zionism thieves, who wanted to steal from the Jews what God had granted them?'"

In 1938, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] rejected Zionism, saying that the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine is a religious act and therefore must not be performed by force, comparing it to the [[Partition of India]] into Hindu and Muslim countries. He wrote, "Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs&amp;nbsp;... Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home&amp;nbsp;... They can settle in Palestine only by the goodwill of the Arabs. They should seek to convert the Arab heart."&lt;ref&gt;William R. Slomanson.

Ha'am wrote that the Zionists "behave towards the Arabs with hostility and cruelty, trespass unjustly upon their boundaries, beat them shamefully without reason and even brag about it, and nobody stands to check this contemptible and dangerous tendency" and that they believed that "the only language that the Arabs understand is that of force."&lt;ref name=LRB&gt;{{cite journal|last=shlaim|first=Avi|title=It can be done|journal=[[London Review of Books]]|date=June 9, 1994|volume=16|issue=11|pages=26–27|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v16/n11/avi-shlaim/it-can-be-done|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some criticisms of Zionism claim that Judaism's notion of the "[[Jews as a chosen people|chosen people]]" is the source of racism in Zionism,&lt;ref&gt;

In 1975 the [[UN General Assembly]] passed Resolution 3379, which said "Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination". According to the resolution, "any doctrine of racial differentiation of superiority is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust, and dangerous." The resolution named the occupied territory of Palestine, Zimbabwe, and South Africa as examples of racist regimes.

Arab countries sought to associate Zionism with racism in connection with a [[World Conference against Racism 2001|2001 UN conference on racism]], which took place in [[Durban]], South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1484002.stm|title=Anger over Zionism debate|date=September 4, 2001|publisher=|accessdate=March 12, 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which caused the United States and Israel to walk away from the conference as a response. The final text of the conference did not connect Zionism with racism. A human rights forum arranged in connection with the conference, on the other hand, did equate Zionism with racism and censured Israel for what it called "racist crimes, including acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1523600.stm|title=US abandons racism summit|date=September 3, 2001|publisher=|accessdate=March 12, 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of Zionism, such as [[Chaim Herzog]], argue that the movement is non-discriminatory and contains no racist aspects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/UN/herzogsp.html Israeli Ambassador Chaim Herzog's Response To Zionism Is Racism Resolution. November 10, 1975.] "You dare talk of racism when I can point with pride to the Arab ministers who have served in my government; to the Arab deputy speaker of my Parliament; to Arab officers and men serving of their own volition in our border and police defense forces, frequently commanding Jewish troops; to the hundreds of thousands of Arabs from all over the Middle East crowding the cities of Israel every year; to the thousands of Arabs from all over the Middle East coming for medical treatment to Israel; to the peaceful coexistence which has developed; to the fact that Arabic is an official language in Israel on a par with Hebrew; to the fact that it is as natural for an Arab to serve in public office in Israel as it is incongruous to think of a Jew serving in any public office in an Arab country, indeed being admitted to many of them. Is that racism? It is not! That, Mr. President, is Zionism."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haredi Judaism and Zionism===
{{See also|Haredim and Zionism}}
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
Many Haredi Orthodox organizations oppose Zionism; they view Zionism as a secular movement. They reject nationalism as a doctrine and consider Judaism to be first and foremost a religion that is not dependent on a state. However, some Haredi movements (such as [[Shas]] since 2010) do openly affiliate with the Zionist movement.

Haredi rabbis do not consider Israel to be a [[halacha|halachic]] Jewish state because it has secular government. But they take responsibility for ensuring that Jews maintain religious ideals and, since most Israeli citizens are Jews, they pursue this agenda within Israel. Others reject any possibility of a Jewish state, since according to them a Jewish state is completely forbidden by Jewish religious law. In their view a Jewish state is considered an oxymoron.

Two Haredi parties run candidates in Israeli elections. They are sometimes associated with views that could be regarded as nationalist or Zionist. They prefer coalitions with more nationalist Zionist parties, probably because these are more interested in enhancing the Jewish nature of the Israeli state. The Sephardi-Orthodox party [[Shas]] rejected association with the Zionist movement; however, in 2010 it joined the [[World Zionist Organization]]. Its voters generally identify as Zionist, and Knesset members frequently pursue what others might consider a Zionist agenda. Shas has supported territorial compromise with the Arabs and Palestinians, but it generally opposes compromise over Jewish holy sites.

The non-Hasidic or 'Lithuanian' Haredi Ashkenazi world is represented by the Ashkenazi [[Agudat Israel]]/[[United Torah Judaism|UTJ]] party. It has always avoided association with the Zionist movement and usually avoids voting on or discussing issues related to peace, because its members do not serve in the army. The party works to ensure that Israel and Israeli law are in tune with the halacha, on issues such as [[Shabbat]] rest. The rabbinical leaders of the so-called [[Litvishe]] world in current and past generations, such as Rabbi [[Elazar Menachem Shach]] and Rabbi [[Avigdor Miller]], are strongly opposed to all forms of Zionism, religious and secular. But they allow members to participate in Israeli political life, including both passive and active participation in elections.

Many other [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] groups in Jerusalem, most famously the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Hasidim, as well as the larger movement they are part of, the [[Edah HaChareidis]], are strongly anti-Zionist. One of the best known Hasidic opponents of all forms of modern political Zionism was [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[rebbe]] and [[Talmud]]ic scholar [[Joel Teitelbaum]]. In his view, the current State of Israel is contrariwise to Judaism, because it was [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|founded]] by people who included some anti-religious personalities, and were in apparent violation of the traditional notion that Jews should wait for the Jewish Messiah.

Teitelbaum referred to core citations from classical Judaic sources in his arguments against modern Zionism; specifically a passage in the Talmud, in which Rabbi Yosi b'Rebbi Hanina explains (Kesubos 111a) that the Lord imposed "[[Three Oaths]]" on the nation of Israel: a) Israel should not return to the Land together, by force; b) Israel should not rebel against the other nations; and c) The nations should not subjugate Israel too harshly. According to Teitelbaum, the second oath is relevant concerning the subsequent wars fought between Israel and Arab nations.

Other opponent groups among the Edah HaChareidis were [[Dushinsky (Hasidic dynasty)|Dushinsky]], [[Toldos Aharon]], [[Toldos Avrohom Yitzchok]], [[Spinka]], and others. They number in the tens of thousands in Jerusalem, and hundreds of thousands worldwide.

To avoid accusations of antisemitism, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] has historically avoided using the word "Jewish" in favor of using "Zionist," though PLO officials have sometimes slipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3PNt46aB_sYC&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Native vs. Settler |author-last=Mitchell |author-first=Thomas G. |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2000 |page=48 |quote=To most Arabs the terms Jew or Jewish and Zionist are interchangeable.

Occasionally its leaders slip, as Arafat did when he referred to the "Jewish invasion" in his speech.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some antisemites have alleged that Zionism was, or is, part of a Jewish plot to take control of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Cohn]], [[Warrant for Genocide]], Serif 2001 chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; One particular version of these allegations, "[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]" (subtitle "Protocols extracted from the secret archives of the central chancery of Zion") achieved global notability. The protocols are fictional minutes of an imaginary meeting by Jewish leaders of this plot. Analysis and proof of their fraudulent origin goes as far back as 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/hoax.html|title=A Hoax of Hate|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1920 German version renamed them "[[The Zionist Protocols]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Cohn]], [[Warrant for Genocide]], Serif 2001 page 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; The protocols were [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion#toc|extensively used as propaganda]] by the Nazis and remain widely [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion#Modern era|distributed in the Arab world]]. They are referred to in the 1988 [[Hamas#Hamas Charter (1988)|Hamas charter]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamas charter, article 32: "The Zionist plan is limitless. After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates. When they will have digested the region they overtook, they will aspire to further expansion, and so on. Their plan is embodied in the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion"&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt;

There are examples of anti-Zionists using accusations, slanders, imagery and tactics previously associated with antisemites. On October 21, 1973, the then-Soviet ambassador to the United Nations [[Yakov Malik]] declared: "The Zionists have come forth with the theory of the [[Chosen People]], an absurd ideology."  Similarly, an exhibit about Zionism and Israel in the former Museum of Religion and Atheism in [[Saint Petersburg]] designated the following as Soviet Zionist material: Jewish [[tallit|prayer shawls]], ''[[tefillin]]'' and [[Passover]]'' [[Hagaddah]]s'',&lt;ref&gt;[[William Korey|Korey, W.]], "Updating the Protocols," ''Midstream'', May 1970, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; even though these are all ''religious'' items used by Jews for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="Why?"&gt;[[Dennis Prager|Prager, D]]; [[Joseph Telushkin|Telushkin, J]]. ''Why the Jews?: The Reason for Antisemitism''. New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1983. page 169-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, anti-Zionist writers such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Norman Finkelstein]], [[Michael Marder]], and [[Tariq Ali]] have argued that the characterization of anti-Zionism as antisemitic is inaccurate, that it sometimes obscures legitimate [[criticism of Israel]]'s policies and actions, and that it is sometimes used as a political ploy in order to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel.

* Professor [[Noam Chomsky]] argues: "There have long been efforts to identify anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism in an effort to exploit anti-racist sentiment for political ends; "one of the chief tasks of any dialogue with the Gentile world is to prove that the distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is not a distinction at all," Israeli diplomat Abba Eban argued, in a typical expression of this intellectually and morally disreputable position (Eban, Congress Bi-Weekly, March 30, 1973). But that no longer suffices. It is now necessary to identify criticism of Israeli policies as anti-Semitism&amp;nbsp;— or in the case of Jews, as "self-hatred," so that all possible cases are covered."&amp;nbsp;— Chomsky, 1989 "Necessary Illusions".
* Philosopher Michael Marder argues: "To deconstruct Zionism is ... to demand justice for its victims - not only for the Palestinians, who are suffering from it, but also for the anti-Zionist Jews, "erased" from the officially consecrated account of Zionist history. By deconstructing its ideology, we shed light on the context it strives to repress and on the violence it legitimises with a mix of theological or metaphysical reasoning and affective appeals to historical guilt for the undeniably horrific persecution of Jewish people in Europe and elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/12/here-why-deconstructing-zionism-important-201312863538927197.html|title=Here is why deconstructing Zionism is important|first=Michael|last=Marder|website=www.aljazeera.com|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Deconstructing-Zionism-Metaphysics-Contemporary-Philosophy/dp/1441105948/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383853271|title=Deconstructing Zionism: A Critique of Political Metaphysics|editor-first1=Gianni|editor-last1=Vattimo|editor-first2=Michael|editor-last2=Marder|date=November 21, 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|accessdate=March 12, 2018|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* American political scientist Norman Finkelstein argues that anti-Zionism and often just criticism of Israeli policies have been conflated with antisemitism, sometimes called [[new antisemitism]] for political gain: "Whenever Israel faces a public relations débâcle such as the Intifada or international pressure to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict, American Jewish organizations orchestrate this extravaganza called the 'new anti-Semitism.' The purpose is several-fold. First, it is to discredit any charges by claiming the person is an anti-Semite. It's to turn Jews into the victims, so that the victims are not the Palestinians any longer. As people like Abraham Foxman of the ADL put it, the Jews are being threatened by a new holocaust. It's a role reversal&amp;nbsp;— the Jews are now the victims, not the Palestinians. So it serves the function of discrediting the people leveling the charge. It's no longer Israel that needs to leave the Occupied Territories; it's the Arabs who need to free themselves of the anti-Semitism.&amp;nbsp;— &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Tariq Ali, a British-Pakistani historian and political activist, argues that the concept of new antisemitism amounts to an attempt to subvert the language in the interests of the State of Israel. He writes that the campaign against "the supposed new 'anti-semitism'" in modern Europe is a "cynical ploy on the part of the Israeli Government to seal off the Zionist state from any criticism of its regular and consistent brutality against the Palestinians&amp;nbsp;... Criticism of Israel can not and should not be equated with anti-semitism." He argues that most pro-Palestinian, anti-Zionist groups that emerged after the Six-Day War were careful to observe the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism. —&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Tariq.

==Marcus Garvey and Black Zionism==
{{See also|Alliance of Black Jews|Back-to-Africa movement}}
Zionist success in winning British support for the formation of a Jewish National Home in Palestine helped inspire the Jamaican [[Black nationalism|Black nationalist]] [[Marcus Garvey]] to form a movement dedicated to returning Americans of African origin to [[Africa]]. During a speech in [[Harlem]] in 1920, Garvey stated: "other races were engaged in seeing their cause through—the Jews through their Zionist movement and the Irish through their Irish movement—and I decided that, cost what it might, I would make this a favorable time to see the Negro's interest through."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Negro World]]'' March 6, 1920, cited in [http://www.international.ucla.edu/africa/mgpp/lifeintr.asp University of California, Los Angeles] (accessed November 29, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Garvey established a shipping company, the [[Black Star Line]], to allow Black Americans to emigrate to Africa, but for various reasons he failed in his endeavour.

Garvey helped inspire the [[Rastafari movement]] in Jamaica, the [[Beth Shalom B'nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation|Black Jews]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackjews.org/RabbiBios/RabbiFord.html BlackJews.org&amp;nbsp;— A Project of the International Board of Rabbis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030055447/http://www.blackjews.org/RabbiBios/RabbiFord.html |date=October 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem]] who initially moved to [[Liberia]] before settling in Israel.
