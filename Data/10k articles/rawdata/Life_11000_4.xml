'''Aggai''' was a 1st-century primate of the [[Church of the East]], and a disciple of [[Thaddeus of Edessa|Mar Addai]], who is believed to have sat from 66 to 81.
It was said that Aggai was one of the [[seventy apostles]], and was assigned the East as far as the border of India as his mission field.  Mar Addai, the traditional apostle of Mesopotamia, appointed him his successor shortly before his death. Like Addai before him, Aggai preached in various regions of the East.

==Sources==
Brief accounts of the life of Aggai are given in the ''Ecclesiastical Chronicle'' of the Jacobite writer [[Bar Hebraeus]] (''floruit'' 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amr (14th-century) and Sliba (14th-century).  These accounts differ slightly, and these minor differences are of significance for scholars interested in tracing the various stages in the development of the legend.

==Life of Aggai==
The following account of the life of Aggai is given by Bar Hebraeus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
After Addai the preacher of the gospel, his disciple Aggai.  This man used to weave Chinese cloth for [[Abgar]], and after the death of his master Addai fled into the East.  He began to preach throughout Persia, [[Assyria]], [[Armenia]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Babylonia]] and in the region of [[Khuzistan]] and among the Geles, right up to the borders of India.  Then he returned to Edessa, as he was afraid that the faith there might decline, because of the native superstition of Abgar's son, who had succeeded him as king.  When he reached Edessa, Abgar's son ordered him to weave Chinese cloth for him as he used to do for his father.  Aggai replied to him, 'When my master was feeding the flock of Christ, I used to work for your father.  But now the work of feeding has descended to me, and I cannot follow another trade.'  The native ruler was angry at his words, and killed him by breaking his leg bones.&lt;ref&gt;Bar Hebraeus, ''Ecclesiastical Chronicle'' (ed. Abeloos and Lamy), ii. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to another tradition, Aggai is said to have been murdered in church by one of the sons of King [[Abgar V of Edessa]].  Shortly before his death, Aggai is reported to have appointed Palut as his successor.

'''Björn Pétursson''' (1555-1596) was the only known [[serial killer]] in the [[history of Iceland]]. He was nicknamed '''Axlar-Björn''', which translates as "Shoulder-Bear" in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].

==Early life==
Axlar-Björn was the youngest of three children born to an Icelandic farmer couple in 1555. According to [[legend]], Axlar-Björn's mother Sigríður had a [[food craving|craving]] for human blood during her pregnancy and her husband indulged her by letting her drink his own blood. Sigríður also said that she had terrible [[nightmare]]s during the pregnancy, making her fear that she was carrying a monster. Axlar-Björn was an unruly and difficult child but otherwise normal.

==Murders==
[[File:2008-05-17_13_48_06_Iceland-Kvíabryggja.jpg|thumb|Abandoned farms in [[Snæfellsnes]].]]
When he was 15-years old, Axlar-Björn began to help in the farm of a rich neighbor named Ormur in exchange for room and board. One day, he took a nap instead of going to [[mass (liturgy)|mass]]. He dreamed that a stranger came to him and offered him meat to eat. Axlar-Björn found the meat delicious, but when he had eaten nineteen pieces of meat, he suddenly felt sick and stopped eating. The stranger then told him to climb the mountain Axlarhyrna where he would find an object that would make him famous. The next day, Axlar-Björn climbed the mountain and found an [[axe]] at the top. As per his later confession, Axlar-Björn used the axe to kill another 15-year-old farmboy and buried him in the dung heap.

Ormur died some years later from natural causes and left his estates to his son, Guðmundur. Guðmundur had become friends with Axlar-Björn during his employment, and gifted him a farm called Öxl in the Stadarsveit region of [[Snæfellsnes]]. Axlar-Björn took residence there with his wife, Þórdís.

The accounts differ on the motives, modus, number of victims, and events that led to the arrest of Axlar-Björn. Two numbers of victims, nine and eighteen, are the most common claims. The victims were travellers and farmhands that came to Öxl looking for work; some versions say that he hacked them with the axe and others that he drowned them. Local suspicions about Axlar-Björn grew as people disappeared in the area while his [[Icelandic horse|horses]] and other possessions increased, but he was safe because of the protection given to him by Guðmundur. Per one account, the final alarm was raised when a poor woman and her three children sought shelter in the farm. Axlar-Björn lured away, and murdered the children one by one, but the mother escaped and reported him.

==Arrest and execution==
[[File:Klassisches_Radern.png|thumb|A contemporary depiction of a [[breaking wheel]].]]
Axlar-Björn was arrested and confessed to nine murders, but authorities found more bodies when they searched his farm. Asked about them, Axlar-Björn claimed that he had found the remains buried in his land and decided to rebury them in another place without notifying authorities or bringing them to a cemetery. The authorities did not believe this explanation.

A [[þing]] sentenced Axlar-Björn to die by [[hanging]] followed by [[breaking wheel|breaking on the wheel]]. After his death, his body was dismembered and each piece put on a stake. Þórdís, who was pregnant at the time, was forced to watch the execution, and at the end had the amputated genitals of her husband thrown over her lap.

==Family aftermath==
Þórdís was accused of assisting her husband in the murders and even of committing some of the murders herself. She was also sentenced to death, but the execution was not carried out. The son she was carrying, Sveinn "Skotti" Björnsson, grew up to be a vagrant and a criminal, and was hanged for [[rape]] in 1648. After Sveinn's own son, Gísli "Hrokur" Sveinnsson, also became a criminal and was executed, there was speculation that Axlar-Björn's evil had been inherited by his descendants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13135">'''Bioleaching''' is the extraction of [[metal]]s from their [[ore]]s through the use of [[living organism]]s. This is much cleaner than the traditional [[heap leaching]] using [[cyanide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/01/gold/larmer-text/5 |title=Flotation technique cleaner than heap leaching |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date=2012-05-15 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioleaching is one of several applications within [[biohydrometallurgy]] and several methods are used to recover [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[lead]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], [[nickel]], [[molybdenum]], [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[cobalt]].

== Process ==
Bioleaching can involve numerous ferrous iron and sulfur oxidizing bacteria, including ''[[Acidithiobacillus]] ferrooxidans'' (formerly known as ''Thiobacillus ferrooxidans'') and ''Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans '' (formerly known as ''Thiobacillus thiooxidans''). As a general principle, Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are used to oxidize the ore. This step is entirely independent of microbes. The role of the bacteria is the further oxidation of the ore, but also the regeneration of the chemical oxidant Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; from Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, bacteria [[catalyst|catalyse]] the breakdown of the mineral [[pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by oxidising the [[sulfur]] and metal (in this case ferrous iron, (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;)) using [[oxygen]]. This yields [[Solubility|soluble]] [[product (chemistry)|products]] that can be further purified and refined to yield the desired metal.

'''[[Pyrite]] leaching''' (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):
In the first step, disulfide is spontaneously oxidized to [[thiosulfate]] by ferric ion (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), which in turn is reduced to give ferrous ion (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;):
:(1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{FeS_2 + 6 \ Fe^{\,3+} + 3 \ H_2O \longrightarrow 7 \ Fe^{\,2+} + S_2O_3^{\,2-} + 6 \ H^+}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;spontaneous

The ferrous ion is then oxidized by bacteria using oxygen:
:(2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{4 \ Fe^{\,2+} + \ O_2 + 4 \ H^+ \longrightarrow 4 \ Fe^{\,3+} + 2 \ H_2O}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(iron oxidizers)

Thiosulfate is also oxidized by bacteria to give sulfate:
:(3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S_2O_3^{\,2-} + 2 \ O_2 + H_2O \longrightarrow 2 \ SO_4^{\,2-} + 2 \ H^+}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(sulfur oxidizers)

The ferric ion produced in reaction (2) oxidized more sulfide as in reaction (1), closing the cycle and given the net reaction:
:(4)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{2 \ FeS_2 + 7 \ O_2 + 2 \ H_2O \longrightarrow 2 \ Fe^{\,2+} + 4 \ SO_4^{\,2-} + 4 \ H^+}&lt;/math&gt;

The net products of the reaction are soluble [[ferrous sulfate]] and [[sulfuric acid]].

The microbial oxidation process occurs at the [[cell membrane]] of the bacteria. The [[electron]]s pass into the [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and are used in [[biochemical]] processes to produce energy for the bacteria while reducing oxygen to [[water]]. The critical reaction is the oxidation of sulfide by ferric iron. The main role of the bacterial step is the regeneration of this reactant.

The process for copper is very similar, but the efficiency and kinetics depend on the copper mineralogy. The most efficient minerals are supergene minerals such as [[chalcocite]], Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and [[covellite]], CuS. The main copper mineral [[chalcopyrite]] (CuFeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is not leached very efficiently, which is why the dominant copper-producing technology remains flotation, followed by smelting and refining. The leaching of CuFeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; follows the two stages of being dissolved and then further oxidised, with Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions being left in solution.

'''[[Chalcopyrite]] leaching''':
:(1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CuFeS_2 + 4 \ Fe^{\,3+} \longrightarrow Cu^{\,2+} + 5 \ Fe^{\,2+} + 2 \ S_0}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;spontaneous
:(2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{4 \ Fe^{\,2+} + O_2 + 4 \ H^+ \longrightarrow 4 \ Fe^{\,3+} + 2 \ H_2O}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(iron oxidizers)
:(3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{2 \ S^0 + 3 \ O_2 + 2 \ H_2O \longrightarrow 2 \ SO_4^{\,2-} + 4 \ H^+}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(sulfur oxidizers)
net reaction:
:(4)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CuFeS_2 + 4 \ O_2 \longrightarrow Cu^{\,2+} + Fe^{\,2+} + 2 \ SO_4^{\,2-}}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, [[sulfide]]s are first oxidized to elemental sulfur, whereas [[disulfide]]s are oxidized to give [[thiosulfate]], and the processes above can be applied to other sulfidic ores. Bioleaching of non-sulfidic ores such as [[pitchblende]] also uses ferric iron as an oxidant (e.g., UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ==&gt; UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). In this case, the sole purpose of the bacterial step is the regeneration of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Sulfidic [[iron ore]]s can be added to speed up the process and provide a source of iron.  Bioleaching of non-sulfidic ores by layering of waste sulfides and elemental sulfur, colonized by ''Acidithiobacillus'' spp., has been accomplished, which provides a strategy for accelerated leaching of materials that do not contain sulfide minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Power, I.M., Dipple, G.M., and Southam, G. (2010) ''Bioleaching of ultramafic tailings by Acidithiobacillus spp. for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestration'', http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es900986n Environmental Science &amp; Technology. 44: 456-462.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further processing ==
The dissolved copper (Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions are removed from the solution by [[ligand]] exchange solvent extraction, which leaves other ions in the solution. The copper is removed by bonding to a ligand, which is a large molecule consisting of a number of smaller [[functional group|groups]], each possessing a [[lone electron pair]]. The ligand-copper complex is extracted from the solution using an [[organic compound|organic]] solvent such as [[kerosene]]:

:Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2LH(organic) &amp;rarr; CuL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(organic) + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;

The ligand donates electrons to the copper, producing a [[complex (chemistry)|complex]] - a central metal [[atom]] (copper) bonded to the ligand. Because this complex has no [[electric charge|charge]], it is no longer attracted to [[polar molecule|polar]] water molecules and dissolves in the kerosene, which is then easily separated from the solution. Because the initial [[chemical reaction|reaction]] is [[reversible reaction|reversible]], it is determined by pH. Adding concentrated acid reverses the equation, and the copper ions go back into an aqueous solution.

Then the copper is passed through an electro-winning process to increase its purity: An [[electric current]] is passed through the resulting solution of copper ions. Because copper ions have a 2+ charge, they are attracted to the negative [[cathode]]s and collect there.

The copper can also be concentrated and separated by [[single displacement reaction|displacing]] the copper with Fe from scrap iron:

:Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + Fe&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; Cu&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;

The electrons lost by the iron are taken up by the copper. Copper is the oxidising agent (it accepts electrons), and iron is the reducing agent (it loses electrons).

Traces of precious metals such as gold may be left in the original solution. Treating the mixture with [[sodium cyanide]] in the presence of free oxygen dissolves the gold. The gold is removed from the solution by [[adsorption|adsorbing]] (taking it up on the surface) to [[charcoal]].

==With fungi==
Several species of [[Fungus|fungi]] can be used for bioleaching. Fungi can be grown on many different substrates, such as [[e-waste|electronic scrap]], [[catalytic converter]]s, and [[fly ash]] from municipal waste [[incineration]]. Experiments have shown that two fungal [[strain (biology)|strains]] (''Aspergillus niger, Penicillium simplicissimum'') were able to mobilize Cu and Sn by 65%, and Al, Ni, Pb, and Zn by more than 95%. ''Aspergillus niger'' can produce some organic acids such as [[citric acid]].  This form of leaching does not rely on microbial oxidation of metal but rather uses microbial metabolism as source of acids that directly dissolve the metal.

==Compared with other extraction techniques==
Extractions involve many expensive steps such as [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]], pressure oxidation, and [[smelting]], which require sufficient concentrations of [[chemical element|elements]] in ores and are environmentally unfriendly. Low concentrations are not a problem for bacteria because they simply ignore the waste that surrounds the metals, attaining extraction yields of over 90% in some cases. These [[microorganism]]s actually gain [[energy]] by breaking down minerals into their constituent elements. The company simply collects the [[ion]]s out of the [[solution]] after the bacteria have finished. There is a limited amount of ores.

===Advantages===
*[[Economics|Economical]]: Bioleaching is in general simpler and, therefore, cheaper to operate and maintain than traditional processes, since fewer specialists are needed to operate complex [[chemical]] [[factory|plants]].
*[[pollution|Environmental]]: The process is more environmentally friendly than traditional extraction methods.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}  For the company this can translate into profit, since the necessary limiting of [[sulfur dioxide]] [[air pollution|emissions]] during smelting is expensive. Less landscape damage occurs, since the bacteria involved grow naturally, and the mine and surrounding area can be left relatively untouched. As the bacteria [[biological reproduction|breed]] in the conditions of the mine, they are easily cultivated and [[recycling|recycled]].
*Ore concentration: Bioleaching can be used to extract metals from ores that are too poor for other technologies. It can be used to partially replace the extensive crushing and grinding that translates to prohibitive cost and energy consumption in a conventional process.

===Disadvantages===
*Economical: The bacterial leaching process is very slow compared to smelting. This brings in less profit as well as introducing a significant delay in [[cash flow]] for new plants.
*Environmental: [[Toxicity|Toxic]] chemicals are sometimes produced in the process. [[Sulfuric acid]] and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions that have been formed can leak into the [[groundwater|ground]] and surface water turning it acidic, causing environmental damage. [[Heavy ion]]s such as [[iron]], zinc, and arsenic leak during [[acid mine drainage]]. When the [[pH]] of this solution rises, as a result of [[concentration|dilution]] by fresh water, these ions [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]], forming [[Acid mine drainage#Yellow boy|"Yellow Boy"]] pollution. For these reasons, a setup of bioleaching must be carefully planned, since the process can lead to a [[biosafety]] failure. Unlike other methods, once started, bioheap leaching cannot be quickly stopped, because leaching would still continue with rainwater and natural bacteria.

At the current time, it is more economical to smelt copper ore rather than to use bioleaching, since the concentration of copper in its ore is in general quite high. The profit obtained from the speed and yield of smelting justifies its cost. Nonetheless, at the largest copper mine of the world, [[Escondida]] in [[Chile]] the process seems to be favorable.

However, the concentration of gold in its ore is in general very low. In this case, the lower cost of bacterial leaching outweighs the time it takes to extract the metal.
Economically it is also very expensive and many companies once started can not keep up with the demand and end up in debt. Projects like Finnish [[Talvivaara]] proved to be environmentally and economically disastrous.

The '''blood sugar level, blood sugar concentration''', or '''blood glucose level''' is the amount of [[glucose]] present in the [[blood]] of humans and other animals. Glucose is a [[simple sugar]] and approximately 4&amp;nbsp;grams of glucose are present in the blood of a {{convert|70|kg|lb|adj=on}} human at all times.&lt;ref name="Glucose-Glycogen storage review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wasserman DH | title = Four grams of glucose | journal = American Journal of Physiology. Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 296 | issue = 1 | pages = E11-21 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18840763 | pmc = 2636990 | doi = 10.1152/ajpendo.90563.2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The body tightly [[blood sugar regulation|regulates blood glucose levels]] as a part of metabolic [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref name="Glucose-Glycogen storage review" /&gt; Glucose is stored in [[skeletal muscle]] and [[liver]] cells in the form of [[glycogen]];&lt;ref name="Glucose-Glycogen storage review" /&gt; in fasted individuals, blood glucose is maintained at a constant level at the expense of glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle.&lt;ref name="Glucose-Glycogen storage review" /&gt;

In humans, glucose is the primary [[food energy|source of energy]], and is critical for normal function, in a number of tissues,&lt;ref name="Glucose-Glycogen storage review" /&gt; particularly the [[human brain]] which consumes approximately 60% of blood glucose in fasted, sedentary individuals.&lt;ref name="Glucose-Glycogen storage review" /&gt; Glucose can be transported from the intestines or liver to other tissues in the body via the bloodstream.&lt;ref name="Glucose-Glycogen storage review" /&gt; Cellular glucose uptake is primarily regulated&lt;!--ref for additional uptake regulatory mechanisms: &lt;ref name="Glucose-Glycogen storage review" /&gt;--&gt; by [[insulin]], a [[hormone]] produced in the [[pancreas]].&lt;ref name="Glucose-Glycogen storage review" /&gt;

Glucose levels are usually lowest in the morning, before the first meal of the day, and rise after meals for an hour or two by a few [[millimolar|millimoles]].
Blood sugar levels outside the normal range may be an indicator of a medical condition. A persistently high level is referred to as [[hyperglycemia]]; low levels are referred to as [[hypoglycemia]]. [[Diabetes mellitus]] is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia from any of several causes, and is the most prominent disease related to failure of [[blood sugar regulation]]. There are different methods of [[glucose test|testing]] and measuring blood sugar levels.

The intake of [[alcohol]] causes an initial surge in blood sugar, and later tends to cause levels to fall. Also, certain drugs can increase or decrease glucose levels.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Rosemary and Rodgers, Jill (2006) ''Type 2 Diabetes – Your Questions Answered''. Dorling Kindersley. {{ISBN|1-74033-550-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Units==
The international standard way of measuring blood glucose levels is in terms of a [[molar concentration]], measured in [[mmol]]/L (millimoles per litre; or [[molar concentration|millimolar]], abbreviated mM). In the United States, Germany and other countries [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]] is measured in [[mg/dL]] (milligrams per decilitre).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110706100159/http://www.abbottdiabetescare.com.au/diabetes-faq-measure-units.php Diabetes FAQs – Blood Glucose Measurement Units – Abbott Diabetes Care]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[molecular weight]] of glucose C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is 180, the difference between the two units is a factor of 18, so that 1&amp;nbsp;mmol/L of glucose is equivalent to 18&amp;nbsp;mg/dL.&lt;ref name=convert/&gt;

==Normal values==
===Humans===
[[Reference ranges for blood tests#Other electrolytes and metabolites|Normal value ranges]] may vary slightly among different laboratories. Many factors affect a person's blood sugar level. The body's [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] mechanism of [[blood sugar regulation]] (known as [[Blood sugar regulation|glucose homeostasis]]), when operating normally, restores the blood sugar level to a narrow range of about 4.4 to 6.1&amp;nbsp;[[mmol]]/L (79 to 110&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) (as measured by a [[Glucose test#Reference ranges|fasting blood glucose test]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journal.diabetes.org/clinicaldiabetes/v18n22000/pg69.htm |title=Screening for Type 2 Diabetes|journal= Clinical Diabetes|volume=18 |issue=2|year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal blood glucose level (tested while fasting) for non-diabetics, should be between 3.9 and 7.1&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (70 to 130&amp;nbsp;mg/dL). The mean normal blood glucose level in humans is about 5.5&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (100&amp;nbsp;mg/dL);&lt;ref name=convert&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/diabetes/faq/part1/section-9.html What are mg/dl and mmol/l? How to convert? Glucose? Cholesterol?] Advameg, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; however, this level fluctuates throughout the day. Blood sugar levels for those without diabetes and who are not fasting should be below 6.9&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (125&amp;nbsp;mg/dL).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003482.htm Glucose test – blood]. NIH – National Institutes of Health.&lt;/ref&gt; The blood glucose target range for diabetics, according to the American Diabetes Association, should be 5.0–7.2&amp;nbsp;mmol/l (90–130&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) before meals, and less than 10&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (180&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) after meals (as measured by a blood glucose monitor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Davidson | first1 = Nancy Klobassa | last2 = Moreland | first2 = Peggy | name-list-format = vanc | date = 26 July 2011 | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/blood-glucose-target-range/MY00494 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130514173830/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/blood-glucose-target-range/MY00494 | archive-date = 14 May 2013 | title = Living with diabetes blog | work = Mayo Clinic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite widely variable intervals between meals or the occasional consumption of meals with a substantial [[carbohydrate]] load, human blood glucose levels tend to remain within the normal range. However, shortly after eating, the blood glucose level may rise, in non-diabetics, temporarily up to 7.8&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (140&amp;nbsp;mg/dL)  or slightly more.  For people with diabetes maintaining 'tight diabetes control', the [[American Diabetes Association]] recommends a post-meal glucose level of less than 10&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (180&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) and a fasting plasma glucose of 3.9 to 7.2&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (70–130&amp;nbsp;mg/dL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = American Diabetes Association | title = Standards of medical care in diabetes--2006 | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 29 Suppl 1 | issue = Supplement 1 | pages = S4-42 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16373931 | url = http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/suppl_1/s4.full | quote = Standards of Medical Care – Table 6 and Table 7, Correlation between A1C level and Mean Plasma Glucose Levels on Multiple Testing over 2–3 months }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual amount of glucose in the blood and body fluids is very small.  In a healthy adult male of 75&amp;nbsp;kg with a blood volume of 5 liters, a blood glucose level of 5.5&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (100&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) amounts to 5g, equivalent to about a teaspoonful of sugar.&lt;ref&gt;USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 22 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the reason why this amount is so small is that, to maintain an influx of glucose into cells, [[enzyme]]s modify glucose by adding [[phosphate]] or other groups to it.

===Other animals===

In general, ranges of blood sugar in common domestic ruminants are lower than in many [[monogastric]] mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Eiler H |year=2004 |chapter=Endocrine glands |pages=621–69 | veditors = Reese WO |title=Dukes' Physiology of Domestic Animals |edition=12th |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Comstock |isbn=0801442389 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   However this generalization does not extend to wild ruminants or camelids.  For serum glucose in mg/dL, reference ranges of 42 to 75 for cows, 44 to 81 for sheep, and 48 to 76 for goats, but 61 to 124 for cats; 62 to 108 for dogs, 62 to 114 for horses, 66 to 116 for pigs, 75 to 155 for rabbits, and 90 to 140 for llamas have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |veditors = Kahn CM |year=2005 |title=Merck Veterinary Manual |edition=9th |publisher=Merck &amp; Co. |location=Whitehouse Station |isbn=0911910506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 90 percent reference interval for serum glucose of 26 to 181&amp;nbsp;mg/dL has been reported for captured mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), where no effects of the pursuit and capture on measured levels were evident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rice, C.

==Regulation==&lt;!--Blood sugar regulation redirects here--&gt;
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
{{Main|Blood sugar regulation}}

The body's [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] mechanism keeps blood glucose levels within a narrow range. It is composed of several interacting systems, of which hormone regulation is the most important.

There are two types of mutually antagonistic metabolic hormones affecting blood glucose levels:
* [[catabolic]] hormones (such as [[glucagon]], [[cortisol]] and [[catecholamines]]) which increase blood glucose;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lehninger|first1=Albert|last2=Nelson|first2=David|last3=Cox|first3=Michael | name-list-format = vanc |title=Lehininger Principles of Biochemistry|date=2017|publisher=W.H. Freedom|location=New York|isbn=9781319117689|page=934}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* and one [[anabolic]] hormone ([[insulin]]), which decreases blood glucose.

These hormones are secreted from pancreatic islets which are bundles of endocrine tissues. There are four types of pancreatic islets, alpha (A) cells, beta (B) cells, Delta (D) cells and F cells. Glucagon is secreted from alpha cells, while insulin is secreted by beta cells. Together they regulate the blood-glucose levels through negative feedback, a process where the end product of one reaction stimulates the beginning of another reaction. In blood-glucose levels, insulin lowers the concentration of glucose in the blood. The lower blood-glucose level (a product of the insulin secretion) triggers glucagon to be secreted, and repeats the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tortora|first1=Gerard | name-list-format = vanc |title=Principles Anatomy and Physiology|date=December 2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9781119343738|pages=Chapter 18|edition=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for blood glucose to be kept stable, modifications to insulin, glucagon, epinephrine and cortisol are made. Each of these hormones has a different responsibility to keep blood glucose regulated; when blood sugar is too high, insulin tells muscles to take up excess glucose for storage. Glucagon responds to too low of a blood glucose level; it informs the tissue to produce more glucose. Epinephrine prepares the muscles and respiratory system for activity in the case of a "fight and flight" response. Lastly, cortisol supplies the body with fuel in times of heavy stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lehninger|first1=Albert|last2=Nelson|first2=David|last3=Cox|first3=Michael| name-list-format = vanc |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry|date=2017|publisher=W.H.Freeman|location=New York|isbn=9781319117689|page=930|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abnormalities==

===High blood sugar===
{{main|hyperglycemia}}

If blood sugar levels remain too high the body suppresses appetite over the short term. Long-term [[hyperglycemia]] causes many long-term health problems including heart disease, cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/02/130201100149.htm|title=Excess sugar linked to cancer|work=Science Daily|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; eye, kidney, and nerve damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-ketoacidosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20371551|title=Diabetic ketoacidosis - Symptoms and causes|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blood sugar levels above 300 can cause fatal reactions. Ketones will be very high (a magnitude higher than when eating a very low carbohydrate diet) initiating ketoacidosis. Mayo clinic recommends emergency room treatment above 300&amp;nbsp;mg/dL blood glucose.

The most common cause of hyperglycemia is [[diabetes]]. When diabetes is the cause, physicians typically recommend an [[anti-diabetic medication]] as treatment. From the perspective the majority of patients, treatment with an old, well-understood diabetes drug such as [[metformin]] will be the safest, most effective, least expensive, most comfortable route to managing the condition.&lt;ref name="BBDdiabetesM2"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1 = Consumer Reports Health Best Buy Drugs |author1-link = Consumer Reports|title = The Oral Diabetes Drugs: Treating Type 2 Diabetes |work = Best Buy Drugs |publisher = [[Consumer Reports]] |page =2 |url = http://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/best-buy-drugs/DiabetesUpdate-FINAL-Feb09.pdf |access-date = 18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diet changes and exercise implementation may also be part of a treatment plan for diabetes.

Fasting blood glucose levels may be higher than the post meal blood glucose in many of the healthy subjects. Such individuals may be said to have physiological insulin resistance and may develop diabetes mellitus as long term complication. In clinical and laboratory practices, many of the time a healthy normal subject will present a fasting blood glucose value higher than the post meal blood glucose value. This creates confusion since there is a common perception that in blood, postprandial (PP) glucose level should be higher than fasting (F) glucose level. The repeated investigation subsequently yields somewhat similar type of result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Warade | first = Jayesh Prabhakar | name-list-format = vanc |title=Fasting blood glucose level higher than post-meal in healthy subjects: a study of 738 subjects|journal=World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research|volume=3|issue=4|year=2014|url=http://isindexing.com/isi/papers/1416654840.pdf|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160359/http://isindexing.com/isi/papers/1416654840.pdf|archive-date=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low blood sugar===
{{main|hypoglycemia}}

If blood sugar levels drop too low, a potentially fatal condition called [[hypoglycemia]] develops. Symptoms may include [[lethargy]], impaired mental functioning; [[irritability]]; shaking, twitching, weakness in arm and leg muscles; pale complexion; sweating; [[Unconsciousness|loss of consciousness]].

Mechanisms that restore satisfactory blood glucose levels after extreme [[hypoglycemia]] (below 40&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) must be quick and effective to prevent extremely serious consequences of insufficient glucose: confusion or unsteadiness and, in the extreme (below 15&amp;nbsp;mg/dL)  loss of consciousness and seizures. Without discounting the potentially quite serious conditions and risks due to or oftentimes accompanying hyperglycemia, especially in the long-term (diabetes or pre-diabetes, obesity or overweight, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, etc.), it is still generally more dangerous to have too little glucose – especially if levels are very low – in the blood than too much, at least temporarily, because glucose is so important for metabolism and nutrition and the proper functioning of the body's organs. This is especially the case for those organs that are metabolically active or that require a constant, regulated supply of blood sugar (the liver and brain are examples). In healthy individuals, blood glucose-regulating mechanisms are generally quite effective, and symptomatic hypoglycemia is generally found only in diabetics using insulin or other pharmacological treatment, and in starvation or severe malnutrition or malabsorption (of various causes), and conditions such as anorexia{{dubious|date=May 2013}}. Hypoglycemic episodes can vary greatly between persons and from time to time, both in severity and swiftness of onset. For severe cases, prompt medical assistance is essential, as damage to brain and other tissues and even death will result from sufficiently low blood-glucose levels.

==Glucose measurement==
{{Further| Blood glucose monitoring|Glucose meter}}

===Sample source===
[[Glucose test]]ing in a fasting individual, show comparable levels of glucose in arterial, venous, and capillary blood. But following meals, capillary and arterial blood glucose levels can be significantly higher than venous levels. Although these differences vary widely, one study found that following the consumption of 50 grams of glucose, "the mean capillary blood glucose concentration is higher than the mean venous blood glucose concentration by 35%."&lt;ref name=yang&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang C | year = 2012 | title = A Comparison between Venous and Finger-Prick Blood Sampling on Values of Blood Glucose | url = http://www.ipcbee.com/vol39/040-ICNFS2012-N3003.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Proceedings of Chemical, Biological and Environmental Engineering | volume = 39 | page = 236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Somogyi M | title = Studies of arteriovenous differences in blood sugar; effect of alimentary hyperglycemia on the rate of extrahepatic glucose assimilation | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 174 | issue = 1 | pages = 189–200 | date = May 1948 | pmid = 18914074 | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/174/1/189.full.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Roe | first = Jeffrey | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.bestthinking.com/articles/medicine/internal_medicine/hematology/glucose-concentration-difference-between-arterial-capillary-and-venous-blood | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141204114840/http://www.bestthinking.com/articles/medicine/internal_medicine/hematology/glucose-concentration-difference-between-arterial-capillary-and-venous-blood | archive-date = 4 December 2014 | dead-url = yes | title = Glucose Concentration Difference Between Arterial, Capillary, and Venous Blood | work = Best Thinking }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sample type===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
Glucose is measured in whole blood, [[blood plasma|plasma]] or [[blood serum|serum]]. Historically, blood glucose values were given in terms of whole blood, but most laboratories now measure and report plasma or serum glucose levels. Because [[red blood cell]]s (erythrocytes) have a higher concentration of protein (e.g., hemoglobin) than serum, serum has a higher water content and consequently more dissolved glucose than does whole blood. To convert from whole-blood glucose, multiplication by 1.14&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=David L | last2 = Nelson | first2 = Michael M.| name-list-format = vanc |title=Lehninger principles of biochemistry|date=2013|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=New York|isbn=9781429234146|pages=950|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been shown to generally give the serum/plasma level

To prevent contamination of the sample with [[intravenous fluids]], particular care should be given to drawing blood samples from the arm opposite the one in which an intravenous line is inserted. Alternatively, blood can be drawn from the same arm with an IV line after the IV has been turned off for at least 5 minutes, and the arm has been elevated to drain infused fluids away from the vein. Inattention can lead to large errors, since as little as 10% contamination with a 5% [[glucose]] solution (D5W) will elevate glucose in a sample by 500&amp;nbsp;mg/dL or more. The actual concentration of glucose in blood is very low, even in the hyperglycemic.

===Measurement techniques===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
Two major methods have been used to measure glucose. The first, still in use in some places, is a chemical method exploiting the nonspecific reducing property of glucose in a reaction with an indicator substance that changes color when reduced. Since other blood compounds also have reducing properties (e.g., urea, which can be abnormally high in uremic patients), this technique can produce erroneous readings in some situations (5–15&amp;nbsp;mg/dL has been reported). The more recent technique, using enzymes specific to glucose, is less susceptible to this kind of error. The two most common employed enzymes are glucose oxidase and hexokinase.&lt;ref name="W.H. Freeman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Michael M.|last2=Lehninger|first2=Albert L.|last3=Nelson|first3=David L.| name-list-format = vanc |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry|date=2017|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=New York|isbn=9781319117689|pages=248–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average blood glucose concentrations can also be measured. This method measures the level of [[glycated hemoglobin]], which is representative of the average blood glucose levels over the last, approximately, 120 days.&lt;ref name="W.H. Freeman"/&gt;

In either case, the chemical system is commonly contained on a test strip which is inserted into a meter, and then has a blood sample applied. Test-strip shapes and their exact chemical composition vary between meter systems and cannot be interchanged. Formerly, some test strips were read (after timing and wiping away the blood sample) by visual comparison against a color chart printed on the vial label. Strips of this type are still used for urine glucose readings, but for blood glucose levels they are obsolete. Their error rates were, in any case, much higher. Errors when using test strips were often caused by the age of the strip or exposure to high temperatures or humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ginsberg BH | title = Factors affecting blood glucose monitoring: sources of errors in measurement | journal = Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 903–13 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 20144340 | pmc = 2769960 | doi = 10.1177/193229680900300438 | url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/193229680900300438 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More precise blood glucose measurements are performed in a [[medical laboratory]], using hexokinase, glucose oxidase, or glucose dehydrogenase enzymes.

[[Urine glucose]] readings, however taken, are much less useful. In properly functioning kidneys, glucose does not appear in urine until the [[renal threshold]] for glucose has been exceeded. This is substantially above any normal glucose level, and is evidence of an existing severe hyperglycemic condition. However, as urine is stored in the bladder, any glucose in it might have been produced at any time since the last time the bladder was emptied. Since metabolic conditions change rapidly, as a result of any of several factors, this is delayed news and gives no warning of a developing condition. Blood glucose monitoring is far preferable, both clinically and for home monitoring by patients. Healthy urine glucose levels were first standardized and published in 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Renschler HE, Weicker H, von Baeyer H | title = [The upper limit of glucose concentration in the urine of healthy subjects] | journal = Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift | volume = 90 | issue = 53 | pages = 2349–53 | date = December 1965 | pmid = 5851934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Hans Renschler]].

===Clinical correlation===
The fasting blood glucose level, which is measured after a fast of 8 hours, is the most commonly used indication of overall glucose homeostasis, largely because disturbing events such as food intake are avoided. Conditions affecting glucose levels are shown in the table below. Abnormalities in these test results are due to problems in the multiple control mechanism of glucose regulation.

The metabolic response to a carbohydrate challenge is conveniently assessed by a postprandial glucose level drawn 2 hours after a meal or a glucose load. In addition, the glucose tolerance test, consisting of several timed measurements after a standardized amount of oral glucose intake, is used to aid in the diagnosis of [[diabetes]].

Error rates for blood glucose measurements systems vary, depending on laboratories, and on the methods used. Colorimetry techniques can be biased by color changes in test strips (from airborne or finger borne contamination, perhaps) or interference (e.g., tinting contaminants) with light source or the light sensor. Electrical techniques are less susceptible to these errors, though not to others. In home use, the most important issue is not accuracy, but trend. Thus if a meter / test strip system is consistently wrong by 10%, there will be little consequence, as long as changes (e.g., due to exercise or medication adjustments) are properly tracked. In the US, home use blood test meters must be approved by the federal [[Food and Drug Administration]] before they can be sold.

Finally, there are several influences on blood glucose level aside from food intake. Infection, for instance, tends to change blood glucose levels, as does stress either physical or psychological. Exercise, especially if prolonged or long after the most recent meal, will have an effect as well. In the typical person, maintenance of blood glucose at near constant levels will nevertheless be quite effective.{{Clarify|date=August 2010}}

'''''Bounty''''' was an enlarged reconstruction of the original 1787 [[Royal Navy]] sailing ship {{HMS|Bounty}}. Built in [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia]] in 1960, she sank off the coast of [[North Carolina]] during [[Hurricane Sandy]] on 29 October 2012.

The [[tall ship]] was often referred to as HMS ''Bounty'', but was not entitled to the use of the prefix "HMS" as she was not commissioned into the [[Royal Navy]]. Here "HMS" is treated as part of the popular name, and not as a [[ship prefix]].

==History==

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===
''Bounty'' was commissioned by the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film studio for the 1962 film [[Mutiny on the Bounty (1962 film)|''Mutiny on the Bounty'']]. She was the first large vessel built from scratch for a film using historical sources. Previous film vessels were fanciful conversions of existing vessels. ''Bounty'' was built to extrapolated original ship's drawings from files in the British [[Admiralty]] archives, and in the traditional manner by more than 200 workers over an 8-month period at the [[Smith and Rhuland]] shipyard in [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;''After the Cameras Stopped Rolling; The Journey of the Bounty''. Warner Home Entertainment 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  To assist film-making and carry production staff, her general dimensions were greatly increased resulting in a vessel nearly twice the tonnage of the original. While built primarily for film use, she was fully equipped for sailing because of the requirement to move her a great distance to the filming location.&lt;ref name=Warner /&gt;
Two other well known reproductions were built at the yard subsequent to ''Bounty'';  ''[[Bluenose II]]'' and [[HMS Surprise (replica ship)|HMS ''Rose'']].&lt;ref&gt;Gilkerson, William, "Replicas: History of a Phenomenon", ''Wooden Boat'', No. 172, May/June 2003, pp. 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bounty'' was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 27 August 1960. Crewed by Lunenburg fishermen and film staff, the vessel sailed via the [[Panama Canal]] to [[Tahiti]] for filming. ''Bounty'' was scheduled to be burned at the end of the film, but actor [[Marlon Brando]] protested, so MGM kept the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tallshipbounty.org/the-ship/bounty-background.php Background Story] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101135715/http://www.tallshipbounty.org/the-ship/bounty-background.php |date=1 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After filming and a worldwide promotional tour, the ship was berthed in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] as a permanent tourist attraction, where she stayed until the mid-1980s.

The ship was also featured in an episode of [[Flipper (1964 TV series)|''Flipper'']] titled "Flipper and the Bounty" which aired 11 December 1965.

The ship was featured in the 1983 film, ''[[Yellowbeard]]'', a comedy about pirates starring [[Graham Chapman]], [[Peter Boyle]] and many other comedic stars, including [[Marty Feldman]] in his final role before suffering a heart attack during production.

In 1986, [[Ted Turner]] acquired the MGM film library and ''Bounty'' with it. The ship was used for promotion and entertainment, and was used during the filming of [[Treasure Island (1990 film)|''Treasure Island'']] with [[Charlton Heston]] and [[Christian Bale]] in 1989.

===Fall River, Massachusetts===

In 1993, Turner donated the ship to the Fall River Chamber Foundation, Inc, which established the Tall Ship Bounty Foundation, Inc to operate the ship for educational "adventures" as well as a tourist attraction and celebrity promoter of [[Fall River, Massachusetts]]. ''Bounty'' summered in [[New England]] waters operating out of the Heritage State Park facilities in Fall River and wintered in [[Florida]] operating out of the [[St. Petersburg Pier]].

The ship was booked to appear in several feature films in the mid-1990s, such as a remake of the 1935 film [[Captain Blood (1935 film)|''Captain Blood'']], starring [[Errol Flynn]], and a film about [[Anne Bonny]], an 18th-century female pirate. Both projects were shelved before production began. The ship was set to appear in the 1997 [[Steven Spielberg]] film [[Amistad (film)|''Amistad'']], but before her scenes were shot in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], filming of the [[slave ship]] rebellion at the beginning of the film was moved to [[Puerto Rico]] and [[California]]. However, the ship did appear in several documentaries during her eight-year stay in Fall River.

In the mid-1990s, Marlon Brando, star of the 1962 version of ''Mutiny on the Bounty'', showed interest in using the ship for a project in the area of his island in the South Pacific. However, he was surprised at what it cost to operate a ship with a crew on a weekly basis, and he passed on the idea.

While under ownership of the Tall Ship Bounty Foundation, the ship went into dry-dock twice and had major improvements to the ships ribs and planks. During the second dry docking, Captain Robin Walbridge decided to permanently remove the copper cladding and in its place applied marine anti-fouling paint to repel the insects that bore into the wood. Due to lack of commitment to long term funding by the private and public sectors, the trustees of the Tall Ship Bounty Foundation, Inc. determined it was time to put the ship up for sale. Due to cash flow problems all the crew's contracts were terminated and volunteers kept a watch over ''Bounty'' at its dock at Heritage State Park. On 15 March 2001, the ship was sold to the HMS Bounty Foundation.

In 2005, while moored in St. Petersburg, ''Bounty'' was the shooting location of the "pornographic action-adventure" film [[Pirates (2005 film)|''Pirates'']].

===Restoration===
The ship's declining condition caused the vessel to temporarily lose her [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] license,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} but ''Bounty'' was restored. The vessel's bottom planking was replaced and repaired as required at the [[Boothbay Harbor]] Shipyard in 2002. Moored in her winter home in St. Petersburg, Florida, she again became available for charter, excursions, sail-training, and movies, including ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' and ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |title=Brando's Bounty's Sailing In |work=[[Bristol Evening Post]] |page=6 |date=5 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006, ''Bounty'' returned to Boothbay Harbor for further refit including repairs to her forward sections and decks. Following this work, ''Bounty'' was scheduled to repeat the famous voyage of the original ''Bounty''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoey |first=Dennis |title=This project would make Brando smile; The Bounty of movie fame in Maine for repairs |work=[[Portland Press Herald]] |page=B1 |date=2 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2006 refit, the ship was virtually rebuilt to make her appearance more similar to that of the original HMS ''Bounty'', and make her more suitable for service as a sail training vessel. Her lower decks were cleared of most of its 18th-century-style furnishings and living spaces, including the Great Cabin, the galley, and the officers' quarters. The color of the ship's hull was changed from ocean-blue to black and dark green.

===Post-restoration, thieves, and sale attempt===
In August 2007, ''Bounty'' had just completed a US $3 million restoration and was making a seven-week UK tour prior to embarking on a world tour via South Africa and New Zealand to [[Pitcairn]] (home to the original Bounty descendants) and Tahiti. The UK ports tour included a visit to [[Maryport]], Cumbria, the birthplace of mutiny leader Fletcher Christian. On Saturday 12 September 2009, the ship was berthed at Custom House Quay in [[Greenock]], [[Inverclyde]], [[Scotland]]. At about 04:10 [[British Summer Time|BST]] thieves targeted the ship and stole a small sum of cash, several items of clothing with ''Bounty''{{'}}s insignia, a [[survival suit]], a book, a [[life ring]] and an American flag. The items were later recovered nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8254295.stm |title='Pirates' ship looted in Scotland |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=14 September 2009 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October 2012, the vessel left [[New London, Connecticut]], heading for St. Petersburg, Florida, initially going on an easterly course to avoid [[Hurricane Sandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/29/us/sandy-bounty-ship/index.html |first=Mark |last=Morgenstein |title=Sandy claims 'Bounty' off North Carolina |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=29 October 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Outside&gt;[http://www.outsideonline.com/1913636/sunk-incredible-truth-about-ship-never-should-have-sailed Sunk: The Incredible Truth About a Ship That Never Should Have Sailed], Kathryn Miles, Feb 11, 2013, ''Outside Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial request for Coast Guard assistance was sent in an email by the captain to the vessel's organization.&lt;ref name=USGCMAB1403&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/MAB1403.pdf |title=NTSB/MAB-14/03 Sinking of Tall Ship Bounty |work=Marine Accident Brief |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=6 February 2014 |accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about 8:45 pm [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]], the organization relayed the request to Coast Guard Sector North Carolina about ''Bounty''{{'}}s situation.&lt;ref name=USGCMAB1403 /&gt;  Shortly thereafter the ''Bounty'' crew activated one of ''Bounty''{{'}}s [[EPIRB]] beacons.&lt;ref name=USGCMAB1403 /&gt; Walbridge had reported the ship was taking on water, and the crew was preparing to abandon ship.&lt;ref name=USGCMAB1403 /&gt; Afterwards ''Bounty'' lost electrical power due to water flooding the starboard generator.&lt;ref name=USGCMAB1403 /&gt;

This information was sent to a Coast Guard [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]] rescue airplane crew that was stationed in North Carolina at [[Raleigh-Durham Airport]].&lt;ref name=Outside /&gt; The ship's location was given as roughly 90 miles southeast of the [[Outer Banks]] in the vicinity of a feature on the ocean floor known as the [[Hatteras Canyon]].&lt;ref name=Outside /&gt; The C-130 rescue plane underwent equipment outages on its rescue flight, including its anti-icing system and its weather radar.&lt;ref name=Outside /&gt; This caused the pilot (Lieutenant Wes McIntosh) and the co-pilot (Mike Myers) to conduct the search at approximately {{convert|500|ft|m}} [[AMSL]] in an attempt to locate the vessel visually, around midnight and with poor visibility.&lt;ref name=Outside /&gt; Shortly after midnight on 29 October, the stricken vessel was discovered.

The USCG aircraft made radio contact with John Svendsen, ''Bounty''{{'}}s first mate, as the C-130 circled the ship in the early morning hours.&lt;ref name=Outside /&gt; ''Bounty'' was listing at about a 45 degree angle on its [[starboard]] side. As the C-130 crew radioed instructions to ''Bounty'', the plane circled for hours while preparations were made. Meanwhile, helicopter crews from [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina|Elizabeth City]] were instructed to prepare for a very difficult rescue operation. At 4:45 am, Svendsen radioed to the C-130 that the ship was sinking and the crew needed immediate assistance.&lt;ref name=Outside /&gt;  McIntosh flew the plane lower and readied his crew to drop life rafts and supplies. With the plane short on fuel, the C-130 dropped liferafts but had to leave the vessel and crew on their own in rough seas and {{convert|50|kn|adj=on}} winds. It would be more than an hour until the first [[Sikorsky MH-60 Jayhawk|Jayhawk]] helicopter arrived on the scene to begin the dangerous rescue attempt around dawn.&lt;ref name=Outside /&gt; One member of the Coast Guard crew received major injuries during the rescue.&lt;ref name=Outside /&gt;

MFV '''''Bugaled Breizh''''' is a Breton [[Commercial trawler|trawler]] from [[Loctudy]], [[Finistère]], whose sinking with all hands in 90 metres of water on 15 January 2004 remains unresolved. While it appeared possible that the ship was pulled under by a [[submarine]], a specific submarine could not be identified from among the number of submarines of several nations operating in the general vicinity of the accident site.  Moreover, the condition of the ship's recovered trawling equipment was reported by a technical inquiry to not be consistent with a submarine entanglement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bea-mer.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/RET_BUGALED_BREIZH_En_Site.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==The accident==
The motorized fishing vessel (MFV) was built in 1986 by the Bretagne Sud shipyard in [[Belz, Morbihan|Belz]].&lt;ref name=miramar&gt;{{csr|register=MSI|id=8429|shipname=Bugaled Breizh |accessdate=2009-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bugaled Breizh'' (Children of [[Brittany]]) capsized with five sailors about {{convert|14|nmi|km}} southwest of [[Lizard Point, Cornwall]] on 15 January 2004 at 12h25 [[UTC]]. Weather in the area at the time was southwesterly winds of 25-30 knots and 2-3 mile visibility.  The ship briefly radioed that it was sinking, and disappeared apparently very quickly; only two bodies of the five sailors were recovered at the time, while a third body was recovered on 10 July 2004 during salvage operations in 90 meters of water depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/3884115.stm | work=BBC News | title=Third body recovered from trawler | date=11 July 2004 |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inquiry ==
Immediately investigations were started by the French authorities in [[Quimper, Finistère|Quimper]]. Several explanations were advanced to explain the capsizing including a fishing accident, collision with a surface ship, rock or wreck, the presence of a sandbank, and an accident involving a submarine.&lt;ref name=dsm/&gt; In June 2004 the ship was raised for forensic examinations. The fish hold showed a compression due to the water pressure. In the absence of evidence of any ramming, the hypothesis of a collision with a surface ship could be abandoned.

===Submarine entanglement theory ===
Several hours after the sinking an announcement was made by the French [[Maritime Prefect]] for the Atlantic that a [[NATO]] naval exercise involving submarines was taking place in the area. The Dutch submarine {{HNLMS|Dolfijn|1990|2}} was one of the first ships to reach the site of the sinking and was suspected to be involved in the accident.&lt;ref name=dsm&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.dutchsubmarines.com/news/news_dolfijn4_bugaled_breizh.htm |title=Dolfijn and the Bugaled Breizh | publisher = Dutch Submarines| accessdate= 8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British submarine {{HMS|Turbulent|S87|2}} was also suspect as it was sent for repair after the exercises. However, according to authorities ''Dolfijn'' was at least {{convert|15|km|nmi}} away and the [[Royal Navy]] indicated as well that its submarines were not at the site where ''Bugaled Breizh'' sank.&lt;ref name=dsm/&gt; Other reports mention that the {{ship|German submarine|U-22|S171|2|up=yes}}, the British nuclear attack submarine {{HMS|Torbay|S90|2}}, and two French nuclear attack submarines, {{ship|French submarine|Rubis|S601|2}} and {{ship|French submarine|Saphir|S602|2}}, were also present in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corlobe.tk/article648.html#La-carte-des-zones-d-exercice-de |work=Le portail des sous-marins |title=Bugaled Breizh: erreurs et omissions pour "Pièces à conviction" |language=French |publisher=Corlobe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081104072417/http://www.corlobe.tk/article648.html#La-carte-des-zones-d-exercice-de |archivedate=November 4, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another submarine noted in the area was {{HMS|Triumph|S93|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.irishseashipping.com/news/2008/04_2008/04_2008.htm| title=Bugaled Breizh |publisher=Irish Sea Shipping|date=20 April 2008 | accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there was apparently a submarine of unknown origin that was observing the NATO maneuvers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corlobe.tk/article5592.html |work=Le portail des sous-marins |title=Un sous-marin espion accusé d'avoir coulé le Bugaled Breizh |language=French |publisher=Corlobe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031024711/http://www.corlobe.tk/article5592.html |archivedate=October 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis that ''Bugaled Breizh'' was sunk by an accident with a submarine can explain a number of unusual observations. The ship apparently sank very rapidly, there was no launching of any rescue boat, and the help signal was brief, without giving the coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cornwall/3886983.stm |first=Jonathan |last=Morris |title=Answers sought on trawler tragedy |date=12 July 2004 |accessdate = 8 July 2015 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trawler line of the ship was drawn out on the port side in contrast to the starboard one. The long cable is also reported to have traces of titanium; it has been proposed that this originates from the surface of a submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishseashipping.co.uk/archives/subsite/news/2006/09_2006/092006.htm |title=Bugeled Breizh Enquiry |publisher=Irish Sea Shipping |date=2006-09-27 |accessdate=2009-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723110842/http://www.irishseashipping.co.uk/archives/subsite/news/2006/09_2006/092006.htm |archivedate=July 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NATO documents have been declassified and were released to the French judiciary. The Minister of Defense [[Michèle Alliot-Marie]] indicated to the National Assembly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/cri/2004-2005/20050211.asp#TopOfPage | title = Questions for the Government | publisher = Assemblée nationale | language = French |date=4 May 2005 |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the information she had did not allow her to suspect a submarine as the cause of the accident. She indicated that the British and French authorities had cooperated and provided a list of all their ships and submarines in the area of interest. Also, the titanium issue was considered trivial as [[titanium dioxide]] is a common pigment of marine paint including the one used for ''Bugaled Breizh''.

The report of the French Marine Accident Investigation Office ([[Bureau d'enquêtes sur les événements de mer]] or BEAmer) was published on 27 November  2006 and examined a number of possible causes; it rejected the proposition that fishing lines got entangled with a military submarine and concluded that "the hypothesis that the fishing line got buried in a sandbank is more consistent with the evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beamer-france.org/enquetes/enquetes.htm |title=Official report |publisher=BEAmer |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110052744/http://www.beamer-france.org/enquetes/enquetes.htm |archivedate=January 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, the hypothesis of a fishing accident was received with skepticism by the fishing community. It believed that the governmental BEA — it is under the jurisdiction of the [[Minister of Transport (France)|Ministry of Transport]] — tried to avoid a diplomatic incident with the military and its allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.letelegramme.com/gratuit/generales/regions/bretagne/bugaled-breizh-la-bataille-des-magistrats-20080731-3542761_1411763.php | language = French | title = Bugaled Breizh : La Bataille des magistrats |date=31 July 2008 | publisher = Le Télégramme |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the French Institute of Research for the Exploration of the Ocean subsequently rejected the proposition of BEAmer as impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france-info.com/spip.php?article57622&amp;theme=9&amp;sous_theme=11 |publisher=France Info |title=Rejection of thesis of fishing accident |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624060434/http://www.france-info.com/spip.php?article57622&amp;theme=9&amp;sous_theme=11 |archivedate=June 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expert testimony indicated that a nuclear submarine that got entangled in the net of a trawler could pull down a vessel of about 250 tons within 80 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Fatal-trawler-probe-t-trace-culprit/story-11707990-detail/story.html| title=Fatal trawler probe can't trace 'culprit'| date=8 February 2008 |accessdate=9 August 2015 |publisher=western morning news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent newspaper article states that an unnamed witness thought that British submarine ''Turbulent'' may have been involved in the ship's sinking.&lt;ref name="express20101211"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/justice/bugaled-breizh-un-temoin-evoque-un-sous-marin-britannique_944482.html |title=Bugaled Breizh: un témoin évoque un sous-marin britannique |work=L'Express |language=French |date=11 December 2010 |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Judge Brigette Lamy said she agreed with reports that the submarine was in Plymouth at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-21230597 | work=BBC News | title=Submarine HMS Turbulent 'in port during Bugaled Breizh trawler sinking' | date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, 2015, the British ministry of Defense Penny Mordaunt recognized that a British submarine caught the trawl of the Irish fishing trawler "The Karen" on April 15, 2015, in an incident similar to that of the Bugaled Breizh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agencebretagnepresse.com/38312&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conclusion of inquiry without specific cause===
On 31 July 2008, the judges Richard Foltzer and Muriel Corre, who had been charged with the inquiry into the sinking of ''Bugaled Breizh'', after having received expert testimony, issued a statement that a "highly probable cause" that the vessel sank was as a result of an accident with a nuclear [[attack submarine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/fatal-trawler-probe-t-trace-culprit/story-11707990-detail/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4378899.stm | work= BBC News | title = French trawler Bugaled Breizh 'was sunk by sub' | date=24 March 2005 | accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were unable to indicate which submarine was involved and indicated also the possibility that the accident may have been caused by the unidentified spy submarine or other technically feasible causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article2002813.ece |first=Adam |last=Sage |title=Spy submarine is blamed for sinking trawler in war games |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=23 February 2009 | location=London | work=The Times}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such the relatives of the dead sailors and the owner of the ship have not received any compensations.

While other causes for the ship's loss are possible, this accident and others with a clearer attribution to nuclear submarines suggest that submarines operating in fishing zones represent a danger to fishing trawlers who when "catching" a submarine may be at significant risk of being pulled under. The [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]] indicates that accidents with submarines may have accounted for the loss of more than 20 motorized fishing vessels since 1970 with the loss of over 150 sailors and demands better communication between the military and the civilian authorities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3937">A '''Carthaginian peace''' is the imposition of a very brutal "peace" achieved by completely crushing the enemy. The term derives from the peace imposed on [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] by [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. After the [[Second Punic War]], Carthage lost all its colonies, was forced to demilitarize and pay a constant tribute to Rome and could enter war only with Rome's permission. At the end of the [[Third Punic War]], the Romans systematically burned Carthage to the ground and enslaved its population.

==Origin==
The term refers to the outcome of a series of wars between Rome and the [[Phoenicia]]n city of Carthage, known as the [[Punic Wars]]. The two empires fought three separate wars against each other, beginning in 264 BC and ending in 146 BC.

At the end of the [[Third Punic War]], the Romans laid siege to [[Carthage]]. When they took the city, they killed most of the inhabitants, sold the rest into [[slavery]], and destroyed the entire city. There is no ancient evidence for modern accounts that the Romans [[salting the earth|sowed the ground with salt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ridley|first1=R.T.|title=To Be Taken with a Pinch of Salt: The Destruction of Carthage|journal=Classical Philology|volume=81|issue=2|pages=140|year=1986|jstor=269786|doi=10.1086/366973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, a Carthaginian peace can refer to any brutal peace treaty demanding total subjugation of the defeated side.

==Modern use==
Modern use of the term is often extended to any peace settlement in which the peace terms are overly harsh and designed to accentuate and perpetuate the inferiority of the loser. Thus, after [[World War I]], many (the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] among them&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, John Maynard. ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace''. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;) described the [[Treaty of Versailles]] as a "Carthaginian Peace."

The [[Morgenthau Plan]] put forward after [[World War II]] has also been described as a Carthaginian peace, as it advocated the deindustrialization of Germany. It was intended to severely curb the influence of German power in the region and to prevent its remilitarization, as had occurred after World War I ([[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]]).  The Morgenthau Plan was dropped in favor of the [[Marshall Plan]] (1948–1952), which entailed the rebuilding of Western European infrastructure, particularly in West Germany. 

General [[Lucius D. Clay]], a deputy to general [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and, in 1945, [[Military Governor of the U.S. Occupation Zone in Germany]], would later remark that "there was no doubt that [[JCS 1067]] contemplated the Carthaginian peace which dominated our operations in Germany during the early months of occupation. This is while the US was following the Morgenthau Plan."&lt;ref&gt;A Nation at War in an Era of Strategic Change, p.129 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=3l7U7Mgmy80C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=there+was+no+doubt+that+JCS+1067+contemplated+the+Carthaginian+peace+which+dominated+our+operations+in+Germany+during+the+early+months+of+occupation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=0DA1V0w7WA&amp;sig=dSd7upp-P4OlW28bBQKnsKXbBxk&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result#PPA129,M1 Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt; Clay would later replace Eisenhower as governor and as commander-in-chief in Europe. The Marshall Plan was favored as a revival of the West German economy was considered to be necessary for the recovery of the economy of Europe. West Germany was regarded as a key bulwark against the Eastern Bloc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2681">A '''cellular microarray''' (or cell microarray) is a [[laboratory]] tool that allows for the [[multiplex (assay)|multiplex]] interrogation of living [[cell (biology)|cells]] on the surface of a solid support.  The support, sometimes called a "chip", is spotted with varying materials, such as [[antibodies]], [[proteins]], or [[lipids]], which can interact with the cells, leading to their capture on specific spots.  Combinations of different materials can be spotted in a given area, allowing not only cellular capture, when a specific interaction exists, but also the triggering of a cellular response, change in [[phenotype]], or detection of a response from the cell, such as a specific [[secretion|secreted]] factor.

There are a large number of types of cellular microarrays:

# [[Reverse transfection]] cell microarrays. David M. Sabatini's laboratory developed reverse-transfection cell microarrays at the [[Whitehead Institute]], publishing their work in 2001.
# [[PMHC Cellular Microarrays]].  This type of microarray were developed by Daniel Chen, Yoav Soen, Dan Kraft, Patrick Brown and Mark Davis at [[Stanford University Medical Center]].

'''Crimean Tom''' (also known as '''Tom''' or '''Sevastopol Tom''') was a cat noted for his association with the British Army during the [[Crimean War]].  Found by Lieutenant William Gair in [[Sevastopol]] after a year-long siege, he is said to have led British forces to valuable caches of hidden supplies that helped ease starvation among the troops.  Gair brought Tom back to England after the war but the cat died soon afterwards.  He was stuffed and presented to the [[Royal United Services Institute]]. A cat bought in a [[flea market]] in the 1950s resides in the collection of the [[National Army Museum]] and is sometimes described as being Tom, but there is no proof it is the same cat.

== Life ==
During the [[Crimean War]] British and French forces captured [[Sevastopol]] from the Russians on 9 September 1855 after an [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)|almost year-long siege]].  Lieutenant William Gair of the [[6th Dragoon Guards]], who was seconded to the [[Royal Army Service Corps|Field Train Department]] as a [[Commissariat|deputy assistant commissary]], led patrols to search the cellars of buildings for supplies.&lt;ref name=grey&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Stephen|title=Those Terrible Grey Horses: An Illustrated History of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781472813497|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bm-ICwAAQBAJ|accessdate=14 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nam&gt;{{cite web|title=Stuffed tabby cat 'Crimean Tom', 1855|url=https://collection.nam.ac.uk/detail.php?acc=1958-02-27-1|website=National Army Museum|accessdate=14 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gair noticed a cat, covered in dust and grime, that was sitting on top of a pile of rubbish between two injured people.  The cat, unperturbed by the surrounding commotion, allowed himself to be picked up by Gair.&lt;ref name=grey/&gt;  The cat, estimated to have been 8 years old when found, had survived within the city throughout the siege.&lt;ref name="grey" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nam/&gt;

Gair took the cat back to his quarters and he lived and ate with a group of British officers who initially named him ''Tom'' and later ''Crimean Tom'' or ''Sevastopol Tom''.&lt;ref name=grey/&gt;  The occupying armies were struggling to find supplies, especially of food, in a city much-deprived by the year-long siege.  It is said that the officers noticed how fat Tom was getting and realised he must have been feeding off a good supply of mice nearby.  Knowing that the mice may themselves have been feeding off hidden Russian supplies, they followed Tom to an area cut off by rubble.&lt;ref name=super&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Ashley|title=Super Cats: True Tales of Extraordinary Felines|date=2017|publisher=Summersdale Publishers Limited|isbn=9781786851277|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jq5IDgAAQBAJ|accessdate=14 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, they found a storeroom with food supplies that helped to save British and French soldiers from starvation.&lt;ref name="grey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet England's most heroic cats|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36987284|accessdate=14 February 2018|work=BBC News|date=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tom later led the officers to several smaller caches of supplies near the city docks.&lt;ref name=grey/&gt;  After the war ended Gair brought Tom back with him to England to keep as a pet but the cat died on 31 December 1856.&lt;ref name=nam/&gt;

Gair had Tom stuffed and presented to the [[Royal United Services Institution]].  A stuffed cat purchased at the [[Portobello Road]] market by Lady [[Faith Compton Mackenzie]] in the 1950s was identified as Crimean Tom but there is no proof it is the same cat. It was donated to the  [[National Army Museum]] in 1958 and is on display there; however, they have not been able to confirm whether or not this is Crimean Tom.&lt;ref name=nam/&gt;  

Tom has popularly been identified as the cat asleep on a table next to a wood stove in the oil painting ''A Welcome Arrival, 1855'' by [[John Dalbiac Luard]], an 1857 work depicting British officers opening packages sent from home. It has been suggested that Gair is the red-coated figure at the left of the piece. The National Army Museum write, however, that "there is no evidence to substantiate any of these claims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Welcome Arrival, 1855 (c), John D'Albiac Luard|url=http://prints.national-army-museum.ac.uk/image/378919/john-dalbiac-luard-a-welcome-arrival-1855-c|website=National Army Museum|accessdate=14 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Céline Émilie Seurre''', known as '''Cécile Sorel''' or the '''Comtesse de Ségur''', by marriage (7 September 1873 in [[Paris]] – 3 September 1966 in [[Trouville-sur-Mer]]) was a French comic actress. She enjoyed great popularity and was known for her extravagant costumes.

==Biography==
She was attracted to the theater at an early age, studying with [[Louis-Arsène Delaunay]] and Marie Favart. In 1899, she began her career at the [[Théâtre de l'Odéon|Odéon]] and then, in 1901, became a member of the [[Comédie-Française]], where she specialized in playing a [[stock character]] known as the "grande coquette". She was especially well known for her portrayal of Célimène in ''[[The Misanthrope]]''. In 1904, she became the 339th "[[Sociétaires of the Comédie-Française|Sociétaire de la Comédie-Française]]" and remained with the theater until 1933.

Although long engaged to [[Whitney Warren]], an American architect who was related to the [[Vanderbilts]], she eventually married the Comte de Ségur-Lamoignon, great grandson of the famous [[Countess of Ségur|Comtesse de Ségur]], who acted under the name [[Guillaume de Sax]]. They were sometimes mocked as "beauty and the beast" and were separated after fifteen years, but she kept the title of "Comtesse" for the rest of her life.

In 1909, she had the starring role in ''[[La Tosca (1909 film)|La Tosca]]'', a film by [[André Calmettes]] and [[Charles Le Bargy]]. Her next film role did not come until 1937, when she played an aged courtesan in ''[[Pearls of the Crown]]'' by [[Sacha Guitry]]. Four years later, she essentially played herself in a sketch comedy called ''Les Petits riens'', written by and starring [[Yves Mirande]]. In 1944, she barely escaped the bombing that destroyed the Théâtre-Français in [[Rouen]].

In 1950, she underwent a "conversion" and, following the lead of the original Comtesse de Ségur, took her vows as a [[Secular Franciscan Order|Third-order Franciscan]]. She adopted the name "Soeur Cécile de l'Enfant-Jésus" and devoted her time to writing. A television documentary of her career was produced in 1965. She died of complications from a fractured hip, suffered in a fall at her rented château on the French coast, and was buried in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]].

Her likeness appears in a [[fresco]] by [[Charles Hoffbauer]] on the ceiling of the [[cupola]] at the [[Château d'Artigny]] in [[Montbazon]], once owned by [[François Coty]]. A college in the town of [[Mériel]] is named after her.

[[File:Inferno Canto 29, Gustave Dorè.jpg|thumb|The highly [[Program music|programmatic]] themes depict the souls of Hell wailing in anguish.]]
'''''Après une lecture du Dante: Fantasia quasi Sonata''''' (French for ''After a Reading of Dante: Fantasia quasi Sonata''; also known as the '''''Dante'' Sonata''') is a [[piano sonata]] in one [[Movement (music)|movement]], completed by Hungarian composer [[Franz Liszt]] in 1849. It was first published in 1856 as part of the second volume of his ''[[Années de pèlerinage]]'' (''Years of Pilgrimage''). This work of [[program music]] was inspired by the reading of [[Dante Alighieri]]'s most famous [[Epic poetry|epic poem]], the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.

== Background ==
[[File:Dante Sonata 1.png|thumb|300px|Introduction]]
The ''Dante'' Sonata was originally a small piece entitled ''Fragment after Dante'', consisting of two thematically related [[Movement (music)|movements]], which Liszt composed in the late 1830s.&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Hamilton|title=Liszt: Sonata in B Minor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bska8j2Hbm0C|year=1996|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-46963-5|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave the first public performance in Vienna, during November 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Vienna: Musical History of the Fourth Quarter of 1839 |newspaper=General Musical Newspapers |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=91–92 |date=January 1840 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he settled in [[Weimar]] in 1849, he revised the work along with others in the volume, and gave it its present title derived from [[Victor Hugo]]'s own work of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etudes-litteraires.com/hugo.php |title=Les Voix intérieures (1837), XXVII |accessdate=2007-12-28 |author=Hugo, Victor |date=1836-08-06 |work=Études littéraires |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in 1858 as part of ''[[Années de pèlerinage]]''.&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;

== Composition ==
[[File:Dante Sonata 3.png|thumb|300px|The second subject is a derivation of the first]]

The piece is divided into two main subjects. The first, a chromatic theme in [[D minor]], typifies the wailing of souls in Hell. D minor is a common key for music relating to death, as evidenced by Liszt's [[Totentanz (Liszt)|''Totentanz'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{IMSLP|work=Totentanz, S.126 (Liszt, Franz)|cname=''Totentanz''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the statue scene of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.  The first theme also heavily uses the [[Tritone]] (augmented 4th or diminished 5th); this interval was known as the Devil's interval (or "Devil in music") and further reinforces the hellish imagery. The second theme is a [[Beatification|beatific]] chorale in [[F-sharp major]], derived from the first, which represents the joy of those in Heaven.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Walker (musicologist)|title=Franz Liszt: The Virtuoso Years (1811–1847)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lCw4cxHmpgYC|year=1987|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=0-8014-9421-4|pages=275–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key is also symbolic here, being the signature for other uplifting works of Liszt's, including ''Benediction of God in Solitude'' (part of ''[[Harmonies poétiques et religieuses]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{IMSLP|work=Harmonies poétiques et religieuses III, S.173 (Liszt, Franz)|cname=''Benediction of God in Solitude''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Les Jeux d'eaux à la Villa d'Este'' (''Années de pèlerinage'', Vol. 3, No. 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piano.ru/scores/liszt/gs3-04.pdf |title=''Les Jeux d'eaux à la Villa d'Este'' sheet music |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-12-28 |author=Liszt, Franz |work=Piano.ru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210214617/http://www.piano.ru/scores/liszt/gs3-04.pdf |archivedate=December 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The secondary theme may also represent [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]], as it is interspersed within chromatic areas, similar to the character's appearances in hell. The piece ends with a rapid chromatic octave section that when played at speed seems to split into three distinct themes, reflecting the three heads of Satan in Dante's [[Inferno (Dante)|''Inferno'']].

{{Campaignbox Bahraini uprising}}
{{Contains Arabic text}}

'''Abdulredha Mohamed Hasan Buhmaid''' (or ''Buhamaid'', {{lang-ar|عبدالرضا محمد حسن بوحميد}}) was a 28-year-old [[Bahrain]]i protester shot by a live [[bullet]] in the head on 18 February 2011. He died in hospital three days later, the seventh death in the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|Bahraini uprising]].

Buhmaid was among a group of protesters who on 18 February marched toward the [[Pearl Roundabout]] following the funeral procession of protester [[Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima]], who was killed four days earlier. When the protesters neared Pearl Roundabout, the [[Bahrain Defense Force|army]] opened fire. Buhmaid collapsed to the ground, and blood poured from his head after it was [[Ballistic trauma|hit by a bullet]]. The army opened fire twice more. Protesters regrouped after each round of shooting. [[Public Security Forces|Riot police]] finally intervened and dispersed protesters. Over one hundred protesters were injured, some seriously. Buhmaid was taken to [[Salmaniya hospital]] where attempts to revive him failed over the course of three days. He died on the afternoon of 21 February.

Several witnesses including journalists and medics accused authorities of shooting directly at protesters, preventing some ambulances from reaching the site and firing at others. The [[Cabinet of Bahrain|government]] however, denied those statements. It stated that [[warning shot]]s were fired in the air and accused protesters of faking injuries. An investigation by a [[Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry|government-appointed commission of inquiry]] blamed the army for Buhmaid's death. The incident marked the first time that the [[Royal Bahraini Army]] was used to confront civilians, and at the time was considered "the bloodiest" incident since protests erupted.

Following the incident, the government offered dialogue which the opposition said they will only take part in after the withdrawal of the army. The [[General Federation of Workers Trade Unions in Bahrain|general labor union]] called for a general strike. Internationally, the attack on protesters was condemned by [[Barack Obama]] and [[Human Rights Watch]]. [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative]] of European Union expressed her deep concerns and called for restrain and immediate dialogue. Britain revoked over forty arms licenses to Bahrain after an earlier announcement that it would review them and [[President of Germany|German president]] canceled a planned visit to the country. Buhmaid is remembered by the [[Opposition (Bahrain)|opposition]] as a [[martyr]], leader and symbol of [[Nonviolent resistance|peacefulness]].

'''Denis Georges Waxin '''(born June 26, 1968 in [[Loos, Nord|Loos, Nord Department]]) is a [[France|French]] [[pedophile]] and [[serial killer]]. Between 1985 and 1999, in Lille and its suburbs, he raped and killed three girls and raped two boys and another girl. In November 2003, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 29-year lock-in period.

== Biography ==
Denis Waxin was born on June 26, 1968 in the Nord, spending his childhood in [[Wattignies]]. He never saw his parents talking to each other. His mother Marie-Jeanne was hard-working and decent.&lt;ref name="voixdunord"&gt;[http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/region/a-lille-egalement-un-serial-killer-demasque-des-ia19b0n1444793 "Also in Lille, a serial killer unmasked years after his crimes"] Article by Lakhdar Belaid published on July 29, 2013 in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Voix_du_Nord La Voix du Nord]''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, his father was very strict, interested only in trifecta and games of chance, and never talked to Denis or his other 4 children. His family was modest, and his parents often left him in silence and isolation, without tenderness and affecition. His older brother Dominique was his only confidant, defender and sole source of sweetness.&lt;ref name="faitesentrer"&gt;"Denis Waxin, The Predator" April 21, 2009 and March 27, 2011 in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faites_entrer_l%27accus%C3%A9 Let the accused enter]'' presented by [//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christophe_Hondelatte Christophe Hondelatte] sur [//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_2 France 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Dominique left the family home and Denis fell into depression. Every day he would walk miles in the streets alone for hours. He obtained a professional degree in carpentry, later doing his military service in [[Germany]]. During military leave, he had a relationship with an older woman. Their relationship ended in the late summer of 1990 when he finished his military service. Eventually he got married and lived in Moulins. The pair did not have a child, and he called his wife "mom". He was described as a good husband, helpful and charming.

He got a job in the [[filling station]] of [[Auchan]] in [[Villeneuve-d'Ascq]].&lt;ref name="télég"&gt;[http://www.letelegramme.fr/ar/viewarticle1024.php?aaaammjj=19990716&amp;article=19990716-infoge2&amp;type=ar « infoge2.htm »] Article published on July 16, 1999 in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_T%C3%A9l%C3%A9gramme Le Télégramme]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="libé2"&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/societe/1999/07/22/wendy-un-regard-d-enfant-pour-confondre-waxin-l-homme-a-avoue-le-meurtre-de-trois-fillettes-depuis-1_279399 "Wendy, a child's look to confuse Waxin.

One night, he shot all the bullets from the alarm gun charger onto an eyeglass thief. He ended up being fired for threatening to set the station on fire because he was annoyed by a remark made to him by his boss.

His father died in 2002.

== Events and the investigation ==
On November 22, 1985 at the end of the afternoon, at the biscuit district in Lille, 7-year-old Nathalie Hoareau was sent by her mother to buy cigarettes and bread. Waxin approached her and offered to show her his shack. She followed him to a wasteland in the rue de Faubourg Arras (RD 549), where he raped her, tried to strangle her with a candy necklace she wore around her neck before stabbing her twice in the heart. Nathalie's mother reported her disappearance to the police at 6:30 PM. Her body, the lower part of which was bare, was found in the evening in a bush by two policemen. Near her, they found the packets of cigarettes she had bought and the shopping list on which the shopkeeper had written a message for her mother. A trace of sperm was found, but the rain had altered it, making it impossible to establish a [[DNA profiling|genetic profile]].

On October 8, 1990 in the Austerlitz in Wazemmes, Cathy Monchaux, 9 years old, was playing in the garden of her residence.&lt;ref name="huma"&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/node/10991 "Little Cathy has been murdered"] Article published on October 10, 1990 in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Humanit%C3%A9 L'Humanité]''&lt;/ref&gt; At 8 PM, her father Roger called her to come back home. Waxin then approached her and offered to buy candy, taking her to an old football field turned into a wasteland on Victor-Hugo boulevard. He raped then stabbed her fourteen times because she tried to escape. When Cathy did not return, her father and older sister, Valérie, went out looking for her. Unsuccessful, her father informed the police at 9 PM. A day later, a man walking his dog found Cathy's naked body.

On July 23, 1992 at the end of the afternoon on Georges-Mandel street in Moulins, Nadjia Thebib, 4 years old, was playing with other children at the foot of a [[HLM]] building where her grandmother Meriem lived on the ground floor. Her parents had just separated. Waxin went in the direction of [[Ronchin]]. He carried her in his arms, and since she was calm, her family supposed that he was an uncle of Nadjia. Anissa, Nadjia's aunt, pursued him in the streets, but she stumbled and lost sight of him. Nadjia's mother Nina went out looking for her with the help of the other family members. She reported the abduction to the police at 8 PM. Anissa described the kidnapper's outfit: red T-shirt, sneakers with white stripes and white sweatpants with red stripes. A [[facial composite]] was produced and broadcast. Meanwhile, Waxin raped Nadjia, stabbing her in the neck and choking her with a plastic bag. On July 29, 1992 at the beginning of the afternoon, in a vacant lot in Ronchin, three boys found Nadjia's body lying on its right side, under a tarpaulin in a hole between the suburbs. Her clothes were folded beneath her. The medical examiner stated that she had been killed a few hours after her abduction. On one of her clothes trace of sperm was found, and this allowed the authorities to establish a DNA profile.

The investigators were certain that the perpetrator lived in Lille or its suburbs, so well as to know the deserted places and move so quickly and discreetly when abducting a child.

In November and December 1993 Waxin raped two boys aged 7 and 10 in Moulins and Lambersart.&lt;ref name="libé3"&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/societe/1999/10/16/denis-waxin-soupconne-de-deux-autres-viols_286419 «Denis Waxin suspected of two other rapes»] Article published on October 16, 1999 in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lib%C3%A9ration_(journal) Libération]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obs"&gt;[http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20020531.OBS6140/perpetuite-pour-le-violeur-meurtrier-d-enfants.html "Perpetuity for the murderous rapist of children"] Article published on May 31, 2002 in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Obs Le Nouvel observateur]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Waxin was arrested for trying to steal cutlery from a store with his wife.

On January 6, 1999 on Jean-Jaurès street in Moulins, 6-year-old Wendy, her older sister and brother collected yellow coins at the food at the residence where they lived. After a while, her brother and sister decided to separate to collect  more efficiently. Wendy remained alone in asking people who came in and out of the residence entrance, while her brother and sister collected in the residence door to door. Wendy asked Waxin, who was walking down the street. He said he had none on him, but that he had some at home. After checking that no one else is around, he took Wendy by hand and pulled her to the side of the street. They walked for miles. Waxin replied that they have almost arrived each time Wendy asked him if it is far from home. He told her that it is a shortcut and that it took them to an abandoned factory in [[Fives, Nord|Fives]]. She resisted when he began to undress her, but he threatened her with an electric baton, saying that he had already killed other little girls. She no longer protested, letting Waxin undress and rape her. She calmly put her clothes back on when he finished. She left but Waxin followed her, telling her that is watching and he will come back if she speaks to the police. She walked towards her home and found out that she had disappeared. A motorist saw her crying, and carried her to the police station.

Wendy's good memory made it possible to create a facial composite. She said that he was wearing a green jacket with a tringle in the back. A few days later, while Wendy was looking out the window, she saw Waxin on the sidewalk in front of the residence, looking at her and smiling. The police, informed a few days later, monitored the building entrance. They noticed a man matching the facial composite. They questioned him, and he claimed that he is a marginal resident in a home near Wendy. The authorities printed on one sheet six anthropometric photos: that of the suspect, and those of five men resembling him. They went to Wendy's house and asked her if she could recognize her attacker among the pictures. She referred to Waxin's photo, who was not considered a suspect. Interlocated, the investigators asked her again and said its him. For them, Waxin was just a small shoplifter, and without a confession, they could not prosecute him.

== Confessions and indictment ==
On January 20, 1999, Waxin went to the convocation. He was very nervous. The inspectors were impressed by the resemblance to the facial composite. They barely told him the reason for his summoning when he confessed that it is him, then refused to speak further. When he was lined up behind the [[beam splitter]], Wendy formally recognized him. During the search of Waxin's home, the police found in his room the jacket corresponding to Wendy's description. In a pocket of the jacket, authorities found a police baton. On January 28, 1999, Waxin was indicted for rape and unlawful confinement of children under 15.&lt;ref name="libé1"&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/societe/1999/07/21/lille-waxin-avoue-avoir-tue-deux-autres-enfants_278755 "Lille: Waxin admits to killing two more children"] Article published on July 21, 1999 in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lib%C3%A9ration_(journal) Libération]''&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently incarcerated in Loos Prison.

Waxin's DNA profile was compared to that of Nadjia Thebib's aggressor, resulting in an identical match. On July 12, 1999, Waxin was indicted for kidnappy followed by death and rape, accompanied or followed by acts of torture and barbarity on Nadjia. He was extracted from his cell and questioned while in custody. He admitted to having raped, strangled and suffocated Nadjia. He refused to sign his confession and speak further. He declared that he wanted to see the investigating judge to tell him about the murders of the 3 girls.

On July 13, 1999, in the office of Christophe Ingrain, the investigating judge, Waxin admitted to murdering Nadjia, Cathy Monchaux and Nathalie Hoareau. He claimed to have done this to avenge a rape of which he was victim when he was 12 years old in a cabin in the woods by a homeless man, and that he drank alcohol before committing rape. On July 20, 1999, he was indicted for kidnapping followed by death and rape preceded, accompanied or followed by torture or acts of barbarity on Nathalie and Cathy.

On July 20, 1999, Waxin wrote a letter to the investigating judge in which he confirmed the confessions made in the office by describing the crimes more precisely. He claimed to have killed the girls so that they won't give birth to a monster like the one who raped them. He confessed to having committed three more rapes on girls, whom he did not kill because they "were kind", also admitting to the rapes of two boys in 1993. No trace of the rapes of the other three girls were found in the police files.

== Trial and sentence ==
In May 2002, the trial of Denis Waxin began at a [[cour d'assises]] in Nord and [[Douai]], for the murders and rapes  preceded by torture or acts of barbarity on Nadjia and Cathy, and for the rapes on the 2 boys and on Wendy. The defense of Waxin was provided by lawyer Jean-Yves Moyart. Experts described Waxin as a perverted egocentric whose "sexualized hatred was from infancy".

On May 31, 2002, Denis Waxin was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 30-year lock-in period.&lt;ref name="lacroix"&gt;[http://www.la-croix.com/Archives/2002-09-10/JUSTICE-_NP_-2002-09-10-165229 « Justice »] Article publié le 10 septembre 2002 dans ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Croix La Croix]''&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to appeal the decision.

On September 9, 2002, the trial of Denis Waxin for the rape and murder of Nathalie Hoareau began at a cour d'assises of Nord in Douai, because he was 17 years old during these events. Sébastien Degardin was the lawyer for Hoareau's family.

In September 2002, Waxin was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He tried to appeal this decision as well.

In 2003, Waxin's appeal trial for the Hoareau murder took place at cour d'assises [[Pas-de-Calais]] in [[Saint-Omer]].

He was again sentenced to 20 years in prison.

In 2003, Denis Waxin's appeal trial began at the Pas-de-Calais Assize Court in Saint-Omer. Sobbing, he finally apologized for what he did.

In November 2003, Denis Waxin was sentenced to life with a 29-year lock-in period.

[[File:Pregnancy, for female shadow.png|thumb]]
For '''[[pregnancy|pregnant]]''' women with '''[[diabetes mellitus]]''' some particular challenges exist for both mother and child. If the woman has diabetes as an [[intercurrent disease in pregnancy]], it can cause [[preterm birth|early labor]], [[birth defect]]s, and larger then average infants.

Planning in advance is emphasized if one wants to become pregnant and has [[type 1 diabetes mellitus]] or [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]]. Stringent blood glucose control is needed before [[pregnancy]].

==Physiology==
During a normal pregnancy, many [[Maternal physiological changes in pregnancy|maternal physiological changes]] occur and there is an increase in insulin needs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article-pdf/4/6/904/1998089/040904.pdf|title=Insulin in Obstetrics: a main parameter in the management of pregnancy|last=|first=|date=1998|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to increased hormonal secretions that regulate [[blood]] [[glucose]] levels, glucose-'drain' to the [[fetus]], slowed emptying of the [[stomach]], increased excretion of glucose by the [[kidney]]s and resistance of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s to [[insulin]].

==Risks for the child==
The risks of maternal diabetes to the developing fetus include [[miscarriage]], growth restriction, growth acceleration, fetal obesity ([[macrosomia]]), mild neurological deficits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ornoy A, Wolf A, Ratzon N, Greenbaum C, Dulitzky M |title=Neurodevelopmental outcome at early school age of children born to mothers with gestational diabetes |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=F10–4 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10375355 |pmc=1720965 |doi= 10.1136/fn.81.1.F10|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[polyhydramnios]] and [[birth defects]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}In some studies 4% to 11% of infants born to type 1 diabetic women had defects compared to 1.2% to 2.1% of infants born in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pumping Insulin|last=Walsh|first=John|publisher=Torrey Pines Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1-884804-86-1|location=Sand Diego, California|pages=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;The cause is, e.g., [[oxidative stress]], by activating [[protein kinase C]]&lt;ref name="gareskog"&gt;[http://publications.uu.se/theses/spikblad.xsql?dbid=7203 Author: Gäreskog, Mattias Title: Teratogenicity Involved in Experimental Diabetic Pregnancy]&lt;/ref&gt; that leads to [[apoptosis]] of some cells.&lt;ref name="gareskog" /&gt; A hyperglycemic maternal environment has also been associated with neonates that are at greater risk for development of negative health outcomes such as future obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calkins|first=Kara|author2=Sherin Devaskar |title=Fetal Origins of Adult Disease|journal=Curr Probl Pediatr Adolesc Health Care|year=2011|pages=158–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

During the first trimester, besides increased birth defect risks, having a miscarriage is also increased due to abnormal development in the early stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jpma.org.pk/supplement_details.php?article_id=275|title=First Trimester complications in pregnancy with diabetes|last=|first=|date=September 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

When blood glucose is not controlled, shortly after birth, the infant's lungs may be under developed and can cause respiratory problems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hyperglycemia can occur after birth if the mother's blood sugar was high close to the time of delivery, which causes the baby to produces extra insulin of its own. 

Mild neurological and cognitive deficits in offspring — including increased symptoms of [[ADHD]], impaired fine and gross motor skills, and impaired explicit memory performance — have been linked to pregestational type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nomura Y, Marks DJ, Grossman B, Yoon M, Loudon H, Stone J, Halperin JM |title=Exposure to Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Low Socioeconomic Status: Effects on Neurocognitive Development and Risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Offspring |journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine |volume= 166|issue= 4|pages= 337–43|date=January 2012 |pmid=22213602 |pmc=5959273 |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.784 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ornoy A, Ratzon N, Greenbaum C, Wolf A, Dulitzky M |title=School-age children born to diabetic mothers and to mothers with gestational diabetes exhibit a high rate of inattention and fine and gross motor impairment |journal=Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism : JPEM |volume=14 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=681–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11393563 |doi= 10.1515/jpem.2001.14.s1.681|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DeBoer T, Wewerka S, Bauer PJ, Georgieff MK, Nelson CA |title=Explicit memory performance in infants of diabetic mothers at 1 year of age |journal=Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology |volume=47 |issue=8 |pages=525–31 |date=August 2005 |pmid=16108452 |pmc=2829746 |doi= 10.1017/s0012162205001039|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prenatal iron deficiency has been suggested as a possible mechanism for these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Georgieff MK |title=The effect of maternal diabetes during pregnancy on the neurodevelopment of offspring |journal=Minnesota Medicine |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=44–7 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16669433 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birth defects are not currently an identified risk for the child of women with [[gestational diabetes]], since those primarily occur in the latter part of pregnancy, where vital organs already have taken their most essential shape.

==Importance of blood glucose level during pregnancy==
[[High blood sugar]] levels are harmful to the mother and her fetus. Experts advise diabetics to maintain [[blood sugar level]] close to normal range for 2 to 3 months before planning for pregnancy. Managing blood sugar close to normal before and during pregnancy helps to protect the health of mother and the baby.

[[Insulin]] may be needed for type 2 diabetics instead of oral [[diabetes medication]]. Extra insulin may be needed for type 1 diabetics during pregnancy. Doctors may advise to check blood sugar more often to maintain near-normal blood sugar levels.

==Diabetes pregnancy management==
Blood glucose levels in pregnant woman should be regulated as strictly as possible. Higher levels of glucose early in pregnancy are associated with teratogenic effects on the developing fetus.&lt;ref&gt;J Obstet Gynaecol Can 2007;29(11):927–934 http://sogc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/guiJOGC200CPG0711.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Cochrane review]] published in 2016 was designed to find out the most effective blood sugar range to guide treatment for women who develop gestational diabetes mellitus in their pregnancy. The review concluded that quality scientific evidence is not yet available to determine the best blood sugar range for improving health for pregnant women with diabetes and their babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martis|first1=R|last2=Brown|first2=J|last3=Alsweiler|first3=J|last4=Crawford|first4=T|last5=Crowther|first5=CA|date=2016|title=Different intensities of glycaemic control for women with gestational diabetes mellitus|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=4|page=CD011624|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011624.pub2|pmid=27055233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first weeks of pregnancy less insulin is required due to tight blood sugar control as well as the extra glucose needed for the growing fetus.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Think like a Pancreas|last=Scheiner|first=Gary|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2004|isbn=978-156924-436-4|location=|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;At this time [[Basal rate|basal]] and [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]] insulin may need to be reduced to prevent [[hypoglycemia]]. Frequent testing of blood sugar levels is recommended to maintain control. As the fetus grows and weight is gained through out the pregnancy, the body produces more hormones which may cause insulin resistance and the need for more insulin.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Think like a Pancreas|last=Scheiner|first=Gary|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2004|isbn=978-156924-436-4|location=|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time it is important for blood sugar levels to remain in range as the baby will produce more of its own insulin to cover its mother's higher blood sugar level which can cause fetal [[macrosomia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/infant-diabetic-mother|title=Infant of Diabetic Mother|last=|first=|date=2014-08-24|website=Children's Hospital of Philadelphia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During delivery, which is equivalent to exercise, insulin needs to be reduced again or hyperglycemia can occur. After the baby is delivered and the days following, there are no more hormones from the placenta which demanded more insulin, therefore insulin demand is decreased and gradually returns to normal requirements.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pumping Insulin|last=Walsh|first=John|publisher=Torrey Pines Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1-884804-86-1|location=San Diego, California|pages=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diabetes mellitus may be effectively managed by appropriate meal planning, increased physical activity and properly-instituted insulin treatment.  Some tips for controlling diabetes in pregnancy include:

* Meals – Cut down sweets, eats three small meals and one to three snacks a day, maintain proper mealtimes, and include balanced fiber intake in the form of fruits, vegetables and whole-grains.
* Increased physical activity - walking, swimming/aquaerobics, etc.
* Monitor blood sugar level frequently, doctors may ask to check the blood glucose more often than usual.
* The blood sugar level should be below 95&amp;nbsp;mg/dl (5.3&amp;nbsp;mmol/l) on awakening, below 140&amp;nbsp;mg/dl (7.8&amp;nbsp;mmol/l) one hour after a meal and below 120&amp;nbsp;mg/dl (6.7&amp;nbsp;mmol/l) two hours after a meal.
* Each time when checking the blood sugar level, keep a proper record of the results and present to the health care team for evaluation and modification of the treatment. If blood sugar levels are above targets, a perinatal diabetes management team may suggest ways to achieve targets.
* Many may need extra insulin during pregnancy to reach their blood sugar target. Insulin is not harmful for the baby.

==Breast feeding==
[[Breast feeding]] is good for the child even with a mother with diabetes mellitus. Some women wonder whether breast feeding is recommended after they have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Breast feeding is recommended for most babies, including when mothers may be diabetic.  In fact, the child’s risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus later in life may be lower if the baby was breast-fed.  It also helps the child to maintain a healthy body weight during infancy. However, the [[breastmilk]] of mothers with diabetes has been demonstrated to have a different composition than that of non-diabetic mothers, containing elevated levels of glucose and insulin and decreased [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]].&lt;ref name=Rodekamp&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rodekamp E, Harder T, Kohlhoff R, Dudenhausen JW, Plagemann A |title=Impact of breast-feeding on psychomotor and neuropsychological development in children of diabetic mothers: role of the late neonatal period |journal=Journal of Perinatal Medicine |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=490–6 |year=2006 |pmid=17140300 |doi=10.1515/JPM.2006.095 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although benefits of breast-feeding for the children of diabetic mothers have been documented, ingestion of diabetic breast milk has also been linked to delayed language development on a dose-dependent basis.&lt;ref name=Rodekamp/&gt;

In some cases, pregnant women with diabetes may be encouraged to express and store their [[colostrum]] during pregnancy, in case their blood sugar is too low for feeding the baby breast milk after birth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=East|first=Christine E.|last2=Dolan|first2=Willie J.|last3=Forster|first3=Della A.|date=2014-07-30|title=Antenatal breast milk expression by women with diabetes for improving infant outcomes|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:336306/UQ336306_OA.pdf|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=7|pages=CD010408|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010408.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=25074749|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence on the safety or potential benefits when pregnant women with diabetes express and store breast milk prior to the baby's birth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Classification==
The White classification, named after [[Priscilla White (physician)|Priscilla White]]&lt;ref name="PWhite"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15396063 | volume=7 | issue=5 | title=Pregnancy complicating diabetes |date=November 1949 | author=White P | journal=Am. J. Med. | pages=609–16 | doi=10.1016/0002-9343(49)90382-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; who pioneered research on the effect of diabetes types on perinatal outcome, is widely used to assess maternal and fetal risk. It distinguishes between gestational diabetes (type A) and diabetes that existed before pregnancy (pregestational diabetes). These two groups are further subdivided according to their associated risks and management.&lt;ref name="OBSTETRICS"&gt;Gabbe S.G., Niebyl J.R., Simpson J.L. OBSTETRICS: Normal and Problem Pregnancies. Fourth edition. Churchill Livingstone, New York, 2002. {{ISBN|0-443-06572-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 2 classes of gestational diabetes (diabetes which began during pregnancy): 
* Class A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: gestational diabetes; diet controlled
* Class A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: gestational diabetes; medication controlled

The second group of diabetes which existed before pregnancy can be split up into these classes:
* Class B: onset at age 20 or older or with duration of less than 10 years
* Class C: onset at age 10-19 or duration of 10–19 years
* Class D: onset before age 10 or duration greater than 20 years
* Class E: overt diabetes mellitus with calcified pelvic vessels
* Class F: [[diabetic nephropathy]]
* Class R: proliferative [[retinopathy]]
* Class RF: [[retinopathy]] and [[nephropathy]]
* Class H: [[ischemic heart disease]]
* Class T: prior kidney transplant
An early age of onset or long-standing disease comes with greater risks, hence the first three subtypes.

'''Directed panspermia''' is the deliberate transport of microorganisms in space to be used as [[introduced species]] on lifeless but [[Planetary habitability|habitable]] [[astronomical object]]s.

Historically, Shklovskii and Sagan (1966) and Crick and Orgel (1973) hypothesized that [[life]] on the Earth may have been seeded deliberately by other civilizations. Conversely, Mautner and Matloff (1979) and Mautner (1995, 1997) proposed that humanity should seed other planetary systems, [[protoplanetary disc]]s or star-forming clouds with [[microorganism]]s, to secure and expand our organic gene/protein lifeform. To avoid interference with local life, the targets may be young planetary systems where local life is unlikely. Directed panspermia can be motivated by [[biotic ethics]] that value the basic patterns of organic gene/protein life with its unique complexity and unity, and its drive for self-propagation.

Directed panspermia is becoming possible due to developments in [[solar sails]], precise [[astrometry]], the discovery of [[extrasolar planets]], [[extremophiles]] and microbial [[genetic engineering]]. [[Cosmological]] projections suggest that life in space can then have a  future.&lt;ref name = "CosmologicalFuture" &gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mautner |first = Michael N. | title = Life in the cosmological future: Resources, biomass and populations  | journal = Journal of the British Interplanetary Society | year = 2005 | volume = 58 | pages = 167–180 | url=http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFCosmologyJBIS2005Paper.pdf |bibcode = 2005JBIS...58..167M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "SeedingBook"&gt;{{Cite book | last =  Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Seeding the Universe with Life: Securing Our Cosmological Future | year = 2000 | location = Washington D. C. | isbn = 047600330X | publisher = Legacy Books (www.amazon.com) |  url = http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFSeedingtheUniverse2005Book.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and motivation ==
An early example of the idea of directed panspermia dates to the early [[science fiction]] work ''[[Last and First Men]]'' by [[Olaf Stapledon]], first published in 1930. It details the manner in which the last humans, upon discovering that the [[Solar System]] will soon be destroyed, send microscopic "seeds of a new humanity" towards potentially [[Planetary habitability|habitable]] areas of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Stapledon| first=Olaf| title=Last and first men|year=2008|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.|isbn=978-0486466828| pages=238|edition=Unabridged republ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 [[Iosif Shklovsky|Shklovskii]] and [[Carl Sagan|Sagan]] speculated that life on Earth may have been seeded through directed panspermia by other civilisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last  = Shklovskii | first  = I. S. | last2 = Sagan | first2 = C. | title = Intelligent life in the universe | year = 1966 | location = New York | publisher = Dell | isbn = 978-1892803023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 Crick and Orgel also discussed the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last  = Crick | first  = F. H. | last2 = Orgel | first2 = L. E. | title = Directed panspermia | journal = Icarus | volume = 19 | issue  = 3 | pages = 341–346 | year = 1973 | doi=10.1016/0019-1035(73)90110-3 | bibcode=1973Icar...19..341C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Mautner and Matloff proposed in 1979, and Mautner examined in detail in 1995 and 1997 the technology and motivation to secure and expand our organic gene/protein life-form by directed panspermia missions to other planetary systems, [[protoplanetary disc]]s and star-forming clouds.&lt;ref name = "SeedingBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last  =  Mautner | first = M. | last2 = Matloff | first2 = G.

A possible objection is potential interference with local life at the targets, but targeting young planetary systems where local life, especially advanced life, could not have started yet, avoids this problem.&lt;ref name = "Mautner3 " /&gt;
 
Directed panspermia may be motivated by the desire to perpetuate the common genetic heritage of all terrestrial life. This motivation was formulated as [[biotic ethics]] that value the common gene/protein patterns of self propagation,&lt;ref name = "Mautner4"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Life-centered ethics and the human future in space | journal = Bioethics | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 433–440 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00688.x | pmid=19077128|url=http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as panbiotic ethics that aim to secure and expand life in the universe.&lt;ref name = "Mautner2" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner3" /&gt;

== Strategies and targets ==
Directed panspermia may be aimed at nearby young planetary systems such as Alpha PsA (25 ly ([[light-year]]s) away) and [[Beta Pictoris]] (63.4 ly), both of which show [[accretion disc]]s and signs of comets and planets. More suitable targets may be identified by space telescopes such as the [[Kepler mission]] that will identify nearby star systems with habitable [[astronomical object]]s. Alternatively, directed panspermia may aim at star-forming interstellar clouds such as [[Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex]] (427 ly), that contains clusters of new stars too young to originate local life (425 infrared-emitting young stars aged 100,000 to a million years). Such clouds contain zones with various densities (diffuse cloud &lt; dark fragment &lt; dense core &lt; protostellar condensation &lt; accretion disc)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mezger  | first = P. G. | title = The search for protostars using millimetre/submillimeter dust emission as a tracer | journal = Planetary Systems: Formation, Evolution and Detection | editors=B. F. Burke, J. H. Rahe and E. E. Roettger | pages = 208–220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that could selectively capture panspermia capsules of various sizes.

Habitable astronomical objects or habitable zones about nearby stars may be targeted by large (10&amp;nbsp;kg)  missions where microbial capsules are bundled and shielded. Upon arrival, microbial capsules in the payload may be dispersed in orbit for capture by planets. Alternatively, small microbial capsules may be sent in large swarms to habitable planets, [[protoplanetary discs]], or zones of various density in interstellar clouds. The microbial swarm provides minimal shielding but does not require high precision targeting, especially when aiming at large interstellar clouds.&lt;ref name = "SeedingBook" /&gt;

== Propulsion and launch ==
Panspermia missions should deliver microorganisms that can grow in the new habitats. They may be sent in 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; kg, 60 μm diameter capsules that allow intact atmospheric entry at the target planets, each containing 100,000 diverse microorganisms suited to various environments. Both for bundled large mass missions and microbial capsule swarms, [[solar sails]] may provide the most simple propulsion for interstellar transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Vulpetti | first1 = G. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = L. | last3 = Matloff | first3 = G. L. | title = Solar Sails : A Novel Approach to Interplanetary Flight | location = New York | publisher = Springer | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-387-34404-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    Spherical sails will avoid orientation control both at launch and at deceleration at the targets.  

For bundled shielded missions to nearby star systems, [[solar sail]]s with thicknesses of 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m and areal densities of 0.0001&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; seem feasible, and sail/payload mass ratios of 10:1 will allow exit velocities near the maximum possible for such sails. Sails with about 540&amp;nbsp;m radius and area of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can impart 10&amp;nbsp;kg payloads with interstellar cruise velocities of 0.0005&amp;nbsp;''c''  (1.5x10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s) when launched from 1&amp;nbsp;au (astronomical unit). At this speed, voyage to the Alpha PsA star will last 50,000&amp;nbsp;y, and to the Rho Opiuchus cloud, 824,000&amp;nbsp;years.

At the targets, the microbial payload would decompose into 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; (100 billion) 30&amp;nbsp;µm capsules to increase the probability of capture. In the swarm strategy to protoplanetary discs and interstellar clouds, 1&amp;nbsp;mm radius, 4.2x10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg microbial capsules are launched from 1&amp;nbsp;au using sails of 4.2x10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg with radius of 0.37&amp;nbsp;m and area of 0.42&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to achieve cruising speeds of 0.0005&amp;nbsp;''[[Speed of light|c]]''. At the target, each capsule decomposes into 4,000 delivery microcapsules of 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg and of 30&amp;nbsp;micrometer radius that allow intact entry to planetary atmospheres.&lt;ref name = "Anders"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Anders | first = E. | title =  Prebiotic organic matter from comets and asteroids | journal = Nature | volume = 342 | pages =  255–257 | year = 1989 |bibcode = 1989Natur.342..255A |doi = 10.1038/342255a0 | issue=6247}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For missions that do not encounter dense gas zones, such as interstellar transit to mature planets or to habitable zones about stars, the microcapsules can be launched directly from 1 au using 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg sails of 1.8&amp;nbsp;mm radius to achieve velocities of 0.0005&amp;nbsp;''c'' to be decelerated by [[radiation pressure]] for capture at the targets. 
The 1&amp;nbsp;mm and 30&amp;nbsp;micrometer radius vehicles and payloads are needed in large numbers for both the bundled and swarm missions. These capsules and the miniature sails for swarm missions can be mass manufactured readily.

==Astrometry and targeting==
The panspermia vehicles would be aimed at moving targets whose locations at the time of arrival must be predicted. This can be calculated using their measured proper motions, their distances, and the cruising speeds of the vehicles. The positional uncertainty and size of the target object then allow estimating the probability that the panspermia vehicles will arrive at their targets.
The positional uncertainty δy (m) of the target at arrival time is given by equation (1), where α&lt;sub&gt;(p)&lt;/sub&gt; is the resolution of proper motion of the target object (arcsec/year), d is the distance from the Earth(m) and v is the velocity of the vehicle (m/s)&lt;ref&gt;Mautner, Michael N. Directed Panspermia. 3. Strategies and Motivations for Seeding Star-Forming Clouds. J. British Interplanetary
Soc. 1997, 50, 93-102&lt;/ref&gt;
:δy = 1.5×10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; α&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/v)
Given the positional uncertainty, the vehicles may be launched with a scatter in a circle about the predicted position of the target. The probability P&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; for a capsule to hit the target area with radius r&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; (m) is the given by the ratio of the targeting scatter and the target area.  
:P&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt;/π(δy)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4.4×10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; r&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(α&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)        							
To apply these equations, the precision of astrometry of star proper motion of 0.00001 arcsec/year, and the solar sail vehicle velocity of 0.0005&amp;nbsp;''c'' (1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s) may be expected within a few decades. For a chosen planetary system, the area A&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; may be the width of the [[habitable zone]], while for interstellar clouds, it may be the sizes of the various density zones of the cloud.

==Deceleration and capture==
Solar sail missions to Sun-like stars can decelerate by [[radiation pressure]] in reverse dynamics of the launch. The sails must be properly oriented at arrival, but orientation control may be avoided using spherical sails. The vehicles must approach the target Sun-like stars at radial distances similar to the launch, about 1 au. After the vehicles are captured in orbit, the microbial capsules may be dispersed in a ring orbiting the star, some within the gravitational capture zone of planets.
Missions to accretion discs of planets and to star-forming clouds will decelerate by viscous drag at the rate dv/dt as determined by equation (3), where v is the velocity, rc the radius of the spherical capsule, ρc is density of the capsule and ρm is the density of the medium.        
: dv/dt =  -(3v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2ρ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) ρ&lt;sub&gt; m&lt;/sub&gt;/r&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; 
A vehicle entering the cloud with a velocity of 0.0005&amp;nbsp;''c'' (1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s) will be captured when decelerated to 2,000&amp;nbsp;m/s, the typical speed of grains in the cloud. 
The size of the capsules can be designed to stop at zones with various densities in the interstellar cloud. Simulations show that a 35 micron radius capsule will be captured in a dense core, and a 1&amp;nbsp;mm radius capsule in a protostellar condensation in the cloud. As for approach to accretion discs about stars, a millimetre size capsule entering the 1000&amp;nbsp;km thick disc face at 0.0005 ''c'' will be captured at 100&amp;nbsp;km into the disc. Therefore, 1&amp;nbsp;mm sized objects may be the best for seeding [[protoplanetary discs]] about new stars and protostellar condensations in interstellar clouds.&lt;ref name = "Mautner3" /&gt;

The captured panspermia capsules will mix with dust. A fraction of the dust and a proportional fraction of the captured capsules will be delivered to astronomical objects. Dispersing the payload into delivery microcapsules will increase the chance that some will be delivered to habitable objects. Particles of 0.6 - 60 micron radius can remain cold enough to preserve organic matter during atmospheric entry to planets or moons.&lt;ref name = "Anders " /&gt; Accordingly, each 1&amp;nbsp;mm, 4.2 ×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; kg capsule captured in the viscous medium can be dispersed into 42,000 delivery microcapsules of 30 micron radius, each weighing 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; kg and containing 100,000 microbes. These objects will not be ejected from the dust cloud by radiation pressure from the star, and will remain mixed with the dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |   last = Morrison | first = D. | title = Sizes and albedos of the larger asteroids | journal = Comets, Asteroids and Meteorites: Interrelations, Evolution and Origins, A.

H. Delsemme, ed., U. of Toledo Press | pages = 159–169 | year = 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
A fraction of the dust, containing the captured microbial capsules, will be captured by planets or moons, or captured in comets and delivered by them later to planets. The probability of capture, P&lt;sub&gt;capture&lt;/sub&gt;, can be estimated from similar processes, such as the capture of interplanetary dust particles by planets and moons in our Solar System, where 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; of the Zodiacal cloud maintained by comet ablation, and also a similar fraction of asteroid fragments, is collected by the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Weatherill | first = G. W. | title = Fragmentation of asteroids and delivery of fragments to Earth | journal = Comets, Asteroids and Meteorites: Interrelations, Evolution and Origins, A. H.

The probability of capture of an initially launched capsule by a planet (or astronomical object) P&lt;sub&gt;planet&lt;/sub&gt; is given by the equation below, where P&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; is the probability that the capsule reaches the target accretion disc or cloud zone, and P&lt;sub&gt;capture&lt;/sub&gt; is the probability of capture from this zone by a planet. 
: P&lt;sub&gt;planet&lt;/sub&gt; = P&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; × P&lt;sub&gt;capture&lt;/sub&gt;
The probability P&lt;sub&gt;planet&lt;/sub&gt; depends on the mixing ratio of the capsules with the dust and on the fraction of the dust delivered to planets. These variables can be estimated for capture in planetary accretion discs or in various zones in the interstellar cloud.

==Biomass requirements==
After determining the composition of chosen [[meteorite]]s, [[Astroecology|astroecologists]] performed laboratory experiments that suggest that many colonizing microorganisms and some plants could obtain most of their chemical nutrients from [[asteroid]] and [[comet]]ary materials.&lt;ref name=bioresources&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Planetary bioresources and astroecology. 1. Planetary microcosm bioessays of Martian and meteorite materials: soluble electrolytes, nutrients, and algal and plant responses|journal = Icarus |volume = 158 | pages = 72–86 |  year = 2002 | doi=10.1006/icar.2002.6841 | bibcode=2002Icar..158...72M | url = http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFBioresourcesIcarus2002Paper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scientists noted that phosphate (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitrate]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–N) critically limit nutrition to many terrestrial lifeforms.&lt;ref name=bioresources/&gt; For successful missions, enough [[biomass]] must be launched and captured for a reasonable chance to initiate life at the target astronomical object. An optimistic requirement is the capture by the planet of 100 capsules with 100,000 microorganisms each, for a total of 10 million organisms with a total biomass of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; kg.

The required biomass to launch for a successful mission is given by following equation. 
m&lt;sub&gt;biomass&lt;/sub&gt; (kg) = 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; / P&lt;sub&gt;planet&lt;/sub&gt;     
Using the above equations for P&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; with transit velocities of 0.0005 c, the known distances to the targets, and the masses of the dust in the target regions then allows calculating the biomass that needs to be launched for probable success. With these parameters, as little as 1&amp;nbsp;gram of biomass (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; microorganisms) could seed Alpha PsA and 4.5&amp;nbsp;gram could seed Beta Pictoris. More biomass needs to be launched to the [[Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex]], mainly because its larger distance. A biomass on the order of 300 tons would need to be launched to seed a protostellar condensation or an accretion disc, but two hundred kilograms would be sufficient to seed a young stellar object in the [[Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex]].

Consequently, as long as the required [[Life#Range of tolerance|physical range of tolerance]] are met (e.g.: growth temperature, cosmic radiation shielding, atmosphere and gravity), lifeforms viable on Earth may be chemically nourished by watery asteroid and planetary materials in this and other planetary systems.&lt;ref name=bioresources/&gt;

==Biological payload==
The seeding organisms need to survive and multiply in the target environments and establish a viable [[biosphere]]. Some of the new branches of life may develop intelligent beings who will further expand life in the galaxy.
The messenger microorganisms may find diverse environments, requiring [[extremophile]] microorganisms with a range of tolerances, including thermophile (high temperature), psychrophile (low temperature), acidophile (high acidity), halophile (high salinity), oligotroph (low nutrient concentration), xerophile (dry environments) and radioresistant (high radiation tolerance) microorganisms. [[Genetic engineering]] may produce polyextremophile microorganisms with several tolerances.    
The target atmospheres will probably lack oxygen, so the colonizers should include [[anaerobic microorganisms]]. Colonizing anaerobic [[cyanobacteria]] may later establish atmospheric oxygen that is needed for higher [[evolution]], as it happened on Earth. Aerobic organisms in the biological payload may be delivered to the astronomical objects later when the conditions are right, by comets that captured and preserved the capsules.

The development of [[eukaryote]] microorganisms was a major bottleneck to higher evolution on Earth. Including eukaryote microorganisms in the payload can bypass this barrier. Multicellular organisms are even more desirable, but being much heavier than bacteria, fewer can be sent. Hardy [[tardigrades]] (water-bears) may be suitable but they are similar to [[arthropods]] and would lead to insects. The body-plan of [[rotifers]] could lead to higher animals, if the rotifers can be hardened to survive interstellar transit.

Microorganisms or capsules captured in the accretion disc can be captured along with the dust into asteroids. During aqueous alteration the asteroids contain water, inorganic salts and organics, and [[astroecology]] experiments with meteorites showed that algae, bacteria, fungi and plant cultures can grow in the asteroids in these media.&lt;ref name = "Bioresources2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Planetary resources and astroecology.

Microorganisms can then spread in the accreting solar nebula, and will be delivered to planets in comets and in asteroids. The microorganisms can grow on nutrients in the carrier comets and asteroids in the aqueous planetary environments, until they adapt to the local environments and nutrients on the planets.&lt;ref name = bioresources/&gt;&lt;ref name = " Bioresources2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Olsson-Francis | first = Karen | last2 = Cockell | first2 = Charles S. | title = Use of cyanobacteria for in-situ resource use in space applications | journal = Planetary and Space Science | volume = 58 | issue = 10 | pages = 1279–1285 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.pss.2010.05.005 | bibcode=2010P&amp;SS...58.1279O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signal in the genome===
A number of publications since 1979 have proposed the idea that directed panspermia could be demonstrated to be the origin of all life on Earth if a distinctive 'signature' message were found, deliberately implanted into either the [[genome]] or the [[genetic code]] of the first microorganisms by our hypothetical progenitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Message through time | author = G.

One outspoken critic is biologist [[PZ Myers]] who said, writing in [[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]]: {{Quote|text=Unfortunately, what they’ve so honestly described is good old honest garbage ... Their methods failed to recognize a well-known functional association in the genetic code; they did not rule out the operation of natural law before rushing to falsely infer design ...

==Concept missions==
Significantly, panspermia missions can be launched by present or near-future technologies. However, more advanced technologies may be also used when these become available.   
The biological aspects of directed panspermia may be improved by [[genetic engineering]] to produce hardy polyextremophile microorganisms and multicellular organisms, suitable to diverse astronomical objects environments. Hardy polyextremophile anaerobic multicellular eukaryots with high radiation resistance, that can form a self-sustaining ecosystem with [[cyanobacteria]], would combine ideally the features needed for survival and higher evolution.

For advanced missions, [[ion thrusters]] or solar sails using [[beam-powered propulsion]] accelerated by Earth-based lasers can achieve speeds up to 0.01 ''c'' (3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s). [[Robots]] may provide in-course navigation, may control the reviving of the frozen microbes periodically during transit to [[DNA repair|repair radiation damage]], and may also choose suitable targets. These propulsion methods and robotics are under development.

Microbial payloads may be also planted on hyperbolic [[comets]] bound for interstellar space. This strategy follows the mechanisms of natural panspermia by comets, as suggested by Hoyle and Wikramasinghe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hoyle | first1 = F. | last2 = Wickramasinghe | first2 = C. | title = Lifecloud: The Origin of Life in the Universe | location = London | publisher = J. M. Dent and Sons | year = 1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The microorganisms would be frozen in the comets at interstellar temperatures of a few [[kelvin]]s and protected from radiation for eons. It is unlikely that an ejected comet will be captured in another planetary system, but the probability can be increased by allowing the microbes to multiply during warm [[perihelion]] approach to the Sun, then fragmenting the comet.  A 1&amp;nbsp;km radius comet would yield 4.2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; one-kg seeded fragments, and rotating the comet would eject these shielded icy objects in random directions into the galaxy. This increases a trillion-fold the probability of capture in another planetary system, compared with transport by a single comet.&lt;ref name = "SeedingBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner2" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner3" /&gt;  Such manipulation of comets is a speculative long-term prospect.

The German physicist [[Claudius Gros]] has proposed that the technology developed by the [[Breakthrough Starshot]] initiative may be utilized in a second step to establish a [[biosphere]] of [[unicellular organism|unicellular microbes]] on otherwise only transiently [[Planetary habitability|habitable]] [[astronomical object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Gros]]: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10509-016-2911-0 ''Developing Ecospheres on Transiently Habitable Planets: The Genesis Project''], Astrophysics and Space Science, Vol. 361, pp 1-14 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of this initiative, the Genesis project, would be to fast forward evolution to a stage equivalent of the [[precambrian]] period on Earth. Gros argues that the Genesis project would be realizable within 50-100 years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/author/jessica-boddy ''Jessica Boddy'']: [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/qa-should-we-seed-life-alien-worlds ''Q&amp;A: Should we seed life on alien worlds?''], [[Science (journal)|Science]], 9. September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; using low-weight probes equipped with a miniaturized gene laboratory for the ''in situ'' [[artificial cell|cell synthesis]] of the microbes.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen Callaway: [http://www.nature.com/news/minimal-cell-raises-stakes-in-race-to-harness-synthetic-life-1.19633 ''Minimal cell raises stakes in race to harness synthetic life'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Genesis project extends directed panspermia to [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] life, arguing that it is more likely that complex life is rare, &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.astrobio.net/alien-life/complex-life-elsewhere-in-the-universe/ ''Complex Life Elsewhere in the Universe?'']&lt;/ref&gt; and not bacterial life.

==Motivation and ethics==
Directed panspermia aims to secure and expand our family of organic gene/protein life. It may be motivated by the desire to perpetuate the common genetic heritage of all terrestrial life. This motivation was formulated as [[biotic ethics]], that value the common gene/protein patterns of  organic life,&lt;ref name = "Mautner4" /&gt; and as panbiotic ethics that aim to secure and expand life in the universe.&lt;ref name = "Mautner2" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Mautner3" /&gt;

[[Molecular biology]] shows complex patterns common to all cellular life, a common [[genetic code]] and a common mechanism to [[Translation (biology)|translate]] it into [[protein]]s, which in turn help to reproduce the DNA code. Also, shared are the basic mechanisms of energy use and material transport. These self-propagating patterns and processes are the core of organic gene/protein life.   
Life is unique because of this complexity, and because of the exact coincidence of the laws of physics that allow life to exist.  Also unique to life is the pursuit of self-propagation, which implies a human purpose to secure and expand life. These objectives are best secured in space, suggesting a panbiotic ethics aimed to secure this future.&lt;ref name = "SeedingBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner2" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner3" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner4" /&gt;

==Objections and counterarguments==
The main objection to directed panspermia is that it may interfere with local life at the targets.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The colonizing microorganisms may out-compete local life for resources, or infect and harm local organisms.  However, this probability can be minimized by targeting newly forming planetary systems, accretion discs and star-forming clouds, where local life, and especially advanced life, could not have emerged yet. If there is local life that is fundamentally different, the colonizing  microorganisms may not harm it. If there is local organic gene/protein life, it may exchange genes with the colonizing microorganisms, increasing galactic [[biodiversity]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
 
Another objection is that space should be left pristine for scientific studies, a reason for planetary quarantine. However, directed panspermia may reach only a few, at most a few hundred new stars, still leaving a hundred billion pristine for local life and for research.     
A technical objection is the uncertain survival of the messenger organisms during long interstellar transit. Research by simulations, and the development on hardy colonizers is needed to address this questions.

A third argument against engaging in directed panspermia derives from the view that wild animals do not —on the average— have lives worth living, and thus spreading life would be morally wrong. Ng supports this view,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ng |first=Y. |date=1995 |title=Towards welfare biology: Evolutionary economics of animal consciousness and suffering |url=http://stafforini.com/library/ng-1995.pdf |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=255–285 |doi=10.1007/bf00852469}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing mainly on the fact that almost all animal species have many more offspring than are needed to replace them. The large number of offspring implies that most of them will die before reaching reproductive age, providing only a short window of life before an often unpleasant death. Tomasik agrees,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last= Tomasik|first= Brian |date= 2015|title=The Importance of Wild-Animal Suffering.  |url=http://www.ledonline.it/index.php/Relations/article/view/880/717 |journal=Relations Beyond Anthropocentrism |volume=3 |issue=3  |doi= 10.7358/rela-2015-002-toma }}&lt;/ref&gt; but places significant weight on the extreme suffering many animals experience, especially at death. Plant responds in detail to Tomasik,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.plantinghappiness.co.uk/the-unproven-and-unprovable-case-for-wild-animal-suffering/ |title=The Unproven (And Unprovable) Case For Wild Animal Suffering |last=Plant |first= Michael}}  &lt;/ref&gt; arguing that because of the vast number of diverse species and the difficulty of rating animal pain and pleasure, we cannot determine if animals have lives worth living. If wild animal lives are overall negative in quality (with more suffering than pleasure), then spreading life through panspermia would be spreading needless pain. From this perspective, directed panspermia is to be strictly avoided, unless and until we can determine that the lives of the animals generated by it would average positive.

==In popular culture==

The discovery of an ancient directed panspermia effort is the central theme of "[[The Chase (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Chase]]," an episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. In the story, [[Captain Picard]] must work to complete the penultimate research of his late archaeology professor's career. That professor, Galen, had discovered that [[DNA]] fragments seeded into the primordial genetic material of 19 worlds could be rearranged to assemble a [[computer algorithm]]. Amid competition (and, later, with begrudging cooperation) from [[Cardassian]], [[Klingon]] and [[Romulan]] expeditions also exploring Galen's research clues, the ''[[U.S.S. Enterprise-D|Enterprise]]'' crew discovers that an alien progenitor race had indeed, [[Abiogenesis|4 billion years]] prior, seeded genetic material across many star systems, thus directing the evolution of many humanoid species.

'''G.I. Joe''' (March 24, 1943 in [[Algiers]] - June 3, 1961 in [[Detroit]]) was a [[pigeon]] noted for his service in the [[United States Army Pigeon Service]]. The bird is part of the homing pigeons used during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] for communication and [[reconnaissance]] purposes. G.I. Joe had the name tag, Pigeon USA43SC6390.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sergeant Gander: A Canadian Hero|last=Walker|first=Robyn|publisher=Dundurn|year=2009|isbn=9781554884636|location=Toronto|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was hatched in March 1943, in [[Algiers]], North Africa and underwent a training for two-way homing pigeons perfected at [[Fort Monmouth]], in [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Army Communications and Electronics at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, 1917-2007|last=U.S. Army|first=|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=2010|isbn=9780160813597|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] of World War II, G.I. Joe saved the lives of the inhabitants of the village of [[Calvi Risorta|Calvi Vecchia]], [[Italy]], and of the [[British Army|British troops]] of [[56th (London) Division|56th (London) Infantry Division]] occupying it. Air support had been previously requested against German positions at Calvi Vecchia on 18 October 1943. However, the [[169th (3rd London) Brigade|169th (London) Infantry Brigade]] attacked and won back the village from the Germans ahead of schedule but they were unable to transmit a message via radio to call off the planned American air raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pigeons: The Fascinating Saga of the World's Most Revered and Reviled Bird|last=Blechman|first=Andrew|publisher=Grove Press|year=2006|isbn=9780802143280|location=New York|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; G.I. Joe was dispatched as a last resort to carry the message and arrived in the air base just in time to avoid the Allied air force from bombing their own men. G.I. Joe flew this 20-mile distance in an impressive 20 minutes, just as the planes were preparing to take off for the target. Up to a thousand men were saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levi |first=Wendell |title= The Pigeon|year= 1977|publisher= Levi Publishing Co, Inc|location= Sumter, S.C.|isbn=0-85390-013-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 1946, G.I. Joe was presented the [[Dickin Medal]] for gallantry by Major-General [[Charles Keightley]] at the Tower of London the citation credits him with ''the most outstanding flight made by a United States Army homing pigeon in World War II''.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;"War Pigeon's Medal." Times [London, England] 5 Nov. 1946: 7. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 6 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The award is also known as the equivalent of the [[Victoria Cross]] or the [[Medal of Honor]] for animals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; G.I. Joe was the 29th and the first non-British recipient of the medal.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

After World War II, he was housed at the U.S. Army's Churchill Loft at Fort Monmouth, in New Jersey along with 24 other heroic pigeons. He died at the [[Detroit Zoo|Detroit Zoological Gardens]] at the age of eighteen, and was mounted and displayed at the [[U.S. Army Communications Electronics Museum]] at [[Fort Monmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monmouth.army.mil/museum/gijoe.shtml G.I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5205">The '''Generalized Hebbian Algorithm''' ('''GHA'''), also known in the literature as '''Sanger's rule''', is a linear [[Feedforward neural network|feedforward]] [[neural network model]] for [[unsupervised learning]] with applications primarily in [[principal components analysis]]. First defined in 1989,&lt;ref name="Sanger89"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sanger |first=Terence D. |authorlink=Terence Sanger |year=1989 |title= Optimal unsupervised learning in a single-layer linear feedforward neural network |journal=Neural Networks |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=459–473 |id= |url=http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse528/09sp/sanger_pca_nn.pdf |accessdate= 2007-11-24 |quote=|doi= 10.1016/0893-6080(89)90044-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is similar to [[Oja's rule]] in its formulation and stability, except it can be applied to networks with multiple outputs.  The name originates because of the similarity between the algorithm and a hypothesis made by [[Donald Hebb]]&lt;ref name="Hebb 1949"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hebb|first=D.O.|authorlink=Donald Olding Hebb|title=The Organization of Behavior|edition=|publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|year=1949|isbn=|series=|ref=harv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyV5AgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the way in which synaptic strengths in the brain are modified in response to experience, i.e., that changes are proportional to the correlation between the firing of pre- and post-synaptic [[neurons]].&lt;ref name="Hertz, Krough, and Palmer, 1991"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hertz|first=John|author2=Anders Krough |author3=Richard G. Palmer |title=Introduction to the Theory of Neural Computation|edition=|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company|location=Redwood City, CA|year=1991|isbn=0201515601|series=|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
GHA combines Oja's rule with the [[Gram-Schmidt process]] to produce a learning rule of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\,\Delta w_{ij} ~ = ~ \eta\left(y_i x_j - y_i \sum_{k=1}^{i} w_{kj} y_k \right)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 | journal = EACL

 | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.102.2084&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} defines the [[synaptic weight]] or connection strength between the {{math|''j''}}th input and {{math|''i''}}th output neurons, {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are the input and output vectors, respectively, and {{math|''η''}} is the ''learning rate'' parameter.

===Derivation===
In matrix form, Oja's rule can be written

:&lt;math&gt;\,\frac{d w(t)}{d t} ~ = ~ w(t) Q - \mathrm{diag} [w(t) Q w(t)^{\mathrm{T}}] w(t)&lt;/math&gt;,

and the Gram-Schmidt algorithm is

:&lt;math&gt;\,\Delta w(t) ~ = ~ -\mathrm{lower} [w(t) w(t)^{\mathrm{T}}] w(t)&lt;/math&gt;,

where {{math|''w''(''t'')}} is any matrix, in this case representing synaptic weights, {{math|''Q'' {{=}} ''η'' '''x''' '''x'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the autocorrelation matrix, simply the outer product of inputs, {{math|diag}} is the function that [[Matrix diagonalization|diagonalizes]] a matrix, and {{math|lower}} is the function that sets all matrix elements on or above the diagonal equal to 0. We can combine these equations to get our original rule in matrix form,

:&lt;math&gt;\,\Delta w(t) ~ = ~ \eta(t) \left(\mathbf{y}(t) \mathbf{x}(t)^{\mathrm{T}} - \mathrm{LT}[\mathbf{y}(t)\mathbf{y}(t)^{\mathrm{T}}] w(t)\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where the function {{math|LT}} sets all matrix elements above the diagonal equal to 0, and note that our output {{math|'''y'''(''t'') {{=}} ''w''(''t'') '''x'''(''t'')}} is a linear neuron.&lt;ref name="Sanger89"/&gt;

===Stability and PCA===

==Applications==
GHA is used in applications where a [[self-organizing map]] is necessary, or where a feature or [[principal components analysis]] can be used. Examples of such cases include [[artificial intelligence]] and speech and image processing.

Its importance comes from the fact that learning is a single-layer process—that is, a synaptic weight changes only depending on the response of the inputs and outputs of that layer, thus avoiding the multi-layer dependence associated with the [[backpropagation]] algorithm. It also has a simple and predictable trade-off between learning speed and accuracy of convergence as set by the learning rate parameter {{math|η}}.&lt;ref name="Haykin98"/&gt;

'''George P. Lakoff''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|eɪ|k|ɒ|f}}; born May 24, 1941) is an American [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguist]] and [[philosopher]], best known for his thesis that [[personal life|lives of individuals]] are significantly influenced by the central [[conceptual metaphor|metaphors]] they use to explain complex phenomena.

The conceptual metaphor thesis, introduced in his and [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Mark Johnson]]'s 1980 book ''[[Metaphors We Live By]]'' has found applications in a number of academic disciplines. Applying  it to politics, literature, philosophy and mathematics has led Lakoff into territory normally considered basic to [[political science]]. In his 1996 book ''[[Moral Politics]]'', Lakoff described [[Conservatism|conservative]] voters as being influenced by the "[[strict father model]]" as a central metaphor for such a complex phenomenon as the [[State (polity)|state]], and [[Liberalism|liberal]]/[[Progressivism|progressive]] voters as being influenced by the "[[nurturant parent model]]" as the [[folk psychology|folk psychological]] metaphor for this complex phenomenon. According to him, an individual's experience and attitude towards sociopolitical issues is influenced by being [[Framing (social sciences)|framed]] in [[Construction grammar|linguistic constructions]]. In ''Metaphor and War: The Metaphor System Used to Justify War in the Gulf'' (1991), he argues that the American involvement in the [[Gulf war]] was obscured or "spun" by the metaphors which were used by the first [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] administration to justify it.&lt;ref&gt;

 |quote= The most natural way to justify a war on moral grounds is to fit this fairy tale structure to a given situation. This is done by metaphorical definition, that is, by answering the questions: Who is the victim? Who is the villain? Who is the hero? What is the crime? What counts as victory? Each set of answers provides a different filled-out scenario. [...] As the gulf crisis developed, President Bush tried to justify going to war by the use of such a scenario. At first, he couldn't get his story straight. What happened was that he was using two different sets of metaphorical definitions, which resulted in two different scenarios [...].

Between 2003 and 2008, Lakoff was involved with a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[think tank]], the now defunct [[Rockridge Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= George Lakoff |publisher= Rockridge Institute |url= http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/people/lakoff |accessdate= 2007-06-13 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070611210922/http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/people/lakoff |archivedate= 2007-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moral Politics"&gt;{{cite book| last = Lakoff| first = George| title = Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think| publisher = The University of Chicago Press| year = 2002 | location = Chicago | isbn = 0-226-46771-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the scientific committee of the [[IDEAS Foundation for progress|Fundación IDEAS]] (IDEAS Foundation), Spain's [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Party]]'s think tank.

The more general theory that elaborated his thesis is known as [[embodied philosophy|embodied mind]]. Lakoff served as a professor of linguistics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], from 1972 until his retirement in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= White|first1= Daphne|title= Berkeley author George Lakoff says, 'Don't underestimate Trump'|url= http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/05/02/berkeley-author-george-lakoff-says-dont-underestimate-trump/|publisher= Berkeleyside.com|date= May 2, 2017}}

==Work==

===Reappraisal of metaphor===
Although some of Lakoff's research involves questions traditionally pursued by linguists, such as the conditions under which a certain linguistic construction is grammatically viable, he is best known for his reappraisal of the role that metaphors play in the socio-political life of humans.

Metaphor has been seen within the Western scientific tradition as a purely linguistic construction. The essential thrust of Lakoff's work has been the argument that metaphors are a primarily conceptual construction and are in fact central to the development of thought.

In his words: 
:"Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature."

According to Lakoff, non-metaphorical thought is possible only when we talk about purely physical reality; the greater the level of abstraction, the more layers of metaphor are required to express it. People do not notice these metaphors for various reasons, including  that some metaphors become 'dead' in the sense that we no longer recognize their origin. Another reason is that we just don't "see" what is "going on".

In intellectual debate, for instance, the underlying metaphor according to Lakoff is usually that argument is war (later revised to "argument is struggle"):
*He ''won'' the argument.
*Your claims are ''indefensible''.
*He ''shot down'' all my arguments.
*His criticisms were ''right on target''.
*If you use that ''strategy'', he'll ''wipe you out''.

According to Lakoff, the development of thought has been the process of developing better metaphors. He also points out that the application of one domain of knowledge to another offers new perceptions and understandings.

===Linguistics wars===
{{further|Linguistics wars}}
Lakoff began his career as a student and later a teacher of the theory of [[transformational grammar]] developed by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] professor [[Noam Chomsky]]. In the late 1960s, however, he joined with others to promote [[generative semantics]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.db-thueringen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-4550/Government_and_Binding.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative to Chomsky's [[generative linguistics|generative syntax]]. In an interview he stated:

{{quote|text=During that period, I was attempting to unify Chomsky's transformational grammar with formal [[logic]]. I had helped work out a lot of the early details of Chomsky's theory of grammar. Noam claimed then — and still does, so far as I can tell — that [[syntax]] is independent of meaning, context, background knowledge, memory, cognitive processing, communicative intent, and every aspect of the body...In working through the details of his early theory, I found quite a few cases where [[semantic]]s, context, and other such factors entered into rules governing the syntactic occurrences of phrases and [[morphemes]]. I came up with the beginnings of an alternative theory in 1963 and, along with wonderful collaborators like [[John R. Ross|"Haj" Ross]] and [[James D. McCawley|Jim McCawley]], developed it through the sixties.&lt;ref&gt;John Brockman (03/09/99), Edge.org,  [http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/lakoff/lakoff_p2.html "Philosophy In The Flesh" A Talk With George Lakoff]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lakoff's claim that Chomsky asserts independence between syntax and semantics has been rejected by Chomsky, who has given examples from within his work where he talks about the relationship between semantics and syntax. Chomsky goes further and claims that Lakoff has "virtually no comprehension of the work he is discussing" (the work in question being Chomsky's).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1973/jul/19/chomsky-replies/ "Chomsky Replies"], ''The New York Review of Books'', 1973 20;12&lt;/ref&gt; His differences with Chomsky contributed to fierce, acrimonious debates among linguists that have come to be known as the "[[linguistics wars]]".

===Embodied mind===
{{further|Embodied philosophy}}
When Lakoff claims the mind is "embodied", he is arguing that almost all of human cognition, up through the most abstract reasoning, depends on and makes use of such concrete and "low-level" facilities as the sensorimotor system and the emotions. Therefore, embodiment is a rejection not only of dualism vis-a-vis mind and matter, but also of claims that human reason can be basically understood without reference to the underlying "implementation details".

Lakoff offers three complementary but distinct sorts of arguments in favor of embodiment. First, using evidence{{Which|date=April 2010}} from [[neuroscience]] and [[neural network]] simulations, he argues that certain concepts, such as color and [[spatial relation]] concepts (e.g. "red" or "over"; see also ''[[qualia]]''), can be almost entirely understood through the examination of how processes of perception or motor control work.

Second, based on [[cognitive linguistics]]' analysis of figurative language, he argues that the reasoning we use for such abstract topics as warfare, economics, or morality is somehow rooted in the reasoning we use for such mundane topics as spatial relationships. (See [[conceptual metaphor]].)

Finally, based on research in [[cognitive psychology]] and some investigations in the [[philosophy of language]], he argues that very few of the categories used by humans are actually of the black-and-white type amenable to analysis in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. On the contrary, most categories are supposed to be much more complicated and messy, just like our bodies.

"We are neural beings", Lakoff states, "Our brains take their input from the rest of our bodies. What our bodies are like and how they function in the world thus structures the very concepts we can use to think. We cannot think just anything — only what our embodied brains permit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/lakoff/lakoff_p1.html |title=EDGE 3rd Culture: A Talk with George Lakoff |publisher=Edge.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakoff believes consciousness to be neurally embodied, however he explicitly states that the mechanism is not just neural computation alone. Using the concept of disembodiment, Lakoff supports the physicalist approach to the afterlife. If the soul can not have any of the properties of the body, then Lakoff claims it can not feel, perceive, think, be conscious, or have a personality. If this is true, then Lakoff asks what would be the point of the afterlife? {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Many scientists share the belief that there are problems with [[falsifiability]] and [[foundation ontology|foundation ontologies]] purporting to describe "what exists", to a sufficient degree of rigor to establish a reasonable method of [[empirical validation]]. But Lakoff takes this further to explain why hypotheses built with complex metaphors cannot be directly falsified. Instead, they can only be rejected based on interpretations of empirical observations guided by other complex metaphors. This is what he means when he says&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G., and M. Johnson, 1999, ''Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and its Challenge to Western Thought'', New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; that falsifiability itself can never be established by any reasonable method that would not rely ultimately on a shared human bias. The bias he's referring to is the set of conceptual metaphors governing how people interpret observations.

Lakoff is, with coauthors [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] and [[Rafael E. Núñez]], one of the primary proponents of the embodied mind thesis. Lakoff discussed these themes in his 2001 [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of Glasgow]], published as ''The Nature and Limits of Human Understanding''.&lt;ref&gt;ed. Anthony Sanford, T &amp; T Clark, 2003. [http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPNLHU&amp;Volume=0&amp;Issue=0&amp;Summary=True Summary] at giffordlectures.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614093320/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPNLHU&amp;Volume=0&amp;Issue=0&amp;Summary=True |date=2011-06-14 }} by Brannon Hancock.&lt;/ref&gt; Others who have written about the embodied mind include philosopher [[Andy Clark]] (See his ''Being There''), philosopher and neurobiologists [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] and his student [[Evan Thompson]] (See Varela, Thompson &amp; Rosch's ''The Embodied Mind''), roboticists such as [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Rolf Pfeifer]] and [[Tom Ziemke]], the physicist [[David Bohm]] (see his ''Thought As A System''), [[Ray Gibbs]] (see his ''Embodiment and Cognitive Science''), [[John Grinder]] and [[Richard Bandler]] in their [[neuro-linguistic programming]], and [[Julian Jaynes]]. The work of these writers can be traced back to earlier philosophical writings, most notably in the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] tradition, such as [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Heidegger]]. The basic thesis of "embodied mind" is also traceable to the American contextualist or pragmatist tradition, notably [[John Dewey]] in such works as ''Art As Experience''.

===Mathematics===
According to Lakoff, even mathematics is subjective to the human species and its cultures: thus "any question of math's being inherent in physical reality is moot, since there is no way to know whether or not it is." By this, he is saying that there is nothing outside of the thought structures we derive from our embodied minds that we can use to "prove" that mathematics is somehow beyond biology. Lakoff and [[Rafael E. Núñez]] (2000) argue at length that [[mathematics|mathematical]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] ideas are best understood in light of the embodied mind. The [[philosophy of mathematics]] ought therefore to look to the current scientific understanding of the human body as a [[foundation ontology]], and abandon self-referential attempts to ground the operational components of mathematics in anything other than "meat".

Mathematical reviewers have generally been critical of Lakoff and Núñez, pointing to mathematical errors {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. Lakoff claims that these errors have been corrected in subsequent printings {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. Although their book attempts a refutation of some of the most widely accepted viewpoints in philosophy of mathematics and advice for how the field might proceed, they have yet to elicit much of a reaction from philosophers of mathematics themselves. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The small community specializing in the psychology of mathematical learning, to which Núñez belongs, is paying attention.&lt;ref&gt;G. Lakoff &amp; R. Núñez. (2000). ''Where Mathematics Comes From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakoff has also claimed that we should remain agnostic about whether math is somehow wrapped up with the very nature of the universe. Early in 2001 Lakoff told the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS): "Mathematics may or may not be out there in the world, but there's no way that we scientifically could possibly tell." This is because the structures of scientific knowledge are not "out there" but rather in our brains, based on the details of our anatomy. Therefore, we cannot "tell" that mathematics is "out there" without relying on conceptual metaphors rooted in our biology. This claim bothers those who believe that there really is a way we could "tell". The falsifiability of this claim is perhaps the central problem in the [[cognitive science of mathematics]], a field that attempts to establish a [[foundation ontology]] based on the human cognitive and scientific process.&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene, S. (1997) ''The number sense: How the mind creates mathematics''. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513240-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political significance and involvement==
Lakoff has publicly expressed both ideas about the conceptual structures that he views as central to understanding the political process, and some of his particular political views. He almost always discusses the latter in terms of the former.

''[[Moral Politics]]'' (1996, revisited in 2002) gives book-length consideration to the conceptual metaphors that Lakoff sees as present in the minds of American "[[American liberalism|liberals]]" and "[[American conservatism|conservatives]]". The book is a blend of cognitive science and political analysis. Lakoff makes an attempt to keep his personal views confined to the last third of the book, where he explicitly argues for the superiority of the liberal vision.&lt;ref name="Moral Politics"/&gt;

Lakoff argues that the differences in opinions between liberals and conservatives follow from the fact that they subscribe with different strength to two different central metaphors about the relationship of the state to its citizens. Both, he claims, see governance through metaphors of the [[family]]. Conservatives would subscribe more strongly and more often to a model that he calls the "[[strict father model]]" and has a family structured around a strong, dominant "father" (government), and assumes that the "children" (citizens) need to be disciplined to be made into responsible "adults" (morality, self-financing). Once the "children" are "adults", though, the "father" should not interfere with their lives: the government should stay out of the business of those in society who have proved their responsibility. In contrast, Lakoff argues that liberals place more support in a model of the family, which he calls the "[[nurturant parent model]]", based on "nurturant values", where both "mothers" and "fathers" work to keep the essentially good "children" away from "corrupting influences" (pollution, social injustice, poverty, etc.). Lakoff says that most people have a blend of both metaphors applied at different times, and that political speech works primarily by invoking these metaphors and urging the subscription of one over the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lakoff| first = George| title = [[Moral Politics (book)|Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think]]| publisher = The University of Chicago Press| year =2002| location = Chicago| pages = 143–176| isbn = 0-226-46771-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakoff further argues that one of the reasons liberals have had difficulty since the 1980s is that they have not been as aware of their own guiding metaphors, and have too often accepted conservative terminology framed in a way to promote the strict father metaphor. Lakoff insists that liberals must cease using terms like ''partial birth abortion'' and ''tax relief'' because they are manufactured specifically to allow the possibilities of only certain types of opinions. ''Tax relief'' for example, implies explicitly that [[taxes]] are an affliction, something someone would want "relief" from. To use the terms of another metaphoric worldview, Lakoff insists, is to unconsciously support it. Liberals must support linguistic [[think tank]]s in the same way that conservatives do if they are going to succeed in appealing to those in the country who share their metaphors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lakoff| first = George| title = Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think| publisher = The University of Chicago Press| year =2002| location = Chicago| pages = 415–418| isbn = 0-226-46771-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2003 and 2008, Lakoff was involved with a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[think tank]], the [[Rockridge Institute]], an involvement that follows in part from his recommendations in ''Moral Politics''. Among his activities with the Institute, which concentrates in part on helping liberal candidates and politicians with re-framing political metaphors, Lakoff has given numerous public lectures and written accounts of his message from ''Moral Politics.'' In 2008, Lakoff joined [[Fenton Communications]], the nation's largest [[public interest]] communications firm, as a Senior Consultant.

One of his political works, ''Don't Think of an Elephant! Know Your Values and Frame the Debate'', self-labeled as "the Essential Guide for Progressives", was published in September 2004 and features a foreword by former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[Howard Dean]].

==Disagreement with Steven Pinker==
In 2006 [[Steven Pinker]] wrote an unfavorable review of Lakoff's book ''Whose Freedom?'' in ''[[The New Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://newrepublic.com/article/77730/block-metaphor-steven-pinker-whose-freedom-george-lakoff "Block that Metaphor!"] ''New Republic'' October 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinker argued that Lakoff's propositions are unsupported, and his prescriptions are a recipe for electoral failure. He wrote that Lakoff was condescending and deplored Lakoff's "shameless caricaturing of beliefs" and his "faith in the power of euphemism". Pinker portrayed Lakoff's arguments as "cognitive relativism, in which mathematics, science, and philosophy are beauty contests between rival frames rather than attempts to characterize the nature of reality." Lakoff wrote a rebuttal to the review&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/lakoff/whencognitivescienceenterspolitics |title="When cognitive science enters politics" |accessdate=2006-10-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517092902/http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/lakoff/whencognitivescienceenterspolitics |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |df= }}, rockridgeinstitute.org, 12 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; stating that his position on many matters is the exact reverse of what Pinker attributes to him. Lakoff states that he explicitly rejects cognitive relativism, arguing that he is "a realist, both about how the mind works and how the world works. Given that the mind works by frames and metaphors, the challenge is to use such a mind to accurately characterize how the world works."&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

===Glaxo Wellcome===
[[File:Glaxo Factory, Bunnythorpe, New Zealand 03.JPG|thumb|The historic Glaxo factory in [[Bunnythorpe|Bunnythorpe, New Zealand]], with the Glaxo Laboratories sign still visible]]

Joseph Nathan and Co. was founded in 1873 as a general trading company in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, by a Londoner, [[Joseph Nathan (businessman)|Joseph Edward Nathan]].&lt;ref&gt;R. P. T. Davenport-Hines, Judy Slinn, ''Glaxo: A History to 1962'', Cambridge University Press, 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;7–13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 it began producing a dried-milk baby food from excess milk produced on the family farms outside [[Bunnythorpe]]. The resulting product was first known as Defiance, then as Glaxo (from ''lacto''), under the slogan "Glaxo builds bonny babies."&lt;ref&gt;David Newton, ''Trademarked: A History of Well-Known Brands, from Airtex to Wright's Coal Tar'', The History Press, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;435.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ravenscraft2000&gt;David J.

The company's first pharmaceutical product, released in 1924, was vitamin D.&lt;ref name=Ravenscraft2000/&gt;{{rp|306}}

Glaxo Laboratories was registered as a subsidiary company in London in 1935. Glaxo bought out its parent, Joseph Nathan in 1947 and acquired [[Allen &amp; Hanburys]] in 1958. The Scottish pharmacologist [[David Jack (scientist)|David Jack]] was hired as a researcher for Allen &amp; Hanburys a few years after Glaxo took it over; he went on to lead the company's R&amp;D until 1987.&lt;ref name=Ravenscraft2000/&gt;{{rp|306}} After the company bought Meyer Laboratories in 1978, it began to play an important role in the US market. In 1983 the American arm, Glaxo Inc., moved to [[Research Triangle Park]] (US headquarters/research) and Zebulon (US manufacturing) in North Carolina.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Burroughs Wellcome &amp; Company was founded in 1880 in London by the American pharmacists [[Henry Wellcome]] and [[Silas Mainville Burroughs (pharmacist)|Silas Burroughs]].

[[File:BeechamsBuilding.jpg|thumb|Beecham's Clock Tower, constructed 1877, part of the [[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]]'s factory, [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]]]]

In 1848 [[Thomas Beecham (chemist)|Thomas Beecham]] launched his [[Beecham's Pills]] laxative in England, giving birth to the [[Beecham Group]]. In 1859 Beecham opened its first factory in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], [[Lancashire]]. By the 1960s Beecham was extensively involved in pharmaceuticals and consumer products such as Macleans toothpaste, Lucozade and synthetic penicillin research.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corely|first1=T.A.B.|title=Beechams, 1848-2000: from Pills to Pharmaceuticals|date=2011|publisher=Crucible Books|isbn=1905472145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John K. Smith]] opened his first pharmacy in Philadelphia in 1830. In 1865 [[Mahlon Kline]] joined the business, which 10 years later became Smith, Kline &amp; Co. In 1891 it merged with French, Richard and Company, and in 1929 changed its name to [[SmithKline &amp; French|Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories]] as it focused more on research. Years later it bought Norden Laboratories, a business doing research into animal health, and [[Recherche et Industrie Thérapeutiques]] in Belgium in 1963 to focus on vaccines. The company began to expand globally, buying seven laboratories in Canada and the United States in 1969. In 1982 it bought [[Allergan]], a manufacturer of eye and skincare products.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

SmithKline &amp; French merged with Beckman Inc. in 1982 and changed its name to ''SmithKline Beckman''. In 1988 it bought its biggest competitor, International Clinical Laboratories, and in 1989 merged with [[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]] to form ''SmithKline Beecham plc''. The headquarters moved from the United States to England. To expand R&amp;D in the United States, the company bought a new research center in 1995; another opened in 1997 in England at New Frontiers Science Park, [[Harlow]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Controversies==
===2012 criminal and civil settlement===
====Overview====
In July 2012 GSK pleaded guilty in the United States to criminal charges, and agreed to pay $3 billion, in what was the [[List of Largest Pharmaceutical Settlements|largest settlement]] until then between the Justice Department and a drug company. The $3 billion included a criminal fine of $956,814,400 and forfeiture of $43,185,600. The remaining $2 billion covered a civil settlement with the government under the [[False Claims Act]]. The investigation was launched largely on the basis of information from four whistleblowers who filed [[qui tam]] (whistleblower) lawsuits against the company under the False Claims Act.&lt;ref name=USDOJJuly2012&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/July/12-civ-842.html "GlaxoSmithKline to Plead Guilty and Pay $3 Billion to Resolve Fraud Allegations and Failure to Report Safety Data"], United States Department of Justice, 2 July 2012.{{pb}}

The charges stemmed from GSK's promotion of the anti-depressants Paxil ([[paroxetine]]) and Wellbutrin ([[bupropion]]) for unapproved uses from 1998–2003, specifically as suitable for patients under the age of 18, and from its failure to report safety data about Avandia ([[rosiglitazone]]), both in violation of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]. Other drugs promoted for unapproved uses were two inhalers, Advair ([[fluticasone/salmeterol]]) and Flovent ([[fluticasone propionate]]), as well as Zofran ([[ondansetron]]), Imitrex ([[sumatriptan]]), Lotronex ([[alosetron]]) and Valtrex ([[valaciclovir]]).&lt;ref name=USDOJJuly2012/&gt;

The settlement also covered reporting false best prices and underpaying rebates owed under the [[Medicaid Drug Rebate Program]], and kickbacks to physicians to prescribe GSK's drugs. There were all-expenses-paid spa treatments and hunting trips for doctors and their spouses, speakers' fees at conferences, and payment for articles [[Medical ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by the company and placed by physicians in medical journals.&lt;ref name=USDOJJuly2012/&gt; The company set up a ghostwriting programme called CASPPER, initially to produce articles about Paxil but which was extended to cover Avandia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Baucus]], [[Chuck Grassley]], [http://finance.senate.gov/newsroom/chairman/download/?id=a5c07780-6351-4905-8c63-52e4a7a7a66b "Finance Committee Letter to the FDA Regarding Avandia"], United States Senate Finance Committee, 12 July 2010.&lt;p&gt;
Jim Edwards, [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/inside-gsks-cassper-ghostwriting-program/ "Inside GSK's CASSPER Ghostwriting Program"], CBS News, 21 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the settlement GSK signed a five-year [[corporate integrity agreement]] with the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], which obliged the company to make major changes in the way it did business, including changing its compensation programmes for its sales force and executives, and to implement and maintain transparency in its research practices and publication policies.&lt;ref name=USDOJJuly2012/&gt; It announced in 2013 that it would no longer pay doctors to promote its drugs or attend medical conferences, and that its sales staff would no longer have prescription targets.&lt;ref name=Reuters17Dec2013&gt;[http://sustainability.thomsonreuters.com/2013/12/17/gsk-stop-paying-doctors-major-marketing-overhaul "GSK to stop paying doctors in major marketing overhaul"], Thomson/Reuters, 17 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rosiglitazone (Avandia)====
{{further|Rosiglitazone#Adverse effects|Rosiglitazone#Lawsuits}}
[[File:Avandia 2mg oral tablet.jpg|thumb|[[Rosiglitazone]]]]
The 2012 settlement included a criminal fine of $242,612,800 for failing to report safety data to the FDA about Avandia ([[rosiglitazone]]), a [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]] drug approved in 1999, and a civil settlement of $657 million for making false claims about it. The Justice Department said GSK had promoted rosiglitazone to physicians with misleading information, including that it conferred cardiovascular benefits despite an FDA-mandated label warning of cardiovascular risks.&lt;ref name=USDOJJuly2012/&gt;

In 1999 [[John Buse]], a diabetes specialist, told medical conferences that rosiglitazone might carry an increased risk of cardiovascular problems. GSK threatened to sue him, called his university head of department, and persuaded him to sign a retraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finance.senate.gov/download/?id=883E903D-F973-4A74-8432-3C651C71B4B4 "The Intimidation of Dr. John Buse and the Diabetes Drug Avandia"], Committee on Finance, United States Senate, November 2007, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; GSK raised questions internally about the drug's safety in 2000, and in 2002 the company [[Medical ghostwriter|ghostwrote]] an article in [[Circulation (journal)|''Circulation'']] describing a GSK funded clinical trial that suggested rosiglitazone might have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Baucus]], [[Chuck Grassley]], [http://finance.senate.gov/newsroom/chairman/download/?id=a5c07780-6351-4905-8c63-52e4a7a7a66b "Finance Committee Letter to the FDA Regarding Avandia"], United States Senate Finance Committee, 12 July 2010; for internal concerns, p. 2 and attachment E, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–35; for ghostwriting, p. 3 and attachment H, pp. 58–109; for the ghostwriting, attachment I, p. 110ff; for cover letter to ''Circulation'', attachment I, p.&amp;nbsp;143; for the ghostwritten article, attachment I, pp.&amp;nbsp;152–158.{{pb}}

====Bupropion (Wellbutrin)====
The company was also fined for promoting Wellbutrin ([[bupropion]])&amp;nbsp;– approved at the time for [[major depressive disorder]] and also sold as a smoking-cessation aid, Zyban&amp;nbsp;– for weight loss and the treatment of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], sexual dysfunction and substance addiction.

===Antitrust case over griseofulvin===
In the 1960s Glaxo Group Ltd.

There were concerns in the 2000s about the sugar and vitamin content of [[Ribena]], a [[blackcurrant]]-based [[syrup]] and [[soft drink]] owned by GSK until 2013. Produced in England by H.W. Carter &amp; Co from the 1930s, the company's unbranded syrup was distributed to children as a source of [[vitamin C]] during World War II, which gave the drink a reputation as good for health. [[Beecham Group|Beecham]] bought H. W. Carter in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Thring, [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/sep/07/consider-squash-cordial "Consider squash and cordial"], ''The Guardian'', 7 September 2010.{{pb}}

In 2001 the British [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) required GSK to withdraw its claim that Ribena Toothkind, a lower-sugar variety, did not encourage tooth decay. A company poster showed bottles of Toothkind in place of the bristles on a toothbrush. The ASA's ruling was upheld by the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;Linus Gregoriadis, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1318417/Makers-of-Ribena-lose-fight-over-anti-decay-claims.html "Makers of Ribena lose fight over anti-decay claims"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 18 January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 GSK was fined $217,000 in New Zealand over its claim that ready-to-drink Ribena contained high levels of vitamin C, after it was found to contain no detectable vitamin C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10431253|title=Judge orders Ribena to fess up|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|author=David Eames|date=28 March 2007}}{{pb}}

===SB Pharmco Puerto Rico===
In 2010 the US Department of Justice announced that GSK would pay a $150 million criminal fine and forfeiture, and a civil settlement of $600 million under the False Claims Act. The fines stemmed from production of improperly made and adulterated drugs from 2001 to 2005 at GSK's subsidiary, SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc., in Cidra, Puerto Rico, which at the time produced $5.5 billion of products each year. The drugs involved were [[Kytril]], an antiemetic; [[Bactroban]], used to treat skin infections; Paxil, the anti-depressant; and [[Avandamet]], a diabetes drug.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/October/10-civ-1205.html "GlaxoSmithKline to Plead Guilty &amp; Pay $750 Million to Resolve Criminal and Civil Liability Regarding Manufacturing Deficiencies at Puerto Rico Plant"], U.S. Department of Justice, 26 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; GSK closed the factory in 2009.&lt;ref name=NYTPuerto&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/business/27drug.html | title = Glaxo to Pay $750 Million for Sale of Bad Products | work = The New York Times | date = 27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''New York Times'', the case began in 2002 when GSK sent experts to fix problems cited by the FDA. The lead inspector recommended recalls of defective products, but they were not authorised; she was fired in 2003 and filed a whistleblower lawsuit. In 2005 federal marshals seized $2 billion worth of products, the largest such seizure in history. In the 2010 settlement SB Pharmco plead guilty to criminal charges, and agreed to pay $150&amp;nbsp;million in a criminal fine and forfeiture, at that time the largest such payment ever by a manufacturer of adulterated drugs, and $600&amp;nbsp;million in civil penalties to settle the civil lawsuit.&lt;ref  name=NYTPuerto/&gt;

===Market manipulation in the UK===
In February 2016 the company was fined over £37 million in the UK by the [[Competition and Markets Authority]] for paying [[Generics UK]], [[Alpharma]] and [[Norton Healthcare]] more than £50m between 2001 and 2004 to keep generic varieties of [[paroxetine]] out of the UK market. The generics companies were fined a further £8 million. At the end of 2003, when generics became available in the UK, the price of paroxetine dropped by 70 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Watchdog fines GSK £37m for paying to keep generic drugs out of UK market|author=Julia Bradshaw|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/pharmaceuticalsandchemicals/12153450/Watchdog-fines-GSK-37m-for-paying-to-keep-generic-drugs-out-of-UK-market.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian police sought bribery charges in May 2004 against 4,400 doctors and 273 GSK employees. GSK and its predecessor were accused of having spent £152m on physicians, pharmacists and others, giving them cameras, computers, holidays and cash. Doctors were alleged to have received cash based on the number of patients they treated with a cancer drug, [[topotecan]] (Hycamtin).&lt;ref&gt;John Hooper, Heather Stewart, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/may/27/italy.heatherstewart "Over 4,000 doctors face charges in Italian drugs scandal"], ''The Guardian'', 27 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The following month prosecutors in Munich accused 70–100 doctors of having accepted bribes from SmithKline Beecham between 1997 and 1999.

In 2006 in the United States GSK settled the largest tax dispute in IRS history, agreeing to pay $3.1&amp;nbsp;billion. At issue were Zantac and other products sold in 1989–2005. The case revolved around intracompany [[transfer pricing]]—determining the share of profit attributable to the US subsidiaries of GSK and subject to tax by the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/12/business/worldbusiness/12glaxo.html "GlaxoSmithKline to Settle Tax Dispute With U.S."], Reuters, 12 September 2006; [https://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Accepts-Settlement-Offer-in-Largest-Transfer-Pricing-Dispute "IRS Accepts Settlement Offer in Largest Transfer Pricing Dispute"], IRS, 11 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5236">[[File:Winchester Trusty Servant 2.jpg|thumb|19th century engraving of ''The Trusty Servant'', from the 1579 painting by [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]]]]
[[File:Sign for the Trusty Servant - geograph.org.uk - 1036009 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Inn sign]] copied from ''The Trusty Servant'', at ''The Trusty Servant Inn'', [[Minstead]], Hampshire]]

The '''hircocervus''' ({{lang-la|hircus}}, "billy goat" + ''cervus'', "stag") or '''tragelaph''' ({{lang-el|τράγος||translit=tragos}}, "billy goat" + έλαφος, ''elaphos'', "stag"), also known as a '''goat-stag''' or '''horse-stag''', was a legendary creature imagined to be half-[[goat]], half-[[stag]].

==Origins==

In his work ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', [[Aristotle]] utilized the idea of a fabulous goat-stag to express the philosophical concept of something that is knowable even though it does not really exist.&lt;ref name="quinion"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-hir1.htm|author=Quinion, Michael|title= Hircocervus|year=2009|publisher=World Wide Words|accessdate=February 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Plato's Republic|Plato's ''Republic'']], [[Socrates]] speaks of his own image-making as similar to that of painters who paint goat-stags, combining the features of different things together (488a).&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]] [[Plato's Republic|''Republic'']]. 488a.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''hircocervus'' first appears in the [[English language]] in a [[medieval]] manuscript dating from 1398 (now at the [[Bodleian Library]]).&lt;ref name="quinion"/&gt;

==''The Trusty Servant''==

A hircocervus is depicted in a wall-painting called ''The Trusty Servant'', painted by [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] in 1579.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spode.co.uk/history/trustyservant.htm Pattern Histories: The Trusty Servant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204073530/http://www.spode.co.uk/History/trustyservant.htm |date=2008-12-04 }} accessed 29 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  It hangs outside the kitchen of [[Winchester College]] in [[Hampshire]], England.&lt;ref name="quinion"/&gt;  The author [[Arthur Cleveland Coxe]] described "the time-honoured ''Hircocervus'', or picture of 'the Trusty-servant,' which hangs near the kitchen, and which emblematically sets forth those virtues in domestics, of which we Americans know nothing. It is a figure, part man, part porker, part deer, and part donkey; with a padlock on his mouth, and various other symbols in his hands and about his person, the whole signifying a most valuable character."&lt;ref name="coxe"&gt;Arthur Cleveland Coxe, ''Impressions of England''. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=QA0HAAAAQAAJ&amp;jtp=249#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting of ''The Trusty Servant'' had a [[didactic]] function: it is accompanied by [[allegorical]] verses that associate the hircocervus servant's various animal parts with distinctive virtues that the students of Winchester College were meant to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Thornton Burnett, ''Constructing "monsters" in Shakespearean drama and early modern culture'' (New York: Macmillan, 2002), 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Latin]] verses have been translated into English as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
A trusty servant's picture would you see,
This figure well survey, who'ever you be.
The porker's snout not nice in diet shows; 
The padlock shut, no secret he'll disclose; 
Patient, to angry lords the ass gives ear;
Swiftness on errand, the stag's feet declare;
Laden his left hand, apt to labour saith;
The coat his neatness; the open hand his faith;
Girt with his sword, his shield upon his arm,
Himself and master he'll protect from harm.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Howard Staunton, ''The Great Schools of England'' (Strahan. 1869), 61n.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In culture==

[[Umberto Eco]] refers to a hircocervus in his novel ''[[The Island of the Day Before]]''.&lt;ref name="quinion"/&gt;

Martin Luther uses the term "Goat-stag" (''tragelaphus'' in his Latin) in his ''Theses Against the Antinomians'' (1540, Sixth Set) to describe "a law that does not condemn". Luther is stating that one can imagine a law from God that only instructs or teaches without threatening and condemning human sin. However, Luther claims that such a law, often sought by theologians throughout Christian history, does not actually exist.&lt;ref&gt;Luther, Martin. ''Weimar Ausgabe''. 39I:358.26-27; Luther, Martin. ''Solus Decalogus Est Aeternus: Martin Luther’s Complete Antinomian Theses and Disputations''. Ed. and trans. Holger Sonntag. Latin and English ed. (Minneapolis: Lutheran Press, 2008): 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Trusty Servant Medal==
In 2014 Winchester College commissioned a [[medal]] by [[Old Wykehamist]] [[Anthony Smith (sculptor)|Anthony Smith]] to be awarded to staff in recognition of "Long And Loyal Service". The medal features a [[relief sculpture]] of the ''hircocervus'', as it appears in ''The Trusty Servant'' painting.&lt;ref name="Trusty Servant Medal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trusty Servant Medal|url=http://anthonysmithart.co.uk/?portfolio=trusty-servant-medal|website=Anthony Smith Sculpture|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''infomorph''' is a virtual body of information that may possess emergent features such as personality. The term was coined in [[Charles Platt (author)|Charles Platt]]'s 1991 novel ''The Silicon Man'', where it refers to a single biological consciousness transferred into a computer through a process of [[mind transfer]]. In the book, a character refers to an infomorph as "intelligence held in a computer memory", and an "information entity".&lt;ref name=SiliconMan&gt;{{Cite book |last=Platt |first=Charles |title=The Silicon Man |year=1997 |ISBN=1-888869-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the vision shared in Platt’s novel will ever be more than a theory is uncertain, but computing power is still [[exponential growth|increasing exponentially]] (see [[Moore's law]] for more details), and the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] at [[Oxford University]] have considered the philosophical and technical feasibility of this theory at some point in the future.&lt;ref name=Roadmap&gt;{{Cite book |last=Anders |first=Sandberg |last2=Nick |first2=Boström |title=Whole  Brain  Emulation: A  Roadmap
|quote=The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain. |url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-3.pdf |accessdate=5 April 2009 |series= Technical Report #2008‐3 |year=2008 | publisher = Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute considers it theoretically possible to understand the absolute workings of every aspect of the mind, and the ability to measure this in a specific individual, although Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]] may apply if it is discovered that the brain's workings on a quantum scale are relevant to the workings of the mind. However, the rate of appreciation of knowledge in neuroscience and psychology is far slower than the rate of increase in computing power. There are also philosophical questions to be answered, the most important being the nature of consciousness and whether it is possible to transfer a consciousness or if this transfer would effectively be a copy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Amber Case, a pioneer of [[cyborg anthropology]], considers users of [[social network]]s to be "partial infomorphs", along with people whose writing is left behind after their death. She talks of an "informorphic footprint", corresponding to the size of information created and distributed during a person's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Case |first=Amber |title=A Dictionary of Cyborg Anthropology| url=http://cyborganthropology.com/Infomorph|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In each [[brain hemisphere|hemisphere]] of the [[mammal]]ian [[brain]] the '''insular cortex''' (also '''insula''' and '''insular lobe''') is a portion of the [[cerebral cortex]] folded deep within the [[lateral sulcus]] (the fissure separating the [[temporal lobe]] from the [[parietal lobe|parietal]] and [[frontal lobe]]s).

The insulae are believed to be involved in [[consciousness]] and play a role in diverse functions usually linked to [[emotion]] or the regulation of the body's [[homeostasis]]. These functions include compassion and empathy,  [[perception]], [[motor control]], [[self-awareness]], [[cognitive function]]ing, and [[interpersonal relationship|interpersonal experience]]. In relation to these, it is involved in [[psychopathology]].

The insular cortex is divided into two parts: the larger anterior insula and the smaller posterior insula in which more than a dozen field areas have been identified. The cortical area overlying the insula toward the lateral surface of the brain is the [[Operculum (brain)|operculum]] (meaning ''lid''). The opercula are formed from parts of the enclosing frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes.

==Structure==

===Connections===
The anterior part of the insula is subdivided by shallow sulci into three or four '''short gyri'''.

The anterior insula receives a direct projection from the basal part of the [[Ventral nuclear group|ventral medial nucleus]] of the thalamus and a particularly large input from the [[central nucleus of the amygdala]]. In addition, the anterior insula itself projects to the [[amygdala]].

One study on rhesus monkeys revealed widespread reciprocal connections between the insular cortex and almost all subnuclei of the amygdaloid complex. The posterior insula projects predominantly to the dorsal aspect of the lateral and to the central amygdaloid nuclei. In contrast, the anterior insula projects to the anterior amygdaloid area as well as the medial, the cortical, the accessory basal magnocellular, the medial basal, and the lateral amygdaloid nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MUFSON|first=E|author2=MESULAM, M |author3=PANDYA, D |title=Insular interconnections with the amygdala in the rhesus monkey|journal=Neuroscience|date=1 July 1981|volume=6|issue=7|pages=1231–1248|doi=10.1016/0306-4522(81)90184-6|pmid=6167896|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0306452281901846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The posterior part of the insula is formed by a '''long gyrus'''.

The posterior insula connects reciprocally with the [[secondary somatosensory cortex]] and receives input from [[spinothalamic tract|spinothalamically]] activated [[Ventral nuclear group|ventral posterior inferior]] thalamic nuclei. It has also been shown that this region receives inputs from the ventromedial nucleus (posterior part) of the thalamus that are highly specialized to convey homeostatic information such as pain, temperature, itch, local oxygen status, and sensual touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Craig AD, Chen K, Bandy D, Reiman EM | year = 2000 | title = Thermosensory activation of insular cortex | url = | journal = Nat. Neurosci. | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 184–90 | doi = 10.1038/72131 | pmid = 10649575 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A human neuroimaging study using [[diffusion MRI|diffusion tensor imaging]] revealed that the anterior insula is interconnected to regions in the temporal and occipital lobe, opercular and orbitofrontal cortex, triangular and opercular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus. The same study revealed differences in the anatomical connection patterns between the left and right hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=JAKAB|first=A|author2=MOLNAR, P |author3=BOGNER, P |author4=BERES, M |author5=BERENYI, E |title= Connectivity-based parcellation reveals interhemispheric differences in the insula|journal=Brain Topography|date=1 Oct 2011| doi= 10.1007/s10548-011-0205-y|pmid=22002490|url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/g713122624418405/ |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=264–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

behind.&lt;ref name="Sobotta's Atlas and Text-book of human anatomy 1909" /&gt;

===Cytoarchitecture===
The insular cortex has regions of variable cell structure or [[cytoarchitecture]], changing from [[granule cell|granular]] in the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] portion to agranular in the [[anterior]] portion. The insula also receives differential [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] and [[thalamus|thalamic]] input along its length.  [[John Allman]] and his colleagues have shown that the anterior insular cortex contains a population of neurons, called [[spindle neurons]]. These are also called ''von Economo neurons'', identified as characterising a distinctive  subregion as the agranular frontal insula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauernfeind A|title =A volumetric comparison of the insular cortex and its subregions in primates|journal=Human Evolution|date=April 2013|volume=64 | issue = 4 |pages=263–279|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.12.003|pmc=3756831|display-authors=etal|pmid=23466178}}&lt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
The insular cortex is considered a separate [[lobes of the brain|lobe]] of the [[telencephalon]] by some authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555359/Brain.html Brain], MSN Encarta. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kwrNZouh?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555359/Brain.html Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources see the insula as a part of the [[temporal lobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kolb, Bryan |author2=Whishaw, Ian Q. |title=Fundamentals of human neuropsychology |publisher=Worth |location=[New York] |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-7167-5300-6 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes grouped with limbic structures deep in the brain into a [[limbic lobe]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} As a paralimbic cortex, the insular cortex is considered to be a relatively old structure.

==Function==
===Multimodal sensory processing, sensory binding===
Functional imaging studies show activation of the insula during audio-visual integration tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bushara|first1=KO|last2=Grafman|first2=J|last3=Hallett|first3=M|title=Neural correlates of auditory-visual stimulus onset asynchrony detection.|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=1 January 2001|volume=21|issue=1|pages=300–4|pmid=11150347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bushara|first1=KO|last2=Hanakawa|first2=T|last3=Immisch|first3=I|last4=Toma|first4=K|last5=Kansaku|first5=K|last6=Hallett|first6=M|title=Neural correlates of cross-modal binding.|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=February 2003|volume=6|issue=2|pages=190–5|pmid=12496761|doi=10.1038/nn993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interoceptive awareness===
{{Further |Interoception}}
There is evidence that, in addition to its base functions, the insula may play a role in certain higher-level functions that operate only in humans and other [[Hominidae|great apes]]. The spindle neurons found at a higher density in the right frontal insular cortex are also found in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], which is another region that has reached a high level of specialization in great apes. It has been speculated that these neurons are involved in [[Cognition|cognitive]]-[[emotion]]al processes that are specific to primates including great apes, such as [[empathy]] and [[metacognition|metacognitive]] emotional feelings. This is supported by functional imaging results showing that the structure and function of the right frontal insula is correlated with the ability to feel one's own heartbeat, or to empathize with the pain of others. It is thought that these functions are not distinct from the lower-level functions of the insula but rather arise as a consequence of the role of the insula in conveying homeostatic information to [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Benedetto De Martino |author2=Dharshan Kumaran |author3=Ben Seymour |author4=Raymond J.

The insula is active during social decision making. Tiziana Quarto et al. measured [[emotional intelligence]] (EI) (the ability to identify, regulate, and process emotions of themselves and of others) of sixty-three healthy subjects. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] EI was measured in correlation with left insular activity. The subjects were shown various pictures of [[facial expression]]s and tasked with deciding to approach or avoid the person in the picture. The results of the social decision task yielded that individuals with high EI scores had left insular activation when processing fearful faces. Individuals with low EI scores had left insular activation when processing angry faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quarto|first=Tiziana|last2=Blasi|first2=Giuseppe|last3=Maddalena|first3=Chiara|last4=Viscanti|first4=Giovanna|last5=Lanciano|first5=Tiziana|last6=Soleti|first6=Emanuela|last7=Mangiulli|first7=Ivan|last8=Taurisano|first8=Paolo|last9=Fazio|first9=Leonardo|date=2016-02-09|title=Association between Ability Emotional Intelligence and Left Insula during Social Judgment of Facial Emotions|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0148621|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=11|issue=2|pages=e0148621|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0148621|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4747486|pmid=26859495|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1148621Q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotions ===
The insular cortex, in particular its most anterior portion, is considered a [[limbic]]-related cortex. The insula has increasingly become the focus of attention for its role in body representation and subjective emotional experience. In particular, [[Antonio Damasio]] has proposed that this region plays a role in mapping visceral states that are associated with emotional experience, giving rise to conscious feelings. This is in essence a neurobiological formulation of the ideas of [[William James]], who first proposed that subjective emotional experience (i.e., feelings) arise from our brain's interpretation of bodily states that are elicited by emotional events. This is an example of [[embodied cognition]].

In terms of function, the insula is believed to process convergent information to produce an ''emotionally relevant context for sensory experience''. To be specific, the anterior insula is related more to ''olfactory, gustatory, viscero-autonomic, and limbic function'', whereas the posterior insula is related more to ''auditory-somesthetic-skeletomotor'' function. [[fMRI|Functional imaging experiments]] have revealed that the insula has an important role in [[pain]] experience and the experience of a number of basic [[emotions]], including [[anger]], [[fear]], [[disgust]], [[happiness]], and [[sadness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wager|first=Tor|title=Functional Neuroanatomy of Emotion: A Meta-Analysis of Emotion Activation Studies in PET and fMRI|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811902910876|doi=10.1006/nimg.2002.1087|pmid=12030820|volume=16|issue=2|date=June 2002|journal=NeuroImage|pages=331–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anterior insular cortex (AIC) is believed to be responsible for emotional feelings, including maternal and romantic love, anger, fear, sadness, happiness, sexual arousal, disgust, aversion, unfairness, inequity, indignation, uncertainty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vilares I, Howard JD, Fernandes HL, Gottfried JA, Kording KP |title=Differential Representations of Prior and Likelihood Uncertainty in the Human Brain |journal=Current Biology |volume=22 |issue=18 |pages=1641–1648 |date=2012 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2012.07.010 |pmid=22840519 |pmc=3461114 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982212008019}}&lt;/ref&gt; disbelief, social exclusion, trust, empathy, sculptural beauty, a ‘state of union with God’, and hallucinogenic states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Craig |first=A. D. (Bud) |year=2009 |title=How do you feel — now? The anterior insula and human awareness|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience  |volume= 10|pages=59–70 |url=http://www.allmanlab.caltech.edu/biCNS217/PDFs/Craig2009.pdf |doi=10.1038/nrn2555 |issue=1 |pmid=19096369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional imaging studies have also implicated the insula in conscious desires, such as food craving and drug craving. What is common to all of these emotional states is that they each change the body in some way and are associated with highly salient subjective qualities. The insula is well-situated for the integration of information relating to bodily states into higher-order cognitive and emotional processes. The insula receives information from "homeostatic afferent" sensory pathways via the thalamus and sends output to a number of other limbic-related structures, such as the [[amygdala]], the [[ventral striatum]], and the [[orbitofrontal cortex]], as well as to [[Motor cortex|motor cortices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Craig |first=A. D. (Bud) |year=2002 |title=A new view of pain as a homeostatic emotion |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=303–307 |url=http://meagherlab.tamu.edu/M-Meagher/%20Health%20Psyc%20630/Readings%20630/Pain%20mech%20read/Craig%2003%20pain%20emotion.pdf |doi=10.1016/s0166-2236(03)00123-1 |pmid=12798599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study using [[magnetic resonance imaging]] found that the right anterior insula is significantly thicker in people that [[meditate]].&lt;ref name="pmid16272874"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lazar SW, Kerr CE, Wasserman RH, Gray JR, Greve DN, Treadway MT, McGarvey M, Quinn BT, Dusek JA, Benson H, Rauch SL, Moore CI, Fischl B |title=Meditation experience is associated with increased cortical thickness |journal=NeuroReport |volume=16 |issue=17 |pages=1893–7 |year=2005 |pmid=16272874 |pmc=1361002 |doi=10.1097/01.wnr.0000186598.66243.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research into [[brain activity and meditation]] has shown an increase in grey matter in areas of the brain including the insular cortex.&lt;ref name="Fox 48–73"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=Kieran C.R.|author2=Nijeboer, Savannah |author3=Dixon, Matthew L. |author4=Floman, James L. |author5=Ellamil, Melissa |author6=Rumak, Samuel P. |author7=Sedlmeier, Peter |author8= Christoff, Kalina |title=Is meditation associated with altered brain structure?

Another study using voxel-based morphometry and MRI on experienced [[Vipassana meditation|Vipassana meditators]] was done to extend the findings of Lazar et al., which found increased grey matter concentrations in this and other areas of the brain in experienced meditators.&lt;ref&gt;http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/3/1/55&lt;/ref&gt;

The strongest evidence against a causative role for the insula cortex in emotion comes from Damasio et al. (2012) &lt;ref&gt;https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/23/4/833/344838&lt;/ref&gt; which showed that a patient who suffered bilateral lesions of the insula cortex expressed the full complement of human emotions, and was fully capable of emotional learning.

===Salience===
[[Functional neuroimaging]] research suggests the insula is involved in two types of [[Salience (neuroscience)|salience]]. Interoceptive information processing that links interoception with emotional salience to generate a subjective representation of the body. This involves, first, the anterior insular cortex with the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|pregenual anterior cingulate cortex]] ([[Brodmann area 33]]) and the anterior and [[posterior cingulate cortex|posterior mid-cingulate cortices]], and, second, a general [[salience network]] concerned with environmental monitoring, response selection, and skeletomotor body orientation that involves all of the insular cortex and the mid-cingulate cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Taylor KS, Seminowicz DA, Davis KD |title=Two systems of resting state connectivity between the insula and cingulate cortex |journal=Hum Brain Mapp |volume=30 |issue=9 |pages=2731–45 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19072897 |doi=10.1002/hbm.20705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative or perhaps complementary proposal is that the right anterior insular regulates the interaction between the salience of the [[selective attention]] created to achieve a task (the dorsal attention system) and the salience of [[arousal]] created to keep focused upon the relevant part of the environment (ventral attention system).&lt;ref name="Eckert"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eckert MA, Menon V, Walczak A, Ahlstrom J, Denslow S, Horwitz A, Dubno JR | year = 2009 | title = At the heart of the ventral attention system: the right anterior insula | url = | journal = Hum Brain Mapp. | volume = 30 | issue = 8| pages = 2530–41 | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20688 | pmid = 19072895 | pmc=2712290}}&lt;/ref&gt; This regulation of salience might be particularly important during challenging tasks where attention might [[Fatigue (safety)|fatigue]] and so cause careless mistakes but if there is too much arousal it risks creating poor performance by turning into [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name="Eckert"/&gt;

== Clinical significance ==

=== Progressive expressive aphasia ===
Progressive [[expressive aphasia]] is the deterioration of normal [[language function]] that causes individuals to lose the ability to communicate fluently while still being able to comprehend single words and intact other non-linguistic cognition. It is found in a variety of degenerative neurological conditions including [[Pick's disease]], [[motor neuron disease]], [[corticobasal degeneration]], [[frontotemporal dementia]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. It is associated with hypometabolism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nestor PJ, Graham NL, Fryer TD, Williams GB, Patterson K, Hodges JR |title=Progressive non-fluent aphasia is associated with hypometabolism centred on the left anterior insula |journal=Brain |volume=126 |issue=Pt 11 |pages=2406–18 |date=November 2003 |pmid=12902311 |doi=10.1093/brain/awg240 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/126/11/2406}}&lt;/ref&gt; and atrophy of the left anterior insular cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Gorno-Tempini ML, Dronkers NF, Rankin KP, etal |title=Cognition and anatomy in three variants of primary progressive aphasia |journal=Annals of Neurology |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=335–46 |date=March 2004 |pmid=14991811 |pmc=2362399 |doi=10.1002/ana.10825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Addiction ===
A number of functional brain imaging studies have shown that the insular cortex is activated when drug abusers are exposed to environmental cues that trigger cravings. This has been shown for a variety of drugs, including [[cocaine]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[opiates]], and [[nicotine]]. Despite these findings, the insula has been ignored within the drug addiction literature, perhaps because it is not known to be a direct target of the mesocortical [[dopamine]] system, which is central to current dopamine reward theories of addiction.

These individuals were found to be up to 136 times more likely to undergo a disruption of smoking addiction than smokers with damage in other areas. Disruption of addiction was evidenced by self-reported behavior changes such as quitting smoking less than one day after the brain injury, quitting smoking with great ease, not smoking again after quitting, and having no urge to resume smoking since quitting. The study was conducted on average eight years after the strokes, which opens up the possibility that [[recall bias]] could have affected the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vorel SR, Bisaga A, McKhann G, Kleber HD |title=Insula damage and quitting smoking |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5836 |pages=318–9; author reply 318–9 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17641181 |doi=10.1126/science.317.5836.318c |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17641181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent prospective studies, which overcome this limitation, have corroborated these findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.630004 | pmid=22052507 | title=Smoking Cessation 1 Year Poststroke and Damage to the Insular Cortex | journal=Stroke | date=2011 | volume=43 | issue=1 | pages=131–136 | first=R. | last=Suner-Soler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/ntr/ntt172 | title=Basal Ganglia Plus Insula Damage Yields Stronger Disruption of Smoking Addiction Than Basal Ganglia Damage Alone | journal=Nicotine | date=2013 | volume=16 | issue=4 | pages=445–453 | first=N. | last=Gaznick| pmc=3954424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests a significant role for the insular cortex in the neurological mechanisms underlying addiction to [[nicotine]] and other drugs, and would make this area of the brain a possible target for novel anti-addiction medication. In addition, this finding suggests that functions mediated by the insula, especially conscious feelings, may be particularly important for maintaining drug addiction, although this view is not represented in any modern research or reviews of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In this study, insula inactivation also disrupted "malaise" responses to [[lithium chloride]] injection, suggesting that the representation of negative interoceptive states by the insula plays a role in addiction. However, in this same study, the conditioned place preference took place immediately after the injection of amphetamine, suggesting that it is the immediate, pleasurable interoceptive effects of amphetamine administration, rather than the delayed, aversive effects of amphetamine withdrawal that are represented within the insula.

A model proposed by Naqvi et al. (see above) is that the insula stores a representation of the pleasurable interoceptive effects of drug use (e.g., the airway sensory effects of nicotine, the cardiovascular effects of amphetamine), and that this representation is activated by exposure to cues that have previously been associated with drug use. A number of functional imaging studies have shown the insula to be activated during the administration of drugs of abuse. Several functional imaging studies have also shown that the insula is activated when drug users are exposed to drug cues, and that this activity is correlated with subjective urges. In the cue-exposure studies, insula activity is elicited when there is no actual change in the level of drug in the body. Therefore, rather than merely representing the interoceptive effects of drug use as it occurs, the insula may play a role in memory for the pleasurable interoceptive effects of past drug use, anticipation of these effects in the future, or both. Such a representation may give rise to conscious urges that feel as if they arise from within the body. This may make addicts feel as if their bodies need to use a drug, and may result in persons with lesions in the insula reporting that their bodies have forgotten the urge to use, according to this study.

===Subjective certainty in ecstatic seizures===
A common quality in mystical experiences is a strong feeling of certainty which [[ineffability|cannot be expressed in words]]. Fabienne Picard proposes a neurological explanation for this subjective certainty, based on clinical research of epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Picard | first =Fabienne |title =State of belief, subjective certainty and bliss as a product of cortical dysfuntion | journal =Cortex |volume=49 | issue =9 |year=2013 |pages=2494–2500| pmid =23415878 | doi =10.1016/j.cortex.2013.01.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 =Gschwind | first1 =Markus | last2 =Picard | first2 =Fabienne | year =2016 | title =Ecstatic Epileptic Seizures: a glimpse into the multiple roles of the insula | journal =Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | volume =10 | page =21 | doi=10.3389/fnbeh.2016.00021 | pmid=26924970 | pmc=4756129}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Picard, this feeling of certainty may be caused by a dysfunction of the anterior insula, a part of the brain which is involved in [[interoception]], self-reflection, and in avoiding uncertainty about the internal representations of the world by "anticipation of resolution of uncertainty or risk". This avoidance of uncertainty functions through the comparison between predicted states and actual states, that is, "signaling that we do not understand, i.e., that there is ambiguity."&lt;ref&gt;Picard 2013, p.2496-2498&lt;/ref&gt; Picard notes that  "the concept of insight is very close to that of certainty," and refers to Archimedes' "Eureka!"&lt;ref&gt;Picard 2013, p.2497-2498&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[satori]] in Japanese Zen&lt;/ref&gt; Picard hypothesizes that during ecstatic seizures the comparison between predicted states and actual states no longer functions, and that mismatches between predicted state and actual state are no longer processed, blocking "negative emotions and negative arousal arising from predictive uncertainty," which will be experienced as emotional confidence.&lt;ref name="Picard 2013, p.2498"&gt;Picard 2013, p.2498&lt;/ref&gt; Picard concludes that "[t]his could lead to a spiritual interpretation in some individuals."&lt;ref name="Picard 2013, p.2498"/&gt;

'''Jane Lampton "Jean" Clemens''' (July 26, 1880 &amp;ndash; December 24, 1909) was the youngest of the three daughters of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known by his pen name [[Mark Twain]], and his wife [[Olivia Langdon Clemens]]. On [[Christmas Eve]] 1909, Clemens drowned in a bathtub at her father's home after an apparent seizure.

==Character and early life==
Clemens was born in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the youngest of four children born to author and humorist [[Mark Twain]] and his wife [[Olivia Langdon Clemens]].&lt;ref name="Youngblood2006"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple's first child, a son named Langdon, died of [[diphtheria]] at age 19&amp;nbsp;months. She had two older sisters: [[Susy Clemens|Susy]] and [[Clara Clemens|Clara]]. According to ''[[Mark Twain's Autobiography]]'', Jean Clemens, like her mother, was a kind-hearted person and particularly fond of animals. She founded or worked with a number of societies for the protection of animals in the various locations where she lived.&lt;ref name="Twain"&gt;{{cite web |author=Twain, Mark | year=1910| title= The Death of Jean|work=Mark Twain's Autobiography | url=http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/mtwain/bl-mtwain-deathofjean.htm |accessdate = January 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epilepsy==
She had [[epilepsy]] from age fifteen, which her father attributed to a head injury she had suffered at age eight or nine.&lt;ref name="Trombley"&gt;{{cite web |author=Trombley, Laura Skandera |year= |title=She Wanted to Kill: Jean Clemens and Postictal Psychosis |work=She Wanted to Kill: Jean Clemens and Postictal Psychosis |url=http://www.pitzer.edu/offices/president/speeches/jean_clemens.htm |accessdate=January 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902095940/http://www.pitzer.edu/offices/president/speeches/jean_clemens.htm |archivedate=September 2, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family spent years seeking cures in the United States and Europe. Twain also attributed her mood swings and sometimes erratic behavior to her uncontrolled epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Duncan, and Burns (2001), p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

Olivia Langdon Clemens tried to include her daughter in family life despite her illness, but after her death in 1904 it was left to Twain and Jean's older sister Clara to manage her and the difficulties her illness caused. Twain's secretary, [[Isabel Lyon]], claimed that on two occasions in 1906 Jean physically attacked Katy Leary, a maid for the family, and said she had wanted to kill her.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Duncan, and Burns (2001), pp. 227-230&lt;/ref&gt;  In her 2004 biography ''Dangerous Intimacy: The Untold Story of Mark Twain's Final Years'', historian Karen Lystra questioned the accuracy of Lyon's account of Jean's violent behavior and suggests that Lyon manipulated a separation between father and daughter because Lyon hoped to marry Twain.&lt;ref&gt;Lystra (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Jean was sent to an epilepsy colony in [[Katonah, New York]] in the fall of 1906 and her father denied her requests to come home, fearing that he could not care for her.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Duncan and Burns (2001), p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Twain fired Lyon and her new husband in 1909, claiming they were both guilty of embezzlement, and permitted Jean to return home in April 1909. Jean and her father seemed to get along well together, though Jean found her father stubborn and temperamental.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Duncan, and Burns (2001), p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In December 1909, Jean Clemens was staying at her father's home, [[Stormfield]] in [[Redding, Connecticut]] and had decorated the home for the upcoming [[Christmas]] holiday. On the morning of December 24, 1909, she was found dead in the bathtub.&lt;ref name="routledge"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=LeMaster, J.R. |editor2=Wilson, James D. |title=The Routledge Encyclopedia of Mark Twain|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-135-88128-6|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had apparently suffered a seizure and drowned.&lt;ref name="NYTimes1909"&gt;{{Cite news

'''Joseph Kent''' (January 14, 1779{{spaced ndash}}November 24, 1837), a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], was a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Maryland]], serving from 1833 until his death in 1837.  He also served in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], serving the [[United States House of Representatives, Maryland District 2|second district]] of Maryland from 1811 to 1815 and again from 1819 to 1826, and as the [[List of Governors of Maryland|19th Governor of Maryland]] from 1826 to 1829.

==Early life and career==
Born on January 14, 1779 in [[Calvert County, Maryland]].  He was the son of Daniel Kent, Sr. (1754–1805) and Anne Weems Wheeler (1761–1823).  Joseph Kent received a liberal schooling at Lower Marlboro Academy, and studied medicine.  He was admitted to medical practice in [[Lower Marlboro, Maryland|Lower Marlborough]], Calvert County in 1799 with a Doctor Parran, but ceased relations with Parran after a political disagreement in 1801.

==First marriage==

Joseph married first, Eleanor Lee Contee Wallace (1782–1826) on October 30, 1804.  Eleanor was born December 9, 1782 in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].  She died August 14, 1826.  Eleanor was the daughter Dr. Michael Wallace, Jr., Esq. (1749–1794) and Eleanor Lee Contee (1758–1786). Their daughter, Adelaide MacKubin Kent, would marry [[Thomas Pratt (Maryland politician)|Thomas Pratt]], another Governor of Maryland and U.S. Senator.

==Farming and medicine==

Kent purchased a {{convert|300|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate named "Rosemount" near [[Bladensburg, Maryland]], and settled there around 1807.  "Rosemount" is part of the large estate, "Park Hall", owned by the Gantt family in 1735, about which time it was divided and sold.  Joseph gave the name "Rosemount". He was passionately fond of roses and the old terraced garden was kept profusely planted with lilies and roses, justifying his choice of the new name he had given his home.

He continued the practice of medicine and also engaged in farming on his estate.  In 1807, Dr. Kent removed to the vicinity of Bladensburg and entered the Maryland State Militia as a Surgeon's mate, in the 34th Regiment of the Maryland Militia.  In 1809 he was made a full surgeon, but resigned.  In the militia, Kent received the rank of a Lieutenant Colonel, and finally as a Colonel of the Cavalry of the 2nd Maryland Militia Cavalry.

Joseph presided at the first public meeting in Washington for the organization of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]], in which he became a director.

==Politics==

Turning to politics, Joseph was elected to the United States Congress in 1810 taking his seat on March 4, 1811 and served several years until March 3, 1815.  Though a [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]], opposing [[War of 1812|War]] with Great Britain, he voted with the Republican party in declaring War.  He was a [[Presidential Elector]] in 1816, casting his vote for James Monroe (1758–1831).  He later broke with the Federalist party and by the time of the next election he was a [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican]], in which he was elected to another term in the House of Representatives from March 4, 1819 until he resigned on January 6, 1826.  In his second tenure in Congress, Kent continued as chairman of the [[United States House Committee on the District of Columbia|Committee on the District of Columbia]].

==Governor of Maryland==
Joseph was elected Governor of Maryland in 1826.  The primary goal of Kent's administration as governor was to work toward [[internal improvements]].  He was in support of improving internal transportation, including expanding the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] and the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]].  The immense cost of these projects, however, were never fully repudiated until several decades after Kent's administration, and placed the state under immense financial burden for many years aftwards.

Other areas of interest for Kent included [[prison reform]], separating presidential voting into districts, and for increased funding for schools and colleges.  He also sought to improve the maintenance of the state's records, "so indispensably necessary to its correct history" as he said.

==Second marriage==

Joseph married Alice Lee Contee (1803–1868) on July 8, 1828 at "Bromont", near Newburg, Charles Co., Maryland.  Alice was born at "Bromont", near Newburg, Charles Co., Maryland.  She died August 24, 1868.  Alice was the a first cousin of Joseph's first wife, Eleanor Lee Contee Wallace (1782–1826).  Alice was the daughter of Capt. Benjamin Contee, Rev., Hon. (1755–1815) and Sarah Russell Lee (1766–1810).

==United States Senate and later life==
Kent was elected as a Republican (later Whig) to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1833, until his death at his home, "Rosemount," near Bladensburg. He served as chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the District of Columbia|Senate Committee on the District of Columbia]] (Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Congresses).  As senator, Kent was opposed to the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]], and offered a resolution asking for negotiations with France regarding lower tobacco prices and restricting the importing of tobacco.  However, although this resolution passed, it was not widely popular.

Due to ill health, Kent attended only four sessions of the Senate, and died in 1837 as a result of a fall from his horse.  He is buried in an unmarked grave at his home of "Rosemount".

Starring Janne Hyytiäinen, [[Ilkka Koivula]], and [[Maria Järvenhelmi]] , the film was presented at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4336339/year/2006.html|title=''Laitakaupungin valot'' (''Lights in the Dusk'')|accessdate=8 July 2015|work=[[Cannes Film Festival|Festival de Cannes (Archives: 2006, Selections)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the last installment in Kaurismäki's "[[Finland]]" trilogy after ''[[Drifting Clouds (film)|Drifting Clouds]]'' ([[1996 in film|1996]]) and ''[[The Man Without a Past]]'' ([[2002 in film|2002]]).

The film is about a security guard who is set up in a robbery by a [[femme fatale]] who exploits his gullibility and loyalty. Classical music is used as background throughout much of the film, including excerpts from the work of the famous [[Swedes|Swedish]] tenor [[Jussi Björling]].

It has been argued that the film deals with the ways in which "[c]apitalism has painted the town red, just a different shade of red from its socialist connotations," as well as that "rock is so important to the director that a number of his males, including Koistinen, favor a 50s, greasy, sweptback hair style, to go along with their love of rock 'n' roll (definitely a reminder of how rock was the way to rebel in socialist countries)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708221342/http://www.austinfilm.org/page.aspx?pid=3277|url=http://www.austinfilm.org/page.aspx?pid=3277|title=''Lights in the Dusk'' (''Laitakaupungin valot''): Written, Produced, Directed, and Edited by Aki Kaurismäki|last=Nafus|first=Chale, Director of Programming, [[Austin Film Society]]|publisher=[[Austin Film Society]]|access-date=8 July 2015|archivedate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Koistinen (Janne Hyytiäinen) is a lonely nightwatchman tasked with guarding a shopping mall. He attempts to socialize, but is treated coldly by his manager and subjected to mocking by his colleagues. While he is drinking alone in a bar, he catches the eye of some criminals headed by Lindholm ([[Ilkka Koivula]]) who learn of his occupation. Koistinen's only human contact is the grill vendor Aila ([[Maria Heiskanen]]) to whom he outlines his plans of starting his own company.

While at work, Koistinen notices a dog left outside a pub without water. While he is taking a break, Mirja ([[Maria Järvenhelmi]]) approaches him, saying he seems lonely. They agree to go on a date together. Returning from his break, Koistinen meets a young boy in front of the pub and asks if he knows the owners of the dog. Despite the boy's warning, Koistinen confronts the owners in the pub and is beaten off-camera.

Koistinen and Mirja go on a date. They talk little, and at a concert Koistinen watches as Mirja goes dancing on her own with other men. Despite this, they agree to meet again. Koistinen returns to Aila's grill and talks about his evening. Insulted, Aila asks him to leave and closes shop. Meanwhile, Mirja meets with Lindholm for her payment and ridicules Koistinen. Lindholm informs his contacts of an "open-door day."

Koistinen seeks a loan to start his own business, but is harshly refused at the bank due to his insufficient education and lack of guarantors. Later, Mirja unexpectedly joins Koistinen while he is taking his rounds. While Koistinen explains the mall's security system, Mirja memorizes the security code he uses. She gives the code to Lindholm, who tells her to start cooling the fake relationship off.

Mirja meets Koistinen at his place, but abruptly leaves when he attempts to put his arm around her. Koistinen begins to drink heavily, and ends up at Aila's grill. Aila walks him home and puts him to bed.

At work, one of Koistinen's colleagues mockingly asks about his successes with women. Koistinen grabs the man, but stops himself from striking him and goes to his rounds. Mirja meets him and asks him to come and talk. Koistinen signs off and leaves with Mirja in his car. Mirja drugs Koistinen and passes his keys to one of Lindholm's contacts. Using Koistinen's keys and security code, the thieves rob a jewellery store at the mall.

The police question Koistinen, but he claims to have been alone and drunk. He is released due to lack of proof, but is fired from his job. On Lindholm's insistence, Mirja meets with Koistinen at his apartment once again to plant evidence. Koistinen notices her hiding the evidence, but does not stop her and lets himself be arrested by the police. He is sentenced to two years in prison.

Koistinen initially remains lonely in prison, tearing up a letter Aila sends him. Just as Koistinen begins to have some contact to other inmates, he is released a year early on parole. He finds lodgings at a night shelter and gets a job as a restaurant's dishwasher. He runs into Aila, but soon excuses himself. However, Aila comes to see him at the night shelter and asks about his plans for the future. When Koistinen says he plans to open a garage once he's back on his feet, she congratulates him for not losing hope. They agree to see each other again.

Koistinen sees Mirja and Lindholm at the restaurant where he is working, but does not confront them. Lindholm calls up the head waitress and tells about Koistinen's criminal record, which results in him being fired immediately. Koistinen gets a knife from the night shelter and returns to the restaurant. As Lindholm and Mirja are leaving, he attacks Lindholm, but only manages to cut his hand while being disarmed and subdued by Lindholm's thugs. The thugs offer to kill Koistinen, but Lindholm refuses, saying he is a businessman and not a murderer. The young boy who warned Koistinen earlier sees the thugs take him away and finds Aila. They discover the badly beaten Koistinen in the harbour, along with the dog Koistinen attempted to help earlier. Aila offers to get help but Koistinen asks her to stay. When she asks him not to die, Koistinen replies "I won't die yet" and puts his hand on hers.

'''Madge Blake''' (née '''Cummings'''; May 31, 1899 – February 19, 1969)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kansas.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/the-story-of-kansas/article1097544.html ''The Wichita Eagle'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/madge-blake/17747 Kansas Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[character actor|character actress]] best remembered for her roles as [[Larry Mondello]]'s mother, Margaret Mondello, on the [[CBS]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Leave it to Beaver]]'', as Flora MacMichael on the ABC/CBS sitcom ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', and as Aunt Harriet Cooper in 96 episodes of ABC's ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''. Gene Kelly had a special affection for her and included her in each of his films following her role in ''[[An American in Paris]]''.

==Early life==
Blake was born in [[Kinsley, Kansas|Kinsley]] in [[Edwards County, Kansas|Edwards County]], south-central Kansas, to Albert Cummings and the former Alice Stone. Her father was a [[Methodist]] [[Circuit rider (religious)|circuit rider]] who discouraged her from becoming an actress, thus she did not enter acting until later in life, despite her family's relocation from Kansas to [[Southern California]].

During World War II, Blake and her husband James Lincoln Blake worked in [[Utah]] on construction of the detonator for the [[atomic bomb]] and performed such jobs as testing equipment destined for the [[Manhattan Project]].{{cn|date=April 2017}} The couple received a citation for their work from the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mphpa.org/classic/COTMP/visitors_questions.htm Office of Scientific Research and Development website]; accessed May 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although five years his senior, Blake was a niece of actor [[Milburn Stone]], who filled the role of [[Doc Adams]] on [[CBS]]'s ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' [[Western (genre)|Western]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansas.com/2012/08/20/2456181/madge-blake-stood-out-in-small.html|title=Madge Blake stood out in small roles|author=Beccy Tanner|work=[[The Wichita Eagle]]|date=August 20, 2012|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did not begin to study acting until she was 50 years old, when she enrolled at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] and took advantage of whatever influence or contacts Milburn Stone had to land acting roles. In the middle 1950s, Blake appeared on [[Rod Cameron (actor)|Rod Cameron]]'s ''[[City Detective (TV series)|City Detective]]'' [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[crime drama]] and in [[Ray Milland]]'s sitcom, ''[[Meet Mr. McNutley]]'', renamed in the second season as ''The Ray Milland Show''. Blake appeared in four episodes of the NBC sitcom ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]'' (1954–1956) and twice on CBS's ''[[December Bride]]'', with [[Spring Byington]].

==Acting career==
Blake portrayed gushy gossip columnist Dora Bailey in ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952) and was a model for one of the fairies in [[Walt Disney]]'s animated version of ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959). She appeared as Mrs. Porter, a babysitter, in the 1959 pilot of CBS's ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]''. About this time, she was cast in a guest-starring role in the sitcoms, ''[[Guestward, Ho!]]'', with [[Joanne Dru]] on ABC, and ''[[Angel (1960 TV series)|Angel]]'', with [[Annie Fargé]] on CBS. In 1961, she guest-starred in the episode "A View of Murder" of the syndicated crime drama ''[[The Brothers Brannagan]]''. Blake's Flora MacMichael was a romantic foil to [[Walter Brennan]]'s Grandpa Amos McCoy on ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', a [[situation comedy]] about a [[West Virginia]] mountain family that relocated to Southern California.

Prior to her role in ''Batman'', she had a recurring role on ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' as the president of the Jack Benny Fan Club - Pasadena Chapter. She played Millie Brinkerhoff in the episode "Instant Wedding" in the 1963 NBC military drama ''[[The Lieutenant]]'' starring [[Gary Lockwood]] in the title role. Blake appeared in the pilot episode of ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'' (broadcast in the U.S in September 1964) as Miss Comstock, an official from the Addams' children's school. Blake also appeared in a memorable episode of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' in 1957 with [[George Reeves]] guest-starring as [[Superman]] and in an earlier episode in 1954 as store clerk, Mrs. Mulford. She played the mother of Joey Barnes on the Joey Bishop show from 1961 to 1964. At one point, the producers of ''Batman'' wanted to fire Blake for unknown reasons. [[Adam West]], with whom she had become friends, stood up for her and she kept her job. The next day, he found a freshly baked cake in his dressing room.

==Declining health and death==
Declining health caused Blake's role as Aunt Harriet to be reduced, and with the introduction of [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] in the third and final season of ''Batman'', she appeared in only two episodes that season in a guest role. Shortly before her death, she appeared as Mrs. Hardy in the episode "The Con Man" of the CBS sitcom, ''[[The Doris Day Show]]''.

Blake was admitted to Huntington Memorial Hospital where she passed away at age 69, the result of a heart attack. She was interred beside her mother in the family plot at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=8bOJCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=madge+blake+grand+view+memorial&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW6s3cmLzeAhXXIjQIHaDIABwQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=madge%20blake%20grand%20view%20memorial&amp;f=false ''Celebrities in Los Angeles Cemeteries'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margery Myers Strohm''' (née '''Booth'''; 1905/1906 – 11 April 1952),&lt;ref name=mail&gt;{{cite news|title=Revealed: British opera singer turned spy who performed for Hitler with secret documents hidden in her underwear|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1310484/Margery-Booth-British-opera-singer-turned-spy-performed-Hitler.html#ixzz0zA6012B3|publisher=Daily Mail|date=10 September 2010|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Margery Kallus''', was a [[British people|British]] [[opera singer]], who having married a [[German people|German]] and emigrated to Germany, became a British spy during [[World War II]], who met [[Adolf Hitler]] and sang at a British prisoner of war camp.&lt;ref name=marj&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11258623|title=WWII knicker spy Margery Booth photos to be auctioned|publisher=BBC news|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margery Myers Booth was born in Hodges Street, [[Wigan]], [[Lancashire]], the daughter of Levi and Ada (née Tetley) Booth. The family later moved to [[Southport]]. Booth trained in [[Bolton]] with R. Evans, in [[Knightsbridge]] with Eileen D'Orme, and then the [[Guildhall School of Music]], where she won a scholarship in 1925, then the Opera Scholarship and Liza Lehmann Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savill |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/7991989/British-opera-singerspy-performed-before-Hitler-with-secrets-in-her-underwear.html |title=British opera-singer/spy performed before Hitler with secrets in her underwear |publisher=Telegraph |date=2010-09-09 |accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her professional debut at the Queen's Hall, Wigan, on 4 October 1935. She then moved back to London to continue her career in [[Covent Garden]] London in 1936, but her marriage to Dr Egon Strohm, from a brewing family in the [[Schwarzwald]], took her to Germany.&lt;ref name=marj/&gt;

Her career blossomed with performances at [[Bayreuth]] and with the [[Berlin State Opera]], but she also made irregular appearances at Covent Garden. She starred as Madalene in 1936, as Flosshilde in Götterdämmerung, as the Shepherd boy in recording of [[Tosca]] with [[Hildegard Ranczak]], but was most famous for her portrayal as Carmen.&lt;ref name=marj/&gt;

At the outbreak of World War II the [[Nazi]]s mistakenly trusted her, sending her to Freigegeben (Open Prison) [[Stalag III-D]], a camp for potential recruits to the [[British Free Corps]]. There she worked with British agent and prisoner [[John Brown (British Army soldier)|John Brown]] to obtain details of traitors.&lt;ref name=marj/&gt; On one occasion she sang before Hitler just after a British officer had hidden secret documents in her dress; Hitler subsequently sent her red roses wrapped in a [[Swastika]] flag.&lt;ref name=mail/&gt;

In early 1944, she was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] as a suspected spy, and although tortured, did not reveal any information.&lt;ref name=BGaz/&gt; On release she made her way west, and was liberated in Germany by the advancing [[US Army]].&lt;ref name=BGaz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-gazette.co.uk/2010/12/30/margery-booth-george-cross/|title=Margarey Booth|publisher=British Gazette|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, information she provided was used to convict both [[Lord Haw Haw]] and [[John Amery]], both of whom were hanged for [[treason]].&lt;ref name=marj/&gt; She then returned to London, but was rejected as she was thought to have been a Nazi sympathizer.&lt;ref name=BGaz/&gt;

==Death==
Emigrating again to [[New York City|New York]], on arrival she was referred to a doctor who diagnosed her with terminal [[breast cancer]], which claimed her life in New York on 11 April 1952, aged 46 or 47.&lt;ref name=BGaz/&gt;

'''''Morning Patrol''''' ({{lang-el|Πρωϊνή Περίπολος|translit=Proini Peripolos|italic=yes}}) is a 1987 Greek drama film directed by [[Nikos Nikolaidis]]. It introduced a new iconography to Nikolaidis' work and contains several elements somewhat resembling the [[Thriller (genre)|thriller genre]] and [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karalis, Vrasidas|title=A History of Greek Cinema|publisher=New York, New York: [[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|year=2012|page=223|isbn=1441112782|URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=LBFEq35eK-EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=a+history+of+greek+cinema&amp;ved=0ahUKEwia2cSJrIfLAhWDBywKHdTyCEYQ6AEIGjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=nikolaidis%20thriller}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has an elaborate yet simple script of strongly contrasting moods. The film's dialogue contains excerpts taken from published works authored by [[Daphne du Maurier]], [[Philip K. Dick]], [[Raymond Chandler]], and [[Herman Raucher]]. It received the Best Director Award and the Greek National Ministry of Culture Award at the [[Thessaloniki Festival of Greek Cinema]] in October [[1987 in film|1987]], where [[Dinos Katsouridis]] also won the Best Cinematographer Award and Marie-Louise Bartholomew also won the Best Art Director Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiff.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&amp;page=971&amp;year=1987|script-title=el:Γενικά 1987: Βραβεία Ελληνικός κινηματογράφος|website=[[Thessaloniki International Film Festival|Διεθνές Φεστιβάλ Κινηματογράφου Θεσσαλονίκης (Πληροφορίες: Βραβεία)]]|accessdate=5 September 2014|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film went on further to be officially selected for screening at [[Fantasporto]] in February [[1989 in film|1989]] where it was nominated for the International Fantasy Film Award and it was also officially selected for screening at the [[Avoriaz#Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival|Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival]] in January [[1987 in film|1987]] where it was nominated for the Grand Prize.

==Plot==
A lonely and perplexed woman, played by future Nikolaidis mainstay Michele Valley, wanders through the ruins of a destroyed and deserted city in a post-apocalyptic era. She wonders whatever happened and where did all the residents disappear to. She does not remember much about herself, including even her own name, where is she supposed to be going, and whether she ever had any relatives.

Her searches throughout the city are not successful and no one can help her. Memories of the past come in the form of dreams and bestow upon her guidance and hope; all alone, in a mysterious and abandoned place, she finds the travel difficult. The windows and doors of the city's buildings are all open and the city is almost entirely silent, a silence violated only by the sounds coming out of a [[Movie theater|film theater]] in which the protagonist finds herself at one instance.

However, the reigning silence is only an appearance, for at times the city comes alive and becomes a dangerous place. Carelessness and gullibility can cost lives. The woman finally meets a lonely man in despair, employed as a guard, eventually finding with him the ultimate link between love and death (a theme which Nikolaidis explored in his later films).

'''Mount Olivet Cemetery''' is an historic [[cemetery]] located at 1300 Bladensburg Road, NE in [[Washington, D.C.]] It is maintained by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington]]. The largest Catholic burial ground in the District of Columbia, it was one of the first in the city to be racially integrated.

==About the cemetery==
[[File:Looking NE at Chapel main door - section 76-77 - Mt Olivet - Washington DC - 2014.jpg|thumb|Chapel at Mount Olivet Cemetery.]]
On June 5, 1852, the Council of the City of Washington in the District of Columbia passed a [[local ordinance]] that barred the creation of new cemeteries anywhere within [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] or the area bounded by [[Florida Avenue|Boundary Street]] (northwest and northeast), 15th Street (east), [[East Capitol Street]], the [[Anacostia River]], the [[Potomac River]], and [[Rock Creek (Potomac River)|Rock Creek]]. Existing Catholic cemeteries at [[Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle|St. Matthew's Church]], St. Patrick Catholic Church, and St. Peter Catholic Church were nearly full. A number of new cemeteries were therefore established in the "rural" areas in and around Washington: [[Columbian Harmony Cemetery]] in D.C.; [[Gate of Heaven Cemetery (Silver Spring, Maryland)|Gate of Heaven Cemetery]] in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]]; [[Glenwood Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Glenwood Cemetery]] in D.C.; and [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson,  p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; Father Charles I. White, the 51-year-old priest who had led St. St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Church since 1857, was the individual most responsible for the creation of Mt. Olivet.&lt;ref&gt;"A Good Priest at Rest." ''Washington Post.'' April 2, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cemetery was created in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;"Archbishop to Dedicate Cemetery." ''Washington Post.'' June 16, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Truett304" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;At least one source says the cemetery was created in 1857. See: Richardson,  p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore]], which then covered the District of Columbia, purchased {{convert|40|acre|km2}} of Fenwick Farm for the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Rash, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; A gray stone lodge was built to mark the entrance.&lt;ref name="Truett304"&gt;Truett, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the burial grounds at St. Matthew's, St. Patrick, and St. Peter churches were all full by that time, a number of graves were moved to the newly-established Mount Olivet in order to make room at the old cemeteries for new burials.&lt;ref&gt;Truett, p. 305; Bergheim, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mount Auburn Cemetery]], a [[rural cemetery]] near [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], was the model for Mount Olivet.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Mount Olivet was known as one of the "big five" cemeteries in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;The others were [[Congressional Cemetery]], Glenwood Cemetery, [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Oak Hill Cemetery]], and [[Rock Creek Cemetery]]. See: Richardson,  p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the start, Mount Olivet was racially integrated. Most cemeteries in the city were not.  More than 7,700 African Americans were buried at Mount Olivet between 1800 and 1919 (about 7.6 percent of all African American burials in the city). In comparison, 24,000 Caucasians were buried there during the same period. Mount Olivet remains the only racially integrated cemetery from the 19th century to remain active as of 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson,  p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with ''Whose Life Is It Anyway?''==
Both ''Nevis Mountain Dew'' and [[Brian Clark (writer)|Brian Clark's]] ''[[Whose Life Is It Anyway? (play)|Whose Life Is It Anyway?]]'' were selected as one of the ten best plays of the 1978–1979 season in [[New York City]]. Each play tackles the subject of [[euthanasia]] through the eyes of a man that has become paralyzed.  Otis L. Guernsey Jr., editor of ''The Best Plays of 1978–1979'' theatre yearbook, which recognized the two productions that season, made the following observation:&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Nevis Mountain Dew'' of course invites comparison with this season's British script on much the same subject, ''[[Whose Life Is It Anyway? (play)|Whose Life Is It Anyway?]]'', and the [[Negro Ensemble Company|NEC]] variation on this theme holds its own.  It doesn't confront its invalid's question "To be or not to be?" as polemically as its British counterpart, but it takes a similar stand and a closer look at the effects of such a {{sic|prolongued}} calamity on those surrounding the victim."&lt;ref name='Plays-1978-1979-Comparison'&gt;{{cite book |title=The Best Plays of 1978–1979 |last=Guernsey Jr. (Ed.)|first=Otis L. |year=1979 |publisher= [[Dodd, Mead &amp; Company]]|location= New York &amp; Toronto|isbn=0-396-07723-4 |pages=28–29 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Prehistoric Planet''''' is a revision of the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'' and ''[[Walking with Beasts]]'' series, done by [[Discovery Channel]] and [[NBC]] for the [[Discovery Family|Discovery Kids]] network. Though the producers kept most of the original [[animation]], David Bock and Peter Sherman wrote new text for a younger target audience, narrated by [[Ben Stiller]] (in Season 1) and [[Christian Slater]] (in Season 2), and interspersed the scenes with occasional [[quizzes]] to act as bumpers around the commercial breaks. New [[music]] was incorporated as well. Most marketing and advertising for the series focused on the [[dinosaur]] [[episode]]s. In addition, the final episode, the ''Prehistoric Planet Top 10'' focused solely on the creatures from ''Walking With Dinosaurs''. Most of the graphic content from the shows were removed to be more appropriate for children, small content edits were also done to allow original programs to fit in the 23 minutes of non-commercial time that a normal half-hour program has on network TV, resulting in footage from the shows to be trimmed down. Only Season 1 has been released on [[home video]] and [[DVD]].

===Finnish Eurovision Song Contest selections (2011, 2016, 2018)===
Saara Aalto took part on two separate occasions in the selection process in a bid to represent Finland in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. She participated in the qualifying rounds in Finland for [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|Eurovision 2011]] with her self-penned song "[[:fi:Blessed with Love|Blessed with Love]]", placing second to [[Paradise Oskar]] who went on to represent Finland with his song "[[Da Da Dam]]".

Her second bid to represent Finland was for [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]] through the competition ''[[Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu]]'' where she sang another of her own compositions titled "No Fear", again placing second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/ensimmaiset_umk-finalistit_valittu__onko_joku_heista_suomen_euroviisuedustaja/8654646|title=Ensimmäiset UMK-finalistit valittu – onko joku heistä Suomen euroviisuedustaja?|publisher=Yle |date=6 February 2016 |accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although winning the public vote, she was disadvantaged with the judging vote going to the eventual winner [[Sandhja]] who went on to represent Finland with the song "[[Sing It Away]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UMK 2016: FINLAND REVEALS FULL RESULTS OF TELEVOTE AND JURIES|url=http://wiwibloggs.com/2016/03/02/umk-2016-full-results-revealed/129687/|publisher=wiwibloggs.com |accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview Aalto described her music.&lt;ref name=Rojas/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I call my music Epic Love Pop! I love dramatic and emotional music with a show feeling. I also want to bring love, joy and encouragement for everybody; be yourself and inspire others! I’ve studied piano since I was a little kid and through music schools, singing competitions, my career and concerts (in Finland and all over the world) I’ve gotten lots of experience and confidence to be who I am as an artist. (...) I’ve performed in musicals and big shows in Finland. (...) I’m happy to be versatile performer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Saara Aalto represented Finland in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018]]. The decision was made by the Finnish national broadcaster [[Yleisradio|Yle]]. Her song was selected among three choices in a national final; the selected song was "Monsters". She qualified for the final on 8th May but finished second last (25th) on 12th May.

===Success in China===
Following her performance of "Blessed with Love" for qualification in Eurovision 2011, that December she was involved in the Santa Claus Season's Greetings Song Contest, where she sang "Ai De Zhu Fu," a Chinese (Mandarin) version of her Eurovision song "Blessed with Love". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finland.cn/Public/default.aspx?contentid=236100&amp;nodeid=35178&amp;culture=en-US |title=Chinese listeners to vote for best Finnish SANTA CLAUS SEASON'S GREETINGS SONG 2012 |publisher=Finland.cn |date= |accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finland.cn/public/default.aspx?contentid=237411&amp;nodeid=35178&amp;contentlan=1&amp;culture=fi-FI |title=Negative voitti joululaulukilpailun |website = Suomen suurlähetystö, Peking -Suomen pääkonsulaatti, Shanghai |language = Finnish|publisher=Finland.cn |date=29 December 2011 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finding great reception from Chinese audiences, in July 2013 Aalto went on to release a full album destined for [[Mainland China]] and other Chinese markets also titled ''Ai De Zhu Fu''. On the album she performed nine of the album's 13 tracks in [[Mandarin language]].

===''The Voice of Finland'' (2012)===
Aalto participated in [[The Voice of Finland (season 1)|season one]] of ''[[The Voice of Finland]]''. In the blind auditions, broadcast on 6 February 2012 on the Finnish commercial television channel [[Nelonen]], she performed "[[Taking Chances (song)|Taking Chances]]" from [[Celine Dion]] with all four coaches, [[Elastinen]], [[Lauri Tähkä]], [[Paula Koivuniemi]] and [[Michael Monroe]] turning their chairs. She opted to be part of Team Monroe.

In the Battle Round on 17 February, she was confronted with team competitor Anna Inginmaa, both singing "[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]". Coach Monroe opted for Aalto to go to the next round. In the live show on 23 March, she sang "[[Barracuda (song)|Barracuda]]" and was saved by Monroe after failing to get enough votes from the public. She followed it up with the French language "Je suis malade" from [[Serge Lama]] and was safe after the public vote. In the semifinals with her rendition of "[[Over the Rainbow]]", she qualified for the finals held on 20 April where she sang "[[I'm Gonna Be Strong]]" from [[Frankie Laine]] and an original song titled "My Love". She placed second to winner Mikko Sipola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/viihde/2012020315152992_vi.shtml |title=Voice of Finland: Riitaa laulajista! &amp;#124; Viihde |publisher=Iltalehti.fi |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The X Factor UK'', Eurovision Song Contest and ''Wild Wild Wonderland''===
Aalto auditioned for the [[The X Factor (UK series 13)|thirteenth UK series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in 2016, singing a cover of [[Sia Furler|Sia]]'s "[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]", which earned her three yeses from the attending judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiwibloggs.com/2016/08/28/finlands-saara-aalto-nails-x-factor-uk-audition/149412/|title="That's How You Do It!"

At the six-chair challenge, she performed "[[I See Fire]]" by [[Ed Sheeran]] and was sent home by Osbourne who stated a lack of connection. However, after the crowd chanted to bring her back, Aalto was given a chance to perform [[Serge Lama]]'s "[[Je suis malade (song)|Je suis malade]]", which caused the crowd to turn on her, while [[Nicole Scherzinger]] criticized her song choice, stating "we ain't in France". Osbourne then asked Aalto to leave. 

Aalto was brought back as Scherzinger's wildcard pick for the over-25s category and therefore went to judges' houses. She was chosen to proceed to the live shows after performing [[ABBA]]'s "[[The Winner Takes It All]]". In week 1 of the live shows, Aalto finished in the bottom three after performing "[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]" and faced a sing-off against the duo Bratavio, where she performed "[[Alive (Sia song)|Alive]]" by Sia. Aalto was saved with only [[Louis Walsh]] voting to eliminate her, though praising her performance. The following week, she sang "[[River Deep – Mountain High]]" and finished again in the bottom three, performing "[[Run (Snow Patrol song)|Run]]" by [[Snow Patrol]] in a sing-off against Freddy Parker. The result went to deadlock and Aalto was saved as she had the greater public vote. In week 3 she performed "[[It's Oh So Quiet]]" coming 2nd in the public vote, and in week 4 Aalto sang "[[Bad Romance]]", placing 3rd in the public vote. In week 5, Aalto finished in the bottom three for the third time after her rendition of "[[Sound of the Underground (song)|Sound of the Underground]]", but was saved by majority vote after performing "[[Who You Are (Jessie J song)|Who You Are]]" in a sing-off against the group Four of Diamonds. Her following performances were "[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)]]" in week 6 placing 2nd and "[[My Heart Will Go On]]" in week 7 again placing 2nd. In week 8, she sang "The Winner Takes It All" and a medley of "[[Diamonds Are Forever (soundtrack)|Diamonds Are Forever]]" and "[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]", topping the public vote for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voting stats 2016 revealed |url=http://www.itv.com/xfactor/news/voting-stats-2016|website=[[Itv.com|ITV]]|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the eliminations of Relley C in week 3 and Honey G in week 8, Aalto became Osbourne's last remaining act in the competition.

In the semifinals on 3 December, she sang a medley of "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]" and "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]", and "Chandelier" as 2nd song, topping the vote again reaching the Final 3, where on 10 December she performed "[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]" and "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", the latter as a duet with [[Adam Lambert]], again topping the public vote. With the elimination of the group [[5 After Midnight]] she was in the Final 2 facing [[Matt Terry]]. In the Final on 11 December, she performed "It's Oh So Quiet" and "[[I Didn't Know My Own Strength (Whitney Houston song)|I Didn't Know My Own Strength]]".

'''Samad Behrangi''' ({{lang-fa|صمد بهرنگی}}) June 24, 1939 - August 31, 1967) was an Iranian teacher, social critic, folklorist, translator, and short story writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hillmann |first=Michael. |title=Samad Behrangi |publisher=Encyclopaedia Iranica |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v4f1/v4f1a067.html }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is famous for his children's books, particularly ''[[The Little Black Fish]]''. Influenced by predominantly leftist ideologies that were common among the Iranian intelligentsia of his era, his books typically portrayed the lives of the children of the urban poor and encouraged the individual to change his/ her circumstances by her own initiatives.

==Life==
He was born in [[Tabriz]] to a lower-class Iranian Azerbaijani family. Son to Ezzat and Sara, he had two other brothers and three sisters. His father was seasonal worker and his income was never sufficient, who eventually left Iran for the Caucasus and never returned. He finished elementary school and three years of secondary school before enrolling in a teacher training school, finishing the program in 1957. Thus, only receiving few years of education, at the age of 18, he became a teacher, and continued to be so for the rest of his life, in East Azerbaijan. In the next eleven years, while teaching [[Persian language|Persian]] in rural schools of [[Iranian Azerbaijan]], he attained a B.A. degree in English from [[Tabriz University]].&lt;ref&gt;Hillmann.&lt;/ref&gt; 
He Started publishing stories in 1960, his first being ''Adat'' "Custom". He carried on writing stories, along translating from English and Turkish to Persian, and Persian to Turkish.
Later, claiming that he was impolite, he was dismissed from his high school teaching post and assigned to an elementary school. Then, as his cultural works increased, he was accused and pursued, and suspended of teaching. After a while his sentence was called off and he returned to schools.
Later, he attended student protests.

However, he was not allowed to publish his works in [[Azeri language|Azeri]], so he had to translate them into Persian in order to make them available in [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Authors/Behrangi.html A Brief Note on Samad Behrangi's Life] by [[Iraj Bashiri]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from children's stories, he wrote many [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] essays and collected and published several samples of oral [[Azerbaijani literature]]. His folklore studies have usually been done with the help of his colleague [[Behrooz Dehghani]], who helped publish some of Behrangi's works after his early death. Behrangi also has a few Azeri translations from [[Persian language|Persian]] poems by [[Ahmad Shamlou]], [[Forough Farrokhzad]], and [[Mehdi Akhavan-Sales]].

Apart from Children's Stories, he wrote many [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] essays and collected and published several samples of oral [[Azeri language|Azerbaijani]] literature. His folklore studies have usually been done with the help of his colleague [[Behrooz Dehghani]], who helped publish some of Behrangi's works after his early death. Behrangi also has a few [[Azeri language]] translations of [[Persian language|Persian]] poems by [[Ahmad Shamlou]], [[Forough Farrokhzad]], and [[Mehdi Akhavan-Sales]].

==Death==
Behrangi drowned in the [[Aras river]] and his death was blamed on the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranchamber.com/literature/sbehrangi/samad_behrangi.php Samad Behrangi]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that an army officer, Hamzeh Farahati, was seen with him when he drowned. Yet the army officer was Samad Behrangi's close friend and shared his Leftist views. Farahati in his [http://www.bbc.com/persian/arts/story/2006/11/061120_mv-mb-samad-hamze.shtml book] and in an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KggJoJ0-Tsw interview with VOA] has unequivocally confirmed that Samad drowned and was not killed by SAVAK. Cultural society, people like Al-e Ahmad and Saedi, found it hard to accept his death. But some, in particular Behrouz Dowlat-abadi, also said that Samad did not know how to swim (which was confirmed by a native, Hosein Hosein-zadeh) and that was the cause of his death. This, in turn, brought up the point that everyone was just quoting Behrouz Dowlat-abadi and that no investigation was done.

==Some of his works==
*''[[The Little Black Fish]]''
* ''Investigations into the Educational Problems of Iran'' (کندوکاو در مسائل تربیتی ایران )
* ''Ulduz and the talking doll''
* ''Ulduz and the crows''
* ''Talkhoon''
* ''One peach and 1000 peaches''
* The Complete Stories of Behrang, publishers, Persian Culture &amp; Art Institute, Vancouver and Zagros Publications, Montreal, Canada

==Quotations==

"so easily can death call on me but I have to keep up living as long as I can. However, if I face the death some day_ that I will_ doesn't matter. What matters is the effect of my life and death on others'."{{cn|date=September 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4776">{{Gnosticism}}
'''Second Treatise of the Great Seth''' is an [[apocryphal]] [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] writing discovered in the Codex VII of the [[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi codices]] and dates to around the third century. The author is unknown, and the Seth referenced in the title appears nowhere in the text. Instead Seth is thought to reference the third son of Adam and Eve to whom gnosis was first revealed, according to some gnostics. The author appears to belong to a group of gnostics who maintain that [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] was not [[crucifixion|crucified]] on the [[Christian cross|cross]]. Instead the text says that [[Simon of Cyrene]] was mistaken for Jesus and crucified in his place. Jesus is described as standing by and "laughing at their ignorance."

Those who believe Jesus to have [[crucifixion of Jesus|died on the cross]] are said to believe in "a doctrine of a dead man." All those without [[gnosis]] - including those who had what would become orthodox beliefs, as well as the figures of Adam, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Solomon, the prophets, and Moses - are all referred to as a "laughingstock." The text shows the derision which the gnostics felt towards those who did not realize their claimed truth; that the biblical text was false (in at least certain important respects) and that the God of the Jews was not the true God. 

The Treatise of the Great Seth is written from the first-person perspective of Jesus.

Some Gnostics believed Jesus was not a man but a [[docetism|docetistic]] spirit, and therefore could not die. From the translation by Roger A. Bullard and Joseph A. Gibbons:

{{quote|For my death, which they think happened, (happened) to them in their error and blindness, since they nailed their man unto their death... It was another, their father, who drank the gall and the vinegar; it was not I. They struck me with the reed; it was another, Simon, who bore the cross on his shoulder. I[t] was another upon Whom they placed the crown of thorns... And I was laughing at their ignorance.|(Jesus as narrator)}}

At the beginning of the book, Jesus states:

{{quote|I visited a bodily dwelling. I cast out the one who was in it previously, and I went in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart|title=Lost Scriptures|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=82–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This statement indicates that Jesus inhabited a human body that had previously belonged to someone else, which meant the body was not his own.

He also explains that the being that created the world is not the One True God. Jesus instead proclaims:

{{quote|Though we mastered his doctrine in this way, he lives in conceit, and he does not agree with our Father. And thus through our friendship we prevailed over his doctrine, since he is arrogant in conceit and does not agree with our Father. For he was a laughingstock with (his) judgment and false prophesy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart|title=Lost Scriptures|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=82–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This demonstrates the gnostic view that the God of the Hebrew Bible was not the One True God, but rather an inferior being called the Demiurge, which was created by [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]].

Jesus also makes statements claiming that Adam, Moses, and John the Baptist were all also "laughingstocks". He says:

{{quote|Neither he nor those before him, from Adam to Moses and John the Baptist, none of them knew me or my brethren. For a doctrine of angels is what arose from them, to keep dietary rules and bitter slavery. They never knew truth nor will they know it, for there is a great deception upon their soul...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart|title=Lost Scriptures|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=82–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He says these prominent figures were "laughingstocks" because they believed that the [[Demiurge]] was the One True God, and did not know the Gnostic truth.

'''Siegfried Rauch''' (2 April 1932 – 11 March 2018&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/siegfried-rauch-dead-steve-mcqueens-racing-rival-le-mans-was-85-1093794&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Cinema of Germany|German film]] and [[Television in Germany|television actor]]. In a career spanning over 60 years, he appeared in several international film productions  and had leading roles in numerous German television productions.

==Career==
Siegfried Rauch was born in [[Landsberg am Lech]], [[Upper Bavaria]]. He studied drama at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] and also attended private drama lessons. He began performing in theatres in 1958, beginning with [[Bremen]] (until 1962), and followed by [[Berlin]], [[Munich]] and [[Hamburg]].

In the 1970s, Rauch appeared in the 1970 [[Hollywood]] film ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'' as Captain Steiger. In ''[[Le Mans (film)|Le Mans]]'' (1971), Rauch played the race driver Erich Stahler who is [[Steve McQueen]]'s rival. In [[Samuel Fuller]]'s ''[[The Big Red One]]'', Rauch played a German army sergeant, the counterpart of Lee Marvin's character, who experiences the same events as Marvin only from a German perspective. Other Hollywood productions in which Rauch appeared were ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (film)|The Eagle Has Landed]]'' (1976) and ''[[Escape to Athena]]'' (1979).

His most famous leading role on 1970s German television was ''Thomas Lieven'' in ''[[Es muss nicht immer Kaviar sein (TV series)|Es muss nicht immer Kaviar sein]]'' (It Can't Always Be Caviar), based on the spy novel by [[Johannes Mario Simmel]]. His various other roles on television propelled his career as an actor in Germany.

From 1999 Rauch had one of the leading roles as the captain on ''[[Das Traumschiff]]'', one of the most-watched television series in Germany. In this role he was preceded by [[Heinz Weiss]] and succeeded by [[Sascha Hehn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sascha Hehn follows Siegfried Rauch as captain of "Traumschiff"|url=https://www.derwesten.de/kultur/fernsehen/sascha-hehn-folgt-siegfried-rauch-als-traumschiff-kapitaen-id7182143.html|accessdate=10 October 2012|newspaper=Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared regularly in other German TV productions, including ''[[Der Bergdoktor (2008)|Der Bergdoktor]]'', and remained active until his death.

==Personal life==
Siegfried Rauch, also known as "Sigi", lived near [[Weilheim in Oberbayern|Weilheim]] in the [[Bavarian Alps]]. Rauch was married to Karin and had two sons. [[Steve McQueen]] was the godfather of his son Jakob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/auto/fahrkultur/kultfilm-le-mans-mit-steve-mcqueen-ziggy-und-der-king-of-cool-a-1087227.html|title=Steve McQueens Kultfilm "Le Mans": "Lass die anderen quasseln"|first=Christoph|last=Stockburger|date=15 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rauch died on 11 March 2018 from sudden heart failure which caused him to fall down stairs at a fire station near his home in [[Obersöchering]] near Munich. He was 85 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/1.5489440|title=Nach Treppensturz: „Traumschiff“-Kapitän Siegfried Rauch ist tot|date=12 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018|via=www.faz.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tz.de/tv/siegfried-rauch-gestorben-todesursache-steht-jetzt-fest-zr-9685416.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fornham Hall.jpg|thumb|Fornham Hall, c.1820]]
In 1762 he succeeded his mother's brother to the [[Fornham Hall|Fornham]] estate at Fornham St Genevieve, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk and formally adopted the name of Kent. He employed architect [[James Wyatt]] to design and build a large new house ([[Fornham Hall]]) on the site in the 1770s.

He was selected [[High Sheriff of Suffolk]] for 1781–82 and created a baronet in August 1782. He was elected to serve in Parliament as the MP for [[Thetford (UK Parliament constituency)|Thetford]] from 1784 to 1790.

He died in 1811. He had married in 1771, Mary, the daughter and coheiress of Josias Wordsworth of Wadworth, Yorkshire and Sevenscore, Kent. They had a son, Sir Charles Egleton Kent, 2nd Baronet, who succeeded him, and 3 daughters.

'''Starvation response''' in animals is a set of adaptive [[biochemical]] and [[physiological]] changes that reduce [[metabolism]] in response to a lack of food.&lt;ref name="wang2006"&gt;Adapted from [[#wang2006|Wang et al. 2006]], p 223.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=By how much is metabolism reduced?|date=January 2018}}

Equivalent or closely related terms include '''famine response''', '''starvation mode''', '''famine mode''', '''starvation resistance''', '''starvation tolerance''', '''adapted starvation''', '''adaptive thermogenesis''', '''fat adaptation''', and '''metabolic adaptation'''.

[[Starvation]] contributes to tolerance during infection, as nutrients become limited when they are sequestered by host defenses and consumed by proliferating bacteria. One of the most important causes of starvation induced tolerance in vivo is [[biofilm]] growth, which occurs in many chronic infections. Starvation in biofilms is due to nutrient consumption by cells located on the periphery of biofilm clusters and by reduced diffusion of substrates through the biofilm. Biofilm bacteria shows extreme tolerance to almost all antibiotic classes, and supplying limiting substrates can restore sensitivity.

==In humans==
''Starvation mode'' is a state in which the body responds to prolonged periods of low energy intake. During short periods of energy abstinence, the human body burns primarily free fatty acids from body fat stores, along with small amounts of muscle tissue to provide required glucose for the brain.  After prolonged periods of starvation the body has depleted its body fat and begins to burn primarily lean tissue and muscle as a fuel source.

Ordinarily, the body responds to reduced energy intake by burning fat reserves and consuming muscle and other tissues. Specifically, the body burns fat after first exhausting the contents of the digestive tract along with glycogen reserves stored in liver cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthpromoting.com/learning-center/articles/therapeutic-fasting Therapeutic Fasting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After prolonged periods of starvation, the body uses the proteins within muscle tissue as a fuel source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ask an Expert: Fasting and starvation mode |author=Sarah C. Couch|date=7 April 2006 |publisher=University of Cincinnati (NetWellness) |url=http://www.netwellness.org/question.cfm/37350.htm |archivedate=19 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719031803/http://www.netwellness.org/question.cfm/37350.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnitude and composition===

The magnitude and composition of the starvation response (i.e. metabolic adaptation) was estimated in a study of 8 individuals living in isolation in [[Biosphere 2]] for two years. During their isolation, they gradually lost an average of 15% (range: 9–24%) of their body weight due to harsh conditions. On emerging from isolation, the eight isolated individuals were compared with a 152-person control group that initially had had similar physical characteristics. On average, the starvation response of the individuals after isolation was a 180 kCal reduction in daily [[total energy expenditure]]. 60 kCal of the starvation response was explained by a reduction in [[fat-free mass]] and [[fat mass]].  An additional 65 kCal was explained by a reduction in [[fidgeting]]. The remaining 55 kCal was statistically insignificant.&lt;ref name="Weyer"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid= 11010936|year=2000 |last1=Weyer |first1=Christian |last2=Walford |first2=Roy L |last3=Harper |first3=Inge T S |last4=Milner |first4=Mike A |last5=MacCallum |first5=Taber |last6=Tataranni |first6=P Antonio |last7=Ravussin |first7=Eric |title=Energy metabolism after 2 y of energy restriction: the Biosphere 2 experiment |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=946–953 |journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== General ====
The energetic requirements of a body are composed of the [[basal metabolic rate]] and the [[physical activity level]]. This caloric requirement can be met with protein, fat, carbohydrates, alcohol, or a mixture of those. [[Glucose]] is the general metabolic fuel, and can be metabolized by any cell. [[Fructose]] and some other nutrients can only be metabolized in the liver, where their metabolites transform into either glucose stored as [[glycogen]] in the liver and in muscles, or into [[fatty acids]] stored in adipose tissue.

Because of the [[blood–brain barrier]], getting nutrients to the human [[brain]] is especially dependent on molecules that can pass this barrier. The brain itself consumes about 18% of the basal metabolic rate: on a total intake of 1800 kcal/day, this equates to 324 kcal, or about 80 g of glucose. About 25% of total body glucose consumption occurs in the brain.

Glucose can be obtained directly from dietary sugars and by the breakdown of other [[carbohydrates]]. In the absence of dietary sugars and carbohydrates, glucose is obtained from the breakdown of stored [[glycogen]]. Glycogen is a readily-accessible storage form of glucose, stored in notable quantities in the liver and in small quantities in the muscles.

When the glycogen reserve is depleted, glucose can be obtained from the breakdown of fats from [[adipose tissue]]. Fats are broken down into [[glycerol]] and free fatty acids, with the glycerol being turned into glucose in the liver via the [[Gluconeogenesis#Pathway|gluconeogenesis pathway]].

When even the glucose made from glycerol reserves start declining, the liver starts producing [[ketone bodies]]. Ketone bodies are short-chain derivatives of the free fatty acids mentioned in the previous paragraph, and can cross the blood–brain barrier, meaning they can be used by the brain as an alternative metabolic fuel. [[Fatty acids]] can be used directly as an energy source by most tissues in the body.

==== Timeline ====
After the exhaustion of the glycogen reserve, and for the next 2–3 days, fatty acids are the principal metabolic fuel. At first, the brain continues to use glucose, because, if a non-brain tissue is using fatty acids as its metabolic fuel, the use of glucose in the same tissue is switched off.  Thus, when fatty acids are being broken down for energy, all of the remaining glucose is made available for use by the brain.

After 2 or 3 days of fasting, the liver begins to synthesize ketone bodies from precursors obtained from fatty acid breakdown. The brain uses these ketone bodies as fuel, thus cutting its requirement for glucose. After fasting for 3 days, the brain gets 30% of its energy from ketone bodies. After 4 days, this goes up to 75%.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Coffee, Quick Look: Metabolism, Hayes Barton Press, Dec 1, 2004, p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the production of ketone bodies cuts the brain's glucose requirement from 80 g per day to about 30 g per day. Of the remaining 30 g requirement, 20 g per day can be produced by the liver from glycerol (itself a product of fat breakdown). This still leaves a deficit of about 10 g of glucose per day that must come from some other source. This other source is the body's own proteins.

After several days of fasting, all cells in the body begin to break down [[protein]]. This releases [[amino acids]] into the bloodstream, which can be converted into glucose by the liver. Since much of our muscle mass is protein, this phenomenon is responsible for the wasting away of muscle mass seen in [[starvation]].

However, the body can selectively decide which cells break down protein and which do not. About 2–3 g of protein must be broken down to synthesize 1 g of glucose; about 20–30 g of protein is broken down each day to make 10 g of glucose to keep the brain alive. However, to conserve protein, this number may decrease the longer the fasting.

Starvation ensues when the fat reserves are completely exhausted and protein is the only fuel source available to the body. Thus, after periods of starvation, the loss of body protein affects the function of important organs, and death results, even if there are still fat reserves left unused. (In a leaner person, the fat reserves are depleted earlier, the protein depletion occurs sooner, and therefore death occurs sooner.)

The ultimate cause of death is, in general, [[cardiac arrhythmia]] or [[cardiac arrest]] brought on by tissue degradation and [[electrolyte]] imbalances.

In very obese persons, it has been shown that proteins can be depleted first and death from starvation is predicted to occur before fat reserves are used up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9665093 | volume=68 | issue=1 | title=Protein, fat, and carbohydrate requirements during starvation: anaplerosis and cataplerosis. | date=Jul 1998 | journal=Am J Clin Nutr | pages=12–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (There is nothing in the study about any of the five subjects dying.)

===Biochemistry===

During starvation, less than half the energy used by the brain comes from metabolized glucose. Because the human brain can use [[ketone bodies]] as major fuel sources, the body is not forced to break down [[skeletal muscles]] at a high rate, thereby maintaining both [[cognitive function]] and mobility for up to several weeks. This response is extremely important in [[human evolution]] and allowed for humans to continue to find food effectively even in the face of prolonged starvation.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, GF and Veech, RL (2003) Ketoacids?  Good Medicine?, Trans Am Clin Clim Assoc, 114, 149-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the level of [[insulin]] in circulation drops and the levels of [[glucagon]], [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] rise.&lt;ref&gt;Zauner, C., Schneeweiss, B., Kranz, A., Madl, C., Ratheiser, K., Kramer, L., ... &amp; Lenz, K. (2000). Resting energy expenditure in short-term starvation is increased as a result of an increase in serum norepinephrine. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 71(6), 1511-1515.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, there is an up-regulation of [[glycogenolysis]], [[gluconeogenesis]], [[lipolysis]], and [[ketogenesis]]. The body’s glycogen stores are consumed in about 24 hours. In a normal 70&amp;nbsp;kg adult, only about 8,000 kilojoules of glycogen are stored in the body (mostly in the [[striated muscle]]s).The body also engages in gluconeogenesis to convert glycerol and glucogenic amino acids into glucose for metabolism. Another adaptation is the [[Cori cycle]], which involves shuttling lipid-derived energy in glucose to peripheral glycolytic tissues, which in turn send the [[lactic acid|lactate]] back to the [[liver]] for resynthesis to glucose. Because of these processes, blood glucose levels remain relatively stable during prolonged starvation.

However, the main source of energy during prolonged starvation is derived from [[triglycerides]]. Compared to the 8,000 kilojoules of stored glycogen, lipid fuels are much richer in energy content, and a 70&amp;nbsp;kg adult stores over 400,000 kilojoules of triglycerides (mostly in adipose tissue).&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Nancy. Nancy Clark's Sports Nutrition Guidebook. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics, 2008. pg. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Triglycerides are broken down to fatty acids via lipolysis. Epinephrine precipitates lipolysis by activating [[protein kinase A]], which phosphorylates [[Hormone-sensitive lipase|hormone sensitive lipase (HSL)]] and [[perilipin]]. These enzymes, along with CGI-58 and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), complex at the surface of lipid droplets. The concerted action of ATGL and HSL liberates the first two fatty acids. Cellular [[Monoacylglycerol lipase|monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL)]], liberates the final fatty acid. The remaining glycerol enters gluconeogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yamaguchi| year = 2004 | title = CGI-58 interacts with perilipin and is localized to lipid droplets. Possible involvement of CGI-58 mislocalization in Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome | url = | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 279 | issue = | pages = 30490–30497 | doi=10.1074/jbc.m403920200|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fatty acids by themselves cannot be used as a direct fuel source. They must first undergo [[beta oxidation]] in the mitochondria (mostly of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and liver cells). Fatty acids are transported into the [[mitochondria]] as an [[carnitine|acyl-carnitine]] via the action of the enzyme CAT-1. This step controls the [[metabolic flux]] of beta oxidation. The resulting acetyl-CoA enters the [[TCA cycle]] and undergoes [[oxidative phosphorylation]] to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. The body invests some of this ATP in gluconeogenesis to produce more glucose.&lt;ref&gt;Zechner, R, Kienesberger, PC, Haemmerle, G, Zimmermann, R and Lass, A (2009) Adipose triglyceride lipase and the lipolytic catabolism of cellular fat stores, J Lipid Res, 50, 3-21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Triglycerides]] and [[Long chain fatty acids|long-chain fatty acids]] are too hydrophobic to cross into brain cells, so the liver must convert them into [[Short chain fatty acids|short-chain fatty acids]] and [[ketone bodies]] through [[ketogenesis]].  The resulting [[ketone bodies]], [[acetoacetate]] and [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|β-hydroxybutyrate]], are [[Amphiphile|amphipathic]] and can be transported into the brain (and muscles) and broken down into [[acetyl-CoA]] for use in the TCA cycle. [[Acetoacetic acid|Acetoacetate]] breaks down spontaneously into acetone, and the acetone is released through the urine and lungs to produce the “acetone breath” that accompanies prolonged fasting. The brain also uses glucose during starvation, but most of the body’s glucose is allocated to the skeletal muscles and red blood cells. The cost of the brain using too much glucose is muscle loss. If the brain and muscles relied entirely on glucose, the body would lose 50% of its nitrogen content in 8–10 days.&lt;ref&gt;McCue, MD (2010) Starvation physiology: reviewing the different strategies animals use to survive a common challenge, Comp Biochem Physiol, 156, 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

After prolonged fasting, the body begins to degrade its own skeletal muscle. To keep the brain functioning, gluconeogenesis continues to generate glucose, but glucogenic amino acids—primarily alanine—are required. These come from the skeletal muscle. Late in starvation, when blood ketone levels reach 5-7 mM, ketone use in the brain rises, while ketone use in muscles drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cahill GF | year = 1970 | title = Starvation in man | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 282 | issue = 12| pages = 668–675 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197003192821209 | pmid = 4915800 | last2 = Parris | first2 = Edith E. | last3 = Cahill | first3 = George F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autophagy]] then occurs at an accelerated rate. In autophagy, cells cannibalize critical molecules to produce amino acids for [[gluconeogenesis]]. This process distorts the structure of the cells, and a common cause of death in starvation is due to [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] failure from prolonged autophagy.&lt;ref name="yorimitsu"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yorimitsu T, Klionsky DJ | title=Autophagy: molecular machinery for self-eating| journal=Cell Death and Differentiation  | year=2005| volume=12| url=http://www.nature.com/cdd/journal/v12/n2s/full/4401765a.html| pages=1542–1552| doi=10.1038/sj.cdd.4401765 | pmid=16247502 | pmc=1828868 | issue=Suppl 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilkie Clark''' (March 8, 1920 &amp;ndash; July 29, 1989) was an African-American [[entrepreneur]] and [[civil rights]] activist.  He lived in [[Roanoke, Alabama]].  At age 69, he died of [[smoke inhalation]] when his house burned down during the early morning hours of Friday, July 29, 1989.

Clark is the subject of a self-published biography, written by his only offspring, Charlotte A. Clark-Frieson, entitled ''Chief Cook &amp; Bottle-Washer: The Unconquerable Soul of Wilkie Clark.''
[[File:Wilkie clark.jpg|thumb|Wilkie Clark]]
In this biography, Clark-Frieson posthumously claims for her father the historical remembrance and distinction that she believes he rightfully deserves as an Alabama Champion for Civil and Human Rights.  Thus, she writes him into history, through her book. As a result of the publication of the biography, on February 19, 2005, Clark posthumously received historical distinction by resolution of the Randolph County Commission, The Roanoke City Council, and the Mayor of the City of Five Points, Alabama.

Clark's biography tells the story of a dirt-poor boy who grew up under the oppressive conditions of [[Jim Crow]] in the South, and emerged from raw racial oppression to become a self-made, and self-taught entrepreneur.  As a young man, he accepted the position of President of the County's NAACP, a challenge very few black men of that day were willing to accept, for with it came the threat of being lynched, or ambushed by vindictive whites, who at that time, felt free to do to black civil rights workers, whatever they pleased.  As NAACP president, and with limited help from other blacks Clark pressed forward, implementing every NAACP initiative he could—challenging the racial conditions of unpaved streets, inadequate school facilities, and books, desegregation, voter registration, and after desegregation, served as a staunch advocate for the children attending schools in Randolph County, Alabama.  During the 1970s he became the first black to run for a seat on the County's Board of Education, with whom he had battled for a number of years over unfair discipline at the Randolph County High School.  Aided by many other black activists who later came on the scene, Clark was instrumental in facilitating the filing of litigation creating single member voting districts, making it possible for many "firsts" to be elected to public offices in Randolph County, Alabama.  His own daughter, Charlotte A. Clark-Frieson was among those elected to public office, as a result of this litigation.

As a means of strengthening her claim of historical distinction, Clark-Frieson has founded and established a Randolph County-based grass-roots organization named for Clark, called The Wilkie Clark Memorial Foundation, Inc.  She uses her father's life and courageous community works as the philosophical pillars upon which the foundation's missions are established.  Its purposes include: black economic empowerment, historical preservation of black history throughout East Alabama and West Georgia, community education, etc.

As a means of promoting the missions of the Clark Memorial Foundation, Inc., the organization publishes a black weekly newspaper, ''The Peoples Voice''.  The Peoples Voice was inaugurated July 22, 2005, and has been in continuous publication since.  The paper is distributed throughout the nation, with it major new focus on East Alabama and West Georgia.

:''This article is about the Cuban taekwondo athlete. For the Puerto Rican politician, see [[Angel Matos García]].''
'''Ángel Valodia Matos Fuentes''' (born December 24, 1976 in [[Holguín]]) is a former [[Cuba]]n [[taekwondo]] athlete. He received a [[gold medal]] at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney]],&lt;ref name=db-ol-TKD2000&gt;[http://www.databaseolympics.com/games/gamessport.htm?g=25&amp;sp=TKD "2000 Summer Olympics&amp;nbsp; – Sydney, Australia&amp;nbsp; – Taekwondo"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823081100/http://www.databaseolympics.com/games/gamessport.htm?g=25&amp;sp=TKD |date=2008-08-23 }} ''databaseOlympics.com'' (Retrieved on April 5, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and added [[Taekwondo at the 2007 Pan American Games|another]] at the [[2007 Pan American Games]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

The [[World Taekwondo Federation]] banned Matos and his coach for life following an incident [[Taekwondo at the 2008 Summer Olympics|at the 2008 Summer Olympics]] where Matos kicked the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[referee]] [[Chakir Chelbat]] in the face, after being disqualified in the [[bronze medal]] match. The decision was later ratified by the [[IOC]].&lt;ref name = "SMH_20080825"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/taekwondo/cuban-kicked-out-after-attacking-referee/2008/08/25/1219516279008.html Cuban kicked out after taekwondo disgrace] ''Sydney Morning Herald Aug 25, 2008''&lt;/ref&gt; He was also banned for life by the same committee.

==2000 Summer Olympics==
[[Taekwondo at the 2000 Summer Olympics|At the 2000 Summer Olympics]], Matos was gold medalist in the men's middleweight (80&amp;nbsp;kg) class.&lt;ref name="time2004"&gt;Staff report (August 9, 2004).

In the quarterfinals, he defeated [[Victor Manuel Estrada Garibay]] of [[Mexico]] 2–0, besting [[Sweden|Swede]] [[Roman Livaja]] in the semifinals, 4–0. In the gold medal match Matos defeated [[Germany]]'s [[Faissal Ebnoutalib]] 3–1.&lt;ref name="espn2000"&gt;Staff report (September 29, 2000).

==2004 Summer Olympics==
Matos was the defending Olympic welterweight champion. At the [[2003 Pan American Games]], Matos was defeated 4–1 by eventual gold medalist [[Steven López]].&lt;ref name="weir2004"&gt;Weir, Tom (August 2, 2004).

==2008 Summer Olympics==
In the bronze medal match in the men's 80+ kg class at the [[Taekwondo at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]], Matos was set against Kazakhstan's [[Arman Chilmanov]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/24/olympics2008.olympicstaekwondo|title=Cuban banned after assault on referee | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=2008-08-24 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he incurred a foot injury (at which point he led the match 3-2), he took a [[Kyeshi]]&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; ("suspend", medical timeout). Under [[World Taekwondo Federation]] tournament rules, players sustaining injury are allowed one minute of Kyeshi time, at the end of which the competitor in question must return to the center of the ring to resume the fight, request further time, or forfeit the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtf.org/site/rules/competition.htm#19|title=The World Taekwondo Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sweden|Swedish]] referee [[Chakir Chelbat]] gave a time warning at 40 seconds, but Kyeshi elapsed without Matos returning to the center.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The referee ruled while he was sitting awaiting medical attention that he had taken too long during his time out and subsequently ruled he had retired.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; "To me it was obvious he was unable to continue," his opponent [[Arman Chilmanov]] of Kazakhstan said.

After the fight, Yang Jin-suk, the secretary general of the World Taekwondo Federation, apologised and said "This is an insult to the Olympic vision, an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and, in my opinion, an insult to mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/23/AR2008082301905.html|title=Cuban Taekwondo Athlete Puts Worst Foot Forward|date=2008-08-24|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hours later, the WTF banned Matos and González from WTF-sanctioned events for life; in a statement announcing its decision, the WTF called Matos' behaviour "a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the Olympic Games."  It also deleted Matos' results from the 2008 Olympics from the records.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Ian|last= Ransom|title= Cuban banned for referee kick|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Olympics/idUSPEK30514420080823|publisher= [[Reuters]]|date= 2008-08-23|accessdate=2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aSGpc2ezfJpI&amp;refer=home|title=Cuban Taekwondo champ faces ban for kicking Olympic ref in head | work=Bloomberg | date=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matos's coach Leudis González said of the referee's initial decision to end the fight, "He was too strict..." and accused the Kazakhstan team of offering bribes.&lt;ref name="AFP/Fox"/&gt; Former Cuban [[president]] [[Fidel Castro]] also defended Matos, saying he was rightfully indignant over his disqualification. "I saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two Cuban boxers [[Boxing at the 2008 Summer Olympics|in the semifinals]]," Castro wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fidel Castro defends Ángel Matos' actions |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/olympics/2008/08/25/bc.cuba.castro.olympics.ap/index.html?eref=si_latest |work=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831113340/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/olympics/2008/08/25/bc.cuba.castro.olympics.ap/index.html?eref=si_latest |archivedate=August 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
