[[File:US Navy 050308-N-2385R-029 Master-at-Arms Seaman Carly Farmer checks an identification card (ID) before allowing a driver to enter the gate at U.S. Fleet Activities Sasebo, Japan.jpg|thumbnail|A sailor checks an identification card (ID) before allowing a vehicle to enter a military institution.]]

In the fields of [[physical security]] and [[information security]], '''access control''' ('''AC''') is the selective restriction of access to a place or other [[resource]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IETF RFC|4949}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of ''accessing'' may mean consuming, entering, or using.  Permission to access a resource is called ''[[authorization]]''.

[[Lock (security device)|Locks]] and [[Login|login credentials]] are two analogous mechanisms of access control.

==Physical security==
{{Main|Physical security}}

[[File:Fob-at-proximity-reader 532 130xauto.jpg|thumb|Example of fob based access control using an ACT reader]]

Geographical access control may be enforced by personnel (e.g., [[border guard]], [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]], [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]] checker), or with a device such as a [[turnstile]]. There may be [[fence]]s to avoid circumventing this access control. An alternative of access control in the strict sense (physically controlling access itself) is a system of checking authorized presence, see e.g. [[Ticket controller (transportation)]]. A variant is exit control, e.g. of a shop (checkout) or a country.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The term access control refers to the practice of restricting entrance to a property, a building, or a room to [[authorized]] persons. Physical access control can be achieved by a human (a guard, bouncer, or receptionist), through mechanical means such as locks and keys, or through technological means such as access control systems like the [[mantrap (access control)|mantrap]]. Within these environments, physical key management may also be employed as a means of further managing and monitoring access to mechanically keyed areas or access to certain small assets.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Physical access control is a matter of who, where, and when. An access control system determines who is allowed to enter or exit, where they are allowed to exit or enter, and when they are allowed to enter or exit. Historically, this was partially accomplished through keys and locks. When a door is locked, only someone with a key can enter through the door, depending on how the lock is configured. Mechanical locks and keys do not allow restriction of the key holder to specific times or dates. Mechanical locks and keys do not provide records of the key used on any specific door, and the keys can be easily copied or transferred to an unauthorized person. When a mechanical key is lost or the key holder is no longer authorized to use the protected area, the locks must be re-keyed.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Electronic access control uses computers to solve the limitations of mechanical locks and keys. A wide range of [[credentials]] can be used to replace mechanical keys. The electronic access control system grants access based on the credential presented. When access is granted, the door is unlocked for a predetermined time and the [[Database transaction|transaction]] is recorded. When access is refused, the door remains locked and the attempted access is recorded. The system will also monitor the door and alarm if the door is forced open or held open too long after being unlocked.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Access control system operation===
When a credential is presented to a reader, the reader sends the credential’s information, usually a number, to a control panel, a highly reliable processor. The control panel compares the credential's number to an access control list, grants or denies the presented request, and sends a transaction log to a [[database]]. When access is denied based on the [[access control list]], the door remains locked. If there is a match between the credential and the access control list, the control panel operates a relay that in turn unlocks the door. The control panel also ignores a door open signal to prevent an alarm. Often the reader provides feedback, such as a flashing red [[LED]] for an access denied and a flashing green LED for an access granted.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The above description illustrates a single factor transaction. Credentials can be passed around, thus subverting the access control list. For example, Alice has access rights to the [[server room]], but Bob does not. Alice either gives Bob her credential, or Bob takes it; he now has access to the server room. To prevent this, [[two-factor authentication]] can be used. In a two factor transaction, the presented credential and a second factor are needed for access to be granted; another factor can be a PIN, a second credential, operator intervention, or a [[Biometrics|biometric input]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

There are three types (factors) of authenticating information:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/authentication_guidance.pdf |title=Authentication in an Internet Banking Environment |author=Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-12-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505203410/http://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/authentication_guidance.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* something the user knows, e.g. a password, pass-phrase or PIN
* something the user has, such as smart card or a  [[key fob]]
* something the user is, such as fingerprint, verified by biometric measurement

Passwords are a common means of verifying a user's identity before access is given to information systems.  In addition, a fourth factor of authentication is now recognized: someone you know, whereby another person who knows you can provide a human element of authentication in situations where systems have been set up to allow for such scenarios.  For example, a user may have their password, but have forgotten their smart card.  In such a scenario, if the user is known to designated cohorts, the cohorts may provide their smart card and password, in combination with the extant factor of the user in question, and thus provide two factors for the user with the missing credential, giving three factors overall to allow access.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Credential===
A credential is a physical/tangible object, a piece of knowledge, or a facet of a person's physical being that enables an individual access to a given physical facility or computer-based information system.  Typically, credentials can be something a person knows (such as a number or PIN), something they have (such as an [[access badge]]), something they are (such as a biometric feature), or some combination of these items. This is known as [[multi-factor authentication]].  The typical credential is an access card or key-fob, and newer software can also turn users' smartphones into access devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/microstrategys-office-of-the-future-includes-mobile-identity-and-cybersecurity/2013/04/13/eb82e074-a1e3-11e2-be47-b44febada3a8_story.html|title=MicroStrategy’s office of the future includes mobile identity and cybersecurity|publisher=Washington Post|date=2014-04-14|accessdate=2014-03-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216093132/http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/microstrategys-office-of-the-future-includes-mobile-identity-and-cybersecurity/2013/04/13/eb82e074-a1e3-11e2-be47-b44febada3a8_story.html|archivedate=2014-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many card technologies including magnetic stripe, bar code, [[Wiegand effect|Wiegand]], 125&amp;nbsp;kHz proximity, 26-bit card-swipe, contact smart cards, and [[contactless smart card]]s. Also available are key-fobs, which are more compact than ID cards, and attach to a key ring.  [[Biometrics|Biometric technologies]] include fingerprint, facial recognition, iris recognition, retinal scan, voice, and hand geometry.  The built-in biometric technologies found on newer smartphones can also be used as credentials in conjunction with access software running on mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/iphone-5s-biometrics-turning-point-a-6065/op-1|title=iPhone 5S: A Biometrics Turning Point?|publisher=BankInfoSecurity.com|date=2013-09-16|accessdate=2014-03-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911223315/http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/iphone-5s-biometrics-turning-point-a-6065/op-1|archivedate=2015-09-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to older more traditional card access technologies, newer technologies such as [[Near field communication]] (NFC) and [[Bluetooth low energy]] also have potential to communicate user credentials to readers for system or building access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securitysystemsnews.com/article/nfc-access-control-cool-and-coming-not-close|title=NFC access control: cool and coming, but not close|publisher=Security Systems News|date=2013-09-25|accessdate=2014-03-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406155040/http://www.securitysystemsnews.com/article/nfc-access-control-cool-and-coming-not-close|archivedate=2014-04-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wirelessdesignmag.com/blogs/2012/06/ditch-those-tacky-key-chains-easy-access-ec-key|title=Ditch Those Tacky Key Chains: Easy Access with EC Key|publisher=Wireless Design and Development|date=2012-06-11|accessdate=2014-03-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407101653/http://www.wirelessdesignmag.com/blogs/2012/06/ditch-those-tacky-key-chains-easy-access-ec-key|archivedate=2014-04-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kisi And KeyMe, Two Smart Phone Apps, Might Make House Keys Obsolete|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/house-keys-extinct_n_4339682.html|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311201754/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/house-keys-extinct_n_4339682.html|archivedate=11 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access control system components===

[[File:Locksmiths-11211.jpg|thumb|Various control system components]]
An access control point can be a [[door]], turnstile, parking gate, elevator, or other physical barrier, where granting access can be electronically controlled. Typically, the access point is a door. An electronic access control door can contain several elements. At its most basic, there is a stand-alone electric lock. The lock is unlocked by an operator with a switch. To automate this, operator intervention is replaced by a reader. The reader could be a keypad where a code is entered, it could be a [[card reader]], or it could be a biometric reader. Readers do not usually make an access decision, but send a card number to an access control panel that verifies the number against an access list. To monitor the door position a magnetic door switch can be used. In concept, the door switch is not unlike those on refrigerators or car doors. Generally only entry is controlled, and exit is uncontrolled. In cases where exit is also controlled, a second reader is used on the opposite side of the door. In cases where exit is not controlled, free exit, a device called a request-to-exit (REX) is used. Request-to-exit devices can be a push-button or a motion detector. When the button is pushed, or the motion detector detects motion at the door, the door alarm is temporarily ignored while the door is opened. Exiting a door without having to electrically unlock the door is called mechanical free egress. This is an important safety feature. In cases where the lock must be electrically unlocked on exit, the request-to-exit device also unlocks the door.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Access control topology===
[[File:Access control door wiring.png|thumb|right|Typical access control door wiring]]
[[File:Intelligent access control door wiring.PNG|thumb|right|Access control door wiring when using intelligent readers]]

Access control decisions are made by comparing the credential to an access control list. This look-up can be done by a host or server, by an access control panel, or by a reader. The development of access control systems has seen a steady push of the look-up out from a central host to the edge of the system, or the reader. The predominant topology circa 2009 is hub and spoke with a control panel as the hub, and the readers as the spokes. The look-up and control functions are by the control panel. The spokes communicate through a serial connection; usually RS-485. Some manufactures are pushing the decision making to the edge by placing a controller at the door. The controllers are [[Internet Protocol|IP]] enabled, and connect to a host and database using standard networks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.axis.com/blog/secure-insights/opening-new-doors-with-ip-access-control/|title=Opening new doors with IP access control - Secure Insights|date=2018-03-16|work=Secure Insights|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of readers===
Access control readers may be classified by the functions they are able to perform:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* Basic (non-intelligent) readers: simply read card number or PIN, and forward it to a control panel. In case of biometric identification, such readers output the ID number of a user. Typically, [[Wiegand interface|Wiegand protocol]] is used for transmitting data to the control panel, but other options such as RS-232, RS-485 and Clock/Data are not uncommon. This is the most popular type of access control readers. Examples of such readers are RF Tiny by RFLOGICS, ProxPoint by HID, and P300 by Farpointe Data.
* Semi-intelligent readers: have all inputs and outputs necessary to control door hardware (lock, door contact, exit button), but do not make any access decisions. When a user presents a card or enters a PIN, the reader sends information to the main controller, and waits for its response. If the connection to the main controller is interrupted, such readers stop working, or function in a degraded mode. Usually semi-intelligent readers are connected to a control panel via an [[EIA-485|RS-485]] bus. Examples of such readers are InfoProx Lite IPL200 by CEM Systems, and AP-510 by Apollo.
* Intelligent readers: have all inputs and outputs necessary to control door hardware; they also have memory and processing power necessary to make access decisions independently. Like semi-intelligent readers, they are connected to a control panel via an RS-485 bus. The control panel sends configuration updates, and retrieves events from the readers. Examples of such readers could be InfoProx IPO200 by CEM Systems, and AP-500 by Apollo. There is also a new generation of intelligent readers referred to as "[[IP reader]]s". Systems with IP readers usually do not have traditional control panels, and readers communicate directly to a PC that acts as a host.

Some readers may have additional features such as an LCD and function buttons for data collection purposes (i.e. clock-in/clock-out events for attendance reports), camera/speaker/microphone for intercom, and smart card read/write support.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Access control readers may also be classified by their type of [[card reader|identification technology]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Access control system topologies===
[[File:Access control topologies serial controllers.png|thumb|right|Access control system using serial controllers]]
'''1. Serial controllers.''' Controllers are connected to a host PC via a serial [[EIA-485|RS-485]] communication line (or via 20mA [[current loop]] in some older systems). External RS-232/485 converters or internal RS-485 cards have to be installed, as standard PCs do not have RS-485 communication ports.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Advantages:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* RS-485 standard allows long cable runs, up to 4000 feet (1200 m)
* Relatively short response time. The maximum number of devices on an RS-485 line is limited to 32, which means that the host can frequently request status updates from each device, and display events almost in real time.
* High reliability and security as the communication line is not shared with any other systems.
Disadvantages:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} 
* RS-485 does not allow Star-type wiring unless splitters are used
* RS-485 is not well suited for transferring large amounts of data (i.e. configuration and users). The highest possible throughput is 115.2 kbit/sec, but in most system it is downgraded to 56.2 kbit/sec, or less, to increase reliability.
* RS-485 does not allow the host PC to communicate with several controllers connected to the same port simultaneously. Therefore, in large systems, transfers of configuration, and users to controllers may take a very long time, interfering with normal operations.
* Controllers cannot initiate communication in case of an alarm. The host PC acts as a master on the RS-485 communication line, and controllers have to wait until they are polled.
* Special serial switches are required, in order to build a redundant host PC setup.
* Separate RS-485 lines have to be installed, instead of using an already existing network infrastructure.
* Cable that meets RS-485 standards is significantly more expensive than regular Category 5 UTP network cable.
* Operation of the system is highly dependent on the host PC. In the case that the host PC fails, events from controllers are not retrieved, and functions that require interaction between controllers (i.e. anti-passback) stop working.
[[File:Access control topologies main controller a.png|thumb|right|Access control system using serial main and sub-controllers]]
'''2. Serial main and sub-controllers.''' All door hardware is connected to sub-controllers (a.k.a. door controllers or door interfaces). Sub-controllers usually do not make access decisions, and instead forward all requests to the main controllers. Main controllers usually support from 16 to 32 sub-controllers.

Advantages:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* Work load on the host PC is significantly reduced, because it only needs to communicate with a few main controllers.
* The overall cost of the system is lower, as sub-controllers are usually simple and inexpensive devices.
* All other advantages listed in the first paragraph apply.
Disadvantages:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} 
* Operation of the system is highly dependent on main controllers. In case one of the main controllers fails, events from its sub-controllers are not retrieved, and functions that require interaction between sub-controllers (i.e. anti-passback) stop working.
* Some models of sub-controllers (usually lower cost) do not have the memory or processing power to make access decisions independently. If the main controller fails, sub-controllers change to degraded mode in which doors are either completely locked or unlocked, and no events are recorded. Such sub-controllers should be avoided, or used only in areas that do not require high security.
* Main controllers tend to be expensive, therefore such a topology is not very well suited for systems with multiple remote locations that have only a few doors.
* All other RS-485-related disadvantages listed in the first paragraph apply.
[[File:Access control topologies main controller b.png|thumb|right|Access control system using serial main controller and intelligent readers]]
'''3. Serial main controllers &amp; intelligent readers.''' All door hardware is connected directly to intelligent or semi-intelligent readers. Readers usually do not make access decisions, and forward all requests to the main controller. Only if the connection to the main controller is unavailable, will the readers use their internal database to make access decisions and record events. Semi-intelligent reader that have no database and cannot function without the main controller should be used only in areas that do not require high security. Main controllers usually support from 16 to 64 readers. All advantages and disadvantages are the same as the ones listed in the second paragraph. 
[[File:Access control topologies terminal servers.png|thumb|right|Access control systems using serial controllers and terminal servers]]
'''4. Serial controllers with terminal servers.''' In spite of the rapid development and increasing use of computer networks, access control manufacturers remained conservative, and did not rush to introduce network-enabled products. When pressed for solutions with network connectivity, many chose the option requiring less efforts: addition of a [[terminal server]], a device that converts serial data for transmission via LAN or WAN.

Advantages:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* Allows utilizing the existing network infrastructure for connecting separate segments of the system.
* Provides a convenient solution in cases when the installation of an RS-485 line would be difficult or impossible.
Disadvantages:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* Increases complexity of the system.
* Creates additional work for installers: usually terminal servers have to be configured independently, and not through the interface of the access control software.
* Serial communication link between the controller and the terminal server acts as a bottleneck: even though the data between the host PC and the terminal server travels at the 10/100/1000Mbit/sec network speed, it must slow down to the serial speed of 112.5 kbit/sec or less. There are also additional delays introduced in the process of conversion between serial and network data.
All the RS-485-related advantages and disadvantages also apply.
[[File:Access control topologies IP master.png|thumb|right|Access control system using network-enabled main controllers]]
'''5. Network-enabled main controllers.''' The topology is nearly the same as described in the second and third paragraphs. The same advantages and disadvantages apply, but the on-board network interface offers a couple of valuable improvements. Transmission of configuration and user data to the main controllers is faster, and may be done in parallel. This makes the system more responsive, and does not interrupt normal operations. No special hardware is required in order to achieve redundant host PC setup: in the case that the primary host PC fails, the secondary host PC may start polling network controllers. The disadvantages introduced by terminal servers (listed in the fourth paragraph) are also eliminated. 
[[File:Access control topologies IP controller.png|thumb|right|Access control system using IP controllers]]
'''6. [[IP access controller|IP controllers]].''' Controllers are connected to a host PC via Ethernet LAN or WAN.

Advantages:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* An existing network infrastructure is fully utilized, and there is no need to install new communication lines.
* There are no limitations regarding the number of controllers (as the 32 per line in cases of RS-485).
* Special RS-485 installation, termination, grounding and troubleshooting knowledge is not required.
* Communication with the controllers may be done at the full network speed, which is important if transferring a lot of data (databases with thousands of users, possibly including biometric records).
* In case of an alarm, controllers may initiate connection to the host PC. This ability is important in large systems, because it serves to reduce network traffic caused by unnecessary polling.
* Simplifies installation of systems consisting of multiple sites that are separated by large distances. A basic Internet link is sufficient to establish connections to the remote locations.
* Wide selection of standard network equipment is available to provide connectivity in various situations (fiber, wireless, VPN, dual path, PoE)
Disadvantages:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} 
* The system becomes susceptible to network related problems, such as delays in case of heavy traffic and network equipment failures.
* Access controllers and workstations may become accessible to hackers if the network of the organization is not well protected. This threat may be eliminated by physically separating the access control network from the network of the organization. Also it should be noted that most IP controllers utilize either Linux platform or proprietary operating systems, which makes them more difficult to hack. Industry standard data encryption is also used.
* Maximum distance from a hub or a switch to the controller (if using a copper cable) is 100 meters (330&amp;nbsp;ft).
* Operation of the system is dependent on the host PC. In case the host PC fails, events from controllers are not retrieved and functions that require interaction between controllers (i.e. anti-passback) stop working. Some controllers, however, have a peer-to-peer communication option in order to reduce dependency on the host PC.
[[File:Access control topologies IP reader.png|thumb|right|Access control system using IP readers]]
'''7. [[IP reader]]s.''' Readers are connected to a host PC via Ethernet LAN or WAN.

Advantages:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* Most IP readers are PoE capable. This feature makes it very easy to provide battery backed power to the entire system, including the locks and various types of detectors (if used).
* IP readers eliminate the need for controller enclosures.
* There is no wasted capacity when using IP readers (e.g. a 4-door controller would have 25% of unused capacity if it was controlling only 3 doors).
* IP reader systems scale easily: there is no need to install new main or sub-controllers.
* Failure of one IP reader does not affect any other readers in the system.

Disadvantages:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* In order to be used in high-security areas, IP readers require special input/output modules to eliminate the possibility of intrusion by accessing lock and/or exit button wiring. Not all IP reader manufacturers have such modules available.
* Being more sophisticated than basic readers, IP readers are also more expensive and sensitive, therefore they should not be installed outdoors in areas with harsh weather conditions, or high probability of vandalism, unless specifically designed for exterior installation. A few manufacturers make such models.
The advantages and disadvantages of IP controllers apply to the IP readers as well.

===Security risks===
[[File:Access control door wiring io module.png|thumb|right|Access control door wiring when using intelligent readers and IO module]]

The most common security risk of intrusion through an access control system is by simply following a legitimate user through a door, and this is referred to as [[Piggybacking (security)|tailgating]]. Often the legitimate user will hold the door for the intruder. This risk can be minimized through security awareness training of the user population, or more active means such as turnstiles. In very high security applications this risk is minimized by using a [[sally port]], sometimes called a security vestibule or mantrap, where operator intervention is required presumably to assure valid identification.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The second most common risk is from levering a door open. This is relatively difficult on properly secured doors with strikes or high holding force magnetic locks. Fully implemented access control systems include forced door monitoring alarms. These vary in effectiveness, usually failing from high false positive alarms, poor database configuration, or lack of active intrusion monitoring.  Most newer access control systems incorporate some type of door prop alarm to inform system administrators of a door left open longer than a specified length of time. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The third most common security risk is natural disasters.  In order to mitigate risk from natural disasters, the structure of the building, down to the quality of the network and computer equipment vital.  From an organizational perspective, the leadership will need to adopt and implement an All Hazards Plan, or Incident Response Plan.  The highlights of any incident plan determined by the [[National Incident Management System (US)|National Incident Management System]] must include Pre-incident planning, during incident actions, disaster recovery, and after action review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nimsonline.com/nims_3_04/incident_command_system.htm |title=Incident Command System :: NIMS Online :: Serving the National Incident Management System (NIMS) Community. |date=2007-03-18 |access-date=2016-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318154341/http://www.nimsonline.com/nims_3_04/incident_command_system.htm |archivedate=March 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to levering is crashing through cheap partition walls. In shared tenant spaces the divisional wall is a vulnerability.  A vulnerability along the same lines is the breaking of sidelights.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Spoofing locking hardware is fairly simple and more elegant than levering.  A strong magnet can operate the solenoid controlling bolts in electric locking hardware.  Motor locks, more prevalent in Europe than in the US, are also susceptible to this attack using a doughnut shaped magnet. It is also possible to manipulate the power to the lock either by removing or adding current, although most Access Control systems incorporate battery back-up systems and the locks are almost always located on the secure side of the door. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Access cards themselves have proven vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. Enterprising hackers have built portable readers that capture the card number from a user’s proximity card. The hacker simply walks by the user, reads the card, and then presents the number to a reader securing the door. This is possible because card numbers are sent in the clear, no encryption being used. To counter this, dual authentication methods, such as a card plus a PIN should always be used.

Many access control credentials unique serial numbers are programmed in sequential order during manufacturing.  Known as a sequential attack, if an intruder has a credential once used in the system they can simply increment or decrement the serial number until they find a credential that is currently authorized in the system. Ordering credentials with random unique serial numbers is recommended to counter this threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clonemykey.com/blog/smart-access-control-polices-for-residential-commercial-buildings/|title=Smart access control polices for residential &amp; commercial buildings|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704011005/https://www.clonemykey.com/blog/smart-access-control-polices-for-residential-commercial-buildings/|archivedate=4 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, most electric locking hardware still have mechanical keys as a fail-over. Mechanical key locks are vulnerable to [[Lock bumping|bumping]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

====The need-to-know principle====
{{further|Principle of least privilege}}
The need to know principle can be enforced with user access controls and authorization procedures and its objective is to ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to information or systems necessary to undertake their duties.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Computer security ==
{{Further|Computer access control}}

In [[computer security]], general access control includes [[authentication]], [[authorization]], and [[audit trail|audit]]. A more narrow definition of access control would cover only access approval, whereby the system makes a decision to grant or reject an access request from an already authenticated subject, based on what the subject is authorized to access. Authentication and access control are often combined into a single operation, so that access is approved based on successful authentication, or based on an anonymous access token. Authentication methods and tokens include [[password]]s, biometric scans, physical [[Lock (security device)|keys]], electronic keys and devices, hidden paths, social barriers, and monitoring by humans and automated systems.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In any access-control model, the entities that can perform actions on the system are called ''subjects'', and the entities representing resources to which access may need to be controlled are called ''objects'' (see also [[Access Control Matrix]]). Subjects and objects should both be considered as software entities, rather than as human users: any human users can only have an effect on the system via the software entities that they control.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Although some systems equate subjects with ''user&amp;nbsp;IDs'', so that all processes started by a user by default have the same authority, this level of control is not fine-grained enough to satisfy the [[principle of least privilege]], and arguably is responsible for the prevalence of [[malware]] in such systems (see [[computer insecurity]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In some models, for example the [[object-capability model]], any software entity can potentially act as both subject and object.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

{{As of | 2014}}, access-control models tend to fall into one of two classes: those based on [[capability-based security|capabilities]] and those based on [[access control lists]] (ACLs).
* In a capability-based model, holding an [[:wikt:unforgeable|unforgeable]] reference or ''capability'' to an object provides access to the object (roughly analogous to how possession of one's house key grants one access to one's house); access is conveyed to another party by transmitting such a capability over a secure channel
* In an ACL-based model, a subject's access to an object depends on whether its identity appears on a list associated with the object (roughly analogous to how a bouncer at a private party would check an ID to see if a name appears on the guest list); access is conveyed by editing the list.  (Different ACL systems have a variety of different conventions regarding who or what is responsible for editing the list and how it is edited.){{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Both capability-based and ACL-based models have mechanisms to allow access rights to be granted to all members of a ''group'' of subjects (often the group is itself modeled as a subject).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Access control systems provide the essential services of ''authorization'', ''identification and authentication'' (''I&amp;A''),  ''access approval'', and ''accountability'' where:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

* authorization specifies what a subject can do
* identification and authentication ensure that only legitimate subjects can log on to a system
* access approval grants access during operations, by association of users with the resources that they are allowed to access, based on the authorization policy
* accountability identifies what a subject (or all subjects associated with a user) did

==Telecommunication==
In [[telecommunication]], the term ''access control'' is defined in U.S. [[Federal Standard 1037C]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/other/a.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508200727/http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/other/a.pdf |archivedate=2007-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the following meanings: 
#  A [[service feature]] or technique used to permit or deny use of the components of a communication [[system]].
#  A technique used to define or restrict the rights of individuals or application programs to obtain [[data]] from, or place data onto, a [[data storage device|storage device]].
#  The definition or restriction of the rights of individuals or application programs to obtain data from, or place data into, a [[Data storage device|storage device]].
#  The process of limiting access to the resources of an [[Automated information system|AIS]] (Automated Information System) to authorized users, programs, processes, or other systems.
#  That function performed by the resource controller that allocates system resources to satisfy [[User (telecommunications)|user]] requests.

This definition depends on several other technical terms from Federal Standard 1037C.

==In object-oriented programming==

In [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented programming languages]], ''access control'' is a part of the apparatus of achieving [[Encapsulation (computer programming)|encapsulation]], one of four fundamentals of object-oriented programming. The goal is to establish a clear separation between interface (visible and accessible parts of the class) and implementation (internal representation and helper methods).

Also known as [[Information hiding|data hiding]], it ensures exclusive data access to class members (both variables and methods) and protects object integrity by preventing corruption by a client programmer/ client classes. Rule of thumb is to use the more restrictive access level for your data, unless there is a compelling reason to expose it.  This also helps to reduce interdependencies between classes - leading to lower [[coupling]] and fewer regression bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/14738/data-hiding|title=What is Data Hiding? - Definition from|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912055705/https://www.techopedia.com/definition/14738/data-hiding|archivedate=12 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In object-oriented programming, ''access control'' is typically implemented using [[access modifiers]] in the object or class. Although access modifiers may be syntactically different between languages, they all attempt to achieve the same goal; Define which variables and methods are visible and to whom.

Several programming languages (e.g. Java, C++, C#, Ruby) use the same '''public''', '''protected''' and '''private''' access modifiers. These are the keywords which allow a programmer to establish access levels to classes and class members (both data and methods). Their exact use in each programming language is varied, depending on the language philosophy, but there are more similarities than differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html|title=Controlling Access to Members of a Class (The Java™ Tutorials &gt; Learning the Java Language &gt; Classes and Objects)|website=docs.oracle.com|accessdate=11 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930134755/https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html|archivedate=30 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: in Ruby, '''private''' methods always have '''self''' as an implicit receiver. Therefore, they can only be used on their current object.

In some languages there are mechanisms to override access modifies to gain access to the private components of an object. One such example is the friend class in C++.

===Attribute accessors===

Special public member methods - '''accessors''' (aka '''getters''') and [[Mutator method|'''mutator methods''']] (often called '''setters''') are used to control changes to class variables in order to prevent unauthorized access and data corruption.

== Public policy==

In [[Policy|public policy]], access control to restrict access to systems ("[[authorization]]") or to track or monitor behavior within systems ("[[accountability]]") is an implementation feature of using [[trusted systems]] for [[security]] or [[social control]].

[[File:Башмачникова Ольга Владимировна АПР (2012).JPG|thumb|120px|Olga Bashmachnikova – the leader of the party in 2012]]	
The '''Agrarian Party of Russia''' (''Agrarnaya Partiya Rossii'', Аграрная Партия России, АПР) is an [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[political party]] in [[Russia]]. Founded in February 1993, it was among the earliest parties in the [[History of Russia (1992–present)|Russian Federation]].

==History==

The Agrarian Party of Russia was founded on February 26, 1993, by the head of the [[Altai Republic]], [[Mikhail Lapshin]] and [[Vasily Starodubtsev]], governor of the [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] region and former member of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s [[State Committee on the State of Emergency]]. During their leadership (1993-2004), the party made an alliance with the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] (CPRF) and the [[Fatherland – All Russia]] bloc. Until 2008, the ideology of the party was [[agrarian socialism]] and [[collectivism]].

Founder Mikhail Lapshin led the party until 2004; its most recent leader was [[Vladimir Plotnikov]]. In the State [[Duma]] election of December 1993, the Agrarian Party obtained 37 seats in the Duma and won 8% of the popular vote. Between 1994 and 1996, one of its party members, [[Ivan Rybkin]], was the speaker of the Russian Parliament. In the State Duma elections in December 1995, the APR did not make it over the 5% threshold, obtaining only 3.78% of the votes. In the last [[legislative]] elections on December 7, 2003, the party won 3.6% of the popular vote and three out of 450 seats in the parliament.

Agrarian Party member [[Nikolay Kharitonov]] ran as a presidential candidate from the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] in the 2004 Russian Presidential election and won 13.7% of the votes, coming out second to [[Vladimir Putin]].
 
In the 1990s, party deputies were usually allies of the Communist Party in the State Duma and advocated greater government support for the [[agricultural sector]].

The party won 2.30% of the votes in the 2007 elections, did not break the 7% barrier, and thus, had no seats in the [[Duma]].

The Agrarian Party supported the candidacy of [[Dmitry Medvedev]] in the 2008 presidential election. It later merged with [[United Russia]] – a party that currently holds the most seats in the Duma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/13/content_9959631.htm Russia's Agrarian Party to merge with United Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery===
The year 2012 marked an especially notable period for the party as it was officially restored, and the registered leader Olga Bashmachnikova was elected Executive Director of the Agricultural Association on May 18. This led the party to take a new direction, moving away from the ideologies of agrarian socialism and collectivism towards centrism. The party has abandoned the Alliance with the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] (CPRF), which was in the union since its foundation. Agrarian party of Russia is currently united with [[People's Front for Russia]] and [[Russian Ecological Party "The Greens"]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://minjust.ru/taxonomy/term/191 The program and Charter of the Agrarian Party of Russia on the website of the Ministry of Justice of Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the results of the elections of 2012, 2013 and 2014, the party failed to win in regional and city parliaments.

The stated objective of the BSS movement, and the aim of the slogan, was to initiate a debate in order to stop [[immigration]] by non-[[Europe]]ans and [[repatriation|repatriate]] non-ethnic Swedes. Inspiration came from the post-WW2 fascist organisation [[Nysvenska Rörelsen]] created by [[Per Engdahl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/det-fordjupar-bilden-av-kamprads-engagemang_6412096.svd SvD: ”Fördjupar bilden av Kamprads engagemang”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded as a loosely organised network in 1979&lt;ref name="Widfeldt2015"/&gt; by [[Leif Zeilon]], and formalised as an organisation in 1983, BSS was involved with the [[Populism|populist]] [[Progress Party (Sweden)|Progress Party]] ({{lang-sv|Framstegspartiet}}) in 1986. This co-operation took place under the name [[Sweden Party]] ({{lang-sv|Sverigepartiet}}). This cooperation evolved into the [[Sweden Democrats]] ({{lang-sv|Sverigedemokraterna}}) (SD) in 1988.&lt;ref name="Stieg"&gt;[[Stieg Larsson]] &amp; Mikael Ekman: ''Sverigedemokraterna - Den nationella rörelsen'' {{ISBN|91-7324-877-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claiming not to be racists, their often aggressive sticker campaigns arguably indicated otherwise with [[slogan]]s such as "Låt inte din dotter bli en negerleksak" (Don't let your daughter become a [[negro]] toy) and "Negrer hotar sina offer" (Negros threaten their victims).&lt;ref name="Lodenius"/&gt;

Although the number of members was comparatively small, BSS represented the first organised attempt to reduce immigration and as a result received massive media attention.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The slogan "Keep Sweden Swedish" was taken on by the Sweden Democrats and became prevalent during 2003-2004, when it was used for headlines in the party newspaper "SD Kuriren" and as a slogan on bumper stickers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The face of one of Severus and Julia's sons has been erased; it may be Geta's, as a result of the ''damnatio memoriae'' ordered by his brother Caracalla after Geta's death.]]

'''''Damnatio memoriae''''' is a modern [[Latin language|Latin phrase]] meaning "condemnation of memory", i.e., that a person is to be excluded from official accounts. There are and have been many routes to ''damnatio'', including the destruction of depictions, the removal of names from inscriptions and documents, and even large-scale rewritings of history.

It was a form of dishonor that could be passed by the [[Roman Senate]] on [[treason|traitors]] or others who brought discredit to the [[Roman State]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} The term can be applied to other instances of official scrubbing; the practice is seen as long ago as the reign of the Egyptian pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]] in the fourteenth century BC.

== Etymology ==
In Latin, the term ''damnatio memoriae'' was not used by the ancient Romans. The first appearance of the phrase is in a [[dissertation]] written in Germany in 1689. The term is used in modern scholarship to cover a wide array of official and unofficial sanctions whereby the physical remnants of a deceased individual were destroyed to differing degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Monumenta Graeca et Romana: Mutilation and transformation : damnatio memoriae and Roman imperial portraiture|author=Eric R. Varner|publisher=BRILL|year=2004|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Roman Sculpture|author1=Elise A. Friedland|author2=Melanie Grunow Sobocinski|author3=Elaine K. Gazda|publisher=Oxford|page=669}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Römermuseum Osterburken (DerHexer) 2012-09-30 008.jpg|thumb|''Damnatio memoriae'' of '[[Commodus]]' on an inscription in the Museum of Roman History [[Osterburken]]. The abbreviation "CO" was later restored with paint.]]

== Practice ==
''Damnatio memoriae'', or oblivion, as a punishment was originally created by the peoples of [[Ephesus]] after [[Herostratus]] set fire to the [[Temple of Artemis]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of antiquity]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Romans, who viewed it as a punishment worse than death, adopted this practice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Felons would literally be erased from history for the crimes they had committed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The sense of the expression ''damnatio memoriae'' and of the sanction is to cancel every trace of the person from the life of Rome, as if they had never existed, in order to preserve the honour of the city.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} In a city that stressed [[social status|social appearance]], respectability, and the pride of being a true Roman as a fundamental requirement of the citizen, it was perhaps the most severe punishment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}[[File:Sejanus Damnatio Memoriae.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Sejanus|Lucius Aelius Sejanus]] suffered ''damnatio memoriae'' following a failed conspiracy to overthrow emperor [[Tiberius]] in A.D. 31. His statues were destroyed and his name obliterated from all [[public records]]. The above coin from [[Augusta Bilbilis]], originally struck to mark the consulship of Sejanus, has the words ''L. Aelio Seiano'' obliterated.]]

In ancient Rome, the practice of ''damnatio memoriae'' was the condemnation of Roman elites and [[List of Roman Emperors|emperors]] after their deaths. If the senate or a later emperor did not like the acts of an individual, they could have his property seized, his name erased and his statues reworked. Because there is an economic incentive to seize property and rework statues, historians and archaeologists have had difficulty determining when official ''damnatio memoriae'' actually took place, although it seems to have been quite rare.

It is unknown whether any ''damnatio memoriae'' was totally successful as it would not be noticeable to later historians, since, by definition, it would entail the complete and total erasure of the individual in question from the historical record. It was difficult, however, to implement the practice completely. For instance, the senate wanted to condemn the memory of [[Caligula]], but [[Claudius]] prevented this. [[Nero]] was declared an enemy of the state by the senate, but then given an enormous funeral honoring him after his death by [[Vitellius]]. While statues of some emperors were destroyed or reworked after their death, others were erected. Also, historians often wrote about the deposed emperors.  Finally, many coins with the images of the discredited person continued to circulate. A particularly large number exist with [[Geta (emperor)|Geta]]'s image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dougsmith.ancients.info/geta.html Geta: The One Who Died] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203213839/http://dougsmith.ancients.info/geta.html |date=December 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice was applied to [[Elagabalus]] after his assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Willer Laale, ''Ephesus (Ephesos): An Abbreviated History From Androclus to Constantine XI'' (2011) p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at cases of ''damnatio memoriae'' in modern Irish history, [[Guy Beiner]] has argued that iconoclastic vandalism entails subtle expressions of ambiguous remembrance and that, rather than effacing memory, such acts of ''decommemorating'' effectively preserve memory in obscure forms.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Beiner, [https://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/3846.htm ''Remembering the Year of the French: Irish Folk History and Social Memory'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2007)], p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Guy Beiner, [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/forgetful-remembrance-9780198749356? ''Forgetful Remembrance: Social Forgetting and Vernacular Historiography of a Rebellion in Ulster'' (Oxford University Press, 2018)], pp. 369-384.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Orchard''' (born June 28, 1950) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] author and political figure, member of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], who was the Liberal Party candidate for the Saskatchewan riding of [[Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal election]].

Previously, Orchard was a member of the now defunct [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] (PC Party), and opposed the party's merger with the [[Canadian Alliance]] to form the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]. Orchard has never held political office in Canada, but has been involved in [[leadership conventions]] and other political activities. He is perhaps best known for his campaign to oppose the [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]]. Orchard has become a prominent activist against the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement arguing it would weaken Canada's sovereignty and control of its resources. He also campaigned against the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), the proposed [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] and the proposed [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI).

Orchard is a fourth-generation [[organic farming|organic]] [[cereal|grain]] farmer, and also the author of the bestselling book ''[[The Fight for Canada|The Fight for Canada: Four Centuries of Resistance to American Expansionism]]''.  He was also a co-founder of CCAFT (Citizens Concerned About Free Trade) in 1985.

==Early life==
Orchard was born in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]. Educated in Borden, Orchard went on to study arts and science and then law at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in nearby Saskatoon, although he did not graduate. He later studied [[French language|French]] at [[Quebec City]]'s [[Université Laval]].  Orchard is the fourth-generation on his family farm on which he has farmed organically for over 30 years.

==Positions==
Orchard sees himself as a "[[Red Tory|Red]]" or moderate [[Tory]] and claims to be ideologically inspired by his political idols former [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime ministers]] [[John Diefenbaker]], [[Richard B. Bennett, 1st Viscount Bennett|Lord Richard Bennett]], Sir [[Robert Borden]] and Sir [[John A. Macdonald]].  He is passionately opposed to Canadian economic integration with the U.S., including the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he says impedes Canada's economic and cultural sovereignty.  He has criticized many aspects of the [[United States]] foreign policy including wars and invasions of small nations.

Orchard supports government social programs, and is a strong supporter of the environment.  Orchard is a devoted [[monarchist]], and opposes a weakening of federal powers in favour of the provinces. He also supported the campaign against the [[Meech Lake Accord|Meech Lake]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]]s, calling them "The mortal weakening of the central government". He also advocates that 3 to 5% of the [[Gross Domestic Product]] go to military spending. He is opposed to [[gun control]]. He is a social conservative, and (according to the ''[[National Post]]'') opposes [[same-sex marriage]], a charge he has denied.&lt;ref name=natpost20060817a&gt;{{cite web|last=Ivison |first=John |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=34cedb6d-8685-47b1-b285-17542fa6d5d9&amp;k=52726 |title=Orchard boosts Dion's farm team |work=National Post |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=2015-12-10 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orchard describes his own views as being [[Conservatism|conservative]] in the "historical mainstream" and "centrist" of the PC party, and claimed they would appeal to moderate Canadians. Orchard's beliefs are perhaps best likened to that of the traditional, British Tory, which although historically common in Canada, lost much of their relevance since the rise of the so-called [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]] faction. He has been shunned by many conservatives, who often accuse him of being out of step with modern conservatism and too far to the left. Such claims were common during his bids for PC leader, when he was accused being an opportunist who tried to practise [[entryism]], and take over the Progressive Conservative Party and steer it sharply to the left and away from the conservatism of [[Brian Mulroney]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].

He has never been elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] or to any public office. As a Progressive Conservative, he sought election in the federal [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Prince Albert (electoral district)|Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 federal election]]. He placed a distant fourth, although with the highest percentage vote received by a Progressive Conservative candidate in Saskatchewan since 1993. He lost in the 2008 Canadian federal election, placing second in the Saskatchewan riding of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, as the Liberal candidate.

==1998 Progressive Conservative leadership campaign==
Orchard ran twice for the [[Progressive Conservative leadership elections|PC leadership]]: in [[Progressive Conservative leadership election, 1998|1998]] and in [[Progressive Conservative leadership election, 2003|2003]]. In his first attempt, he finished a distant second to [[Joe Clark]] on the final ballot but attracted a very different group of supporters to the Tory party in doing so.  Many of Orchard's supporters were former members of the other political parties in Canada and two of Orchard's most prominent endorsers in the leadership bid were the leaders of the Green parties of [[Green Party of British Columbia|British Columbia]] and [[Green Party of Ontario|Ontario]].  During the relatively quiet race, Clark referred to Orchard as a "tourist" in the Tory party because of his left-leaning economic platform and opposition to the free trade agreements brokered by the [[Brian Mulroney|Mulroney]] government. In one debate, opponent [[Brian Pallister]] quipped that "Mr. Orchard is so left-wing, he thinks [[Svend Robinson]] is a right-wing maniac."

However, Orchard did gain respect from PC circles when he chose to stick with the Tories after Clark's victory.  Orchard and his political advisor [[Marjaleena Repo]] worked hard after his failed leadership bid to rebuild several Saskatchewan PC constituency associations and improve PC membership sales across Canada.  Orchard was one of Clark's staunchest defenders during the lead-up to the August 2002 convention that saw Clark resign as Tory leader after the disintegration of the parliamentary PC-[[Democratic Representative Caucus]] coalition in May 2002.

==2003 Progressive Conservative leadership campaign==
Respect for Orchard grew in the Red Tory wing of the PC Party: roughly one-quarter of the party membership supported him during the 2003 PC leadership campaign, including Joe Clark's wife, [[Maureen McTeer]].&lt;ref name=PGIB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pgib.ca/2cards/pages/english/content/history/PCRace.htm|title=2003 Progressive Conservative Leadership Race|publisher=[[Progressive Group for Independent Business]]|accessdate=2015-12-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210233300/http://www.pgib.ca/2cards/pages/english/content/history/PCRace.htm|archive-date=2015-12-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Orchard ultimately came in third on the third ballot in the 2003 PC convention, behind Nova Scotia [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[Peter MacKay]] and Calgary lawyer [[Jim Prentice]]. Orchard decided to support Peter MacKay over Jim Prentice due to the latter's implicit support for a [[United Alternative]] (merger of the party with the [[Canadian Alliance]] (CA) party).  However, Orchard's support, which helped Peter MacKay win the leadership, came at price.  MacKay signed a written deal, or "gentleman's agreement" to seal support from Orchard's largely loyal delegates on the final ballot.

===The MacKay-Orchard deal===
The deal promised a review of the [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]], no joint candidates with the Canadian Alliance, and a promise to redouble efforts to rebuild the national status of the Progressive Conservative Party. The agreement also included reexamining the PC Party's policies on government subsidies for national railways and preserving the environment. This agreement was controversial, and some time passed before it was released to the public.  Many in the PC Party approved of the deal, including leadership candidate [[Scott Brison]].

At first MacKay had seemed to be willing to adhere to the deal.  In July, MacKay struck up a "Blue Ribbon PC Policy Review Panel", chaired by Tory MP [[Bill Casey]], in order to reexamine the party's policies on NAFTA.

However, before the Panel could meet, MacKay  encouraged talks between high-profile members of the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives. In October 2003, the talks culminated in MacKay and [[Stephen Harper]], leader of the Canadian Alliance, signing an agreement in principle to merge the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance to form the new [[Conservative Party of Canada]].

==Anti-merger activist==
Orchard unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the merger. In a high-profile news conference in early November he suggested that the new Conservative Party of Canada was "an abomination, conceived in deception, born in betrayal."  He urged PC Party members to vote "no" on any referendum and also encouraged "loyal members" to express their frustrations with Peter MacKay.  Orchard argued that his efforts were not based on self-promotion but rather on preserving Canada's founding party and preventing a takeover of the moderate values and membership of the PCs by the [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]] values of the Alliance membership.

Orchard opposed the right wing, and in his view slavishly pro-U.S. views of the Canadian Alliance. Orchard argued that before the merger was announced, the Canadian Alliance and its leader, Stephen Harper, were highly unpopular and a moment was fast approaching for the PCs to reemerge as the national alternative to the governing Liberals.  Orchard suggested that MacKay's "traitorous" actions put the above scenario in jeopardy.  Some other notable Tories such as Joe Clark, [[Flora MacDonald (politician)|Flora MacDonald]], [[Brian Peckford]] and [[Sinclair Stevens]] also opposed the merger.

In a last-ditch attempt to stop the merger, Orchard went to court, seeking an [[injunction]] against the merger vote.  The case was thrown out of court on the grounds that a merger through a "national convention" did not violate the PC Party constitution.  The merger was ratified with 96% support by members of the Canadian Alliance in a one-member-one-vote process on December 5. The PC Party opted for a "virtual convention" in which delegates were selected in ridings and then attended local provincial urban centres in which they voted for or against the merger.

Orchard described the process as fraudulent and undemocratic, as the convention delegates never actually voted together in any fixed location.  The convention produced a result in which 90.5% of the Progressive Conservative Party delegates voted in favour of the merger. However, Orchard and other opponents claimed the result was not representative of the true PC membership, pointing out that new memberships in the party were sold almost up to the day of the vote, many of which were card holders of the larger Canadian Alliance and the PC members were being swamped.

==A lost battle==
Many analysts have suggested that Orchard's battle to preserve the PC Party may have been vigorous but ultimately pointless.  By the time the agreement in principle was formalized in October, the fate of the PC Party may have been practically sealed.  Orchard himself had commented as early as September that the party's preparations for a widely expected [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]] were in disarray.  Since becoming leader, MacKay and the party's ruling council had done little to facilitate election readiness and preparation which may have been an early signal of MacKay's intentions to not run a full slate of 308 PC candidates in the expected election.

Orchard also faced speculation from some opponents and journalists in regard to his motivations to preserve the Progressive Conservative political name brand.  Some critics suggested that he was really attempting to undermine Peter MacKay's merger stance in order to force a resignation and prompt another leadership race, allowing for a "takeover" by Orchard and his supporters.

==Aftermath==
At first, Orchard refused to join or work with the new party. In February 2004, he was asked to take over the leadership of the struggling [[Canadian Action Party]] after the resignation of its leader, [[Paul Hellyer]], but Orchard declined. There were also rumours that Orchard was in discussions over a future Saskatchewan rural riding candidacy for the [[Saskatchewan Party]], and Orchard's name was frequently touted as a possible future leadership contender for the [[Green Party of Canada]].

Shortly before the Conservative Party's March 2005 policy convention, Orchard had his membership revoked by the party and was denied access to the event.  "The council decided that it was in the interests of the party that they didn't want him to be a member of the party any longer," said Ian Brodie, the executive director of the Conservative Party.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

On January 31, 2006, a Toronto judge ordered the Conservative Party of Canada to pay Orchard $70,000, the funds from his 2003 leadership campaign which he had been owed since then.  The CPC had previously insisted on Orchard's signing a pledge not to sue Peter MacKay over issues resulting from the agreement signed at the 2003 PC Leadership Convention in order to settle the affair, which Orchard refused to do.&lt;ref name=cbc20050131a&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sask/story/orchard060131.html |title=Judge awards Orchard $70,000 |publisher=CBC News |date=January 31, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203033640/http://www.cbc.ca/sask/story/orchard060131.html |archivedate=February 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orchard continues to write for major newspapers, present lectures in Canada's universities on foreign policy and environmental issues, and continues working in the organic farming business.

On November 19, 2005, [[CBC Radio|CBC Radio News]] reported that the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] were trying to recruit Orchard as a candidate in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]]. According to the report, Orchard would be a Liberal candidate in either [[Saskatchewan]] or rural [[Ontario]].  Orchard did not run as a Liberal in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] but he announced his support for the Liberals and campaigned for [[Chris Axworthy]] in Saskatchewan,&lt;ref name=Starphoenix20060111a&gt;{{cite web|last=French|first=Janet|url=http://www.davidorchard.com/online/media-2006/starphoenix-20060111.html|title=Orchard offers support to Grits|work=The StarPhoenix|location=Saskatoon|date=January 11, 2006|accessdate=2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yves Picard]] and [[Isa Gros-Louis]] in Quebec City, and [[Susan Whelan]] in Ontario. Orchard also officially became a member of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] during the 2006 election.

After the Liberals were defeated, and leader [[Paul Martin]] stepped down, there was some media speculation that Orchard would seek the [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 2006|Liberal Party leadership]].&lt;ref name=G&amp;M20060328&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ex-tory-orchard-mulls-bid-for-liberal-leadership/article691095/|title=Ex-Tory Orchard mulls bid for Liberal leadership|work=Globe and Mail|date=March 28, 2006|accessdate=2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, on August 17, 2006 Orchard endorsed [[Stéphane Dion]] to be the next leader of the federal Liberal Party.&lt;ref name=G&amp;M20060817&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Campbell|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mackays-kingmaker-backs-dion/article967621/|title=MacKay's kingmaker backs Dion|work=The Globe and Mail|date=August 17, 2006|accessdate=2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2006 leadership convention, Orchard led a group of approximately 150 delegates, including 32 from Saskatchewan, in support of Dion. Those delegates ended up being pivotal in helping Dion pass [[Gerard Kennedy]] for third place on the first convention ballot, and eventually win the leadership when Kennedy swung his own support behind Dion after the second ballot.

Subsequently, Orchard declared that he would be seeking the nomination in the Saskatchewan riding of [[Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River]] as a Liberal candidate in the forthcoming by-election in that riding.  Again, however, Orchard's ambitions created political controversy. Orchard's nomination fight was ultimately terminated on January 3, 2008 when Dion announced via a news release that [[Joan Beatty]] would be appointed as the candidate for that riding, a decision that was the subject of some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5i6LTn4LxZExIZB_xoWhoo4dFDuFQ|title=Former Sask.

[[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] leader [[Jim Durocher]], an Orchard supporter, wrote a letter to Dion complaining about his decision to appoint a candidate rather than allow for party members to vote in a nomination meeting. He argued that "the people of this riding resent, and I personally resent mightily, the attitude of certain southerners that they know what's best for our riding."
Durocher, a former Liberal candidate, also told Dion "If you impose Joan Beatty, the Liberals will lose this riding."&lt;ref name=orchard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brantfordexpositor.ca/2008/01/05/rift-opens-in-liberal-party-over-appointment-in-byelection-dion-chooses-ndp-defector-to-run-in-northern-sask-riding|title=Rift opens in Liberal party over appointment in byelection|work=Brantford Expositor|date=January 5, 2008|accessdate=2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National Liberal campaign co-chair [[David Smith (Canadian Senator)|David Smith]], however, defended Beatty's appointment by saying that Dion had made getting more women into politics a priority, saying that the party is "prepared to bite the bullet to demonstrate that our commitment to increasing our number of women candidates - particularly well-qualified ones - is very real."&lt;ref name=orchard /&gt; The media also reported that Liberal party [[House Leader]] and Saskatchewan MP [[Ralph Goodale]], a former [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|finance minister]], was opposed to Orchard's candidacy in the by-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Delacourt|first=Susan|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2008/01/05/dion_accused_of_snubbing_orchard.html|title=Dion accused of snubbing Orchard|work=Toronto Star|date=January 5, 2008|accessdate=2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beatty lost [[Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River by-election, 2008|the ensuing byelection]] to Conservative candidate [[Rob Clarke]]. On August 14, it was reported that Orchard would challenge Beatty for the Liberal nomination in Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River for the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 federal election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yaffe |first=Barbara |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/editorial/story.html?id=2271ee09-bc7d-42fb-90a6-9106b441ea5d |title=David Orchard is back to make life hard for Dion &amp; Co. |work=Vancouver Sun |date=August 14, 2008 |accessdate=2015-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215002142/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/editorial/story.html?id=2271ee09-bc7d-42fb-90a6-9106b441ea5d |archivedate=2015-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/beatty-orchard-square-off-for-liberal-nomination-1.772692|title=Beatty, Orchard square off for Liberal nomination|publisher=CBC News|date=August 14, 2008|accessdate=2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orchard won the nomination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=82068fe2-cb6d-4451-a5fc-3f4435146c0d |title=David Orchard wins Saskatchewan Liberal nomination |work=The StarPhoenix |location=Saskatoon |date=August 15, 2008 |accessdate=2015-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215002141/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=82068fe2-cb6d-4451-a5fc-3f4435146c0d |archivedate=2015-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/orchard-wins-liberal-nomination-in-northern-sask-1.708919|title=Orchard wins Liberal nomination in northern Sask.|publisher=CBC News|date=August 15, 2008|accessdate=2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but placed second in the election, losing to Clarke by 3,148 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/conservatives-repeat-strong-showing-in-saskatchewan-1.740819|title=Conservatives repeat strong showing in Saskatchewan|publisher=CBC News|date=October 14, 2008|accessdate=2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidorchard.com/online/media-2008/meadowlakeprogress-20081019.html|title=Orchard proud of election race|work=Meadow Lake Progress|date=October 19, 2008|accessdate=2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11501">The '''debt service coverage ratio''' ('''DSCR'''), also known as "debt coverage ratio" (DCR), is the ratio of cash available for debt servicing to interest, principal and lease payments. It is a popular [[Benchmarking|benchmark]] used in the measurement of an entity's (person or corporation) ability to produce enough cash to cover its debt (including lease) payments. The higher this ratio is, the easier it is to obtain a loan. The phrase is also used in commercial banking and may be expressed as a minimum ratio that is acceptable to a lender; it may be a loan condition.  Breaching a DSCR covenant can, in some circumstances, be an act of [[Default (finance)|default]].

==Uses==
In corporate finance, DSCR refers to the amount of cash flow available to meet annual interest and principal payments on debt, including sinking fund payments.&lt;ref name="freedictionary"&gt;[http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Debt-Service+Coverage+Ratio+-+DSCR DSCR finance term by the Free Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

In personal finance, DSCR refers to a ratio used by bank loan officers in determining debt servicing ability.

In commercial real estate finance, DSCR is the primary measure to determine if a property will be able to sustain its debt based on cash flow.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s banks typically required a DSCR of at least 1.2,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} but more aggressive banks would accept lower ratios, a risky practice that contributed to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]].  A DSCR over 1 means that (in theory, as calculated to bank standards and assumptions) the entity generates sufficient cash flow to pay its debt obligations. A DSCR below 1.0 indicates that there is not enough cash flow to cover loan payments. In certain industries where non-recourse project finance is used, a Debt Service Reserve Account is commonly used to ensure that loan repayment can be met even in periods with DSCR&lt;1.0 &lt;ref name="Corality Financial Modelling"&gt;[http://www.corality.com/tutorials/dscr-debt-service-coverage-ratio Corality Debt Service Coverage Ratio Tutorial]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation==
In general, it is calculated by:
:&lt;math&gt; \text{DSCR} = \text{Net Operating Income} / \text{Debt Service} &lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Net Operating Income} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Depreciation} + \text{Interest Expense} + \text{Other Non-cash Items} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Debt Service} = \text{Principal Repayment} + \text{Interest Payments} + \text{Lease Payments} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="freedictionary" /&gt;

To calculate an entity’s debt coverage ratio, you first need to determine the entity’s [[net operating income]]. To do this you must take the entity’s total income and deduct any vacancy amounts and all operating expenses. Then take the net operating income and divide it by the property’s annual debt service, which is the total amount of all interest and principal paid on all of the property’s loans throughout the year.

If a property has a debt coverage ratio of less than one, the income that property generates is not enough to cover the mortgage payments and the property’s [[operating expense]]s. A property with a debt coverage ratio of .8 only generates enough income to pay for 80 percent of the yearly debt payments. However, if a property has a debt coverage ratio of more than 1, the property does generate enough revenue to cover annual debt payments. For example, a property with a debt coverage ratio of 1.5 generates enough income to pay all of the annual debt expenses, all of the operating expenses and actually generates fifty percent more income than is required to pay these bills.

A DSCR of less than 1 would mean a negative cash flow. A DSCR of less than 1, say .95,  would mean that there is only enough net operating income to cover 95% of annual debt payments. For example, in the context of personal finance, this would mean that the borrower would have to delve into his or her personal funds every month to keep the project afloat. Generally, lenders frown on a negative cash flow, but some allow it if the borrower has strong outside income.&lt;ref name=freedictionary /&gt;&lt;ref name="investopedia"&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dscr.asp Debt-Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) on Investopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, most commercial banks require the ratio of 1.15–1.35 times (net operating income or NOI / annual debt service) to ensure cash flow sufficient to cover loan payments is available on an ongoing basis.

===Example===
Let’s say Mr. Jones is looking at an investment property with a net operating income of $36,000 and an annual debt service of $30,000. The debt coverage ratio for this property would be 1.2 and Mr. Jones would know the property generates 20 percent more than is required to pay the annual mortgage payment.

The Debt Service Ratio is also typically used to evaluate the quality
of a portfolio of mortgages.  For example, on June 19, 2008, a popular
US rating agency, Standard &amp; Poors, reported that it lowered its credit
rating on several classes of pooled commercial mortgage pass-through
certificates originally issued by Bank of America.  The rating agency
stated in a press release that it had lowered the credit ratings of
four certificates in the Bank of America Commercial Mortgage Inc.
2005-1 series, stating that the downgrades "reflect the credit
deterioration of the pool".  They further go on to state that this
downgrade resulted from the fact that eight specific loans in the
pool have a debt service coverage (DSC) below 1.0x, or below one
times.

The Debt Service Ratio, or debt service coverage, provides a useful
indicator of financial strength.  Standard &amp; Poors reported that
the total pool consisted, as of June 10, 2008, of 135 loans, with
an aggregate trust balance of $2.052 billion.  They indicate that
there were, as of that date, eight loans with a DSC of lower than
1.0x.  This means that the net funds coming in from rental of the
commercial properties are not covering the mortgage costs.  Now,
since no one would make a loan like this initially, a financial
analyst or informed investor will seek information on what the
rate of deterioration of the DSC has been.  You want to know not
just what the DSC is at a particular point in time, but also how
much it has changed from when the loan was last evaluated.  The
S&amp;P press release tells us this.  It indicates that of the eight
loans which are "underwater", they have an average balance of $10.1
million, and an average decline in DSC of 38% since the loans
were issued.

And there is still more.  Since there are a total of 135 loans in
the pool, and only eight of them are underwater, with a DSC of
less than 1, the obvious question is: what is the total DSC of the
entire pool of 135 loans?  The Standard and Poors press release
provides this number, indicating that the weighted average DSC
for the entire pool is 1.76x, or 1.76 times.  Again, this is just
a snapshot now.  The key question that DSC can help you answer,
is this better or worse, from when all the loans in the pool were
first made?   The S&amp;P press release provides this also, explaining
that the original weighted average DSC for the entire pool of 135
loans was 1.66x, or 1.66 times.

In this way, the DSC (debt service coverage) ratio provides a way to assess the financial quality, and the associated risk level, of this pool of loans, and shows the surprising result that despite some loans experiencing DSC below 1, the overall DSC of the entire pool has improved, from 1.66 times to 1.76 times.  This is pretty much what
a good loan portfolio should look like, with DSC improving over
time, as the loans are paid down, and a small percentage, in this
case 6%, experiencing DSC ratios below one times, suggesting that
for these loans, there may be trouble ahead.

And of course, just because the DSCR is less than 1 for some loans,
this does not necessarily mean they will default.

===Pre-Tax Provision Method=== 

Income taxes present a special problem to DSCR calculation and interpretation. While, in concept, DSCR is the ratio of cash flow available for debt service to required debt service, in practice &amp;ndash; because interest is a tax-deductible expense and principal is not &amp;ndash; there is no one figure that represents an amount of cash generated from operations that is both ''fully available'' for debt service and ''the only cash available'' for debt service.

While [[Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization | Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization]] (EBITDA) is an appropriate measure of a company's ability to make interest-only payments (assuming that expected change in working capital is zero), EBIDA (without the "T") is a more appropriate indicator of a company's ability to make required principal payments. Ignoring these distinctions can lead to DSCR values that overstate or understate a company's debt service capacity. The Pre-Tax Provision Method provides a single ratio that expresses overall debt service capacity reliably given these challenges.

Debt Service Coverage Ratio as calculated using the Pre-Tax Provision Method answers the following question: How many times greater was the company's EBITDA than its critical EBITDA value, where critical EBITDA is that which just covers its Interest obligations + Principal obligations + Tax Expense ''assuming minimum sufficient income'' + Other necessary expenditures not treated as accounting expenses, like dividends and CAPEX.

The DSCR calculation under the Pre-Tax Provision Method is '''EBITDA''' / ('''Interest''' + '''Pre-tax Provision for Post-Tax Outlays'''), where '''Pre-tax Provision for Post-tax Outlays''' is the amount of pretax cash that must be set aside to meet required post-tax outlays, i.e., CPLTD + Unfinanced CAPEX + Dividends. The provision can be calculated as follows:

''If'' noncash expenses (depreciation + depletion + amortization) &gt; post-tax outlays, ''then''
Pretax provision for post-tax outlays = Post-tax outlays

For example, if a company’s post-tax outlays consist of CPLTD of $90M and $10M in unfinanced CAPEX, and its noncash expenses are $100M,
then the company can apply $100M of cash inflow from operations to post-tax outlays without paying taxes on that $100M cash inflow. In this case, the pretax cash that the borrower must set aside for post-tax outlays would simply be $100M.

''If'' post-tax outlays &gt; noncash expenses, ''then''
Pretax provision for post-tax outlays = Noncash expenses + (post-tax outlays - noncash expenses) / (1- income tax rate)

For example, if post-tax outlays consist of CPLTD of $100M and noncash expenses are $50M, then the borrower can apply $50M of cash inflow
from operations directly against $50M of post-tax outlays without paying taxes on that $50M inflow, but the company must set aside $77M
(assuming a 35% income tax rate) to meet the remaining $50M of post-tax outlays. This company’s pretax provision for post-tax outlays = $50M + $77M = $127M. &lt;ref&gt;[http://ebiz.rmahq.org/eBusPPRO/OnlineStore/ProductDetail/tabid/55/Productid/56403794/Default.aspx Andrukonis, David (May, 2013).

'''Deputy mayor''' is an elective or appointive office of the second-ranking official in many local governments.

==Duties and functions==
Many elected vice-mayors are members of the [[city council]] who are given the title and serve as [[acting mayor]] in the mayor's absence. Appointive deputy mayors serve at the pleasure of the [[mayor]] and may function as [[chief operating officer]]s. 

There may be within the same municipal government one or more deputy mayors appointed to oversee policy areas together with a popularly-elected '''vice mayor''' who serves as the mayor's successor in the event the office is vacated by death, resignation, disability, or [[impeachment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-deputy-mayor-do.htm |title=What does a Deputy Mayor do? (with picture) |website=Wisegeek.com |date=2016-12-29 |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cities the vice mayor presides over the city council, and may not vote except to break ties. Like the deputy mayor in other systems, the popularly elected vice mayor becomes acting mayor in the mayor's absence. As previously noted, in some few cities, this office is elected separately and does not entail the elevation by the council of one of its members to be [[speaker (politics)|speaker]]. In some U.S. cities, the mayor and deputy or vice mayor run together as a ticket similar to how the [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] run at the national level.

===New York City, USA===
In [[New York City]], there are multiple deputy mayors who handle coordination of specific policy areas where the [[Deputy Mayor of New York City|First Deputy Mayor]] serves as the general deputy mayor for the [[Mayor of New York City]].

===St. Louis, Missouri, USA===
In [[St. Louis, Missouri]], there are multiple deputy mayors who handle coordination of specific policy areas where the deputy Mayors serves as the general deputy's  mayors for the [[Mayor of St. Louis]].

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], according to the [[Local Authorities (Election and Term of Mayor and Deputy Mayors) Act, 5735-1975]], a [[Mayor]] is usually elected in "personal, general, direct, equal and secret elections", with election by a local council being made only if no candidate runs for mayor, a candidate for mayor in a single-candidate election is rejected (in Israel, unlike in the UK, if only one candidate runs he is not automatically elected, and voters would vote either for that candidate or against him), or both candidates advancing to the runoff received an equal number of votes and the tie remains unbroken after adding the number of first-round votes cast for them with the number of second-round votes cast for them. However, deputy mayors are '''always''' elected by the local council, of which one is (or, in certain local authorities two are) the Designated Acting Mayor, elected after nomination by the Mayor.

===France===
The [[French language|French]] term ''député-maire'' does not mean "deputy mayor", but refers to a mayor who is also a deputy of the [[National Assembly of France]]. As of 31 March 2017, a mayor cannot hold both posts (article LO 141-1 of the electoral code).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-elections-en-France/Le-cumul-des-mandats-electoraux&lt;/ref&gt; The term for deputy mayor in french is ''Maire adjoint''.

===Davao City, Philippines===
In [[Davao City]], there is both an elected vice-mayor as a direct constitutionally mandated deputy of the [[Mayor of Davao City]] and appointed deputy mayors. The deputy mayors are appointed to administer each ethnic minorities situated in Davao City.

'''Edgar Fitzgerald Gordon''' (20 March 1895 – 20 April 1955), born in [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago]], was a physician, parliamentarian, civil-rights activist&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Jones, [http://www.moed.bm/Documents/Teachers%20Resource.pdf ''Bermuda: Five Centuries'', Chapter 18: Growing Pains], Ministry of Education, Bermuda, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and labour leader in [[Bermuda]], and is regarded as the "father of trade unionism" there:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpsu.bm/our-history "Our history"], website of Bermuda Public Services Union – BPSU.&lt;/ref&gt; "he championed the cause of Bermudian workers and fought for equal rights for black Bermudians, thereby laying the groundwork for much of the political and social change that came about after his death".&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs&gt;Meredith Ebbin, [http://www.bermudabiographies.bm/Biographies/Biography-DrGordon.html "Dr. Edgar Fitzgerald Gordon, March 20,1895 – April 20, 1955 – Physician, parliamentarian and labour leader"], Bermuda Biographies.&lt;/ref&gt; He was president of the [[Bermuda Industrial Union]] (BIU) 1945–55.&lt;ref name=BIU&gt;[http://www.biu.bm/#!about/cjg9 Bermuda Industrial Union website.]&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon has been described as "perhaps the only black charismatic leader to have emerged in the island's modern political history",&lt;ref&gt;Frances Henry (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CGvwGIVkIAQC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=%22+dr+e.f.+gordon%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d24Fgia9pz&amp;sig=SxLVCqlVpq6rJOtNQ9MMoOlaOWY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y0ofVM-cAcLvaPzegMAF&amp;ved=0CKYBEOgBMB0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20dr%20e.f.%20gordon%22&amp;f=false ''Ethnicity in the Americas''], Walter de Gruyter, 1976, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and as "Bermuda's most dedicated Pan-Africanist".&lt;ref&gt;Ira Philip, [http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20150905/ISLAND/150909819&amp;template=mobileart "The unforgettable day I met the Queen"], ''The Royal Gazette'', 7 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Gordon was honoured as a National Hero of Bermuda.&lt;ref name=Hero /&gt; Other posthumous honours he has been accorded include the Peace &amp; Social Justice Award 2016 from the Roman Catholic Church of Bermuda.&lt;ref name=PSJA&gt;[http://bernews.com/2016/10/peace-social-justice-award-dr-e-f-gordon/ "Peace &amp; Social Justice Award: Dr. E. F. Gordon"], ''Bernews'', 24 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and education==

Edgar Fitzgerald Gordon was born to Olympia Jardin and Frederick Charles Gordon in [[Port of Spain, Trinidad]], where he received his early education at [[Queen's Royal College]] (QRC),&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Martin (professor)|Tony Martin]], ''The Progress of the African Race Since Emancipation and Prospects for the Future'', The Majority Press, 1998, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; graduating as one of the school's most brilliant scholars.&lt;ref name=Philip2015&gt;Ira Philip, [http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20150321/ISLAND/150329948 "Remembering Mazumbo, a dynamic freedom fighter"], ''The Royal Gazette'', 21 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 he went to [[Scotland]] to study medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. There he met and married a fellow medical student, Clara Christian (who had previously studied music in the US at [[Hampton Institute]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]], and [[Oberlin College]], [[Ohio]]).&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20110616/ISLAND11/706149914/-1 "Dr EF Gordon – fought tirelessly for equal rights for black Bermudians"], ''The Royal Gazette'', 16 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; To the displeasure of her father George James Christian, a Dominican barrister who had settled in the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedominican.net/articles/christian.htm "George James Christian: Pioneer in Africa"], TheDominican.net, Volume No. 1, Issue No. 32, 27 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; she abandoned her medical studies to begin a family with Gordon.&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whodoyouthinkyouaremagazine.com/episode/moira-stuart "Moira Stuart", ''Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical career==

Qualifying as a doctor at the age of 23 in 1918, Gordon was for some time a medical practitioner in the small Scottish town of [[Kingussie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/whodoyouthinkyouare/past-stories/moira-stuart.shtml "Moira Stuart", ''Who Do You Think You Are?'', BBC.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 he returned to the Caribbean with his wife and young family. He briefly worked in Trinidad, then went on to become chief medical supervisor in [[Dominica]].&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt;

===Move to Bermuda===
In 1924, Gordon went to Bermuda, where he would set up a busy medical practice on Heathcote Hill in [[Somerset, Bermuda|Somerset]].&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt; According to biographer Ira Philip, Gordon "was brought to Bermuda by [[Sandys Parish|Sandys]] businessman William Robinson to fill a void caused by the death of black Dr Arnold Packwood. The all white local medical board was embarrassed when Dr Gordon passed what he termed was an impossible examination which he contended was calculated to fail him."&lt;ref&gt;Ira Philip, [http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20130309/ISLAND09/703099993 "Dr Olivia Tucker — pioneering pharmacist denied the opportunity to work in her homeland"], ''The Royal Gazette'', 8 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon began to take up the cause of black nurses and the discrimination they faced in employment in Bermuda, writing a series of letters dating from 1929 to the editor of ''[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]'' criticising the refusal of the Bermuda Welfare Society to hire Blacks as district nurses.&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernews Profile" /&gt; After decades of lobbying, the first black district nurse to be hired was Leonie Harford in 1963.&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt;

==Political life==

After standing unsuccessfully for Parliament in 1933 and 1943,&lt;ref&gt;Eva N. Hodgson, ''Second Class Citizens; First Class Men'', 2nd edition, Bermuda: The Writers Machine, 1988, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon won a seat in [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's]] in 1946.

===Name change===
On 22 June 1947,&lt;ref name=100Facts&gt;''Mazumbo: 100 Facts and Quotes by Dr. E. F. Gordon'', Writers' Machine, 1994, pp. 14, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; in protest at the fact that his fellow parliamentarians persistently refused to address him by his correct title, and that a Bermuda newspaper, the ''[[Mid-Ocean News]]'', prefixed "Mr." to the names of white members of Bermuda's Parliament (second oldest in the world), but called him simply Gordon,&lt;ref name=100Facts /&gt; he announced that henceforth he was to be known by the African name of '''Mazumbo''', with no prefix.&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt; His notice to this effect in ''The Royal Gazette'' read:
:"I, Edgar Fitzgerald Gordon, Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery of Edinburgh University, President General of the Bermuda Industrial Union, President of the Progressive Bermuda League and Member of Parliament for St. George's, hereby declare that from henceforth I shall be known as Mazumbo."
He gave as explanation: "The name Gordon, which I inherited, reminds me very painfully that some Scotsman in some other age compelled a grandmother of mine to submit to his desires. In Bermuda I am black and treated as Bermuda treats the black people.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson (1988, pp. 70–71) writes: "The daily paper often underscored its contempt for coloured people by refusing to attach a title to them in any reference to them.... [Dr. Gordon's] gesture had the value of drawing the insult to the attention of many Negroes, who, from long familiarity, tended to take so many insults for granted. It was part of Dr. Gordon's overall programme of stimulating awareness on the part of the people who were so hard pressed that they had little time to think about the basis of their problems. He understood, very well, that support was gained for these political battles through starkly presented ideas, and the simple statement of the injustices which the people faced in their daily lives."&lt;/ref&gt; So I want to be called by a name that belongs to my race and requires no prefix." He was further quoted as saying that he had taken his new name from "a famous West African chieftain, who had once been received by [[Queen Victoria]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779223,00.html "BERMUDA: Grandpa Was a Scotsman", 21 July 1947]; cited in ''Time magazine'', 21 December 2011 (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; This was a reference to a 19th-century Trinidadian lawyer called [[Emmanuel Mzumbo Lazare|Emmanuel Lazare]], popularly known as Mazumbo (or Mzumbo) Lazare, about whom Maureen Warner-Lewis has written: "although born in the Antilles, Lazare appropriated, or condoned the use of, an overtly African designation. The name was a symbol of his identification with black people and the poor. He was a defender of their rights, joined the [[Pan-African]] Association founded in 1901 in England by fellow Trinidadian [[Henry Sylvester Williams]], and became a moving spirit behind democratic political reforms at the turn of the twentieth century." This characterisation of Mazumbo Lazare is additional evidence for Gordon's motivation in associating himself with the name.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Warner-Lewis, ''Central Africa in the Caribbean: Transcending time, Transforming Cultures''. Kingston, Jamaica: University of the West Indies Press, 2003; p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality in Parliament===
As a Member of the Colonial Parliament (MCP), Gordon was a fiery and sometimes controversial orator. After the death in July 1948 of the Speaker of the House of Assembly Sir [[Reginald Conyers]] (who in his will left money for the Port Royal School in [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], providing it was "used for the education of white children"), Gordon told a public meeting that he had only attended Conyers' funeral to "make sure he was put in the hole".&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt; According to Hodgson, Gordon's "dramatic personality, his drive, and his unabashed theatricals had done what no one else either could do, or chose to do. He had alerted the Negro masses, he had given expression to their unvoiced despair and anger, often his words had given shape and form to emotions which they themselves could hardly define."&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson (1988), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bermuda Workers' Association (BWA)===
Championing the rights of black and working-class Bermudians, Gordon was asked to become president of the Bermuda Workers' Association (BWA) in 1944, which fought for trade union rights and was committed to the removal of segregation and the adoption of universal adult suffrage. Membership of the BWA had by then dwindled to 200 but under Gordon's vigorous leadership it increased to 5,000 in 1945.&lt;ref name=Zuill&gt;W. S. Zuill, ''The Story of Bermuda and Her People'' (1973), Macmillan Caribbean, 2nd revised edition 1983, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, he began his campaign to petition for social and constitutional change, and in that year the Legislature passed Bermuda's first Trade Union and Disputes Act,&lt;ref name=Zuill /&gt; which was designed to curb the fledgling BWA, making it illegal for a union to have a newspaper or operate a business.&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt; Gordon took the lead in the subsequent establishment that year of the [[Bermuda Industrial Union]] (BIU),&lt;ref name="Robert J 2004, pp. 101-02"&gt;Robert J. Alexander with Eldon M. Parker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fCmTbz1XdMwC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=edgar+fitzgerald+gordon+bermuda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zKXnuyJ0vW&amp;sig=eYGBI6eOaSGYDvQ2hGdK-ZULo0E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwDGoVChMI98HqwMnSxgIV0ArbCh2YJA8r#v=onepage&amp;q=edgar%20fitzgerald%20gordon%20bermuda&amp;f=false ''A History of Organized Labor in the English-Speaking West Indies''], Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 2004, pp. 101–02.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biuhistory.bm"&gt;[http://rjones8.wix.com/biuhistory#!events-in-history "From BWA to BIU"], BIU History.&lt;/ref&gt; and the BWA for the time being continued as its political arm.&lt;ref name=BermudaBiogs /&gt;

===Petition to British Colonial Office===
During an extended visit to England from December 1946 to March 1947, Gordon presented a petition containing over 5,000 signatures&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtec.bm/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_813_0_0_43/http;/ptpublisher.gov.bm;7087/publishedcontent/publish/gov__top_level__org__house_/government/gov___history/articles/1900s.html?qid=78569854&amp;rank=9 Government of Bermuda website.]&lt;/ref&gt; to the British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] from the BWA outlining various concerns, including the limited franchise, segregation, and restricted occupational opportunities.&lt;ref name=BdaFranchise&gt;[http://www.elections.gov.bm/~electb/images/bermuda_franchise.pdf "1946 – Dr. E. F. Gordon delivers Bermuda Workers’ Association Petition to the Colonial Office in Great Britain"], The Evolution of Bermuda's Franchise, compiled by James E. Smith. Parliamentary Registry.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20150909/COMMENT01/150909742 "When the times they were a-changin’"], ''The Royal Gazette'', 9 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Only seven per cent of the population could vote, and (as Meredith Ebbin notes) there were more votes cast than actual voters because a property owner could vote in every parish where he owned land. It was a system that gave "the monied classes a distinct and definite control over the election results", Gordon said, pointing out that while the UK and its dependencies had undertaken voting reforms, Bermuda had operated under the same system since 1620.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Ebbin, [http://bermudasun.bm/Content/OPINION/Opinion/Article/To-vote-or-not-to-vote--it-was-not-always-an-option/4/135/62296 "To vote or not to vote: it was not always an option"], ''BDA Sun'', 14 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The matter was debated in the [[British Parliament]], which while condemning many of the practices highlighted in the petition refused Dr. Gordon's request for a [[Royal Commission]] to investigate social, political and economic conditions on the island. The Colonial Secretary subsequently issued a document (Command Paper 7093), sent to the Governor, Admiral Sir [[Ralph Leatham]], strongly recommending positive and progressive changes to the colony's discriminatory laws.&lt;ref name="Bernews Profile"&gt;[http://bernews.com/2011/04/national-hero-dr-e-f-gordon/ National Hero Profile: Dr. E. F. Gordon], Bernews, 29 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BdaFranchise /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.bm/Significant_Events_in_Bermuda_and_Bermuda_Parliament.aspx "Significant Events in Bermuda"], Bermuda Parliament.&lt;/ref&gt; A Joint Committee of the Bermuda Legislative Council and House of Assembly was formed to study the matter; however, its report in April 1948 recommended against changing the colony's [[Jim Crow]] laws,&lt;ref name=High /&gt; holding that "the early adoption of adult franchise would be prejudicial to the best interests of Bermuda".&lt;ref name="Bernews Profile" /&gt; (It would not be until 1959 that segregation ended, with the BIU playing a key role in the civil disobedience that brought about the change.)&lt;ref name=High&gt;Steven High, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1abFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=%22+dr+e.f.+gordon%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W31gAwyC2_&amp;sig=Xjvcw-s975H1bYNNphg7kw5WKAg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y0ofVM-cAcLvaPzegMAF&amp;ved=0CKoBEOgBMB8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20dr%20e.f.%20gordon%22&amp;f=false ''Base Colonies in the Western Hemisphere, 1940–1967''], Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1948 election Gordon lost his House of Assembly seat – a setback attributable to his preoccupation with a dock workers' dispute that year, which had limited the time he could devote to his Parliamentary duties – but he was re-elected in 1953.&lt;ref name="Bernews Profile" /&gt;

===Queen's visit to Bermuda===
In November 1953, when the newly crowned [[Queen Elizabeth II]] made Bermuda the first (24-hour) stop in her tour of [[the Commonwealth]],&lt;ref name="Bermuda Online" /&gt; Gordon learned that of more than 1,000 guests to be invited to a Government House garden party in her honour only 60 were black, and that not a single black Bermudian had been asked to attend the official state dinner.&lt;ref name="Bernews Profile" /&gt; With the intention of focusing world attention on Bermuda's racially stratified society, Gordon passed this news to the British press and [[Reuters]] reported the resultant angry protests from the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and the ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]''. In its editorial the ''Herald'' stated: "Perhaps others may benefit from this instance of gross ill manners. It is time everyone from Governors downwards grasped the facts about this British Commonwealth. Within its frontiers coloured people outnumber whites by more than eight to one. One of the moral pledges by which it is held together is that the colour bar should be utterly destroyed as speedily as possible...."&lt;ref name="Bernews Profile" /&gt; As Bernews notes: "The Queen set foot in Bermuda the day the story broke. She was photographed that same afternoon meeting a broadly smiling, tail-coated Dr. Gordon in St. George’s."&lt;ref name="Bernews Profile" /&gt;

==Cricket==
Keenly interested in cricket, Gordon believed that Bermuda would benefit by closer contact with the islands of the [[West Indies]], which were then gaining ascendancy in [[Test cricket]]. He championed the Bermudian cricketer [[Alma Hunt]], who in 1933 went to Trinidad to take part in the trial games from which would be selected the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies team]] for the Test series in England that summer. Although proving himself both on and off the field, Hunt was not eventually given a place.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Philip, ''Freedom Fighters (From Monk To Mazumbo)'', London: Akira Press, 1987, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon pointed out that Hunt's status would have been more assured had there been an official body to deal with finance and represent him, and advocated for a [[Bermuda Cricket Board]] of Control, which was eventually formed in 1938. He was instrumental in bringing about the first ever West Indian cricket tour to Bermuda in 1939, which was headed by Trinidadian [[Ben Sealey]].&lt;ref&gt;Ira Philip, in ''Freedom Fighters'' (1987), pp. 152–58, quotes a letter dated 20 October 1953 from Gordon to the ''Mid-Ocean News'', detailing Gordon's role in the sequence of events.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Dr Gordon died in Bermuda at King Edward VII Memorial Hospital, following a heart attack at the age of 60, on 20 April 1955. Two days later thousands of people turned out for his funeral service at St. Theresa's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Hamilton and burial at Calvary Cemetery, [[Devonshire Parish]].&lt;ref&gt;Ira Philip, ''Freedom Fighters'' (1987), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Philip /&gt; According to reports, "Many of Bermuda's blacks wept at his graveside.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1312">The '''EuroPharm Forum''' (European Forum of National Pharmaceutical Associations) was a network of national pharmaceutical associations in Europe, in collaboration with the [[World Health Organization]] Regional Office for Europe. It was established in 1992 as a professional forum with a strong link to the WHO.

From the beginning in 1992, the EuroPharm Forum was hosted by the WHO Regional Office for Europe. In 2006, the secretariat was relocated to [[Pharmakon—Danish College of Pharmacy Practice]] until its closure in 2015.

The Forum organised professional symposia, usually twice annually: in connection with the conduct of the General Assembly and again approximately mid-term.

'''Financial deepening''' is a term used by [[economist]]s to refer to increasing provision of [[financial services]]. It can refer both a wider choice of services and better access for different [[social class|socioeconomic groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruralfinanceandinvestment.org/node/1485|title=Deepening Rural Financial Markets: Macroeconomic, Policy and Political Dimensions - Rural Finance and Investment Learning Centre|website=Ruralfinanceandinvestment.org|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial deepening can have an effect on both individuals' and societies' economic situations.

==Features==
The following are examples of different forms of financial deepening. Provision for the [[unbanked]] and [[underbanked]] in a society.  Development of financial markets. Development of financial institutions and increasing the diversity in financial instruments.

One of the key features of financial deepening is that it accelerates economic growth through the expansion of access to those who do not have adequate finance themselves. Typically, in an underdeveloped financial system, it is the incumbents who have better access to financial services through relationship banking. Moreover, incumbents also finance their growth through internal resource generation. Thus, in an underdeveloped financial system, growth is constrained to the expansion potential of incumbents. In mature financial systems on the other hand, financial institutions develop appraisal techniques, and information gathering and sharing mechanisms, which then enable banks to even finance those activities or firms that are at the margin, thereby leading to their growth-inducing productive activities in addition to the incumbents. The assumption is that the availability of external finance to budding entrepreneurs and small firms enables new entrepreneurship, while also providing competition to incumbents and consequently encouraging entrepreneurship and productivity. However, research indicates that widely available formal finance can produce informal intermediation, an unintended form of entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arp|first=Frithjof|last2=Ardisa|first2=Alvin|last3=Ardisa|first3=Alviani|date=2017|title=Microfinance for poverty alleviation: Do transnational initiatives overlook fundamental questions of competition and intermediation?| doi = 10.18356/10695889-en|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320100413_Microfinance_for_poverty_alleviation_Do_transnational_initiatives_overlook_fundamental_questions_of_competition_and_intermediation|journal=Transnational Corporations|volume=24|issue=3|pages=103-117|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|id=UNCTAD/DIAE/IA/2017D4A8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, maintaining a sceptical approach when researching the effectiveness of initiatives is advisable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arp|first=Frithjof|date=12 January 2018|title=The 34 billion dollar question: Is microfinance the answer to poverty?|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/the-34-billion-dollar-question-is-microfinance-the-answer-to-poverty|journal=Global Agenda|publisher=World Economic Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Macroeconomics==
Financial deepening can have a [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] effect for a country. Financial deepening generally can increase the ratio of  [[money supply]] to GDP or some price index. It can have the effect of increasing [[market liquidity|liquidity]]. Having access to money can provide more opportunities for investment and growth.

A developed financial system broadens access to funds; conversely, in an underdeveloped financial system, access to funds is limited and people are constrained by the availability of their own funds and have to resort to high cost informal sources such as money lenders. Lower the availability of funds and higher their cost, fewer would be the economic activities that can be financed and hence lower the resulting economic growth.

Promoting well-managed financial deepening in low-income countries (LICs) can enhance resilience and capacity to cope with shocks, improve macroeconomic policy effectiveness, and support solid and durable inclusive growth.

Financial deepening and macro-stability has been identified as a priority area in the years ahead for the Fund, as reflected in its Financial Surveillance Strategy paper.

Managing Volatility and Supporting Low-income Country Growth Enhancing macro-economic policy effectiveness Shallow financial systems limit fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policy choices; hamper macroeconomic policy transmission; and impede opportunities for hedging or diversifying risk. This is of particular concern because LICs are vulnerable to external shocks, such as sharp swings in commodity prices and fluctuations in external financing. Limited policy space and instruments to mitigate the ensuing macroeconomic volatility often translate into large growth and welfare costs for these countries.

===Economic growth===
{{also|Economic growth}}
The association between economic growth and financial deepening has been a wide-ranging subject of experiential research. The practical evidence suggests that there is a significant positive relationship between financial development and economic growth.{{r|imf}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-007-0102-3|title=Financial Deepening and Economic Growth Linkages: A Panel Data Analysis|first1=Nicholas|last1=Apergis|first2=Ioannis|last2=Filippidis|first3=Claire|last3=Economidou|date=1 April 2007|publisher=|journal=Review of World Economics|volume=143|issue=1|pages=179–198|doi=10.1007/s10290-007-0102-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many economists support the theory that financial development spurs economic growth. Theoretically, financial development creates enabling conditions for growth through either a supply-leading (financial development spurs growth) or a demand-following (growth generates demand for financial products) channel. A large body of empirical research supports the view that development of the financial system contributes to economic growth.{{r|rajanzingales2003}} Empirical evidence consistently emphasises the nexus between finance and growth, though the issue of direction of causality is more difficult to determine. At the cross-country level, evidence indicates that various measures of financial development (including assets of the financial intermediaries, liquid liabilities of financial institutions, domestic credit to private sector, stock and bond market capitalisation) are robustly and positively related to economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;(King and Levine, 1993; Levine and Zervos, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies establish a positive relationship between financial development and growth at the industry level.{{r|rajanzingales1998}} Some supporters of the view that internal factors determine growth ([[endogenous growth theory]]) never the less assign a special role to finance.&lt;ref&gt;(Aghion and Hewitt, 1998 and 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial systems in [[Developing country|developing countries]] became inclusive in the twenty first century. However, they are still undiversified and small.&lt;ref name=imf&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/res/dfidimf/topic5.htm|title=Topic 5. Financial Deepening for Macroeconomic Stability and Sustained Growth -- Macro Research for Development: An IMF-DFID Collaboration|website=Imf.org|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal finance==
Financial deepening can play an important role in reducing risk and vulnerability for disadvantaged groups, and increasing the ability of individuals and households to access basic services like health and education. This can have direct impact on [[poverty reduction]]. 

==Limitations==
In developing countries policy and exogenous influences determine whether financial deepening achieves optimum results.{{r|imf}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Claudio_Gonzalez-Vega/publication/251735439_Deepening_Rural_Financial_Markets_Macroeconomic_Policy_and_Political_Dimensions/links/53f3babc0cf2155be3533efd.pdf|format=PDF|title=Deepening Rural Financial Markets: Macroeconomic, Policy and Political Dimensions|website=Researchgate.net|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country specific experience==
===India===
The All-India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS), 2002 raised concerns about [[financial inclusion]], it may have reduced since 1990. After  the [[green revolution]] focus has been on financing crop loans connected largely with food grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mohan|first1=Rakesh|title=Economic Growth, Financial Deepening and Financial Inclusion|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106120816/https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=310|accessdate=6 November 2017|date=2006-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reserve Bank of India]] views the provision of banking to the poor as a viable business opportunity. It notes that costs and benefit exercises need to be attempted by the banks to make financial inclusion congruent with their business models.

== Background ==
As stated by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), the largest contributor to global warming is the increase in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]] since 1750, particularly from [[Flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion|fossil fuel combustion]], [[Cement#CO2 emissions|cement production]], and [[land use]] changes such as [[Deforestation#Atmospheric|deforestation]].&lt;ref&gt;"Total radiative forcing is positive, and has led to an uptake of energy by the climate system.  The largest contribution to total radiative forcing is caused by the increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; since 1750." (p 11)  "From 1750 to 2011, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production have released 375 [345 to 405] GtC to the atmosphere, while deforestation and other land use change are estimated to have released 180 [100 to 260] GtC." (p 10), IPCC, Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis - Summary for Policymakers, Observed Changes in the Climate System, [http://www.climatechange2013.org/spm p. 10&amp;11], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The IPCC's [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] (AR5) states: {{Quote | ''Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the [[Water cycle|global water cycle]], in reductions in [[Cryosphere|snow and ice]], in [[Sea level rise|global mean sea level rise]], and in changes in some [[Extreme weather|climate extremes]]. This evidence for human influence has grown since [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|AR4]]. It is extremely likely (95–100%) that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century''. — IPCC AR5 WG1 Summary for Policymakers&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis – Summary for Policymakers, Observed Changes in the Climate System, [http://www.climatechange2013.org/spm p. 15], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1|2013}}.

While much remains to be learned, the core phenomenon, scientific questions, and hypotheses have been examined and found wanting, lacking consistent support in the face of serious scientific debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations. * * * (p21-22) Some scientific conclusions or theories have been so thoroughly examined and tested, and supported by so many independent observations and results, that their likelihood of subsequently being found to be wrong is vanishingly small.

[[William M. Gray]] said in 2006 that global warming became a political cause because of the lack of any other enemy following the end of the [[Cold War]].

Steve Connor links the terms "hoax" and "conspiracy," saying, "Reading through the technical summary of this draft (IPCC) report, it is clear that no one could go away with the impression that climate change is some conspiratorial hoax by the science establishment, as some would have us believe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article2193668.ece |title=Steve Connor: Global warming is not some conspiratorial hoax - Independent Online Edition &gt; Commentators |accessdate=2007-11-16 |work=The Independent |location=London |date=2007-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123205651/http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article2193668.ece |archive-date=2007-11-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary ''The Great Global Warming Swindle'' received criticism from several experts. [[George Monbiot]] described it as  "the same old conspiracy theory that we’ve been hearing from the denial industry for the past ten years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2007/01/30/another-species-of-denial |title=Another Species of Denial |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in response to [[James Delingpole]], Monbiot stated that his Spectator article was "the usual conspiracy theories [...]  working to suppress the truth, which presumably now includes virtually  the entire scientific community and everyone from [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] to [[Greenpeace]]  and [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] to [[Science (journal)|Science]]."&lt;ref&gt;George  Monbiot, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/jul/09/george-monbiot-ian-plimer/print  Spectator recycles climate rubbish published  by sceptic]'', 2009-07-09&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Australian meteorologists also weighed in, saying that the film made no attempt to offer a "critical deconstruction of climate science orthodoxies", but instead used various other means to suggest that climate scientists are guilty of lying or are seriously misguided.  Although the film's publicist's asserted that "global warming is 'the biggest scam of modern times'", these meteorologists concluded that the film was "not scientifically sound and presents a flawed and very misleading interpretation of the science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=D|author2=Watkins, A. |author3=Braganza, K. |author4=Coughlan, M |title="The Great Global Warming Swindle": a critique|journal=Bulletin of the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society|year=2007|volume=20|issue=3|pages=63–72|url=https://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/15044376/646064305/name/Bulletin+of+the+Australian+Meteorological+and+Oceanographic+Society+2007+Jones.pdf|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former UK [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] [[David Miliband]] presented a rebuttal of the main points of the film and stated "There will always be people with conspiracy theories trying to do down the scientific consensus, and that is part of scientific and democratic debate, but the science of climate change looks like fact to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Great Climate Change Swindle? |url = http://www.davidmiliband.defra.gov.uk/blogs/ministerial_blog/archive/2007/03/14/5960.aspx |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070320212733/http://www.davidmiliband.defra.gov.uk/blogs/ministerial_blog/archive/2007/03/14/5960.aspx |archivedate = 2007-03-20 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' fact-checked 6 persistent scientific conspiracy theories. Regarding the persistent belief in a global warming hoax they note that the Earth is continuing to warm and the rate of warming is increasing as documented in numerous scientific studies. The rise in global temperature and its rate of increase coincides with the rise of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activity. Moreover, global warming is causing Arctic sea ice to thaw at historic rates, many species of plants are blooming earlier than expected, and the migration routes of many birds, fish, mammals, and insects are changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Than|first=Ker|title=Fact Checking 6 Persistent Science Conspiracy Theories|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130404-american-conspiracy-theories-polls-debunk/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Since the late 1980s, this well-coordinated, well-funded campaign by contrarian scientists, free-market think tanks and industry has created a paralyzing fog of doubt around climate change.

==Fictional representations==

The novel ''[[State of Fear]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]], published in December 2004, describes a conspiracy by scientists and others to create public panic about global warming. The novel includes 20 pages of footnotes, described by Crichton as providing a factual basis for the non-plotline elements of the story.&lt;ref name = "Footnotes"&gt;{{cite news |title =Checking Crichton's Footnotes| publisher = Boston Globe |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2005/02/06/checking_crichtons_footnotes/ | first=Chris | last=Mooney | date=2005-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Senate speech on 4 January 2005, [[Jim Inhofe|Inhofe]]  mistakenly described Crichton as a "scientist", and said the book's fictional depiction of environmental organizations primarily "focused on raising money, principally by scaring potential contributors with bogus scientific claims and predictions of a global apocalypse" was an example of "art imitating life."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In a piece headed ''Crichton's conspiracy theory'', Harold Evans described Crichton's theory as being "in the paranoid political style identified by the renowned historian [[Richard Hofstadter]]," and went on to suggest that "if you happen to be in the market for a conspiracy theory today, there's a rather more credible one documented by the pressure group Greenpeace," namely the funding by [[ExxonMobil]] of groups opposed to the theory of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4319574.stm |title=  Crichton's conspiracy theory |accessdate=2007-11-16 |work=BBC News | date=2005-10-07|location=London | first=Harold | last=Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Habib-ur-Rehman Ludhianvi''' (3 July 1892 &amp;ndash; 2 September 1956) was one of the founders of [[Majlis-e-Ahrar-e-Islam]]. He belonged to an [[Arain (tribe)]] and was a direct lineal descendant of Shah Abdul Qadir Ludhianvi, the freedom fighter against British Colonial rule during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. 
&lt;ref name=TNI&gt;[https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/85466-an-arain-freedom-fighter An Arain freedom fighter (Habib-ur-Rehman Ludhianvi)] The News International (newspaper), Published 15 December 2007, Retrieved 6 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APNA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnaorg.com/articles/news-33/ |title=Profile of Habib-ur-Rehman Ludhianvi|website= Academy of the Punjab in North America website|author=Ishtiaq Ahmed|date=15 December 2007|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HeritageTimes&gt;[http://heritagetimes.in/habib-ur-rehman-ludhianvi/ Profile of Habib-ur-Rehman Ludhianvi] Heritage Times (newspaper), Published 17 November 2017, Retrieved 6 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianmuslimlegends.blogspot.com/2011/09/224-maulana-habib-ur-rehman-ludhianavi.html Profile of Maulana Habib-ur-Rehman Ludhianvi on indianmuslimlegends.com website] Retrieved 8 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Habib-ur-Rehman Ludhianvi was born on 3 July 1892 at [[Ludhiana]], [[British India]].&lt;ref name=HeritageTimes/&gt; He got married to the daughter of Maulana Abdul Aziz whose name was Bibi Shafatunnisa.&lt;ref name=HeritageTimes/&gt;

Habib-ur-Rehman Ludhianvi was a fiery speaker and one of the founders of [[Majlis-e-Ahrar-ul-Islam]], a nationalist movement that wanted an end to the British rule in India. It was his choice to stay back in East Punjab, India to represent thousands of Muslims still remaining there, after the partition and the [[independence of Pakistan]] on 14 August 1947. He argued, at that time, that the remaining Muslims in East Punjab should not be abandoned. Ludhiana is considered a major industrial city of [[Punjab, India]]. A large number of working Muslims from the provinces of [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]] also come there to work.&lt;ref name=TNI/&gt;

===Family history===
Habib-ur-Rehman Ludhianvi's grandfather Shah Abdul Qadir Ludhianvi led an armed rebellion  against the British [[East India Company]] during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and was among the first ones to rebel against them from the Punjab. He gathered a large fighting force that drove the British out of not only Ludhiana but also [[Panipat]]. This fighting force included Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs. He then proceeded to [[Delhi]] to support the Mughal emperor [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]]. He gave his life fighting along with thousands of others at [[Chandni Chowk]], Delhi in 1857.&lt;ref name=TNI/&gt;

== History ==
HHN emerged from the Iraqi paramilitary [[Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq|Asaib Ahl al-Haq]] (AAH) in 2013 and is led by AAH co-founder Sheikh Akram al-Kaabi. al-Kaabi claims that, after a period of militant inactivity, the Syrian civil war motivated him to form the militia. He denies it emerged from a "split" with AAH, but that he chose not to unify with them due to disagreements.&lt;ref name="monitor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/03/iraq-shiite-hezbollah-nujaba-victory-islamic-state.html|title=Iraq’s Shiite forces claim victory over IS|date=16 March 2015|publisher=|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two groups still share close affinity, often simultaneously commemorating martyrs.&lt;ref name=business&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/iran-backed-iraqi-militias-are-pouring-into-syria-2015-10?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Iran-backed Iraqi militias are pouring into Syria|date=2 October 2015|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group openly receives training, arms, and military advice from [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-nujaba-specialrep/special-report-the-iraqi-militia-helping-iran-carve-a-road-to-damascus-idUSKCN1BX11N|title=Special Report: The Iraqi Militia Helping Iran Carve A Road To Damascus|date=22 September 2017|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have released a [[nasheed]] praising Iranian [[Quds Force]] commander [[Qasem Suleimani]].&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; They follow the Iranian government's ideology of [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|Vilayat-e Faqih]], and al-Kaabi has stated that he would overthrow the Iraqi government or fight alongside the [[Yemeni people|Yemeni]] [[Houthis]] if ordered by [[Grand Ayatollah Khamenei]].&lt;ref name="longwar"/&gt;

The group was one of the first Iraqi paramilitaries to send fighters to [[Syria]], doing so since their formation in 2013. They have had an increasing role in the country after a significant boost to recruitment efforts took place in 2015.&lt;ref name="business"/&gt; They were a major participant in the [[Aleppo offensive (October–December 2015)|2015 South Aleppo offensive]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/hezbollah-and-harakat-al-nujaba-launch-a-massive-assault-in-southern-aleppo/|title=Syrian Army and Hezbollah launch massive assault in southern Aleppo|author=Leith Fadel|date=16 December 2015|work=Al-Masdar News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Northern Aleppo offensive (February 2016)|breaking of the siege]] of the Shia towns [[Nubl]] and [[Zahraa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-hezbollah-launch-preliminary-offensive-in-northern-aleppo/|title=Syrian Army, Hezbollah launch preliminary offensive in northern Aleppo|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=1 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:West Kensington Estate 2012-09-22 13.05.44.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A housing estate in [[West Kensington]], with many rows of similar terraced flats.]]
A '''housing estate''' (or sometimes ''housing complex'') is a group of homes and other buildings built together as a single development. The exact form may vary from country to country. Accordingly, a housing estate is usually built by a single contractor, with only a few styles of house or building design, so they tend to be uniform in appearance. In the [[British Isles]], the term is quite broad, and can include anything from [[high rise]] government-subsidised housing, right through to more upmarket, developer-led [[suburban]] [[tract housing]]. 

In major Asian cities such as [[Singapore]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Seoul]], an estate may range from detached houses to high density [[tower block]]s with or without commercial facilities; in Europe and America, these may take the form of town housing, or the older-style rows of [[terraced house]]s associated with the [[industrial revolution]],  detached or [[semi-detached]] [[house]]s with small plots of land around them forming gardens, and are frequently without commercial facilities.

Housing estates are the usual form of residential design used in [[new town]]s, where estates are designed as an autonomous suburb, centred on a small commercial centre. Such estates are usually designed to minimise through-traffic flows, and to provide recreational space in the form of parks and greens.

==Etymology==
The use of the term may{{or|date=January 2015}} have arisen from an area of housing being built on what had been a [[Estate (house)|country estate]] as towns and cities expanded in and after the 19th century. It was in use by 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | housing estate }}. Note the example in a 1923 book by [[Francis Longstreth Thompson]], [https://archive.org/details/siteplanninginpr00thomuoft ''Site planning in practice; an investigation of the principles of housing estate development''].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Reduction of the phrase to mere "estate" is common in the United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] (especially when preceded by the specific estate name), but not in the United States.

==Pakistan==

Given the security situation and Power shortages in the South Asia 'Gated communities' with Self power generation and modern amenities (24-hour armed security, schools, hospitals, a fire department, retail shopping, restaurants and entertainment centres ) such as [[Bahria Town]] and [[DHA Islamabad|DHA]] have been developed in all major cities Pakistan. Bahria Town is largest private housing society in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hackread.com/asias-largest-real-estate-builder-bahria-town-website-hacked-by-pakistani-hackers/ | title=Asia’s Largest Real Estate Builder Bahria Town Website | accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahria has been featured by international magazines and news agencies such as [[GlobalPost]], [[Newsweek]], [[Los Angeles Times]] and [[Emirates 24/7]], referred to as the prosperous face of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emirates247.com/property/pakistani-expats-new-realty-check-2013-12-14-1.531291 Pakistani expats’ new realty check]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/131214/happiness-some-pakistans-gated-communities Happiness for some in Pakistan's gated communities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320164339/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/131214/happiness-some-pakistans-gated-communities |date=20 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsweekpakistan.com/gateway-to-paradise/  Gateway to Paradise]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/06/world/la-fg-pakistan-gated-communities-20111007 Pakistan gated community sparks controversy]&lt;/ref&gt; Gated communities in Pakistan are targeted towards upper middle class and upper class, and are mostly immune from problems of law enforcement.

==United Kingdom and Ireland==
[[Image:BWFE from Gloucester Road.JPG|left|thumb|[[Broadwater Farm#The Broadwater Farm Estate|Broadwater Farm Estate]] in London. Civil unrest in 1985 left two dead.]]
In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, housing estates have become prevalent since [[World War II]], as a more affluent population demanded larger and more widely spaced houses coupled with the increase of car usage for which [[Terraced house|terrace]]d streets were unsuitable.

Housing estates were produced by either local corporations or by private developers. The former tended to be a means of producing [[public housing]] leading to [[monotenure]] estates full of [[council house]]s often known as "council estates". The latter can refer to higher end [[tract housing]] for the [[middle class]] and even [[upper middle class]].

In addition, the problems incurred by the early attempts at high density tower-block housing turned people away from this style of living. The resulting demand for land has seen many towns and cities increase enormously in size for only moderate increases in population. This has been largely at the expense of rural and [[greenfield land]].  Recently, there has been some effort to address this problem by banning the development of out-of-town commercial developments, and encouraging the reuse of [[brownfield land|brownfield]] or previously developed sites for residential building. Nevertheless, the demand for housing continues to rise, and in the UK at least has precipitated a significant housing crisis.

Renowned housing estates in the capital include the [[Andover Estate]] in Holloway, North London, the aforementioned Broadwater Farm estate situated in [[Tottenham]], the [[Heygate Estate]] in [[Walworth]], South East London and the [[Alton Estate]] in [[Roehampton]], South West London.

In the UK, some of the post war [[new town]]s were constructed ''en masse'' from housing estates rather than as organic growth from a population centre.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Czech Republic and Slovakia==
[[Image:Bratislava Petrzalka R01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Petržalka]] in Bratislava (Slovakia)]]
In the former [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]) during the Communist era a construction of large housing estates (Czech: ''sídliště'', Slovak: ''sídlisko'') was an important part of then urban planning. The government wanted to provide large quantities of affordable housing and to slash costs by employing uniform designs over the whole country. They also sought to foster a "collectivistic nature" in the people. Large housing estates of concrete panel buildings ([[panelák]]) now dominate the suburbs of [[Prague]], [[Bratislava]] and other towns.
The largest such suburb in the former Czechoslovakia and [[central Europe]] can be found in [[Petržalka]] (population about 130,000), a part of the Slovak capital of Bratislava.

==Hong Kong==
{{Further|Public housing in Hong Kong|Private housing estates in Hong Kong}}
Due to dense population and government control of land use, the most common form of residential housing in [[Hong Kong]] is the high-rise housing estate, which may be publicly owned, privately owned, or semi-private. Due to the [[oligopoly]] of [[real estate development|real-estate developer]]s in the territory, and the [[economies of scale]] of mass developments, there is the tendency of new private [[tower block]] developments with 10 to over 100 towers, ranging from 30-to-70-storeys high.

[[Public housing in Hong Kong|Public housing]] provides affordable homes for those on low incomes, with rents which are heavily [[subsidy|subsidised]], financed by financial activities such as rents and charges collected from car parks and shops within or near the estates. They may vary in scale, and are usually located in the remote or less accessible parts of the territory, but urban expansion has put some of them in the heart of the urban area. Although some units are destined exclusively for rental, some of the flats within each development are earmarked for sale at prices which are lower than for private developments.

A [[private housing estate]] is usually characterised by a cluster of high-rise buildings, often with a [[Shopping mall|shopping centre]] or market of its own in the case of larger developments. [[Mei Foo Sun Chuen]], built by [[Mobil]], is the earliest (1965) and largest (99 blocks) example of its kind. Since the mid-1990s, private developers have been incorporating leisure facilities which incorporate clubhouse facilities:&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite news|title = Nan Fung to build $1b flats in Tsuen Wan|publisher = The Standard|last = Chan|first = Karen|date = 30 May 1996|accessdate = 22 March 2007|url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=16667&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=19960530&amp;sear_year=1996|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217052455/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=16667&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=19960530&amp;sear_year=1996|archivedate = 17 December 2007|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely swimming pools, tennis courts, function rooms in their more up-market developments. The most recent examples would also be equipped with cinemas, dance studios, cigar-rooms.

There is currently some controversy over the "wall effect" caused by uniform high-rise developments which adversely impact air circulation.&lt;ref name="wall"&gt;{{cite news|title=`Asia's walled city' leaves - residents longing for air |publisher=The Standard |last=Yung |first=Chester |date=21 December 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2007 |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=34625&amp;sid=11441787&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20061221&amp;sear_year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217052500/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=34625&amp;sid=11441787&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20061221&amp;sear_year=2006 |archivedate=17 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In-fill developments will tend to be done by smaller developers with less capital. These will be smaller in scale, and less prone to the wall effect.

==United States==

Forms of housing estates in the United States include [[tract housing]], apartment complexes, and [[Public housing in the United States|housing projects]].

Since its inception in 1994, the '''Hungarian Civil Liberties Union''' (HCLU) ({{lang-hu|Társaság a Szabadságjogokért}}, and its acronym ''TASZ'') is a leading [[non-governmental organization]] in the field of [[human rights]] and harm reduction advocacy in [[Hungary]].
Patterned on the successful model of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]'s work in the United States, HCLU provides legal aid and advocacy for vulnerable populations, such as drug users, psychiatric patients, and people living with HIV/AIDS, as well as providing public information on related issues.&lt;ref name="CCSI"&gt;

== Programmes ==

'''Patients’ Rights Programme'''
The Patients’ Rights Programme deals with patients’ rights guaranteed by the Act on Health Care and with other general patients’ rights issues. This program pays special attention to issues related to people’s right to make informed decisions about themselves, such as reproductive freedoms (abortion, contraception, artificial insemination, surrogacy, oocyte donation, home birth, etc.), the right to refuse treatment, euthanasia, and the rights of the intellectually disabled.

'''HIV/AIDS Programme'''
The HIV/AIDS Programme deals with the legal aspects of the issue, the Hungarian and EU strategies, and the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS. We regularly monitor the treatment and care provided to HIV patiens and the HIV testing practices in Hungary, and publish reports and studies on the subject. The HCLU’S HIV/AIDS Programme and its supervisor are members of a number of HIV/AIDS-related international organizations.

[https://tasz.hu/en/freedom-of-speech '''Freedom of Expression Programme''']
The program aims to protect the right of assembly, the freedom of speech, and the freedom of the press. Currently HCLU is the only organization providing free legal counsel and representation for journalists.

[https://tasz.hu/en/freedom-of-information '''Freedom of Information Programme''']
HCLU is the most active advocate of the freedom of information among civil organizations in Hungary. Its trials contribute to the case law practiced by judges and courts. 
 
[https://tasz.hu/en/data-protection '''Data Protection Programme''']
The goal of the Data Protection Programme is to allow the state and the business sector to handle data on citizens only if it is indispensable for their efficient operation, and to guarantee that people can decide what information they share about themselves.

[https://tasz.hu/en/taxonomy/term/840 '''Drug Policy Programme''']
The program provides legal counsel for doctors, social workers and professionals dedicated to needle exchange programmes. The program also monitors all media coverage on the topic. 
 
[https://tasz.hu/en/roma-program '''Roma Rights Advocacy''']
Institutional discrimination, primarily in the field of the criminal and administrative justice system is in the focus of the Roma Program. The Program's aim is to have a positive impact on the law enforcement and administrative authorities as well as on the judiciary. In addition, it is HCLU’s objective to have a positive effect on the legislation: to reverse the process of criminalization of poverty and thereby that of the Roma people. The Program also strives to take a stand against prejudice and discrimination by shaping opinion through various communication activities.

'''HCLU Film'''
The HCLU has launched its video advocacy programme called HCLU Film in 2007. It has produced more than 500 films since, mostly in the field of drug policy, but we are making more and more films in other fields of HCLU's work.

'''Programme furthering civil society''' 
The programme intends to form strategic partnerships enabling HCLU to share its experiences with other (local and regional) civil organizations.

[https://tasz.hu/en/disability-rights '''Disability rights programme'''] 
The disability rights programme focuses on assisting mentally challenged and severely handicapped people. The aim of the program is to help them to live their life as an equal citizen and as a recognized member of their community. The most important goal is to eliminate totalitarian mass institutions and, in parallel, to develop programs in the community that promote integration; to reform the guardian system, that is, to advocate supported decision-making; to fight legislation that attempts to restrict the voting rights and to promote the right to education for children with mental disabilities.

[https://tasz.hu/en/freedom-of-assembly '''Freedom of Assembly''']
The program covers the freedom of organizing and holding demonstrations, protests and how the state and the police can ensure this fundamental freedom. HCLU provides legal counsal to all citizens wishing to practice the freedom of assembly.

'''Rule of Law Programme'''

The '''International Peace Garden''' is a {{convert|3.65|sqmi|adj=on}} [[park]] located adjacent to the [[International Peace Garden Border Crossing]] between [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], in the state of [[North Dakota]] and the province of [[Manitoba]]. It was established on July 14, 1932, as a symbol of the peaceful relationship between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacegarden.com/history.html|title=Page not found - International Peace Garden|website=International Peace Garden}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend "Peace Garden State" was added to [[vehicle registration plates of North Dakota]]  in 1956, and adopted by the [[North Dakota Legislative Assembly]] in 1957 as the official [[List of U.S. state nicknames|state nickname]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nd.gov/content.htm?parentCatID=74&amp;id=Nicknames|title=Nicknames|work=nd.gov|publisher=North Dakota State Government|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The park plants over 150,000 flowers each year. Main features of the garden include an {{convert|18|ft|adj=on}} floral clock display, and fountains.  A [[Carillon|chime]], and twin {{convert|120|ft|adj=on}} concrete towers straddled the border with a peace [[chapel]] at their base; the chapel walls were inscribed with notable quotes about peace. However, the concrete towers had been declared unsafe due to irreparable weather-related erosion and were demolished in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/international-peace-garden-progress-continues-as-demolition-of-iconic-tower/article_35383590-174e-52d8-b9de-0b71692d452c.html|title=International Peace Garden progress continues as demolition of iconic Tower nears|first=ALLY KRUPINSKY Forum News|last=Service|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arma Sifton bells are a chime of 14 bells cast by [[Gillett &amp; Johnston]] bellfounders. The bells were a gift from Central United Church of [[Brandon, Manitoba]], in 1972. The tower was supplied by North Dakota Veterans and dedicated in 1976. Some building remains of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] attacks of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], have been placed in part of the garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacegarden.com/|title=Home - International Peace Garden|website=International Peace Garden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Masonic Auditorium, built in the shape of a Masonic [[Square and Compasses]], was completed in 1981 as centennial project  of Grand Lodges of Manitoba and North Dakota and features seating for 2,000  people. The Peace Garden Lodge of Freemasons holds an annual communication on the property. The  officers, ritual and program are rotated each year between the Grand Lodges of Manitoba, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Saskatchewan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Masonic Tour Guide - Volume 1|last=Hanttula|first=Daniel|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=978-1-365-94725-4|location=|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Peace Garden hosts two youth camps every summer, the [[International Music Camp]] and the [[Legion Athletic Camp]].  Additionally, it has hosted the International Hamfest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ve4qk.org/ve4qk/ihf.htm|title=International Hamfest|website=International Hamfest}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an [[Amateur Radio]] meet-up, every year since 1964.

Located at the garden is the [[North American Game Warden Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewardenmuseum.org/|title=Home - North American Game Warden Museum|website=North American Game Warden Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park lies near the center of the [[Turtle Mountain (plateau)|Turtle Mountain plateau]], whose climate, topography, wildlife, and natural vegetation differ considerably from the surrounding prairies.

==Access==

The park is located north of [[Dunseith, North Dakota]], at the northern terminus of [[U.S. Highway 281]] in northwestern [[Rolette County, North Dakota|Rolette County]]. It is also adjacent to the southeast corner of [[Turtle Mountain Provincial Park]] in the [[Municipality of Boissevain – Morton]], south of [[Boissevain, Manitoba]], at the southern terminus of [[Manitoba Provincial Highway 10]].  There is a $20.00 fee per vehicle.

Visitors from either country can enter the park via US 281 or MB 10, without passing through [[customs]], and may move throughout the park (crossing the [[Canada–United States border|international boundary]] at will) without restriction. However, customs stations for Canada and the U.S. are located on the roads just north and south (respectively) of the access drives for the garden, requiring all visitors – including those returning to the country from which they arrived – to go through the immigration procedures of their destination country upon leaving the garden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacegarden.com/ International Peace Garden official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International Peace Garden Airport]] is located to the east of the garden on the U.S. side of the border.

'''Internationalism''' is a political principle which transcends [[nationalism]] and advocates a greater political or economic cooperation among nations and people.&lt;ref&gt;"Internationalism is... described as the theory and practice of transnational or global cooperation. As a political ideal, it is based on the belief that nationalism should be transcended because the ties that bind people of different nations are stronger than those that separate them." N. D. Arora, ''Political Science'', McGraw-Hill Education. {{ISBN|0-07-107478-3}}, (p.2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of this principle are referred to as internationalists, and generally believe that the people of the world should unite across national, political, cultural, racial, or class boundaries to advance their common interests, or that the governments of the world should cooperate because their mutual long-term interests are of greater importance than their short-term disputes.

==Origins==
[[File:1846 - Anti-Corn Law League Meeting.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Meeting of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]], 1846.]]
In 19th-century [[United Kingdom of Britain and Ireland|UK]] there was a [[Liberal internationalism|liberal internationalist]] strand of political thought epitomized by [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]]. Cobden and Bright were against the [[protectionist]] [[Corn Law]]s and in a speech at [[Covent Garden]] on September 28, 1843 Cobden outlined his utopian brand of internationalism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''[[Free trade|Free Trade]]! What is it? Why, breaking down the barriers that separate nations; those barriers behind which nestle the feelings of [[pride]], [[revenge]], [[hatred]] and jealously, which every now and then burst their bounds and deluge whole countries with blood... [http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2004/09/peace_and_free_.html]''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cobden believed that Free Trade would pacify the world by [[interdependence]], an idea also expressed by [[Adam Smith]] in his [[The Wealth of Nations]] and common to many liberals of the time. A belief in the idea of the [[Moral absolutism|moral law]] and an inherent goodness in [[human nature]] also inspired their faith in internationalism.

Such "liberal" conceptions of internationalism were harshly criticized by socialists and radicals at the time, who pointed out the links between global economic competition and imperialism, and would identify this competition as being a root cause of world conflict. One of the first international organisations in the world was the [[International Workingmen's Association]], formed in London in 1864 by working class socialist and communist political activists (including Karl Marx). Referred to as the First International, the organization was dedicated to the advancement of working class political interests across national boundaries, and was in direct ideological opposition to strains of liberal internationalism which advocated free trade and capitalism as means of achieving world peace and interdependence.

Other international organizations included the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], established in 1889 by [[Frédéric Passy]] from [[France]] and [[William Randal Cremer]] from the [[United Kingdom]], and the League of Nations, which was formed after [[World War I]]. The former was envisioned as a permanent forum for political multilateral negotiations, while the latter was an attempt to solve the world's security problems through international arbitration and dialogue.

[[Image:Ramsay MacDonald ggbain.37952.jpg|thumb|190x190px|left|[[Ramsay MacDonald]], a political spokesman for internationalism.]]
[[J. A. Hobson]], a [[Gladstonian Liberalism|Gladstonian liberal]] who became a [[socialist]] after the [[World War I|Great War]], anticipated in his book ''Imperialism'' (1902) the growth of international courts and congresses which would hopefully settle international disputes between nations in a peaceful way. Sir [[Norman Angell]] in his work ''The Great Illusion'' (1910) claimed that the world was united by trade, finance, industry and communications and that therefore nationalism was an anachronism and that war would not profit anyone involved but would only result in destruction.

[[Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian|Lord Lothian]] was an internationalist and an [[imperialist]] who in December 1914 looked forward to:
''...the voluntary federation of the free civilised nations which will eventually exorcise the spectre of competitive armaments and give lasting peace to mankind.''&lt;ref&gt;J.R.M. Butler, ''Lord Lothian 1882-1940'' (Macmillan, 1960), p.&amp;nbsp;56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1915 he thought the [[British Empire]] was 'the perfect example of the eventual world [[Commonwealth]]'&lt;ref&gt;J.R.M. Butler, ''Lord Lothian 1882-1940'' (Macmillan, 1960), p.&amp;nbsp;57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationalism expressed itself in Britain through the endorsement of the [[League of Nations]] by such people as [[Gilbert Murray]]. The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had prominent internationalist members, like the Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Ramsay MacDonald]] who believed that 'our true [[nationality]] is mankind'&lt;ref&gt;Lord Vansittart, ''The Mist Procession'', p.&amp;nbsp;373&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialism==
{{Socialism sidebar}}
Internationalism is an important component of [[Socialism|socialist]] political theory,&lt;ref&gt;"Internationalism is the bedrock of socialism, not simply or mainly for sentimental reasons but because capitalism has created a world economy that can be transformed only on a world scale." - Duncan Hallas. ''The Comintern'': "Introduction to the 1985 Edition". Bookmarks. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The international character of the socialist revolution [...] flows from the present state of the economy and the social structure of humanity. Internationalism is no abstract principle but a theoretical and political reflection of the character of world economy, of the world development of productive forces, and of the world scale of the class struggle." - Leon Trotsky.''The Permanent Revolution''. 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; based on the principle that working-class people of all countries must unite across national boundaries and actively oppose nationalism and war in order to overthrow capitalism&lt;ref&gt;"The Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationality. The working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they have not got.... United [worker's] action, of the leading civilized countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat." - Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. ''The Communist Manifesto''. Chapter 2: Proletarians and Communists&lt;/ref&gt; (see entry on [[proletarian internationalism]]). In this sense, the socialist understanding of internationalism is closely related to the concept of international [[solidarity]].

Socialist thinkers such as [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], and [[Vladimir Lenin]] argue that economic class, rather than nationality, race, or culture, is the main force which divides people in society, and that nationalist ideology is a [[propaganda]] tool of a society's dominant economic class. From this perspective, it is in the ruling class' interest to promote nationalism in order to hide the inherent class conflicts at play within a given society (such as the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] by capitalists for profit). Therefore, socialists see nationalism as a form of ideological control arising from a society's given mode of economic production (see [[dominant ideology]]).

Since the 19th century, socialist political organizations and radical trade unions such as the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] have promoted internationalist ideologies and sought to organize workers across national boundaries to achieve improvements in the conditions of labor and advance various forms of [[Workplace democracy|industrial democracy]]. The [[International Workingmen's Association|First]], [[Second International|Second]], [[Communist International|Third]], and [[Fourth International|Fourth]] Internationals were socialist political groupings which sought to advance worker's revolution across the globe and achieve international socialism (see [[world revolution]]).

Socialist internationalism is [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]], and therefore supports the [[National liberation movements|liberation]] of peoples from all forms of [[colonialism]] and foreign domination, and the right of nations to [[self-determination]]. Therefore, socialists have often aligned themselves politically with anti-colonial independence movements, and actively opposed the exploitation of one country by another.&lt;ref&gt;"National self-determination is the same as the struggle for complete national liberation, for complete independence, against annexation, and socialists cannot—without ceasing to be socialists—reject such a struggle in whatever form, right down to an uprising or war." - V.I. Lenin. ''A Caricature of Marxism and Imperialist Economism''. 1916. Marxists Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since war is understood in socialist theory to be a general product of the laws of economic competition inherent to capitalism (i.e., competition between capitalists and their respective national governments for natural resources and economic dominance), [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideologies which promote international capitalism and "free trade", even if they sometimes speak in positive terms of international cooperation, are, from the socialist standpoint, rooted in the very economic forces which drive world conflict. In socialist theory, world peace can only come once economic competition has been ended and class divisions within society have ceased to exist. This idea was expressed in 1848 by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in ''The Communist Manifesto'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another will also be put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marx|first1=Karl|last2=Engels|first2=Friedrich|title=The Communist Manifesto: Proletarians and Communists|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm|website=Marxists Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea was reiterated later by Lenin and advanced as the official policy of the [[Bolshevik Party|Bolshevik]] party during World War I:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Socialists have always condemned war between nations as barbarous and brutal. But our attitude towards war is fundamentally different from that of the bourgeois pacifists (supporters and advocates of peace) and of the Anarchists. We differ from the former in that we understand the inevitable connection between wars and the class struggle within the country; we understand that war cannot be abolished unless classes are abolished and Socialism is created."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lenin|first1=V.I.|title=Socialism and War|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/s+w/ch01.htm#s3|website=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The International Workingmen's Association===

[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumbnail|right|Karl Marx was a prominent member of the First International, who drafted many of their pamphlets and statements]]The [[International Workingmen's Association]], or First International, was an organization founded in 1864, composed of various working class radicals and trade unionists who promoted an ideology of internationalist socialism and anti-imperialism. Figures such as Karl Marx and anarchist revolutionary [[Mikhail Bakunin]] would play prominent roles in the First International. The ''Inaugural Address of the First International'', written by Marx in October 1864 and distributed as a pamphlet, contained calls for international cooperation between working people, and condemnations of the imperialist policies of national aggression undertaken by the governments of Europe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"If the emancipation of the working classes requires their fraternal concurrence, how are they to fulfill that great mission with a foreign policy in pursuit of criminal designs, playing upon national prejudices, and squandering in piratical wars the people’s blood and treasure?"''&lt;ref&gt;"If the emancipation of the working classes requires their fraternal concurrence, how are they to fulfill that great mission with a foreign policy in pursuit of criminal designs, playing upon national prejudices, and squandering in piratical wars the people’s blood and treasure? It was not the wisdom of the ruling classes, but the heroic resistance to their criminal folly by the working classes of England, that saved the west of Europe from plunging headlong into an infamous crusade for the perpetuation and propagation of slavery on the other side of the Atlantic. The shameless approval, mock sympathy, or idiotic indifference with which the upper classes of Europe have witnessed the mountain fortress of the Caucasus falling a prey to, and heroic Poland being assassinated by, Russia: the immense and unresisted encroachments of that barbarous power, whose head is in St. Petersburg, and whose hands are in every cabinet of Europe, have taught the working classes the duty to master themselves the mysteries of international politics; to watch the diplomatic acts of their respective governments; to counteract them, if necessary, by all means in their power; when unable to prevent, to combine in simultaneous denunciations, and to vindicate the simple laws or morals and justice, which ought to govern the relations of private individuals, as the rules paramount of the intercourse of nations.  The fight for such a foreign policy forms part of the general struggle for the emancipation of the working classes." - Karl Marx. ''Inaugural Address of the International Workingmen's Association''. 1864&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the mid-1870s, splits within the International over tactical and ideological questions would lead to the organization's demise and pave the way for the formation of the [[Second International]] in 1889. One faction, with Marx as the figurehead, argued that workers and radicals must work within parliaments in order to win political supremacy and create a worker's government. The other major faction were the [[Anarchism|anarchists]], led by Bakunin, who saw all state institutions as inherently oppressive, and thus opposed any parliamentary activity and believed that workers action should be aimed at the total destruction of the state.

===The Socialist International===

The Socialist International, known as the Second International, was founded in 1889 after the disintegration of the International Workingmen's Association. Unlike the First International, it was a federation of socialist political parties from various countries, including both reformist and revolutionary groupings. The parties of the Second International were the first socialist parties to win mass support among the working class and have representatives elected to parliaments. These parties, such as the German Social-Democratic Labor Party, were the first socialist parties in history to emerge as serious political players on the parliamentary stage, often gaining millions of members.

Ostensibly committed to peace and anti-imperialism, the International Socialist Congress held its final meeting in Basel, Switzerland in 1912, in anticipation of the outbreak of World War I. The manifesto adopted at the Congress outlined the Second International's opposition to the war and its commitment to a speedy and peaceful resolution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If a war threatens to break out, it is the duty of the working classes and their parliamentary representatives in the countries involved supported by the coordinating activity of the International Socialist Bureau to exert every effort in order to prevent the outbreak of war by the means they consider most effective, which naturally vary according to the sharpening of the class struggle and the sharpening of the general political situation.

In case war should break out anyway it is their duty to intervene in favor of its speedy termination and with all their powers to utilize the economic and political crisis created by the war to arouse the people and thereby to hasten the downfall of capitalist class rule."&lt;ref&gt;Manifesto of the International Socialist Congress at Basel. 1912. https://www.marxists.org/history/international/social-democracy/1912/basel-manifesto.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite this, when the war began in 1914, the majority of the Socialist parties of the International turned on each other and sided with their respective governments in the war effort, betraying their internationalist values and leading to the dissolution of the Second International. This betrayal led the few anti-war delegates left within the Second International to organize the [[Zimmerwald Conference|International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald, Switzerland]] in 1915. Known as the Zimmerwald Conference, its purpose was to formulate a platform of opposition to the war. The conference was unable to reach agreement on all points, but ultimately was able to publish the Zimmerwald Manifesto, which was drafted by Leon Trotsky. The most left-wing and stringently internationalist delegates at the conference were organized around Lenin and the Russian Social Democrats, and known as the [[Zimmerwald Left]]. They bitterly condemned the war and what they described as the hypocritical "social-chauvinists" of the Second International, who so quickly abandoned their internationalist principles and refused to oppose the war. The Zimmerwald Left resolutions urged all socialists who were committed to the internationalist principles of socialism to struggle against the war and commit to international workers' revolution.&lt;ref&gt;International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald. https://www.marxists.org/history/international/social-democracy/zimmerwald/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The betrayal of the social-democrats and the organization of the Zimmerwald Left would ultimately set the stage for the emergence of the world's first modern communist parties and the formation of the Third International in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;The Zimmerwald Left. https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/z/i.htm#zimmerwald-left&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Communist International===

[[File:Kustodiev - Congress of Comintern.JPG|thumbnail|right|Boris Kustodiyev. Festival of the II Congress of Comintern on the Uritsky Square (former Palace square) in Petrograd]]The Communist International, also known as the Comintern or the Third International, was formed in 1919 in the wake of the [[Russian Revolution]], the end of the first World War, and the dissolution of the Second International. It was an association of communist political parties from throughout the world dedicated to proletarian internationalism and the revolutionary overthrow of the world bourgeoisie. The ''Manifesto of the Communist International'', written by [[Leon Trotsky]], describes the political orientation of the international as "against imperialist barbarism, against monarchy, against the privileged estates, against the bourgeois state and bourgeois property, against all kinds and forms of class or national oppression".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1924/ffyci-1/ch01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Fourth International===

The fourth and last socialist international was founded by Leon Trotsky and his followers in 1938 in opposition to the Third International and the direction taken by the USSR under the leadership of Joseph Stalin. The [[Fourth International]] declared itself to be the true ideological successor of the original Comintern under Lenin, carrying on the banner of proletarian internationalism which had been abandoned by Stalin's Comintern. A variety of still active left-wing political organizations claim to be the contemporary successors of Trotsky's original Fourth International.

==Modern expression==

Internationalism is most commonly expressed as an appreciation for the diverse cultures in the world, and a desire for [[world peace]]. People who express this view believe in not only being a citizen of their respective countries, but of being a [[World citizen|citizen of the world]]. Internationalists feel obliged to assist the world through leadership and charity.

Internationalists also advocate the presence of international organizations, such as the [[United Nations]], and often support a stronger form of a world government.

Contributors to the current version of internationalism include [[Albert Einstein]], who was a socialist and  believed in a world government, and classified the follies of [[nationalism]] as "an infantile sickness".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein, The World as I see it, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, other internationalists such as [[Christian Lous Lange|Christian Lange]] &lt;ref&gt;"“Internationalism . . . recognizes, by its very name, that nations do exist. It simply limits their scope more than one-sided nationalism does." Lange quoted in Jay Nordlinger, ''Peace They Say: A History of the Nobel Peace Prize, the Most Famous and Controversial Prize in the World''.   Encounter Books, 2013. {{ISBN|1-59403-599-7}} (p. 111).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rebecca West]] &lt;ref&gt;"The European tradition...from the very beginning has recognised the nationalism and internationalism are not irreconcible opposities but counterbalances that can keep the nations in equilibrium". Rebecca West, “The Necessity and Grandeur of the International Ideal", 1935. Reprinted in Patrick Deane, ''History In Our Hands : a critical anthology of writings on literature, culture, and politics from the 1930s''. London ; Leicester University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-7185-0143-3}}, (p. 76).&lt;/ref&gt; saw little conflict between holding nationalist and internationalist positions.

===International organizations and internationalism===
For both intergovernmental organizations and international non-governmental organizations to emerge, nations and peoples had to be strongly aware that they shared certain interests and objectives across national boundaries and they could best solve their many problems by pooling their resources and effecting transnational cooperation, rather than through individual countries' unilateral efforts. Such a view, such global consciousness, may be termed internationalism, the idea that nations and peoples should cooperate instead of preoccupying themselves with their respective national interests or pursuing uncoordinated approaches to promote them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Iriye|first=Akira|title=Global Community|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|location=London|pages=9, 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sovereign nations vs. supranational powers balance===
Internationalism, in the strict meaning of the word, is still based on the existence of [[sovereign nation]]s. Its aims are to encourage [[multilateralism]] (world leadership not held by any single country) and create some formal and informal interdependence between countries, with some limited [[supranationalism|supranational powers]] given to [[international organisation]]s controlled by those nations via [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] treaties and institutions.

The ideal of many internationalists, among them [[world citizen]]s, is to go a step further towards [[alter-globalization|democratic globalization]] by creating a [[world government]]. However, this idea is opposed and/or thwarted by other internationalists, who believe any World Government body would be inherently too powerful to be trusted, or because they dislike the path taken by supranational entities such as the [[United Nations]] or the [[European Union]] and fear that a world government inclined towards [[fascism]] would emerge from the former. These internationalists are more likely to support a loose world [[federation]] in which most power resides with the national governments.

===Literature and criticism===
In [[Jacques Derrida]]’s 1993 work, ''[[Specters of Marx]]: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International'', he uses [[Shakespeare]]’s ''[[Hamlet]]'' to frame a discussion of the history of the International, ultimately proposing his own vision for a “New International” that is less reliant on large-scale international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, Jacques. ''Specters of Marx, the state of the debt, the Work of Mourning, &amp; the New International'', translated by Peggy Kamuf, Routledge, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; As he puts it, the New International should be “without status ... without coordination, without party, without country, without national community, without co-citizenship, without common belonging to a class.”

Through Derrida’s use of ''Hamlet'', he shows the influence that Shakespeare had on Marx and Engel’s work on internationalism. In his essay, “Big Leagues: Specters of Milton and Republican International Justice between Shakespeare and Marx,” Christopher N. Warren makes the case that English poet [[John Milton]] also had a substantial influence on Marx and Engel’s work.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher N (2016). “[https://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6VW8W Big Leagues: Specters of Milton and Republican International Justice between Shakespeare and Marx].” ''Humanity: An International Journal of Human Rights, Humanitarianism, and Development'', Vol. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paradise Lost'', in particular, shows “the possibility of political actions oriented toward international justice founded outside the aristocratic order.”&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher N (2016). “[https://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6VW8W Big Leagues: Specters of Milton and Republican International Justice between Shakespeare and Marx].” ''Humanity: An International Journal of Human Rights, Humanitarianism, and Development'', Vol. 7. Pg. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx and Engels, Warren claims, understood the empowering potential of Miltonic republican traditions for forging international coalitions—a lesson, perhaps, for “The New International.”

==Other uses==
* In a less restricted sense, "internationalism" is a word describing the impetus and motivation for the creation of any [[international organization]]s. The earliest such example of broad internationalism would be the drive to replace feudal systems of measurement with the [[metric system]], long before the creation of international organizations like the [[World Court]], the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]].
* In [[linguistics]], an "internationalism" is a [[loanword]] that, originating in one language, has been borrowed by most other languages. Examples of such borrowings include "OK", "[[microscope]]" and "[[tokamak]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1752">A '''land monopoly''' occurs when an entity or a class is able to corner the market on land. According to [[Winston Churchill]], "Land monopoly is not the only monopoly, but it is by far the greatest of monopolies&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; it is a perpetual monopoly, and it is the mother of all other forms of monopoly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.progress.org/banneker/chur.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619155347/http://progress.org/banneker/chur.html |archivedate=2010-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[anarcho-capitalist]] [[Murray Rothbard]], "Land monopoly is far more widespread in the modern world than most people&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; especially most Americans&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; believe. In the undeveloped world, especially in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, feudal landholding is a crucial social and economic problem&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; with or without quasi-[[serf]] impositions on the persons of the peasantry."&lt;ref&gt;http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/eleven.asp&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualist]] [[Benjamin Tucker]] classified, as one of the four forms of monopoly, the state's enforcement of "land titles which do not rest upon personal occupancy and cultivation."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mutualist.org/id66.html&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous mechanisms of ameliorating land monopolization.

* The [[Land Value Tax]]
* The [[Lockean proviso]]
* [[Public land]]
* Standards of [[Abandoned property|abandonment]]
* [[Usufruct]]
* [[Easement]]
* [[Adverse possession]]

The '''Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies''', {{lang-it|'''Ministero delle Politiche Agricole, Alimentari e Forestali'''|italic=no}} or '''MiPAAF''', is an [[Italian government]] department.  

It was formed in 1946 as the '''Ministero dell'Agricoltura e delle Foreste''' ("Ministry of Agriculture and Forests"), and following the [[Italian referendum, 1993|referendum]] of 1993 became the '''Ministero per il Coordinamento delle Politiche Agricole''' ("Ministry for Co-ordination of Agricultural Policies"). It was reconstituted in the same year as the '''Ministero delle Risorse Agricole, Alimentari e Forestali''' ("Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Resources") and assumed the current form in 2006, after the organisational reforms of 2005.

The Ministry, based at the Palazzo dell'Agricoltura in Rome, produces and co-ordinates government policy on agriculture, forests, food and fisheries at national, European and international level.

The current [[Italian Minister of Agriculture|Minister of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies]] is [[Gian Marco Centinaio]].

==Litigation==

The [[European Commission]] initially refused to register the initiative, in 2013. The authors (who include [[Hunor Kelemen]], [[Anke Spoorendonk]], [[Karl-Heinz Lambertz]], [[Luis Durnwalder]] and [[Valentin Inzko]]) have appealed the refusal in court, where they were joined by Hungary and the Commission - by Slovakia and Romania. The [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]] annulled the Commission decision in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=187422&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=1477286|title=Judgment of the General Court in Case T‑646/13|website=curia.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, the Commission decided to launch collection of signatures for 9 of 11 proposals initially included in the initiative.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;

The referendum took place amidst a broader [[English-only movement]] in the [[United States]]. Most of the funding for the initiative came from the [[Virginia]]-based lobbying organization, [[ProEnglish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;blockquote&gt;English is the official language of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee. Official actions which bind or commit the government shall be taken only in the English language, and all official government communications and publications shall be in English. No person shall have a right to government services in any other language. All meetings of the Metro Council, Boards, and Commissions of the Metropolitan Government shall be conducted in English. The Metro Council may make specific exceptions to protect public health and safety. Nothing in this measure shall be interpreted to conflict with federal or state law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Components==

Accordingly, there were five components to Proposal 1:

* Declaring an [[official language]] of the city and county
* Official actions "taken only" in English; communications and publications in English
* No right to non-English services
* Establishing language of government meetings
* Exceptions for federal law, state law, and specific situations chosen by the Council but only on the grounds of health and safety

Previous efforts to pass this type of legislation had been met with vigorous opposition from then-Nashville Mayor [[Bill Purcell (mayor)|Bill Purcell]], who argued that the passage of an ordinance making English the official language of Nashville would create legal confusion, resulting in countless lawsuits.  In his statement vetoing the ordinance in February, 2007, Purcell said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;If this law takes effect, this city will be engaged in years of lawsuits testing the effect and constitutionality of the ordinance. That means hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees whether we win or lose, for no good reason.&lt;ref name="Mayor's Statement Regarding Veto of English-Only Amendment"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proponents of the proposal referred to it as "English First" while opponents called it "English Only" - each side claimed that the other side's terminology was misleading.&lt;ref name="Official English Is Not English Only"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proenglish.org/notenglishonly.html |title=Official English Is Not English Only |accessdate=2008-12-05 |publisher=ProEnglish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017104546/http://proenglish.org/notenglishonly.html |archivedate=October 17, 2008 }}

Supporters of Proposal 1 argued that government communication in only one language is simple and cost-effective and provides an incentive to non-English speakers to learn the language.&lt;ref name="Nashville English First" /&gt;  The proponents of Proposal 1 were represented by Nashville English First, the brainchild of Nashvillians Jon Crisp and Eric Crafton,&lt;ref name="Spitball sessions"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents argued that the measure is antagonistic toward immigrants in transition, redundant in that English was already the "official and legal language" of Tennessee, and that passage of the measure could damage Nashville's reputation as a welcoming city, its international economy, its budget, and its safety.&lt;ref name="Nashville for All of Us web site"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5355">The '''National Arms Association of Spain''' (Spanish: Asociación Nacional del Arma, abbr. ANARMA) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[non-profit organisation]] which defends the ownership and [[recreational]] use of [[firearms]] by law-abiding citizens (and foreign residents) under [[Nation|national]] [[legislation]]. As current legislation is restrictive by nature,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/spain Spain: Gun Facts, Figures and the Law]&lt;/ref&gt; most effort is placed on the adaptation of national laws to [[EU directive]], and defending the [[right to keep and bear arms|rights of gun owners]] by legal means. Since [[self-defense]] is not considered as sufficient motive for acquiring a firearm licence (compulsory for all arms and related activities), the principal collectives represented by the association consist of [[Shooting sport|precision]] and [[Practical shooting|practical shooters]], [[hunters]] and arms [[collecting|collectors]].

==History==
The National Arms Association was founded in 2003, after a proposed [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] had threatened to introduce significant modifications to firearms [[regulations]] (firearms are governed by special regulations rather than [[statutory law]]). Although the initiative gained a fair share of acceptance at its inception, the fact the bill was never brought to a vote as well as internal conflicts, brought about its near dissolution.

The association’s resurgence took place in 2010, after presentation of a new bill, introducing important modifications to arms regulations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2011/07/09/pdfs/BOE-A-2011-11778.pdf Real Decreto 976/2011] (in Spanish).&lt;/ref&gt; mobilised the principal affected groups. The association's involvement in the process which led to the dismissal of most of these modifications, as well as its leading role in the withdrawal of another bill, this time on [[ammunition]] and [[Pyrotechnics|pyrotechnic materials]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uclm.es/cr/EUP-ALMADEN/aaaeupa/boletin_informativo/pdf/boletines/19/10.pdf Real Decreto 563/2010] (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; helped it gain popularity among its [[target audience]].

==Objectives==
According to its constitution act,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarma.org/content/category/30/1/ ANARMA's statutes] (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; the Spanish Arms Association has two main objectives: representing the interests of its members and defending their rights, on one hand, and raising awareness among citizenship, as well as the institutions, in regard with the varied facets of firearms-related activities.

The association argues that Spanish authorities disregard their constitutional obligation to boost recreational sport activities, including those related to firearms. Another argument maintains that current legislation, let alone the proposed modifications, fails to meet EU regulations. The association also defends the preservation of national heritage, from made-in-Spain firearms, to related artisan and [[Artisan|craftsmen]] trades such as [[Sword making|sword-forging]], considered to be nearly extinct.

The Spanish Arms Association is not associated with any political party or [[umbrella organisation]], mostly because, unlike other organisations of its kind, it wouldn’t operate as a [[Lobbying|lobby]]. This is made possible by the fact that firearms manufacturers, in spite of many being members of ANARMA, are normally formally represented by other, professional associations, which protect their commercial interests. The association’s funding comes from membership fees and the sale of promotional items.

==Organisational structure==
President;

Executive Vicepresident;

Vicepresident of Communication;

Secretary and Treasurer;

Regional delegates;

Coordinators and delegates to other countries;

Other, minor positions;

==International collaboration==
The Spanish Gun Association is a member of the Foundation for European Societies of Arms Collectors (FESAC by its initials in French),&lt;ref&gt;[http://fesac.eu/?page_id=2 FESAC members and board]&lt;/ref&gt; which played a major role in the drawing up of European policy on gun laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fesac.eu/?page_id=2 Negotiating with the EU Institutions leading to adoption of Amendments to the EU Firearms Directive]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30th, 2012 ANARMA has become a full member of the [[International Association for the Protection of Civilian Arms Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegunmag.com/?p=735 Spanish Gun Rights Group Joins IAPCAR]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that the NRA was the principal advisor during ANARMA’s restoration at the turn of 2010.

'''''N.Y. State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres''''', 552 U.S. 196 (2008), was a case decided by the [[United States Supreme Court]] that involved a constitutional challenge brought against [[New York State|New York State's]] judicial election law, alleging that it unfairly prevented candidates from obtaining access to the ballot. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] rejected this challenge and held that the state's election laws did not infringe upon candidates' [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] associational rights. Several concurring justices emphasized, however, that their decision reflected only the constitutionality of the state's election system, and not its wisdom or merit.

==Background: New York state judicial election process==
In New York, political party judicial candidates for the [[New York State Supreme Court|Supreme Courts]] (the state's [[general jurisdiction]] [[trial court]]) are elected through a three-part scheme that involves a [[primary election]], a nominating convention, and a [[general election]]. Independent candidates need only meet general signature requirements to obtain a place on the general ballot.

During the primary election, judicial delegates (not candidates) are elected by the parties' rank and file members for each assembly district. The chosen delegates are sent to the judicial convention for the judicial district in which the assembly district is located. (The state is split into twelve judicial districts, each having up to several dozen assembly districts.) The judicial delegates vote for their parties' judicial nominees, whose names are listed on the general ballot.

A person seeking a political party judicial nomination, accordingly, must assemble a delegate (or group of delegates, who run together) for each assembly district in their judicial district. They must collect separate signatures in each assembly district to get supporting delegate(s) onto the primary ballot and, because delegate nominees cannot disclose which candidate they are affiliated with, they must also mount separate voter education campaigns in each assembly district to explain to the voters which delegates are representing which candidate. After being elected, the delegates can theoretically choose any judicial candidate they wish, but the short timeframe between the primary election and the convention (about two weeks), and the overriding influence of the party establishment, mean that delegates typically do not exercise independent judgment in choosing which candidates to support. The process is too onerous for candidates without significant financial resources or the support of their political party's apparatus, reducing opportunity for independent candidates.&lt;ref&gt;''Lopez Torrez v. N.Y. State Bd. of Elections,'' 462 F.3d 161, 171-178 (2d Cir. 2006), overruled 552 U.S. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See also '' Norman L.

L. Rev.'' 633, 645-6464 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts and procedural posture==
Margarita Lopez Torres received the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination and was elected to the civil court for [[Kings County, New York|Kings County]] in 1992, becoming the first Latina to be elected to the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blazing a Trail, and Following Her Own Sense of What's Right |first=Robin |last=Finn |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/25/nyregion/25lives.html?_r=1 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 25, 2008 |accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She allegedly fell out of favor with local party leaders shortly thereafter for refusing to make [[patronage]] hires. She claimed that party leaders later refused to support her candidacy for the [[New York State Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in 1997, 2002, and 2003. Lopez Torres, along with similarly situated candidates, their supporters, and the public interest group [[Common Cause]], brought suit in federal court against the state Board of Elections, claiming that the nomination system deprived voters and their candidates of their rights to gain access to the ballot and to associate in their parties' primaries.

The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York|District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] and the [[Second Circuit]] held in favor of Lopez Torres, finding that the voters and candidates possessed a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to a 
&lt;blockquote&gt;'realistic opportunity to participate in [a political party's] nominating process, and to do so free from burdens that are both severe and unnecessary.' New York's electoral law violated that right because of the quantity of signatures and delegate recruits required to obtain a Supreme Court nomination at a judicial convention..., and because of the apparent reality that party leaders can control delegates....&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=New York State Board of Elections v. Lopez Torres|volume=552|page=196|pin=202|year=2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Supreme Court's decision==
A nearly unanimous court in "Lopez Torres" overruled the Second Circuit and upheld the constitutionality of New York's judicial election system. The court explained that although a political party has a First Amendment associational right to choose its candidates, that right is circumscribed when the party is given a role in the state's election process. Parties that are formally involved in the election process, for example, may be required to comply with a primary process and may be prohibited from maintaining racially discriminatory policies (which could become impermissible [[State action (United States constitutional law)|state action]]).

But, the court explained, the political parties' associational rights were not at issue in the case; rather, the "weapon wielded by these plaintiffs is their ''own'' claimed associational right not only to join, but to have a certain degree of influence in, the party."&lt;ref&gt;''Lopez Torrez,'' 552 U.S. at 203.&lt;/ref&gt; In refusing to acknowledge the existence of such a right, the court explained that nothing in the law prohibited the candidates from attending the convention and lobbying the delegates, and nothing in the law compelled the delegates to vote for their parties' preferred candidates. As the court explained, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our cases invalidating ballot-access requirements have focused on the requirements themselves, and not on the manner in which political actors function under those requirements. . . . None of our cases establishes an individual's constitutional right to have a 'fair shot' at winning the party's nomination.&lt;ref&gt;''Lopez Torrez,'' 552 U.S. at 205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court also rejected the plaintiffs' contention that the existence of entrenched "one-party rule" rendered the general election uncompetitive. As the Court noted, candidates could obtain a place on the ballot, without party affiliation, via New York's general petition-signature requirements.

==Concurring opinions==
[[Justice Stevens]], joined by [[Justice Souter]], wrote a concurring opinion to emphasize that the court's decision dealt with the constitutionality of New York's judicial election system, and not its wisdom. He quoted Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]], saying "The Constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws."

[[Justice Kennedy]]'s concurring opinion emphasized that the political party nomination was not the sole method of securing a place on the ballot. As he explained, a person seeking a Supreme Court judgeship could alternatively meet general petition-signature requirements, these being the lesser of either (1) five percent of the number of votes last cast for Governor in the judicial district or (2) either 3,500 or 4,000 signatures (depending on the district). Were this route to the ballot not available, he suggested that the constitutionality of New York's election laws would be in greater doubt. In the second part of his opinion, which was joined by [[Justice Breyer]], Justice Kennedy discussed the important role that elections can play in the selection of judges, but warned that they might also foster abuse and manipulation. He stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;If New York statutes for nominating and electing judges do not produce both the perception and the reality of a system committed to the highest ideals of the law, they ought to be changed and to be changed now. But, as the Court today holds, . . . the present suit does not permit us to invoke the Constitution in order to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;''Lopez Torrez,'' 552 U.S. at 213 (Kennedy, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While some anti-abortion protests take on violent forms, the bulk of anti-abortion movement focuses on a series of physically non-violent tactics but possibly emotionally violent acts such as intimidation or harassment.

== Prayer ==
Praying outside of abortion providers is one of the most common tactics employed by abortion protestors. Protestors station outside of clinics, generally in groups, and pray silently or out loud for the fetuses that are terminated by abortion. While groups generally claim that they are motivated by good-will, some scholars believe that the tactic often serves to intimidate and shame patients at these clinics.

== Sidewalk counseling ==
Sidewalk counseling is a common tactic employed by anti-abortion protestors. Protestors station outside of or near entrances to clinics, and attempt to convince patients entering not to complete the procedure. Common tactics used by counselors include offering information about alternatives to terminating a pregnancy such as adoption or keeping the baby, community resources, and fetal development information. 

The frequency with which clinics are occupied by sidewalk counselors vary widely among clinics and on a state-by-state basis. Joseph Scheidler, author of Closed: 99 Ways to Stop Abortion and the authority anti-abortion protesting, calls sidewalk counseling “the single most valuable activity that a pro-life person can engage in.” According to Schedler, pro-life counseling “comes between the baby who is scheduled to be killed and the doctor who will do the killing." Scheidler recommends that anti-abortion groups should place two or three counselors at each clinic on a regular basis. The presence of those counselors will theoretically act as a deterrent to women arriving their appointment, who will see the protestors and return home, drive to another clinic, or reschedule. Without any patients, the clinics will be forced out of business, which will inherently protect more unborn children. While counselors claim to be peaceful and simply offering help to patients, some academics have referred to these counseling tactics as intimidation, rather than as a form of persuasion.

== Legal restrictions against intimidation tactics ==
Following the assassination of Dr. David Gunn and the unprecedented number of violent clinic protests and blockades that followed, Congress passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, which was signed into law by President Clinton in May 1994. FACE makes it a federal crime to use force, the threat of force, or physical obstruction to prevent women from seeking, obtaining, or providing reproductive health services.

A few states and municipalities have also enacted legal restrictions against intimidation tactics of anti-abortion protestors. The two main types of legal restrictions are buffer zone laws and bubble zone laws. Buffer zone laws limit how close demonstrators are permitted to get a facility. Bubble zone laws create floating areas around specific people (like clinic staff and their patients), and prohibit protestors from coming within a certain distance of those individuals.

'''Colorado''':  A 1999 statute passed by the Colorado state legislature creates a 100-foot buffer zone around a clinic and an 8&amp;nbsp;foot floating bubble zone around any person entering the clinic. The law prohibits any person outside those boundaries from engaging in oral protest, education, or counseling, or passing a leaflet or displaying a sign to another person without their consent. These tactics could be anything from passing a leaflet or displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education, or counseling with another person without their consent. This statute was the first law placed restrictions on non-violent forms of anti-abortion protest.

'''Montana''': In 2005, the Montana state legislature passed HB 324, which established a 36-foot buffer zone around reproductive health clinics and prevents protestors from coming within eight feet of anyone entering or leaving healthcare facility.

'''Massachusetts''': In 2007, the Massachusetts state legislature passed a bill that would create a 35-foot buffer zone around entrances, exits, and driveways of abortion clinics. The law does not include a floating buffer zone provision. The goal of the legislation was to “prevent interference with patients’ ability to access clinics and to protect them from being lectured, abused, or harassed by anti-choice activists.”

== Legal challenges to anti-abortion protestors ==

Many of these laws have been challenged on the grounds that they are restrictions on protestors’ [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to free speech and free assembly.

=== Hill v. Colorado ===

Colorado’s buffer law statute was the first to be challenged in the courts. This first challenge was [[Hill v. Colorado|petitioned by Leila Hill]] and a group of sidewalk counselors who claimed that the law violated her group’s First Amendment right to free speech. The district judge dismissed the case, citing [[Ward v. Rock Against Racism]] in its ruling that the buffer law established that the government could enforce laws that imposed content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions that were narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest.

The case eventually reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]]. In a 6–3 decision, the Court ruled that law’s regulations on speech-related conduct are constitutional. Writing for the majority, Justice John Paul Stevens argued that the statute “is not a regulation of speech. Rather, it is a regulation of the place where some speech may occur.”  While the statute prohibits speakers from approaching unwilling listeners, it does not require a speaker to move away from a passerby, or place a restriction on the content of a message. The law simply makes it more difficult to offer unwanted advice to persons entering or leaving medical facilities, and adequately balances the need to protect medical patients from unwanted communication, with the need to leave open sufficient channels of communication for protestors. Writing in dissent, [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] argued that demonstrators “don’t want to protest abortion. They want to talk to the women who are about to get abortions and try to talk them out of it. I think it distorts it to say that what they want to do is protest abortion.” Since the conversations are consensual and simply attempts to offer guidance, the law is an unconstitutional restriction on the First Amendment.

=== McCullen v. Coakley ===
{{main article|McCullen v. Coakley}}

In 2007, Eleanor McCullen, a member of [[Operation Rescue (Kansas)|Operation Rescue]], filed a lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts citing that the state’s buffer zone law was a violation of the First Amendment protection of free speech. The federal district court held that while the law placed a restriction on the time, place, and manner of the speech, the law was constitutional “because it was content-neutral and still left adequate, if not perfect, alternative means of communication.” The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower courts ruling, adding that Hill v. Colorado had already affirmed a similar statute in Colorado. On March 25, 2013, McCullen filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court, and on June 24, 2013 the petition was granted. The case was argued on January 15, 2014.

During oral arguments opponents of the law argued that the exemption for employees creates an unconstitutional imbalance in speech. Presenting McCullen as a peaceful counselor who “gently and lovingly” approaches women to convince them not to have abortion and presents patients tiny knitted caps, prosecutors argued that her anti-abortion speech is limited while the clinic of those who support the clinic is not. Alternatively, Jennifer Miller, who argued the case for Massachusetts, claimed that the restrictions on speech are warranted to prevent violence or disruptions outside the clinics. On June 26, 2014 the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the buffer zone was an unconstitutional infringement on the First Amendment because it blocked peaceful protest on public streets.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/supreme-court-decision-mccullen-v-coakley-abortion-clinic-buffer-zone&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Open Rights Group''' ('''ORG''') is a UK-based organisation that works to preserve [[digital rights]] and freedoms by campaigning on digital rights issues and by fostering a community of grassroots activists. It campaigns on numerous issues including mass surveillance, internet filtering and censorship, and intellectual property rights.

==History==
[[File:Protect your bits.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Open Rights Group poster]]The organisation was started by [[Danny O'Brien (journalist)|Danny O'Brien]], [[Cory Doctorow]], [[Ian Brown (technologist)|Ian Brown]], [[Rufus Pollock]], [[James Cronin (technologist)|James Cronin]], [[Stefan Magdalinski]], [[Louise Ferguson]] and [[Suw Charman]] after a panel discussion at Open Tech 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2005/schedule/ Open Tech 2005 schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215043405/http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2005/schedule/ |date=15 December 2005 }}, 23 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien created a pledge on [[PledgeBank]], placed on 23 July 2005, with a deadline of 25 December 2005: ''"I will create a standing order of 5 [[pound sterling|pound]]s per month to support an organisation that will campaign for digital rights in the UK but only if 1,000 other people will too."'' The pledge reached 1000 people on 29 November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pledgebank.com/rights www.pledgebank.com/rights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129094116/http://www.pledgebank.com/rights |date=29 November 2005 }}, 23 July 2005 – 25 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oblomovka.com/entries/2005/07/25#1122278040 Getting out more] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807173140/http://www.oblomovka.com/entries/2005/07/25 |date=7 August 2011 }}, [[Danny O'Brien (journalist)|Danny O'Brien]]'s blog post floating the idea and advertising the pledge&lt;/ref&gt; The Open Rights Group was launched at a "sell-out" meeting in [[Soho]], London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2005/11/29/org-digital-rights-event-update/ ORG digital rights event update], ''Open Rights Group blog'', 29 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2005/11/16/invitation-to-attend-digital-rights-in-the-uk-your-rights-your-issues/ Invitation to attend ‘Digital Rights in the UK: Your Rights, Your Issues’], ''Open Rights Group blog'', 16 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

The group was honoured in the 2008 [[Privacy International]] [[Big Brother Awards (United Kingdom)|Big Brother Awards]] alongside [[No2ID]], [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]], [[Genewatch UK]] and others, as a recognition of their efforts to keep state and corporate [[mass surveillance]] at bay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gizmonaut.net/blog/uk/big_brother_awards_2008.html Big Brother Awards UK 2008], 12 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the group worked with [[38 Degrees]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Controversial UK anti-piracy law finally passed |publisher=BBC   | date = 5 April 2010 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/rorycellanjones/2010/04/who_cares_about_the_digital_ec.html | accessdate =25 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to oppose the introduction of the [[Digital Economy Act 2010|Digital Economy Act]], which was passed in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Controversial UK anti-piracy law finally passed|publisher=Telecoms Europe|url=http://www.telecomseurope.net/content/controversial-uk-anti-piracy-law-finally-passed?section=HEADLINE|accessdate=9 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
* To collaborate with other digital rights and related organisations.
* To nurture a community of campaigning volunteers, from grassroots activists to technical and legal experts.
* To preserve and extend traditional [[civil liberties]] in the digital world.
* To provide a media [[wikt:clearing house|clearinghouse]], connecting journalists with experts and activists.
* To raise awareness in the media of [[digital rights]] abuses.

==Areas of interest==

{{Party politics}}
In U.S. politics, a '''partisan''' is a committed member of a [[political party]] or [[political coalitions]]. In [[multi-party system]]s, the term is used for politicians who strongly support their party's policies and are reluctant to compromise with their political opponents.

In the United States, the meaning of the term has changed dramatically over the last 60 years. Before the American National Election Study (described in Angus Campbell et al., in ''[[The American Voter]]'') began in 1952, an individual's partisan tendencies were typically determined from their voting behavior. Since then, "partisan" has come to refer to an individual with a psychological identification with one or the other of the major parties.

==Politicians==
Candidates, depending on their political beliefs, may choose to join a party. As it has existing Framework for career advancement, parties
are more often than not the preferred choice for candidates. Wherein there are many parties in a system, candidates often join them as opposed to standing as an Independent, if that is provided for.

In the U.S, politicians have generally been identified with a party. Many local elections in the U.S. (as for mayor) are "nonpartisan." A candidate may have a party affiliation but it is not listed on the ballot. Independents occasionally appear in major contests but rarely win. At the presidential level the best vote getters were [[Ross Perot]] in 1992 and 1996, and [[John B. Anderson]] in 1980. In 2016 [[Bernie Sanders]], an independent Senator from Vermont who [[caucus]]ed with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] for years, entered the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|Democratic Party primaries]] and made a strong second-place finish, and left the party after the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]].

===Eisenhower===
President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was nonpartisan until 1952, when he joined the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and was [[United States presidential election, 1952|elected president]]. More than any modern president he had a nonpartisan image in domestic affairs. According to David A. Crockett, "Much of Eisenhower's nonpartisan image was genuine, for he found Truman's campaigning distasteful and inappropriate, and he disliked the partisan aspects of campaigning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David A. Crockett|title=The Opposition Presidency: Leadership and the Constraints of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q8CDpM9xOwQC&amp;pg=PA139|year=2002|publisher=Texas A&amp;M UP|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; With little interest in routine partisanship, Eisenhower left much of the building and sustaining of the Republican Party to his vice president, [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Frank, ''Ike and Dick: Portrait of a Strange Political Marriage'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; "With few formal duties, Nixon threw himself into state and local politics, making hundreds of speeches across the land. With Eisenhower uninvolved in party building, Nixon became the de facto national GOP leader."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Finkelman, Peter Wallenstein, [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22With+Eisenhower+un-involved+in+party+building%22&amp;num=10#tbm=bks&amp;q=%22Nixon+threw+himself+into+state+and+local+politics%2C+making+hundreds+of+speeches+across+the+land.+With+Eisenhower+un-involved+in+party+building%2C%22 ''The encyclopedia of American political history'' (2001) p 271]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eisenhower paid close personal attention to foreign and military affairs. However in domestic policy, his avoidance of partisanship meant that he did not interfere with the conservative policies of Senate leader Robert Taft. The Democrats regained control of both houses of Congress of 1954. Eisenhower's largely nonpartisan stance allowed him to work smoothly with the Democratic leaders Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]] in the House, and Majority Leader [[Lyndon Johnson]] in the Senate. Jean Smith says that: 
:Ike, LBJ, and "Mr. Sam" did not trust one another completely and they did not see eye to eye on every issue, but they understood one another and had no difficulty working together. Eisenhower continued to meet regularly with the Republican leadership. But his weekly sessions with Rayburn and Johnson, usually in the evening, over drinks, were far more productive. For Johnson and Rayburn, it was shrewd politics to cooperate with Ike. Eisenhower was wildly popular in the country....By supporting a Republican president against the Old Guard of his own party, the Democrats hoped to share Ike's popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Edward Smith|title=Eisenhower in War and Peace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jO2gLXNNa2wC&amp;pg=PA648|year=2012|publisher=Random House |page=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partiinost'==
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar}}
'''Partiinost'''' ({{lang-ru|партийность}}) is a transliteration of a Russian term from [[Marxism-Leninism]]. It can be variously translated as party-mindedness, partisanship, or party spirit.   The term can refer to both a philosophical position concerning the [[sociology of knowledge]] and an official doctrine of public intellectual life in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Joravsky, D. and C. Koblernicz. "Party-Mindedness" ''Marxism and Communism in Western Society.'' Ed. C. D. Kering. New York: Herder and Herder, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by [[Vladimir Lenin]] in 1895, responding to [[Peter Struve]], to counter what he considered to be the futility of objectivity in political economic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Joravsky, D. and C. Koblernicz. "Party-Mindedness" ''Marxism and Communism in Western Society.'' Ed. C. D. Kering. New York: Herder and Herder, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;
Class interests and material conditions of existence determine ideology, and thus, in a Marxist-Leninist view, true objectivity (in terms of non-partisanship) is not possible in a society of antagonistic classes.&lt;ref&gt;Smirnov, G.L. Partiinost' Great Soviet Encyclopedia.  3rd Edition.  Eds. A. M. Prokhorov and M. Waxman.  New York: Macmillan, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marxists, in Lenin's view, should openly acknowledge their partisanship on the side of proletarian revolution.  [[Bourgeois]] emphasis on the normative goal of objectivity is thus considered to be delusional.  In this sense, ''partiinost''' is a universal and inevitable element of political and ideological life, but its presence is not always acknowledged, or is often flatly denied, by the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Smirnov, G.L. Partiinost' Great Soviet Encyclopedia.  3rd Edition.  Eds. A. M. Prokhorov and M. Waxman.  New York: Macmillan, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

Descriptively, ''partiinost''' was not a novel concept, and had been described in different words by [[Thrasymachus]], [[Xenophanes]], and [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;Joravsky, D. and C. Koblernicz. "Party-Mindedness" ''Marxism and Communism in Western Society.'' Ed. C. D. Kering. New York: Herder and Herder, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Lenin's term has a normative element that was not present in prior descriptions of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Joravsky, D. and C. Koblernicz. "Party-Mindedness" ''Marxism and Communism in Western Society.'' Ed. C. D. Kering. New York: Herder and Herder, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, Lenin insisted that partiinost' ''should'' be publicly expressed whenever possible.

A clear expression of ''partiinost''' can be found in its entry in the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Communist Party consistently upholds the principle of ''partiinost'''.  Defending and substantiating the goals and tasks of the working class and the policies of the Communist Party, Marxist-Leninist theory mercilessly criticizes the exploiters' system, its politics, and its ideology.  ... By contrast, the bourgeoisie, whose interests conflict with those of the majority, is forced to hide its self-seeking aspirations, to pretend that its economic and political aims are those of society as a whole, and to wrap itself in the toga of non-partisanship&lt;ref&gt;Smirnov, G.L. Partiinost' Great Soviet Encyclopedia.  3rd Edition.  Eds. A. M. Prokhorov and M. Waxman.  New York: Macmillan, 1973.  Vol. 19, Page 296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Partiinost''' is also used by Lenin in [[Materialism and Empirio-criticism]] to refer to the concept of philosophical factionalism, which he defined broadly as the struggle between idealists and materialists.&lt;ref&gt;Joravsky, D. and C. Koblernicz. "Party-Mindedness" ''Marxism and Communism in Western Society.'' Ed. C. D. Kering. New York: Herder and Herder, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is also commonly used in modern Russian to describe political affiliations.

In many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, the phrase "'''peace, order, and good government'''" is an expression used in law to express the legitimate objects of [[legislative power]]s conferred by [[statute]]. The phrase appears in many [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Imperial]] [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] and [[Letters Patent]], most notably the constitutions of [[Canada]], the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] and, formerly, [[New Zealand]] and South Africa. Contrast with "[[life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness]]", a spiritually-similar phrase found in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

==Background==
Legal documents often contain a residual clause which expresses which entity will have authority over jurisdictions that have not otherwise been delineated or are in dispute. While specific authorities are often enumerated in legal documents as well, the designation of a [[Reserved powers|residual power]] helps provide direction to future decision-makers and in emerging issue areas. At its origin, the preferred phrase was "peace, ''welfare'' and good government," but this eventually evolved into "peace, ''order'' and good government," which soon became part of the standard phraseology used in British Colonies to denote the residual power of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lithwick|first1=Dara|title=‘Welfare’ of a Nation: The Origins of ‘Peace, Order and Good Government’|url=https://hillnotes.ca/2017/04/26/welfare-of-a-nation-the-origins-of-peace-order-and-good-government/|website=The Library of Parliament (Canada)|publisher=The Parliament of Canada|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this phrase is used in the constitutional documents of several commonwealth countries, it has taken on a particular importance in the Canadian constitution due to repeated disputes about the natural of residual [[Canadian federalism|federal power in Canada]].

==Canada==
{{Politics of Canada}}

In Canada, "[[peace]], order and [[good government]]" (in French, '''''"paix, ordre et bon gouvernement"'''''), often abbreviated '''POGG''', is often used to describe the principles upon which that country's [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] took place. A similar phrase, "peace, welfare, and good government", had been used the [[Act of Union 1840]] that created the [[Province of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Union Act, 1840|url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/PreConfederation/ua_1840.html|website=Canadian Constitutional Documents: A Legal History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The now familiar phrase "peace, order and good government" was originally used in the British North America Act, 1867 (now known as the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]) enacted by the [[United Kingdom Parliament|Imperial Parliament]], and it defines the principles under which the [[Canadian Parliament]] should legislate. Specifically, the phrase appears in section 91 of the Act, which is part of the block of sections that divide legislative powers between the federal and [[provinces of Canada|provincial]] levels of government. POGG is a head of power arising from opening words of section 91 and is distinct from the enumerated powers under that section. The broad language suggests that there is a comprehensive grant of residual legislative authority to the federal government. Although the residual nature of the clause remains, the scope of the clause has been limited by the jurisprudence of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC). The JCPC narrowed the scope of the clause to the three distinct branches which remain while also broadly interpreting the scope of provincial authority over property and civil rights under section 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The jurisprudence has been defined into three branches: Emergency Branch, Gap or Purely Residual Branch, and National Concern Branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monahan|first=Patrick J.|title=Constitutional Law, Third Edition|year=2006|publisher=Irwin Law Inc.|location=Toronto|isbn=978-155221-128-1|pages=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation doctrines===
Although the text of the Act gives Parliament residuary powers to enact laws in any area that has not been allocated to the provincial governments, subsequent jurisprudence has limited the scope of the "peace, order, and good government" power. The limitation on the scope of this clause stems from the narrow interpretation of its branches and the expansive interpretation of provincial powers under section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Particularly limiting is the breadth of provincial power over property and civil rights under s. 92(13). Although the Emergency Branch and the National Concern Branch may be viewed as delimited federal competencies like the enumerated clauses under section 91 (see e.g. ''AG Canada v AG Ontario (Labour Conventions)'', [1937] AC 326 (PC)), the clause remains residuary. The powers under POGG must be interpreted in light of the subsequent jurisprudence on the limitations of the clause and the expansive powers of the provinces under their enumerated heads of power. If a matter does not fall within one of the enumerated classes in section 92, section 91, or the emergency or national concern branches, then it falls within the narrowly defined residual branch of POGG. The POGG power is best understood as a narrowly defined residual power limited to the following three branches.

====The Gap or Purely Residual Branch====
POGG's gap-filling power covers issues such as drafting oversights and matters not within the boundaries of a province. Drafting oversights include things the drafters of the Constitution forgot to think about but would unambiguously have allocated to Parliament if they had. For instance, section 92 allocates responsibility for provincially incorporated companies to the legislatures but section 91 says nothing about federally incorporated companies: the gap branch allocates this jurisdiction to Parliament, per ''John Deere Plow Co v Wharton'', 1915. Matters not within the boundaries of a particular province include Canadian territorial lands and waters that are within provincial boundaries such as the seabed off the coast of Newfoundland, per ''Reference Re Seabed and Subsoil of Continental Shelf Offshore Newfoundland'', [1984] 1 S.C.R. 86.

The gap branch is rarely relied on because there is so little left to default to the federal government after taking into account the enumerated provincial power over property and civil rights under section 92(13) which applies to any transaction, person or activity that is found within the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monahan|first=Patrick J.|title=Constitutional Law, Third Edition|year=2006|publisher=Irwin Law Inc.|location=Toronto|isbn=978-155221-128-1|pages=259–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically new subject matters, such as aeronautics, do not necessarily fall residually to the federal government, per ''[[Johannesson v West St Paul (Rural Municipality of)]]'', 1952.

====The Emergency Branch====
Parliament may invoke [[emergency powers]] under the emergency branch of POGG. This began in 1882, when the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] (then the supreme authority over [[Canadian law]]) ruled in ''[[Russell v. The Queen]]'' that the federal government could legislate with regard to alcohol, because even though this would probably have been considered provincial jurisdiction in ordinary circumstances, the federal government was acting to ensure order in Canada. This concept further evolved during the 1920s, when in the 1922 [[Board of Commerce case]], it was stated that POGG could be invoked in times of war and [[famine]], to allow Parliament to intervene in matters of provincial jurisdiction. POGG was later used this way in the ''[[Anti-Inflation Reference]]'' of 1976, when the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] allowed Parliament to regulate inflation on the grounds that it posed a considerable economic problem for Canada. In that case, a great degree of deference was exercised in accepting what the federal government deemed to be an emergency.

====The National Concern Branch====
The "national concern" doctrine (sometimes referred to as "national dimensions") was an alternate means of applying the POGG powers that found use in the mid 20th century. It allowed Parliament to legislate on matters that would normally fall to the provincial government when the issue became of such importance that it concerned the entire country. 

The doctrine originated from a statement by Lord Watson in the [[Local Prohibition case]] (1896), wherein he stated:
:''Their Lordships do not doubt that some matters, in their origin local and provincial, might attain such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion, and to justify the Canadian Parliament in passing laws for their regulation or abolition in the interest of the Dominion.''
After this case the doctrine was completely ignored until 1946 when Viscount Simons brought it back in the case of ''[[Ontario v. Canada Temperance Foundation]]'', [1946] A.C. 193 (P.C.). The test as stated in ''Temperance Foundation'' was whether the matter "goes beyond local or provincial concern or interests and must from its inherent nature be the concern of the Dominion as a whole".&lt;ref&gt;p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

====Current approach to interpretation====

The above branches of the power are currently governed by the principles stated by [[Gerald Le Dain|Le Dain J.]] in ''[[R. v. Crown Zellerbach Canada Ltd.]]'':&lt;ref&gt;''[[R. v. Crown Zellerbach Canada Ltd.|Crown Zellerbach]]'', paragraph 33&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|
The national concern doctrine is separate and distinct from the national emergency doctrine of the peace, order and good government power, which is chiefly distinguishable by the fact that it provides a constitutional basis for what is necessarily legislation of a temporary nature;

The national concern doctrine applies to both new matters which did not exist at Confederation and to matters which, although originally matters of a local or private nature in a province, have since, in the absence of national emergency, become matters of national concern;

For a matter to qualify as a matter of national concern in either sense it must have a singleness, distinctiveness and indivisibility that clearly distinguishes it from matters of provincial concern and a scale of impact on provincial jurisdiction that is reconcilable with the fundamental distribution of legislative power under the Constitution;

In determining whether a matter has attained the required degree of singleness, distinctiveness and indivisibility that clearly distinguishes it from matters of provincial concern it is relevant to consider what would be the effect on extra‑provincial interests of a provincial failure to deal effectively with the control or regulation of the intra‑provincial aspects of the matter.

===Sociological value===
Despite its technical purpose, the phrase “peace, order and good government” has also become meaningful to Canadians. This [[tripartite motto]] is sometimes said to define Canadian values in a way comparable to “[[liberté, égalité, fraternité]]” (liberty, equality, fraternity) in France or “[[life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness]]” in the United States. Indeed, peace, order and good government has been used by some scholars to make broad characterisations of Canada's political culture. US [[sociologist]] [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], for example, contrasted POGG with the American tripartite motto to conclude Canadians generally believe in a higher degree of deference to the law.&lt;ref&gt;Dyck, Rand. ''Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches''. Third ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Nelson Thomson Learning, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; As Canadian historian Donald Creighton argued in his report to the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations,&lt;ref&gt;D.G Creighton, British North America at Confederation: a Study Prepared for the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations (Ottawa, Queen's Printer 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; the expression was used interchangeably in the 19th century by Canadian and Imperial officials with the expression ''peace, welfare and good government''.  The term ''welfare'' referred not to its more narrow modern echoes, but to the protection of the common wealth, the general public good.  ''Good government'' referred to good public administration, on the one hand, but also had echoes of what we now talk of as good governance, which incorporates the notion of appropriate self-governance by civil society actors, since one element of good government was thought to be its limitation to its appropriate sphere of responsibility.

==Elsewhere in the Commonwealth==

The phrase "peace, order and good government" appears in many 19th and 20th century British Acts of Parliament, such as the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]], the [[Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865]], the [[British Settlements Act 1887]], the [[Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900]], the [[South Africa Act 1909]], and the [[West Indies Act 1962]] and the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. 

In ''Ibrelebbe v. The Queen'' [1964] AC 900, 923, the words "peace, order and good government" contained in the [[Ceylon]] Constitution Order-in-Council (1946) were said by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] to 

:"connote, in British constitutional language, the widest law-making powers appropriate to a sovereign".

However, those powers are not unlimited. In ''The Trustees Executors and Agency Co. Ltd v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation'' (1933) 49 CLR 220, Justice [[H. V. Evatt|Evatt]] of the [[High Court of Australia]] wrote a separate judgement analyzing the power to make laws for the "peace, order and good government of New Zealand" under the New Zealand Constitution. His Honour held that laws dealing only with circumstances, persons or things outside of New Zealand, while not ''prima facie'' invalid could, in some cases, fail to satisfy the description of being for the peace, order and good government ''of New Zealand''. A law that failed to satisfy that description would be beyond legislative power and invalid, but Evatt J noted that cases of this kind would be "very rare". 

Recently, in ''R. v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Bancoult'' [2000] EWHC 413, the [[High Court of England and Wales]] struck down an ordinance made in 1971 by the Commissioner of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] expelling the entire population of the [[Chagos Archipelago]] to make way for an American military base at [[Diego Garcia]], purportedly under his power to legislate for the "peace, order and good government" of the territory. [[Lord Justice Laws]], ordering the British Government to allow the inhabitants to return to their former homes, condemned the depopulation of the islands in the name of "peace, order and good government" with the words:

:"It was [[Tacitus]] who said: They make a desert and call it peace – ''Solitudinem faciunt pacem appellant'' (Agricola 30). He meant it as an irony; but here, it was an abject legal failure."

{{Politics of Yugoslavia}}

The '''Presidency of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia''' ({{lang-sr|Predsedništvo SFRJ}}, Председништво СФРЈ; {{lang-hr|Predsjedništvo SFRJ}}; [[Slovenian language|Slovene]]: ''Predsedstvo SFRJ''; {{lang-mk|Председателство на СФРЈ}}), also known as the '''Presidium''', was the [[collective leadership|collective]] [[head of state]] of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. It was established in 1971 according to amendments to the [[1963 Yugoslav Constitution|1963 Constitution]] and reorganized by the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 Constitution]]. Up to 1974, the [[Presidency]] had 23 members – three from each [[republic]], two from each [[autonomous province]] and [[President of Yugoslavia|President]] [[Josip Broz Tito]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/87-1-268.shtml Slobodan Stankovic (1984): Yugoslavia's New State Presidency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817084209/http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/87-1-268.shtml |date=2011-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 the Presidency was reduced to 9 members – one from each republic and autonomous province and, until 1988, [[President of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] ''ex officio''.

==Constitutional powers==

According to the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 Constitution]], the Presidency had following powers:&lt;ref&gt;[http://sr.wikisource.org/sr-el/%D0%A3%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2_%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B5_%D0%A4%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B5_%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B5_%D0%88%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B5_%281974%29#.D0.9F.D0.A0.D0.95.D0.94.D0.A1.D0.95.D0.94.D0.9D.D0.98.D0.A8.D0.A2.D0.92.D0.9E_.D0.A1.D0.9E.D0.A6.D0.98.D0.88.D0.90.D0.9B.D0.98.D0.A1.D0.A2.D0.98.D0.A7.D0.9A.D0.95_.D0.A4.D0.95.D0.94.D0.95.D0.A0.D0.90.D0.A2.D0.98.D0.92.D0.9D.D0.95_.D0.A0.D0.95.D0.9F.D0.A3.D0.91.D0.9B.D0.98.D0.9A.D0.95_.D0.88.D0.A3.D0.93.D0.9E.D0.A1.D0.9B.D0.90.D0.92.D0.98.D0.88.D0.95 Constitution of the SFRY, 1974 (in Serbian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Presidency had eight members elected by parliaments of each republic and autonomous province and proclaimed by the [[Federal Assembly of the SFRY]], the ninth member was president of the Presidium of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. This ex officio membership of the LCY leader was abolished by the constitutional changes in autumn 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sr.wikisource.org/sr-el/%D0%90%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%A3%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2_%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B5_%D0%A4%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B5_%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B5_%D0%88%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B5_%281988%29#.D0.90.D0.9C.D0.90.D0.9D.D0.94.D0.9C.D0.90.D0.9D_-.7B.D0.A5LI.7D- Amendments to the Constitution of the SFRY, 1988 (in Serbian)]&lt;/ref&gt; The mandate of the Presidency lasted five years so the nine-member Presidency was elected in total four times - in 1974, 1979, 1984 and 1989.

Until 1980 most of powers of the Presidency (and control over the country in general) were in fact exercised by Josip Broz Tito, who was president of the republic for life. After his death in May 1980, his office stayed vacant and the Presidency began to function according to the constitution.

Sometimes, the Presidency held its sessions in an extended composition. Besides the members of the actual Presidency, in such sessions took part following officials: chairman of the Federal Assembly, chairman and vice-chairman of the Federal Executive Council (the government), federal secretaries (ministers) of defense, interior and foreign affairs, chairman of the Federal Conference of the [[Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia]] and chairmen of the Presidencies of the Yugoslav republics and autonomous provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europamagazine.info/feljtonoktobar.htm Interview with Raif Dizdarević (in Serbo-Croatian)]&lt;/ref&gt; The extended Presidency wasn't grounded in the Constitution and couldn't itself adopt any decisions.

==Post-Tito period==
Tito, as a president of the republic, was ex officio chairman of the Presidency. After his death a new chairman of the Presidency was elected every year. The order of rotating of the members on the leading position was agreed in advance, so this annual election was a pure formality. The rotating system jammed only in May 1991 - [[Stipe Mesić]], representative of [[Franjo Tuđman]]'s new Croatian government in the Presidency, was about to become the chairman but wasn't elected due to opposition of a half of the Presidency controlled by Serbian leader [[Slobodan Milošević]]. The top state office of the disintegrating federation remained vacant until 1 July when Mesić was finally elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moljac.hr/biografije/mesic.htm Biography of Stipe Mesić (in Croatian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717021940/http://www.moljac.hr/biografije/mesic.htm |date=2012-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="www2.slobodnaevropa.org"&gt;[http://www2.slobodnaevropa.org/svjedoci/html/Vasil_Tupurkovski.html Interview with Vasil Tupurkovski, Radio Free Europe (in Serbo-Croatian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204205120/http://www2.slobodnaevropa.org/svjedoci/html/Vasil_Tupurkovski.html |date=2008-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one year after Tito's death, Yugoslav leaders had to face [[1981 protests in Kosovo|violent riots]] in [[Kosovo]]. On 2 April 1981 the Presidency under chairmanship of [[Cvijetin Mijatović]] declared a [[state of emergency]] in [[Priština]] and [[Kosovska Mitrovica]], which lasted one week.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/85-4-101.shtml |date=* |title=Slobodan Stankovic (1982): Kosovo: One year after the riots }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www2.slobodnaevropa.org_2"&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www2.slobodnaevropa.org/svjedoci/html/Raif_Dizdarevic.html |date=* |title=Interview with Raif Dizdarević }}, Radio Free Europe (in Serbo-Croatian)&lt;/ref&gt; The Presidency declared the state of emergency again, that time on the whole territory of Kosovo, on 27 February 1989 under chairmanship of [[Raif Dizdarević]], when [[1989 Kosovo miners' strike|even more serious disorders]] in Kosovo broke out.&lt;ref name="www2.slobodnaevropa.org_2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080407105427/http://www.deutsche-aussenpolitik.de/index.php?%2Fresources%2Fdossiers%2Fkosovo_timetable.php Timetable of the conflicts in Kosovo]&lt;/ref&gt; For the third time in post-Tito Yugoslavia, the state of emergency in Kosovo was imposed by the Presidency in February 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/28946 Chronology of Yugoslavia's break-up (in Croatian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521132903/http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/28946 |date=2011-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of the last Presidency elected in May 1989 reflected both approach of political pluralism in some parts of the federation and the beginning of agony in Yugoslavia:
* [[Janez Drnovšek]] from [[Slovenia]] and [[Bogić Bogićević]] from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] were elected in direct elections held in their republics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.slobodnaevropa.org/svjedoci/html/Bogic_Bogicevic.html Interview with Bogić Bogićević, Radio Free Europe (in Serbo-Croatian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204221012/http://www2.slobodnaevropa.org/svjedoci/html/Bogic_Bogicevic.html |date=2008-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Janez Drnovšek#Membership in the Yugoslav presidency|Janez Drnovšek on the English Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* representatives of  [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], Kosovo and [[Vojvodina]], i.e. half of the Presidency, were acting under ''de facto'' control of Slobodan Milošević&lt;ref name="www2.slobodnaevropa.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.slobodnaevropa.org/svjedoci/html/Stjepan_Mesic.html Interview with Stipe Mesić, Radio Free Europe (in Serbo-Croatian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205002735/http://www2.slobodnaevropa.org/svjedoci/html/Stjepan_Mesic.html |date=2008-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stipe Šuvar]], Croat representative of strongly pro-Yugoslav opinions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article462339.ece Stipe Suvar obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; was in October 1990 replaced by Stipe Mesić nominated by Croatian government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.slobodnaevropa.org/svjedoci/html/Stipe_Suvar.html Interview with Stipe Šuvar, Radio Free Europe (in Serbo-Croatian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205000031/http://www2.slobodnaevropa.org/svjedoci/html/Stipe_Suvar.html |date=2008-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In summer 1991 Mesić and Drnovšek, regarding their republics independent, ceased to attend sessions of the Presidency. They were followed by Bogićević and [[Vasil Tupurkovski]] from [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], so that the Presidency de facto ceased to exist, although the members from Serbia, her provinces (Kosovo and Vojvodina) and Montenegro continued to hold sessions until 1992.&lt;ref name="www2.slobodnaevropa.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11212">This page lists the results of '''[[leadership convention|leadership elections]]''' held by the '''[[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta]]''' or as it was known before 1958, the Conservatives.

==1905 leadership convention==

(Held on August 16, 1905)

*'''[[R.B. Bennett]]''' acclaimed

==Developments 1905-1923==

Bennett was defeated in the [[Alberta general election, 1905|1905 general election]] and Albert Robertson was chosen House leader. Robertson in turn was defeated in the [[Alberta general election, 1909|1909 general election]]. Afterwards, Bennett, who had been elected, became House leader. Bennett resigned in 1910 and [[Edward Michener]] became House leader on July 5. Michener resigned after the [[Alberta general election, 1917|1917 general election]] when he was appointed to the Senate. [[George Hoadley (Alberta politician)|George Hoadley]] was chosen House leader on February 8, 1918. He was removed on February 18, 1920 in favour of [[James Ramsey (politician)|James Ramsey]]. Ramsey was in turn ousted in 1921 in favour of [[Albert Ewing]] and the Conservative caucus was split. After the Conservative Party's disastrous performance in the  [[Alberta general election, 1921|1921 general election]] the only Conservative left in the legislature was the independent [[John Smith Stewart]].

===Second ballot===
[[File:Alberta 2011 PC Leadership 2.png|thumb|The leading candidate in each riding on the second ballot.]]
A [[preferential ballot]] was cast on October 1, 2011. Because no candidate received more than 50% of the vote on the first count, the third-place finisher was dropped, and the second preference votes cast on Horner's ballots were counted and added to the remaining candidate's totals. Mar led after the first round, and Horner was eliminated. After second preferences were applied, Redford was declared the winner.

{{Other uses|Rector (disambiguation){{!}}Rector}}

'''Rectors and rectorates''' in politics and administration included:

== Roman ==
'''''Rector provinciae''''' was a Latin generic term for [[Roman governor]], the governor of a [[Roman province]], known after the time of [[Suetonius]], and specifically a legal term (as used in the Codices of the Emperors [[Theodosius I]] and [[Justinian I]]) after Emperor Diocletian's [[Tetrarchy]] (when they came under the administrative authority of the [[Vicarius]] of a diocese and these under a Pretorian prefect), regardless of what their specific titles (of different rank, such as [[Consularis]], [[Corrector provinciae]], [[Praeses]] and [[Proconsul]]) may have been.

== Ragusa ==
 {{main|Rector (Ragusa)}}
A similar gubernatorial use or as [[Chief magistrate]] existed in the [[Republic of Ragusa]] (presently Dubrovnik, Croatia), which was governed by a Rector (also used in the Italian form ''Rettore'' and the Slavonic equivalent [[Knez (title)|Knez]]):
* 1358–1808, during the independence of the Ragusan Republic and two years after it was occupied by Napoleonic France in 1806.
* one more Rector, from 18–29 January 1814, was Count Sabo Đurđević (Savino de Giorgi), the last previous incumbent, during the short-lived liberation of the Republic, before the occupation by Austrian troops.

The seat of the rector was the [[Rector's Palace, Dubrovnik]].

== Fiume ==
'''''Primo Rettore''''', from 8 September 1920 to 29 December 1920, was the title of [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] when he created the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]]

== Other ==
*For the use of the style ''duke and rector of Burgundy'' by the Zähringer dynasty claimants to viceregal powers as Regent in the [[Kingdom of Arles|Arelat Kingdom]] of Burgundy ''within'' the Holy Roman Empire, see [[King of Burgundy#Rectorate of Burgundy]]
*Contemporary charters in Latin used a number of additional styles for the Danish king Cnut (Canute the Great, with Norway as his third realm; 23 April 1016 - 12 November 1035 in Britain) having ''rex Anglorum'' in the core plus various other titles, including ''rex Anglorum totiusque Brittannice orbis gubernator et rector'' i.e., 'king of the Angli and of all Britain governor and rector' (the last two in the generic sense 'ruler')
* In an early 12th-century [[oath]] to [[Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona]], this ruler is referred to as ''rector catalanicus'' (as well as  ''catalanicus heroes'' and ''dux catalanensis'').
*The [[Comtat Venaissin]] in southern France was administered by a rector since it became a papal possession until 1790 (on 24 May its States-General (representative assembly) proclaimed a constitution, but remained loyal to the pope).

The '''right of asylum''' (sometimes called '''right of political asylum''', from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ἄσυλον)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/asylum |title=Asylum – Definition |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=asylum (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=asylum|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an ancient juridical concept, under which a person [[persecution|persecuted]] by one's own country may be protected by another [[sovereignty|sovereign authority]], such as another country or [[sanctuary|church official]], who in medieval times could offer sanctuary. This right was already recognized by the [[Ancient Egyptians|Egyptians]], the [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]], and the [[Hebrews]], from whom it was adopted into [[Western world|Western]] [[tradition]]. [[René Descartes]] fled to the [[Netherlands]], [[Voltaire]] to [[England]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]] to [[France]], because each state offered protection to persecuted foreigners.

The Egyptians, Greeks, and Hebrews recognized a religious "right of asylum", protecting criminals (or those accused of crime) from legal action to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 35:25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joshua 20&lt;/ref&gt; This principle was later adopted by the established Christian church, and various rules were developed that detailed how to qualify for protection and what degree of protection one would receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13430a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Sanctuary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Council of Orléans|Council of Orleans]] decided in 511, in the presence of [[Clovis I]], that asylum could be granted to anyone who took refuge in a church or on church property, or at the home of a bishop. This protection was extended to [[murder]]ers, [[thief|thieves]] and [[adultery|adulterers]] alike.

That "Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution" is enshrined in the [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] of 1948 and supported by the 1951 [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] and the 1967 [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html|title=Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under these agreements, a [[refugee]] is a person who is outside that person's own country's territory owing to fear of persecution on protected grounds, including race, caste, nationality, religion, political opinions and participation in any particular social group or social activities.

==Medieval England ==
{{Refimprove|date=December 2012}}
In England, King [[Æthelberht of Kent]] proclaimed the first [[Anglo-Saxon laws]] on [[sanctuary]] in about 600 AD. However [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (c. 1136) says that the legendary pre-Saxon king [[Dunvallo Molmutius]] (4th/5th century BC) enacted sanctuary laws among the [[Molmutine Laws]] as recorded by [[Gildas]] (c. 500–570).&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' 2, 17&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[wiktionary:grith|grith]]'' was used by the laws of king ''[[Æthelred the Unready|Ethelred]]''.
By the [[Norman era]] that followed 1066, two kinds of sanctuary had evolved: all churches had the lower-level powers and could grant sanctuary within the church proper, but the broader powers of churches licensed by royal [[charter]] extended sanctuary to a zone around the church. At least twenty-two churches had charters for this broader sanctuary, including

* [[Battle Abbey]]
* [[Beverley]] (see image, right)
* [[Colchester]]
* [[Durham, England]]
* [[Hexham]]
* [[Norwich]]
* [[Ripon]]
* [[Wells Cathedral]]
* [[Winchester Cathedral]]
* [[Westminster Abbey]]
* [[York Minster]]

Sometimes the criminal had to get to the chapel itself to be protected, or ring a certain bell, hold a certain ring or [[Sanctuary knocker|door-knocker]], or sit on a certain chair ("[[frith]]-stool"). Some of these items survive at various churches. Elsewhere, sanctuary held in an area around the church or abbey, sometimes extending in radius to as much as a mile and a half. Stone "sanctuary crosses" marked the boundaries of the area; some crosses still exist as well. Thus it could become a race between the felon and the medieval law officers to the nearest sanctuary boundary. Serving of justice upon the fleet of foot could prove a difficult proposition.

Church sanctuaries were regulated by common law. An asylum seeker had to confess his sins, surrender his weapons, and permit supervision by a church or abbey organization with jurisdiction. Seekers then had forty days to decide whether to surrender to secular authorities and stand trial for their alleged crimes, or to confess their guilt, [[abjuration#Abjuration of the realm|abjure the realm]], and go into [[exile]] by the shortest route and never return without the king's permission. Those who did return faced execution under the law and/or [[excommunicated|excommunication]] from the Church.

If the suspects chose to confess their guilt and abjure, they did so in a public ceremony, usually at the church gates. They would surrender their possessions to the church, and any [[landed property]] to the crown. The coroner, a medieval official, would then choose a port city from which the fugitive should leave England (though the fugitive sometimes had this privilege). The fugitive would set out barefooted and bareheaded, carrying a wooden cross-staff as a symbol of protection under the church. Theoretically they would stay to the main highway, reach the port and take the first ship out of England. In practice, however, the fugitive could get a safe distance away, abandon the cross-staff and take off and start a new life. However, one can safely assume the friends and relatives of the victim knew of this ploy and would do everything in their power to make sure this did not happen; or indeed that the fugitives never reached their intended port of call, becoming victims of [[vigilante]] justice under the pretense of a fugitive who wandered too far off the main highway while trying to "escape."

Knowing the grim options, some fugitives rejected both choices and opted for an escape from the asylum before the forty days were up. Others simply made no choice and did nothing. Since it was illegal for the victim's friends to break into an asylum, the church would deprive the fugitive of food and water until a decision was made.

[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] changed the rules of asylum, reducing to a short list the types of crimes for which people were allowed to claim asylum. The medieval system of asylum was finally abolished entirely by [[James I of England|James I]] in 1623.

During the [[Wars of the Roses]], when the Yorkists or Lancastrians would suddenly get the upper hand by winning a battle, some adherents of the losing side might find themselves surrounded by adherents of the other side and not able to get back to their own side. Upon realizing this situation they would rush to sanctuary at the nearest church until it was safe to come out. A prime example is Queen [[Elizabeth Woodville]], consort of [[Edward IV of England]].

In 1470, when the Lancastrians briefly restored [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] to the throne, Queen [[Elizabeth Woodville|Elizabeth]] was living in London with several young daughters. She moved with them into [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] for sanctuary, living there in royal comfort until [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] was restored to the throne in 1471 and giving birth to their first son [[Edward V of England|Edward V]] during that time. When King Edward IV died in 1483, Elizabeth (who was highly unpopular with even the Yorkists and probably did need protection) took her five daughters and youngest son (Richard, Duke of York) and again moved into sanctuary at Westminster. To be sure she had all the comforts of home, she brought so much furniture and so many chests that the workmen had to knock holes in some of the walls to get everything in fast enough to suit her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N3ELAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq ''Historical Memorials of Westminster Abbey''] by Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern political asylum==
{{Refimprove|date=February 2010}}
Article 14 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that "Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution." The [[United Nations]] 1951 [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] and the 1967 [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees]] guides national legislation concerning political asylum. Under these agreements, a [[refugee]] (or for cases where repressing base means has been applied directly or environmentally to the refugee) is a person who is outside that person's own country's territory (or place of habitual residence if [[stateless person|stateless]]) owing to fear of [[persecution]] on protected grounds. Protected grounds include [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[caste]], [[nationality]], [[religion]], [[political opinions]] and membership and/or participation in any particular [[social group]] or social activities. Rendering true victims of persecution to their persecutor is a violation of a principle called [[non-refoulement]], part of the [[customary international law|customary]] and [[treaty law|trucial]] [[public international law|Law of Nations]].

These are the accepted terms and criteria as principles and a fundamental part in the 1951 [[United Nations]] [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] [[non-refoulement]] order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]], Article 33 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, victims of sexual persecution (which may include domestic violence, or systematic oppression of a gender or sexual minority) have come to be accepted in some countries as a legitimate category for asylum claims, when claimants can prove that the state is unable or unwilling to provide protection.

====European Union====
{{see also|Asylum in the European Union}}
Asylum in [[European Union]] Member States formed over a half-century by application of the [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 on the Status of Refugees]]. Common policies appeared in the 1990s in connection with the [[Schengen Agreement]] (which suppressed internal borders) so that asylum seekers unsuccessful in one Member State would not reapply in another. The common policy began with the [[Dublin Convention]] in 1990. It continued with the implementation of [[Eurodac]] and the [[Dublin Regulation]] in 2003, and the October 2009 adoption of two proposals by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/09/1552&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=FR&amp;guiLanguage=en A single asylum procedure and equitable to establish a uniform status valid throughout the European Union: the final building blocks of international protection are asked], Brussels, October 21, 2009 (press release Europa.eu)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====France=====
France was the first country to recognize the constitutional right to asylum, this being enshrined in article 120 of the [[French Constitution of 1793|Constitution of 1793]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Prof. Vincent Chetail |url=http://rsq.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/3/16.full.pdf |title=Helène Lambert, Francesco Messineo, and Paul Tiedemann, COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF CONSTITUTIONAL ASYLUM IN FRANCE, ITALY, AND GERMANY: REQUIESCAT IN PACE?, Refugee Survey Quarterly, Vol. 27, No. 3 |journal=Refugee Survey Quarterly |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=16–32 |date=2008-09-16 |accessdate=2013-07-10|doi=10.1093/rsq/hdn043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The modern French right of asylum is recognized by the [[French Fifth Republic|1958 Constitution]], ''vis-à-vis'' the paragraph 4 of the preamble to the [[French Fourth Republic|Constitution of 1946]], to which the Preamble of the 1958 Constitution directly refers.  The Constitution of 1946 incorporated of parts of the 1793 constitution which had guaranteed the right of asylum to "anyone persecuted because of his action for freedom" who are unable to seek protection in their home countries.

In addition to the constitutional right to asylum, the modern French right to asylum (''droit d'asile'') is enshrined on a legal and regulatory basis in the ''Code de l'Entree et du Sejour des Etrangers et du Droit d'Asile''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070158 |title=Code de l'entrée et du séjour des étrangers et du droit d'asile. |language=fr |publisher=Legifrance |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CESEDA).

France also adheres to international agreements which provide for application modalities for the right of asylum, such as the 1951 [[United Nations]] (UN) [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] (ratified in 1952), the additional 1967 protocol; articles K1 and K2 of the 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]] as well as the 1985 [[Schengen Agreement]], which defined EU [[immigration policy]]. Finally, the right of asylum is defined by article 18 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]].

Some of the criteria for which an asylum application can be rejected include: i) Passage via “safe" third country, ii) Safe Country of Origin (An asylum seeker can be a prior refused asylum if he or she is a national of a country considered to be "safe" by the French asylum authority OFPRA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Authority delegated to OFPRA by art. L. 722-1 of Code de l'entrée et du séjour des étrangers et du droit d'asile, J.O., 4 December 2009 |url=
http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/./affichCode.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006335238&amp;idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006147782&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070158&amp;dateTexte=20080807 |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; iii) Safety Threat (serious threat to the public order), or iv) Fraudulent Application (abuse of the asylum procedure for other reasons).

The December 10, 2003, law limited political asylum through two main restrictions:
*The notion of "internal asylum": the request may be rejected if the foreigner may benefit from political asylum on a portion of the territory of their home country.
*The [[OFPRA]] (''Office français de protection des réfugiés et apatrides'' – French Office for the Protection of Refugees and [[Stateless Persons]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofpra.gouv.fr/|title=ofpra.gouv.fr|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; now makes a list of allegedly "safe countries" which respect [[political rights]] and principles of [[liberty]]. If the demander of asylum comes from such a country, the request is processed in 15 days, and receives no [[social assistance]] protection. They may contest the decision, but this does not suspend any [[deportation]] order. The first list, enacted in July 2005, included as "safe countries" [[Benin]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Ghana]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritius|Mauritius Island]], [[India]], [[Senegal]], [[Mongolia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Croatia]]. It had the effect of reducing in six months by about 80% the number of applicants from these countries. The second list, passed in July 2006, included [[Tanzania]], [[Madagascar]], [[Niger]], [[Albania]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/france/20060427.FIG000000128_asile_politique_la_france_ajoute_cinq_etats_a_sa_liste_de_pays_srs.html Asile politique: la France ajoute cinq Etats à sa liste de pays «sûrs»], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', April 27, 2006 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While restricted, the right of political asylum has been conserved in France amid various anti-immigration laws. Some people claim that, apart from the purely judicial path, the [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] process is used to slow down and ultimately reject what might be considered as valid requests. According to ''[[Le Figaro]]'', France granted 7,000 people the status of political refugee in 2006, out of a total of 35,000 requests; in 2005, the OFPRA in charge of examining the legitimacy of such requests granted less than 10,000 from a total of 50,000 requests.&lt;ref&gt;"La porte étroite de l'asile politique", ''[[Le Figaro]]'', February 13, 2007, p.20 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous exiles from South American dictatorships, particularly from [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s [[Chile]] and the [[Dirty War]] in [[Argentina]], were received in the 1970s-80s.
Since the 2001 [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]], tens of [[homeless]] [[Afghan refugees|Afghan asylum seekers]] have been sleeping in a park in [[Paris]] near the ''[[Gare de l'Est]]'' train station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schuster|first=Liza|title=The park near the Gare de l'Est: 'Just waiting to go, to move on'|journal=Translocations: Migration and Social Change|date=Winter 2010|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.translocations.ie/docs/v06i02/Vol%206%20Issue%202%20-%20Europe%20-%20Schuster.pdf|accessdate=29 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025250/http://www.translocations.ie/docs/v06i02/Vol%206%20Issue%202%20-%20Europe%20-%20Schuster.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although their demands haven't been yet accepted, their presence has been tolerated. However, since the end of 2005, [[NGO]]s have been noting that the [[French police|police]] separate Afghans from other migrants during raids, and expel via [[charter airlines|charters]] those who have just arrived at ''Gare de l'Est'' by train and haven't had time to demand asylum (a May 30, 2005, decree requires them to pay for a translator to help with official formalities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pajol.eu.org/article896.html |title=PAJOL &amp;#124; Expulsion collective des afghans : non à l'arbitraire et à l'illégalité ! |publisher=Pajol.eu.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United Kingdom=====
{{further|Asylum and Immigration Tribunal}}

In the 19th century, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] accorded political asylum to various persecuted people, among whom were many members of the [[socialist]] movement (including [[Karl Marx]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=u7HSJ90M2isC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=In+the+19th+century,+the+United+Kingdom+accorded+political+asylum+to+various+persecuted+people,+among+whom+were+many+members+of+the+socialist+movement+(including+Karl+Marx)#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Revolutionary Refugees: German Socialism in Britain, 1840-1860|last=Lattek|first=Christine|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780714651002|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the 1845 attempted [[bombing]] of the [[Greenwich Royal Observatory]]{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} and the 1911 [[Siege of Sidney Street]] in the context of the [[propaganda of the deed]] ([[anarchism|anarchist]]) actions, political asylum was restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a7UwAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=political+asylum+restricted+in+britain+in+1911+Siege+of+Sidney+Street&amp;dq=political+asylum+restricted+in+britain+in+1911+Siege+of+Sidney+Street|title=Jewish London: an illustrated history|last=Black|first=Gerry|date=2003-10-13|publisher=Breedon|isbn=9781859833636|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Refimprove|date=August 2013}}
{{Main|Asylum in the United States}}
The [[United States]] recognizes the right of asylum of individuals as specified by international and federal law. A specified number of [[refugee law|legally defined]] [[refugee]]s who apply for refugee status overseas, as well as those applying for asylum after arriving in the U.S., are admitted annually.

As noted in the article specifically about [[Asylum in the United States|asylum and refugees in the United States]], since World War II, more refugees have found homes in the U.S. than any other nation and more than two million refugees have arrived in the U.S. since 1980. During much of the 1990s, the United States accepted over 100,000 refugees per year, though this figure has recently decreased to around 50,000 per year in the first decade of the 21st century, due to greater security concerns. As for asylum seekers, the latest statistics show that 86,400 persons sought sanctuary in the United States in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/imm_asy_see-immigration-asylum-seekers |title=Asylum Seekers (most recent) by country |publisher=Nationmaster.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[September 11 attacks]] individual asylum applicants were evaluated in private proceedings at the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS)]].

Despite this, concerns have been raised with the U.S. asylum and refugee determination processes. A recent empirical analysis by three legal scholars described the U.S. asylum process as a game of [[refugee roulette]]; that is to say that the outcome of asylum determinations depends in large part on the personality of the particular adjudicator to whom an application is randomly assigned, rather than on the merits of the case. The very low numbers of Iraqi refugees accepted between 2003 and 2007 exemplifies concerns about the United States' refugee processes. The Foreign Policy Association reported that "Perhaps the most perplexing component of the Iraq refugee crisis... has been the inability for the U.S. to absorb more Iraqis following the 2003 invasion of the country. To date, the U.S. has granted less than 800 Iraqis refugee status, just 133 in 2007. By contrast, the U.S. granted asylum to more than 100,000 Vietnamese refugees during the Vietnam War." &lt;ref&gt;"Global Views: Iraq's refugees, by R. Nolan, Foreign Policy Association Features, Resource Library, June 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5693">[[File:Neil Kinnock (1989).jpg|thumb|[[Neil Kinnock]], whose performance at the rally was widely panned]]
The '''Sheffield Rally''' was a political event held by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] on Wednesday 1 April 1992, a week ahead of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 UK general election]] on 9 April.

==The event==
An event in preparation for eighteen months,&lt;ref name="BBC97"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/92keyiss.shtml "Key Issues in the 1992 Campaign"], BBC News, Politics '97&lt;/ref&gt; the rally was held at the [[Motorpoint Arena Sheffield|Sheffield Arena]], an indoor sports venue in [[Sheffield]], England. It was attended by 10,000 Labour Party members, including the entire [[Shadow Cabinet of Neil Kinnock|shadow cabinet]], and is reported to have cost some £100,000 to stage.&lt;ref name="BBC97"/&gt; It was the idea of strategist [[Philip Gould, Baron Gould of Brookwood|Philip Gould]],&lt;ref name="telegraph2011"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/8874053/Lord-Gould-of-Brookwood.html Obituary: "Lord Gould of Brookwood"], telegraph.co.uk, 7 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; who was involved in the subsequent successful election campaign of [[Bill Clinton]] later that year.&lt;ref name="telegraph2011"/&gt; The party leader, [[Neil Kinnock]], was flown into the city by [[helicopter]].&lt;ref name="Barnard"&gt;Stephanie Barnard [http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/sheffield/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8170000/8170344.stm "Kinnock came and didn't conquer"], BBC News Sheffield &amp; South Yorkshire, 27 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The rally was modelled partly on American presidential campaign conventions, with sound and light performances on the stage and celebrity endorsements played on a large video screen. At one point in the proceedings, Kinnock and the shadow cabinet paraded to the stage from the back of the venue, passing through an increasingly enthusiastic audience, with the shadow cabinet being introduced with titles such as "The next Home Secretary" and "The next Prime Minister"; Labour had been in opposition for 13 years and had already lost three consecutive general elections to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]].

This culminated in an emotional and animated Kinnock taking the podium and repeatedly shouting "We're all right!", which has often been re-broadcast since as an example of overconfident campaigning. Kinnock followed this by proclaiming "We'd better get some talking done here, serious talking."&lt;ref name="Barnard"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Although Labour's internal polls at the time suggested the event had little effect on the level of support for the party, media commentators, and some prominent Labour politicians, thought the rally came over as "triumphalist" to television viewers of subsequent news programmes.&lt;ref name="BBC97"/&gt;

The election eight days later was a victory for the Conservatives, who finished 8% ahead of Labour in voting, but with a much smaller parliamentary majority than [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|in 1987]]. It is widely regarded as one of the most surprising election results of the 20th century, as pollsters had predicted a narrow Labour majority or a [[hung parliament]].

Mirroring Labour's poll results, several analysts and major participants in the campaign believe it actually had little effect. Jim Parish, Senior Campaigns Officer for the Labour Party from 1985 to 1993 and an organiser of the rally, wrote: "The catastrophic 6–7 per cent drop in Labour support occurred before the rally and was – I am reliably informed – known in Sheffield that night."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Parish |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/199901010027 |title=It was tax what lost it for Labour |newspaper=New Statesman |date=1 January 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606022117/http://www.newstatesman.com/199901010027 |archivedate=6 June 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some accounts suggest the event only received widespread attention after the election,&lt;ref&gt;Westlake, Martin (2001) ''Kinnock: The Biography'', pp.560–564&lt;/ref&gt; an opinion Kinnock shared in April 2010: "It wasn't until about ten days after the election that people started writing about the 'hubristic Sheffield rally' and all the rest of it."&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;Alyssa McDonald [http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2010/05/labour-party-interview-win "The NS Interview: Neil Kinnock"], ''New Statesman'', 29 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1995 interview for the [[BBC Two]] documentary series ''The Wilderness Years'', Kinnock said: "...all of the years in which I'd attempted to build a fairly reserved, starchy persona – in a few seconds, they slipped away."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Leapman [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/rush-of-blood-was-kinnocks-downfall-1583723.html "'Rush of blood' was Kinnock's downfall"], ''The Independent'', 26 November 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010 ''New Statesman'' interview, Kinnock clarified his opinion on the effect of his performance at the rally. He said: "Given my time again, I wouldn't repeat it – but the great legend is complete, bloody rubbish."&lt;ref name="McDonald"/&gt;

The '''Socialist Party''' is a [[Trotskyist]]&lt;Ref&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/harry-mcgee-people-before-profit-and-the-anti-austerity-alliance-spot-the-difference-1.2384459 Irish Times] – Harry McGee. “ For anybody who has not been intimately involved with the Socialist Workers Party or the Socialist Party, you would need to have a PhD in semantics and rhetoric to winkle out the actual ideological difference between them. They are both Trotskyist and advocate permanent revolution and political agitation through working class mass action in capitalist societies such as Ireland.”&lt;/ref&gt; political party in [[Ireland]], active in both the [[Politics of the Republic of Ireland|Republic of Ireland]] and [[Politics of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]. Internationally, it is affiliated to the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] [[Committee for a Workers' International]]. Party members [[Ruth Coppinger]], [[Mick Barry (Irish politician)|Mick Barry]] and [[Paul Murphy (Irish politician)|Paul Murphy]], were elected as [[Teachta Dála|TDs]] in the 32nd Dáil under the banner of "AAA-PBP". 
The Socialist Party has been involved in various [[Left-wing populism|populist]] campaigns including the [[Anti-Bin Tax Campaign]] and the [[Campaign Against Home and Water Taxes]]. Members of the party were jailed for their part in the former, while members have been arrested for their role in the latter. The Socialist Party has also been credited with bringing to light the [[GAMA Endustri|GAMA construction scandal]]. It had a seat in the [[European Parliament]] from 2009 to 2014. In 2015, the party received state funding of €132,000.&lt;Ref&gt;[http://www.sipo.ie/en/About-Us/News/Press-Releases/2016-Press-Releases/State-funding-of-political-parties-and-independent-members-under-the-electoral-legislation-political-parties-only-and-the-parliamentary-activities-allowance-legislation.html SIPO] - funding of party leaders&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2014, the party's election candidates in the Republic stood for office on behalf of the Anti-Austerity Alliance (AAA), now [[Solidarity (Ireland)|Solidarity]], which was a registered party in its own right between 2014 and 2015 and which continues to contest elections as part of [[Solidarity–People Before Profit]] (S–PBP).

==History==
The party was formed by former members of the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], collectively known as the '''Militant Tendency''', who were expelled in 1989 having been accused of Trotskyist [[entryism]]. They formed '''Militant Labour''', which became the Socialist Party in 1996.

===Foundation and Split from the Labour Party===
The party was founded in 1972 as a tendency within the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], grouped around the newsletter ''Militant Irish Monthly''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Conor|last=McCabe|url=http://www.irishleftreview.org/2009/11/07/john-throne-irish-militant|title=John Throne: Irish Militant|work=Irish Left Review|date=7 November 2009|accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tendency organised within the Labour Party throughout the 1970s and 1980s, attempting to win the party towards socialism, and briefly controlled [[Labour Youth]] from 1983 to 1986. People associated with it include Dermot Connolly, [[Clare Daly]], Finn Geaney, [[Joe Higgins]] and John Throne. In the late 1980s, a number of known members were expelled from Labour. In 1989 they established an independent party, adopting the title Militant Labour&amp;mdash;also used by other sections of the Committee for a Workers' International at the time. In 1996 the party merged fully with the [[Labour and Trade Union Group]] of Northern Ireland and changed its name to the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party has been particularly successful at building electoral support in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. It found it harder to gain an electoral foothold in Northern Ireland, but it has maintained a minor presence in the trade union movement there, as well as a youth wing.

===1996–2002 (27th and 28th Dáil)===
Militant Labour was renamed the Socialist Party in 1996, and came to wider attention among the general public when Joe Higgins polled just 252 votes behind victor [[Brian Lenihan Jnr]] in the [[Dublin West by-election, 1996|Dublin-West by-election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=1992B&amp;cons=112%20&amp;ref=115|title=Dublin West 1996|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=24 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215234751/http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=1992B&amp;cons=112%20&amp;ref=115|archivedate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Irish general election, 1997|general election of the following year]], Higgins was elected to [[Dáil Éireann]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=1997&amp;cons=112|title=Dublin West 1997|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=24 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215234833/http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=1997&amp;cons=112|archivedate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002–2007 (29th Dáil)===
[[File:Joe Higgins, Clare Daly and John Campbell Boycott the Household Tax.jpg|right|thumb|Socialist Party TDs [[Clare Daly]] (left) and [[Joe Higgins]] (centre), pictured here during the Boycott the Household Tax campaign in January 2012, were jailed for their part in the [[Anti-Bin Tax Campaign]].]]
At the [[Irish general election, 2002|2002 general election]], Joe Higgins retained his Dublin West seat in Dáil Éireann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2002&amp;cons=112|title=Dublin West 2002|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=24 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215234926/http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2002&amp;cons=112|archivedate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clare Daly]] narrowly missed out on gaining a second seat for the party in the Dublin North constituency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2002&amp;cons=96|title=Dublin North 2002|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=24 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215235012/http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2002&amp;cons=96|archivedate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anti-Bin Tax Campaign]] came about at this time. On 19 September 2003, Higgins and Daly were sent to [[Mountjoy Prison]] for a month after refusing to abide by a [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] [[injunction]] relating to the blockading of bin lorries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Grainne|last1=Cunningham|first2=Brian|last2=Dowling|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/outrage-over-jailed-tds-grandstand-bin-protest-205695.html|title=Outrage over jailed TD's 'grandstand' bin protest|work=Irish Independent|date=20 September 2003|accessdate=20 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/jail-sentences-for-joe-higgins-and-clare-daly-114124.html|title=Jail sentences for Joe Higgins and Clare Daly|work=BreakingNews.ie|date=19 September 2003|accessdate=19 September 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215234535/http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/jail-sentences-for-joe-higgins-and-clare-daly-114124.html|archivedate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Grainne|last=Cunningham|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/jail-will-not-break-mass-opposition-vow-campaigners-205678.html|title=Jail will not break mass opposition, vow campaigners|work=Irish Independent|date=20 September 2003|accessdate=20 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jerome|last=Reilly|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/far-left-pulling-the-strings-on-bin-charge-campaign-495806.html|title=Far left pulling the strings on bin charge campaign|work=Sunday Independent|date=19 October 2003|accessdate=19 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Irish local elections, 2004|2004 local elections]], the Socialist Party gained two council seats, with Mick Murphy being [[South Dublin County Council election, 2004|elected]] to [[South Dublin County Council]] and [[Mick Barry (Irish politician)|Mick Barry]] being [[Cork City Council election, 2004|elected]] to [[Cork City Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2004L&amp;cons=211|title=Tallaght Central 2004|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=24 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215235104/http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2004L&amp;cons=211|archivedate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2004L&amp;cons=452|title=Cork City North Central 2004|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=24 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215235231/http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2004L&amp;cons=452|archivedate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party also retained their two previous seats (held by Daly and [[Ruth Coppinger]]) on [[Fingal County Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2004L&amp;cons=210|title=Swords 2004|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=24 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215235312/http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2004L&amp;cons=210|archivedate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2004L&amp;cons=186|title=Mulhuddart 2004|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=24 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215235353/http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2004L&amp;cons=186|archivedate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Ireland)|European election held on the same day]], Joe Higgins received 23,218 (5.5%) votes in the [[Dublin (European Parliament constituency)|Dublin constituency]], but did not win a seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2004E&amp;cons=524|title=Dublin 2004|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=24 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215235432/http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2004E&amp;cons=524|archivedate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Councillor Mick Murphy was responsible for bringing the [[GAMA Endustri|GAMA construction scandal]] to light in October 2004.&lt;ref name="Builders"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Frank|last1=McDonald|authorlink1=Frank McDonald (journalist)|first2=Kathy|last2=Sheridan|authorlink2=Kathy Sheridan|year=2009|title=The Builders|publisher=Penguin|page=120|isbn=978-0-141-03780-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involved a group of Turkish workers being brought to Ireland by GAMA, a Turkish construction company.  They were illegally underpaid and forced to work hours in breach of the EU Working Time Directive.  Murphy discovered the workers living on the building site where they were employed.  After contacting the local council, GAMA and trade union officials and remaining unenlightened, Murphy wrote a leaflet in English, had it translated into Turkish "mainly to say that we had no problem with them being here, and saying what GAMA had said", then threw it over the hoarding surrounding the site.&lt;ref name="Builders"/&gt; Murphy brought it to the attention of his party colleague [[Joe Higgins]], who was then a TD for [[Dublin West (Dáil constituency)|Dublin West]], and Higgins raised the matter in [[Dáil Éireann]] on 8 February 2005, bringing public awareness to the workers' plight.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt; The exploitation included migrant Turkish construction workers bring employed on state projects, being paid as little as €2.20 an hour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0419/gama.html|title=Gama says Martin had no right to investigate|work=RTÉ News|date=19 April 2005|accessdate=19 April 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215235911/http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0419/62149-gama/|archivedate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the minimum wage in Ireland was €7.00) while being forced to work up to 80 hours per week.

==Policies==
According to its website, the Socialist Party "stands for the socialist alternative to the dictatorship of the markets – namely real democracy whereby ordinary people take centre stage in running society, with democratic public ownership of banks, of key sectors of the economy and industry, and a democratic plan of the economy to provide for the needs of people". It opposes the so-called "[[Social Partnership]]" deals and those in the [[trade union]] movement who advocate them, considering the agreements detrimental to the well-being of workers.&lt;ref name=about_us&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialistparty.ie/about-us/|title=About us|work=Socialist Party|accessdate=February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215215122/http://socialistparty.ie/about-us/|archivedate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds influence in the Northern Irish branch of the [[Fire Brigades' Union|FBU]], where its members played a key role in encouraging the FBU's split from the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2004/no-1201-september-2004/letter-fire-brigades-union|title=A letter to the Fire Brigades' Union|work=World Socialism|date=September 2004|accessdate=September 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215215358/http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2004/no-1201-september-2004/letter-fire-brigades-union|archivedate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as influence in [[Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance|NIPSA]] with members in the NIPSA Broad Left faction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialistparty.ie/2013/04/left-wins-majority-on-general-council-of-norths-largest-union|title=Left wins majority on General Council of North’s largest union|work=Socialist Party|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Socialist Party is Eurosceptic.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 
  
The Socialist Party is involved in many community campaigns, including the 1996 Anti Water Tax Campaign, the 2003–2004 [[Anti-Bin Tax Campaign]] and the current [[Campaign Against Home and Water Taxes]]. It opposes the U.S-led wars on [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], the occupation of [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]], [[targeted killing]]s and drone warfare in [[Drone strikes in Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Drone attacks in Yemen|Yemen]] and elsewhere and continues to be active in campaigns against fascism, racism, low pay exploitation and religious [[sectarianism]]. They claim to advocate on behalf of, and support, workers, women in the home, LGBT people and ethnic minorities.

Regarding the divided north, the Socialist Party opposes sectarian divisions between Protestants and Catholics and seeks to bring working class unity to both sides of the border. They argue that capitalism is incapable of overcoming sectarianism. The Socialist Party take a critical view of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] and other subsequent initiatives, claiming it further entrenches and institutionalises sectarianism and doesn't work towards solving the fundamental causes of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialistparty.ie/2014/11/northern-ireland-20-years-after-the-ceasefires/|title=Northern Ireland: 20 years after the ceasefires|work=Socialist Party|accessdate=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sointula''' is an isolated village on [[Malcolm Island]] in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. Lying between [[Vancouver Island]] and the British Columbia mainland, northeast of [[Port McNeill]] and not far from [[Alert Bay]], the island is part of the historic and present territory of the [[‘Namgis First Nation]]. At the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 census]], the village had a population of 576, down 3.0% from the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 census]].&lt;ref name="census2011"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=DPL&amp;Code1=590178&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=59&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Sointula&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;Custom=&amp;TABID=1  |title=Census Profile |work=Statistics Canada |year=2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Sointula'' means "Place of Harmony" (literally 'the place of [[Chord (music)|chord]]') in the [[Finnish language]]. A group of [[Finns|Finnish]] settlers founded the village in 1901 after rowing north from [[Nanaimo]]. They planned to set up a [[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] society known as the ''Kalevan Kansa'', and wrote to visionary [[Matti Kurikka]] in Finland to lead the new community. They were looking for a way out of [[List of coal mines and landmarks in the Nanaimo area|the mines]] operated by the Dunsmuir family on Vancouver Island. It was a physically hard life, and a devastating fire in the Sointula community hall in 1903 killed three adults and eight children&lt;ref name="play"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/09/15/sointula-finnish-commune-malcolm-island_n_3931149.html |title=Sointula Finnish Commune On Malcolm Island, B.C. Celebrated In Play |first=Dirk |last=Meissner |work=Huffington Post |date=September 15, 2013 |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost bringing the fledgling community to its knees. [[Kalervo Oberg]], a Finnish-Canadian anthropologist born in 1901, came with his family to Sointula in 1902, and they were caught in the fire of 1903. Two of his sisters died in the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sointulamuseum.ca/2011/09/kalervo-oberg-a-famous-son-of-sointula/ |title=Kalervo Oberg, a Famous Son of Sointula |work=sointulamuseum.ca |date=September 21, 2011 |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial difficulties continued to plague the group. They worked for free for two years on the [[Capilano Suspension Bridge|Capilano Bridge]] project, and after that the Kalevan Kansa was disbanded, but many of the community members remained on the island, as have their descendants.

The town remained and eventually prospered well into the 1970s as an unusually vibrant resource-based settlement. Fishing and logging activities have been the mainstay for the community. The early [[cooperative|cooperative ventures]] led to other businesses that are still operating, planting seeds that are also alive today. The Sointula Cooperative Store, the oldest [[Consumer cooperative|co-op shop]] in the province, still handles dry goods, groceries and fuel for the islanders. In addition there is a cooperative bakery, Wild Island Foods, which served Finnish bread (''[[pulla]]'') and home-cooked meals until the summer of 2008. The [[Worker cooperative|shellfish cooperative]], Malcolm Island Shellfish Coop (MISC), was involved in research on the feasibility of raising and selling [[abalone]], but closed for financial reasons in 2006. It relocated the abalone to an area near Port McNeill donated by Orca Sand and Gravel.

John Phelps was proposed for the position of emperor during a briefly contemplated secession movement in the 1990s. The idea, which was fomented at a pub one night, turned out to be impractical, and the separation movement was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/news/bc-150/bcs-big-picture/proud+isolation+from+attachment+canada/897275/story.html Vancouver Sun story]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 21st century, declining forestry and fishing industries have hit Sointula hard. Its school-age population has shrunk, although housing prices have risen, as owners from as far as [[California]] have bought homes as [[cottage|summer retreats]]. Sointula is home to the Sointula Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sointulamuseum.ca/ |title=Sointula Museum |work=sointulamuseum.ca |year=2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produces an online newsletter, the ''Sointula Ripple''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sointularipple.ca/ |title=Sointula Ripple  |work=sointularipple.ca |year=2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is easy to reach by car ferry, operated by [[BC Ferries]] from Port McNeill and Alert Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bcferries.com/schedules/northern/pmab-current.php |title=Schedules: Port McNeill - Alert Bay - Sointula (Vancouver Island-Cormorant Island-Malcolm Island) |work=BC Ferries |year=2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildlife on the island and in the waters around it is abundant. [[Killer whale|Orca whales]] return to the so-called "rubbing beaches" on Malcolm Island's northern edge near [[Bere Point Regional Park]] every summer and fall. [[Pinniped|Seals]] and [[porpoise]]s can be viewed from the beaches. Birds, [[mink]], [[otter]], [[beaver]], and [[deer]] live all over the island. The [[temperate rainforest]] vegetation helps to sustain the mood of an uncluttered and peaceful haven.

[[Bill Gaston]]'s novel ''Sointula'' (2004) is named for the community and has a plot that revolves in part around it. [[Rachel Lebowitz]]'s book ''Hannus'' (2006) is also partly about the early days of the commune. Paula Wild's book ''Sointula'' gives a good overview of the island’s ways and history. More recently, Sointula Museum, collaborating with the [[University of Victoria]], has published ''Practical Dreamers'', a history of the island's cooperatives complete with many historical pictures. In 2013 a Finnish troupe performed the play ''Sointula'' in the village. The troupe had raised $50,000 to be able to visit Sointula and perform.&lt;ref name="play"/&gt;

Sointula is also the location of [[Living Oceans Society]]'s head office, although it also has an office in [[Vancouver]]. Living Oceans Society, founded in 1998, is a non-profit research and public education organization committed to conserving marine [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]] in order to ensure a healthy ocean and healthy coastal communities. It is Canada's largest [[non-governmental organization]] focused on [[marine conservation]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.livingoceans.org/ |title=Living Oceans |work=livingoceans.org |year=2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more citations needed|date=August 2009}}

In [[United States]] [[law]], a '''state actor''' is a person who is acting on behalf of a governmental body, and is therefore subject to regulation under the [[United States Bill of Rights]], including the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]], which prohibit the federal and state governments from violating certain rights and freedoms.

Though the term would seem to include only persons who are directly employed by the state, the [[United States Supreme Court]] has interpreted these amendments and [[law]]s passed pursuant to them to cover many persons who have only an indirect relationship with the government. Controversies have arisen, for example, over whether private companies that run towns (the "company-town") and prisons (traditionally a state function) can be held liable as state actors when they violate fundamental civil rights. This question remains unresolved, but the Supreme Court has held private citizens to be liable as state actors when they conspire with government officials to deprive people of their rights.

Conversely, in ''[[National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Smith]]'', the Supreme Court has found that the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] is not a state actor for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. 1983 because it was national, rather than acting on behalf of one state actor. For the purposes of a [[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents|Bivens]]
action, however, it might still be a state actor.[http://chronicle.com/blogs/players/files/2012/02/Potuto1.pdf]

The 1989 case of ''[[DeShaney v. Winnebago County]]'' was decided on the basis of the ''state action doctrine''. Social workers separated a young son Joshua from his abusive father Randy, but concluded there was not enough evidence for a permanent separation, and later reunited son with father; later, the father beat his son into a persistent vegetative state. The [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] ruled that despite involvement by state social workers, the state of Wisconsin was not a ''state actor'' and was therefore not responsible. Accordingly, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment protections]] did not apply, according to constitutional scholar John E. Finn.&lt;ref name=tws3R18&gt;{{cite news

Unlike state actors, private actors are generally not required to afford individuals the constitutional rights mentioned above.  In nearly all U.S. states, private [[shopping center]] owners can eject [[protest]]ers from their land for [[trespassing]], and private associations can eject members or deny admission to applicants, with no warning and for no reason. But in a handful of states, notably [[California]], state constitutional protections and certain common law rights have been extended to limit private actors. California allows the peaceful exercise of free speech in private shopping centers (see ''[[Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins]]'' (1980)) and requires certain types of private actors to afford current or potential members a rudimentary version of procedural [[due process]] called [[fair procedure]].

==Jurisprudence==
There are a number of situations where the United States Supreme Court has recognized the conduct of individuals or private organizations to be "state action," and therefore subject to provisions of the Constitution such as Equal Protection, Due Process, or the First Amendment.  The Supreme Court has held the following:

# Merely opening up a business to the public is not state action, but the performance of a "public function" (a function that has been traditionally and exclusively performed by the state) is state action ([[Marsh v. Alabama]], 326 U.S. 501 (1946));
# If an individual or organization merely enters into a contract or asserts a contractual right outside of court it is not state action, but if an individual or organization sues to judicially enforce a contractual right it is state action ([[Shelley v. Kraemer]], 334 U.S. 1 (1948));
# If the government merely acquiesces in the performance of an act by a private individual or organization it is not state action, but if the government coerces, influences, or encourages the performance of the act, it is state action (Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830 (1982));
# If the government merely enters into a contract with an individual or organization for the goods or services, the actions of the private party are not state action, but if the government and the private party enter into a "joint enterprise" or a "symbiotic relationship" with each other it is state action (''[[Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority]]'', 365 U.S. 715 (1961));
# If government agencies are simply members of a private organization, the actions of the organization are not state action, but if the government is "pervasively entwined" with the leadership of the private organization, the acts of the organization are state action ([[Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Ass'n|Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association]], 535 U.S. 971 (2002)).

==Scholarly commentary==
According to constitutional law scholar [[Gillian E. Metzger]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 1367| last = Metzger| first = Gillian| title = Privatization as Delegation| journal = Colum. L. Rev.| url=https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/144/ |date = 2003-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The underlying presumption is that cases where private actors wield public power are rare and occur mainly when the government tries to hide behind private surrogates whom it controls. Current doctrine pays little attention to whether the government is, in fact, delegating power to private entities to act on its behalf. To the extent private delegations are considered, it is under the rubric of private delegation doctrine, which assesses whether the Constitution's separation of powers and due process requirements prohibit the government from delegating certain types of powers to private hands. But constitutional law makes no attempt to link the constitutionality of a private delegation to the risk that it will place government power outside of constitutional controls.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''territorial evolution of the British Empire''' is considered to have begun with the foundation of the [[English colonial empire]] in the late 16th century.  Since then, many territories around the world have been under the control of the United Kingdom or its predecessor states.

When the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] was formed in 1707 by the union of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] with the [[Kingdom of England]], the latter country's colonial possessions passed to the new state.  Similarly, when Great Britain was united with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] in 1801 to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], control over its colonial possessions passed to the latter state.  Collectively, these territories are referred to as the [[British Empire]].  Upon much of Ireland gaining independence in 1922 as the [[Irish Free State]], the other territories of the Empire remained under the control of the United Kingdom.

From 1714 to 1837 the British throne was held by a series of kings who were also the rulers of the [[States of the Holy Roman Empire|German state]] of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]].  However, this was purely a personal union, with Hanover maintaining its political independence otherwise, and so it is not usually considered to have formed part of the British Empire.

The nature of the territories (and peoples) ruled as part of the British Empire varied enormously.  In legal terms the territories included those formally under the sovereignty of the British monarch (who held the additional title of [[Emperor of India|Emperor (or Empress) of India]] from 1876 to 1947); various "foreign" territories controlled as protectorates; territories transferred to British administration under the authority of the [[League of Nations]] or the United Nations; and miscellaneous other territories, such as the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] with Egypt.  No uniform system of government was applied to any of these.

A number of countries ([[dominion]]s) within the British Empire gained independence in stages during the earlier part of the 20th century.  Much of the rest of the Empire was dismantled in the twenty years following the end of the [[Second World War]], starting with the independence of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in 1947, and considered to have ended with the handover of [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] [[Handover of Hong Kong|to China in 1997]].   There remain, however, 14 global [[British Overseas Territories|territories]] which remain under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom.

Many of the former territories of the British Empire are members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  Fifteen of these (known, with the United Kingdom, as the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s) retain the British monarch (currently Queen [[Elizabeth II]]) as Head of State. The British monarch is also Head of the Commonwealth, but this is a purely symbolic and personal title; members of the Commonwealth (including the Commonwealth realms) are fully sovereign states.   

== Governance ==
The British Empire refers to the possessions, dominions and dependencies under the control of [[the Crown]]. In addition to the areas formally under the sovereignty of the British monarch, various "foreign" territories were controlled as protectorates; territories transferred to British administration under the authority of the [[League of Nations]] or the [[United Nations]]; and miscellaneous other territories, such as the [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]. The natures of the administration of the Empire changed both by time and place, and there was no uniform system of government in the Empire.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Niall |year=2004 |title=Empire, The rise and demise of the British world order and the lessons for global power |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-02328-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SY67"/&gt;

=== Colonies ===
Colonies were territories that were intended to be places of permanent settlement, providing land for their settlers. The Crown claimed absolute sovereignty over them, although they were not formally part of the United Kingdom itself. Generally their law was the [[English law#Overseas influences|common law of England]] together with whatever British Acts of Parliament were also applied to them. Over time, a number of colonies were granted "[[responsible government]]", making them largely self-governing.

==== Crown Colony ====
{{Main article|Crown colony}}

A Crown colony was a type of colonial administration of the [[English overseas possessions|English]] and later the British Empire, whose legislature and administration were controlled by the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/caribbean_islands/cx_glos.html U.S. Library of Congress] - Glossary of terms.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/crowncolony?view=uk Compact Oxford English Dictionary - "Crown colony".]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cook Islands Annexation Ceremony.jpg|thumb|[[Lord Ranfurly]] reads the [[Cook Islands]] annexation proclamation to [[Makea Takau Ariki|Queen Makea]] on 7 October 1900.]]
Crown colonies were ruled by a governor appointed by the monarch.  By the middle of the 19th century, the sovereign appointed royal governors on the advice of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]]. This became the main method of creating and governing colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJenks|Jenks]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Crown colonies, especially the white settler colonies had a [[bicameral]] legislature, consisting of an upper house usually called the [[Legislative council]], which members were appointed and served a similar purpose as the British [[House of Lords]]. There also existed lower houses which were usually named the [[Legislative Assembly]] or [[House of Assembly]]. The lower house was usually elected, but [[suffrage]] was restricted to free white men only, usually with property ownership restrictions. Since land ownership was widespread, most white men could vote.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;Cooke (1993) vol 1 part 4&lt;/ref&gt; The governor also often had an [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]] which had a similar function to the Cabinet in England but was not responsible to the colonial lower house. They held a consultative position, however, and did not serve in administrative offices as cabinet ministers do. Members of the Executive Council were not necessarily members of the lower house but were usually members of the upper house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Frederick H.|title=Handbook of Upper Canadian Chronology (Revised ed.)|year=1985|publisher=Dundurn Press|location=Toronto|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later as the white colonies gained more internal [[responsible government]], the lower house began to supersede the (usually unelected) upper house as the colonial legislature, and the position of [[Premier]] emerged.&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;{{cite book| author = Christopher Moore| title = 1867: How the Fathers Made a Deal| date = 2011-07-27| publisher = McClelland &amp; Stewart| isbn = 978-1-55199-483-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The British Empire in 1897, marked in traditional pink.]]

==== Charter colony ====
{{Main article|Charter colony}}

Charter colony is one of the three classes of colonial government established in the 17th-century English colonies in North America. In a charter colony, the King granted a charter to the colonial government establishing the rules under which the colony was to be governed and charter colonies elected their own governors based on rules spelled out in the charter or other colonial legislation.&lt;ref&gt;

==== Proprietary colony ====
{{Main article|Proprietary colony}}

A number of colonies in the 16th and 17th centuries were granted to a particular individual; these were known as proprietary colonies. Proprietary colonies in America were governed by a [[Lords Proprietor|Lord Proprietor]], who, holding authority by virtue of a royal charter, usually exercised that authority almost as an independent sovereign. Eventually these were converted to Crown colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Roper (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elson, Henry William, ''History of the United States of America'', The MacMillan Company, New York, 1904. Chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chartered company ====
{{Main article|Chartered company}}

A chartered company is an association formed by investors or shareholders for the purpose of trade, exploration and colonisation. Chartered companies were usually formed, incorporated and legitimised under a [[royal charter]]. This document set out the terms under which the company could trade, defined its boundaries of influence, and described its rights and responsibilities. Groups of investors formed companies to underwrite and profit from the exploration of Africa, India, Asia, the Caribbean and North America, under the patronage of the state. Some companies such as the [[East India Company]] ruled large colonial possessions (especially in India).&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Niall, 2003. ''Empire—How Britain Made the Modern World'', Allan Lane, London, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/ch/chartere.html%20Chartered%20companies http://www.bartleby.com/65/ch/chartere.html Chartered companies]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protectorates and protected states ===
{{Main article|Protectorate}}
[[File:Prempeh-124-palaver-and-submission.jpg|thumb| Following the [[Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War]] in 1896, the British proclaimed a protectorate over the [[Ashanti Kingdom]].]]
A protectorate is a territory which is not formally annexed but in which, by treaty, grant or other lawful means, the Crown has power and jurisdiction. A protectorate differs from a "protected state". A protected state is a territory under a foreign ruler which enjoys British protection, over whose foreign affairs she exercises control, but in respect of whose internal affairs she does not exercise jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=SY67&gt;The Statesman's Yearbook 1967-1968&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominions ===
{{Main article|Dominion}}

Dominions were [[autonomy|semi-independent]] [[polity|polities]] that were nominally under [[the Crown]], constituting the British Empire and [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], beginning in the later part of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/dominion ''Merriam Webster's Dictionary''] (based on Collegiate vol., 11th ed.) 2006. Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Hillmer|first = Norman|year = 2001|title = Commonwealth|publisher = Canadian Encyclopedia|location = Toronto|url = http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001798|quote=...the Dominions (a term applied to Canada in 1867 and used from 1907 to 1948 to describe the empire's other self-governing members)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dominions had been previously Crown colonies, and some of the colonies had been united to form dominions such as [[Union of South Africa]] and [[Commonwealth of Australia]]. Dominion status was formally defined in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], which recognised these countries as "autonomous Communities within the British Empire", thus acknowledging them as political equals of the United Kingdom; the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] converted this status into legal reality, making them essentially independent members of what was then called the British Commonwealth. Initially, the Dominions conducted their own trade policy, some limited foreign relations and had autonomous [[armed forces]], although the British government claimed and exercised the exclusive power to declare wars. However, after the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] the language of dependency on the Crown of the United Kingdom ceased, where the Crown itself was no longer referred to as the Crown of any place in particular but simply as "the Crown". [[Arthur Berriedale Keith]], in Speeches and Documents on the British Dominions 1918–1931, stated that "the Dominions are sovereign international States in the sense that the King in respect of each of His Dominions (Newfoundland excepted) is such a State in the eyes of international law". After then, those countries that were previously referred to as "Dominions" became [[Commonwealth realm]]s where the sovereign reigns no longer as the British monarch, but as monarch of each nation in its own right, and are considered equal to the United Kingdom and one another.

=== Mandates ===
{{Main article|League of Nations mandate}}

Mandates were forms of territory created after the end of the [[First World War]]. A number of German colonies and protectorates and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] provinces were held as [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]] by the United Kingdom ([[Tanganyika]], [[British Cameroons]], [[British Togoland|Togoland]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[British Mandate for Mesopotamia (legal instrument)|Mesopotamia]], and its dominions of [[Australia]] ([[Territory of New Guinea|New Guinea]], [[History of Nauru#German protectorate|Nauru]]) [[New Zealand]] ([[Western Samoa Trust Territory|Western Samoa]], and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] ([[South West Africa]]).  In theory these territories were governed on behalf of the [[League of Nations]] for the benefit of their inhabitants.  Most converted to [[United Nations Trust Territories]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0511207069 Peace Treaties and International Law in European History, From the Late Middle Ages to World War One]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British Raj ===
{{Main article|British Raj}}

The British Raj, also called the Indian Empire, was the imperial political structure in the [[Indian subcontinent]] between 1858 and 1947, comprising British India (a Crown colony: [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|presidencies and provinces]] directly governed by the British Crown through the [[Viceroy and Governor-General of India]]) and [[Princely State]]s, governed by Indian rulers, under the [[suzerainty]] of the British Crown exercised through the Viceroy and Governor-General of India.&lt;ref name="Interpretation Act 1889"&gt;Interpretation Act 1889 (52 &amp; 53 Vict. c.&amp;nbsp;63), s.&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current territories==
[[File:Riseandfall1.PNG|thumb|350px|The Rise and Fall of the British Empire, graph starting in 1861]]

Within twenty years of the partition and independence in 1947 of [[British India]] (considered to be the most important colonial possession), most of the Empire's territories had achieved full independence.  Today 14 former colonies (since 2002 known as [[British Overseas Territory|British Overseas Territories]]) remain under British rule; the term "colonies" is no longer officially used to describe these.

Almost all of the British Overseas Territories are islands (or groups of islands) with a small population; some are in very remote areas of the world.  Of the territories with a permanent population, all have at least some degree of internal self-government, with the United Kingdom retaining responsibility for defence and external relations.

The fourteen British Overseas Territories are:
*{{flag|Anguilla}}
*{{flag|Bermuda}}
*{{flag|British Antarctic Territory}}
*{{flag|British Indian Ocean Territory}}
*{{flag|British Virgin Islands}}
*{{flag|Cayman Islands}}

'''''The FairTax Book''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book by [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[radio]] [[talk show]] host [[Neal Boortz]] and [[United States Congress|Congressman]] [[John Linder]], published on August 2, 2005, as a tool to increase public support and understanding for the [[FairTax]] plan.&lt;ref name="fairtaxbook"&gt;{{cite book | first=Neal | last=Boortz |author2=Linder, John  | year=2006 | title=The FairTax Book: Saying Goodbye to the Income Tax and the IRS | edition=Paperback | publisher=[[Regan Books]] | isbn=0-06-087549-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Released by [[ReganBooks]], the [[hardcover]] version held the #1 spot on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for the last two weeks of August 2005 and remained in the top ten for seven weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Kempner, "''The FairTax Book'' author from Atlanta is pumping up volume on sales of book."

It also spent several weeks on the ''New York Times'' Best Seller list. Boortz stated that he donates his share of the proceeds to [[Charitable organization|charity]] to promote the book.&lt;ref name="boortzbook"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://boortz.com/nuze/200509/09202005.html| last=Boortz| first=Neal| title=Nealz Nuze| work=| publisher=Cox Radio| date=2005-09-07| accessdate=2006-08-07| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831050128/http://boortz.com/nuze/200509/09202005.html| archivedate=2006-08-31| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FairTax TheTruth.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''FairTax: The Truth – 272 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-06-154046-2}}]]
The book was published as a companion to the ''Fair Tax Act of 2005'', which was a [[legislation|bill]] in the [[109th United States Congress]] for changing tax laws to replace the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and all [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] [[Income tax in the United States|income taxes]] (including [[Alternative Minimum Tax|AMT]]), [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|payroll taxes]] (including [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|Social Security and Medicare taxes]]), [[Corporate tax in the United States|corporate taxes]], [[capital gains tax]]es, [[gift tax]]es, and [[Estate tax in the United States|estate taxes]] with a national retail [[sales tax]], to be levied once at the point of purchase on all new [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]]. The proposal also calls for an advance monthly tax rebate to [[household]]s of citizens and legal resident aliens, to "untax" purchases up to the poverty level.&lt;ref name="Kotlikoff"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://people.bu.edu/kotlikoff/WSJ%20Op%20Ed%203-7-05.pdf| last=Kotlikoff| first=Laurence| title=The Case for the 'FairTax'| work=| publisher=The Wall Street Journal| date=2005-03-07| accessdate=2006-07-23| format=PDF| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614173135/http://people.bu.edu/kotlikoff/WSJ%20Op%20Ed%203-7-05.pdf| archivedate=2006-06-14| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was reintroduced in January 2007 as the ''Fair Tax Act of 2007''.

'''''The Political Machine''''' is a [[government simulation game]] from [[Stardock]] and the first game in the ''[[The Political Machine (series)|Political Machine]]'' series, in which the player leads a [[election campaign|campaign]] to elect the [[President of the United States]]. The player accomplishes this goal by traveling from state to state and engaging in a variety of activities to either raise money or raise [[Opinion poll|poll]] numbers.

Each game starts with the selection of a pre-created candidate or creation of a fictional candidate from one of the two major American political parties, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

Headquarters and [[fundraisers]] are possible, the effectiveness of which depends on various factors.

When enough money is accumulated the player can "invest" it in [[campaign advertising|advertisements]] (either through newspapers, radio, or [[television advertisement|TV media]]). The effectiveness of these ads are determined by several factors. For instance, an ad supporting [[tax cuts]] will work better with Republican [[Texas]] than with Democratic [[Massachusetts]].

A key factor in the game is the concept of "Stamina" and "Turns." In each turn, representing one week, a candidate has a set amount of stamina to engage in activities. For example, establishing or upgrading a campaign HQ costs more stamina than creating a newspaper ad.

A sequel, ''[[The Political Machine 2008]]'', was released June 16, 2008, with new characters introduced, such as [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]].

A second sequel, ''[[The Political Machine 2012]]'', was released July 31, 2012, with new characters introduced, such as Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum.

A third sequel, ''[[The Political Machine 2016]]'', was released February 4, 2016, with new characters introduced.

{{Sri Lankan Tamil history}}
'''Thiruvenkadam Velupillai Prabhakaran''' ({{audio|En-us-Velupillai Prabhakaran from Sri Lanka pronunciation (Voice of America).ogg|listen (US English)|help=no}}; {{lang-ta|வேலுப்பிள்ளை பிரபாகரன்}}; {{IPA-ta|ˈʋeːlɯpːɨɭːɛi̯ prəˈbɑːɦərən}}, 26 November 1954{{spaced ndash}} 19 May 2009) was the founder and leader of the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (the LTTE or the Tamil Tigers), a militant organization that sought to create an independent [[Tamil Eelam|Tamil state]] in the north and east of [[Sri Lanka]].

For over 25 years, the LTTE waged [[Sri Lankan Civil War|war in Sri Lanka]] to create an independent state for the [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Sri Lankan Tamil people]].  Founded in 1976, the LTTE rocketed to prominence in 1983 after [[Four Four Bravo|they ambushed a patrol]] of the [[Sri Lanka Army]] outside [[Jaffna]], resulting in the deaths of 13 soldiers. This ambush, along with the [[Black July|subsequent rioting]] which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Tamil civilians, is generally considered the start of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. After years of fighting, including the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force|intervention]] of the [[Indian Army]] ([[IPKF]]), the conflict was halted after international mediation in 2001. By then, the LTTE also known as the ''Tamil Tigers'' controlled large swathes of land in the north and east of the country, running a [[de facto]] state with Prabhakaran serving as its leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=UbNEAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2j-KQy-zaAhWCiiwKHaNYCJUQ6AEIRTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=de%20facto%20tamil%20eelam|title=Suicide Protest in South Asia: Consumed by Commitment|last=Lahiri|first=Simanti|date=2014-04-03|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317803133|location=|pages=108|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peace talks eventually broke down, and the [[Sri Lanka Army]] launched a [[Eelam War 4|military campaign]] to defeat the Tamil Tigers in 2006.

Prabhakaran was reportedly killed in the fighting with the Sri Lankan Army on 18 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7885473.stm&lt;/ref&gt; The troops also claimed to have found the body of Charles Anthony, 24, Prabhakaran's son.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/srilanka/5342331/Tamil-Tiger-leader-Velupillai-Prabhakaran-shot-dead.html&lt;/ref&gt; His wife's and daughter's bodies were reportedly found by the Sri Lankan army but the report was later denied by the Sri Lankan government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/01/17/death-of-the-tiger&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that his 12-year-old second son was executed a short time later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mcrae|first=Callum|title=The Killing of a Young Boy|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-killing-of-a-young-boy/article4428792.ece|accessdate=2013-02-20|newspaper=The Hindu|date=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prabhakaran's reported death and the announcement "We have decided to silence our guns. Our only regrets are for the lives lost and that we could not hold out for longer," by [[Selvarasa Pathmanathan]], the Tigers' chief of international relations brought an end to the [[armed conflict]].&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

In 1975, after becoming heavily involved in the Tamil movement, he carried out the first major political assassination by a Tamil group, killing the mayor of [[Jaffna]], [[Alfred Duraiappah]], by shooting him at point-blank range when he was about to enter the Hindu temple at Ponnaalai. The assassination was in response to the [[1974 Tamil conference incident]], for which the Tamil radicals had blamed Duraiappah,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uthr.org/Book/CHA02.htm#_Toc527947383 |title=Welcome to UTHR, Sri Lanka |publisher=Uthr.org |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; because he backed the then ruling [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/DA26Df04.html |title=Asia Times: Sri Lanka: The Untold Story |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2002-01-26 |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tamil Tigers==

===Founding of the LTTE===
In the early 1970s, United Front government of [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] introduced the [[Policy of standardisation]] which made the criteria for university admission lower for the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] than for the Tamils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?hl=no&amp;id=L431UcNtY6AC&amp;dq=Sirimavo+Bandaranaike+Policy+of+standardization&amp;q=%22+Standardisation+Policy%22|title=Sri Lanka's Post-conflict Strategy: Restorative Justice for Rebels and Rebuilding of Conflict-affected Communities|last=Dharmawardhane|first=Iromi|date=2014|publisher=Research &amp; Monitoring Division, Department of Government Information, Sri Lanka|year=|isbn=9789559073284|location=|pages=16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several organizations to counter this act was formed by Tamil students. Prabhakaran aged 15, dropped out of school and got associated with the ''Kuttimani-Thangathurai'' ''group'' (which evolved later into [[Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization|TELO]]) formed by [[Selvarajah Yogachandran]] (known as Kuttimani) and [[Nadarajah Thangathurai]] who both also hailed from [[Valvettithurai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=ZdTZCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0rOfY1ezaAhULLlAKHRfECf8Q6AEIWTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Tamil%20Manavar%20Peravai|title=Pain, Pride, and Politics: Social Movement Activism and the Sri Lankan Tamil Diaspora in Canada|last=Amarasingam|first=Amarnath|date=2015-09-15|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=|isbn=9780820348148|location=|pages=25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prabhakaran along with [[Kuttimani]], [[Pon Sivakumaran|Ponnuthurai Sivakumaran]] and other prominent rebels joined the ''Tamil Manavar Peravai'' formed by a student named ''Satiyaseelan'' in 1970.

A number of questions were asked about LTTE's commitment towards the erstwhile peace process and Prabhakaran and Dr. Anton Balasingham jointly answered the questions.

Repeated questions of his involvement in the [[Rajiv Gandhi]] assassination were only answered in a sober note by both Balasingham and Prabhakaran. They called it a "tragic incident" ("Thunbiyal Chambavam", as quoted in Tamil) they requested the press "not to dig into an incident that happened 10 years ago."{{cite this quote|date=May 2018}}

During the interview he stated that the right condition has not risen to give up the demand of Tamil Eelam. He further mentioned that "There are three fundamentals. That is Tamil homeland, Tamil nationality and Tamil right to self-determination. These are the fundamental demands of the Tamil people. Once these demands are accepted or a political solution is put forward by recognising these three fundamentals and our people are satisfied with the solutions we will consider giving up the demand for Eelam." He further added that Tamil Eelam was not only the demand of the LTTE but also the demand of the Tamil people.&lt;ref name=tnr /&gt;

Prabhakaran also answered a number of questions in which he reaffirmed their commitment towards peace process, quoted "We are sincerely committed to the peace process. It is because we are sincerely committed to peace that we continued a four month cessation of hostilities" was also firm in de-proscription of the LTTE by Sri Lanka and India, "We want the government of India to lift the ban on the LTTE. We will raise the issue at the appropriate time."

Prabhakaran also insisted firmly that only de-proscription would bring forth an amenable solution to the ongoing peace process mediated by [[Norway]]: "We have informed the government, we have told the Norwegians that de-proscription is a necessary condition for the commencements of talks."&lt;ref&gt;Assignment Colombo at page xv(15), {{ISBN|81-220-0499-7}}, published by Konark Publishers Pvt Ltd, delhi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

==Philosophy and ideology==

Prabhakaran was fascinated by [[Napoleon]] and [[Alexander the Great]]. He was also highly influenced by prominent Indian nationalists [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] and [[Bhagat Singh]] who fought the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3236030.stm|title=The enigma of Prabhakaran|publisher=news.bbc.co.uk | first=Alastair|last=Lawson|date=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prabhakaran never developed a systematic [[philosophy]], but did declare that his goal was 'Revolutionary [[socialism]] and the creation of an egalitarian society'. His rare interviews, his annual Tamil Eelam Heroes Day speeches and the policies and actions of the LTTE can be taken as indicators of Prabhakaran's philosophy and ideology. Religion was not a major factor in his philosophy or ideology, the ideology of the Tamil Tigers emerged from [[Marxist-Leninist]] thought, and was explicitly secular. Its leadership professed opposition to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bermana|first=Eli|author2=David D.

The following are important areas when considering the philosophy and ideology of Prabhakaran.

===Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism===
Prabhakaran's source of inspiration and direction was [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism]]. His stated and ultimate ideal was to get [[Tamil Eelam]] recognised as a [[nation]] as per the U.N. Charter that guarantees the right of a people to political independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cpr.html |title=UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |publisher=Hrweb.org |date=1994-07-07 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LTTE also proposed the formation of an [[Interim Self Governing Authority]] during Peace Negotiations in 2003. Former Tamil guerrilla and politician [[D. Siddarthan|Dharmalingam Sithadthan]] has remarked that Prabhakaran's "dedication to the cause of the [[Tamil Eelam]] was unquestionable, he was the only man in Sri Lanka who could decide if there should be war or peace."&lt;ref name="SunGodWar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_378372.html |title='Sun God's' Life of War |accessdate=2009-05-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112085518/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_378372.html |archivedate=2010-11-12 |df= }}. ''Straits Times'', 18 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Prabhakaran was also called "Karikalan" for his bravery and his administration (in reference to [[Karikala Chola]], a famous [[Chola]] king who ruled in [[Sangam Age]].)
[[File:LTTE Sea Tigers cadre transport.JPG|thumb|The LTTEs [[Sea Tigers]] wing]]

===Militarism of the LTTE===
Prabhakaran explicitly stated that an armed struggle is the only way to resist [[asymmetric warfare]], in which one side, that of the Sri Lankan government, is armed and the other comparatively unarmed. He argued that he chose military means only after observing that [[Nonviolence|non–violent]] means have been ineffectual and obsolete, especially after the [[Thileepan]] incident. Thileepan, a colonel rank officer adopted [[Gandhi]]an means to protest against the IPKF killings by staging a fast unto death from 15 September 1987, and by abstaining from food or water until 26 September, when he died in front of thousands of Tamils who had come there to fast along with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?hl=no&amp;id=3i1uAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=thileepan+ipkf&amp;q=thileepan|title=Sri Lanka: the arrogance of power : myths, decadence &amp; murder|last=Hoole|first=Rajan|last2=Thiranagama|first2=Rajani|last3=(Jaffna)|first3=University Teachers for Human Rights|last4=Lanka)|first4=University of Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna, Sri|date=2001|publisher=University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna)|year=|isbn=9789559447047|location=|pages=227|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tactically, Prabhakaran perfected the recruitment and use of [[suicide bomber]] units. His fighters usually took no prisoners and were notorious for assaults that often left every single enemy soldier dead.&lt;ref name="SunGodWar" /&gt; [[Interpol]] described him as someone who was "very alert, known to use disguise and capable of handling sophisticated weaponry and explosives."&lt;ref name="SunGodWar" /&gt;

==Death==
When the Sri Lankan military rapidly advanced into the last LTTE held territory in the final days of [[2008–2009 SLA Northern offensive]], Prabhakaran and his top leadership retreated into Vellamullivaikkal, [[Mullaitivu]]. Fierce fighting occurred between LTTE and the [[Sri Lanka Army]] during these last few days. At around 3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 18 May 2009, Prabhakaran's son Charles Anthony tried to break the defenses of the Army, but was unsuccessful. He died along with around 100 other LTTE fighters. Troops found 12 million rupees in his possession.&lt;ref name="lankaw"&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.lankaweb.com/news/items/2011/06/11/no-peace-offer-from-prabhakaran-%E2%80%93-only-war/ | title = No peace offer from Prabhakaran – only war | date = 2011-06-11 | accessdate=2011-06-20 | work=Lanka Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the noon of that day, reports emerged that Prabhakaran was killed by a rocket attack while trying to flee the conflict zone in a captured ambulance and his body was badly burned.&lt;ref name="hindus"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Prabhakaran-is-dead/Article1-411894.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130125070401/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Prabhakaran-is-dead/Article1-411894.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-25|title=Prabhakaran is dead|date=2009-05-18|accessdate=2011-06-20|work=The Hindustan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this rumor was proven false in a short while. Skirmishes occurred also in the evening of 18 May around eastern bank of Nandikadal lagoon. A team of LTTE cadres consisting of 30 most loyal bodyguards of Prabhakaran and Prabhakaran himself tried to sneak through the mangrove islands of Nandikadal to its west bank. It has been alleged that one bodyguard had a can of gasoline with him to burn the Tiger leader's body if he is killed or committed suicide. This was to prevent the enemy seizing his body.&lt;ref name="dbsjey"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/archives/615|title=The last days of Thiruvenkadam Veluppillai Prabhakaran|date=2009-05-22|accessdate=2011-06-20| work=Lanka Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearing and mopping-up operations were carried out by troops under [[Colonel]] G. V. Ravipriya from 3:30 pm to 6:30 pm that evening. But they did not encounter this last group of LTTE fighters that day. At 7:30 am next morning, mopping-up operations started again. This time, they were confronted by the fighters, led by Prabhakaran himself. Fighting went on until 9.30 am 19 May 2009. The firing stopped as all LTTE fighters died in the battle. Troops started collecting bodies again. This time, [[Sergeant]] Muthu Banda, attached to Sri Lanka Army Task Force VIII, reported to its commander, Colonel G. V. Ravipriya, that a body similar to Velupillai Prabhakaran had been found. After the body, which was floating among the mangroves, was brought ashore, Colonel Ravipriya positively identified it as that of the leader of the LTTE.&lt;ref name="lankaw"/&gt; A dog tag marked ''001'', two pistols, a [[Type 56 assault rifle|T56]] rifle with telescopic sight, a satellite phone, and a canister filled with diabetic medicine were found along with the body.

At 12:15 pm army commander [[Sarath Fonseka]] officially announced Prabhakaran's death on TV. At around 1:00 pm his body was shown in [[Swarnavahini]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.army.lk/vgallery.php?galid=29 | title = Sri Lanka Army – Defenders of the Nation | publisher = Army.lk | accessdate = 2009-05-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090523092610/http://www.army.lk/vgallery.php?galid=29 | archivedate = 2009-05-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prabakaran's identity was confirmed by [[Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan|Karuna Amman]], his former confidant, and through DNA testing against genetic material from his son, who had been killed earlier by the Sri Lankan military.&lt;ref name="DNA"&gt;

The '''White Nationalist Party''' (WNP) was a [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] [[United Kingdom|British]] [[political party]], founded in May 2002 as "the British political wing of Aryan Unity".&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, Alan ''The Radical Right in Britain'' Palgrave (2005), p 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aryanunity.com/WNP/wnpintro.html Aryan Unity website]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Development==

The party was formed by [[Eddy Morrison]], and [[Kevin Watmough]] "a key figure in [[Combat 18]]" and webmaster of [[Redwatch]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/index.php?link=template&amp;story=37 Searchlight Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; the new party was effectively the [[Yorkshire]] branch of the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]], and the party conducted most of its activities in Yorkshire. The national youth leader of the White Nationalist Party was Ronnie Cooper, a teen from the South Yorkshire area who was exposed for his fascist beliefs by the ''Sunday People'' newspaper in 2003. Cooper is now understood to be a serving member of the Royal Navy.

Although largely Yorkshire-based it also sought to expand elsewhere. In 2003 the group applied to march in [[Glasgow]] but it was rejected by the city council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Davidson |title= TALKING POLITICS: White Nationalist Party. |newspaper= [[Sunday Mirror]] {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}} |accessdate= 3 November 2014 |date= 21 September 2003 |first= Lorraine |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-107977093.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WNP also sought to campaign in amongst [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] in [[Northern Ireland]], posting stickers and delivering leaflets in [[Ballymena]], [[Coleraine]], [[Antrim town]] and [[Ballymoney]] in the run-up to [[the Twelfth]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Kelly |title= Racists' campaign 'must be stopped' Drive for recruits sparks concern |newspaper= [[Belfast Telegraph]] {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}} |accessdate= 3 November 2014 |date= 6 June 2003 |first= Kim |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-10692232.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group, which emphasised its anti-[[Irish republican]] nature by using slogans such as "hang IRA scum" in its literature, claimed to have 80 members in the province in May of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Kelly |title= Right-wing group targets Ballymoney |newspaper= [[Belfast Telegraph]] {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}} |accessdate= 3 November 2014 |date= 16 May 2003 |first= Kim |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-10686265.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a move condemned by local politicians WNP flags were also placed on lampposts in Ballymena around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=  |title= Racist fears heighten as Nazi flags flown.(News) |newspaper= [[The News Letter]] {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}} |accessdate= 3 November 2014 |date= 24 July 2003 |first=  |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-105763845.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the party's stickers and flags were removed by parties of residents organised in opposition by the loyalist [[Progressive Unionist Party]], which publicly condemned racism.&lt;ref name="rock"/&gt;

In 2004 the party also revealed plans to host a [[Blood &amp; Honour]] music festival in Northern Ireland although a counter-campaign was organised to encourage venues to turn down the booking.&lt;ref name="rock"&gt;{{Cite news |last=  |title= Opposition to 'fascist' rock gig growing Website warns of plans for concert |newspaper= [[Belfast Telegraph]] {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}} |accessdate= 3 November 2014 |date= 18 May 2004 |first=  |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-10705048.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed gigs did not take place however.

The WNP was severely weakened in 2004 when the [[England First Party]] (EFP) broke away under [[Mark Cotterill]]. The WNP had intended to use that name when the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] refused to register WNP as an official name;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2003-4/uk.htm Article on Anti-Semitic groups]&lt;/ref&gt;  but after a dispute between Cotterill on the one side and [[Eddy Morrison]] and [[John G. Wood]] (the WNP's national organiser) on the other, the EFP group broke away to become a separate, English nationalist, party.

The WNP under Morrison and John G. Wood courted [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]], although he refused {{Citation needed|reason=where is this claimed?|date=December 2008}} to join as he did not feel that divisions were helpful. Eventually Eddy Morrison left the party and with John G. Wood and Kevin Watmough in 2005 formed the similar [[British Peoples Party (2005)|British People's Party]].

==Policies and ideology==

The White Nationalist Party's inspiration was "unashamedly nationalist socialist" and opposed to "all democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, Alan ''The Radical Right in Britain'' Palgrave (2005), p 148&lt;/ref&gt; The WP had a list of 32 policies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aryanunity.com/WNP/policies.html Policies of the White Nationalist Party]&lt;/ref&gt; based on principles which included repatriation, opposition to [[populism]], [[Zionism]] and [[homosexuality]], and adherence to [[David Lane (white nationalist)|David Lane]]'s [[fourteen words]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aryanunity.com/WNP/nocompromise.html White Nationalist Party website]&lt;/ref&gt; The group is now vehemently opposed to the [[British National Party]], viewing them as [[Race traitor|race traitors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aryanunity.com/WNP/griffinfile1.html Anti-Griffin page]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Ferguson Massey''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|PC|size=85%}} (26 March 1856 – 10 May 1925), commonly known as '''Bill Massey''', was an Irish-born politician in New Zealand who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|19th Prime Minister of New Zealand]] from  May 1912 to May 1925. He was the founding leader of the  [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]], New Zealand's second organised political party, from 1909 until his death.

Massey was born in [[County Londonderry]] in Ireland. After migrating to New Zealand in 1870, Massey farmed near [[Auckland]] (earning his later nickname, ''Farmer Bill'') and assumed leadership in farmers' organisations. He entered parliament in 1894 as a [[historic conservatism in New Zealand|conservative]], and from 1894 to 1912 was a leader of the conservative opposition to the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal]] ministries of [[Richard Seddon]] and [[Joseph Ward]]. Massey became the first Reform Party Prime Minister following Ward's resignation in March 1912. Throughout his political career Massey was known for the particular support he showed for [[agrarianism|agrarian]] interests, as well as his opposition to [[organised labour]]. He pledged New Zealand's support for Britain during the [[First World War]]. 

Massey led his Reform Party through four elections, although only the [[New Zealand general election, 1919|1919 election]] was a decisive victory over all other parties. After Richard Seddon, he is the second-[[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand by term|longest-serving]] Prime Minister of New Zealand.

==Early life==
Massey was born in 1856 into a Protestant farming family, and grew up in [[Limavady]], [[County Londonderry]] in Ireland. His father John Massey and his mother Marianne (or Mary Anne) née Ferguson were tenant farmers, who also owned a small property. His family arrived in New Zealand on 21 October 1862 on board the ''Indian Empire''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Port of Onehunga |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=DSC18621021.2.3.2 |newspaper=[[Daily Southern Cross]] |volume=XVIII |issue=1638 |date=21 October 1862 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Nonconformist settlers,&lt;ref&gt;1911 Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; although Massey remained in Ireland for a further eight years to complete his education. After arriving on 10 December 1870 on the ''City of Auckland'', Massey worked as a farmhand for some years before acquiring his own farm in Mangere, south Auckland, in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=34921&amp;back=&amp;version=2006-10 |title=Oxford DNB |publisher=Oxford DNB |date=1925-05-10 |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882 Massey married his neighbour's daughter, [[Christina Allan Massey|Christina Allan Paul]]. They had seven children.&lt;ref name="DNZB Massey"&gt;{{DNZB|Gustafson|Barry|2m39|Massey, William Ferguson|10 December 2011||Barry Gustafson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Massey gradually became more prominent in his community. This was partly due to his civic involvement in the school board, the debating society,&lt;!-- [[freemasonry]] and the [[Orange Order]], ANY PROOF?? --&gt;and farming associations. Because of his prominence in these circles, he became involved in political debate, working on behalf of rural conservatives against the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] government of [[John Ballance]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} William Massey was a member of the [[Orange Order]], [[Oddfellows]], and [[freemasons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/2m39/massey-william-ferguson |title=Massey, William Ferguson – Biography – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand |website=Teara.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and espoused [[British Israelism|British Israelite]] ideas.&lt;ref&gt;

Massey joined the ranks of the (mostly conservative) independent MPs opposing the Liberal Party, led by [[Richard Seddon]]. They were poorly organised and dispirited, and had little chance of unseating the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberals]]. [[William Russell (New Zealand politician)|William Russell]], the [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]], was able to command only 15 votes. Massey brought increased vigour to the conservative faction.

While the conservatives rallied for a time, support for the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberals]] increased markedly during the [[Second Boer War]], leaving the conservatives devastated. Massey's political career survived the period: despite a challenge by [[William Herries]], he remained the most prominent opponent to the Liberal Party.

After Seddon's death the Liberals were led by [[Joseph Ward]], who proved more vulnerable to Massey's attacks. In particular, Massey made gains by claiming that alleged corruption and cronyism within the civil service was ignored or abetted by the Liberal government. His conservative politics also benefited him when voters grew concerned about militant [[trade union|unionism]] and the supposed threat of socialism.

===Reform Party===

In February 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Reform Party |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19090212.2.97 |accessdate=23 March 2016 |work=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |volume=LXVVII |issue=36 |date=12 February 1909 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massey announced the creation of the [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]] from his New Zealand Political Reform League. The party was to be led by him and backed by his conservative colleagues.

In the [[New Zealand general election, 1911|1911 election]] the Reform Party won more seats than the Liberal Party but did not gain an absolute majority. The Liberals, relying on support from independents who had not joined Reform, were able to stay in power until the following year, when they lost a vote of confidence.

==Prime Minister==
Massey was sworn in as [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] on 10 July 1912. Two days later it was reported in the press on 12 July that he had accepted the appointment of Honorary Commandant of the Auckland District of the Legion of Frontiersmen. Some members of the Reform Party grew increasingly frustrated at Massey's dominance of the party. He earned the enmity of many workers with his harsh response to [[Waihi miners' strike|miners']] and [[1913 Great Strike|waterfront workers' strikes]] in 1912 and 1913. The use of force to deal with the strikers made Massey an object of hatred for the emerging left-wing, but conservatives (many of whom believed that the unions were controlled by the far left) generally supported him, saying that his methods were necessary. His association with the Legion of Frontiersmen assisted him greatly during this period as a number of mounted units, including Levin Troop, rode to Wellington in mufti and assisted as Special Constables. In the Levin Troop was a young [[Bernard Freyberg]], who would shortly earn the Victoria Cross near Beaumont Hamel.

Amongst the first Acts enacted by Massey's government was one that "enabled some 13,000 Crown tenants to purchase their own farms."&lt;ref name="UCred"&gt;{{Citation |last=Allen |first=Sam |title=To Ulster's Credit |year=1985 |page=116 |location=Killinchy, UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
{{Cquote|All we are and all we have is at the disposal of the British Government.|20px|20px|Cable from Massey to the British Government, 1914&lt;ref name="UCred"/&gt;}}
The outbreak of the [[First World War]] diverted attention from these matters. The [[New Zealand general election, 1914|1914 election]] left Massey and his political opponents stalemated in parliament, with neither side possessing enough support to govern effectively. Massey reluctantly invited [[Joseph Ward]] of the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberals]] to form a war-time coalition, created in 1915. While Massey remained Prime Minister, Ward gained de facto status as joint leader. Massey and Ward travelled to Britain several times, both during and after the war, to discuss military co-operation and peace settlements. During his first visit, Massey visited New Zealand troops, listening to their complaints sympathetically. This angered some officials, who believed that Massey undermined the military leadership by conceding (in contrast to the official line) that conditions for the troops were unsatisfactory. The war reinforced Massey's strong belief in the British Empire and New Zealand's links with it. He attended the Peace Conference in 1919 and signed the [[Treaty of Versailles]] on behalf of  New Zealand.  Although turning down knighthoods and a peerage, he accepted appointment as a Grand Officer of the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)]] from the King of Belgium in March 1921 and a Grand Officer of the [[Legion of Honour]] by the President of France in October 1921.&lt;ref&gt;M. Brewer, 'New Zealand and the Légion d'honneur: Officiers, Commandeurs and Dignites', The Volunteers: The Journal of the New Zealand Military Historical Society, 35(3), March 2010, p.136.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coalition with the Liberals====

[[File:Massey and Ward.jpg|thumb|Massey and Ward, {{circa|1920}}]]
Partly because of the difficulty in obtaining consensus to implement meaningful policies, the coalition government had grown increasingly unpopular by the end of the war. Massey was particularly worried by the rise of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], which was growing increasingly influential. Massey also found himself fighting off criticism from within his own party, including charges that he was ignoring rural concerns. He dissolved the coalition in 1919, and fought both the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberals]] and [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] on a platform of patriotism, stability, support for farmers, and a public works program. He successfully gained a majority.

===The Red Scare===

According to New Zealand historian Tony Wilson, Massey was known for his anti-[[Bolshevik]] and anti-Soviet sentiments. He disliked domestic socialist elements like the "Red Feds", the predecessor to the [[New Zealand Council of Trade Unions|New Zealand Federation of Labour]], and the [[New Zealand Labour Party]].  As Prime Minister, Massey was opposed to Communist influence. He regarded the [[Red Terror]] (1919–20) in the [[Soviet Union]], which followed the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917, as proof of the "inherently oppressive orientation" of socialism. In response to the Red Scare the government passed the War Regulations Continuance Act, which continued wartime emergency regulations including censorship. This led to a ban on Communist-oriented literature, which continued to 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Tony|editor-first=Alexander |editor-last=Trapeznik |title=Lenin's Legacy Down Under |publisher=Otago University Press|year=2004|pages=101–02 |chapter=Chapter 6: Defining the Red Menace|isbn=1-877276-90-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1922 election===

Economic problems lessened support for Reform. In the [[New Zealand general election, 1922|1922 election]] Massey lost his majority, and was forced to negotiate with independents to keep his government alive. He was also alarmed by the success of Labour, which was now only five seats behind the Liberals. He began to believe that the Liberals would eventually disappear, with their supporters being split, the socially liberal wing to Labour and the economically liberal wing to Reform. He set about trying to ensure that Reform's gain would be the greater.

In 1924 cancer forced him to relinquish many of his official duties, and the following year he died. The [[Massey Memorial]] was erected as his [[mausoleum]] in Wellington, paid for mostly by public subscription. [[Massey University]] is named after him, the name chosen because the university had a focus on [[agricultural science]], matching Massey's own farming background.

==Honours==
* {{Flag|France}}: [[Image:Legion Honneur GO ribbon.svg|80px]] [[Grand Officer]] of the [[Legion of Honour]]
* {{Flag|Belgium}}: [[Grand Officer]] of the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]]

==Family==
His widow, [[Christina Allan Massey|Christina]], was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|GBE]] in 1926, one year after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/overview/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804214234/http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/overview/history.html |archivedate=4 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of his sons became Reform MPs: [[Jack Massey (politician)|Jack]] (1885–1964), who represented his father's [[Franklin (New Zealand electorate)|Franklin electorate]] from 1928 to 1935, and from 1938 to 1957 for National; and [[Walter William Massey|Walter William]] (1882–1959), who represented [[Hauraki (New Zealand electorate)|Hauraki]] from 1931 to 1935.

Neoi Prasinoi ({{lang-el|Νέοι Πράσινοι}}, Young Greens) is a non-partisan political youth organization in Greece, a member of the [[Federation of Young European Greens]], consisting of ecologically and politically restless youngsters. The Federation of Young European Greens is the Youth Wing of the [[European Green Party]].

==History &amp; Aims==
Neoi Prasinoi were founded by young members of the [[Ecologist Greens]] in January 2008, rather than by the party itself. Neoi Prasinoi have entered a transitional period in July 2014 with the direct election of the temporary Coordination Committee, mandated with the realization of the decisions of the 15th of July. These decisions included reforming Neoi Prasinoi into a non-partisan political youth in Greece, as well as the preparation of a Statute for Neoi Prasinoi. The term of the temporary Coordination Committee ended at the 1st Conference of Neoi Prasinoi, which adopted the Statute and elected a Coordination Committee with a full term. Neoi Prasinoi are to this day the only non-partisan political youth in Greece, a pioneering endeavour in itself.

Neoi Prasinoi fight climate change and strive for the protection of the environment, animal rights and the sustainability of our societies, without sidelining social liberties, non-violence, [[paideia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/paideia|title=paideia|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; racism and the rule of law, social justice and democracy

Neoi Prasinoi aim at change through the changing of mentalities and behaviours in our daily lives. They seek to collectively support new models of social relations, far more ecological and with more solidarity. As part of the green movement, they strive to change political choices and priorities, along with the other emancipation.
