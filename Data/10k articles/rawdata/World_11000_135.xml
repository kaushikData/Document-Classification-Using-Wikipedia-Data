'''''Abouna''''' ({{lang-ar|أبون}}, English: "Our Father") is a 2002 film by [[Chad]]ian director [[Mahamat Saleh Haroun]]. It was filmed on location in [[Gaoui]] and [[N'Djamena]], Chad. It was the [[List of Chadian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Chadian submission]] for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[75th Academy Awards]] but was not nominated.

== Plot ==
Two boys (Tahir and Amine) awake one morning to find that their father has abandoned their family.  Shocked, they begin to misbehave.  While surreptitiously watching a movie, they think they see their father speaking to them and steal the film to examine the frames.  Their mother (Achta) eventually despairs and sends them to Koranic school.  Unhappy, they plan their escape until the eldest boy falls in love with a deaf girl (Khalil).

== Casting and production ==
Ahidjo Mahamat Moussa, who played the 15-year-old Tahir, was offered a choice of boys to play his younger brother Amine.  He eventually chose eight-year-old Hamza Moctar Aguid because he felt that Aguid could really be his brother.

After each day for shooting, film was sent 2600 miles to [[Paris]] for processing. Only after waiting several days, when word came back that there were no problems, would shooting resume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/cinema/features/abouna.shtml ''Abouna''] by Josh Hillman, [[BBC Four]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
The film won the following awards:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0307913/awards Awards], [[IMDB]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2002 [[Hong Kong International Film Festival]]: Firebird Award – Special Mention

'''"Anna rakkaudelle tilaisuus"''' ("Give love a chance") was the [[Finland|Finnish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978]], performed in [[Finnish Language|Finnish]] by [[Seija Simola]].

The song was performed fourth on the night, following [[Italy]]'s [[Ricchi e Poveri]] with "[[Questo amore]]" and preceding [[Portugal]]'s [[Gemini (Portuguese band)|Gemini]] with "[[Dai li dou]]". At the close of voting, it had received two points, placing 18th in a field of twenty.

The song is sung to a boy growing up. Simola tells him that, while everything in the world seems new and exciting at the moment, it will soon seem not so. Thus, he must learn to "give love a chance" in order to remain positive. Simola also recorded the song in English under that title; "Give Love a Chance".

It was succeeded as [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Finnish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979 Contest]] by [[Katri Helena]] with "[[Katson sineen taivaan]]".

The '''Baptist Union of Poland''' (or ''Union of Christian Baptists'') is an association of [[Baptist]] churches in the country of [[Poland]].

Modern Baptist work began in Poland in 1844. The first typical Polish congregation was formed in the village of Zelow in 1872. Polish Baptists adopted the ''German Baptist Confession of 1847'' as their own confession.

In 1922, the ''Union of Slavic Baptists in Poland'' was formed, and the ''Union of the Baptist Churches of the German Language'' was formed in 1928. The unions of German-speaking and Polish-speaking Baptists existed until [[World War II]], when they were forced into a merger with other [[evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] bodies. After 1947, the Baptists emerged as a small separate body. The ''Baptist Union of Poland'' is a member of the [[European Baptist Federation]] and the [[Baptist World Alliance]]. As of 2014, there were 83 Baptists churches with about 5,204 members in Poland, overwhelmingly a Catholic country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebf.org/ukraine-a-baptist-church-for-every-5000-inhabitants Ukraine: A Baptist Church for Every 5,000 Inhabitants]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sabbath Day Christian Church'' is a [[Seventh Day Baptists|Seventh Day Baptist]] body that exists independently of the Union. 

The Biblical Theological Seminary in Wrocław, now an interdenominational work, was started by the Baptist Union in 1990.

'''Charles I''' (28 March 1468 [[Carignano]], [[Piedmont]] &amp;ndash; 13 March 1490 [[Pinerolo]]), surnamed '''the Warrior''', was the Duke of Savoy from 1482 to 1490 and titular [[Kingdom of Cyprus|king of Cyprus]], [[Kings of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], and [[Monarchs of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenia]] from 1485 to 1490.

He was son of [[Amadeus IX, Duke of Savoy]] and [[Yolande of Valois]], daughter of king [[Charles VII of France]].

Charles was related in two ways to the childless Queen [[Charlotte of Cyprus]], titular Queen of Armenia and Jerusalem. Not only was she his father Amadeus' first cousin, in such a way that her rights would naturally descend to this line, but also she was the widow of Charles's paternal uncle Louis of Savoy, Count of Geneva (d. 1482).  Charlotte however was without a kingdom, having been exiled in the 1460s from her own legitimate kingdom of Cyprus by her illegitimate half-brother.

This double relationship would serve Charles well, as in 1485, when he was 17, she surrendered her rights in Cyprus, Armenia, and Jerusalem to young Charles, her next legitimate heir in line from King [[Janus of Cyprus]] and Armenia. The kingdom itself was held by the [[republic of Venice]], but the [[House of Savoy|Savoy dynasty]] continued to claim it.

==Family==
He married [[Blanche of Montferrat|Blanche Palaiologina]] (Bianca di Montferrato) (1472&amp;ndash;1519), daughter of [[William VIII, Marquess of Montferrat]], who after Charles's death was the regent of the Duchy of Savoy from 1490 to 1496. They had two surviving children.

#[[Yolande Louise of Savoy]] (1487&amp;ndash;1499), married [[Philibert II of Savoy]].
#[[Charles John Amadeus of Savoy]] (1489&amp;ndash;1496).

'''''Ego Dominus Tuus''''', Latin for "I am your lord," sometimes translated as "I am your master" is a poem by the Irish poet [[William Butler Yeats]].  It was published in the 1918 book ''Per Amica Silentia Lunae'', where it introduced some of Yeats's essays, and collected with other poems in  ''[[The Wild Swans at Coole]]'' (1919).  The title is taken from [[Dante]]'s ''[[La Vita Nuova]]'': the words "ego dominus tuus" are spoken to Dante in a dream by the personification of Love. The two characters of the poem, ''Hic'' and ''Ille'', are [[Latin]] words meaning ''this man'' and ''that man'', respectively. [[Ezra Pound]] identified ''Ille'' with 'Willie', or Yeats: the poem covers many characteristic themes of Yeats, in particular the image of the mask and the concept of the double or "anti-self". The dialogue of ''Hic'' and ''Ille'' treats the poetry of Dante, [[John Keats]], and Yeats himself, contrasting the words of each poet with the experience of their lives.

'''Elizabeth Marchant Truswell''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|FAA}} (also known as Elizabeth Kemp) is a former Chief Scientist at the [[Australian Geological Survey Organization|Australian Geological Survey Organisation]] and is known for her application of recycled [[Palynology|palynomorph]] distribution as an indicator of sub-ice geology.

==Early life and education==
Truswell was born in [[Kalgoorlie]], Western Australia and completed a BSc (Hons) at the [[University of Western Australia]] in 1962.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.science.org.au/learning/general-audience/history/interviews-australian-scientists/dr-elizabeth-truswell-geologist|title=Dr Elizabeth Truswell, geologist|year=2000|website=''science.org.au''|publisher=Australian Academy of Science|access-date=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 she received a British Commonwealth Scholarship to undertake a PhD at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], UK.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was awarded her PhD in 1966 on the geological history of flowering plants as demonstrated by the pollen record.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eoas.info/biogs/P003648b.htm|title=Australian Academy of Science – Corporate entry – Encyclopedia of Australian Science|last=Centre|first=The University of Melbourne eScholarship Research|website=eoas.info|access-date=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, she completed a Visual Arts degree with Honours at the School of Art, [[Australian National University]] (ANU), focusing on the role of the artists who accompanied the early explorers to Antarctica.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/audio/transcripts/NMA_E_Truswell_LMW_20140815.html|title=Landmark women: Elizabeth Truswell|website=nma.gov.au|publisher=National Museum of Australia|access-date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and impact==

=== Research ===
Truswell's career has focused on the field of [[palynology]], with a large part devoted to understanding [[Antarctica]]'s floral history. She developed several novel methods for investigating sub-ice geology via the distribution of recycled pollen spores, leading to her election as a [[Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science]] in 1985.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.science.org.au/fellowship/fellows/dr-elizabeth-truswell|title=Fellows|website=''science.org.au''|publisher=Australian Academy of Science|access-date=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a postdoctoral researcher at [[Florida State University]], US (1971–1973), Truswell participated in the first Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP) voyages to Antarctica,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deepseadrilling.org/28/dsdp_toc.htm|title=DSDP Vol. 28 Table of Contents|website=''deepseadrilling.org''|access-date=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which still holds the record for the furthest south of such drilling. This voyage contributed to a new understanding of the age of the Antarctic ice sheet and the development of an early version of the [[Antarctic Convergence]]. Subsequent work on [[Ocean Drilling Program]] material led her, along with M.K. Macphail, to decipher an unparalleled pollen record from [[Prydz Bay]], revealing the composition of terrestrial plant communities during the earliest stages of ice-cap formation during the Late Eocene preglacial-glacial transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-odp.tamu.edu/publications/188_SR/188TOC.HTM|title=188 Scientific Results Table of Contents|website=www-odp.tamu.edu|access-date=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Truswell returned to Australia in 1973 to begin a career with the Bureau of Mineral Resources (now [[Geoscience Australia]])&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; holding the position of Chief Research Scientist from 1990 to 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0673b.htm|title=Truswell, Elizabeth Marchant – Woman – The Encyclopedia of Women and Leadership in Twentieth-Century Australia|last=Melbourne|first=The University of|website=womenaustralia.info|access-date=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time her work focused not only on the evolutionary and geological history of the Antarctic continent, but also on the past climatic conditions of Australia and applying the geological record to inform understanding of modern climate change. She was also a member of Australia's Antarctic Advisory Committee (1992–1998) and a board member of the first Antarctic Cooperative Research Centre in Hobart, the Antarctic Climate &amp; Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre.

Truswell has been involved in several [[UNESCO]] projects. Her first involvement was with the UNESCO Earth Science program (1991–1999), which aimed to help young Australian scientists to take part in projects with people from developing countries. Since 2006 she has served on the Australian National Committee for the International Geoscience Co-operation (IGCP), which is part of the UNESCO [[International Geoscience Programme|International Geosciences Programme]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/SC/pdf/IGCP_NatComReport_Australia_2015.pdf|title=Annual Report – Australia|year=2015|website=|publisher=IGCP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artwork ===
In 2000 Truswell shifted her emphasis towards the interface between science and the arts, with particular reference to Antarctica. During her time as a visiting fellow in the Research School of Earth Sciences at the Australia National University, she undertook a degree in visual arts at the School of Art.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rses.anu.edu.au/people/elizabeth-truswell|title=Dr Elizabeth Truswell|date=10 January 2014|website=Research School of Earth Sciences|access-date=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her artworks are held in a number of collections in Australia and Europe, including, in Canberra, at the ANU and at Geoscience Australia. She has exhibited in solo exhibitions at the ANCA Gallery in Canberra, CSIRO Discovery Centre, the Goldfields Regional Gallery, Kalgoorlie, and the ANU School of Art Gallery. Her public outreach has included talks and radio broadcasts (e.g. ABC Radio National, ''The Science Show''), [[University of the Third Age|U3A]] lectures on Art and Science in Early Antarctic Exploration, and published papers in academic and popular literature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2158">'''En''' or '''Enji''' ({{IPA-sq|ɛɲi|}}) is the [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] god&lt;ref name="Lurker"/&gt; of [[fire god|fire]].&lt;ref name="Tagliavini"&gt;{{harvnb|Tagliavini|1963|p=103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The name continues to be used in the [[Albanian language]] for [[Thursday]] (''enjte'').

==History==
According to [[Karl Treimer]], [[Illyrians]] worshiped a [[fire god]] named *Enji, related to the [[Vedic]] fire god [[Agni]].&lt;ref name="Tagliavini"/&gt;

With the coming of [[Christianity]] En was demoted to demonic status.&lt;ref name="Lurker"/&gt; The name En continues to be used in the [[Albanian language]] to refer to [[Thursday]] ({{lang-sq|enjte}}, {{lang-als|enjtë}}, {{lang-aln|êjte}}).&lt;ref name="Lurker"&gt;{{harvnb|Lurker|2005|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tagliavini"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name ''enjte'' continues [[Proto-Albanian language|Proto-Albanian]] *''agni-'', probably related to the archaic [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] word for '[[fire]]' ([[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*h₁n̥gʷnis''). The names of week days in Albanian are the translation of [[Latin]] names, so the word ''enjte'' translates the Latin word ''lovis diem'', and ''enj-'' must be the [[Albanian mythology|Albanian]] equivalent of [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Orel|1998|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It offers two economic zones in [[Massawa]] and [[Assab]], both coastal cities. The Free Zones were announced in 2001, and later nominally opened in September 2006. The Authority is currently under the supervision of CEO [[Araya Tsegay]].

The Massawa Free Zone offers access to the [[Massawa International Airport]], as well as seaport access. Furthermore, it includes a container terminal and processing facilities.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shaebia.org/artman/publish/article_4849.html|title=Dr. Araya Tsegay, CEO of the Eritrean Free Zone Authority|accessdate=2007-03-05}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The port will also have access to the rail link, and mining operations became operational in 2008 in central Eritrea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article19827|title=Eritrean steam dream of rail link with Sudan|accessdate=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assab Free Zone offers the [[Assab International Airport]], as well as seaport access. It also contains a salt processing facility and an oil refinery.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;

Further expansions of the Free Zones Authority are planned, as they become viable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1466">[[File:Testaccio - fontana delle anfore 1220105.jpg|thumb|Fontana delle Anfore]]
The '''Fontana delle Anfore''' (English: ''Fountain of the Amphorae''), located in [[Testaccio]], a quarter of [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. It was completed in 1927, by [[Pietro Lombardi (architect)|Pietro Lombardi]] after he won a competition the municipality of Rome set in 1924 for new local [[fountain]]s. The motive of the [[Amphora|amphorae]] refers to the [[Monte Testaccio]] and to the symbol of the whole quarter.

It was initially in ''Piazza Testaccio'' (at that time it was called ''Piazza Mastro Giorgio''), but was moved to ''Piazza dell'Emporio'' in the mid-1930s. After the closure of the old Testaccio market in 2012, ''Piazza Testaccio'' was converted to an open space, reopening in January 2015, with the restored fountain again at its centre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="640">'''Gebeleizis''' (or ''Gebeleixis'', ''Nebeleizis'') was a god worshiped by the [[Getae]], probably related to the [[Thracians|Thracian]] god of storm and lightning, [[Zibelthiurdos]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomashek, ''Die Alten Thraker'', II, page 62&lt;/ref&gt; He was represented as a handsome man, sometimes wearing a beard. The lightning and [[thunder]] were his manifestations. According to [[Herodotus]], some [[Getae]] equated Gebeleizis with [[Zalmoxis]] as the same god.

The '''International Association of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions''' (commonly known as AICESIS), an association under Dutch law, is established in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] and has been founded on 1 July 1999, in [[Port Louis]], [[Mauritius]].

The AICESIS members are economic and social Councils, i.e. consultative institutions, including organizations representing the social partners (employers, [[trade unions]]) and other stakeholders of [[civil society]]. These are essential components of [[participatory governance]] in modern societies.

National Councils that are active members of AICESIS are autonomous bodies with national competence, drawing their authority from the [[constitution]], the [[law]], the [[decree]] or of any other mode of official recognition by public authorities and benefiting on their own of a real representativity of economic, social and environmental interests.

AICESIS is developing fast. In its initial composition, the AICESIS had 27 members. In 2015, AICESIS registered 72 countries from four continents: [[Africa]], [[Asia]] – [[Eurasia]] - [[Middle East]], [[Europe]] and [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]].

==History==

The AICESIS creation was launched at the initiative of the President of the [[French Economic, Social and Environmental Council|Economic and Social Council]] of [[France]], [[Jean Matteoli]], and the President of the Economic and Social Council of [[Ivory Coast]], [[Philippe Yacé]], in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]] in 1997.

On July 2, 1999, in [[Port Louis]] ([[Mauritius]]), the Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions participants unanimously approved the founding Articles of AICESIS. These Articles were subsequently modified by the General Assemblies of [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], in September 2006, and of [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], in June 2012.

==Missions==

Mainly acting as a network, the three main Association's objective is, with full respect towards the independence of each of its members, are:

* To develop cooperation between its members, by promoting exchange of experiences and good practices,
* To promote [[social dialogue]] and [[participatory democracy]] at a wider level, 
* To encourage and support the creation of ESCs in countries which do not yet possess them in accordance with the principles of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], as well as the fundamental principles and rights at work endorsed by all members of the [[International Labour Organization]].

==Functioning==

===Composition===

To date, the AICESIS has 72 members, including 62 ordinary members, 6 associate members and 4 observers.

AICESIS has 4 governing bodies:

-	The ''General Assembly'' meets once a year in one of the member countries. It is sovereign and takes at an absolute majority all the important decisions for the AICESIS life.

-	The ''Board of Director''s manages the Association. It meets as often as the President or two Board members consider it desirable, usually twice a year. The Board of Directors is composed of eighteen members. They are appointed by the General Assembly for 2 years, taking into account a balanced geographical distribution (currently three representatives for [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], six representatives for [[Africa]], five representatives [[Europe]], three representatives for [[Asia]] - [[Eurasia]] - [[Middle East]]).

-	The ''President'' is the President of a Council or Institution full member of the AICESIS. He is appointed for two years, according to a principle of rotation on a continental basis, by the General Assembly. With the Board of Directors, the President has the responsibility to manage the AICESIS. He represents the Association and chairs the Board of Directors and the General Assembly.

-	The ''General Secretariat'' is composed by a Secretary-General, elected by the General Assembly on the Board proposal for four years, Deputy Secretaries-General (one per continent) appointed by the Board for two years, an Administrator, and project managers. The Secretary-General is a permanent position at the Association, he manages the day to day AICESIS functioning, as well as the execution of missions and the monitoring of decisions. He prepares the medium term development plan of the Association, implements the decisions taken by the General Assembly and the Board, prepares and manages the budget. Finally, with the President, he ensures the representation of the AICESIS.

===Funding===

The AICESIS budget is essentially based on contributions from its members, the amount being determined by the General Assembly.

However, the Association also receives in-kind contributions from some members. Thus, according to their means, most of them strive for participating in the AICESIS expenses, for instance by holding and supporting expenditure related to a meeting organisation (conference, working group meetings, general assembly, board, etc.).

===Works===

The AICESIS medium-term development plan identifies the following priorities: 
* Improve the internal governance by increasing information and transparency in the decision making process and the involvement of members; 
* Develop information and communication;
* Strengthen partnerships with international organizations: [[ILO]], [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC), [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] (UNDESA); 
* Improve cooperation and exchange of experiences between members on concrete issues; 
* Assist in the creation of ESCs in the world.

Each year, the AICESIS General Assembly decides the priority working topics for the Association. The working methods, organized by the General Secretariat, ensure that the work is accessible to all members.

Every Presidency of the Association suggests to the Assembly a main working theme. Previously, the AICESIS working themes focused on "[[Globalization]] of world trade and its consequences" (2000); "Fighting poverty through [[sustainable development]]: towards a partnership approach" (2003); "Creating an environment conducive to generating decent and productive employment and its impact on [[sustainable development]], including sustained [[economic growth]] and poverty eradication" (2006); "Intensifying international cooperation, promoting joint development and building a harmonious world" (2007) ; "The role of ESCs/SIs in the new economic, social and environmental world [[governance]]" (2011); "Promoting the employment and socio-professional integration of young people: what are the new issues and what role can organized civil society play?" (2013); "National human capital and new sources of national competitiveness" (2015).

Since 2007, the AICESIS gives the AICESIS [[Millennium Development Goals]] Awards. The first ones were given by the President of [[Brazil]], Mr. [[Lula Da Silva]] in November 2007 in [[Brasilia]] ([[Brazil]]) to pay tribute to [[civil society organizations]] and public institutions that have undertaken noteworthy initiatives for Education ([[MDG]] 2). The second awards were given in July 2011 in [[Rome]] ([[Italy]]), with the participation of the President of the [[Italian Republic]], Mr. [[Giorgio Napolitano]], to noteworthy initiatives undertaken for women empowerment ([[MDG]] 3). The third awards were be given in September 2013 in [[Algiers]] ([[Algeria]]) to [[civil society organizations]] that have undertaken initiatives for the achievement of the [[MDGs]] 1 and 8 “full employment, decent and productive work for poverty reduction”. The last edition will be organized in September 2015 in [[Moscow]] ([[Russia]]) to reward ESCs/SIs for their actions promoting the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]].

Since 2009, AICESIS organized every two years, the International Summer School for young people starting their career in an ESC, a SI, a member organization of these institutions, or just involved in the [[social dialogue]] in their country. The first edition was held in August 2009 in [[Noordwijk]] ([[Netherlands]]) on "The ESCs in a globalized world." The second edition was held in [[Shanghai]] ([[China]]) in September 2012 on "The ESCs and [[sustainable development]]". The third one was organized in September 2015 in [[Kabardino-Balkaria]] ([[Russia]]) on "International cooperation between Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions in favor of global development."

Moreover, the AICESIS has developed a global database that lists all the economic and social Councils, similar Institutions or social dialogue institutions that exist around the world

Also, the AICESIS publishes a monthly electronic newsletter available in six languages: [[English language|English]], [[Arabic]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].

===Relations with other international organisations===

At its 44th plenary meeting, on 10 October 2001, the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC),&lt;ref&gt;Decision 2001/318 adopted by the Economic and Social Council at its resumed substantive session of 2001 (10 October 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; having considered the application of the International Association of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions, decided, in accordance with rule 79 of the rules of procedure of the Council, that the organization might participate on a continuing basis, without the right to vote, in the deliberations of the Council on questions within the scope of its activities. Thus, the AICESIS has granted permanent observer status with general competences, under [[intergovernmental organization]] (IGO).This enables it to intervene, alongside representatives of governments and [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), to express the views of ESCs/SIs at the ECOSOC annual high-level segment.

In November 2006, the [[Officers of the Governing Body]] of the [[ILO]]&lt;ref&gt;Decision GB.297/20/4 adopted by the Governing Body during the 297th session (2–17 November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; have considered the question of the representation of the International Association of Economic and Social Councils and Similar Institutions at ILO meetings, and vice versa. Having noted that the Director-General has received assurance that the ILO would be invited to all the AICESIS meetings of interest to it, the Officers recommend that the Governing Body permanently authorize the [[Director-General]] to invite the AICESIS to be represented at the annual sessions of the Conference and at other [[ILO]] meetings in which it has a technical interest, including meetings of the Governing Body at which issues of concern to the AICESIS are to be discussed. Thus each year, the AICESIS intervenes as an IGO, at the International Labour Conference, alongside representatives of governments and [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), and expresses the views of ESCs/SIs.

In May 2012, the AICESIS and the [[ILO]] signed a cooperation agreement. The [[ILO]] and AICESIS have organized many joint conferences in this context (12–13 October 2010 in [[Cotonou]], [[Benin]]: The role of ESCs in the implementation of the [[Global Jobs Pact]]; 12–14 April 2011 in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]: The role of ESCs regarding public strategies and policies for employment and implementation of the global jobs pact; 10–11 November 2011 in [[Santo Domingo]], [[Dominican Republic]]: [[Latin America]] regional seminar on "The role of ESCs in [[social dialogue]]"; 8–9 May 2012 in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]: [[social protection floor]]; 3–4 December 2013 in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]: The role of ESCs in the response to the global financial, economic and jobs crisis; 20–21 November 2014 in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]: social protection floors for all).

Finally, thanks to the experience of the [[European Economic and Social Committee]] (EESC) and the [[Union of Economic and Social Councils of Africa]] (UCESA), the AICESIS seeks to promote regional integration process and all forms of dialogue between economic and social actors in the North and South, East and West.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26911">The topic of [[Ancient iron production|early iron metallurgy]] in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] encompasses both studies of the technology and archaeology  of indigenous iron production, and also an understanding of the role that iron production played in African societies before [[colonial Africa|European colonization]].

[[Iron smelting]] was practiced by the [[Nok culture]] of [[Nigeria]] from as early as 1000 BC.
The nearby [[Djenné-Djenno]] of the [[Niger River|Niger Valley]] between [[Mali]] and [[Nigeria]] shows evidence of iron production from c. 250 BC. The technology was spread by the [[Bantu expansion]] to Eastern and Southern Africa during c. 500 BC to AD 400 as shown in the [[Urewe]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;K.

Although the origins of iron working in Africa have been the subject of scholarly interest since the 1860s, it is still not known whether this technology diffused into sub-Saharan Africa from the Mediterranean region, or whether it was invented there quite independently of iron working elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Alpern, S. B. (2005) Did they or didn’t they invent it? Iron in sub-Saharan Africa.  ''History in Africa'' 32:41-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some nineteenth-century European scholars favored an indigenous invention of iron working in sub-Saharan Africa, archaeologists writing between 1945 and 1965 mostly favored diffusion of iron smelting technology from [[Carthage]] across the Sahara to West Africa, or from [[Meroe]] on the upper Nile to central Africa, or both.&lt;ref&gt;van der Merwe, N. J. 1980.  The advent of iron in Africa.  In ''The Coming of the Age of Iron'', eds. T. S. Wertime, J.D. Muhly, pp. 463-506.  New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of [[radiocarbon dating]] in the late 1950s made it possible to date metallurgical sites in sub-Saharan Africa (since the fuel used for smelting and forging was always charcoal) and by the late 1960s some surprisingly early radiocarbon dates had been obtained for iron smelting sites in both Nigeria and central Africa (Rwanda, Burundi).  This led some scholars to state that iron was independently invented in sub-Saharan Africa&lt;ref&gt;Trigger, B. G. (1969).  The myth of Meroe and the African Iron Age.  ''International Journal of African Historical Studies'' 2 :23-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diop, C.A. (1976). L’usage du fer en Afrique. ''Nyame Akuma'' 53:93-95.&lt;/ref&gt; The same findings weakened the diffusion hypothesis (at least for those sites in Sub-Saharan Africa for which such early dates had been obtained), as there was no firm evidence at that time for the antiquity of ironworking in either Carthage or Meroe. Evidence of early Phoenician iron smelting in the western Mediterranean (900–800 BC) was not found until the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Descoeudres, E. Huysecom, V. Serneels and J.-L. Zimmermann (editors) (2001) ''The Origins of Iron Metallurgy: Proceedings of the First International Colloquium on The Archaeology of Africa and the Mediterranean Basin/Aux Origines de la Métallurgie du Fer: Actes de la Première Table Ronde Internationale d’Archéologie (L’Afrique et le Bassin Méditerranéen''). Special Issue of the journal  ''Mediterranean Archaeology'' (volume 14)&lt;/ref&gt; and it is still not known when iron working was first practiced in Kush and Meroe in modern Sudan.

From the mid-1970s there were new claims for independent invention of iron smelting on central Niger&lt;ref&gt;Quéchon, G. and  J.-P. Roset (1974). Prospection archéologique du massif du Termit (Niger). Cahiérs ORSTOM, Série Sciences Humaines 11:85-104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grébénart, D. (1985). ''La Region d'In Gall-Tegidda n Tesemt (Niger), Programme Archéologique d'Urgence 1977–1981. II: Le Néolithique Final et les Débuts de la Métallurgie.'' Niamey: Institut de Récherches en Sciences Humaines (Études Nigeriennes, no. 49).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paris, F., A. Person, G. Quéchon and J.-F. Saliège (1992). Les débuts de la métallurgie au Niger septentrional (Aïr, Azawagh, Ighazer, Termit). Journal de la Société des Africanistes 62:55-68.&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1994–1999 UNESCO funded an initiative "Les Routes du Fer en Afrique/The Iron Routes in Africa" to investigate the origins and spread of iron metallurgy in Africa. This funded both the conference on early iron in Africa and the Mediterranean&lt;ref&gt;Descoeudres at al. 2001 (above)&lt;/ref&gt; and a volume, published by UNESCO, that has generated much controversy because it included only authors sympathetic to the view that iron was independently invented in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Bocoum, H. (ed.) 2004 ''The Origins of Iron Metallurgy in Africa: New Light on Its Antiquity – West and Central Africa''. Geneva:UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major reviews of the evidence were published in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Killick, D.J. (2004) Review Essay. What do we know about African iron working? ''Journal of African Archaeology'' 2(1):97-112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alpern 2005 (above)&lt;/ref&gt; Both authors concluded that there were major technical flaws in each of the studies claiming independent invention.  Three major issues were identified. The first was whether the material dated by radiocarbon was in secure archaeological association with iron-working residues. (Many of the dates from Niger, for example, were on organic matter in potsherds that were lying on the ground surface together with iron objects). The second issue is the possible effect of "old carbon": wood or charcoal much older than the time at which iron was smelted. This is a particular problem in Niger, where the charred stumps of ancient trees are a potential source of charcoal, and have sometimes been mis-identified as smelting furnaces. A third issue is the inherent lack of precision of the radiocarbon method itself in the range from 800 to 400 BC, which is attributable to irregular production of radiocarbon in the upper atmosphere. Unfortunately most radiocarbon dates for the initial spread of iron metallurgy in sub-Saharan Africa fall within this range.

Controversy flared again with the publication of excavations by Étienne Zangato and colleagues of their excavations in the Central African Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Zangato, E. (2007) ''Les Ateliers d’Oboui: Premières Communautés Métallurgistes dans le Nord-Ést du Centrafrique''. Paris: Editions Recherche sur les Civilisations (ERC).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zangato, E. and Holl, A.F.C. (2010) ‘On the iron front: new evidence from Central Africa’, Journal of African Archaeology 8:7-23.&lt;/ref&gt; At the site of Oboui they excavated an undated iron forge, for which they obtained eight consistent radiocarbon dates of 2000 BC.  This would make Oboui the oldest iron working site in the world, and more than a thousand years older than any other dated evidence of iron in Central Africa.  Opinion among African archaeologists is sharply divided. Some accept this interpretation, but it has also been suggested that Oboui is a highly disturbed site, with older charcoal having been brought up to the level of the forge by the digging of pits into older levels &lt;ref&gt;Clist, B. (2012) Vers une réduction des prejugés et la fonte des antagonisms: un bilan de l’expansion de la métallurgie du fer en Afrique sud-Saharienne,  ''Journal of African Archaeology'' 10:71-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Questions have also been raised about the unusually good state of preservation of metallic iron from the site.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, H. 2009. Seeking Africa's first iron men.  ''Science'' 323:200-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, there is no proof that iron working technology was taken across the Sahara into sub-Saharan Africa; nor is there proof of independent invention.  Given the multitude of potential problems with radiocarbon dating in the first millennium BC, archaeologist trying to date the earliest African metallurgy need to make routine use of [[luminescence dating]] of the baked clay from smelting furnaces.

Even though the origin(s) of iron smelting are difficult to date by radiocarbon, there are fewer problems with using it to track the spread of ironworking after 400 BC. In the 1960s it was suggested that iron working was spread by speakers of [[Bantu languages]], the original homeland of which has been located by linguists in the Benue River valley of eastern Nigeria and Western Cameroon. Although it has been proposed that no words for iron or ironworking can be traced to reconstructed [[Proto-Bantu language|proto-Bantu]],&lt;ref&gt;de Maret, P and F. Nsuka (1977) History of Bantu metallurgy: some linguistic aspects. ''History in Africa'' 4:43-65&lt;/ref&gt; the toponymy in West Africa such as Ilorin suggest otherwise (short for Okuta Ilorin, literally meaning the site of Iron-Work).  The linguist Christopher Ehret argues that the first words for iron-working in Bantu languages were borrowed from Central Sudanic languages, probably somewhere in the vicinity of modern Uganda and Kenya,&lt;ref&gt;Ehret, C. (2000) The establishment of iron-working in Eastern, Central and South Africa: linguistic Inferences on technological history. ''Sprache ind Geschichte in Afrika'' 16/7:125-176.&lt;/ref&gt; while Jan Vansina&lt;ref&gt;Vansina, J. (2006) Linguistic evidence for the introduction of ironworking into Bantu-speaking Africa. History in Africa 33: 321-361.&lt;/ref&gt; argues instead that they originated in non-Bantu languages in Nigeria, and that iron metallurgy spread southwards and eastwards to speakers of Bantu languages, which had already dispersed into the Congo rainforest and into the Great Lakes region.   Whichever of these interpretations is correct, the archaeological evidence clearly indicates that iron and cereal agriculture (millet and sorghum) spread together from southern Tanzania and northern Zambia, starting in the first century BC,  all the way south to the eastern Cape region of present South Africa, which was reached by the third of fourth century AD&lt;ref&gt;Killick, D. (2014) Cairo to Cape: the spread of metallurgy through eastern and southern Africa. In ''[[Archaeometallurgy]] in Global Perspective: Methods and Syntheses'', edited by Ben Roberts and Christopher Thornton, pp. 507-528. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems highly probable that both iron metallurgy and cereal agriculture were spread through this vast area by migrations of people speaking Bantu languages.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Techniques ==
All indigenous African iron smelting processes are variants of the [[bloomery]] process.  A much wider range of bloomery smelting processes has been recorded on the African continent than elsewhere in the Old World, probably because bloomeries remained in use into the 20th century in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, whereas in Europe and most parts of Asia they were replaced by the  [[blast furnace]] before most varieties of bloomeries could be recorded. W.W. Cline's compilation of eye-witness records of bloomery iron smelting over the past 250 years in Africa&lt;ref&gt;Cline, W.W. (1937) ''Mining and Metallurgy in Negro Africa''.  Menasha, WI: George Banta&lt;/ref&gt; is invaluable, and has been supplemented by more recent ethnoarchaeological and archaeological studies. Furnaces used in the 19th and 20th centuries ranges from small bowl furnaces, dug down from the ground surface and powered by [[bellows]], through bellows-powered shaft furnaces up to 1.5 m tall, to 6.5m natural-draft furnaces (i.e. furnaces designed to operate without bellows at all). The truly remarkable variety of African bloomery furnaces presumably reflects local adaptations to particular ores, ecological conditions and social circumstances, such as abundance or shortage of labour.

Over much of tropical Africa the ore used was [[laterite]], which is widely available on the old continental [[cratons]] in West, Central and Southern Africa. Magnetite sand, concentrated in streams by flowing water, was often used in more mountainous areas, after [[beneficiation]] to raise the concentration of iron. Precolonial iron workers in present South Africa even smelted iron-titanium ores that cannot be used by modern blast furnaces.This is because titanium oxide is not reduced in bloomeries, and mixes readily with iron and silica to produce fluid slags. In the blast furnace titanium oxide is partially reduced and makes the calcium-magnesium-silica-alumina slags sticky, so that they cannot be drained from the furnace.&lt;ref&gt;Killick, D.J. and D. Miller (2014). Smelting of magnetite and magnetite-ilmenite ores in the northern Lowveld, South Africa, ca. 1000 CE – ca.1880 CE.  ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 43:239-255.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomery furnaces were less productive than blast furnaces, but were far more versatile.

The fuel used was invariably charcoal, and the products were the bloom (a solid mass of iron) and [[slag]] (a liquid waste product).  African ironworkers regularly produced inhomogeneous steel blooms, especially in the large natural-draft furnaces.  The blooms invariably contained some entrapped slag, and after removal from the furnace had to be reheated and hammered to expel as much of the slag as possible. Semi-finished bars of iron or steel were widely traded in some parts of West Africa, as for example at [[Sukur]] on the Nigeria-Cameroon border, which in the nineteenth century exported thousands of bars per year north to the Lake Chad Basin.&lt;ref&gt;David, N. (editor) ''Metals in Mandara Mountains Society and Culture''. Trenton, NJ: Africa World Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many African ironworkers produced steel blooms, there is little evidence in sub-Saharan as yet for hardening of steel by [[quenching]] and tempering. or for the manufacture of composite tools combining a hard steel cutting edge with a soft but tough iron body. Relatively little [[metallography]] of ancient African iron tools has yet been done, so this conclusion may perhaps be modified by future work.

Unlike bloomery iron-workers in Europe, India or China, African metalworkers did not make use of water power to blow bellows in furnaces too large to be blown by hand-powered bellows.  This is partly because sub-Saharan Africa has much less potential for water power than these other regions, but also because there were no engineering techniques developed for converting rotary motion to linear motion. African ironworkers did however invent a way to increase the size of their furnaces, and thus the amount of metal produced per charge, without using bellows. This was the natural-draft furnace, which is designed to reach the temperatures necessary to form and drain slag by using a chimney effect – hot air leaving the topic of the furnace draws in more air through openings at the base. (Natural-draft furnaces should not be confused with wind-powered furnaces, which were invariably small). The natural-draft furnace was the one African innovation in ferrous metallurgy that spread widely.&lt;ref&gt;Killick, D. J. (1991) A little known extractive process: iron smelting in natural-draft furnaces.  ''JOM (Journal of the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society'') 43(4):62-64.&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural draft furnaces were particularly characteristic of African savanna woodlands, and were used in two belts – across the Sahelian woodlands from Senegal in the west to Sudan in the east, and in the ''Brachystegia-Julbenardia'' (miombo) woodlands from southern Tanzania south to northern Zimbabwe. The oldest natural-draft furnaces yet found are in Burkina Faso and date to the seventh/eight centuries &lt;ref&gt;Serneels, V., Donadini, F., Kiénon-Kaboré, H.T., Koté, L.,Kouassi, S.K., Ramseyer, D. and Simporé, L.

''Schweizerisch-Liechtensteinische Stiftung für Archäologische Forshungen I'm Ausland (SLSA), Annual Report 2013'':65-112.&lt;/ref&gt; The large masses of slag (10,000 to 60,000 tons) noted in some locations in Togo, Burkina Faso and Mali reflect the great expansion of iron production in West Africa after 1000 AD that is associated with the spread of natural-draft furnace technology.&lt;ref&gt;Robion-Brunner C.

''Africa'' 56:148-174.&lt;/ref&gt; But not all large scale iron production in Africa was associated with natural draft furnaces – those of Meroe (Sudan, first to fifth centuries AD) were produced by slag-tapping bellows-driven furnaces,&lt;ref&gt;Shinnie, P.L. and F.J. Kense (1982) Meroitic iron working, in: N.B. Millet, A.L. Kelley (Eds.)

(1979). A nineteenth-century Ruhr in central Africa. ''Africa'' 49:329-351.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the large-scale iron smelting recorded so far are in the Sahelian and Sudanic zones that stretch from Senegal in the west to Sudan in the east; there were no iron-smelting concentrations like these in central or southern Africa.

These techniques are now extinct in all regions of sub-Saharan Africa, except for some very remote regions of Ethiopia.  In most regions of Africa they fell out of use before 1950.  The main reason for this was the increasing availability of iron imported from Europe.  Blacksmiths still work in rural areas of Africa to make and repair agricultural tools, but the iron that they use is imported, or recycled from old motor vehicles.

== Uses ==
Iron was not the only metal to be used in Africa; [[copper]] and [[brass]] were widely utilised too. However the steady spread of iron meant it must have had more favourable properties for many different uses. Its durability over copper meant that it was used to make many tools from farming pieces to weaponry. Iron was used for personal adornment in [[jewelry]], impressive pieces of artwork and even instruments. It was used for coins and currencies of varying forms. For example, kisi pennies; a traditional form of iron currency used for trading in West Africa. They are twisted iron rods ranging from &lt;30&amp;nbsp;cm to &gt;2m in length. Suggestions for their uses vary from marital transactions, or simply that they were a convenient shape for transportation, melting down and reshaping into a desired object. There are many different forms of iron currency, often regionally differing in shape and value. Iron did not replace other materials, such as stone and wooden tools, but the quantity of production and variety of uses met were significantly high by comparison.

== Social and cultural significance ==
It is important to recognize that while iron production had great influence over Africa both culturally in trade and expansion (Martinelli, 1993, 1996, 2004), as well as socially in beliefs and rituals, there is great regional variation. Much of the evidence for cultural significance comes from the practises still carried out today by different African cultures. Ethnographical information has been very useful in reconstructing the events surrounding iron production in the past, however the reconstructions could have become distorted through time and influence by anthropologist's studies.

The Iron Age of Africa was based around the agricultural revolution, driven by the use of iron tools. Tools for cultivation and farming made production far more efficient and possible on much larger scales. Fishing hooks, arrow heads and spears aided hunting. Iron weapons also influenced warfare. These items, in addition to the production of other iron goods helped stimulate economic activity, the rise of [[chiefdoms]] and even states. The control of iron production was often by ironworkers themselves, or a "central power" in larger societies such as kingdoms or states (Barros 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;154).&lt;ref&gt;de Barros, P., 2000. "Iron Metallurgy: Sociocultural Context". J. O. (ed.) ''Ancient African Metallurgy, The Socio- Cultural Context''. England: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers Inc, pp. 147–198&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for trade is believed to have resulted in some societies working only as smelters or smiths, specialising in just one of the many skills necessary to the production process. It is possible that this also led to tradesmen specialising in transporting and trading iron (Barros 2000, pg152). However, not every region benefited from industrialising iron production, some suffered environmentally from problems that arose due to the massive deforestation required to provide the charcoal for fuelling furnaces (for example the ecological crisis of the Mema Region (Holl 2000, pg48)).

Iron smelters and [[Blacksmith|smith]]s received different social status depending on their culture. Some were lower in society due to the aspect of manual labour and associations with witchcraft, for example in the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] (Childs et al. 2005 pg 288). In other cultures the skills are often passed down through family and would receive great social status (sometimes even considered as witchdoctors) within their community. Their powerful knowledge allowed them to produce materials on which the whole community relied. In some communities they were believed to have such strong supernatural powers that they were regarded as highly as the king or chief. For example, an excavation at the royal tomb of King Rugira (Great Lakes, Eastern Africa) found two iron [[anvil]]s placed at his head (Childs et al. 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;288 in Herbert 1993:ch.6), suggesting their importance and powerful significance. In some cultures mythical stories have been built around the premise of the iron [[smelter]] emphasising their godlike significance.

== Rituals ==
The smelting process was often carried out away from the rest of the community. Ironworkers became experts in rituals to encourage good production and to ward off bad spirits, including song and prayers, plus the giving of medicines and even sacrifices. The latter are usually put in the furnace itself or buried under the base of the furnace. Examples of these date back as far as the early Iron Age in [[Tanzania]] and [[Rwanda]] (Schmidt 1997 in Childs et al., 2005 p.&amp;nbsp;293).&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, P.R., 1997. ''Iron Technology In East Africa. Symbolism, Science and Archaeology''. Oxford, James Currey Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cultures associated sexual symbolism with iron production. Smelting is integrated with the fertility of their society, as with natural reproduction the production of the bloom is compared to the conception and birth. There are many strict taboos surrounding the process. The smelting process is carried out entirely by men and often away from the village. For women to touch any of the materials or be present could jeopardise the success of the production.  The furnaces are also often extravagantly adorned to resemble a woman, the mother of the bloom.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

'''''Jazz Mama''''' is a [[documentary]] film.

== Synopsis ==
Jazz Mama is both a film and a movement inspired by the uncompromising strength and dignity of Congolese women despite the obstacles and violence they face. Jazz Mama aims to bring awareness to [[gender based violence]] in Congo without reducing the women to victims whose lives are circumscribed by [[rape]], but instead to recognize that, while [[sexual violence]] is indeed a devastating problem, these women are often not only survivors but the pillars of the community.

"The rape of the land, the mutilation of the flesh." La femme Congolaise - courageous and industrious despite the vicissitudes and the turbulence of life. She continues to fight for herself, taking on professions previously reserved for men. More often than not she must pay her children’s school fees and compensate for her husband who is either underpaid, unemployed, or absent.
She sells kikwembe at Zando market; she is an engineer repairing electronics on the corner of the street, she is a designer, a stylist, minister, or teacher.
Demonstrating their incredible strength and their faith in their ability to continue their own advancement, these women stand strong in their communities even as they denounce the rape and the violence they experience.

"Both earth and mother, she is the foundation, like [[Kinshasa]] herself, scorned and beloved."

'''Kitchen Budapest''' (KiBu) is an innovation lab based in [[Budapest, Hungary]]. It was founded in 2007 by a collective of media artists, theoreticians and coders from miscellaneous backgrounds with sponsorship from [[Magyar Telekom]]. Founder team includes [[Adam Somlai-Fischer]], [[Peter Halacsy]], [[Robin Nagy]], [[Attila Nemes]], and [[Eszter Bircsák]]. As one of the first media labs in Hungary, KiBu found its primary mission to instigate digital literacy and DIY techniques on the local scene. Ever since, KiBu has been actively present as an internationally recognized innovation lab with young researchers and developers forming its team.

KiBu incorporates three functions including research and development ([[Prototype|prototyping]], testing, [[service design]], [[Unix|UX]]/[[User interface|UI]] design), education (next generation programs as [http://apply.kibu.hu Talent and Lift]) and industry collaboration.

KiBu has taken up a strong intermediary role between several agencies, scenes and individuals. It connects corporate demands with creative supplies, theoretic bias of academic education with tools of the [[maker culture]], talented young people with professional support, global innovation with situated, everyday use. KiBu has long been working within an international network of media labs and bears established contacts with the local universities integrating technical knowledge with creative skills.

KiBu is a place where ideas come alive. Material instantiations of great ideas are the first steps in the making: via 24 hour [[hackathon]]s, pressure cooking sessions they try and test methodologies, concepts, objects, services. KiBu has a well-equipped workshop area to enable wide-ranging projects to be manufactured, programmed or constructed from [[3D printing|3D printers]] to strong server parks to run high fidelity renders. The prototypes are publicized at Demo Day, the biannual showcase event.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1114">The '''Kvikne Copper Works''' at [[Kvikne]] in [[Hedmark]], Norway were operated from 1630, and were the largest copper works in Norway in the mid-17th century. The ore discovery was reported in 1629. The first mines were called ''Gabe Gottes'' and ''Segen Gottes''. ''Gabe Gottes'' collapsed in 1677, and in 1682 the copper works suffered severe economic losses as a ship's load of copper was taken by pirates. In 1789 the mines were largely damaged by the flooding disaster [[Storofsen]], and this virtually ended the operation of the mines. During the first 150 years of operation about 6,960 tons of refined [[copper]] were produced from the mines at Kvikne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kvikne Kobberverk |url=http://www.kvikne.no/OmKvikne/KvikneKobberverk/tabid/17435/Default.aspx |publisher=kvikne.no |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''one hundred lei''' banknote is one of the circulating denomination of the [[Romanian leu]]. It is the same size as the [[Euro banknotes|100 Euro banknote]].

The main color of the banknote is blue. It pictures, on the obverse the playwright, short story writer, poet, theater manager, political commentator and journalist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], and on the reverse the old building of the [[National Theatre Bucharest|Bucharest National Theatre]], and the [[Statue of Ion Luca Caragiale (Bucharest)|statue of Ion Luca Caragiale]]. The one hundred lei banknote is the only banknote that pictures both on the obverse and reverse a personality.

The modern name of Latvia is thought to originate from the ancient Latvian name [[Latvia|Latvji]], which may have originated from the word [[Latve]] which is a name of the river that presumably flowed through what is now eastern Latvia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

'''Peter Valentinovich Turchin''' ({{lang-ru|Пётр Валенти́нович Турчи́н}}; born 1957) is a [[Russians|Russian]]-[[United States|American]] [[scientist]], specializing in cultural evolution and "[[cliodynamics]]"—[[mathematical modeling]] and [[statistical analysis]] of the dynamics of historical societies.

== Biography ==
Turchin was born in [[Obninsk]], Russia, in 1957 and in 1964 moved to [[Moscow]]. In 1975 he entered the Faculty of Biology of the [[Moscow State University]] and studied there until 1977, when his father, the [[Soviet dissidents|Soviet dissident]] [[Valentin Turchin]], was exiled from the USSR. He got his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[biology]] from the [[New York University]] (cum laude) in 1980 and [[Ph.D.]] in [[zoology]] in 1985 from [[Duke University]].

Peter Turchin is a professor at the [[University of Connecticut]] in the Department of [[Ecology]] and [[Evolutionary Biology]] as well as in the Department of [[Anthropology]] and in the Department of [[Mathematics]]. He is the vice president of the [[Evolution Institute]].

Peter Turchin has made contributions to population ecology, cultural evolution, and historical dynamics. He is one of the founders of [[cliodynamics]], the new scientific discipline at the intersection of [[macrosociology|historical macrosociology]], [[cliometrics]], and mathematical modeling of social processes. Turchin developed an original theory explaining how large historical empires evolve by the mechanism of [[multilevel selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turchin |first1=P |year=2009 |title=A Theory for Formation of Large Empires |url=http://peterturchin.com/PDF/Turchin_JGH_2009.pdf |journal=Journal of Global History |volume=4 |issue=|pages=191–207 |doi=10.1017/s174002280900312x}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research on [[Social cycle theory|secular cycles]]&lt;ref name="Turchin2006"&gt;Turchin P. and [[Korotayev]] A. 2006. [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/files/seh/2006_2/population_dynamics_and_internal_warfare.pdf Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration]. ''[[Social Evolution &amp; History]]'' 5(2): 112–147; Turchin P. and Nefedov S. 2009. [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8904.html Secular Cycles]. [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; has contributed to our understanding of the [[Societal collapse|collapse of complex societies]] as has his re-interpretation of [[Ibn Khaldun]]'s [[asabiyya]] notion as "collective solidarity".&lt;ref name="Turchin2003"&gt;{{citation |last=Turchin |first=P. |title=Historical Dynamics: Why States Rise and Fall |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location= |isbn= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urss.ru"&gt;Korotayev A.V., Khaltourina D.A. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=165&amp;Itemid=70 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends in Africa''.] Moscow: URSS, 2006. {{ISBN|5-484-00560-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of special importance is his study of the [[hypothesis]] that [[population]] pressure causes increased [[warfare]]. This hypothesis has been recently criticized on empirical grounds. Studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare. Turchin, in collaboration with [[Korotayev]], has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Turchin2006" /&gt; Population and warfare are dynamical variables. If their interaction causes sustained oscillations, then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time (that is, unlagged). Turchin and Korotayev have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare (focusing on internal warfare) might be in stateless and state societies. Next, they tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies: early modern England, Han and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] China, and the [[Roman Empire]]. Their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory: Turchin and Korotayev have found that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in phase (with warfare peaks following population peaks). Furthermore, they have demonstrated that the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory: population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity, while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density.&lt;ref name="Turchin2006" /&gt;

== Publications ==
Turchin has published over 200 scientific articles (including more than a dozen in ''Nature'', ''Science'', or ''PNAS'') and at least seven books.

The '''South Asian Regional Trade Union Council (SARTUC)''' is a [[federation]] of [[national trade union center]]s whose geographic scope covers South Asia. SARTUC's mission is to promote workers' rights within its member nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurn.info/topic/trade/icftu_0604.pdf International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. ''The Spread of Bilateral and Regional Trade Agreements.''

The South Asian Regional Trade Union Council was formed in January 1988 by some of the affiliates of the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (now the [[ITUC]]) in countries belonging to the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC)—[[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The Indian trade union center [[Indian National Trade Union Congress]] and [[Hind Mazdoor Sabha]], were the founding members of SARTUC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-old.itcilo.org/actrav/english/calendar/2001/A3_2380/work/Country_reports/india.doc Pijush Chakraborty.

'''''The Life of Hunger''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Biographie de la faim'''}}) is a novel by Belgian author [[Amélie Nothomb]]. It was first published in 2004.

==Resume==
"The inhabitants of Vanuatu have never been hungry." They don't know the feelings that hunger causes as everything is within their reach. As a result, they become idle.
Amélie exists in a permanent state of starvation. She tries by any means to overcome the emptiness which defines her (see [[The Character of Rain]]). She intoxicates herself by observing the World's beauty; the hills beyond her Japanese garden, her sister's beauty, the gentleness of her nanny's hugs, the drunken rush from races, or an internal journey into emptiness.

'''Villa Erba''' is a 19th-century villa in [[Cernobbio]], on the shores of [[Lake Como]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Villa Erba|url=http://www.visit-comolake.com/altolario/en/alto-lario/ville-e-giardini/villa-erba|publisher=Visit Como Lake|accessdate=15 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140511163322/http://www.visit-comolake.com/altolario/en/alto-lario/ville-e-giardini/villa-erba|archive-date=11 May 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built by Luigi Erba, brother of the prominent businessman Carlo Erba (founder of the first Italian pharmaceutical company), to show off his wealth.

After the death of Luigi Erba, the villa was inherited by his daughter Carla and was used by members of Carla's family, including her son [[Luchino Visconti]]. In 1986, it was bought by a public [[consortium]] to use as an exposition and congress center.

In 2004, the villa served as a filming location for the movie ''[[Ocean's Twelve]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OCEANS 12 - Production notes - About the production|url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=2807|publisher=CinemaReview.com|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2005, American singer [[Gwen Stefani]], shot the [[music video]] for her 2005 [[Single (music)|single]], ''[[Cool (Gwen Stefani song)|Cool]]'', on the villa's grounds. In the same year, a leg of [[Anastacia]]'s ''[[Live at Last Tour]]'' was hosted in the villa's park.
