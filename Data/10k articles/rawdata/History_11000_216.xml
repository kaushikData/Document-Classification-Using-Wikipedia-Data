'''Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve''' (October 23, 1831{{snd}}January 9, 1924) was an American [[classics|classical scholar]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to Emma Louisa Lanneau (daughter of Bazille Lanneau and Hannah Vinyard) and [[Benjamin Gildersleeve]] (1791–1875). His father was a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]], and editor of the Charleston ''Christian Observer'' from 1826 to 1845, of the Richmond (VA) ''Watchman and Observer'' from 1845 to 1856, and of ''The Central Presbyterian'' from 1856 to 1860. His maternal Grandfather was Bazile Lanneau, one of the many [[Acadians|French Acadians]] that were [[Expulsion_of_the_Acadians|forcibly expelled by the British]] from present day [[Nova Scotia]] during the [[French and Indian War]]. His maternal Grandmother was Hannah Vinyard.  He graduated from [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in 1849 at the age of eighteen, and went on to study under [[Johannes Franz]] in Berlin, under [[Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl|Friedrich Ritschl]] at [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] and under [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schneidewin]] at [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], where he received his Ph.D. in 1853. Upon returning to the United States, he was offered a position as a Classics professor at Princeton, but he turned it down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leitch|first1=Alexander|title=Gildersleeve, Basil Lanneau|url=https://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/gildersleeve_basil_lanneau.html|publisher=[[Princeton University]]|accessdate=February 13, 2018|date=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1856 to 1876 he was professor of [[Greek language|Greek]] at the [[University of Virginia]], holding the chair of [[Latin]] also from 1861 to 1866.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Gildersleeve, Basil Lanneau|volume=12|pages=12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married September 18, 1866 in [[Middlebury, Virginia]] to Eliza Fisher Colston.

After service for the [[Confederate States Army]] in the [[American Civil War]], during which Gildersleeve was shot in the leg, he returned to the University of Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhu.edu/gazette/2000/sep1800/18greek.html|title=Hopkins History: First Greek Prof, Basil Gildersleeve|last=Stimpert|first=James|date=September 18, 2000|work=The Johns Hopkins Gazette|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ten years later, he accepted an offer from [[Daniel Coit Gilman]] to teach at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref name="GildersleeveBriggs1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve|author2=Ward W. Briggs|title=Soldier and Scholar: Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve and the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BlXxEVcAzQYC|year=1998|publisher=University of Virginia Press|isbn=978-0-8139-1743-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, the ''[[American Journal of Philology]]'', a quarterly published by the Johns Hopkins University, was established under his editorial charge, and his strong personality was expressed in the department of the ''Journal'' headed "Brief Report" or "Lanx Satura," and in the earliest years of its publication every tiny detail was in his hands. His style in it, as elsewhere, is in striking contrast to that of the typical classical scholar, and accords with his conviction that the true aim of scholarship is "that which is." He published a ''Latin Grammar'' (1867; revised with the co-operation of [[Gonzalez B. Lodge]], 1895 and 1899; reprinted 1997 with a bibliography of twentieth-century work on the subject)&lt;ref name="GildersleeveLodge1903"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve|author2=Gonzalez Lodge|title=Gildersleeve's Latin Grammar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qngXAAAAIAAJ|year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''Latin Series'' for use in secondary schools (1875), both marked by lucidity of order and mastery of grammatical theory and methods. His edition of [[Aulus Persius Flaccus|Persius]] (1875) is of great value.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

But his bent was rather toward Greek than Latin. His special interest in [[Koine Greek|Christian Greek]] was partly the cause of his editing the ''Apologies'' of [[Justin Martyr]] (1877), which claimed to have "used unblushingly as a repository for [his] syntactical formulae." Gildersleeve's studies under Franz had no doubt quickened his interest in Greek [[syntax]], and his [[logic]], untrammeled by previous categories, and his marvelous sympathy with the language were displayed in this most unlikely of places. His ''Syntax of Classic Greek'' (Part I, 1900, with [[CWE Miller]]) collects these formulae. Gildersleeve edited in 1885 ''The Olympian and Pythian Odes of [[Pindar]]'', with a brilliant and valuable introduction. His views on the function of grammar were summarized in a paper on ''The Spiritual Rights of Minute Research'' delivered at [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]] on June 16, 1895. His collected contributions to literary periodicals appeared in 1890 under the title ''Essays and Studies Educational and Literary''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
[[File:Grave of Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A gravestone.|Gildersleeve's gravestone at the [[University of Virginia Cemetery]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].]]
He was elected [[List of Presidents of the American Philological Association|president of the American Philological Association]] in 1877 and again in 1908 and became a member of the [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters|American Academy of Arts and Letters]] as well as of various learned societies.  He received the honorary degree of LL.D. from [[College of William and Mary|William and Mary]] (1869), [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (1896), [[Yale University|Yale]] (1901), [[University of Chicago|Chicago]] (1901), and [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] (1911); D.C.L. from the [[Sewanee, The University of the South|University of the South]] (1884); L.H.D. from Yale (1891) and Princeton (1899); Litt.D. from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (1905).

Gildersleeve retired from teaching in 1915. He died on January 9, 1924 and was buried at the [[University of Virginia Cemetery|University of Virginia cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSsr=281&amp;GScid=647092&amp;GRid=39924973&amp;df=p&amp;|title=Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve (1831 - 1924) - Find A Grave Memorial|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Gildersleeve House, one of the undergraduate dormitories at Johns Hopkins, and Gildersleeve Portal, of Brown Residential College at the University of Virginia, are both named in his honor. His granddaughter [[Katherine Lane Weems]] made the two rhinoceros sculptures at [[Harvard University]].

The University of Virginia's Classics program also offers a [[Professors in the United States#Distinguished (teaching / research) professor|distinguished professorship]] in Gildersleeve's honor. It is currently held by [[Anthony Corbeill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthony Corbeill|url=http://classics.virginia.edu/people/profile/apc3m|publisher=[[University of Virginia]]|accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Humiston Kelley''' (April 1, 1924 in [[Albany, New York]] – May 19, 2011)&lt;ref name=Globe&gt;{{cite web |title=David Humiston Kelley |url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/Deaths.20110523.93265489/BDAStory/BDA/deaths|work=Globe and Mail |accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] American [[archaeologist]] and [[epigraphy|epigrapher]], most noted for his work on the phonetic analysis and major contributions toward the decipherment of the [[writing system]] used by the [[Maya civilization]] of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], the [[Maya script]].

==Work and interests==
David Kelley was a descendant of [[Amos Humiston]], a [[Union Army]] soldier who was killed at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in 1863.

He graduated from [[Harvard University]] with a PhD. in 1957.  From the late 1950s, he was one of the first [[Mayanist]] scholars to give credence to the theories of the Russian linguist and ethnographer [[Yuri Knorozov]] concerning the [[Phonemic orthography|phonetic]] and [[Syllabary|syllabic]] nature of the Maya script, which would later lead to breakthroughs in the script's decipherment. Kelley's landmark 1962 paper, ''Phoneticism in the Maya Script'', would provide important corroborating data of the phonetic interpretation of Maya glyphs, which ran counter to the then-prevailing view that the script lacked phonetic elements.

In addition to his work on scripts and linguistics, he worked on calendrics and [[archaeoastronomy]], particularly on application of archaeoastronomical data to the Maya calendar correlation problem.&lt;ref name="atlanticconference"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlanticconference.org/2009/bioKelley.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601050013/http://www.atlanticconference.org/2009/bioKelley.html |archivedate=2010-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://morris.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/whose-father-was-he-part-four/ | work=The New York Times | title=Whose Father Was He?

He was also interested in long-range cultural contacts, including trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic voyages ("[[Diffusionism]]").

He also published frequently on mediaeval and ancient genealogies, publishing papers on the Carolingians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David. H. |last=Kelley |title=A New Consideration of the Carolingians |journal=[[New England Historic Genealogical Society#The New England Historical and Genealogical Register|The New England Historical and Genealogical Register]] |volume=101 |year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Jewish Exilarchs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=David H. |last=Kelley |url=http://fmg.ac/MGR/Sources/S-00002710.htm |title=The Political Role of Solomon, the Exilarch, c. 715–759 CE |journal=Foundations (Foundation for Medieval Genealogy) |volume=2 |year=2006 |issue=1 and 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Nibelungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=David H. |last=Kelley |url=http://fmg.ac/FMG/Journal/01-06.htm |title=The Nibelungs |journal= Foundations (Foundation for Medieval Genealogy)|volume=1 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Society of Genealogists]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fasg.org/fellows/all-fellows/ American Society of Genealogists: All Fellows.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelley was a [[professor emeritus]] in the Department of Archaeology at the [[University of Calgary]]. Before teaching at the University of Calgary, he taught during the 1960s at the University of Nebraska, and before that at Texas Tech. Studying under Alfred M. Tozzer,&lt;ref name="atlanticconference" /&gt; his doctoral dissertation (1957) at Harvard was entitled "Our Elder Brother Coyote".

[[File:Aboriginal art Carnarvon Gorge.jpg|thumb|300px|Stencil art at [[Carnarvon Gorge]], supposedly showing "unique clan markers and dreamtime stories symbolising attempts to catch the deceased's spirit."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}]]

'''Dreamtime''' (also '''dream time''', '''dream-time''') is a term devised by early anthropologists to refer to a religio-cultural worldview attributed to [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|Australian Aboriginal beliefs]]. It was originally used by [[Francis James Gillen|Francis Gillen]], quickly adopted by his colleague [[Walter Baldwin Spencer|Baldwin Spencer]] and thereafter popularised by [[A. P. Elkin]], who, however, later revised his views. The Dreaming is used to represent Aboriginal concepts of "time out of time," or "everywhen," during which the land was inhabited by ancestral figures, often of heroic proportions or with supernatural abilities. These figures were often distinct from "gods" as they did not control the material world and were not [[worship|worshipped]], but only [[reverence (emotion)|revered]]. The concept of the dreamtime has subsequently become widely adopted beyond its original Australian context and is now part of global popular culture.

The term is based on a rendition of the indigenous ([[Arandic languages|Arandic]]) word ''[[altjira|alcheringa]]'', used by the [[Aranda people|Aranda (Arunta, Arrernte) people]] of [[Central Australia]], although it has been argued that it is based on a misunderstanding or mistranslation. [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|William Stanner]] remarked: "why the blackfellow thinks of 'dreaming' as the nearest equivalent in English is a puzzle".{{sfn|Price-Williams|1987|p=249}} Some scholars suggest that the word's meaning is closer to "[[Apeiron (cosmology)|eternal, uncreated]]."{{sfn|Swain|1993|p=21}}

By the 1990s, "Dreamtime" and "the Dreaming" had acquired their own currency in [[popular culture]], based on idealised or fictionalised conceptions of Australian mythology. Since the 1970s, "Dreaming" and "Dream time" have also returned from academic usage via popular culture and [[tourism in Australia|tourism]] and are now ubiquitous in the English vocabulary of indigenous Australians in a kind of "[[Self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling academic prophecy]]".{{sfn|Swain|1993|p=21}}{{efn|Stanner warned about uncritical use of the term and was aware of its semantic difficulties, while at the same time he continued using it and contributed to its popularisation; according to Swain it is "still used uncritically in contemporary literature".{{cn|date=July 2018}}}}

==Origin of the term==
The station-master, magistrate and amateur ethnographer Francis Gillen first used the terms in an ethnographical report in 1896. With Baldwin Spencer Gillen, he published in 1899 a major work, ''Native Tribes of Central Australia''.{{sfn|James|2015|p=36}} In that work, they spoke of the ''Alcheringa'' as "the name applied to the far distant past with which the earliest traditions of the tribe deal".{{sfn|Spencer|Gillen|1899|p=73 n.1,645}}{{efn|"the dim past to which the natives give the name of the 'Alcheringa'." (p.119)}} Five years later, in their ''Northern tribes of central Australia'', they gloss the far distant age as "the dream times", link it to the word ''alcheri'' meaning "dream", and affirm that the term is current also among the [[Kaytetye|Kaitish]] and [[Anmatyerre|Unmatjera]].{{sfn|Spencer|Gillen|1904|p=745}}

Early doubts about the precision of this English gloss were expressed by the German [[Lutheran]] pastor and missionary [[Carl Strehlow]], who noted that his native informants explained ''[[altjira]]'', whose etymology was unknown, as an eternal being who had no beginning. In [[Upper Arrernte language|the Arrernte tongue]], the proper verb for "to dream" was ''altjirerama'', i.e., "to see god". The noun is the somewhat rare word ''altjirrinja'', of which Spencer and Gillen gave a corrupted transcription and a false etymology. "The native," they concluded, "knows nothing of 'dreamtime' as a designation of a certain period of their history."{{sfn|Hill|2003|pp=140–141}}{{efn|The Strehlows' informant for this, Moses (''Tjalkabota''), was a convert to Christianity, and the adoption of his interpretation suffered from a methodological error, according to [[Barry Hill (Australian writer)|Barry Hill]], since his conversion made his views on pre-contact beliefs unreliable.}}

== Aboriginal beliefs and culture ==
[[File:Ku-ring-gai Chase - petroglyph.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ku-ring-gai Chase-petroglyph, via Waratah Track, depicting [[Baiame]], the Creator God and Sky Father in the dreaming of several Aboriginal language groups.]]
[[File:Bibbulmun Track Markings.jpg|thumb|200px|Waugals (yellow triangles with a black snake in the centre) are the official [[Bibbulmun Track]] trailmarkers between [[Kalamunda]] and [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] in Western Australia. The Noongar believe that the Waugal, or Wagyl, created the Swan River and is represented by the Darling scarp.]]

Related entities are known as ''Mura-mura'' by the [[Diyari|Dieri]] and as ''Tjukurpa'' in [[Pitjantjatjara language|Pitjantjatjara]].

"[[Dreaming (spirituality)|Dreaming]]" is now also used as a term for a system of totemic symbols, so that an indigenous Australian may "own" a specific "Dreaming", such as Kangaroo Dreaming, or Shark Dreaming, or Honey Ant Dreaming, or Badger dreaming or any combination of Dreamings pertinent to their country.
This is because in "Dreamtime" an individual's entire ancestry exists as one, culminating in the idea that all worldly knowledge is accumulated through one's ancestors. Many Indigenous Australians also refer to the Creation time as "The Dreaming". The Dreamtime laid down the patterns of life for the Aboriginal people.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica}}

Creation is believed to be the work of culture heroes who travelled across a formless land, creating [[Aboriginal sacred site|sacred sites]] and significant places of interest in their travels. In this way, "[[songline]]s" (or ''Yiri'' in the [[Warlpiri language]]{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}) were established, some of which could travel right across Australia, through as many as six to ten different language groupings.
The dreaming and travelling trails of the Spirit Beings are the songlines. The signs of the Spirit Beings may be of spiritual essence, physical remains such as petrosomatoglyphs of body impressions or footprints, among natural and elemental simulacra.

"Dreaming" existed before the life of the individual begins, and continues to exist when the life of the individual ends. Both before and after life, it is believed that this spirit-child exists in the Dreaming and is only initiated into life by being born through a mother. The spirit of the child is culturally understood to enter the developing [[fetus]] during the fifth month of pregnancy.{{sfn|Bates|1996}} When the mother felt the child move in the womb for the first time, it was thought that this was the work of the spirit of the land in which the mother then stood. Upon birth, the child is considered to be a special custodian of that part of their country and is taught the stories and [[songlines]] of that place. As Wolf (1994: p.&amp;nbsp;14) states: "A black 'fella' may regard his totem or the place from which his spirit came as his Dreaming. He may also regard tribal law as his Dreaming."

In the [[Wangga]] genre, the songs and dances express themes related to death and regeneration.{{sfn|Marett|2005|p=1}} They are performed publicly with the singer composing from their daily lives or while Dreaming of a ''nyuidj'' (dead spirit).{{sfn|Povinelli|2002|p=200}}

Dreaming stories vary throughout [[Australia]], with variations on the same theme. The meaning and significance of particular places and creatures is wedded to their origin in the Dreaming, and certain places have a particular potency or "dreaming." For example, the story of how the sun was made is different in [[New South Wales]] and in [[Western Australia]]. Stories cover many themes and topics, as there are stories about creation of sacred places, land, people, animals and plants, law and custom. In [[Perth]], the ''[[Noongar]]'' believe that the [[Darling Scarp]] is the body of the ''[[Wagyl]]'' – a serpent being that meandered over the land creating rivers, waterways and lakes and who created the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In another example, the ''[[Gagudju]]'' people of [[Arnhemland]], for which [[Kakadu National Park]] is named, believe that the sandstone escarpment that dominates the park's landscape was created in the Dreamtime when ''Ginga'' (the crocodile-man) was badly burned during a ceremony and jumped into the water to save himself.

==In popular culture==
An early reference is found is [[Richard McKenna]]'s 1960s speculative fiction novella, ''[[Fiddler's Green (1967 novelette)|Fiddler's Green]]'', which mentions "Alcheringa... the Binghi spirit land", i.e. the Aranda concept translated as "Dream time".
Early 1970s references to the concept include [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s novella ''[[The Word for World is Forest]]'' (1972) and [[Peter Weir]]'s films ''[[The Last Wave]]'' (1977) and ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' (1975).

"Dreamtime" became a widely cited concept in popular culture in the 1980s, and by the late 1980s was adopted as a cliché in [[New Age]] and [[feminist spirituality]] alongside related appeals to other "[[noble savage|Rouseauian natural people]]", such as the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] idealized in 1960s [[History of the hippie movement|hippie counterculture]].{{sfn|di Leonardo|2000|p=377 n.42}}

'''Dropmore Park''' and '''Dropmore House''' are located along Dropmore Road, north of [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire]], England, and is about {{convert|220|acre}} in size. The park with its buildings have Grade I [[listed building]] status. It is one of the most important buildings in south Bucks.&lt;ref name ="BBC"/&gt;

==Location==
It is located in the [[Thames Valley]] near to the wood known as [[Burnham Beeches]]. It is about {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} west of the centre of London and about {{convert|3|mi|km|1}} south of junction 2 of the [[M40 motorway]] and about {{convert|4|mi|km|1}} north of junction 7 of the [[M4 motorway]]. The nearest main towns are [[High Wycombe]], [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], [[Maidenhead]] and [[Slough]]. Close neighbouring grand estates and [[stately homes]] include [[Cliveden]] and [[Hedsor House]]. The house and estate are not normally open to members of the public.

==History==
[[File:Neale(1818) p1.106 - Dropmore, Buckinghamshire.jpg|thumb|right|Dropmore in 1818]]
Dropmore House was built in the 1790s for [[William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]], who later as [[Prime Minister]] pushed through the law abolishing the slave trade.&lt;ref name = "BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title = Abolitionist's house escapes ruin - BBC news 1 April 2007|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6433573.stm|accessdate = 2009-02-06 | date=2007-04-01 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architect was [[Samuel Wyatt]]. [[Charles Heathcote Tatham|Charles Tatham]] was architect for changes in the 19th century.&lt;ref name = "CRCMHS"/&gt;

Grenville knew the spot from rambles during his time at [[Eton College]], and prized its distant views of his old school and of [[Windsor Castle]]. On his first day in occupation, he planted two cedar trees. At least another 2,500 trees were planted. By the time Grenville died in 1834, his [[pinetum]] contained the biggest collection of [[conifer]] species in Britain. Part of the restoration is to use what survives as the basis for a collection of some 200 species.&lt;ref name = "BBC"/&gt;

In 1945, after wartime use during which it was harshly treated, the house was restored by [[Viscount Kemsley]], the proprietor of [[The Sunday Times]]. He filled it with paintings, furniture and books. After his death in 1968 it was sold to [[United States International University]] and then to the Ambassador of the [[United Arab Emirates]], Muhammed Mahdi al-Tajir.

An indoor pool was added, but the house was rarely used. In 1990 it was badly damaged by a fire that took four days to put out. Another in 1997 left the house uninhabitable.&lt;ref name = "CRCMHS"&gt;{{cite web|title = Canadian Red Cross Memorial Hospital Shrine website with pages showing Dropmore from the other side of the fence after the fires|url = http://www.crcmh.com/dropmore.htm|accessdate = 2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dropmore was restored by the company Corporate Estates via the construction firm MP Brothers Limited into a number of private luxury dwellings&lt;ref name = "STimes"&gt;{{cite news|title = Grand manor in Buckinghamshire for sale - Sunday Times 28 February 2008|url = http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/buying_and_selling/article3453260.ece|accessdate = 2009-02-06 | location=London | work=The Times | first=Marcus | last=Binney | date=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dropmore PE"&gt;{{cite web|title = Dropmore Park Estate official website includes drawings and pictures|url = http://www.dropmorepark.com/home.asp|accessdate = 2009-02-06|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081119231747/http://www.dropmorepark.com/home.asp|archivedate = 2008-11-19|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; around 2006-2008. The restoration included the house, Edwardian stables and a number of garden buildings including a Chinese tea house and aviary. Further plans over a 15-year period include restoration of the formal flower beds, Italian garden, woodlands, lawns, vistas, roads, bridges and gates.&lt;ref name = "BBC"/&gt;The developer has since gone into liquidation before the redvelopment was completed. Dropmore was then purchased in 2012 by Richard and Ian Livingstone. The historic research and masterplans were produced by a team headed by Papa Architects and the Terra Firma Consultancy, [http://www.terrafirmaconsultancy.com/projects-heritage-parks-dropmore.php Landscape Architects].

The exterior of the house and the grounds were used extensively for the location filming of the [[Doctor Who]] serial [[Day of the Daleks]].

'''Feminist epistemology''' is an examination of the subject matter of [[epistemology]] from a [[feminist]] standpoint. [[Elizabeth S. Anderson|Elizabeth Anderson]] describes feminist epistemology as being concerned with the way in which [[gender]] influences our concept of knowledge and "practices of inquiry and justification".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Anderson | first = Elizabeth S. | author-link = Elizabeth S. Anderson | contribution = Feminist epistemology and philosophy of science | editor-last = Zalta | editor-first = Edward N. | editor-link = Edward N. Zalta |title = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2004 Edition) | year = 2004 | url = http://stanford.library.usyd.edu.au/archives/sum2004/entries/feminism-epistemology/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally regarded as falling under the umbrella of [[social epistemology]].

==Overview==
Feminist epistemology emphasizes how important ethical and political values are in shaping epistemic practices, and interpretations of evidence. Feminist epistemology studies how gender influences our understanding of knowledge, justification and theory of knowledge; it describes how knowledge and justification disadvantage women. Scientists of feminist epistemology claim that knowledge discriminate women by: preventing them from inquiry and presenting women as an inferior, because these theories of knowledge satisfy only male interests, which strengthen gender hierarchies.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"&gt;{{Citation | last = Young | first = I. M. | contribution = Throwing like a girl and other essays in feminist political theory. |title = Bloomington: Indiana University Press  | year = 1990 | url = https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central idea of feminist epistemology is that knowledge reflects the particular perspectives of the theory. The main interest of feminist philosophers is how gender stereotypes situate knowing subjects. They approach this interest from three different perspectives: feminist standpoint theory, feminist postmodernism, and feminist empiricism. Standpoint theory defines a specific social perspective as epistemically privileged. Feminist postmodernism emphasizes the instability of the social identity explorers and therefore their representations. Empiricism focuses on combining the main ideas of feminism and their observations to prove feministic theories through evidence.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

Elizabeth Anderson argues that the concept of [[situated knowledge]] is central to feminist epistemology. [[Donna Haraway]] asserts that most knowledge (in particular academic knowledge) is always situated and "produced by positioned actors working in/between all kinds of locations, working up/on/through all kinds of research relation(ships)" (Cook, ''et al.''),&lt;ref&gt;Ian Cook, 'Positionality/Situated Knowledge'  for David Sibley ''et al.'' (eds)''Critical Concepts in Cultural Geography''. London, IB: Taurus http://www.gees.bham.ac.uk/downloads/gesdraftpapers/iancook-situatedknowledge.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925160741/http://www.gees.bham.ac.uk/downloads/gesdraftpapers/iancook-situatedknowledge.pdf |date=September 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus what is known and the ways in which this knowledge can be known is subject to the position—the situation and perspective—of the knower.

The English feminist philosopher [[Miranda Fricker]] has argued that in addition to social or political injustices, there can be [[epistemic injustice|''epistemic'' injustices]] in two forms: testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice. ''Testimonial injustice'' consists in prejudices that cause one to "give a deflated level of credibility to a speaker's word":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda Fricker|title=Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gztTPgAACAAJ|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=August 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957052-2|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fricker gives the example of a woman who due to her gender is not believed in a business meeting. She may make a good case, but prejudice causes the listeners to believe her arguments to be less competent or sincere and thus less believable. In this kind of case, Fricker argues that as well as there being an injustice caused by possible outcomes (such as the speaker missing a promotion at work), there is a testimonial injustice: "a kind of injustice in which someone is ''wronged specifically in her capacity as a knower''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda Fricker|title=Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gztTPgAACAAJ|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=August 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957052-2|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ''hermeneutical injustice'', "speakers' knowledge claims fall into lacunae in the available conceptual resources, thus blocking their capacity to interpret, and thence to understand or claim a hearing for their experiences."&lt;ref&gt;Lorraine Code, 2008.

The philosopher [[Susan Haack]] is a notable critic of feminist epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Susan |last=Haack|authorlink=Susan Haack|title=Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate: Unfashionable Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ezeTXOlQngC |year=2000 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-31137-1 |origyear=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lynn Hankinson Nelson|title=The Very Idea of Feminist Epistemology|jstor=3810236|journal=Hypatia|volume=10|number=3|pages=31–49|year=1995|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1995.tb00736.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Harding]] organized feminist epistemology into three categories: feminist empiricism, standpoint epistemology, and post-modern epistemology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Doucet, A., &amp; Mauthner, N. (2006). Feminist methodologies and epistemology. ''Handbook of 21st Century Sociology. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage'', 36-45.
&lt;/ref&gt; While potentially a limited set of categories, post-modern feminism was a transitional ideology that denounced absolute objectivity and asserted the death of the meta-narrative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While these three categories of feminist epistemology have their place in history (see [[feminist empiricism]], [[standpoint feminism]], [[postmodern feminism]]), as ideological frameworks they hold epistemic insights in contemporary feminist method. Feminist theorist [[Nina Lykke]], has expanded upon these three categories to include "''postmodern feminist (anti-)epistemology''...[and]...''postconstructionist feminist epistemology''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j7THBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=nina+lykke+feminist+epistemology&amp;lr=|title=Feminist Studies: A Guide to Intersectional Theory, Methodology and Writing|last=Lykke|first=Nina|date=2010-04-05|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781136978982|location=|pages=126|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist empiricism ==
Feminist empiricism emerged from a feminist critique that gave attention to male bias in positivistic practices of science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 2nd Wave feminist researchers identified how quantification and objectivity, as facets of positivism, have been held as the “gold standard” for social and political science research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = C. | last2 = Cohen | first2 = R. L. | year = 2010 | title = Feminists really do count: The complexity of feminist methodologies | url = | journal = International Journal of Social Research Methodology | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 189–196 | doi = 10.1080/13645579.2010.482249 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantification, and its political relationships to notions of objectivity, maintains methodological dominance and preference primarily in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is perpetuated by how funding authorities tend to prioritize quantitative research with positivist frameworks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Feminist empiricists believe in the concept of positivism; that all knowledge can be understood objectively and can be accessed through empirical research.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hesse-Biber, S. N. &amp; Leavy, P. L. (2007). Feminist empiricism: challenging gender bias and “setting the record straight”. In Hesse-Biber, S. N. &amp; Leavy, P. L. ''Feminist research practice'' (pp. 26-52). : SAGE Publications Ltd doi: 10.4135/9781412984270.n2
&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that pre-feminist positivism was actually not objective at all, since traditional positivism’s ‘androcentric bias’ led to only partial or ‘subjective’ knowledge of the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In essence, all empirical inquiry is inherently skewed by value judgments and biased interpretation of evidence by male-biased authorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, it was not until retrieving statistical data on the prevalence of women in the workplace experiencing (what is now known to be) ‘sexual harassment’ through surveys in the 1970s that sexual harassment became identified by political authorities as a commonality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Without this intervention of feminists in an empirical field, this commonality would never have been identified as an issue, since males had no reason to pursue this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Londa Schiebinger further asserts that empirical research “embodies many core feminist values”, in that feminist empiricists are actively seeking out and eliminating exploitative research whilst resisting strategic, oppressive explanations of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schiebinger | first1 = L | year = 2003 | title = Introduction: Feminism inside the sciences | url = | journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 859–886 | doi=10.1086/345319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist empiricism is critiqued for its belief that “objectivity” is best achieved through quantification, whether or not viewed through a feminist lens or utilized for feminist ideals.  The division between quantitative and qualitative data has historically reinforced gendered dichotomies of “hard/soft, emotional/rational, worthy/worthless”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many assert that ‘objective truth’ is a false concept, and thus feminist empiricists may overestimate the extent to which they can increase objectivity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bart, J. (1998, January 19). Feminist Theories of Knowledge: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Retrieved October, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.dean.sbc.edu/bart.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, positivism and quantitative research has been critiqued as a “detached” philosophical framework that inherently objectifies its research subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Feminist empiricists respond to the problem of value-neutrality by lengthening Quine's argument: theory is not determined by evidence. Any observation counts as proof for
particular thesis only if connected with certain background presumptions, because similar observation might support different hypotheses. In daily life, scientists face some restrictions in selecting the background assumptions, that are based on cognitive values like simplicity and conservatism, which a political and social philosophy that is based on retaining traditional social establishments. Feminist empiricists state that no logical or methodological principle categorically prohibits scientists from choosing their background assumptions as their political and social values or other interests. Therefore, feminist scientists may select their background presumptions on account of their opinions on some feminist values.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

=== Two paradoxes ===
There are two central paradoxes with feminist empiricism

'''The paradoxes of bias''' 
The first paradox is that many feminist empiricists advocate for exposing the androcentric and sexist biases in scientific research, namely that people have a bias towards gender difference and sexuality.  However, while feminist empiricists would claim that the feminist inquiry helps the development of science, their own perspective adopts certain bias about gender and science.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

'''The paradox of social construction'''
The second paradox is about many science criticisms expose that the scientific inquiry is influenced by both social and political factors.The theories of androcentric and sexist are influenced by the most society are what they advocate, which can be understood as in order to eliminate the bias, the term like “ individualist epistemology” would be used.  However, they want scientific to be open to different social influences, which the bias of female is also a part of social influence.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

'''Criticism of empiricism theory:''' It is the most criticized theory by others, for its assumptions that transhistorical subject of knowledge exists outside of social determination ([[Sandra Harding|Harding]] 1990). Also feminist empiricism theory states that science will correct all the biases and errors in theories about women and other groups by itself.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

== Standpoint epistemology ==
At a basic level, standpoint epistemology asserts that marginalized groups such as women are bestowed with an “epistemic privilege”, where there exists the potential for less distorted understandings of the world than dominant groups, such as men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This methodology presents many new ideas to the Feminist Empiricist notion that androcentric dominance and bias presents an incomplete understanding of the world.  A “standpoint” is not so much about a subject’s biased perspective, but instead the ‘realities’ that structure social relationships of power.

Standpoint theories portray the universe from a concrete situated perspective. Every standpoint theory must specify: the  social location from the  feminist perspective, the  scope of its privileges, the social role and the identity that generates knowledge and the justification of these privileges. Feminist standpoint theory states a privilege in gender relations, various feminist standpoint theories are based on the statement about the epistemic privilege in different feministic situations. Feminist standpoint theory is one of the types of critical theory, their main intention is to improve their situation. In order to achieve this critical aim, social theories must represent the understanding of feministic problems and try to improve their condition. Critical theory is theory of, by, and for the subjects of study. Feminism and feminist epistemology is all about inquiry, assumptions, and theories. Through these methods feminist epistemology overcomes the tension between bias on which feminist empiricism is based on.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Harding, S. (1996). Borderlands Epistemologies. In A. Ross (ed.), ''Science wars''. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press 331-340.  &lt;nowiki&gt;https://femmethodsuwyo.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/hardingborderlandsepist.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; It presents an elaborate map or method for maximizing “strong objectivity” in natural and social science,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; yet does not necessarily focus on encouraging positivistic scientific practices, like is central to Feminist Empiricism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although standpoint epistemology has been critiqued for focusing too closely on a distinctive women’s perspective which may render invisible concepts of historically and sociologically variable knowledge,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Harding strongly asserts that standpoint epistemology does not essentialize any particular marginalized identity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Harding further argues that the methodology does not subscribe to notions of “maximizing neutrality” between groups in an effort to maximize objectivity, but instead recognizes that the power relations between groups are what complicate these relationships.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is in some ways contrary to Doucet’s assertion&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that the controversy of ''how'' power influenced knowledge production is a post-standpoint, more contemporary debate. Standpoint epistemology also poses a necessity to ask critical questions about the lives and social institutions created by dominant groups; where the field becomes a sociology ''for'' women and not solely ''about'' women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In practicality, standpoint theory has widespread use as "a philosophy of knowledge, a philosophy of science, a sociology of knowledge, a moral/political advocacy of the expansion of democratic rights".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Although it has been asserted that “epistemic privilege” is inherent to marginalized groups,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Harding poses standpoint theory as an explanatory means for both marginalized and dominant group individuals to be able to achieve liberatory perspectives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In building her standpoint epistemology, Sandra Harding used and built on the work of philosophers of science [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Willard Quine]]. Harding's standpoint theory is also grounded in Marxism, although she largely rejected Marxism for it's portrayal of women in merely class terms.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinnick|first=Cassandra L.|date=1994|title=Feminist Epistemology: Implications for Philosophy of Science|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/188340|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=61|issue=4|pages=646–657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', Kuhn argued that scientific progress does not occur through gradual accumulation of correct ideas. Rather, he believed that there were occasionally large revolutions that completely overturned the previous scientific theories. When a crisis occurs within the prevailing theory of a time, revolutionary scientists will challenge them and build new scientific theories. For example, in his view, the transition from the geocentrism of Ptolemy to the heliocentric theory of Copernicus did not occur through a gradual series of challenges and improvements to the previous model. Rather, it was a sudden and complete revolution because it is impossible to conceptualize the theory of heliocentrism within the dominant geocentric theory. Kuhn argued that together, the ideas of Newton, Galileo, and Kepler completed the revolution that Copernicus started. However, most students of science do not learn of the many failed and alternative scientific paradigms. They are taught a version of the history of science where progress is guaranteed and linear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 4th Edition|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2012|isbn=9780226458120|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Harding’s view, Kuhn’s theories showed that all science was situated within its historical context, and that any theory could remain accepted if its believers held power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HARDING|first=SANDRA|date=1992|title=After the Neutrality Ideal: Science, Politics, and "Strong Objectivity"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40970706|journal=Social Research|volume=59|issue=3|pages=567–587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism of standpoint theory:''' Philosopher [[Helen Longino]] is against standpoint theory, because she claims that standpoint theory can not provide the knowledge of which standpoints have the most privilege. Bar On (1993) said that if feminine ethics of care provides privileged perspective on morality, then our moral knowledge is convinced only by existence of gender relations. Bar On also claims that theory which explains structural relationship between advanced and less developed, which dictates epistemic privilege can not be applied to women. [[Marx]] claimed that class conflict derives other conflicts such as racism, sexism, national and religious conflicts.

Feminist epistemology is criticized by different philosophers. Feminist postmodernists blame feminist empiricists for assuming the existence of an individual and for admitting an uncritical concept of experience. Naturalized Quine epistemology of some feminist empiricists perceives knowers as socially situated; Hundleby, a standpoint theorist, criticizes feminist empiricism for disregarding the key role of women in political activities.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

Standpoint theory is often criticized for the lack of evidence available to support it and the ideas underlying it, such as the lack of justification for the [[underdetermination]] theory Harding uses. Pinnick, to illustrate her point about Harding's poor evidence, points to standpoint theory’s claim that science is more objective if it is politically motivated, which Pinnick claims runs contrary to what has happened in the past when scientists deliberately injected politics into their theories (she cites eugenics and intelligence test designs as examples of politicized science). She also criticizes Harding for claiming that marginalized groups produce better, less biased scientific results because, according to Pinnick, Harding fails to provide any empirical evidence for this idea.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Post-modernism ==
Post-modern thought marks a feminist group shift away from dominant, positivistic ideals of objectivity and universal understanding.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Instead, it acknowledges a diversity of unique human perspectives, none of which can claim absolute knowledge authority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Post-Modern feminism has thus been critiqued for having a relativist-stance, where ongoing power relations between key identities have been often neglected attention.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is possible to see this political stance in direct opposition to the “emancipatory aspirations” of women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, [[Saba Mahmood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahmood | first1 = S | year = 2001 | title = Feminist Theory, Embodiment, and the Docile Agent: Some Reflections on the Egyptian Islamic Revival | url = | journal = Cultural Anthropology | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 202–236 | doi = 10.1525/can.2001.16.2.202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; would argue this critique is in some ways oppositional to global understandings of female desire, where the idea of ‘freedom’ is an essential, conditionally oppressive component to western feminism which may wrongly assume that women of eastern countries dominated by male power are victims needing to be liberated.

[[Donna Haraway]], a post-modern feminist, shows how post-modern feminism recognizes positivism as an inherently oppressive ideology, where science’s rhetoric of truth was used to undermine marginalized people’s agency and delegitimize ‘embodied’ accounts of truth.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haraway | first1 = D | year = September–October 1988 | title = Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective | url = https://philpapers.org/rec/HARSKT| journal = Feminist Studies | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 575–599 | doi = 10.2307/3178066 | jstor = 3178066 | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, they argue that ‘objectivity’ is an external, disembodied point of view left only to privileged (unmarked bodies), because marginalized (marked bodies) cannot have perspectives dissociated from ‘who they are’.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Despite post-modern relativist criticism,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; this theory resists relativism in firmly recognizing power relations in that objectivity is a privilege of unmarked bodies. Haraway’s theory of “situated knowledges” holds true to post-modern ideology, where knowledge should be placed in context; this creates a more limited range of knowledge than theoretical “objectivity”, but is richer in allowing for exchange of understanding between individual experiences.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Positivism inherently gives way to authoritarian positions of knowledge which hinder discussion and render limited understanding of the world.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Both positivist science and relativism have been recognized as contrary to post-modern feminist thought, since both minimize the significance of context (geographic, demographic, power) on knowledge claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collins | first1 = P. H. | year = 1990 | title = Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment | url = | journal = Contemporary Sociology | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 221–238 | doi = 10.2307/2074808 | jstor = 2074808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism of postmodernism:''' Key features of postmodernism: “Women” not the category of analysis and contains of perspectives which are controversial with feminist theory. The fact that women are in different social position can experience sexism differently, does not mean that they do not suffer from it ([[MacKinnon]] 2000). The postmodernism theory dissolves all groups, and supports the ideas that knowledge from any source is  better than no knowledge at all ([[Susan Bordo|Bordo]] 1990).&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

=== Theory in the flesh ===
Post-modern feminism’s assertion of “situated knowledges”,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; plays well into [[Cherríe Moraga|Cherrie Moraga]]’s piece “Theory in the Flesh”, where the ‘physical realities’ of indigenous peoples’ lives are said to be the means of creating a decolonial politic against oppressive, inaccessible, Eurowestern academic methods of knowledge production.&lt;ref&gt;Moraga, C., &amp; Anzaldúa, G. (1983). Theory in the Flesh. In ''This bridge called my back: Writings by radical women of color''. New York: Kitchen Table, Women of Color Press. 23.
&lt;/ref&gt; This epistemological framework has been utilized by feminists like [[bell hooks]], who claims that theorizing is often tied to a process of self-recovery and collective liberation; it is not thus limited to those in the western academic realm, nor does it require ‘scientific’ research.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Hooks, B. (1994). Theory as a Liberatory Practice. In ''Teaching to transgress: Education as the practice of freedom''. New York: Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks asserts that theory and practical application of emancipatory politics can, and often do, exist simultaneously and reciprocally.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Post-Modern feminism has given way to the question of whether or not there should be any particular feminist ways of knowing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 'theory in the flesh' seems to suggest that prioritizing or normalizing any specific feminist epistemology would in itself be, and has been, oppressive.

=== Feminist epistemic virtue theory ===
This theory focuses on how power and gender relations behave in terms of value theory and epistemology. [[Susan Bordo|Bordo]]’s (1990) and [[Genevieve Lloyd|Lloyd]]’s (1984) examined how “maleness” and “femaleness” are used in philosophical theories and discussions about relationship such as, reason/unreason, reason/emotion and objectivity/subjectivity. [[Lorraine Code]]’s (1987, 1991, 1995, 1996) with other feminist co-workers determined in which ways political and social routine shapes our identities and perspectives of our world and especially gender, how it leads to understanding of epistemic responsibility. Code’s works also have been influential in epistemological fields, which can be described as version of naturalism takes and reinvents simple and uncontroversial empirical beliefs, for example the belief like “I know that I am seeing a bird”, deforms the epistemic animal nature. Feminist epistemic virtue theorists rejects almost all the assumptions. Skeptical problems can not get any connections with it, so it is ignored and considered as a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref&gt;Feminist Epistemology. (n.d.). Retrieved February 9, 2017 from Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: http://www.iep.utm.edu/fem-epis/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist science criticism and feminist science==

=== Feminist science criticism: bias as error ===
Feminist science criticism mainly has five different kinds of research about gender and science to address five identified biases.  These are studies of how:
* Exclusion or marginalization of women scientists impair scientific progress.
* Applications of science and technology disadvantage women and other vulnerable groups and treat their interests as less important.
* Science has ignored women and gender, and how turning attention to these issues may require revisions of accepted theories.
* Biases toward working with “masculine” cognitive styles (and in some cases even the words related to them) that may — through limiting, partial, or incomplete perspective — lead to errors of omission or unjustified conclusions.
* Research into sex differences that reinforces sex stereotypes and sexist practices fail to live up to standards of good science.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

=== Feminist science: bias as resource ===

Feminist science argues that the inquiry of science which informed by feminist epistemology is based on legalizing and produce the limiting partial bias.
Pluralist feminist scientists and philosophers of science define feminist science as preferred content and “feminine” method.&lt;ref name="Young 1990"/&gt;

The '''genealogical certificate''' (''Abstammungsurkunde'') was a civil status certificate under German law to prove the birth of a child and it differs slightly from a [[birth certificate]].

The main purpose of the genealogical certificate was to determine marriage bans with adopted children. Since this had little practical significance, the genealogical certificate was abolished on January 1, 2009, by the Civil Status Law Reform Act.

Genealogical certificates were issued until December 31, 2008, by the civil registry office that had certified the birth. It contained, among other things, the child's name, sex, date of birth, place of birth, and parents' names. There are also any changes listed in a genealogical certificate that have occurred since the birth of the child, such as adoption or name changes.

Genealogical certificates were documents that reflected the actual descent of a person. For marriages a genealogical certificate was required since only it showed who the biological parents were. Since 2009, a "certified register printout of birth registration" is required upon marriage instead, which also contains information about the birth parents. This differs from the birth certificate, since the birth certificate only includes the legal parents, namely the adoptive parents.

The biological fatherhood of the alleged biological father is not assured when printed in the aforementioned genealogical certificate or "certified register of birth."

[[File:George MacKenzie.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sir George Mackenzie.]]
'''Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh''' (1636/1638–1691) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] lawyer, [[Lord Advocate]], [[essayist]] and legal writer.&lt;ref&gt;The exact year of his birth is uncertain: his biography in the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] identifies the year as 1636, as does the biography published in the folio edition of his works (1716-1722), but he himself in his own work, ''The Religious Stoic'', declared in 1663 that he was not yet 25 {{harv|Lang|1909|p=22}}. "[He was born] either in 1636, as most sources assert, or in 1638, as his own works suggest" {{harv|Jackson|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mackenzie, who was born in [[Dundee]], was the son of Sir Simon Mackenzie of [[Lochslin]] (died c. 1666) and Elizabeth Bruce, daughter of the Reverend Peter Bruce, minister of St Leonard's, and Principal of St Leonard's Hall in the University of St Andrews.  He was a grandson of [[Kenneth Mackenzie, 1st Lord Mackenzie of Kintail|Kenneth, Lord Mackenzie of Kintail]] and a nephew of [[George Mackenzie, 2nd Earl of Seaforth]].{{sfn|Lang|1909|p=21}}

He was educated at the [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], [[University of Aberdeen]] (which he entered in 1650), the [[University of St Andrews]], and the [[University of Bourges]] in France.{{sfn|Lang|1909|p=25}}

==Career==
[[File:George Mackenzie after Kneller.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Sir George Mackenzie, by [[Godfrey Kneller|Sir Godfrey Kneller]]]]
Mackenzie was elected to the [[Faculty of Advocates]] in 1659, and spoke in defence at the trial of [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll|Archibald Campbell, Marquis of Argyll]] in 1661.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{harv|Jackson|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acted as [[justice-depute]] from 1661 to 1663, a post that involved him in extensive [[witch trial]]s.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;

Mackenzie was knighted, and was a member of the Scottish Parliament for the County of Ross from 1669.{{sfn|Lee|1903|p=817}} In 1677 he became [[Lord Advocate]],{{sfn|Cousin|1910}} and a member of the [[Privy Council of Scotland]].{{sfn|Lee|1903|p=817}}

As Lord Advocate he was the [[minister (government)|minister]] responsible for the persecuting policy of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in Scotland against the Presbyterian [[Covenanter]]s. After the [[Battle of Bothwell Bridge]] in 1679 Mackenzie imprisoned 1,200 Covenanters in a field next to [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]].&lt;ref&gt;The field was later incorporated into Greyfriars Kirkyard and that section is known as the "Covenanters' Prison" {{harv|Scottish Covenanter Memorials Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some were executed, and hundreds died of maltreatment. His treatment of Covenanters gained him the nickname "Bluidy Mackenzie".{{sfn|Cousin|1910}} It has been argued that both he and [[John Graham of Claverhouse|Claverhouse]] kept to the letter of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruce Lenman|author2=J Mackie|title=A History of Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cvp_njNb2sC&amp;pg=PT315|accessdate=26 February 2013|date=28 February 1991|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-192756-5|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether or not the epithet "Bluidy" is contemporary; it appears in ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'' (1818), given to Davie Deans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Lang|title=Sir George MacKenzie: King's Advocate, of Rosehaugh, His Life and Times 1636(?)-1691|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HojdEeuOZo0C&amp;pg=PA2|accessdate=26 February 2013|date=1 November 2005|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-58477-616-1|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of blood prevails in the published testimony of Marion Harvey, hanged in 1681, who calls her blood onto Mackenzie: ""that excommunicate tyrant, George Mackenzie, the advocate", among others.&lt;ref name="Christ1794"&gt;{{cite book|title=A cloud of witnesses, for the royal prerogatives of Jesus Christ: or, The last speeches and testimonies of those who have suffered for the truth in Scotland, since 1680|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MKAHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA99|accessdate=26 February 2013|year=1794|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mackenzie mausoleum, Greyfriars.JPG|thumb|180px|Mackenzie mausoleum in Greyfriars, Edinburgh]]
Mackenzie resigned for a short time in 1686, taking up office again in 1688.{{sfn|Lee|1903|p=817}} He opposed the dethronement of [[James II of England|James II]], and to escape the consequences he retired from public life.{{sfn|Lee|1903|p=817}}

==Last years==
Mackenzie retired at the [[Glorious Revolution]] to [[Oxford]]. In London on 9 March 1690 he dined with [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]] and [[John Evelyn]], two literary opponents from the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Evelyn|title=Diary and correspondence of John Evelyn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1U7AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA317|accessdate=26 February 2013|year=1870|publisher=Bell and Daldy|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at [[Westminster]] on 8 May 1691 and is buried in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] in [[Edinburgh]], his mausoleum being designed by [[James Smith (architect)|James Smith]].{{sfn|Cousin|1910}}

==Works==
In private life Mackenzie was a cultivated and learned gentleman with literary tendencies. He published in 1660 ''Aretina'', which has been called the first [[Novel in Scotland|Scottish novel]].&lt;ref name="Mackenzie2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Mackenzie|title=The Laws And Customes Of Scotland, In Matters Criminal: Wherein To Be Seen How The Civil Law, And The Laws And Customs Of Other Nations Do Agree With, And Supply Ours|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kjp58dFZEuMC&amp;pg=PR3|accessdate=26 February 2013|date=1 October 2005|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-58477-605-5|pages=iii note 4.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is remembered as the author of various graceful [[essay]]s.

==Legacy==
Mackenzie was the founder of the [[Advocates Library]] in [[Edinburgh]]. His inaugural oration there is dated 15 March 1689, so just before his departure south; but the evidence is that the oration was written some years before, and the library itself was operational from the early 1680s.&lt;ref&gt;Cadell and Matheson, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative followed Mackenzie's appointment as [[Dean of the Faculty of Advocates]], in 1682.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clare Jackson|title=Restoration Scotland, 1660-1690: Royalist Politics, Religion and Ideas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUcT221m02sC&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=26 February 2013|year=2003|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=978-0-85115-930-0|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

'''Hester Dowden''' (1868–1949), or '''Hester Travers Smith''', was an Irish spiritualist [[Mediumship|medium]] who is most notable for having claimed to contact the spirits of [[Oscar Wilde]], [[William Shakespeare]] and other writers. Dowden's spirit-communications were published by various authors. She wrote ''Voices from the Void'' (1919), an account of her life as a medium, and ''Psychic Messages from Oscar Wilde'' (1923).

Dowden was the daughter of the Irish literary scholar [[Edward Dowden]]. She used both her maiden name and her married name Hester Travers Smith.&lt;ref name = "ghost"&gt;Helen Sword, ''Ghostwriting Modernism'', Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY., 2002, pp. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband was a prominent Dublin physician. Dowden was closely linked to the Irish literary world through her father, knowing, among others [[W.B. Yeats]] and [[Bram Stoker]]. She was probably the model for the medium in Yeats's play, ''The Words upon the Window Pane''. Her daughter, the [[Abbey Theatre|AbbeyTheatre]] stage designer [[Dorothy Travers Smith|Dorothy Travers-Smith]], married the playwright [[Lennox Robinson]].&lt;ref name = "ghost"/&gt; Though she wrote only two books under her own name, her spirit-communications provided the basis for approximately twelve books published by other authors.&lt;ref&gt;Her first book was published as "Hester Travers Smith", but she was generally later known as Dowden. See Hester Dowden,''Gale Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Dowden had intended to become a musician. In 1891 she moved to London to study music, but was forced to travel back to Dublin to look after her father when her mother died. When her father remarried in 1895, Dowden clashed with his new wife. Within a few months she had moved out of the house to marry Dr. Travers Smith. The marriage was not a success. The couple eventually separated and were divorced in 1916. They had one daughter, [[Dorothy Travers Smith]]. Dowden moved back to London, becoming a professional medium in 1921.&lt;ref&gt; Murphy, Andrew, "Amateurs and Professionals: Regendering Bacon" in Edmondson, P. &amp; Wells, S. ''Shakespeare Beyond Doubt'', Cambridge University Press, 2013, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mediumship==
Dowden claimed to communicate via various spirit guides, "Peter" (an Irish-American rogue), "Eyen" (an ancient Egyptian priest), "Astor" (also another medium's guide),  "Shamar" (a Hindu),  and finally "Johannes." The last was an ancient Jewish neo-Platonist who lived 200 years before Jesus. 

She was closely associated with [[William Fletcher Barrett]], the psychical researcher. She was also responsible for introducing [[Geraldine Cummins]] to mediumship.

Dowden set up as a professional medium after she became convinced of her powers. In ''Voices from the Void'' she claimed that the spirit of [[Hugh Lane]], who had drowned in the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'' spoke to her before she knew of his death in the disaster. Her son-in-law Lennox Robinson and a vicar were present when the communication came through. However, Lane's death had been reported in the papers that very day. Dowden claimed not to have read them.&lt;ref name = "bent"/&gt;

==Conversations with Oscar Wilde==
Dowden published her conversations with Oscar Wilde in 1923. Wilde revealed that he was unable to read in the spirit world and had to see through the eyes of living people, "Over the whole world have I wandered, looking for eyes by which I might see. . . . Through the eyes out of the dusky face of a Tamal girl I have looked on the tea fields of Ceylon, and through the eyes of a wandering Kurd I have seen Ararat and the Yezedes. . . . It may surprise you to learn that in this way I have dipped into the works of some of your modern novelists."&lt;ref name = "ghost"/&gt; He also gave his views on the work of these recent writers, including [[George Bernard Shaw]], of whom Wilde said "I have a very great respect for his work. After all, he is my fellow-countryman. We share the same misfortune in that matter. I think Shaw may be called the true type of pleb. He is so anxious to prove himself honest and outspoken that he utters a great deal more than he is able to think. He is ever ready to call upon his audience to admire his work, and his audience admires it from sheer sympathy with his delight." He opined that [[John Galsworthy]] was the best modern dramatist. He dismissed [[Thomas Hardy]] as a "harmless rustic" but admired [[George Meredith]] for his appreciation of beauty. He loathed [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''Ulysses'', which was a "great bulk of filth" and "heated vomit".&lt;ref name = "bent"/&gt;

Wilde also demonstrated that he had no homosexual inclinations, but instead revealed his utter adoration of womankind, "My sensations were so varied with regard to your sex, dear lady, that you would find painted on my heart – that internal organ so often quoted by the vulgar – you would find every shade of desire there, and even more... Women were ever to me a cluster of stars. They contained for me all, and more than all, that God has created." Dowden also received a new play, entitled ''Is it a Forgery?'', from Wilde, which was written in the spirit world.&lt;ref&gt;Travers Smith, Hester, "How I Received Oscar Wilde's Spirit Play", ''The Graphic'', 10 March 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Joyce read the book and parodied the conversations with Wilde in ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', in which Wilde spouts gibberish to a medium, "Tell the woyld I have lived true thousand hells. Pity, please, lady, for poor O.W. in this profundust snobbing I have caught. Nine dirty years mine age, hairs hoar, mummeries failend, snowdrift to my elpow, deff as Adder. I askt you, dear lady, to judge on my tree by our fruits. I gave you of the tree."&lt;ref name = "hel"/&gt;

==Shakespeare conversations==
Dowden was consulted by Alfred Dodd, a writer who wanted to prove that [[Francis Bacon]] was the true author of the works attributed to [[William Shakespeare]]. Dowden communicated with Bacon via her spirit-guide "Johannes". The spirits confirmed Dodd's theory, which he published in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Dodd, ''The Immortal Master'', London, Rider &amp; Co., 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowden was later contacted by [[Percy_Allen (writer)|Percy Allen]] who wanted to prove that Shakespeare's works were written by [[Edward de Vere]], Earl of Oxford, not Bacon. On this occasion the spirits confirmed Allen's views. It was revealed that Oxford was the leader of a collaborative effort among poets and scholars to create the works. It was also revealed that [[Oberon]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' was a portrait of [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton]], who was in fact the illegitimate son of Oxford and [[Queen Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref name = "hel"&gt;Helen Sword, "Modernist Hauntology: James Joyce, Hester Dowden, and Shakespeare's Ghost", ''Texas Studies in Literature and Language'', vol 41. Issue: 2., 1999, pp.-192-196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "shap"&gt;Shapiro, James (2010), ''Contested Will: Who Wrote Shakespeare?'', UK edition: Faber and Faber (US edition: Simon &amp; Schuster), pp.196–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spirit of Bacon told Allen that he had been misquoted when Dowden had received the messages she passed on to Dodd, but that Dowden was not to blame because another spirit had garbled the message on that occasion.&lt;ref name = "shap"/&gt; Dowden's biographer Edmund Bentley later confirmed that Allen's was the final and true revelation, that from his teenage years Allen had been destined to be the bearer of the ultimate truth: "a plan had been worked out by spirit people interested in his earthly life that he should be the means of finally unravelling the great mystery of Shakespeare's origin and work."&lt;ref name = "bent"&gt;Edmund Bentley, ''Far Horizon: A Biography of Hester Dowden: Medium and Psychic Investigator'', London: Rider Company, 1951. For a more recent discussion of Dowden see Helen Sword, ''Ghostwriting Modernism'', Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY.,  2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These events forced Allen to stand down as president of the Oxfordian organisation the ''[[Shakespeare Fellowship]]''.&lt;ref name = "shap"/&gt;

==World War II leaders==
In 1941 Dowden, who was living in [[Chelsea, London]] at the time, received messages from "Johannes" commenting on the personalities of the principal national leaders during [[World War II]]. These were conveyed to the writer Peter Fripp as analyses of the motives and actions of Hitler and Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt. Seen from the spirit-world, Hitler was not evil but rather "a man whose stars threw him into the world with vast disadvantages, with overwhelming ambition sweltering in his soul, and with an infinite capacity for receiving influences and suggestions from our side." Open to spirit-influence Hitler was a passive recipient of dangerous spirits working on his "colossal egotism" so that he became a conduit for evil. Stalin, in contrast, is "crafty and careful" rather than egotistic. Churchill "can be hot-headed, full of zeal and enthusiasm, and, at the same time, never lose his balance in the least." Roosevelt is an "intricate personality" who is "affectionate, and has a genuine love for the human race. He is not fond of adventure, as Churchill is, but he would not shirk risks if he felt they might set things in the right direction."&lt;ref name = "bent"/&gt;

{{History of Uganda}}
The '''history of Uganda from 1962 through 1971''' comprises the [[history of Uganda]] from [[Uganda]]n independence from the [[United Kingdom]] to the rise of the dictator [[Idi Amin]].

Early independent Uganda during this period was dominated by the regime of [[Milton Obote]], Uganda's first [[Prime Minister of Uganda|Prime Minister]] and subsequently [[President of Uganda|President]], who after being deposed by Amin returned to power in the 1980s.

==Move to independence==
Uganda's approach to independence was unlike that of most other [[colonialism|colonial territories]] where [[political parties]] had been organized to force self-rule or independence from a reluctant colonial government. In Uganda there had been some demands for greater autonomy, but these were mostly expressed by local nationalisms surrounding the five constituent kingdoms of the colony. One exception was the long-lived [[Uganda National Congress]], based on the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] of India.

Uganda was greatly divided along national, religious, and ethnic lines. The national divisions were the most apparent. The country was dominated by [[Buganda]], much to the annoyance of the other four kingdoms. The kingdom of [[Bunyoro]] felt especially aggrieved having been deprived of its "lost counties" when Uganda became a British [[protectorate]].

Deep religious divisions had developed. The British-linked and British-supported elite had largely converted to [[Protestantism]]. The majority of the population, were [[Catholic]] and they were excluded from power by the Protestants. Ethnic divisions were just as important. Under the British, Uganda's economic activity was mostly undertaken by a large group of Indian immigrants who operated many of the businesses and constituted the majority of the colony's merchants. Moreover, there was a long-standing divide between the [[Nilotic]]s of the north and the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] of the south of the country.

Upon independence three parties developed. The [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]] (DP), modelled on Germany's [[Christian Democrats]], represented the Catholic population. The [[Uganda People's Congress]] (UPC) was supported mainly by groups from the north and western parts. The [[Kabaka Yekka]] (KY) (meaning "king only") was a Bugandan nationalist party. In the pre-independence period the Democratic Party, surprisingly, won the most seats, but not a majority. The Uganda People's Congress and Kabaka Yekka united to form the government, excluding the DP. Upon independence [[Milton Obote]], the leader of the Uganda People's Congress, became the nation's first [[Prime Minister of Uganda|Prime Minister]].

==UPC-KY coalition rule (1962–64)==
The Uganda People's Congress had several obstacles to forming a government. The party leadership was fragmented. Each party functionary represented a local constituency, and most of the constituencies were ethnically distinct. For example, [[Milton Obote]]'s strength lay among his [[Langi people|Langi]] kin in northern Uganda; [[George Magezi]] represented the local interests of his Bunyoro compatriots; [[Grace S.K. Ibingira]]'s strength was in the [[Ankole]]; and [[Felix Onama]] was the northern leader of the largely neglected [[West Nile District]] in the north-west corner of Uganda. Each of these regional political bosses and those from the other Uganda regions expected to receive a ministerial post in the new Uganda government, to exercise [[patronage]], and to bring the material fruits of independence to local supporters. Failing these objectives, each was likely either to withdraw from the UPC coalition or realign within it.

The UPC had had no effective urban organization before independence, although it was able to mobilize the trade unions, most of which were led by non-Ugandan immigrant workers from [[Kenya]] (a situation which contributed to the independent Uganda government's almost immediate hostility toward the trade unions). No common ideology united the UPC, the composition of which ranged from the near reactionary [[Onama]] to the radical [[John Kakonge]], leader of the [[UPC Youth League]]. As prime minister, Obote was responsible for keeping this loose coalition of divergent interest groups intact.

Obote also faced the task of maintaining the UPC's external alliances, primarily the coalition between the UPC and the [[Kabaka of Buganda|kabaka]], who led [[Buganda]]'s KY. Obote proved adept at meeting the diverse demands of his many partners in government. He even temporarily acceded to some demands which he found repugnant, such as Buganda's claim for special treatment. This accession led to demands by other kingdoms for similar recognition. The [[Busoga]] chiefdoms banded together to claim that they, too, deserved recognition under the rule of their newly defined monarch, the ''kyabasinga''. Not to be outdone, the [[Iteso]] people, who had never recognized a precolonial king, claimed the title ''kingoo'' for [[Teso District, Uganda|Teso District]]'s political boss, [[Cuthbert Obwangor]]. Despite these separatist pressures, Obote's long-term goal was to build a strong central government at the expense of entrenched local interests, especially those of Buganda.

The first major challenge to the Obote government came not from the kingdoms, nor the regional interests, but from the military. In January 1964, units of the [[Ugandan Army]] mutinied, demanding higher pay and more rapid promotions. Minister of Defense Onama, who courageously went to speak to the mutineers, was seized and held [[hostage]]. Obote was forced to call in British troops to restore order, a humiliating blow to the new [[regime]]. In the aftermath, Obote's government acceded to all the mutineers' demands, unlike the governments of Kenya and [[Tanganyika]], which responded to similar demands with increased discipline and tighter control over their small military forces.

The military then began to assume a more prominent role in Ugandan life. Obote selected a popular junior officer with minimal education, [[Idi Amin Dada]], and promoted him rapidly through the ranks as a personal protégé. As the army expanded, it became a source of political patronage and of potential political power.

== Breakup of the coalition (1964) ==
Later in 1964, Obote felt strong enough to address the critical issue of the "lost counties" which the British had postponed until after independence. The combination of patronage offers and the promise of future rewards within the ruling coalition gradually thinned opposition party ranks, as members of parliament [[crossed the floor]] to join the government benches. After two years of independence, Obote finally acquired enough votes to give the UPC a majority and free himself of the KY coalition. The turning point came when several DP members of parliament from [[Bunyoro]] agreed to join the government side if Obote would undertake a popular [[referendum]] to restore the "lost counties" to Bunyoro. The kabaka, naturally, opposed the [[plebiscite]]. Unable to prevent it, he sent 300 armed Baganda veterans to the area to intimidate Banyoro voters. In turn, 2,000 veterans from Bunyoro massed on the frontier. [[Civil war]] was averted, and the referendum was held. The vote demonstrated an overwhelming desire by residents in the counties annexed to Buganda in 1900 to be restored to their historic Bunyoro allegiance, which was duly enacted by the new UPC majority despite KY opposition.

This triumph for Obote and the UPC strengthened the central government and threw Buganda into disarray. KY unity was weakened by internal recriminations, after which some KY stalwarts, too, began to "cross the floor" to join Obote's victorious government. By early 1966, the result was a parliament composed of seventy-four UPC, nine DP, eight KY, and one independent MP.&lt;!-- Ref: US Gov.--&gt; The Obote regime was to become associated with food shortage, corruption, and the terrorizing, harassing, and torturing of Ugandans, particularly [[Indians in Uganda|Indian traders]].&lt;ref name="mutibwa"&gt;Mukasa Mutibwa, ''Uganda Since Independence: a story of unfulfilled hopes'', pp. 65–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

== UPC multi-party rule (1964–66)==
As the perceived threat from Buganda diminished, many non-Baganda alliances weakened. And as the possibility of an opposition DP victory faded, the UPC coalition itself began to come apart. The one-party state did not signal the end of political conflict; it merely relocated and intensified that conflict within the party. The issue that brought the UPC disharmony to a crisis involved Obote's military protégé, Idi Amin.

In 1966 Amin caused a commotion when he walked into a [[Kampala]] bank with a gold bar (bearing the stamp of the government of the [[Belgian Congo]]) and asked the bank manager to exchange it for cash. Amin's account was ultimately credited with a deposit of £17,000. Obote rivals questioned the incident, and it emerged that the prime minister and a handful of close associates had used Colonel Amin and units of the Uganda Army to intervene in the neighbouring [[Congo Crisis]]. Former supporters of [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] leader [[Patrice Lumumba]], led by a "General Olenga," opposed the American-backed government and were attempting to lead the Eastern Province into secession. These troops were reported to be trading looted ivory and gold for arms supplies secretly smuggled to them by Amin. The arrangement became public when Olenga later claimed that he failed to receive the promised munitions. This claim appeared to be supported by the fact that in mid-1965, a seventy-five-ton shipment of [[China|Chinese]] weapons was intercepted by the Kenyan government as it was being moved from [[Tanzania]] to Uganda.

Obote's rivals for leadership within the UPC, supported by some Baganda politicians and others who were hostile to Obote, used the evidence revealed by Amin's casual bank deposit to claim that the prime minister and his closest associates were corrupt and had conducted secret foreign policy for personal gain, in the amount of £25,000 each. Obote denied the charge and said the money had been spent to buy the munitions for Olenga's Congolese troops. On 4 February 1966, while Obote was away on a trip to the north of the country, an effective "no confidence" vote against Obote was passed by the UPC Mps. This attempt to remove Obote appeared to be organized by UPC Secretary General Grace S.K. Ibingira, closely supported by the UPC leader from Bunyoro, George Magezi, and a number of other southern UPC notables. Only the radical UPC member, John Kakonge, voted against the motion.

Because he was faced with a nearly unanimous disavowal by his governing party and national parliament, many people expected Obote to resign. Instead, Obote turned to Idi Amin and the army, and, in effect, carried out a [[coup d'état]] against his own government in order to stay in power. Obote suspended the [[constitution]], arrested the offending UPC ministers, and assumed control of the state. He forced a new constitution through parliament without a reading and without the necessary quorum. That constitution abolished the federal powers of the kingdoms, most notably the internal autonomy enjoyed by Buganda, and concentrated presidential powers in the prime minister's office. The kabaka objected, and Buganda prepared to wage a legal battle. Baganda leaders rhetorically demanded that Obote's "illegal" government remove itself from Buganda soil.

Buganda, however, once again miscalculated, for Obote was not interested in negotiating. Instead, he sent Idi Amin and loyal troops to attack the kabaka's palace on nearby [[Mengo Hill]]. The palace was defended by a small group of bodyguards armed with [[rifle]]s and [[shotgun]]s. Amin's troops had heavy weapons but were reluctant to press the attack until Obote became impatient and demanded results. By the time the [[Battle of Mengo Hill]] resulted in the palace being overrun, the kabaka had taken advantage of a [[cloudburst]] to exit over the rear wall. He hailed a passing [[taxicab|taxi]] and was driven off to exile. After the assault, Obote was reasonably secure from open opposition. The new republican 1967 constitution abolished the kingdoms altogether. Buganda was divided into four districts and ruled through martial law, a forerunner of the military domination over the civilian population that all of Uganda would experience after 1971.

== UPC one-party rule (1966–71) ==
Obote's success in the face of adversity reclaimed for him the support of most members of the UPC, which then became the only legal political party. The original independence election of 1962, therefore, was the last one held in Uganda until December 1980. On the home front, Obote issued the "[[Common Man's Charter]]," echoed the call for [[African socialism]] by Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]], and proclaimed a "[[move to the left]]" to signal new efforts to consolidate power. His critics noted that he placed most control over economic nationalization in the hands of an [[Asian people|Asian]] millionaire who was also a financial backer of the UPC. Obote created a system of secret police, the [[General Service Unit]] (GSU). Headed by a relative, [[Akena Adoko]], the GSU reported on suspected subversives. The Special Force Units of paramilitary police, heavily recruited from Obote's own region and ethnic group, supplemented the security forces within the army and police.

Although Buganda had been defeated and occupied by the military, Obote was still concerned about security there. His concerns were well founded; in December 1969 he was wounded in an [[assassination]] attempt and narrowly escaped more serious injury when a [[grenade]] thrown near him failed to explode. He had retained power by relying on Idi Amin and the army, but it was not clear that he could continue to count on their loyalty.

==Rivalry with Idi Amin==
Obote appeared particularly uncertain of the army after Amin's sole rival among senior army officers, Brigadier [[Acap Okoya]], was murdered early in 1970. (Amin later promoted the man rumored to have recruited Okoya's killers.) A second attempt was made on Obote's life when his motorcade was ambushed later that year, but the vice-president's [[automobile|car]] was mistakenly riddled with bullets. Obote began to recruit more [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and Langi troops, and he accelerated their promotions to counter the large numbers of soldiers from Amin's home, which was then known as West Nile District. Obote also enlarged the paramilitary Special Force as a counterweight to the army.

Amin, who at times inspected his troops wearing an outsized sport shirt with Obote's face across the front and back, protested his loyalty. But in October 1970, Amin was placed under temporary house arrest while investigators looked into his army expenditures, reportedly several million dollars over budget. Another charge against Amin was that he had continued to aid southern [[Sudan]]'s [[Anyanya]] rebels in opposing the regime of [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] even after Obote had shifted his support away from the Anyanya to Nimeiry. This foreign policy shift provoked an outcry from Israel, which had been supplying the Anyanya rebels. Amin was close friends with several [[Israel]]i military advisers who were in Uganda to help train the Ugandan Army, and their eventual role in Amin's efforts to oust Obote remained the subject of continuing controversy.

The '''history of [[poison]]'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Poison]] is defined as a "substance that causes death or injury when swallowed or absorbed." {{cite book|title=Collins English Dictionary|author=Colins Dictionaries, from the Bank of English|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|page=594|year=2001|isbn=0-00-766691-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; stretches from before 4500 BC to the [[present day]]. Poisons have been used for many purposes across the span of human existence, most commonly as [[weapon]]s, [[anti-venom]]s, and medicines. Poison has allowed much progress in branches, [[toxicology]], and technology, among other sciences.

Poison was discovered in [[ancient times]], and was used by ancient tribes and civilizations as a hunting tool to quicken and ensure the death of their prey or enemies. This use of poison grew more advanced, and many of these ancient peoples began forging weapons designed specifically for poison enhancement. Later in history, particularly at the time of the [[Roman Empire]], one of the more prevalent uses was assassination. As early as 331 BC, poisonings executed at the dinner table or in drinks were reported, and the practice became a common occurrence. The use of fatal substances was seen among every social class; even the [[nobility]] would often use it to dispose of unwanted political or economic opponents.

In [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] Europe, poison became a more popular form of killing, though cures surfaced for many of the more widely known poisons. This was stimulated by the increased availability of poisons; shops known as [[apothecaries]], selling various medicinal wares, were open to the public, and from there, substances that were traditionally used for curative purposes were employed for more sinister ends. At approximately the same time, in the Middle East, Arabs developed a form of arsenic that is odorless and transparent, making the poison difficult to detect. This "poison epidemic" was also prevalent in parts of Asia at this time, as well.

Over the centuries, the variety of harmful uses of poisons continued to increase. The means for curing these poisons also advanced in parallel. In the modern world, intentional poisoning is less common than the Middle Ages. Rather, the more common concern is the risk of accidental poisoning from everyday substances and products.

Constructive uses for poisons have increased considerably in the modern world. Poisons are now used as  [[pesticide]]s, [[disinfectant]]s, cleaning solutions, and [[preservative]]s. Nonetheless, poison continues to be used as a hunting tool in remote parts of developing countries, including Africa, South America, and Asia.

==Origins of poison==

[[Image:Strychnos toxifera - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-267.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Strychnos toxifera'', a plant used for the making of dart and arrow poisons]]
[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] findings prove that while [[human evolution|ancient mankind]] used conventional weapons such as axes and clubs, and later swords, they sought more subtle, destructive means of causing death—something that could be achieved through poison.&lt;ref name="ancient"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portfolio.mvm.ed.ac.uk/studentwebs/session2/group12/ancient.htm|title=Ancient poisons|accessdate=1 April 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321025053/http://www.portfolio.mvm.ed.ac.uk/studentwebs/session2/group12/ancient.htm|archivedate=21 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Grooves for storing or holding poisons such as [[tubocurarine]] have been plainly found in their hunting weapons and tools, showing that early humans had discovered poisons of varying potency and applied them to their weapons.&lt;ref name="ancient" /&gt; Some&lt;!-- who? --&gt; speculate that this use and existence of these strange and noxious substances was kept secret within the more important and higher-ranked members of a [[tribe]] or [[clan]], and were seen as emblems of a greater power. This may have also given birth to the concept of the stereotypical "[[medicine man]]" or "[[witch doctor]]".&lt;ref name="ancient" /&gt;

Once the use and danger of poison was realized, it became apparent that something had to be done. [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates VI]], King of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] (an ancient [[Hellenistic]] state of northern [[Anatolia]]), from around 114–63 BC, lived in constant fear of being assassinated through poison. He became a hard-working pioneer in the search for a cure for poisons.&lt;ref name="ancient" /&gt; In his position of power, he was able to test poisons on criminals facing execution, and then if there was a possible antidote. He was paranoid to the point that he administered daily amounts of poisons in an attempt to make himself immune to as many poisons as he could.&lt;ref name="ancient" /&gt; Eventually, he discovered a formula that combined small portions of dozens of the best-known herbal remedies of the time, which he named [[Mithridatium]].&lt;ref name="ancient" /&gt; This was kept secret until his kingdom was invaded by [[Pompey|Pompey the Great]], who took it back to Rome.  After being defeated by [[Pompey]], Mithridates' antidote prescriptions and notes of medicinal plants were taken by the Romans and translated into Latin.&lt;ref name="mithridatum"&gt;Grout, James. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/aconite/mithridatum.html Mithridatum] (June 2008). Retrieved on 29 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] describes over 7000 different poisons. One he describes as "The blood of a duck found in a certain district of Pontus, which was supposed to live on poisonous food, and the blood of this duck was afterwards used in the preparation of the Mithridatum, because it fed on poisonous plants and suffered no harm."&lt;ref name="ancient" /&gt;

===India===

Indian surgeon [[Sushruta]] defined the stages of slow poisoning and the remedies of slow poisoning. He also mentions antidotes and the use of traditional substances to counter the effects of poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;Wujastyk, D. et al. ''The Roots of Ayurveda: Selections from Sanskrit Medical Writings''. {{ISBN|0-14-044824-1}}. p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
Unlike many civilizations, records of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] knowledge and use of poisons can only be dated back to approximately 300 BC. However, it is believed that the earliest known Egyptian [[pharaoh]], [[Menes]], studied the properties of poisonous plants and venoms, according to early records.&lt;ref name="ancient" /&gt;

The Egyptians are also thought to have come into knowledge about elements such as [[antimony]], copper, [[arsenic|crude arsenic]], lead, [[opium]], and [[Mandragora officinarum|mandrake]] (among others) which are mentioned in [[papyrus|papyri]]. Egyptians are now thought to be the first to master [[distillation]], and to manipulate the poison that can be retrieved from apricot kernels&lt;!-- Is this cyanide? --&gt;.&lt;ref name="ancient" /&gt;

[[Cleopatra]] is said to have poisoned herself with an asp after hearing of [[Marc Antony]]'s demise. Prior to her death, she was said to have sent many of her maidservants to act as guinea pigs to test different poisons, including [[belladonna (plant)|belladonna]], [[henbane]], and the [[strychnine]] tree's seed.&lt;ref name="RD"&gt;{{cite book |author= Readers Digest.|title=Magic and Medicine of Plants |publisher=Reader's Digest Association |location=Pleasantville, N.Y |year=1986 |page=389 |isbn=0-89577-221-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, the alchemist [[Agathodaemon (alchemist)|Agathodaemon]] (around {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;300) spoke of a mineral that when mixed with [[natron]] produced a 'fiery poison'. He described this poison as 'disappearing in water', giving a clear solution.&lt;ref name="emsley2-3"/&gt; Emsley speculates that the 'fiery poison' was arsenic trioxide, the unidentified mineral having to have been either [[realgar]] or [[orpiment]], due to the relation between the unidentified mineral and his other writings.&lt;ref name="emsley2-3"&gt;Emsley, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome===
[[Image:Nero Palatino Inv618.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A bust of the Roman Emperor Nero, who used cyanide to dispose of unwanted family members]]

In Roman times, poisoning carried out at the dinner table or common eating or drinking area was not unheard of, or even uncommon, and was happening as early as 331 BC.&lt;ref name="ancient" /&gt; These poisonings would have been used for self-advantageous reasons in every class of the social order. The writer [[Livy]] describes the poisoning of members of the upper class and nobles of Rome, and Roman emperor [[Nero]] is known to have favored the use of poisons on his relatives, even hiring a personal poisoner. His preferred  [[enema]] poison was said to be [[cyanide]].&lt;ref name="ancient" /&gt;

Nero's predecessor, [[Claudius]], was allegedly poisoned with mushrooms or alternatively poison herbs.&lt;ref name=Suet44&gt;Suetonius, ''Claudius''&lt;/ref&gt; However, accounts of the way Claudius died vary greatly. [[Halotus]], his taster, [[Gaius Stertinius Xenophon]], his doctor, and the infamous poisoner [[Locusta]] have all been accused of possibly being the administrator of the fatal substance, but [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], his final wife, is considered to be the most likely to have arranged his murder and may have even administered the poison herself. Some report that he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at his evening meal, while some say that he recovered somewhat, only to be poisoned once more by a feather dipped in poison which was pushed down his throat under the pretense of helping him to vomit,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]]; ''Annals'' XII p. 64, pp. 66–67;&lt;/ref&gt; or by poisoned gruel or an enema.&lt;ref name=Suet44/&gt; Agrippina is considered to be the murderer, because she was ambitious for her son, [[Nero]], and Claudius had become suspicious of her intrigues.&lt;ref&gt;Accounts of his death: [[Suetonius]] ''Claudius'' p. 43–44; [[Tacitus]]; ''Annals'' XII 64, pp. 66–67; [[Pliny the Elder]] ''Natural History'' II p. 92, XI p. 189, XXII p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later imperial Asia==

Despite the negative effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example can be found in the works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar [[Rhazes]], writer of ''Secret of Secrets'', which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to distil alcohol and use it as an anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a [[laxative]]. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the [[itch]]', which is now referred to as [[scabies]]. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch.&lt;ref name="emsley3-4"&gt;Emsley, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi suicides by poison===

Nazi war leader [[Hermann Göring]] used cyanide to kill himself the night before he was supposed to be hanged during the [[Nuremberg Trials]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/nurembergcont.htm The Sentencing and Execution of Nazi War Criminals, 1946]. Retrieved on 3 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] had also taken a pill of [[cyanide]] but he bit down on the capsule and shot himself in the right temple shortly before the fall of Berlin along with his wife, [[Eva Braun]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902253,00.html TIME magazine – How Hitler Died].

In the late 20th century, an increasing number of products used for everyday life proved to be poisonous. The risk of being poisoned nowadays lies more in the accidental factor, where poison be induced or taken by accident. Poisoning is the 4th most common cause of death within young people. Accidental ingestions are most common in children less than 5 years old.

However, hospital and emergency facilities are much enhanced compared to the first half of the 20th century and before,
and antidotes are more available.
Antidotes have been found for many poisons, and the antidotes for some of the most commonly known poisons are shown in the table above:

However, poison still exists as a murderous entity today, but it is not as popular form of conducting murder as it used to be in past times, probably because of the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors that must be taken into consideration. One of the more recent deaths by poisoning was that of Russian dissident [[Alexander Litvinenko]] in 2006 from lethal [[Polonium|polonium-210]] [[radiation poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/news/articles/press_releases/2006/241106_litvinenko.htm |title=HPA Press Release |first=Alexander |last=Litvinenko |work=Health Protection Agency |accessdate=2008-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126112245/http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/news/articles/press_releases/2006/241106_litvinenko.htm |archivedate=26 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cropduster spraying pesticides.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A [[cropduster]] spreading pesticide.]]

===Other uses===

Today, poison is used for a wider variety of purposes than it used to be. For example, poison can be used to rid an unwanted infestation by pests or to kill weeds. Such chemicals, known as [[pesticide]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/index.htm What is a Pesticide?] (US EPA definitions) retrieved 24 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; have been known to be used in some form since about 2500 BC. However, the use of pesticides has increased staggeringly from 1950, and presently approximately 2.5 [[million]] tons of industrial pesticides are used each year.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. Tyler Jr. (2002). Living in the Environment (12th Ed.). Belmont: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Other poisons can also be used to [[Food preservation|preserve foods]] and building material.

===In culture===

Today, in many developing peoples of countries such as certain parts of Africa, South America and Asia, the use of poison as an actual weapon of hunting and attack still endures.

In Africa, certain arrow poisons are made using floral ingredients, such as of that taken from the plant ''Acokanthera''. This plant contains [[ouabain]], which is a cardiac glycoside, [[oleander]], and [[milkweed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/curare.htm|title=African arrow poison ingredients|accessdate=28 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Poisoned arrows are also still used in the jungle areas of [[Assam]], Burma and [[Malaysia]]. The ingredients for the creation of these poisons are mainly extracted from plants of the ''[[Antiaris]]'', ''[[Strychnos]]'' and ''Strophanthus'' genera, and ''[[Antiaris toxicaria]]'' (a tree of the [[mulberry]] and [[breadfruit]] family), for example, is used in the Java island of Indonesia, as well as several of its surrounding islands.
The juice or liquid extracts are smeared on the head of the arrow, and inflicts the target [[paralysis]], [[convulsions]] and/or cardiac arrest, virtually on strike due to the speed in which the extracts can affect a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/object_stories/arrows/index.html|title=Poisoned Arrows|accessdate=30 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as plant based poisons, there are others that are made that are based on animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a [[beetle]] genus of the Northern [[Kalahari Desert]] is used to create a slow-acting poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an [[adhesive]]. However, instead of the plant sap, a [[powder (substance)|powder]] made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museums.org.za/bio/insects/beetles/chrysomelidae/arrows.htm|title=Animal Based Poisons Today – Kalahari Beetle|accessdate=30 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070426015844/http://www.museums.org.za/bio/insects/beetles/chrysomelidae/arrows.htm |archivedate = 26 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galerie Colbert.jpg|thumb|The INHA is located in the Colbert Gallery]]
The '''Institut national d'histoire de l'art''' (INHA; National Institute for Art History) is a French research institute, created and governed by Decree No. 2001-621 (July 12, 2001) and situated in [[Paris]].

The Institute develops scientific activity and contributes to international cooperation in most fields of [[art history]] and heritage by exercising research, training and knowledge-diffusion. It is located in the Galerie Colbert in Paris, which houses the Department of Education and Research and the Richelieu Quadrilateral Area. The latter's Labrouste Room houses the Department of Documentation, which holds collections from the Art and Archeology Library founded by [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]] in 1897 and donated in 1917 to the [[University of Paris]].

The INHA's mission is to promote international art historical research in all fields of the history of art. It pilots a large number of programs by gathering together university researchers and curators. It organises study days, symposiums, conferences and meeting-debates and develops different resources, documentary bases and research programs in art history. Each year, the INHA invites about sixty art historians, among them experienced researchers, academics, curators, art critics and doctoral students. Twice a year, the INHA publishes a scientific review on art history entitled ''Perspective''. Many documentary bases are to be found on the INHA's website.

The institute is located in Paris at 2, Rue Vivienne, in a former 17th century town house converted into a gallery in the 19th century. Its art history library, one of the largest in the world with more than {{formatnum:1700000}} documents, is located in the Labrouste room of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] at 58 rue de Richelieu.

The INHA provides access to external and internal online databases like [https://www.inha.fr/fr/ressources/outils-documentaires/acces-global-et-organise-aux-ressources-en-histoire-de-l-art-agorha.html AGORHA (''Accès global et organisé aux ressources en histoire de l’art'')] which allows several search modes in the different research fields of the INHA: [https://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/jsp/portal/index.jsp general search] (or use « ''Rechercher'' » in the bar), [https://www.inha.fr/_contents/ametys-internal%253Asites/inha/ametys-internal%253Acontents/montee-de-version-d-agorha-apercu-des-nouveautes-article/_metadata/content/_data/rBtOsQxW1GywhbJvoKIEvJX4xm3Abz_aOUdCDp3zTWGgSS41vm-XB6J2M1rCTzU33ZVZFIuNerUFNetDEetmaftLiJg7ZKS1Zb0ec2bdC99b9g3gFWlorw-em_EHOCzivIj3CF97 simple search], expert search and search by links, in particular in the RETIF ([https://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/ark:/54721/0014 ''répertoire des tableaux italiens dans les collections publiques françaises (XIIIe-XIXe siècles))''] which gives the {{formatnum:13761}} italian paintings held in French public collections.

{{Distinguish|text = [[FIAT-IFTA]]: Fédération Internationale des Associations de Thanatologues – International Federation of Thanatologists Associations also known as World Wide Federation of Funeral Services}}

The '''Fédération Internationale des Archives de Télévision - International Federation of Television Archives''' (FIAT/IFTA) is a worldwide [[Trade association|association]] of institutions, commercial companies and individuals managing or with a special interest in [[audiovisual]] [[archiving]] in general and [[television]] archives in particular. Many members are commercial and [[public broadcaster]]s, but also national (audiovisual) archives are involved ever more. In general terms the association wants to connect the members, to spread knowledge in the field of television archiving and to defend their interests on an international level.

== Organisation ==

The goal of the federation is to create cooperation among television archives, multimedia and audiovisual archives and libraries. To meet these goals,  FIAT/IFTA  provides  forums to share knowledge and experience. Some of FIAT/IFTA’s main objectives are to provide a forum for exchange of knowledge and experience between its members, to promote the study of any topic relevant to the development and use of audiovisual archives and to establish international standards on key issues regarding all aspects of audiovisual media archive management. FIAT/IFTA has over 250 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fiatifta.org/fiatifta-organisation/ International Federation of Television Archives web site]&lt;/ref&gt; The office is currently situated at the [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]].

FIAT/IFTA has working relations with other organisations in the field, amongst others as a member of the [[Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Associations]].

=== Executive Council ===

FIAT/IFTA is chaired by a president (elected every 2 years with one possible re-election) and a general-secretary.
The President, the General-Secretary, the Treasurer and the Commission Chairs are ex-officio members of the Executive Council.
Next to these, the other Executive Council members, accumulating to a maximum of 12, are elected every 4 years, by groups of 6 alternating every 2 years.

=== Commissions ===

Next to the Executive Council, FIAT/IFTA has got 4 commissions, each with 6 à 12 members and a chair:

*'''Media Management Commission''': the only commission existing since the founding of the organisation. It started off in 1977 as the 'Commission Systèmes Documentaires'. In 1981 the name was changed to 'Documentation Commission' and in 2001 to 'Media Management Commission'.
*'''Preservation &amp; Migration Commission''': called into existence in 1982 as the 'Technical Commission' it existed up until 2000. In 2007 it was restarted as the Preservation &amp; Migration Commission.
*'''Program &amp; Production Commission''': initiated in 1993 as the 'Programming and Production Commission' it has since the beginning mainly focused on the organisation of the FIAT/IFTA Awards.
*'''Media Studies Commission''': started off in 1998 as a bridge towards the academic research world in the field of [[television studies]]. It was called the 'Academic Research Work Group' and in 2000 renamed as the 'Television Studies Working Group'. From 2003 it grew to a true commission calling itself the 'Television Studies Commission'. In 2016 the current name 'Media Studies Commission' was adopted.

== Initiatives ==

=== Conferences and seminars ===

==== FIAT/IFTA World Conference ====

The FIAT/IFTA World Conference is held each year, usually in October. The evening programme includes an opening cocktail, a gala dinner and the annual FIAT/IFTA Archive Achievement Awards gala. The 2016 FIAT/IFTA World Conference was held in [[Warsaw]], the 2017 edition in [[Mexico City]], the 2018 edition will take place in [[Venice]], hosted by [[RAI]]. In the even years the World Conference also holds a General Assembly, during which the new president and a part of the Executive Council is elected. The Conference features keynotes speakers, panels discussions, workshops, masterclasses, case study presentations, social events, and networking opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fiatifta.org/world-conference-2014-amsterdam/speakers-world-conference-2014/ fiatifta.org, World Conference 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Regional Seminars ====

Next to this, FIAT/IFTA organises regional seminars around the globe, in order to focus on regional television archiving challenges. Recent editions were held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] (Regional Media Management Seminar, 2016), [[Bucharest]] (Regional Television Studies Seminar, 2015) and [[Dubai]] (Regional Preservation &amp; Migration Seminar, 2008).

==== Media Management Seminars ==== 

The Media Management Commission also organises a biannual seminar called 'Media Management Seminar' since 1998. The proceedings of these seminars are published and printed and freely available online via the FIAT/IFTA website. Recent editions where held in [[Lugano]] (2017), [[Glasgow]] (2015), [[Hilversum]] (2013), [[Toronto]] (2011) and [[Stockholm]] (2009).  

=== FIAT/IFTA Archive Achievement Awards ===

FIAT/IFTA Archive Achievement Awards is a series of three annual awards given for the best use of archival material, the best archive preservation project and the most innovative use of archival material. Several other categories have come up and disappeared over the course of the nineties and 2000s. Occasionally also a Lifetime Achievement Award is attributed to a person with exceptional and enduring merits in the field of audiovisual archiving.

=== FIAT/IFTA Save Your Archive ===

Save Your Archive is a program designed to help saving endangered audiovisual collections. The ambition is to save the world audiovisual heritage, starting with a few collections. The Program does so by various means, including by providing financial support, training and/or technical assistance. The program speaks to FIAT/IFTA’s core mission – designing useful policies and tools to serve the archival community and developing cooperation among its members. The program works under the umbrella of the [[Archives at Risk]] campaign by the [[Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Associations]] (CCAAA). In the past projects in [[East-Timor]], [[Madagascar]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Romania]], [[Colombia]], ... have received help from the programme.

== History ==

FIAT/IFTA was founded as an association under [[French Law]] on 5 October 1977, when archives directors of mainly broadcasters but also national audiovisual archives felt the need to establish a separate organisation dedicated to television archives, as they weren't accepted as members of the [[International Federation of Film Archives]]. Most members knew each other via the [[European Broadcasting Union]]. After preparative meetings in the course of 1976-1977 in Paris, London and Rome, the first conference of FIAT/IFTA was held in October 1977 in Paris.

After Paris 1977, annual World Conferences took place all over the world:

'''José Santos Arraño Acevedo''' (14 October 1921 – 23 November 2009) was a [[Chile]]an journalist and historian, who worked in several regional newspapers, including ''[[El Rancagüino]]'' from [[Rancagua]], ''La Discusión'' from [[Chillán]], amid others. He also wrote two books on the [[history of Pichilemu]]:  ''Pichilemu y Sus Alrededores Turísticos'' ("Pichilemu and its tourist surroundings") and ''Hombres y Cosas de Pichilemu'' ("People and stuff from Pichilemu").

== Biography ==

=== Life ===
[[File:House of José Arraño.jpg|thumb|right|José Arraño Acevedo's house in [[Pichilemu]].]]
Arraño Acevedo was born on 14 October 1921 in [[Quebrada del Nuevo Reino]], near [[Pichilemu]], then part of [[Colchagua Province]], Chile. He was one of twelve sons of José Luis Arraño Ortiz and María Soledad Acevedo Caro.&lt;ref name="Homenaje"&gt;[http://www.pichilemu.cl/noticias/sep2009/2511/index.htm Homenaje a la partida de Don José Santos Arraño Lizana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128085753/http://www.pichilemu.cl/noticias/sep2009/2511/index.htm |date=28 November 2009 }}, ''[[Pichilemu]]'s official website'' {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his childhood he lived in Pichilemu. Arraño studied at the Escuela de los Hermanos Maristas, now [[Instituto San Fernando]], in [[San Fernando, Chile|San Fernando]], and at the Pontifical Seminary of [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]].

He worked as a journalist in newspapers such as ''[[Las Últimas Noticias]]'' in [[Santiago]], ''[[El Rancagüino]]'' from [[Rancagua]], ''El Sur'' from [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]], ''La Prensa'' from [[Curicó]], ''La Discusión'' from [[Chillán]], ''La Región'' from [[San Fernando, Chile|San Fernando]], amid others. He became a member of the Sociedad de Escritores de Rancagua (Writers' Society of Rancagua) in its foundation year, 1979.&lt;ref name="rancaguino"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bncatalogo.cl/htdocs/RC0063625.pdf|title=José Arraño Acevedo y su próximo primer libro|date=15 June 1988|work=[[El Rancagüino]]|publisher=Sociedad Informativa Regional|language=Spanish|accessdate=7 August 2012|location=Rancagua, Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bncatalogo.cl/htdocs/RC0034919.pdf |title=Acanthus |author=José Arraño Acevedo |date=6 December 1998 |accessdate=2009-12-12 |language=Spanish |publisher=La Prensa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of his articles were gathered in two books: ''Pichilemu y sus alrededores turísticos'' and ''Hombres y Cosas de Pichilemu''. ''Pichilemu y sus alrededores turísticos'' was first published by Editora e Imprenta El Promaucae from Pichilemu in 1999. Although ''Hombres y Cosas de Pichilemu'' was first announced in 1988 in ''[[El Rancagüino]]'',&lt;ref name="rancaguino"/&gt; it was first published in September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pichilemunews.cl/cartasdetalle.php?id=9|title=Pichilemu alrededor de José Arraño Acevedo|last=Aravena Llanca|first=Jorge|date=25 November 2009|work=[[Pichilemu News]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=7 August 2012|location=Pichilemu, Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his last years, he hosted a radio programme called ''La Hora de José Arraño Acevedo'', which was broadcast for almost a decade. His phrase "¡Qué lindo es Pichilemu!" ("How beautiful Pichilemu is!") became famous during his time as a radio host.&lt;ref name="PichilemuChile"&gt;[http://www.pichilemuchile.com/?p=562 Pichilemu lamenta la muerte de José Arraño Acevedo]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Pichilemu Chile'' {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
On 22 November 2009 he was admitted to the Pichilemu Hospital, and died on 23 November at 14:00 local time, of pneumonia at the age of 88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elcachapoal.cl/content/view/667999/Jose-Arrano-el-prolifico-escritor-dos-libros-y-centenares-de-articulos-en-diarios-murio-ayer.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707010327/http://www.elcachapoal.cl/content/view/667999/Jose-Arrano-el-prolifico-escritor-dos-libros-y-centenares-de-articulos-en-diarios-murio-ayer.html |archivedate= 7 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His funeral was held in the Inmaculada Concepción Church of [[Pichilemu]], and was later buried on 24 November 2009 in the Cemetery of [[Pichilemu]].&lt;ref name="Homenaje"/&gt;

==Change of era==

==Events of the ''Kanna'' era==

* '''August 23, 986''' (''Kanna 2, 16th day of the 7th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 寛和二年七月十六日  --&gt;: Iyasada-''shinnō'' was appointed as [[heir]] and [[crown prince]] at age 11.&lt;ref name="b302" /&gt; This followed the convention that two imperial lineages took the throne in turn, although Emperor Ichijō was in fact Iyasada's junior. He thus gained the [[nickname]] ''Sakasa-no moke-no kimi'' (the imperial heir in reverse). When Emperor Kanzan abandoned the world for holy orders, this grandson of Kaneie ascended to the throne as [[Emperor Ichijō]].&lt;ref&gt;Varley, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3752">'''Lucas de Tui''' (or '''O Tudense''') (died 1249) was a [[Kingdom of León|Leonese]] cleric and intellectual, remembered best as a [[historian]]. He was Bishop of [[Tui, Galicia|Tuy]] from 1239 until his death.

Born in [[León, León|León]], Lucas was a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of San Isidoro there between 1221 and 1239. While a canon he wrote ''De Miraculis Sancti Isidori'' in defence of [[Isidore of Seville]]. He also travelled extensively: to [[Rome]], [[Constantinople]], [[Cyprus]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Armenia]], and [[France]]. He visited all four of the [[Holy Nails]]: in France, Constantinople, [[Nazareth]], and [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]]. In 1233 or 1234 he passed [[Easter]] in Rome and completed his tract ''De altera vita fideique controversiis adverus Albigensium errores'' against the [[Cathars]], taking inspiration mainly from Isidore and [[Jerome]].

In 1236, upon a request from [[Berenguela of Castile|Queen Berenguela]], he composed the '''''Chronicon mundi''''', a four-part chronicle of world history and his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. Beginning with [[Creation according to Genesis|Creation]] and ending in 1236, the ''Chronicon'' aspired to give comprehensive coverage to two topics: the world and the Spains. Lucas' principal sources are Isidore, [[John of Biclar]], [[Hydatius]], [[Orosius]], the ''[[Chronicle of Alfonso III]]'', the ''[[Crónica Silense]]'', and [[Sampiro]]. Lucas does contain a few historical titbits which are found nowhere else, but he is not generally regarded as reliable in this regard.

In 1239 he was made bishop of Tuy, and there he died ten years thence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1902">'''Mathieu d'Escouchy''' ([[Le Quesnoy]], [[Nord (French department)|Nord]], 1420 – 1482) was a [[Picardy|Picard]] chronicler during the last stages of the [[Hundred Years War]].

His ''Chronique'' was a continuation of the chronicle of [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]], with manuscripts of which it occurs as a third volume; it was edited by G. du Fresne de Beaucourt, (3 vols., Paris, Societé de l'Histoire de France, 1863–64). Matthieu covers the years 1444-67, from a point of view favourable to [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], but with an attempt at impartiality, though he was in the service of  [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], with whom he fought at the [[Battle of Montlhéry]] (16 July  1465), after which he was ennobled. Like most literate men of his time, he was fascinated by feats of arms, brave tourneys and the social stature of the men (and a few women) who figure in his chronicle. His account of the [[Feast of the Pheasant|Banquet du Voeu du Faisan]], describes the ceremonious feast held at [[Lille]] in 1454 by [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy|Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy]], whose court set the standards for elegant extravagance in the fifteenth century.
 
He was appointed Echevin and Prévôt of [[Péronne, Somme|Péronne]]. He fell afoul of justice, was even arrested and tortured but set free at last.

In ''Escouchy'' some editors read a variant of the familiar seigneurial name ''[[Lord of Coucy|Coucy]]''.

'''Morgan W. Phillips''' (1943–1996) was an American founder of the field of [[architectural conservation]]. He is credited with coining the term "architectural conservation" in the early 1970s and was among the first to call himself an ''architectural conservator''.&lt;ref&gt;"AIC News: the newsletter of the American Institute for the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works", Vol. 21-22 (1996), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Phillips worked for most of his career at the [[Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities]] (SPNEA) in Boston, now [[Historic New England]], and the organization's Conservation Center was largely built around his research and that of his apprentices.

Phillips pioneered a number of techniques that would subsequently become standard in the field, including the microscopic examination of historic paint layers, the use of epoxies for wood repairs, and the acrylic consolidation of fragile historic material. He and Andy Ladygo perfected an acrylic injection technique for re-attaching historic plaster walls and ceilings to wooden laths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Leeke |first=John |title=Saving Irreplaceable Plaster |journal=Old House Journal |date=November–December 1987 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Phillips |first=Morgan W. |title=Adhesives for the Reattachment of Loose Plaster |journal=[[Bulletin of the Association for Preservation Technology]] |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=37–63 |doi=10.2307/1493739 |jstor=1493739}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contributions to [[historic paint analysis]] ranged from developing the technique of 'cratering' using sandpaper (to macroscopically reveal multiple paint layers), to the microscopic evaluation of paint cross-sections in situ and in the laboratory, to techniques meant to reverse the natural yellowing of linseed oil and thus reveal the 'true' colors of historic paints.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Morgan W. "Problems in the Restoration and Preservation of Old House Paints, Preservation and Conservation", In ''Principles and Practices. Proceedings of the North American International Regional Conference'', Williamsburg, Virginia, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, September 10–16. 1972. The Preservation Press, National Trust for Historic Preservation in the United States, (1976); ''Technology and Conservation'', vol. 1-4 (1976), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips was also among the first to investigate the properties of historic mortars, convening a landmark conference on the subject in Boston in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=SPNEA-APT Conference on Mortar, Boston, March 15-16, 1973 |journal=Bulletin of the Association for Preservation Technology |volume=6 |issue=1 |date=1974 |pages=9–39 |doi=10.2307/1493409 |jstor=1493409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
An undergraduate at [[Yale]], Phillips went on to become one of the first graduates from [[Columbia University]]'s pioneering MA program in Historic Preservation, founded in 1964 by [[James Marston Fitch]]. He began his career at SPNEA in the late 1960s as a Curatorial Assistant, and by 1971 was Supervisor of Buildings. With no formal training in science, technology, or craftsmanship, he sometimes referred to himself as an "alchemist". His expertise in architectural conservation developed largely through self-teaching and contacts made with art conservators, and in response to the necessity of preserving over 30 historic houses, dating from the 17th century to the 1930s, for which he was initially responsible. In time, and particularly as a result of his publications, coupled with the rise of the [[historic preservation]] movement in the 1970s, Phillips began to be in demand nationally as a consultant. This led SPNEA to establish a "Consulting Services Group" in 1974, built largely around his expertise and reputation, but also offering the services of an historical architect, Maximilian Ferro; a preservation scientist, Norman Weiss; and an architectural historian, Rick Detwiller; with David M. Hart as Director of Consulting Services, and  initially headquartered at the Society's [[Third Harrison Gray Otis House|Harrison Gray Otis House]] in Boston. Dr. Judith Selwyn, a materials scientist, joined the Group as an intern, as did researcher Sarah Chase. This Consulting Group worked closely, successfully pioneering the concept of multidisciplinary historic preservation services. In February 1977, however, the SPNEA became concerned with the liability of providing professional services as a non-profit, and Maximilian Ferro (under whose name and license all construction contracts were signed), was spun off to form The Preservation Partnership, a private multi-disciplinary firm. Dr. Selwyn followed later, forming her own consultancy in Preservation Science, while Sarah Chase, Rick Detwiller, David M. Hart, and Norman Weiss all pursued successful private practices.

==Later career==
By the mid-1980s Phillips had trained or attracted a number of other conservators to SPNEA, including Andy Ladygo, Brian Powell, and Gregory Clancey. The Consulting Services Group became the SPNEA Conservation Center, moved to the [[Lyman Estate]] in the Boston suburb of [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]]. Never an administrator, Phillips always concentrated on research and consulting. While the Center continued to be profitable, it never regained the prominence it had when administering architectural projects, and never again enjoyed the full support of the SPNEA, After protracted bureaucratic battles, it eventually closed in the early 1990s. Phillips went into private practice in Canajoharie, New York, but during a trip to examine Mayan ruins in Guatemala, he developed a ringing in his ears that exacerbated his long-standing struggle with manic depression. Phillips committed suicide at his home in [[Canajoharie (village), New York|Canajoharie, New York]], in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Obit., ''Boston Globe'', Nov. 2, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Phillips never married. He had an older brother, Reverend Wendell R. Phillips, and a sister, Andre Phillips. His nephew is the musician [[Jon Lindsay (musician)|Jon Lindsay]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10130">'''Muntanya Assolada''' is a [[Bronze Age]] settlement located on the right bank of the [[Xúquer]] river, in Spain, built on the top of a spur of the Corbera mountain range, dominating the river plain from a height of {{convert|227|m}} above sea level. It is located in the municipality of [[Alzira, Valencia]], Spain.

Excavation campaigns began in 1978, under the direction of [[Bernat Martí Oliver]], and continued until 1996, and work on the site was resumed in 2004. From the 1990s [[Rosa Enguix Alemany]] and [[María Jesús de Pedro]] joined the direction of the site. At present the excavated area covers {{convert|700|m2}} and includes different structures, like a central street and rectangular departments on both sides; a wall of two meters wide that preserves almost three meters of height ({{cvt|2|xx|3|m|ft|disp=out}}); occupancy soils and abandonment episodes; livestock stabling; and terracing of the slopes to expand its surface.

At present the site is property of the Alzira City council, and the new beginning of the excavations by the [[Servei d'Investigació Prehistòrica]] has as objective the consolidation of the exhumed structures and its signposting for visitor access.

A nearby [[burial cave]] indicates the continuity in the use of natural caves as necropolis, and an individual burial has been found in a pit in the interior of the area too. On the other hand, the recovered remains show a wide chronological sequence between the [[Early Bronze Age|Early Bronze]] and the [[Late Bronze Age|Late Bronze]].
[[File:Assolada_localización.jpg|thumb|Location of the Muntanya Assolada]]

== Location ==
On the right bank of the [[Xúquer]] river is located the Muntanya Assolada Bronze Age village of Alzira. The settlement was built on the top of a spur of the Corbera mountain range, west of Tallat Roig, between the Murta and the Aixavegó ravine, dominating the plain of the river from a height of 227 metres above sea level. The toponym "Muntanya Desolada" refers to the partial collapse of the summit that occurred in autumn of 1783, the night of 24–25 October. Until then the place was known as Muntanya de la Font del Baladre.
[[File:Muntanya_Assolada_muro.jpg|thumb|Wall area]]

== Archaeological interventions ==
The excavations carried out by the [[Servei d'Investigació Prehistòrica]] began in 1978 and continued until 1996, resuming again from 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://rua.ua.es/dspace/handle/10045/4497|title=Repositorio Institucional de la Universidad de Alicante |accessdate=9 March 2017 |author=|authorlink= |date= |language= |website=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area currently excavated covers more than {{cvt|700|m2}} and corresponds to different room structures with anthropic deposits and evidences of the different activities developed there, such as occupation soils and abandonment episodes in which fire was detected, perhaps due to the combustion of materials accumulated by livestock stabling, and terracing of the slopes to gradually expand the surface of the village. In its upper part, can be seen a central street and departments on both sides. In one of them it has been documented a domestic oven for cooking bread or toasting cereals. And in the other, the entrance has stone steps.

The site is surrounded by a wall that is almost two meters wide and stands three meters high ({{cvt|2|xx|3|m|ft|disp=out}}). It was built on a summit that has been terraced by solid stone and clay buildings arranged in slope, thus prolonging the settlement on the slope. The existence of different levels of occupation, documented by stratigraphy and remains, is corroborated by the remodeling of the structures, some of them quickly and intentionally filled to give way to new construction lines. However, it seems to indicate that it was inhabited continuously throughout the Bronze Age.
[[File:Muntanya_Assolada_cerámica.jpg |thumb|Ceramic pottery]]
[[File:Muntanya_Assolada_Puntas_Metall_.jpg|thumb|Metallic tips]]

== Archaeological remains ==
The remains are deposited in the [[Prehistory Museum of Valencia|Museu de Prehistòria de València]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.museuprehistoriavalencia.es/web_mupreva/sala/?q=fr&amp;id=119 |title=La Muntanya Assolada (Alzira, Valencia) |accessdate=9 March 2017 |last=Render |website= www.museuprehistoriavalencia.es }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery shows a variety of shapes, such as cups and bowls, pots and storage urns, fairing and geminated vessels, or spoons; and decorative motifs such as incisions, dots, typed strings, or burnished decoration. Among the metallic objects are gravers, arrowheads, a dagger of rivets, and a chisel, as well as other elements linked to the metallurgical activity, such as slags, a stone hammer and a ceramic crucible. The lithic industry has a good representation of sickle and flint arrowheads, polished stone tool and numerous remains of the lithic reductions. The bone industry is represented by gravers, spatulas and chisels, and by a ring and different ivory buttons. The fauna remains show the results of an agricultural village with sheep and goats predominating, the ox being used as an animal of draft and strength, and as a producer of meat and milk. Also the pig was raised, and there are remains of horse and dog. The hunt of the deer, beyond the necessary protection of the crops against herbivores, indicates the existence of a remarkable vegetation cover. The dating of a set of fauna from the lower layer of a space existing between the upper wall and a thickened structure, that is attached to it, has provided a date of 3470 ± 70 BP, between 1890&amp;nbsp;BC and 1690&amp;nbsp;BC.
[[File:Muntanya_Assolada_Enterrament_2.jpg |thumb|Human burial]]

== Human burials ==
The presence of human burials in the site is attested by the excavation of a small sepulchral cave immediately near the village, in the escarpment of its south-east side, which provided remains of a minimum of four individuals, animal bones and part of the grave goods that are with the buried. On the other side, in its westernmost southern slope, in the space delimited by a wide wall and by different stone courses that follow along the outer slope, a circular grave was excavated that contained another human burial, under a sedimentation of more than {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} of depth. The buried was in fetal position, right lateral decubitus, with the legs folded and the feet crossed. The right arm was elongated behind the back and the hand crushed by a block. The left arm was flexed in front of the body and the hand stretched below the face, missing most of the skull and upper maxilla. The absolute dating of this individual by C-14 has provided a date of 3760 ± 40 BP, between 2210&amp;nbsp;BC and 2130&amp;nbsp;BC.

== Relevance in its context ==
The Muntanya Assolada has been considered as a typical village of the Valencian Bronze Age, according to some decorative motifs of the pottery, globular and tall carena, the archaism of the lithic industry, the copper metallurgy, or the sepulchral cave found next to the village. The end of its habitation is related to the Late Bronze, attending to the fairing vessels with flared profile and with a pronounced angle of inflection, the flat bases or the presence of authentic bronze in the metallic objects. In fact, the typology of the vessels of Muntanya Assolada corresponds to what is usual in the villages of the Valencian Bronze Age. However, in their highest levels, such shapes as the mentioned fairing vessels are accompanied by the geminados, bowls and outgoing edge pots, considered more-evolved. The two absolute dates are shown in accordance with a sequence from the Early to the Late Bronze Age. La Muntanya Assolada and other nearby sites represent the continuity of a settlement that spans from the Bronze Age to the [[Iberian Culture]], in a permanently occupied territory such as the Ribera del [[Xúquer]].

The site was abandoned in the final period of the [[Middle Bronze Age]] or Late Bronze, to give way to a settlement located on the plain, first on Cases de Montcada, during the Late Bronze Age on Escoles Pies and during the [[Iron Age]] on the L'Alteret de la Vintihuitena of Albalat, to occupy later the slope of the highest hills with the arrival of the [[Iberian Culture]].

'''Nineteenth-century theatre''' describes a wide range of movements in the [[Theatre|theatrical]] [[culture]] of Europe and the United States in the 19th century. In the [[Western culture|West]], they include [[Romanticism]], [[melodrama]], the [[well-made play]]s of [[Eugène Scribe|Scribe]] and [[Victorien Sardou|Sardou]], the [[farce]]s of [[Georges Feydeau|Feydeau]], the [[problem play]]s of [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] and [[Realism (theatre)|Realism]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] [[opera]]tic ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'', [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s plays and operas, [[Oscar Wilde|Wilde's]] drawing-room comedies, [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], and proto-[[Expressionism]] in the late works of [[August Strindberg]] and [[Henrik Ibsen]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 293–426).&lt;/ref&gt;

Several important technical innovations were introduced between 1875 and 1914. First gas lighting and then electric lights, introduced in London's [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1881, replaced candlelight. The [[Elevator#Stage lifts|elevator stage]] was first installed in the [[Budapest]] Opera House in 1884. This allowed entire sections of the stage to be raised, lowered, or tilted to give depth and levels to the scene. The [[revolving stage]] was introduced to Europe by Karl Lautenschläger at the Residenz Theatre, [[Munich]] in 1896.

==Melodrama==
{{Main|Melodrama}}
[[File:Honoré Daumier 026.jpg|thumb|Honoré Daumier, ''Melodrama'', 1856-1860]]
Beginning in France after the theatre monopolies were abolished during the [[French Revolution]], [[melodrama]] became the most popular theatrical form of the century. Melodrama itself can be traced back to classical Greece, but the term ''mélodrame'' did not appear until 1766 and only entered popular usage sometime after 1800. The plays of [[August von Kotzebue]] and [[René Charles Guilbert de Pixérécourt]] established melodrama as the dominant dramatic form of the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 277).&lt;/ref&gt; Kotzebue in particular was the most popular playwright of his time, writing more than 215 plays that were produced all around the world. His play ''The Stranger'' (1789) is often considered the classic melodramatic play. Although monopolies and subsidies were reinstated under [[Napoleon]], theatrical melodrama continued to be more popular and brought in larger audiences than the state-sponsored [[drama]] and [[opera]]s.

Melodrama involved a plethora of [[Theatrical scenery|scenic effects]], an intensely emotional but codified acting style, and a developing stage technology that advanced the arts of theatre towards grandly spectacular staging. It was also a highly reactive form of theatre which was constantly changing and adapting to new social contexts, new audiences and new cultural influences. This, in part, helps to explains its popularity throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Booth (1995, 300).&lt;/ref&gt; David Grimsted, in his book ''Melodrama Unveiled'' (1968), argues that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Its conventions were false, its language stilted and commonplace, its characters stereotypes, and its morality and theology gross simplifications. Yet its appeal was great and understandable. It took the lives of common people seriously and paid much respect to their superior purity and wisdom. [...] And its moral parable struggled to reconcile social fears and life's awesomeness with the period's confidence in absolute moral standards, man's upward progress, and a benevolent providence that insured the triumph of the pure.&lt;ref&gt;Grimsted (1968, 248).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Paris, the 19th century saw a flourishing of melodrama in the many theatres that were located on the popular [[Boulevard du Crime]], especially in the [[Théâtre de la Gaîté (boulevard du Temple)|Gaîté]].  All this was to come to an end, however, when most of these theatres were demolished during the [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|rebuilding of Paris by Baron Haussmann]] in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatreonline.com/guide/detail_theatre.asp?i_Region=0&amp;i_Theatre=256#Le%20l'%E2ge%20d'or%20du%20Boulevard%20du%20Crime The golden age of the Boulevard du Crime] Theatre online.com (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, the term melodrama had nearly exclusively narrowed down to a specific [[genre]] of salon entertainment: more or less rhythmically spoken words (often poetry)—not sung, sometimes more or less enacted, at least with some dramatic structure or [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]—synchronized to an accompaniment of music (usually piano). It was looked down on as a genre for authors and composers of lesser stature (probably also the reason why virtually no realisations of the genre are still remembered).

==Romanticism in Germany and France==
{{See also|Romanticism}}
In Germany, there was a trend toward historical accuracy in [[Stage clothes|costumes]] and [[Set construction|settings]], a revolution in theatre architecture, and the introduction of the theatrical form of [[German Romanticism]]. Influenced by trends in [[19th-century philosophy]] and the [[visual arts]], German writers were increasingly fascinated with their [[Teutons|Teutonic]] past and had a growing sense of [[Romantic nationalism|nationalism]]. The plays of [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], and other ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' playwrights, inspired a growing faith in feeling and instinct as guides to moral behavior. Romantics borrowed from the [[German philosophy|philosophy]] of [[Immanuel Kant]] to formulate the theoretical basis of "Romantic" art. According to Romantics, art is of enormous significance because it gives eternal truths a concrete, material form that the limited human sensory apparatus may apprehend. Among [[List of romantics|those who called themselves Romantics]] during this period, [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] and [[Ludwig Tieck]] were the most deeply concerned with theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 278–280).&lt;/ref&gt; After a time, Romanticism was adopted in France with the plays of [[Victor Hugo]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Alfred de Musset]], and [[George Sand]]. 

Through the 1830s in France, the theatre struggled against the [[Comédie-Française|Comédie Française]], which maintained a strong [[Neoclassical theatre|neo-classical]] hold over the repertory and encouraged traditional modes of tragic writing in new playwrights. This clash culminated in the premiere of ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]] in 1830. The large crowd that attended the premiere was full of conservatives and censors who booed the show for disobeying the classical norms and who wanted to stop the performance from going forward. But Hugo organized a Romantic Army of bohemians and radical writers to ensure that the opening would have to go ahead. The resulting riot represented the rejection in France of the classical traditions and the triumph of Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nineteenth-century Theatre|last=Booth|first=Michael R|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 1840s, however, enthusiasm for Romantic drama had faded in France and a new "Theatre of Common Sense" replaced it.

==Well-made play==
{{Main|Well-made play}}
In France, the "[[well-made play]]" of [[Eugene Scribe]] (1791 - 1861) became popular with playwrights and audiences. First developed by Scribe in 1825, the form has a strong Neoclassical flavour, involving a tight plot and a climax that takes place close to the end of the play. The story depends upon a key piece of information kept from some characters, but known to others (and to the audience). A recurrent device that the well-made play employs is the use of letters or papers falling into unintended hands, in order to bring about plot twists and climaxes. The suspense and pace builds towards a climactic scene, in which the hero triumphs in an unforeseen reversal of fortune.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica Editors 2015"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Editors. "well-made play". Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 1 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scribe himself wrote over 400 plays of this type, utilizing what essentially amounted to a literary factory with writers who supplied the story, another the dialogue, a third the jokes and so on. Although he was highly prolific and popular, he was not without detractors: [[Théophile Gautier]] questioned how it could be that, "an author without poetry, lyricism, style, philosophy, truth or naturalism could be the most successful writer of his epoch, despite the opposition of literature and the critics?"&lt;ref&gt;Gautier, Histoire de l'art dramatique en France (1859), cited in Cardwell (1983), p. 876.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its structure was employed by realist playwrights [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], [[Emile Augier]], and [[Victorien Sardou]]. Sardou in particular was one of the world's most popular playwrights between 1860 and 1900. He adapted the well-made play to every dramatic type, from comedies to historical spectacles. In Britain, playwrights like [[Wilkie Collins]], [[Henry Arthur Jones]] and [[Arthur Pinero]] took up the genre, with Collins describing the well-made play as: “Make ’em laugh; make ’em weep; make ’em wait.” [[George Bernard Shaw]] thought that Sardou's plays epitomized the decadence and mindlessness into which the late 19th-century theatre had descended, a state that he labeled "Sardoodledom".&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica Editors 2015"/&gt;

==Theatre in Britain==
{{Main|Theatre of the United Kingdom}}
[[File:New Covent Garden Theatre Microcosm edited.jpg|left|thumb|Covent Garden Theatre in 1809.]]
In the early years of the 19th century, the [[Licensing Act 1737|Licensing Act]] allowed plays to be shown at only two theatres in [[London]] during the winter: [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]]. These two huge theatres contained two royal boxes, huge galleries, and a pit with benches where people could come and go during performances. Perhaps the most telling episode of the popularity of theatre in the early 19th century is the theatrical [[Old Price Riots|old price riots of 1809]]. After Convent Garden burned down, [[John Philip Kemble]], the theatre's manager, decided to raise prices in the pit, the boxes and the third tier. Audience members hated the new pricing which they thought denied them access to a national meeting place and led to three months of rioting until finally Kemble was forced to publicly apologize and lower prices again.&lt;ref name="Albert Museum 2015"&gt;''19th century theatre.'' Victoria and Albert Museum. Retrieved 1 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; To escape the restrictions, non-patent theatres along the [[Strand, London|Strand]], like the [[Adelphi Theatre|Sans Pareil]], interspersed dramatic scenes with musical interludes and comic skits after the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]] allowed them to stage [[Burletta|burlettas]]—leading to the formation of the modern [[West End theatre|West End]]. Outside of the metropolitan area of London, theatres like [[Astley's Amphitheatre]] and the [[The Old Vic|Coburg]] were also able to operate outside of the rules. The exploding popularity of these forms began to make the patent system unworkable and the boundaries between the two began to blur through the 1830s until finally the Licensing Act was dropped in 1843 with the [[Theatres Act 1843|Theatres Act]]. Parliament hoped that this would civilize the audiences and lead to more literate playwrighting—instead, it created an explosion of [[Music hall|music halls]], [[Comedy|comedies]] and sensationalist melodramas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/19th-century-theatre|title=Theatre in the 19th century|last=Bratton|first=Jacky|date=15 Mar 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 Mar 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton by Henry William Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]].]]
[[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and [[Lord Byron]] were the most important literary dramatists of their time (although Shelley's plays were not performed until later in the century). Shakespeare was enormously popular, and began to be performed with texts closer to the original, as the drastic rewriting of 17th and 18th century performing versions for the theatre were gradually removed over the first half of the century. Kotzebue's plays were translated into English and [[Thomas Holcroft]]'s ''A Tale of Mystery'' was the first of many English melodramas. [[Pierce Egan]], [[Douglas William Jerrold]], [[Edward Fitzball]], [[James Roland MacLaren]] and [[John Baldwin Buckstone]] initiated a trend towards more contemporary and rural stories in preference to the usual historical or fantastical melodramas. [[James Sheridan Knowles]] and [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] established a "gentlemanly" drama that began to re-establish the former prestige of the theatre with the [[aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 297–298).&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Henry Irving portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Irving portrait]]
Theatres throughout the century were dominated by [[actor-manager]]s who managed the establishments and often acted in the lead roles. [[Henry Irving]], [[Charles Kean]] and [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] are all examples of managers who created productions in which they were the star performer. Irving especially dominated the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] for almost 30 years from 1871 - 1899 and was hero-worshipped by his audiences. When he died in 1905, King [[Edward VII]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] send their condolences. Among these actor-managers, Shakespeare was often the most popular writer as his plays afforded them great dramatic opportunity and name recognition. The stage spectacle of these productions was often more important than the play and texts were often cut to give maximum exposure to the leading roles. However, they also introduced significant reforms into the theatrical process. For example, [[William Charles Macready]] was the first to introduce proper [[rehearsal]]s to the process. Before this lead actors would rarely rehearse their parts with the rest of the cast: [[Edmund Kean]]'s most famous direction to his fellow actors being, "stand upstage of me and do your worst."&lt;ref name="Albert Museum 2015"/&gt;

Melodramas, light comedies, operas, Shakespeare and classic English drama, [[pantomimes]], translations of French farces and, from the 1860s, French operettas, continued to be popular, together with [[Victorian burlesque]]. The most successful dramatists were [[James Planché]] and [[Dion Boucicault]], whose penchant for making the latest scientific inventions important elements in his plots exerted considerable influence on theatrical production.  His first big success, ''[[London Assurance]]'' (1841) was a comedy in the style of Sheridan, but he wrote in various styles, including melodrama. [[T. W. Robertson]] wrote popular domestic comedies and introduced a more naturalistic style of acting and stagecraft to the British stage in the 1860s.

In 1871, the producer [[John Hollingshead]] brought together the librettist [[W. S. Gilbert|W.S. Gilbert]] and the composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] to create a Christmas entertainment, unwittingly spawning one of the great duos of theatrical history. So successful were the 14 [[comic opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], such as ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878) and ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), that they had a huge influence over the development of [[musical theatre]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 326–327).&lt;/ref&gt; This, together with much improved street lighting and transportation in London and New York led to a late Victorian and Edwardian theatre building boom in the West End and on Broadway.  At the end of the century, [[Edwardian musical comedy]] came to dominate the musical stage.&lt;ref name="What are EdMusComs?"&gt;The first "Edwardian musical comedy" is usually considered to be ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892). See, e.g., Charlton, Fraser. [http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/fraser.charlton/edmuscom/page12/edmuscom_what.html "What are EdMusComs?"] FrasrWeb 2007, accessed May 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s, the comedies of [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] offered sophisticated social comment and were very popular.

==Theatre in the United States==
{{Main|Theater of the United States}}
In the [[Theater of the United States|United States]], [[Philadelphia]] was the dominant theatrical centre until the 1820s. There, [[Thomas Wignell]] established the [[Chestnut Street Theatre]] and gathered a group of actors and playwrights that included [[William Warren (elder actor)|William Warren]], [[Susanna Rowson]], and Thomas Abthorpe Cooper, who later was considered the leading actor in North America. In its infancy after the [[American Revolution]], many Americans lamented the lack of a 'native drama', even while playwrights such as [[Royall Tyler]], [[William Dunlap]], [[James Nelson Barker]], [[John Howard Payne]], and [[Samuel Woodworth]] laid the foundations for an American drama separate from Britain. Part of the reason for the dearth of original plays in this period may be that playwrights were rarely paid for their work and it was much cheaper for managers to adapt or translate foreign work. Tradition held that remuneration was mainly in the form of a benefit performance for the writer on the third night of a run, but many managers would skirt this custom by simply closing the show before the third performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the American Drama: From the Beginning to the Civil War|last=Quinn|first=Arthur Hobson|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|year=1923|isbn=|location=|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as the "Father of the American Drama", Dunlap grew up watching plays given by British officers and was heavily immersed in theatrical culture while living in London just after the Revolution. As the manager of the [[John Street Theatre (Manhattan)|John Street Theatre]] and [[Park Theatre (Manhattan)|Park Theatre]] in [[New York City|New York]], he brought back to his country the plays and theatrical values that he had seen. Like many playwright-managers of his day, Dunlap adapted or translated melodramatic works by French of German playwrights, but he also wrote some 29 original works including ''[[The Father (Dunlap play)|The Father]]'' (1789)'', [[André (play)|André]]'' (1798), and ''[[The Italian Father]]'' (1799).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the American Drama: from the Beginning to the Civil War|last=Quinn|first=Arthur Hobson|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|year=1923|isbn=|location=|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1820-30, improvements in the material conditions of American life and the growing demand of a rising middle class for entertainment led to the construction of new theatres in New York, Philadelphia, [[Boston]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], including [[Chatham Garden Theatre|Catham Garden]], [[Federal Street Theatre|Federal Street]] , the [[Tremont Theatre, Boston (1889)|Tremont]], [[Niblo's Garden]] and the [[Bowery Theatre|Bowery]]. During the early part of this period, Philadelphia continued to be the major theatrical centre: plays would often open in [[Baltimore]] in September or October before transferring to larger theatres in Philadelphia until April or May, followed by a summer season in Washington or [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]]. However, rivalries and larger economic forces led to a string of bankruptcies for five major theatre companies in just eight months between October 1, 1828 and May 27, 1829. Due to this and the import of [[Star system (filmmaking)|star system]] performers like [[Clara Fisher]], New York took over as the dominant city in American theatre.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Edwin Forrest as Spartacus.jpg|thumb|Edwin Forrest as Spartacus in ''The Gladiator.'']]
In the 1830s, [[Romanticism]] flourished in Europe and America with writers like [[Robert Montgomery Bird]] rising to the forefront. Since Romanticism emphasized eternal truths and nationalistic themes, it fit perfectly with the emerging national identity of the United States. Bird's ''[[The Gladiator (1831 play)|The Gladiator]]'' was well-received when it premiered in 1831 and was performed at Drury Lane in London in 1836 with [[Edwin Forrest]] as Spartacus, with ''The Courier'' proclaiming that "America has at length vindicated her capability of producing a dramatist of the highest order." Dealing with slave insurgency in [[Ancient Rome]], ''The Gladiator'' implicitly attacks the institution of [[Slavery in the United States]] by “transforming the [[Antebellum United States|Antebellum]] into neoclassical rebels”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=Peter|date=|title=Slave Revolt and Classical Blackness in The Gladiator|url=|journal=Rogue Performances: Staging the Underclasses in Early American Theatre Culture|volume=|pages=151|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forrest would continue to play the role for over one thousand performances around the world until 1872. Following the success of their early collaboration, Bird and Forrest would work together on further premieres of ''Oralloosa, Son of the Incas'' and ''The Broker of Bogota''. But the success of ''The Gladiator'' led to contract disagreements, with Bird arguing that Forrest, who had made tens of thousands from Bird's plays, owed him more than the $2,000 he had been paid.

[[Minstrel show]]s emerged as brief [[American burlesque|burlesques]] and comic [[Entr'acte|entr'actes]] in the early 1830s. They were developed into full-fledged form in the next decade. By 1848, blackface minstrel shows were the national art form, translating formal art such as opera into popular terms for a general audience. Each show consisted of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music performances that mocked people specifically of African descent. The shows were performed by Caucasians in make-up or [[blackface]] for the purpose of playing the role of [[black people]]. Minstrel songs and sketches featured several [[Stock character|stock characters]], most popularly the [[History of slavery in the United States|slave]] and the [[dandy]]. These were further divided into sub-archetypes such as the [[Mammy archetype|mammy]], her counterpart the old [[List of ethnic slurs#D|darky]], the provocative [[mulatto]] [[wench]], and the black soldier. Minstrels claimed that their songs and dances were authentically black, although the extent of the black influence remains debated.

Star actors amassed an immensely loyal following, comparable to modern celebrities or sports stars. At the same time, audiences had always treated theaters as places to make their feelings known, not just towards the actors, but towards their fellow theatergoers of different classes or political persuasions, and theatre [[Riot|riots]] were a regular occurrence in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898|last=Burrows|first=Edwin G. &amp; Wallace, Mike|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-195-11634-8|location=New York|pages=761}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the power of these stars is the [[Astor Place Riot]] in 1849, which was caused by a conflict between the American star Edwin Forrest and the English actor [[William Macready|William Charles Macready]]. The riot pitted immigrants and [[Nativism (politics)|nativists]] against each other, leaving at least 25 dead and more than 120 injured.

In the pre-Civil War era, there were also many types of more political drama staged across the United States. As America pushed [[American frontier|west]] in the 1830s and 40s, theatres began to stage plays that romanticized and masked treatment of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] like ''[[Pocahontas]]'', ''The Pawnee Chief, De Soto'' and ''[[Metamora; or, The Last of the Wampanoags|Metamora or the Last of the Wampanoags]].'' Some fifty of these plays were produced between 1825 and 1860, including [[burlesque]] performances of the "noble savage" by [[John Brougham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the American Drama|last=Quinn|first=Arthur Hobson|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|year=1923|isbn=|location=|pages=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reacting off of current events, many playwrights wrote short comedies that dealt with the major issues of the day. For example, ''Removing the Deposits'' was a farce produced in 1835 at the Bowery in reaction to [[Andrew Jackson]]'s battle with the banks and ''Whigs and Democrats, or Love of No Politics'' was a play that dealt with the struggle between America's two political parties.

In 1852, [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] published the anti-slavery novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' and, without any strong copyright laws, was immediately dramatized on stages across the country. At the [[National Theatre (New York, 1836)|National Theatre]] in New York, it was a huge success and ran for over two hundred performances up to twelve times per week until 1854. The adaptation by [[George Aiken (playwright)|George Aiken]] was a six-act production that stood on its own, without an other entertainments or afterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Staging the Nation: Plays from the American Theater, 1787–1909|last=Wilmeth|first=Don B.|publisher=Bedford Books|year=1998|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minstrelsy's reaction to ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' is indicative of [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] content at the time. ''Tom acts'' largely came to replace other plantation narratives, particularly in the third act. These sketches sometimes supported Stowe's novel, but just as often they turned it on its head or attacked the author. Whatever the intended message, it was usually lost in the joyous, slapstick atmosphere of the piece. Characters such as Simon Legree sometimes disappeared, and the title was frequently changed to something more cheerful like "Happy Uncle Tom" or "Uncle Dad's Cabin". [[Uncle Tom]] himself was frequently portrayed as a harmless bootlicker to be ridiculed. Troupes known as ''Tommer''companies specialized in such burlesques, and theatrical ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Tom shows|Tom shows]]'' integrated elements of the minstrel show and competed with it for a time.

New York City's importance as a theatrical center grew until it became the primary theatre center during the century, and the [[Theater District]] slowly moved north from lower Manhattan until it finally arrived in midtown at the end of the century.  On the musical stage, [[Edward Harrigan|Harrigan and Hart]] innovated with comic musical plays from the 1870s, but London imports came to dominate, beginning with [[Victorian burlesque]], then [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] from 1880, and finally [[Edwardian musical comedies]] at the end of the century.&lt;ref name="What are EdMusComs?"/&gt;

==Meiningen Ensemble and Richard Wagner==
{{Main|Meiningen Ensemble|Richard Wagner}}
In Germany, drama entered a state of decline from which it did not recover until the 1890s. The major playwrights of the period were [[Otto Ludwig (writer)|Otto Ludwig]] and [[Gustav Freytag]]. The lack of new dramatists was not keenly felt because the plays of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Lessing, Goethe, and Schiller were prominent in the repertory. The most important theatrical force in later 19th-century Germany was that of [[Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen]] and his [[Meiningen Ensemble]], under the direction of [[Ludwig Chronegk]]. The Ensemble's productions are often considered the most historically accurate of the 19th century, although his primary goal was to serve the interests of the playwright. The Ensemble's productions utilised detailed, historically accurate costumes and furniture, something that was unprecedented in Europe at the time. The Meiningen Ensemble stands at the beginning of the new movement toward unified production (or what [[Richard Wagner]] would call the ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'') and the rise of the [[theatre director|director]] (at the expense of the actor) as the dominant artist in theatre-making.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 357–359).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Meiningen Ensemble]] traveled throughout Europe from 1874–1890 and met with unparalleled success wherever they went. Audiences had grown tired with regular, shallow entertainment theatre and were beginning to demand a more creatively and intellectually stimulating form of expression that the Ensemble was able to provide. Therefore, the Meiningen Ensemble can be seen as the forerunners of the art-theatre movement which appeared in Europe at the end of the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer-Lichte (2001, 245)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Wagner]] (1813–1883) rejected the contemporary trend toward realism and argued that the dramatist should be a [[myth]] maker who portrays an [[utopia|ideal world]] through the expression of inner impulses and aspirations of a people. Wagner used [[music]] to defeat performers' personal whims. The [[melody]] and [[tempo]] of music allowed him to have greater personal control over performance than he would with spoken drama. As with the Meininger Ensemble, Wagner believed that the author-[[composer]] should supervise every aspect of production to unify all the elements into a "[[Gesamtkunstwerk|master art work]]."&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 378).&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner also introduced a new type of [[auditorium]] that abolished the side boxes, pits, and galleries that were a prominent feature of most European theatres and replaced them with a 1,745 seat fan-shaped auditorium that was {{convert|50|ft|m}} wide at the [[proscenium]] and {{convert|115|ft|m}} at the rear. This allowed every seat in the auditorium to enjoy a full view of the stage and meant that there were no "good" seats.

==Rise of realism in Russia==
{{Main|Realism (theatre)}}
In [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Aleksandr Griboyedov]], [[Alexander Pushkin]], and [[Nikolai Polevoy]] were the most accomplished playwrights. As elsewhere, Russia was dominated by melodrama and [[musical theatre]]. More [[Realism (theatre)|realistic drama]] began to emerge with the plays of [[Nikolai Gogol]] and the acting of [[Mikhail Shchepkin]]. Under close government supervision, the Russian theatre expanded considerably. Prince [[Alexander Shakhovskoy]] opened state theatres and training schools, attempted to raise the level of Russian production after a trip to Paris, and put in place regulations for governing troupes that remained in effect until 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 293).&lt;/ref&gt;

Realism began earlier in the 19th century in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] than elsewhere in Europe and took a more uncompromising form.&lt;ref name=BH370&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 370).&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the plays of [[Ivan Turgenev]] (who used "domestic detail to reveal inner turmoil"), [[Aleksandr Ostrovsky]] (who was Russia's first professional playwright), [[Aleksey Pisemsky]] (whose ''[[A Bitter Fate]]'' (1859) anticipated [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]]), and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (whose ''[[The Power of Darkness]]'' (1886) is "one of the most effective of naturalistic plays"), a tradition of psychological realism in Russia culminated with the establishment of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 370, 372) and Benedetti (2005, 100) and (1999, 14–17).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ostrovsky is often credited with creating a peculiarly Russian drama. His plays ''[[Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man]]'' (1868) and ''[[The Storm (Ostrovsky)|The Storm]]'' (1859) draw on the life that he knew best, that of the middle class. Other important Russian playwrights of the 19th century include [[Alexander Sukhovo-Kobylin]] and Mikhail Saltikov-Shchedrin.

==Naturalism and Realism==
[[File:Ibsen-by-Bergen.jpg|thumb|[[Henrik Ibsen]], the "father" of modern drama.]]
{{Main|Naturalism (theatre)|Realism (theatre)}}
[[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]], a theatrical movement born out of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859) and contemporary political and economic conditions, found its main proponent in [[Émile Zola]]. His essay "Naturalism in the Theatre" (1881) argued that poetry is everywhere instead of in the past or abstraction: "There is more poetry in the little apartment of a [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] than in all the empty worm-eaten palaces of history."

The realisation of Zola's ideas was hindered by a lack of capable dramatists writing naturalist drama. [[André Antoine]] emerged in the 1880s with his ''[[Théâtre Libre]]'' that was only open to members and therefore was exempt from censorship. He quickly won the approval of Zola and began to stage Naturalistic works and other foreign realistic pieces. Antoine was unique in his set design as he built sets with the "[[fourth wall]]" intact, only deciding which wall to remove later. The most important French playwrights of this period were given first hearing by Antoine including Georges Porto-Riche, [[François de Curel]], and [[Eugène Brieux]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 362–363).&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of [[Henry Arthur Jones]] and [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] initiated a new direction on the English stage. While their work paved the way, the development of more significant drama owes itself most to the playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]].

Ibsen was born in Norway in 1828. He wrote 25 plays, the most famous of which are ''[[A Doll's House]]'' (1879), ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' (1881), ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884), and ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1890). ''A Doll's House'' and ''Ghosts'' shocked conservatives: Nora's departure in ''A Doll's House'' was viewed as an attack on family and home, while the allusions to venereal disease and sexual misconduct in ''Ghosts'' were considered deeply offensive to standards of public decency. Ibsen refined Scribe's well-made play formula to make it more fitting to the realistic style. He provided a model for writers of the realistic school. In addition, his works ''[[Rosmersholm]]'' (1886) and ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'' (1899) evoke a sense of mysterious forces at work in human destiny, which was to be a major theme of [[Symbolism (arts)#Theatre|symbolism]] and the so-called "[[Theatre of the Absurd]]".

After Ibsen, British theatre experienced revitalization with the work of [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Oscar Wilde]], and (in fact from 1900) [[John Galsworthy]].  Unlike most of the gloomy and intensely serious work of their contemporaries, Shaw and Wilde wrote primarily in the [[Comedy (drama)|comic form]].

==Technological Changes==
{{Main|Nineteenth-century theatrical scenery}}

===Stage lighting===
The eighteenth century theatre had been lit by candles and oil-lamps which were mainly provided for illumination so that the audience could see the performance, with no further purpose. This changed in the early 19th century with the introduction of [[gas lighting]] which was slowly adopted by the major theatres throughout the 1810s and 1820s to provide illumination for the house and the stage. The introduction of gas lighting revolutionized stage lighting. It provided a somewhat more natural and adequate light for the playing and the scenic space upstage of the proscenium arch. While there was no way to control the gas lights, this was soon to change as well. In Britain, theatres in London developed [[limelight]] for the stage in the late 1830s. In Paris, the [[Arc lamp|electric carbon arc lamp]] first came into use in the 1840s. Both of these types of lighting were able to be hand-operated and could be focused by means of an attached lens, thus giving the theatre an ability to focus light on particular performers for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Booth (1995, 302)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1880s onwards, theatres began to be gradually electrified with the [[Savoy Theatre]] becoming the first theatre in the world to introduce a fully electrified theatrical lighting system in 1881. [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], who built the Savoy, explained why he had introduced electric light: "The greatest drawbacks to the enjoyment of the theatrical performances are, undoubtedly, the foul air and heat which pervade all theatres. As everyone knows, each gas-burner consumes as much oxygen as many people, and causes great heat beside. The incandescent lamps consume no oxygen, and cause no perceptible heat."&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the introduction of electric light coincided with the rise of realism: the new forms of lighting encouraged more realistic scenic detail and a subtler, more realistic acting style.&lt;ref&gt;Booth (1995, 303)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scenic design===
One of the most important scenic transition into the century was from the often-used two-dimensional scenic backdrop to three-dimensional sets. Previously, as a two-dimensional environment, scenery did not provide an embracing, physical environment for the dramatic action happening on stage. This changed when three-dimensional sets were introduced in the first half of the century. This, coupled with change in audience and stage dynamic as well as advancement in theatre architecture that allowed for hidden scene changes, the theatre became more representational instead of presentational, and invited audience to be transported to a conceived 'other' world. The early 19th century also saw the innovation of the moving panorama: a setting painted on a long cloth, which could be unrolled across the stage by turning spools, created an illusion of movement and changing locales.&lt;ref&gt;Baugh (2005, 11-33)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Barnet Burns in Maori costume.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Barnet Burns in Maori clothing, image from [[National Library of Australia]] ]]
Māori kept some Pākehā as [[Slavery |slaves]], while others -  many of them runaway seamen or escaped convicts - settled in Māori communities by choice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/cultural-go-betweens/2 "Cultural go-betweens, Pākehā–Māori"], Te Ara&lt;/ref&gt; They often found a welcome, took wives and were treated as Māori, particularly in the first two decades of the 19th century. The rarity of Europeans in New Zealand and the importance of trade in European goods (particularly muskets) made Pākehā Māori highly prized for their trading skills. Some achieved a degree of prestige among the Māori and fought in battle with their adopted ''[[iwi]]'' (tribes) in the [[New Zealand land wars]] of 1845 to 1872, sometimes against European soldiers. While some lived the rest of their lives amongst Māori, others, such as the lapsed [[missionary]] [[Thomas Kendall]], did so only briefly.

A few Pākehā Māori such as [[James Caddell]], John Rutherford&lt;ref name=railways&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Gov13_08Rail-t1-body-d7.html "John Rutherford — The “White New Zealander”"], A.J. Waldie&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barnet Burns]] even received [[Tā moko|''moko'']] (facial tattoos). 

As more Europeans arrived, the status of early Europeans among Māori fell, and some of the early Pākehā Māori reverted to a more European existence. 

In 1862 and 1863, the early settler [[Frederick Edward Maning]] published two books under the pseudonym "A Pakeha Maori" in which he describes how they lived.

'''Reinhold Curicke''' (12 January 1610 – 2 April 1667) was a jurist and historian from [[Danzig]] (Gdańsk) &lt;!-- "In biographies of clearly German persons, the name should be used in the form Danzig (Gdańsk) and later Danzig exclusively" --&gt; who specialized in the [[History of Gdańsk|history of the city]], including its past as principal city of province of [[Royal Prussia]] in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Stone,''A History of East Central Europe'', University of Washington Press, 2001, p. 30, {{ISBN|0-295-98093-1}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22Royal+prussia%22+Poland+1466+Elbl%C4%85g&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;hl=pl Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; and its connections with [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] merchant organization.

In 1645, Curicke published a [[German language]] four-volume work: ''Der Stadt Danzig historische Beschreibung ...''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4122">The traditional '''Romanian''' calendar has its own names for the '''[[month]]s''', which are otherwise identical to those of the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In modern [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], the latter exclusively is used for business and government transactions, and predominates in popular use as well. Nevertheless, the traditional names of the months do appear in some contexts, for instance on ecclesiastical calendars produced by the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]].

All the names of the months are of [[Latin]] origin, which indicates that their use predates the Slavic contact around the 8th century. Six months have their names derived from characteristics of the months. Five are derived from the Latin names now used in the Gregorian calendar (and earlier in the [[Julian calendar]]). However, each of these has a folk etymology and an additional meaning. The last month, December, derives its name from that of [[Saint Andrew]].

'''Dom Rosendo Salvado Rotea''' [[Order of Saint Benedict|OSB]] (1 March 1814 – 29 December 1900) was a Spanish [[Benedictine]] monk, missionary, bishop, author, founder and first [[Abbot]] of the Territorial Abbey of [[New Norcia]], in Western Australia.

==Early life and background==
Salvado was born at [[Tui, Galicia|Tui]], Galicia, Spain and at the age of 15 entered the Benedictine Abbey of San Martin at [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]]. He was clothed in the [[Religious habit|habit]] in 1829 and took his final vows in 1832. In 1835, he was forced to flee to the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], after the Anti-Catholic government of [[Ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendizábal|Juan Álvarez Mendizábal]] decreed the closing of all monasteries and the secularization of monks as a result of the [[First Carlist War]]. He was received into the Abbey of [[Trinità della Cava]], near [[Naples]], where he was ordained to the [[priesthood]] in February 1839.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web |author=William, Dom |title=Salvado, Rosendo (1814–1900) |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |publisher=National Centre of Biography, [[Australian National University]] |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/salvado-rosendo-2627/text3635 |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
Strongly desiring to labor in the foreign missions, his wish was granted after [[John Brady (bishop of Perth)|John Brady]] was consecrated as first [[Bishop (Catholicism)|Bishop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Perth|Diocese of Perth]]. With his longtime friend Father [[Joseph Serra]] OSB, Salvado sailed from London with the Bishop's party and landed in [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] in January 1846. At Brady's instruction, Salvado and Serra, alongside a small party of their fellow Benedictines, journeyed deep into the [[Shire of Victoria Plains|Victoria Plains]] via ox drawn cart. On 1 March 1846, they founded "The Central Mission" in the midst of the bush, intending to convert the [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] to Catholicism. This was later renamed "New Norcia," after the birthplace of [[St. Benedict]].&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

The priests soon established relations with the Aborigines, but conditions at the Mission proved so harsh that soon only Salvado and Serra remained. Salvado was an accomplished musician and in the first year of the mission he travelled back to Perth and on 21 May 1846 gave a well received piano recital in tattered robes in the hall of the Courthouse. The recital raised much needed funds for provisioning the new mission.&lt;ref&gt;The Salvado Memoirs, Benedictine Community of New Norcia Inc, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1848, Serra was appointed Bishop of [[Port Essington]] in the [[Northern Territory]] and later to [[Coadjutor bishop|Coadjutor]] of the Diocese of Perth. In 1849, Salvado sailed for Europe to raise funds for the Mission, accompanied by two young Aboriginal boys, Joseph Conaci and Francis Dirimera. Salvado was consecrated Bishop of Port Essington in August of that year, much against his will, as he strongly desired to return to New Norcia. After Port Essington was abandoned, however, he was left as a Bishop without a [[Episcopal see|See]].&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

While waiting permission to return to Australia, he wrote and published ''Memorie Storiche dell' Australia'' in March 1851. This book, which chronicled the beginnings of the Mission and his relations with the Aborigines, went through multiple printings in Italian, Spanish, and French. It was published in English in 1977.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

==Later life==
He returned to Australia in 1853, accompanied by a large number of priests and monks bound for the Australian Missions and especially for New Norcia. For four years he administered the Diocese of Perth during Bishop Serra's absence in Europe. He returned to New Norcia in 1857. In the following years he shifted the focus of the Mission to serving the White settlers who were pouring into the area. In 1866 he was nominated as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Perth|Bishop of Perth]], but convinced Vatican authorities that his true vocation lay with aborigines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=Rosendo|Last=Salvado|shortlink=0-dict-biogSa-Sp.html|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, he was appointed "Lord Abbot" and the Mission was upgraded to an independent Abbey by [[Papal decree]]. He died in 1900 at the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], while on a visit to Rome. His body was returned to New Norcia three years later and buried in a tomb of [[Carrara marble]] behind the high altar of the Abbey church.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newnorcia.wa.edu.au/protecting-a-unique-heritage/the-story-of-new-norcia/the-salvado-era.html |title=The Salvado Era: 1846 - 1900 |work=The Story of New Norcia |publisher=New Norcia Benedictine Community |year=2011 |accessdate=14 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4559">'''Seán Mór Ó Dubhagáin''' (died [[1372 in Ireland|1372]]) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Irish language|Gaelic]] [[poet]].

==Background==

[[Ó Dubhagáinn]] was among the first notable members of the bardic family Baile Uí Dhubhagáin (Ballyduggan), near [[Loughrea]], [[County Galway]]. He was accorded the rank [[ollamh]] [[seanchai]] (professional historian) to the [[Uí Maine]] recorded Irish clan history up until the [[Normans|Norman]] invasion of Ireland.

==His work==

Ó Dubhagáin's most important work is ''[[Triallam timcheall na Fodla]]'', a compilation of verse, giving the names of the various tribes, dynasties and territories of the Irish, and the various chiefs before the coming of the Normans. He devotes 152 lines to [[County Meath|Meath]], 354 to [[Ulster]], 328 to [[Connacht]], and only 56 to [[Leinster]], possibly unfinished at his death.

''Triamllam'' is notable, in that he writes as though the Norman invasion never occurred, and as if many of the families listed still occupied their original territories. This, however, may reflect his interest as an [[antiquarian]] preserving ancient [[Folklore|lore]].

His contemporary, [[Giolla na Naomh Ó hUidhrín]] (died 1420), completed it. In ''Cambrensis Eversus'', [[John Lynch (Irish historian)|John Lynch]] says that he could not find "any better source than this remarkable poem" concerning the chief Irish families before the coming of the English. Ó Dubhagáin was the author of several other extant poems, all more or less in the nature of a [[memoria]] technica, valuable chiefly for their facts about the kings of Ireland and of the provinces. They include:

* ''Righnaid Laigean Clan Cathaoir'', on the families descended from King [[Cathair Mór]] of [[Leinster]].
* ''Cashil cathain clana Mogh'', a catalogue of the kings of [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]] from c.300 to 1367.

At least three other poems by him are extant, amounting to several hundreds of verses.

He also composed several rules for determining [[moveable feast]]s.

He was the teacher of [[Adhamh Ó Cianáin]], who composed [[Leabhar Adhamh Ó Cianáin]], in or about the 1340s. Ó Cianáin stated that he wrote it by and for himself, and out of a book of his teacher.

==Death and place of burial==

Ó Dubhagáin made a pilgrimage to [[St. Columba]]’s tomb and lived the rest of his life at a monastery on Loughrea, although other sources state he died at the [[monastery]] of [[Boyle, County Roscommon|Boyle]] in [[County Roscommon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/index.htm] Bio at Ricorso.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Others of the Name==

The surname is generally now rendered [[Dugan]]. Notables of the name include:

* [[Patrick Duggan]] (10 November 1813 – 15 August 1896) Roman Catholic Bishop of [[Clonfert]].
* [[Tomás Bacach Ó Dúgáin]], (fl. 1848-1858), scribe.

The '''Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings''' ('''SPAB''') (sometimes known as '''Anti-Scrape'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=E. P.|last=Thompson|authorlink=E. P. Thompson|year=1976|title=William Morris: Romantic to Revolutionary|publisher=Pantheon|quote=The Society, which Morris dubbed "Anti-Scrape...|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=0-394-73320-7|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[amenity society]] founded by [[William Morris]], [[Philip Webb]] and others, in 1877; to oppose what they saw as destructive 'restoration' of ancient buildings then occurring in [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[England]]; 'ancient' being used in the wider sense of 'very old' rather than the more usual modern one of 'pre-[[medieval]]'.

Morris was particularly concerned about the practice, which he described as 'forgery', of attempting to return functioning buildings to an idealised state from the distant past, which often involved the removal of elements added in their later development, and which Morris saw as contributing to their interest as documents of the past.  Instead, he proposed that ancient buildings should be repaired, not restored, so that their entire history would be protected as [[cultural heritage]].  Today, these principles are widely accepted.

==Organisation and activities==
Today, the SPAB still operates according to Morris's original manifesto.  It campaigns, advises, runs training programmes and courses, conducts research and publishes information.  As one of the [[Amenity society|National Amenity Societies]], the Society is a statutory consultee on alterations to [[Listed Building|listed buildings]], and by law must be notified of any application in England and Wales to demolish in whole or part any listed building.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]]|title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015|date=24 March 2015|url=https://www.GOV.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015|website=www.GOV.uk|publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom|HM Government]]|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It currently has c. 8,500 members (2012).  The Society also has a branch in [[Scotland]].

The society's Mills Section is the only British national body concerned with the protection, repair and continued use of traditional [[windmill]]s and [[watermill]]s; [[Ken Major]] carried out much work on its behalf.

The society, which is a registered charity, is based at 37 [[Spitalfields|Spital Square]], [[London|LONDON]] [[London E1|E1]] 6DY, [[England]].

For its dedicated service to heritage, the society was awarded the [[European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Awards|European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://EuropaNostra.org/laureates-2012/|title=2012 EU Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Awards – Category 3 - Dedicated service|website=EuropaNostra.org|publisher=[[Europa Nostra]]|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://EuropaNostra.org/awards/89/|title=The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB)|website=EuropaNostra.org|publisher=[[Europa Nostra]]|date=20 March 2012|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-254_en.htm|title=Winners of 2012 EU Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Awards announced|website=Europa.eu|publisher=[[European Commission]] - press release|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sothic cycle''' or '''Canicular period''' is a period of 1,461 [[Egyptian civil year]]s of 365 days each or 1,460 [[Julian calendar|Julian years]] averaging 365¼ days each. During a Sothic cycle, the 365-day year loses enough time that the start of its year once again coincides with the [[heliacal rising]] of the star [[Sirius]] ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:spdt|Spdt]]}} or ''[[Sopdet]]'', "Triangle"; {{lang-grc-gre|Σῶθις}}, ''Sō̂this'') on 19 July in the [[Julian calendar]].&lt;ref name=lavia/&gt;{{efn|The date slowly varies within the [[Gregorian calendar]], owing to its omission of three leap years every four centuries.

[[Egyptian astronomy|Astronomical records]] of this displacement may have been responsible for the later establishment of the more accurate [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Alexandrian calendar]]s.

==Mechanics==
The [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian calendar|civil year]], its holidays, and religious records reflect its apparent establishment at a point when the [[heliacal rising|return]] of the bright star [[Sirius (star)|Sirius]] to the night sky was considered to herald the [[flooding of the Nile|annual flooding]] of the [[Nile]].&lt;ref name=teacosy/&gt; However, because the civil calendar was exactly 365 days long and did not incorporate [[leap year]]s until 22{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, its months "wandered" backwards through the [[solar year]] at the rate of about one day in every four years. This almost exactly corresponded to its displacement against the {{nowrap|'''Sothic year'''}} as well. (The Sothic year is about a minute longer than a [[solar year]].)&lt;ref name=teacosy&gt;{{harvp|Tetley|2014|p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_3_investigating_ancient_egyptian_calendars.pdf 42]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sidereal year]] of 365.25636 days is only valid for stars on the [[ecliptic]] (the apparent path of the [[Sun]] across the sky), whereas Sirius's displacement ~40˚ below the ecliptic, its [[proper motion]], and the wobbling of the [[celestial equator]] cause the period between its [[heliacal rising]]s to be almost exactly 365.25 days long instead. This steady loss of one relative day every four years over the course of the 365-day calendar meant that the "wandering" day would return to its original place relative to the solar and Sothic year after precisely 1461 civil or 1460 Julian years.

==Discovery==
This cycle was first noticed by [[Eduard Meyer]] in 1904, who then carefully combed known Egyptian inscriptions and written materials to find any mention of the calendar dates when Sirius rose at dawn. He found six of them, on which the dates of much of the [[conventional Egyptian chronology]] are based. A heliacal rise of Sirius was recorded by [[Censorinus]] as having happened on the Egyptian New Year's Day between {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}139 and 142.&lt;ref name=Kitchen&gt;Kitchen, K. A. ''The Chronology of Ancient Egypt.'' p.205. World Archaeology,  Vol. 23, No. 2 (October 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The record actually refers to 21{{nbsp}}July {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}140 but is astronomically calculated as a definite 20{{nbsp}}July {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}139. This correlates the Egyptian calendar to the Julian calendar. Leap day occurs in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}140, and so the new year on 1{{nbsp}}[[Thoth (month)|Thoth]] is 20{{nbsp}}July in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}139 but it is 19{{nbsp}}July for {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}140-142. Thus he was able to compare the day on which Sirius rose in the Egyptian calendar to the day on which Sirius ought to have risen in the Julian calendar, count the number of intercalary days needed, and determine how many years were between the beginning of a cycle and the observation. One also needs to know the place of observation, since the latitude of the observation changes the day when the heliacal rising of Sirius occurs, and mislocating an observation can potentially change the resulting chronology by several decades.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt; (Official observations were made at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] or [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] near [[Cairo]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], and [[Elephantine]] near [[Aswan]],&lt;ref name=teatime/&gt; with the rising of Sirius observed at Cairo about 8 days after it is seen at Aswan.)&lt;ref name=teatime&gt;{{citation |last=Tetley |first=M.

But research and discoveries have since shown that the [[first dynasty of Egypt]] did not begin before {{nowrap|c. [[4th millennium BC|3100 {{sc|bc}}]]}}, and the claim that 19{{nbsp}}July 4241{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} is the "earliest fixed date" has since been discredited. Most scholars either move the observation upon which he based this forward by one cycle of Sirius to 19{{nbsp}}July 2781{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} or reject the assumption that the document in question indicates a rise of Sirius at all.&lt;ref name=Grimal&gt;Grimal, Nicolas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p.52. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronological interpretation==
Three specific observations of the heliacal rise of Sirius are extremely important for Egyptian chronology. The first is the aforementioned ivory tablet from the reign of [[Djer]] which supposedly indicates the beginning of a Sothic cycle, the rising of Sirius on the same day as the new year. If this does indicate the beginning of a Sothic cycle, it must date to about 17 July 2773{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Nicolas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p.51. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this date is too late for Djer's reign, so many scholars believe that it indicates a correlation between the rising of Sirius and the Egyptian ''lunar'' calendar, instead of the solar civil calendar, which would render the tablet essentially devoid of chronological value.&lt;ref name=Grimal/&gt;
A newly discovered Sothis-date from the Old Kingdom and a subsequent astronomic study confirms the Sothic cycle model [http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/18741665-12340035 Gautschy et al. 2017 A New Astronomically Based Chronological Model for the Egyptian Old Kingdom]

The second observation is clearly a reference to a heliacal rising, and is believed to date to the seventh year of [[Senusret III]]. This observation was almost certainly made at [[Itj-Tawy]], the Twelfth Dynasty capital, which would date the Twelfth Dynasty from 1963 to 1786{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt; The Ramses or Turin Papyrus Canon says 213 years (1991-1778{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}), [[Richard Anthony Parker|Parker]] reduces it to 206 years (1991-1785{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}), based on 17{{nbsp}}July 1872{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} as the Sothic date (120th year of 12th dynasty, a drift of 30 leap days). Prior to Parker's investigation of lunar dates the 12th dynasty was placed as 213 years of 2007-1794{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} perceiving the date as 21 July 1888{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} as the 120th year, and then as 2003-1790{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} perceiving the date as 20 July 1884{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} as the 120th year.

The third observation was in the reign of [[Amenhotep I]], and, assuming it was made in Thebes, dates his reign between 1525 and 1504{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. If made in Memphis, Heliopolis, or some other Delta site instead, as a minority of scholars still argue, the entire chronology of the 18th Dynasty needs to be expanded by some 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Nicolas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p.202. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observational mechanics and precession==
The Sothic cycle is a specific example of two cycles of differing length interacting to cycle together, here called a tertiary cycle. This is mathematically defined by the formula 1/a + 1/b = 1/t or half the [[harmonic mean]]. In the case of the Sothic cycle the two cycles are the Egyptian civil year and the Sothic year. 

The Sothic year is the length of time for the star Sirius to visually return to the same position in relation to the sun. Star years measured in this way vary due to [[axial precession]],&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, M. F. "The Length of the Sothic Cycle", ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology'', '''55''' (1969), p. 36-40.&lt;/ref&gt; the movement of the Earth's axis in relation to the sun. The length of time for a star to make a yearly path can be marked when it rises to a defined altitude above a local horizon at the time of sunrise. This altitude does not have to be the altitude of first possible visibility. Throughout the year the star will rise approximately four minutes earlier each successive sunrise. Eventually the star will return to its same relative location at sunrise. This length of time can be called an observational year. Stars that reside close to the ecliptic or the ecliptic meridian will on average exhibit observational years close to the sidereal year of 365.2564 days. The ecliptic and the meridian cut the sky into four quadrants. The axis of the earth wobbles around slowly moving the observer and changing the observation of the event. If the axis swings the observer closer to the event its observational year will be shortened. Likewise, the observational year can be lengthened when the axis swings away from the observer. This depends upon which quadrant of the sky the phenomenon is observed.

The Sothic year is remarkable because its average duration was exactly 365.25 days in the early {{nowrap|4th millennium {{sc|bc}}&lt;ref&gt;SkyCharts III&lt;/ref&gt;}} before the unification of Egypt. The slow rate of change from this value is also of note. If observations and records could have been maintained during predynastic times the Sothic rise would optimally return to the same calendar day after 1461 calendar years. This value would drop to about 1456 calendar years by the Middle Kingdom. The 1461 value could also be maintained if the date of the Sothic rise were artificially maintained by moving the feast in celebration of this event one day every fourth year instead of rarely adjusting it according to observation.

It has been noticed, and the Sothic cycle confirms, that Sirius does not move retrograde across the sky like other stars, a phenomenon widely known as the [[precession of the equinox]]. Professor [[Jed Buchwald]] wrote "Sirius remains about the same distance from the equinoxes—and so from the solstices—throughout these many centuries, despite precession." &lt;ref&gt;Buchwald, Jed Z. (2003), [http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4096/1/Egyptian.pdf "Egyptian Stars under Paris Skies"], ''Engineering and Science'' (Caltech), 66 (4) (2003) 20–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the same reason, the helical rising or zenith of Sirius does not slip through the calendar at the precession rate of about one day per 71.6 years as other stars do but much slower.&lt;ref&gt;One day per 120 years, see Winlock H., ''Origin of the Ancient Egyptian Calendar'', Proc. of the Am. Philosophical Soc., '''83''' (1940): 447-64.&lt;/ref&gt; This remarkable stability within the solar year may be one reason that the Egyptians used it as a basis for their calendar. The coincidence of a heliacal rising of Sirius and the New Year reported by Censorinus occurred about the 20th of July, that is a month later after the summer solstice.

==Problems and criticisms==
Determining the date of a heliacal rise of Sirius has been shown to be difficult, especially considering the need to know the exact latitude of the observation.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt; Another problem is that because the Egyptian calendar loses one day every four years, a heliacal rise will take place on the same day for four years in a row, and any observation of that rise can date to any of those four years, making the observation imprecise.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt;

A number of criticisms have been leveled against the reliability of dating by the Sothic cycle. Some are serious enough to be considered problematic.  Firstly, none of the astronomical observations have dates that mention the specific pharaoh in whose reign they were observed, forcing Egyptologists to supply that information on the basis of a certain amount of informed speculation.  Secondly, there is no information regarding the nature of the civil calendar throughout the course of Egyptian history, forcing Egyptologists to assume that it existed unchanged for thousands of years; the Egyptians would only have needed to carry out one calendar reform in a few thousand years for these calculations to be worthless.  Other criticisms are not considered as problematic, e.g. there is no extant mention of the Sothic cycle in ancient Egyptian writing, which may simply be a result of it either being so obvious to Egyptians that it didn't merit mention or to relevant texts being destroyed over time or still awaiting discovery.

One recent popular history of the Ancient Near East by Marc Van De Mierop, in his discussion of chronology and dating, does not mention the Sothic cycle at all, and believes that the bulk of historians nowadays would consider that it is not possible to put forward exact dates earlier than the 8th century BCE. &lt;ref&gt;Marc Van De Mieroop ''A History of the Ancient Near East, ca. 3000–323 B.C.''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some have recently claimed that the [[Theran eruption]] marks the beginning of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]] due to Theran ash and pumice discoveries in the ruins of [[Avaris]] in layers that mark the end of the Hyksos era{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}. Because the evidence of [[dendrochronology|dendrochronologists]] indicates the eruption took place in 1626 BC, this has been taken to indicate that dating by the Sothic cycle is off by 50–80 years at the outset of the 18th dynasty{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}. Claims that the Thera eruption is the subject of the [[Tempest Stele]] of [[Ahmose I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ritner|first=Robert K|author2=Moeller, Nadine |title=The Ahmose ‘Tempest Stela’, Thera and Comparative Chronology|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|date=2014|volume=73|issue=1|pages=1–19|doi=10.1086/675069|jstor=10.1086/675069}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have been disputed by writers such as [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]].&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Centuries of Darkness'' (London, 1991: [http://www.centuries.co.uk/index.htm]).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen Hammerton''' ([[Floruit|fl.]] 1629&amp;ndash;47) was a [[boy player]] or child actor in [[English Renaissance theatre]], one of the young performers who specialized in female roles in the period before women appeared on the stage. His case illuminates the conditions of boy actors in this era.

{{TOC right}}

==Beginnings==
Stephen Hammerton was the son of a Richard Hammerton of Hellifield, [[Yorkshire]]. In his youth he was apprenticed to a London [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|merchant tailor]], William Waverly, of the [[Strand, London|Strand]]. At the time, veteran actors [[Richard Gunnell]] and William Blagrave, founders of the [[Salisbury Court Theatre]], were struggling to form a new company of child actors, similar to the [[Children of the Chapel]] and the [[Children of Paul's]] of thirty years before.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Thomson et al., eds., ''The Cambridge History of British Theatre,'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; Vol. 1, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Those troupes, famous in their own time, had been highly effective at training young actors and funnelling them into the adult companies that needed their talent; but the troupes of boy players had been defunct for nearly fifteen years when Blagrave and Gunnell started their Children of the Revels troupe in 1629. The relevant documents indicate clearly that part of the project's rationale was the training of young actors for the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] at the [[Blackfriars Theatre]].

Blagrave had encountered the young Hammerton and decided that the Children of the Revels needed him. Blagrave purchased the remaining nine years of Hammerton's apprenticeship contract from Waverly in October 1629. (Hammerton allegedly agreed to this change; it happened "by and with his own liking.") This was not a unique transaction; there are other instances on record in which actors and theatre managers effectively bought the services of boys for their troupes.&lt;ref&gt;Viviana Comensoli and Anne Russell, ''Enacting Gender on the English Renaissance Stage,'' Champaigne, University of Illinois Press, 1999; p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

==King's Men==
Unfortunately, the new boys' company failed to attain success, because of a long closure of the theatres due to [[bubonic plague]] at the time. According to one report, the boys were left without adequate food and clothing; fourteen boys had seven shirts among them, and one of the fourteen died of neglect. Hammerton fared better, though; sometime in 1632 he jumped to, or was recruited into, the King's Men. His transition was not without controversy; manager Blagrave was involved in a lawsuit over control of the apprentice actor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Eades Bentley|G. E. Bentley]], "The Salisbury Court Theater and Its Boy Players," ''Huntington Library Quarterly'' Vol. 40 No. 2 (February 1977), pp. 129-49.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1632, Blagrave joined with [[William Beeston]] in a petition to the [[Lord Chamberlain]] to recover custody of Hammerton. Beeston's involvement in the matter is cryptic, and the Blagrave/Beeston suit was unsuccessful;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, pp. 143-4, 148-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Hammerton remained with the King's Men and acted for them for the next ten years, till the theatres were closed in September 1642 at the start of the [[English Civil War]].

==Female to male==
Hammerton started out by playing female roles, as would be expected; in 1632 he played Oriana, the heroine in [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher's]] ''[[The Wild Goose Chase]]''. In 1633, when [[William Prynne]] published ''[[Histriomastix|Histriomastix, the Players' Scourge]]'', his famous attack on the theatre and the players, he singled out Hammerton as "a most noted and beautiful woman-actor." By the late 1630s Hammerton transitioned from female to male roles. He played in [[John Suckling (poet)|Sir John Suckling]]'s ''[[The Goblins]],'' [[James Shirley]]'s ''[[The Doubtful Heir]],'' and [[Thomas Killigrew]]'s ''[[The Parson's Wedding]].''&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew John Gurr|Andrew Gurr]], ''The Shakespeare Company 1594&amp;ndash;1642,'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Amyntor in the [[Beaumont and Fletcher]] play ''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]'' was the type of "juvenile lead" part for which he became famous. He acquired a reputation as a sort of 17th-century matinee idol, especially favored by the young women in the audience. The Epilogue to ''The Goblins'' comments on Hammerton's popularity:

::The women &amp;mdash; Oh if Stephen should be killed,
::Or miss the lady, how the plot is spilled?

Killigrew makes the same point at the end of ''The Parson's Wedding'': if "Stephen misses the Wench...that alone is enough to spoil the Play." (Hammerton's celebrity was such that he was identifiable by his first name alone &amp;mdash; much like celebrities of later centuries.)

Hammerton was made a [[Groom of the Chamber]] on 22 January 1641, along with five other King's Men. After [[London theatre closure 1642|the theatres closed in 1642]], Hammerton's fortunes, like those of the other King's Men, were eclipsed and obscured. He was one of the ten King's Men who signed the dedication to the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|first Beaumont and Fletcher folio]] in [[1647 in literature|1647]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Meyers-L2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Ethnographic map of Africa, from ''Meyers Blitz-Lexikon'' (1932).]]
Geographers historically divided the region into several distinct ethnographic sections based on each area's respective inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Raunig"&gt;{{cite book|last=Raunig|first=Walter|title=Afrikas Horn: Akten der Ersten Internationalen Littmann-Konferenz 2. bis 5.

==History==

===Prehistory===
[[File:Olduvai stone chopping tool.jpg|thumb|Stone chopping tool from [[Olduvai Gorge]]]]
According to [[paleontology]], early hominid skull anatomy was similar to that of their close cousins, the great African forest [[great ape|apes]], [[gorilla]] and [[chimpanzee]]. However, they had adopted a [[biped]]al locomotion and freed hands, giving them a crucial advantage enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open [[savanna]] at a time when Africa was drying up, with savanna encroaching on forested areas. This occurred 10 million to 5 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Shillington, Kevin 2005 p. 2"&gt;Shillington, Kevin(2005). History of Africa, Rev. 2nd Ed. New York: [[Palgrave Macmillan]], p. 2, {{ISBN|0-333-59957-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 3 million years ago several [[Australopithecus|australopithecine]] [[hominid]] species had developed throughout [[Southern Africa|southern]], [[East Africa|eastern]] and [[central Africa]]. They were tool users rather than tool manufacturers. The next major evolutionary step occurred around 2.3 million&amp;nbsp;BCE, when primitive [[lithic technology|stone tools]] were used to scavenge the carcasses of animals killed by other predators, both for their meat and their marrow. In hunting, ''H. habilis'' was most likely not capable of competing with large predators and was more prey than hunter, although ''H. habilis'' probably did steal eggs from nests and may have been able to catch small [[game (food)|game]] and weakened larger prey such as cubs and older animals. The tools were classed as [[Oldowan]].&lt;ref name="Shillington, Kevin 2005 p. 2-3"&gt;Shillington, Kevin(2005). History of Africa, Rev. 2nd Ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 2–3, {{ISBN|0-333-59957-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roughly 1.8 million years ago, ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' first appeared in the fossil record in Africa. From ''Homo ergaster'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (upright man) evolved 1.5 million years ago. Some of the earlier representatives of this species were small-brained and used primitive [[lithic technology|stone tools]], much like ''[[Homo habilis|H. habilis]]''. The brain later grew in size, and ''H. erectus'' eventually developed a more complex stone tool technology called the [[Acheulean]]. Potentially the first hominid to engage in hunting, ''H. erectus'' mastered the art of making fire. They were the first hominids to leave Africa, going on to colonize the entire [[Old World]], and perhaps later on giving rise to ''[[Homo floresiensis]]''. Although some recent writers suggest that ''[[H. georgicus]]'', a ''H. habilis'' [[lineage (anthropology)|descendant]], was the first and most primitive hominid to ever live outside Africa, many scientists consider ''H. georgicus'' to be an early and primitive member of the ''H. erectus'' species.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington, Kevin(2005). History of Africa, Rev. 2nd Ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 3, {{ISBN|0-333-59957-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fossil record shows ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' lived in southern and eastern Africa anywhere from 100,000 to 150,000 years ago. Between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago, their expansion [[Single-origin hypothesis|out of Africa]] launched the colonization of the planet by modern humans. By 10,000&amp;nbsp;BCE, ''Homo sapiens'' had spread to all corners of the world. This dispersal of the human species is suggested by linguistic, cultural and genetic evidence.&lt;ref name="Shillington, Kevin 2005 p. 2-3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The genetic studies by [[Luca Cavalli-Sforza]] are considered pioneering{{by whom|date=August 2014}} in tracing the spread of modern humans from Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Tishkoff SA, Reed FA, Friedlaender FR, etal |title=The genetic structure and history of Africans and African Americans |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5930 |pages=1035–44 | date=May 2009 |pmid=19407144 |pmc=2947357 |doi=10.1126/science.1172257|bibcode=2009Sci...324.1035T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Sahara became a desert, it did not present a totally impenetrable barrier for travelers between north and south because of the application of animal husbandry towards carrying water, food, and supplies across the desert.

(2001) ''The Encyclopedia of World History'', Houghton Mifflin Books. p. 16. {{ISBN|0-395-65237-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of oxen, mule, and horses for desert crossing was common, and trade routes followed chains of [[Oasis|oases]] that were strung across the desert. The [[trans-saharan trade]] was in full motion by 500&amp;nbsp;BCE with [[Carthage]] being a major economic force for its establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Robert O. and Burns, James. M(2007).

Trade and improved agricultural techniques supported more sophisticated societies, leading to the early civilizations of [[Sao civilization|Sao]], [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]], [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]], [[Shilluk Kingdom|Shilluk]], [[Kingdom of Baguirmi|Baguirmi]], and [[Wadai Empire|Wadai]].{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2010|p=254}}

Following the [[Bantu Migration]] into Central Africa, during the 14th century, the [[Luba Kingdom]] in southeast Congo came about under a king whose political authority derived from religious, spiritual legitimacy. The kingdom controlled agriculture and regional trade of salt and iron from the north and copper from the Zambian/Congo copper belt.&lt;ref name="History of Africa pp. 138,139,142"&gt;Shillington, Kevin(2005). History of Africa, Rev. 2nd Ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 138–39, 142, {{ISBN|0-333-59957-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rival kingship factions which split from the Luba Kingdom later moved among the Lunda people, marrying into its elite and laying the foundation of the [[Lunda Empire]] in the 16th century. The ruling dynasty centralised authority among the Lunda under the Mwata Yamyo or Mwaant Yaav. The Mwata Yamyo's legitimacy, like that of the Luba king, came from being viewed as a spiritual religious guardian. This [[imperial cult]] or system of divine kings was spread to most of central Africa by rivals in kingship migrating and forming new states. Many new states received legitimacy by claiming descent from the Lunda dynasties.&lt;ref name="History of Africa pp. 138,139,142"/&gt;

The [[Kingdom of Kongo]] existed from the Atlantic west to the Kwango river to the east. During the 15th century, the Bakongo farming community was united with its capital at [[M'banza-Kongo]], under the king title, Manikongo.&lt;ref name="History of Africa pp. 138,139,142"/&gt; Other significant states and peoples included the [[Kuba Kingdom]], producers of the famous raffia cloth, the [[Eastern Lunda]], [[Bemba people|Bemba]], [[Burundi]], [[Rwanda]], and the [[Kingdom of Ndongo]].

The [[Axumite Empire]] spanned the southern Sahara, south Arabia and the Sahel along the western shore of the [[Red Sea]]. Located in northern [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]], Aksum was deeply involved in the trade network between India and the Mediterranean. Growing from the proto-Aksumite [[Iron Age]] period circa the 4th century&amp;nbsp;BCE, it rose to prominence by the 1st century&amp;nbsp;CE. The Aksumites constructed monolithic [[Stele|stelae]] to cover the graves of their kings, such as [[King Ezana's Stele]]. The later [[Zagwe dynasty]], established in the 12th century, built churches out of solid rock. These rock-hewn structures include the [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela|Church of St. George at Lalibela]].

Settlements of [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples, who were [[iron]]-using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the [[Limpopo River]] by the 4th or 5th century displacing and absorbing the original [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] speakers. They slowly moved south, and the earliest ironworks in modern-day [[KwaZulu-Natal|KwaZulu-Natal Province]] are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the [[Xhosa people]], whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoisan inhabitants. They reached the [[Great Fish River|Fish River]] in today's [[Eastern Cape|Eastern Cape Province]].

[[Monomotapa]] was a medieval kingdom (c. 1250–1629), which existed between the [[Zambezi]] and [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] rivers of [[Southern Africa]] in the territory of modern-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Mozambique]]. Its old capital was located at [[Great Zimbabwe]].

In 1487, [[Bartolomeu Dias]] became the first European to reach the southernmost tip of Africa. In 1652, a [[Victualler|victualling station]] was established at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] by [[Jan van Riebeeck]] on behalf of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. For most of the 17th and 18th centuries, the slowly expanding settlement was a [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] possession.

[[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] seized the Cape of Good Hope area in 1795, ostensibly to prevent it from falling into the hands of the French but also to use [[Cape Town]] in particular as a stop on the route to [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|Australia]] and [[Company rule in India|India]]. It was later returned to the Dutch in 1803, but soon afterwards the Dutch East India Company declared bankruptcy, and the British annexed the [[Cape Colony]] in 1806.

The [[Zulu Kingdom]] was a Southern African tribal state in what is now [[KwaZulu-Natal]] in southeastern South Africa. The small kingdom gained world fame during and after the [[Anglo-Zulu War]].

During the 1950s and early 1960s, most Sub-Saharan African nations achieved independence from colonial rule.&lt;ref&gt;M. Martin, Phyllis and O'Meara, Patrick (1995). Africa 3rd edition, Bloomington and Indianapolis: [[Indiana University Press]], p. 156, {{ISBN|0-253-32916-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1960s, the Southeast African nations achieved independence from colonial rule.

[[Nubia]] in present-day Northern [[Sudan]] and southernmost of [[Egypt]], was referred to as "[[Aethiopia]]" ("land of the burnt face") by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Thompson |first= Lloyd A. |title= Romans and blacks |url= https://books.google.com/?id=7MQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Sub-Saharan+Africa%22+Ethiopia+Aethiopia&amp;q= |page= 57 |year= 1989 |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn= 0-415-03185-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nubia]] at her greatest phase is considered Sub-Saharan Africa's oldest urban civilisation. Nubia was a major source of gold for the ancient world. Nubians built famous structures and numerous pyramids. Sudan, the site of ancient Nubia, has more pyramids than anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Mokhtar (editor), AnciGent Civilizations of Africa Vo.

The [[Bantu expansion]] is a major migration movement originating in West Africa around 2500&amp;nbsp;BCE, reaching East and Central Africa by 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE and Southern Africa by the early centuries&amp;nbsp;CE.

The [[Djenné-Djenno]] city-state flourished from 250 BCE to 900 CE and was influential to the development of the [[Ghana Empire]].

The [[Nok culture]] is known from a type of [[terracotta]] figure found in Nigeria, dating to between 500&amp;nbsp;BCE and 200&amp;nbsp;CE.

There were a number of medieval empires of the southern Sahara and the Sahel, based on [[trans-Saharan trade]], including the [[Ghana Empire]] and the [[Mali Empire]], [[Songhai Empire]], the [[Kanem Empire]] and the subsequent [[Bornu Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Basil. Africa History, Themes and Outlines, revised and expanded edition. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, pp. 87–107, {{ISBN|0-684-82667-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They built stone structures like in [[Tichit]], but mainly constructed in [[adobe]]. The [[Great Mosque of Djenne]] is most reflective of Sahelian architecture and is the largest adobe building in the world.

In the forest zone, several states and empires emerged. The [[Ashanti Empire]] arose in the 16th century in modern-day Ghana and Ivory Coast. The [[Kingdom of Nri]], was established by the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] in the 11th century. Nri was famous for having a priest-king who wielded no military power. Nri was a rare African state which was a haven for freed slaves and outcasts who sought refuge in their territory. Other major states included the kingdoms of [[Ife|Ifẹ]] and [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] in the western block of Nigeria which became prominent about 700–900 and 1400 respectively, and center of [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] culture. The Yoruba's built massive mud walls around their cities, the most famous being [[Sungbo's Eredo]]. Another prominent kingdom in southwestern Nigeria was the [[Kingdom of Benin]] 9th–11th century whose power lasted between the 15th and 19th century and was one of the greatest Empires of African history documented all over the world. Their dominance reached as far as the well-known city of Eko which was named [[Lagos]] by the Portuguese traders and other early European settlers. The [[Kingdom of Benin|Edo]] speaking people of Benin are known for their famous bronze casting and rich coral, wealth, ancient science and technology and the [[Walls of Benin]], which is the largest man-made structure in the world.

In the 18th century, the Oyo and the [[Aro confederacy]] were responsible for most of the slaves exported from Nigeria, with Great Britain, France and Portugal shipping the majority of the slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/nigeria/7.htm |title=The Slave Trade |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the British expanded trade with the Nigerian interior. In 1885, British claims to a West African sphere of influence received international recognition, and in the following year the [[Royal Niger Company]] was chartered under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. In 1900, the company's territory came under the control of the British Government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British protectorate, part of the [[British Empire]], the foremost world power at the time.

By 1960, most of the region achieved independence from colonial rule.

==== Afroasiatic ====
With the exception of the extinct [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] (a [[language isolate]]) of [[Mesopotamia]], Afro-Asiatic has the oldest documented history of any language family in the world. Egyptian was recorded as early as 3200&amp;nbsp;BCE. The [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch was recorded as early as 2900&amp;nbsp;BCE in the form of the [[Akkadian language]] of [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]]) and circa 2500&amp;nbsp;BCE in the form of the [[Eblaite language]] of north eastern [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Keith and Ogilvie, Sarah(2008). Concise encyclopedia of languages of the world ''Concise Encyclopedias of Language and Linguistics Series''. Elsevier, p. 12, {{ISBN|978-0-08-087774-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of the [[Afroasiatic languages]] within Africa is principally concentrated in North Africa and the Horn of Africa. Languages belonging to the family's [[Berber languages|Berber]] branch are mainly spoken in the north, with its speech area extending into the Sahel (northern Mauritania, northern Mali, northern Niger).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcp.ma/Recensement-general-de-la-population-et-de-l-habitat-2004_a633.html|title=Recensement général de la population et de l'habitat 2004|first=Youssef|last=Maaroufi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;African Languages at Michigan State University (ASC) | Michigan State University".

==== Khoisan ====
The several families lumped under the term [[Khoi-San]] include languages indigenous to [[Southern Africa]] and [[Tanzania]], though some, such as the [[Khoi languages]], appear to have moved to their current locations not long before the [[Bantu expansion]].&lt;ref name=GE&gt;Güldemann, Tom and Edward D. Elderkin (forthcoming) [http://email.eva.mpg.de/~gueldema/pdf/Gueldemann_Elderkin.pdf "On external genealogical relationships of the Khoe family".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325021922/http://email.eva.mpg.de/~gueldema/pdf/Gueldemann_Elderkin.pdf |date=25 March 2009 }} In Brenzinger, Matthias and Christa König (eds.), ''Khoisan languages and linguistics: the Riezlern symposium 2003.'' Quellen zur Khoisan-Forschung 17. Köln: Rüdiger Köppe.&lt;/ref&gt; In Southern Africa, their speakers are the [[Khoikhoi]] and [[San people|San]] (Bushmen), in Southeast Africa, the [[Sandawe people|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza people|Hadza]].

==== Niger–Congo ====
The [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] family is the largest in the world in terms of the number of languages (1,436) it contains.&lt;ref&gt;Bellwood, Peter S.(2005). First farmers: the origins of agricultural societies. Wiley-Blackwell, p. 218, {{ISBN|978-0-631-20566-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of languages of this family are [[tonal language|tonal]] such as [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], and [[Igbo language|Igbo]], However, others such as [[Fulani language|Fulani]] and [[Wolof language|Wolof]] are not. A major branch of the Niger–Congo languages is [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], which covers a greater geographic area than the rest of the family. Bantu speakers represent the majority of inhabitants in southern, central and southeastern Africa, though [[San people|San]], [[Pygmy]], and [[Nilotic]] groups, respectively, can also be found in those regions. Bantu-speakers can also be found in parts of [[Central Africa]] such as the [[Gabon]], [[Equatorial Guinea]] and southern [[Cameroon]]. [[Swahili language|Swahili]], a Bantu language with many [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Farsi|Persian]] and other Middle Eastern and South Asian [[loan word]]s, developed as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' for trade between the different peoples in southeastern Africa. In the [[Kalahari Desert]] of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as Bushmen (also "San", closely related to, but distinct from "[[Khoikhoi|Hottentots]]") have long been present. The San evince unique physical traits, and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of Central Africa.

==== Nilo-Saharan ====
The [[Nilo-Saharan languages]] are concentrated in the upper parts of the [[Chari River|Chari]] and [[Nile]] rivers of Central Africa and Southeast Africa. They are principally spoken by [[Nilotic]] peoples and are also spoken in Sudan among the [[Fur]], [[Masalit people|Masalit]], [[Nubian people|Nubian]] and [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] peoples and in West and Central Africa among the [[Songhai people|Songhai]], [[Zarma people|Zarma]] and [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]]. The [[Old Nubian language]] is also a member of this family.

===Genetic history{{anchor|Archaeogenetics}}===
{{see|Early human migrations|Y-DNA haplogroups in populations of Sub-Saharan Africa|Macro-haplogroup L (mtDNA)|Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|Haplogroup N (mtDNA)}}
A 2017 archaeogenetic study of prehistoric fossils in Sub-Saharan Africa observed a wide-ranging early presence of Khoisan populations in the region. [[Khoisan]]-related ancestry was inferred to have contributed to two thirds of the ancestry of hunter-gatherer populations inhabiting [[Malawi]] between 8,100 and 2,500 years ago and to one third of the ancestry of hunter gatherers inhabiting [[Tanzania]] as late as 1,400 years ago. Also in Tanzania, a pastoralist individual was found to carry ancestry related to the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic|pre-pottery]] [[Levant]]. These diverse early ancestries are believed to have been largely replaced after the [[Bantu expansion]] into central, eastern and southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2017.08.049| pmid=28938123| pmc=5679310|title = Reconstructing Prehistoric African Population Structure| journal=Cell| volume=171| issue=1| pages=59–71.e21|year = 2017|last1 = Skoglund|first1 = Pontus| last2=Thompson| first2=Jessica C.| last3=Prendergast| first3=Mary E.| last4=Mittnik| first4=Alissa| last5=Sirak| first5=Kendra| last6=Hajdinjak| first6=Mateja| last7=Salie| first7=Tasneem| last8=Rohland| first8=Nadin| last9=Mallick| first9=Swapan| last10=Peltzer| first10=Alexander| last11=Heinze| first11=Anja| last12=Olalde| first12=Iñigo| last13=Ferry| first13=Matthew| last14=Harney| first14=Eadaoin| last15=Michel| first15=Megan| last16=Stewardson| first16=Kristin| last17=Cerezo-Román| first17=Jessica I.| last18=Chiumia| first18=Chrissy| last19=Crowther| first19=Alison| last20=Gomani-Chindebvu| first20=Elizabeth| last21=Gidna| first21=Agness O.| last22=Grillo| first22=Katherine M.| last23=Helenius| first23=I.

A 2009 [[human genetic clustering|genetic clustering]] study, which genotyped 1327 polymorphic markers in various African populations, identified six ancestral clusters through Bayesian analysis and fourteen ancestral clusters through STRUCTURE analysis within the continent. The clustering corresponded closely with ethnicity, culture and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tishkoff |first1=SA |year=2009 |title=The Genetic Structure and History of Africans and African Americans |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=324 |issue=5930 |pages=1037–39 | url=http://faculty.washington.edu/wjs18/Pop_Structure/TishkoffAfrican.pdf |bibcode=2009Sci...324.1035T |doi=10.1126/science.1172257 |pmc=2947357 |pmid=19407144|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[whole genome sequencing]] analysis of modern populations inhabiting Sub-Saharan Africa has observed several primary inferred ancestry components: a [[African Pygmies|Pygmy]]-related component carried by the [[Mbuti people|Mbuti]] and [[Aka people|Biaka]] Pygmies in Central Africa, a Khoisan-related component carried by [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]]-speaking populations in Southern Africa, a Niger-Congo-related component carried by [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]]-speaking populations throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, a Nilo-Saharan-related component carried by [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]-speaking populations in the Nile Valley and African Great Lakes, and a West Eurasian-related component carried by [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa and Nile Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jason A.

{{As of|2009}}, fifty percent of Africa is rural with no access to electricity. Africa generates 47 GW of electricity, less than 0.6% of the global market share. Many countries are affected by power shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Creamer Media Reporter|title=Africa’s energy problems threatens growth, says Nepad CEO|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/africas-energy-problems-threatens-growth-says-nepad-ceo-2009-11-12|website=www.engineeringnews.co.za|publisher=Engineering News|accessdate=14 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604035047/http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/africas-energy-problems-threatens-growth-says-nepad-ceo-2009-11-12|archivedate=4 June 2013|date=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of rising prices in commodities such as coal and oil, thermal sources of energy are proving to be too expensive for power generation. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to build additional [[hydropower]] generation capacity of at least 20,165 MW by 2014. The region has the potential to generate 1,750 TWh of energy, of which only 7% has been explored. The failure to exploit its full energy potential is largely due to significant underinvestment, as at least four times as much (approximately $23 billion a year) &lt;!--something missing here, such as "could be generated"?--&gt;and what is currently spent is invested in operating high cost power systems and not on expanding the infrastructure.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

African governments are taking advantage of the readily available water resources to broaden their energy mix. Hydro Turbine Markets in Sub-Saharan Africa generated revenues of $120.0 million in 2007 and is estimated to reach $425.0 million.{{when|date=February 2013}} Asian countries, notably China, India, and Japan, are playing an active role in power projects across the African continent. The majority of these power projects are hydro-based because of China's vast experience in the construction of hydro-power projects and part of the Energy &amp; Power Growth Partnership Services programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us-cdn.creamermedia.co.za/assets/articles/attachments/19642_frost.pdf |title=Creamer Media|format=PDF|publisher=Us-cdn.creamermedia.co.za |accessdate=2015-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD) is developing an integrated, continent-wide energy strategy. This has been funded by, amongst others, the [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB) and the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund. These projects must be sustainable, involve a cross-border dimension and/or have a regional impact, involve public and private capital, contribute to poverty alleviation and economic development, involve at least one country in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

According to researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]], the lack of infrastructure in many [[developing countries]] represents one of the most significant limitations to [[economic growth]] and achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs).&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Christian K.M.

Spending on roads averages just below 2% of GDP with varying degree among countries. This compares with 1% of GDP that is typical in industrialised countries, and 2–3% of GDP found in fast-growing emerging economies. Although the level of effort is high relative to the size of Africa's economies, it remains little in absolute terms, with low-income countries spending an average of about US$7 per capita per year.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Gwilliam, Vivien Foster, Rodrigo Archondo-Callao, Cecilia Briceño-Garmendia, Alberto Nogales, and Kavita Sethi(2008).

Infrastructure investments contributed to Africa's growth, and increased investment is necessary to maintain growth and tackle poverty.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Monthly-Review-51-03-Saul-Leys/&gt;&lt;ref name=Monthly-Review-Magdoff-65-06/&gt; The returns to investment in infrastructure are very significant, with on average 30–40% returns for [[telecommunications]] (ICT) investments, over 40% for [[electricity]] generation and 80% for roads.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

In Africa, it is argued that in order to meet the MDGs by 2015 infrastructure investments would need to reach about 15% of GDP (around $93 billion a year).&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Currently, the source of financing varies significantly across sectors.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Some sectors are dominated by state spending, others by overseas [[development aid]] (ODA) and yet others by private investors.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; In Sub-Saharan Africa, the state spends around $9.4 billion out of a total of $24.9 billion.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; In [[irrigation]], SSA states represent almost all spending; in transport and energy a majority of investment is state spending; in [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] and [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]], the private sector represents the majority of capital expenditure.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Overall, aid, the private sector and non-OECD financiers between them exceed state spending.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; The private sector spending alone equals state capital expenditure, though the majority is focused on ICT infrastructure investments.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; External financing increased from $7 billion (2002) to $27 billion (2009).

By 2015, it is estimated that 25% of North American oil will be from Sub-Saharan Africa, ahead of the Middle East.
Sub-Saharan Africa has been the focus of an intense race for oil by the West, China, India, and other emerging economies, even though it holds only 10% of proven oil reserves, less than the Middle East. This race has been referred to as the second Scramble for Africa. All reasons for this global scramble come from the reserves' economic benefits. Transportation cost is low and no pipelines have to be laid as in Central Asia. Almost all reserves are offshore, so political turmoil within the host country will not directly interfere with operations. Sub-Saharan oil is viscous, with a very low sulfur content. This quickens the refining process and effectively reduces costs. New sources of oil are being located in Sub-Saharan Africa more frequently than anywhere else. Of all new sources of oil, ⅓ are in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Ghazvinian, John (2008). Untapped: The Scramble for Africa's Oil.

Sub-Saharan Africa has more variety of grains than anywhere in the world. Between 13,000 and 11,000&amp;nbsp;BCE wild grains began to be collected as a source of food in the cataract region of the Nile, south of Egypt. The collecting of wild grains as source of food spread to Syria, parts of Turkey, and Iran by the eleventh millennium&amp;nbsp;BCE. By the tenth and ninth millennia southwest Asians domesticated their wild grains, wheat, and barley after the notion of collecting wild grains spread from the Nile.&lt;ref name="The Civilization of Africa"&gt;[[Christopher Ehret]], (2002).

=== Major progress in access to education ===
[[File:University of Antananarivo Madagascar.JPG|thumb|The [[University of Antananarivo]] in [[Antananarivo]], [[Madagascar]] ]]
At the World Conference held in [[Jomtien Beach|Jomtien]], [[Thailand]] in 1990, delegates from 155 countries and representatives of some 150 organizations gathered with the goal to promote [[Universal Primary Education|universal primary education]] and the radical reduction of illiteracy before the end of the decade. The [[World Education Forum]], held ten years later in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], provided the opportunity to reiterate and reinforce these goals. This initiative contributed to having education made a priority of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] in 2000, with the aim of achieving universal schooling (MDG2) and eliminating gender disparities, especially in primary and secondary education (MDG3).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Agence Française de Développement, Agence universitaire de la Francophonie, Orange, &amp; UNESCO. (2015). Digital Services for Education in Africa. ''Savoirs communs, 17.'' http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since the World Education Forum in Dakar, considerable efforts have been made to respond to these demographic challenges in terms of education. The amount of funds raised has been decisive. Between 1999 and 2010, public spending on education as a percentage of [[Gross national product|gross national product (GNP)]] increased by 5% per year in sub-Saharan Africa, with major variations between countries, with percentages varying from 1.8% in Cameroon to over 6% in Burundi.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;UNESCO. (2012). ''Education for All Global Monitoring Report 2012 – Youth and Skills: Putting Education to Work.'' Luxembourg: UNESCO Publications. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002180/218003e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, governments in sub-Saharan Africa spend on average 18% of their total budget on education, against 15% in the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the years immediately after the Dakar Forum, the efforts made by African States towards achieving [[Education For All|EFA]] produced multiple results in sub-Saharan Africa. The greatest advance was in access to primary education, which governments had made their absolute priority. The number of children in primary school in sub-Saharan Africa thus rose from 82 million in 1999 to 136.4 million in 2011. In Niger for example, the number of children entering school increased more than three and a half times between 1999 and 2011.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In Ethiopia, over the same period, over 8.5 million more children were admitted to primary school. The net rate of first year access in sub-Saharan Africa has thus risen by 19 points in 12 years, from 58% in 1999 to 77% in 2011. Despite the considerable efforts, the latest available data from the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]] estimates that, for 2012, there were still 57.8 million children who were not in school. Of these, 29.6 million were in sub-Saharan Africa alone, a figure which has not changed for several years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many sub-Saharan countries have notably included the first year of secondary school in basic education. In Rwanda, the first year of secondary school was attached to primary education in 2009, which significantly increased the number of pupils enrolled at this level of education.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; In 2012 the primary completion rate (PCR) – which measures the proportion of children reaching the final year of primary school – was 70%, meaning that more than three out of ten children entering primary school do not reach the final primary year.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

Traditional African religions can be broken down into linguistic cultural groups, with common themes. Among [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]]-speakers is a belief in a creator God; ancestor spirits; territorial spirits; evil caused by human ill will and neglecting ancestor spirits; priest of territorial spirits. New world religions such as [[Santería]], [[West African Vodun|Vodun]], and [[Candomblé]], would be derived from this world view. Among [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] speakers is the belief in Divinity; evil is caused by divine judgement and retribution; prophets as middlemen between Divinity and man. Among [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]]-speakers is [[henotheism]], the belief in one's own gods but accepting the existence of other gods; evil here is caused by malevolent spirits.

Traditional religions in Sub-Saharan Africa often display complex ontology, cosmology and metaphysics. Mythologies, for example, demonstrated the difficulty fathers of creation had in bringing about order from chaos. Order is what is right and natural and any deviation is chaos.

Sub-Saharan traditional divination systems display great sophistication. For example, the bamana sand divination uses well established symbolic codes that can be reproduced using four bits or marks. A binary system of one or two marks are combined. Random outcomes are generated using a [[fractal]] recursive process. It is analogous to a digital circuit but can be reproduced on any surface with one or two marks. This system is widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Eglash, Ron: "African Fractals: Modern computing and indigenous design."

==Culture==
Sub-Saharan Africa is diverse, with many communities, villages and cities, each with their own beliefs and traditions. Traditional African Societies are communal, they believe that the needs of the many far out weigh an individual needs and achievements. Basically, an individual's keep must be shared with other extended family members. Extended families are made up of various individuals and families who have shared responsibilities within the community. This extended family is one of the core aspects of every African community. “An African will refer to an older person as auntie or uncle. Siblings of parents will be called father or mother rather than uncle and aunt. Cousins will be called brother or sister”. This system can be very difficult for outsiders to understand; however, it is no less important. “Also reflecting their communal ethic, Africans are reluctant to stand out in a crowd or to appear different from their neighbors or colleagues, a result of social pressure to avoid offense to group standards and traditions." Women also have a very important role in African culture because they take care of the house and children. Traditionally “men do the heavy work of clearing and plowing the land, women sow the seeds, tend the fields, harvest the crops, haul the water, and bear the major burden for growing the family’s food”. Despite their work in the fields women are expected to be subservient to men in some African cultures. “When young women migrate to cities, this imbalance between the sexes, as well as financial need, often causes young women of lower economic status, who lack education and job training, to have sexual relationships with older men who are established in their work or profession and can afford to support a girlfriend or two”.&lt;ref name="Intercultural Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richmond|first1=Yale|last2=Gestrin|first2=Phyllis|title=Into Africa: a guide to Sub-Saharan culture and diversity|date=2009|publisher=Intercultural Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-931930-91-8|url=http://site.ebrary.com/id/10430707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{Further|Music of Africa|African popular music}}
[[File:TrebleKalimba.jpg|thumb|A traditional polyrhythmic [[kalimba]] ]]

Traditional Sub-Saharan African music is as diverse as the region's various populations. The common perception of Sub-Saharan African music is that it is rhythmic music centered around the drums. It is partially true. A large part of Sub-Saharan music, mainly among speakers of [[Niger–Congo]] and [[Nilo-Saharan]] languages, is rhythmic and centered around the drum. Sub-Saharan music is polyrhythmic, usually consisting of multiple rhythms in one composition. Dance involves moving multiple body parts. These aspect of Sub-Saharan music has been transferred to the new world by enslaved Sub-Saharan Africans and can be seen in its influence on music forms as [[Samba]], [[Jazz]], [[Rhythm and Blues]], [[Rock &amp; Roll]], [[Salsa music|Salsa]], [[Reggae]] and [[Rap]] music.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Bowden, Rob(2007). Africa South of the Sahara. Coughlan Publishing: p. 40, {{ISBN|1-4034-9910-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

But Sub-Saharan music involves a lot of music with strings, horns, and very little poly-rhythms. Music from the eastern sahel and along the nile, among the [[Nilo-Saharan]], made extensive use of strings and horns in ancient times. Among the [[Afro-Asiatic]]s, we see extensive use of string instruments. Dancing involve swaying body movements and footwork. Among the [[San people|San]] is extensive use of string instruments with emphasis on footwork.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Ehret]], (2002). The Civilizations of Africa. Charlottesville: University of Virginia, p. 103, {{ISBN|0-8139-2085-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Sub-Saharan African music has been influence by music from the New World (Jazz, Salsa, Rhythm and Blues etc.) vice versa being influenced by enslaved Sub-Saharan Africans. Popular styles are [[Mbalax]] in [[Senegal]] and [[Gambia]], [[Highlife]] in [[Ghana]], [[Zoblazo]] in [[Ivory Coast]], [[Makossa]] in [[Cameroon]], [[Soukous]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Kizomba]] in [[Angola]], and [[Mbaqanga]] in [[South Africa]]. New World styles like Salsa, R&amp;B/Rap, Reggae, and Zouk also have widespread popularity.

Although Sub-Saharan African art is very diverse there are some common themes. One is the use of the human figure. Second, there is a preference for [[sculpture]]. Sub-Saharan African art is meant to be experienced in three dimensions, not two. A house is meant to be experienced from all angles. Third, art is meant to be performed. Sub-Saharan Africans have specific name for masks. The name incorporates the sculpture, the dance, and the spirit that incorporates the mask. The name denotes all three elements. Fourth, art that serves a practical function, utilitarian. The artist and craftsman are not separate. A sculpture shaped like a hand can be used as a stool. Fifth, the use of [[fractals]] or non-linear scaling. The shape of the whole is the shape of the parts at different scales. Before the discovery of fractal geometry], Leopold Sedar Senghor, Senegal's first president, referred to this as "dynamic symmetry." [[William Buller Fagg|William Fagg]], the British art historian, compared it to the logarithmic mapping of natural growth by biologist D’Arcy Thompson. Lastly, Sub-Saharan African art is visually abstract, instead of naturalistic. Sub-Saharan African art represents spiritual notions, social norms, ideas, values, etc. An artist might exaggerated the head of a sculpture in relations to the body not because he does not know anatomy but because he wants to illustrate that the head is the seat of knowledge and wisdom. The visual abstraction of African art was very influential in the works of [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/aima/hd_aima.htm modernist] artist like Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Jacques Lipchitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/aima/hd_aima.htm |title=African Influences in Modern Art &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre, Marc(1998).

==Cuisine==
{{Further|African cuisine}}
[[File:Fufu.jpg|thumb|A plate of [[fufu]] accompanied with [[peanut soup]]]]

Sub-Saharan African cuisine like everything about Africa is very diverse. A lot of regional overlapping occurs, but there are dominant elements region by region.

West African cuisine can be described as starchy, flavorfully spicey. Dishes include [[fufu]], [[kenkey]], [[couscous]], [[garri]], foutou, and banku. Ingredients are of native starchy tubers, [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[Eddoe|cocoyams]], and [[cassava]]. Grains include millet, sorghum, and rice, usually in the sahel, are incorporated. Oils include palm oil and shea butter(sahel). One finds recipes that mixes fish and meat. Beverages are palm wine(sweet or sour) and millet beer. Roasting, baking, boiling, frying, mashing, and spicing are all cooking techniques.
[[File:Ugali and cabbage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ugali]] and [[cabbage]]]]
Southeast African cuisine especially those of the [[Swahili people|Swahilis]] reflects its Islamic, geographical Indian Ocean cultural links. Dishes include [[ugali]], sukuma wiki, and halva. Spices such as curry, saffron, cloves, cinnamon, pomegranate juice, cardamon, ghee, and sage are used, especially among Muslims. Meat includes cattle, sheep, and goats, but is rarely eaten since its viewed as currency and wealth.

In the [[Horn of Africa]], pork and non-fish seafood is avoided by Christians and Muslims. Dairy products and all meats are avoided during lent by Ethiopians. Maize (corn) is a major staple. Cornmeal is used to make [[ugali]], a popular dish with different names. [[Teff]] is used to make [[injera]] or canjeero (Somali) bread. Other important foods include [[enset]], [[noog]], lentils, rice, banana, leafy greens, chiles, peppers, coconut milk and tomatoes. Beverages are coffee (domesticated in Ethiopia), chai tea, fermented beer from banana or millet. Cooking techniques include roasting and marinating.

[[File:Alicha 1.jpg|thumb|This meal, consisting of ''injera'' and several kinds of ''wat'' (stew), is typical of [[Ethiopia]]n and [[Eritrea]]n cuisine.]]
Central African cuisine connects with all major regions of Sub-Saharan Africa: Its cuisine reflects that. Ugali and fufu are eaten in the region. Central African cuisine is very starchy and spicy hot. Dominant crops include plantains, cassava, peanuts, chillis, and okra. Meats include beef, chicken, and sometimes exotic meats called bush meat (antelope, warthog, crocodile). Widespread spicy hot fish cuisine is one of the differentiating aspects. Mushroom is sometimes used as a meat substitute.

Traditional Southern African cuisine surrounds meat. Traditional society typically focused on raising, sheep, goats, and especially cattle. Dishes include braai (barbecue meat), sadza, bogobe, [[pap (food)|pap]] (fermented cornmeal), milk products (buttermilk, yoghurt). Crops utilised are sorghum, maize (corn), pumpkin beans, leafy greens, and cabbage. Beverages include ting (fermented sorghum or maize), milk, chibuku (milky beer). Influences from the Indian and Malay community can be seen its use of curries, sambals, pickled fish, fish stews, chutney, and samosa. European influences can be seen in cuisines like [[biltong]] (dried beef strips), potjies (stews of maize, onions, tomatoes), French wines, and crueler or koeksister (sugar syrup cookie).

Like most of the world, Sub-Saharan Africans have adopted Western-style clothing. In some country like Zambia, used Western clothing has flooded markets, causing great angst in the retail community. Sub-Saharan Africa boasts its own traditional [http://www.hamillgallery.com/SITE/Textiles.html clothing style]. Cotton seems to be the dominant material.

In East Africa, one finds extensive use of cotton clothing. Shemma, shama, and kuta are types of Ethiopian clothing. [[Kanga (African garment)|Kanga]] are [[Swahili culture|Swahili]] cloth that comes in rectangular shapes, made of pure cotton, and put together to make clothing. Kitenges are similar to kangas and kikoy, but are of a thicker cloth, and have an edging only on a long side. [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], and [[South Sudan]] are some of the African countries where kitenge is worn. In [[Malawi]], [[Namibia]] and [[Zambia]], kitenge is known as Chitenge. One of the unique materials, which is not a fiber and is used to make clothing is barkcloth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?cp=UG&amp;topic=mp|title=Intangible Heritage Home –- intangible heritage – Culture Sector |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; an innovation of the Baganda people of Uganda.

In West Africa, again cotton is the material of choice. In the Sahel and other parts of West Africa the [[boubou (clothing)|boubou]] and [[kaftan]] style of clothing are featured. [[Kente cloth]] is created by the [[Akan people]] of Ghana and Ivory Coast, from silk of the various moth species in West Africa. Kente comes from the [[Ashanti language|Ashanti]] [[twi]] word ''kenten'' which means basket. It is sometimes used to make [[dashiki]] and [[kufi]].

In Central Africa, the Kuba people developed raffia cloth&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"/&gt; from the raffia plant fibers. It was widely used in the region. Barkcloth was also extensively used.

In Southern Africa one finds numerous uses of animal hide and skins for clothing. The Ndau in central Mozambique and the Shona mix hide with barkcloth and cotton cloth. Cotton cloth is referred to as machira. Xhosa, Tswana, Sotho, and Swazi also made extensive use of hides. Hides come from cattle, sheep, goat, and elephant. Leopard skins were coveted and were a symbol of kingship in Zulu society. Skins were tanned to form leather, dyed, and embedded with beads.

Cricket has a following. The [[African Cricket Association]] is an international body which oversees cricket in African countries. South Africa and Zimbabwe have their own governing bodies. In 2003 the [[Cricket World Cup]] was held in South Africa, first time it was held in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Over the years, [[Ethiopia]] and [[Kenya]] have produced many notable long-distance athletes. Each country has federations that identify and cultivate top talent.

Tuvale is the author of ''An account of Samoan History up to 1918'',&lt;ref name=nzetc2&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-TuvAcco-t1-front1-d3.html] New Zealand Electronic Text Centre. Retrieved 16 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; a key historical text in [[History of Samoa|Samoan history]] which includes first hand accounts of the rivalry between European colonial powers and Samoan chiefly families.&lt;ref name=bk1/&gt; He was also an official translator and spoke [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and some [[Fijian language|Fijian]].&lt;ref name=bk1/&gt;

==Background==
Tuvale was born in [[Faleasiu]] village on the north coast of [[Upolu]] island. His father was Vaaelua Petaia (1822–1881), one of the first Samoan [[Christian]] converts to the [[London Missionary Society]] and the first pastor of Faleasiu. Following in his father's footsteps, Tuvale attended the seminary at [[Malua]] village in 1875. The Malua Theological College had been established in 1844. He taught at the Malua training school in 1877. An older brother with the family's ''matai'' chief title of Le Mamea was a Samoan official in the government and helped him to get work in the administration. In 1878, he was appointed assistant secretary to the official indigenous Samoa government based at the village of [[Mulinu'u]]. He held successive positions through different colonial regimes. He spent some years in [[Fiji]] where he became friends with Fiji's paramount chief Ratu Cakobau. In 1900, he led a group of traditional dancers to [[Germany]] where he met the [[Kaiser]]. He was a translator for [[Wilhelm Solf]], the German governor in Samoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Historian==
Tuvale's historical works included detailed recordings of [[Architecture of Samoa|Samoan architecture]], genealogies (''gafa''), [[fa'a Samoa]], culture, language and ceremonies.&lt;ref name=nzetc/&gt;

Tuvale writes in the introduction of ''An Account of Samoan History up to 1918'';

{{cquote|''Although the stories and opinions from different districts differ and lack a single origin, yet they have been recorded. The recording has not been done under the eye of a critic for Samoan stories in the days of darkness were treasured in the heart and not written''.

''I, Teo Tuvale, have tried to gather these stories over many years for my own use and interest. Colonel Robert Logan intimated to me that he wished me to put on record the story of happenings in Samoa from ancient times to the present day in order that they should be issued in printed form, and I attempt to obey his wish with this object in view''.&lt;ref name=nzetc/&gt;}}

Tuvale also helped two brothers compile another important historical document ''Tusi Fa'alupega'' (Samoan ceremonial greetings in oratory) which was given to the London Missionary Society.&lt;ref name=bk1/&gt;

==Death==
Tuvale's last job was supervising the burial of the dead during the [[1918 flu epidemic]] which killed an estimated 22% (8,500) of Samoa's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Thucydides''' ({{IPAc-en|θj|uː|ˈ|s|ɪ|d|ɪ|d|iː|z}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Θουκυδίδης}} ''{{transl|grc|Thoukydídēs}}'' {{IPA-el|tʰuːkydídɛːs|}}; {{circa| 460| 400}} BC) was an [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[historian]] and [[general officer|general]]. His ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' recounts [[Peloponnesian War|the fifth-century BC war]] between [[Sparta]] and [[Athens]] until the year 411 BC. Thucydides has been dubbed the father of "[[scientific history]]" by those who accept his claims to have applied strict standards of  impartiality and evidence-gathering and analysis of cause and effect, without reference to intervention by the deities, as outlined in his introduction to his work.&lt;ref name=Cochrane&gt;{{cite book |last=Cochrane |first=Charles Norris |author-link=Charles Norris Cochrane |title=Thucydides and the Science of History |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1929 |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, p. 67; de Sainte Croix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Korab-Karpowicz|first= W. Julian|title=Political Realism in International Relations|work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Summer 2013 |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/realism-intl-relations/|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also has been called the father of the school of [[political realism]], which views the political behavior of individuals and the subsequent outcomes of relations between states as ultimately mediated by and constructed upon the emotions of [[fear]] and [[self-interest]].&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; His text is still studied at universities and military colleges worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Harloe, Katherine, Morley, Neville, ''Thucydides and the Modern World: Reception, Reinterpretation and Influence from the Renaissance to the Present''. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press (2012). p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Melian dialogue]] is regarded as a seminal work of [[international relations theory]], while his version of [[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] is widely studied by political theorists, historians, and students of the [[classical studies|classics]].

More generally, Thucydides developed an understanding of human nature to explain behaviour in such crises as [[Plague (disease)|plagues]], [[List of events named massacres|massacres]], and [[civil war]].

== Life ==

In spite of his stature as a historian, modern historians know relatively little about Thucydides's life. The most reliable information comes from his own ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', which expounds his nationality, paternity, and native locality. Thucydides says that he fought in the war, contracted the plague, and was exiled by the [[Athenian democracy|democracy]]. He may have also been involved in quelling the [[Samian Revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|1|117|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evidence from the Classical period ===

Thucydides identifies himself as an [[Athenian]], telling us that his father's name was [[Olorus]] and that he was from the Athenian [[deme]] of [[Alimos|Halimous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|4|104|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; He survived the [[Plague of Athens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|2|48|1|3|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; which killed [[Pericles]] and many other Athenians. He also records that he owned [[gold mine]]s at [[Scapte Hyle]] (literally "Dug Woodland"), a coastal area in [[Thrace]], opposite the island of [[Thasos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|4|105|1|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amphipolis Cousinery.jpg|left|thumb|The ruins of [[Amphipolis]] as envisaged by E. Cousinéry in 1831: the bridge over the [[Strymon (river)|Strymon]], the city fortifications, and the acropolis]]
Because of his influence in the Thracian region, Thucydides wrote, he was sent as a [[strategos]] (general) to [[Thasos]] in 424 BC. During the winter of 424–423 BC, the Spartan general [[Brasidas]] attacked [[Amphipolis]], a half-day's sail west from Thasos on the Thracian coast, instigating the [[Battle of Amphipolis]]. [[Eucles]], the Athenian commander at Amphipolis, sent to Thucydides for help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|4|104|1|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brasidas, aware the presence of Thucydides on Thasos and his influence with the people of Amphipolis, and afraid of help arriving by sea, acted quickly to offer moderate terms to the Amphipolitans for their surrender, which they accepted. Thus, when Thucydides arrived, Amphipolis was already under Spartan control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|4|105|shortref}}–106.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Amphipolis was of considerable strategic importance, and news of its fall caused great consternation in Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|4|108|1|7|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was blamed on Thucydides, although he claimed that it was not his fault and that he had simply been unable to reach it in time. Because of his failure to save Amphipolis, he was [[exile]]d:&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|5|26|5|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I lived through the whole of it, being of an age to comprehend events, and giving my attention to them in order to know the exact truth about them. It was also my fate to be an exile from my country for twenty years after my command at [[Amphipolis]]; and being present with both parties, and more especially with the Peloponnesians by reason of my exile, I had leisure to observe affairs somewhat particularly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Using his status as an exile from Athens to travel freely among the Peloponnesian allies, he was able to view the war from the perspective of both sides. Thucydides claimed that he began writing his history as soon as the war broke out, because he thought it would be one of the greatest wars waged among the Greeks in terms of scale:&lt;blockquote&gt;Thucydides, an Athenian, wrote the history of the war between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians, beginning at the moment that it broke out, and believing that it would be a great war, and more worthy of relation than any that had preceded it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001.perseus-grc1:1.1.1|title=Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, book 1, chapter 1, section 1|website=data.perseus.org|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is all that Thucydides wrote about his own life, but a few other facts are available from reliable contemporary sources. [[Herodotus]] wrote that the name [[Olorus]], Thucydides's father's name, was connected with [[Thrace]] and Thracian royalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Herodotus|en|6|39|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thucydides was probably connected through family to the Athenian statesman and general [[Miltiades the Younger|Miltiades]] and his son [[Cimon]], leaders of the old [[aristocracy]] supplanted by the Radical [[democracy|Democrats]]. Cimon's maternal grandfather's name also was Olorus, making the connection exceedingly likely. Another [[Thucydides (politician)|Thucydides]] lived before the historian and was also linked with Thrace, making a family connection between them very likely as well. Finally, [[Herodotus]] confirms the connection of Thucydides's family with the mines at Scapté Hýlē.&lt;ref&gt;{{Herodotus|en|6|46|1|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining all the fragmentary evidence available, it seems that his family had owned a large estate in [[Thrace]], one that even contained gold mines, and which allowed the family considerable and lasting affluence. The security and continued prosperity of the wealthy estate must have necessitated formal ties with local kings or chieftains, which explains the adoption of the distinctly Thracian royal name ''Óloros'' into the family. Once exiled, Thucydides took permanent residence in the estate and, given his ample income from the gold mines, he was able to dedicate himself to full-time history writing and research, including many fact-finding trips. In essence, he was a well-connected gentleman of considerable resources who, after involuntarily retiring from the political and military spheres, decided to fund his own historical investigations.

=== Later sources ===

The remaining evidence for Thucydides's life comes from rather less reliable, later ancient sources. According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], someone named Oenobius was able to get a law passed allowing Thucydides to return to Athens, presumably sometime shortly after the city's surrender and the end of the war in 404 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+1.23.9 1.23.9].&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias goes on to say that Thucydides was murdered on his way back to Athens. Many doubt this account, seeing evidence to suggest he lived as late as 397 BC. [[Plutarch]] claims that his remains were returned to Athens and placed in [[Cimon]]'s family vault.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plut.+Cim.+4.1 Cimon 4.1].&lt;/ref&gt;

The abrupt end to Thucydides's narrative, which breaks off in the middle of the year 411 BC, has traditionally been interpreted that he died while writing the book, although other explanations have been put forward.

Inferences about Thucydides's character can only be drawn (with due caution) from his book. His sardonic sense of humour is evident throughout, as when, during his description of the [[Athenian plague]], he remarks that old Athenians seemed to remember a rhyme which said that with the Dorian War would come a "great death". Some claimed that the rhyme originally mentioned a [death by] "famine" or "starvation" ({{lang|grc|λιμός}}, ''{{transl|grc|limos}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/?hl=en#el/en/%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82|title=Μετάφραση Google|work=google.com|accessdate=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and was only remembered later as [death by] "pestilence" ({{lang|grc|λοιμός}}, ''{{transl|grc|loimos}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/?hl=en#el/en/%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82|title=Μετάφραση Google|work=google.com|accessdate=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) due to the current plague. Thucydides then remarks that should another Dorian War come, this time attended with a great dearth, the rhyme will be remembered as "dearth", and any mention of "death" forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|2|54|3|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thucydides admired [[Pericles]], approving of his power over the people and showing a marked distaste for the [[demagogue]]s who followed him. He did not approve of the democratic commoners nor the radical democracy that Pericles ushered in, but considered democracy acceptable when guided by a good leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|2|65|1|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thucydides's presentation of events is generally even-handed; for example, he does not minimize the negative effect of his own failure at [[Battle of Amphipolis|Amphipolis]]. Occasionally, however, strong passions break through, as in his scathing appraisals of the democratic leaders [[Cleon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|3|36|6|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|4|27|shortref}}, {{Thucydides|en|5|16|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hyperbolus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|8|73|3|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, Cleon has been connected with Thucydides's exile.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcellinus (writer)|Marcellinus]], ''Life of Thucydides'' 46&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that Thucydides was moved by the suffering inherent in war and concerned about the excesses to which human nature is prone in such circumstances, as in his analysis of the atrocities committed during the civil conflict on [[Corcyra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|3|82|shortref}}–83&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the phrase "war is a violent teacher" ({{lang|grc|πόλεμος βίαιος διδάσκαλος}}).

=== The ''History of the Peloponnesian War'' ===
{{Main|History of the Peloponnesian War}}
[[File:Attica 06-13 Athens 50 View from Philopappos - Acropolis Hill.jpg|thumb|The Acropolis in Athens]]
[[File:Sparta ruins.PNG|thumb|Ruins at Sparta]]
Thucydides believed that the Peloponnesian War represented an event of unmatched importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|1|1|1|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he began to write the ''History'' at the onset of the war in 431.&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|1|1|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Zagorin, Perez]]. ''Thucydides.'' (Princeton University Press, 2015), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; His intention was to write an account which would serve as "a possession for all time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|1|22|4|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''History'' breaks off near the end of the twenty-first year of the war and does not elaborate on the final conflicts of the war. This facet of the work suggests that Thucydides died whilst writing his history and more so, that his death was unexpected.

After his death, Thucydides's ''History'' was subdivided into eight books: its modern title is the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. His great contribution to history and [[historiography]] is contained in this one dense history of the [[Peloponnesian War|27-year war]] between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]], each alongside their respective allies. This subdivision was most likely made by librarians and archivists, themselves being historians and scholars, most likely working in the [[Library of Alexandria]].

The ''History of the Peloponnesian War'' continued to be modified well beyond the end of the war in 404, as exemplified by a reference at [[wikisource:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 1#1:13|Book I.1.13]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|chapter=Book 11#1:13|wslink=History of the Peloponnesian War|plaintitle=History of the Peloponnesian War|last=Thucydides|first=|}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the conclusion of the Peloponnesian War (404 BC), seven years after the last events in the main text of Thucydides' history.&lt;ref&gt;Mynott, Jeremy, ''The War of the Peloponnesians and Athenians''. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press (2013). p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Thucydides is generally regarded as one of the first true historians. Like his predecessor [[Herodotus]], known as "the father of history", Thucydides places a high value on [[eyewitness testimony]] and writes about events in which he probably took part. He also assiduously consulted written documents and interviewed participants about the events that he recorded. Unlike Herodotus, whose stories often teach that a hubris invites the wrath of the deities, Thucydides does not acknowledge divine intervention in human affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Michael|title=Greek and Roman Historians: Information and Misinformation|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415117704|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thucydides exerted wide historiographical influence on subsequent Hellenistic and Roman historians, although the exact description of his style in relation to many successive historians remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, Simon, Spawforth, Antony, Eidinow, Esther, ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary.'' New York, Oxford University Press (2012). pp. 692–693&lt;/ref&gt; Readers in antiquity often placed the continuation of the stylistic legacy of the ''History'' in the writings of Thucydides' putative intellectual successor [[Xenophon]]. Such readings often described Xenophon's treatises as attempts to "finish" Thucydides's ''History''. Many of these interpretations, however, have garnered significant scepticism among modern scholars, such as Dillery, who spurn the view of interpreting Xenophon ''qua'' Thucydides, arguing that the latter's "modern" history (defined as constructed based on literary and historical themes) is antithetical to the former's account in the ''[[Hellenica]]'', which diverges from the Hellenic historiographical tradition in its absence of a preface or introduction to the text and the associated lack of an "overarching concept" unifying the history.&lt;ref&gt;Dillery, John, ''Xenophon and the History of His Times''. London, Routledge (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

A noteworthy difference between Thucydides's method of writing history and that of modern historians is Thucydides's inclusion of lengthy formal speeches that, as he states, were literary reconstructions rather than quotations of what was said—or, perhaps, what he believed ''ought'' to have been said. Arguably, had he not done this, the gist of what was said would not otherwise be known at all—whereas today there is a plethora of documentation—written records, archives, and recording technology for historians to consult. Therefore, Thucydides's method served to ''rescue'' his mostly oral sources from oblivion. We do not know how these historical figures spoke. Thucydides's recreation uses a heroic stylistic register. A celebrated example is [[Pericles' funeral oration]], which heaps honour on the dead and includes a defence of democracy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole earth is the sepulchre of famous men; they are honoured not only by columns and inscriptions in their own land, but in foreign nations on memorials graven not on stone but in the hearts and minds of men. ([[wikisource:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:43|2:43]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stylistically, the placement of this passage also serves to heighten the contrast with the description of the plague in [[Athens]] immediately following it, which graphically emphasizes the horror of human mortality, thereby conveying a powerful sense of verisimilitude:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Though many lay unburied, birds and beasts would not touch them, or died after tasting them [...]. The bodies of dying men lay one upon another, and half-dead creatures reeled about the streets and gathered round all the fountains in their longing for water. The sacred places also in which they had quartered themselves were full of corpses of persons who had died there, just as they were; for, as the disaster passed all bounds, men, not knowing what was to become of them, became equally contemptuous of the property of and the dues to the deities. All the burial rites before in use were entirely upset, and they buried the bodies as best they could. Many from want of the proper appliances, through so many of their friends having died already, had recourse to the most shameless sepultures: sometimes getting the start of those who had raised a pile, they threw their own dead body upon the stranger's pyre and ignited it; sometimes they tossed the corpse which they were carrying on the top of another that was burning, and so went off. ([[wikisource:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 2#2:52|2:52]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thucydides omits discussion of the arts, literature, or the social milieu in which the events in his book take place and in which he grew up. He saw himself as recording an event, not a period, and went to considerable lengths to exclude what he deemed frivolous or extraneous.

== Philosophical outlook and influences ==

[[Paul Shorey]] calls Thucydides "a cynic devoid of moral sensibility".&lt;ref&gt;[[Zagorin, Perez]]. ''Thucydides.'' (Princeton University Press, 2015), p. 144.&lt;br&gt;Endnote cites: Paul Shorey, “On the Implicit Ethics and Psychology of Thucydides”&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he notes that Thucydides conceived of human nature as strictly determined by one's physical and social environments, alongside basic desires.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zagorin, Perez]]. ''Thucydides.'' (Princeton University Press, 2015), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thucydides' work indicates an influence from the teachings of the [[Sophist]]s that contributes substantially to the thinking and character of his ''History''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zagorin, Perez]]. ''Thucydides.'' (Princeton University Press, 2015), p. 22&lt;br&gt;The page itself refers to an endnote detailing that this conclusion is inspired by multiple works, including but not limited to: ''Athens as A Cultural Center'' by Martin Ostwald; ''Thucydides'' by John H. Finley; ''Intellectual Experiments of Greek Enlightenment'' by Friedrich Solmsen&lt;/ref&gt; Possible evidence includes his skeptical ideas concerning justice and morality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zagorin, Perez]]. ''Thucydides.'' (Princeton University Press, 2015), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also elements within the ''History''—such as his views on nature revolving around the factual, empirical, and the non-anthropomorphic—which suggest that he was at least aware of the views of philosophers such as [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Democritus]]. There is also evidence of his knowledge concerning some of the corpus of Hippocratic medical writings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zagorin, Perez]]. ''Thucydides.'' (Princeton University Press, 2015), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thucydides was especially interested in the relationship between human intelligence and judgment,&lt;ref&gt;[[Zagorin, Perez]]. ''Thucydides.'' (Princeton University Press, 2015), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Fortune and Necessity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Zagorin, Perez]]. ''Thucydides.'' (Princeton University Press, 2015), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; and the idea that history is too irrational and incalculable to predict.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zagorin, Perez]]. ''Thucydides.'' (Princeton University Press, 2015), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical interpretation ==

[[File:Thucydides-bust-cutout ROM.jpg|thumb|Bust of Thucydides residing in the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], [[Toronto]]]]

Scholars traditionally view Thucydides as recognizing and teaching the lesson that democracies need leadership, but that leadership can be dangerous to democracy. [[Leo Strauss]] (in ''The City and Man'') locates the problem in the nature of Athenian democracy itself, about which, he argued, Thucydides had a deeply ambivalent view: on one hand, Thucydides's own "wisdom was made possible" by the Periclean democracy, which had the effect of liberating individual daring, enterprise, and questioning spirit; but this same liberation, by permitting the growth of limitless political ambition, led to imperialism and, eventually, civic strife.&lt;ref&gt;Russett, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Canadian historian [[Charles Norris Cochrane]] (1889–1945), Thucydides's fastidious devotion to observable phenomena, focus on cause and effect, and strict exclusion of other factors anticipates twentieth-century scientific [[positivism]]. Cochrane, the son of a physician, speculated that Thucydides generally (and especially in describing the plague in Athens) was influenced by the methods and thinking of early medical writers such as [[Hippocrates]] of [[Kos]].&lt;ref name=Cochrane/&gt;

After World War II, [[Classical literature|classical]] scholar [[Jacqueline de Romilly]] pointed out that the problem of Athenian [[imperialism]] was one of Thucydides's central preoccupations and situated his history in the context of Greek thinking about international politics. Since the appearance of her study, other scholars further examined Thucydides's treatment of ''[[realpolitik]]''.

More recently, scholars have questioned the perception of Thucydides as simply, "the father of realpolitik". Instead they have brought to the fore the literary qualities of the ''History'', which they see as belonging to the narrative tradition of Homer and Hesiod and as concerned with the concepts of justice and suffering found in Plato and Aristotle and problematized in [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]].&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Orwin, ''The Humanity of Thucydides'', Princeton, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Ned Lebow]] terms Thucydides "the last of the tragedians", stating that "Thucydides drew heavily on epic poetry and tragedy to construct his history, which not surprisingly is also constructed as a narrative."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ned Lebow, ''The Tragic vision of Politics'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the blind and immoderate behaviour of the Athenians (and indeed of all the other actors)—although perhaps intrinsic to human nature—ultimately leads to their downfall. Thus his ''History'' could serve as a warning to future leaders to be more prudent, by putting them on notice that someone would be scrutinizing their actions with a historian's objectivity rather than a chronicler's flattery.&lt;ref&gt;See also Walter Robert Connor, ''Thucydides'' (Princeton University Press, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[J. B. Bury]] writes that the work of Thucydides "marks the longest and most decisive step that has ever been taken by a single man towards making history what it is today".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ancient Greek Historians|last=Bury|first=J. B.|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1958|isbn=|location=New York|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[H. D. F. Kitto|H. D. Kitto]] feels that Thucydides wrote about the Peloponnesian War, not because it was the most significant war in antiquity, but because it caused the most suffering. Indeed, several passages of Thucydides's book are written "with an intensity of feeling hardly exceeded by [[Sappho]] herself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowker|first=Stan|date=1966|title=Kitto At BC|url=https://newspapers.bc.edu/?a=d&amp;d=bcheights19660211.2.31|journal=The Heights|volume=XLVI| issue = 16|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', [[Karl Popper]] writes that Thucydides was the "greatest historian, perhaps, who ever lived". Thucydides's work, however, Popper goes on to say, represents "an interpretation, a point of view; and in this we need not agree with him". In the war between Athenian democracy and the "arrested oligarchic tribalism of Sparta", we must never forget Thucydides's "involuntary bias", and that "his heart was not with Athens, his native city":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Although he apparently did not belong to the extreme wing of the Athenian oligarchic clubs who conspired throughout the war with the enemy, he was certainly a member of the oligarchic party, and a friend neither of the Athenian people, the demos, who had exiled him, nor of its imperialist policy.&lt;ref name="PopperGombrich2013"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Karl Raimund |last1=Popper|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EaKc0RRqlvYC&amp;pg=PA169|year=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-15813-4|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Versus Herodotus ==

[[File:Herodot und Thukydides.jpg|thumb|Herodotus and Thucydides]]
Thucydides and his immediate predecessor, [[Herodotus]], both exerted a significant influence on Western historiography. Thucydides does not mention his counterpart by name, but his famous introductory statement is thought to refer to him:&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, How to write history, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|1|22|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;To hear this history rehearsed, for that there be inserted in it no fables, shall be perhaps not delightful. But he that desires to look into the truth of things done, and which (according to the condition of humanity) may be done again, or at least their like, shall find enough herein to make him think it profitable. And it is compiled rather for an everlasting possession than to be rehearsed for a prize. ([[wikisource:History of the Peloponnesian War/Book 1#1:22|1:22]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Herodotus records in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' not only the events of the [[Persian Wars]], but also geographical and ethnographical information, as well as the fables related to him during his extensive travels. Typically, he passes no definitive judgment on what he has heard. In the case of conflicting or unlikely accounts, he presents both sides, says what he believes and then invites readers to decide for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano, pp. 39, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Herodotus is reported to have been recited at festivals, where prizes were awarded, as for example, during the games at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucian: ''Herodotus'', pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus views history as a source of moral lessons, with conflicts and wars as misfortunes flowing from initial acts of injustice perpetuated through cycles of revenge.&lt;ref&gt;Ryszard Kapuscinski: ''Travels with Herodotus'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Thucydides claims to confine himself to factual reports of contemporary political and military events, based on unambiguous, first-hand, eye-witness accounts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Thucydides|en|1|23|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; although, unlike Herodotus, he does not reveal his sources. Thucydides views life exclusively as ''political'' life, and history in terms of ''political'' history. Conventional moral considerations play no role in his analysis of political events while geographic and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] aspects are omitted or, at best, of secondary importance. Subsequent Greek historians—such as [[Ctesias]], [[Diodorus]], [[Strabo]], [[Polybius]] and [[Plutarch]]—held up Thucydides's writings as a model of truthful history. [[Lucian]]&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, pp. 25, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to Thucydides as having given Greek historians their ''law'', requiring them to say ''what had been done'' ({{lang|grc|ὡς ἐπράχθη}}). Greek historians of the fourth century BC accepted that history was political and that contemporary history was the proper domain of a historian.&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano, Ch. 2, IV.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] calls Herodotus the "father of history";&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Laws'' 1.5.&lt;/ref&gt; yet the Greek writer Plutarch, in his ''[[Moralia]]'' (''Ethics'') denigrated Herodotus, notably calling him a ''philobarbaros'', a "barbarian lover", to the detriment of the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On the Malignity of Herodotus'', ''[[Moralia]]'' XI (''Loeb Classical Library 426'').&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Thucydides, however, these authors all continued to view history as a source of moral lessons.

Due to the loss of the ability to read Greek, Thucydides and Herodotus were largely forgotten during the [[Middle Ages]] in Western Europe, although their influence continued in the [[Byzantine]] world. In Europe, Herodotus become known and highly respected only in the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth century as an ethnographer, in part due to the discovery of [[The Americas|America]], where customs and animals were encountered that were even more surprising than what he had related. During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], moreover, information about Middle Eastern countries in the ''Histories'' provided a basis for establishing [[Bible|Biblical]] chronology as advocated by [[Isaac Newton]].

The first European translation of Thucydides (into Latin) was made by the humanist [[Lorenzo Valla]] between 1448 and 1452, and the first Greek edition was published by [[Aldus Manutius|Aldo Manuzio]] in 1502. During the [[Renaissance]], however, Thucydides attracted less interest among Western European historians as a political philosopher than his successor, [[Polybius]],&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano Chapter 2, V.&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Poggio Bracciolini]] claimed to have been influenced by him. There is not much evidence of Thucydides's influence in [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' (1513), which held that the chief aim of a new prince must be to "maintain his state" [i.e., his power] and that in so doing he is often compelled to act against faith, humanity, and religion. Later historians, such as [[J. B. Bury]], however, have noted parallels between them:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If, instead of a history, Thucydides had written an analytical treatise on politics, with particular reference to the Athenian empire, it is probable that&amp;nbsp;... he could have forestalled Machiavelli&amp;nbsp;... [since] the whole innuendo of the Thucydidean treatment of history agrees with the fundamental postulate of Machiavelli, the supremacy of [[national interest|reason of state]]. To maintain a state, said the Florentine thinker, "a statesman is often compelled to act against faith, humanity and religion".&amp;nbsp;... But&amp;nbsp;... the true Machiavelli, not the Machiavelli of fable&amp;nbsp;... entertained an ideal: Italy for the Italians, Italy freed from the stranger: and in the service of this ideal he desired to see his speculative science of politics applied. Thucydides has no political aim in view: he was purely a historian. But it was part of the method of both alike to eliminate conventional sentiment and morality.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. B. Bury]], ''The Ancient Greek Historians'' (London, MacMillan, 1909), pp. 140–143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]] translated Thucydides directly from Greek into English]]
In the seventeenth century, the [[England|English]] political philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]], whose ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' advocated absolute monarchy, admired Thucydides and in 1628 was the first to translate his writings into English directly from Greek. Thucydides, Hobbes, and Machiavelli are together considered the founding fathers of [[political realism]], according to which, state policy must primarily or solely focus on the need to maintain military and economic [[Power in international relations|power]] rather than on ideals or ethics.

Nineteenth-century [[positivist]] historians stressed what they saw as Thucydides's seriousness, his scientific objectivity and his advanced handling of evidence. A virtual [[cult following]] developed among such [[Germany|German]] philosophers as [[Friedrich Schelling]], [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who claimed that, "[in Thucydides], the portrayer of Man, that culture of the most impartial knowledge of the world finds its last glorious flower." The late-eighteenth-century Swiss historian [[Johannes von Müller]] described Thucydides as "the favourite author of the greatest and noblest men, and one of the best teachers of the wisdom of human life".&lt;ref&gt;Johannes von Müller, ''The History of the World'' (Boston: Thomas H. Webb and Co., 1842), Vol. 1, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Eduard Meyer]], [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] and [[Leopold von Ranke]], who initiated  modern source-based history writing,&lt;ref&gt;See Anthony Grafton, ''The Footnote, a Curious History'' (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Thucydides was again the model historian.&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For his part, Peter Green notes of these historians, the fact "That [Thucydides] was exiled for military incompetence, did a hatchet job on the man responsible and praised as virtually unbeatable the Spartan general to whom he had lost the key city of Amphipolis bothered them not at all." Peter Green (2008) cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Generals and statesmen loved him: the world he drew was theirs, an exclusive power-brokers' club. It is no accident that even today Thucydides turns up as a guiding spirit in military academies, [[neocon]] think tanks and the writings of men like [[Henry Kissinger]]; whereas Herodotus has been the choice of imaginative novelists (Michael Ondaatje's novel ''[[The English Patient]]'' and the film based on it boosted the sale of the ''Histories'' to a wholly unforeseen degree) and—as food for a starved soul—of an equally imaginative foreign correspondent from Iron Curtain Poland, [[Ryszard Kapuscinski]].&lt;ref&gt;(Green 2008, op. cit.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These historians also admired Herodotus, however, as social and ethnographic history increasingly came to be recognized as complementary to political history.&lt;ref&gt;Momigliano, p.&amp;nbsp;52.&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, this trend gave rise to the works of [[Johan Huizinga]], [[Marc Bloch]], and [[Fernand Braudel]], who pioneered the study of long-term cultural and economic developments and the patterns of everyday life. The [[Annales School]], which exemplifies this direction, has been viewed as extending the tradition of Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Clark (ed.): ''The Annales school: critical assessments'', Vol. II, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Thucydides's influence was increasingly important in the area of [[international relations]] during the Cold War, through the work of [[Hans Morgenthau]], [[Leo Strauss]],&lt;ref&gt;See essay on Thucydides in ''The Rebirth of Classical Political Rationalism: An Introduction to the Thought of Leo Strauss – Essays and Lectures by Leo Strauss'', edited by Thomas L. Pangle ([[Chicago]]: [[University of Chicago Press]], 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E. H. Carr|Edward Carr]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, E. H. Carr's ''[[The Twenty Years' Crisis]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tension between the Thucydidean and Herodotean traditions extends beyond historical research. According to [[Irving Kristol]], self-described founder of American [[neoconservatism]], Thucydides wrote "the favorite neoconservative text on foreign affairs";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/000tzmlw.asp|title=The Neoconservative Persuasion|work=weeklystandard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thucydides is a required text at the [[Naval War College]], an American institution located in Rhode Island. On the other hand, Daniel Mendelsohn, in a review of a recent edition of Herodotus, suggests that, at least in his graduate school days during the Cold War, professing admiration of Thucydides served as a form of self-presentation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To be an admirer of Thucydides' ''History'', with its deep cynicism about political, rhetorical and ideological hypocrisy, with its all too recognizable protagonists—a liberal yet imperialistic democracy and an authoritarian oligarchy, engaged in a [[war of attrition]] fought [[war by proxy|by proxy]] at the remote fringes of empire—was to advertise yourself as a hardheaded connoisseur of global Realpolitik.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/04/28/arms-and-the-man-3 Arms and the Man]: What was Herodotus trying to tell us?" (''[[The New Yorker]]'', April 28, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another author, [[Thomas Geoghegan]], whose speciality is [[labour rights]], comes down on the side of Herodotus when it comes to drawing lessons relevant to Americans, who, he notes, tend to be rather isolationist in their habits (if not in their political theorizing): "We should also spend more funds to get our young people out of the library where they're reading Thucydides and get them to start living like Herodotus—going out and seeing the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=12547 |title=The American Prospect |work=The American Prospect |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705045732/http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=12547 |archivedate=July 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another contemporary historian believes that,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorensen|first=Benjamin|date=2013|title=The Legacy of J. B.

{{TOC right}}

==1938==
* [[L. Ron Hubbard]] authors a manuscript called "[[Excalibur (L. Ron Hubbard)|Excalibur]]" which contains ideas that were later incorporated into Scientology.&lt;ref name="expreli"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chryssides, George D. |title=Exploring new religions |publisher=Cassell |location=London |year=1999 |pages=281 |isbn=0-8264-5959-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1949==
* First published work on Dianetics appeared in the Winter/Spring issue of the ''Explorers Club Journal'' entitled "Terra Incognita: The Mind". At this time, he offered his findings on the mind to both the [[American Medical Association]] and the [[American Psychiatric Association]]. Both organizations rejected them.&lt;ref name="parents"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg | first=Ellen|title=The Dangerous New Cult of Scientology|publisher=[[Parents (magazine)|Parents Magazine]]|date=June 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On May 9, 1950 L. Ron Hubbard's ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health|Dianetics — The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Of Two Minds | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,812852,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] | date = 1950-07-24 | accessdate = 2008-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  In August 1950, amidst the success of ''Dianetics'', Hubbard held a demonstration in Los Angeles' [[Shrine Auditorium]] where he presented a young woman called Sonya Bianca (a pseudonym) to a large audience including many reporters and photographers as "the world's first [[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]." However, despite Hubbard's claim that she had "full and perfect recall of every moment of her life", Bianca proved unable to answer questions from the audience testing her memory and analytical abilities, including the question of the color of Hubbard's tie.  Hubbard explained Bianca's failure to display her promised powers of recall to the audience by saying that he had used the word "now" in calling her to the stage, and thus inadvertently froze her in "present time", which blocked her abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Russell|last=Miller|title=Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard|year=1987|isbn=0-8050-0654-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atack"/&gt; Later, in the late 1950s, Hubbard would claim that several people had reached the state of Clear by the time he presented Bianca as the world's first; these others, Hubbard said, he had successfully cleared in the late 1940s while working ''incognito'' in Hollywood posing as a [[swami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech| first=L. Ron| last=Hubbard| title=The Story of Dianetics and Scientology, Lecture 18| date=October 1958| quote="by 1947, I had achieved clearing."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Hubbard declared South African Scientologist John McMaster to be the first true Clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Alan|last=Levy|title=Scientology|journal=Life|date=1968-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Wendy|last=Michener|title=Is This the Happiest Man in the World?|journal=Maclean's|date=1966-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMaster left the [[Sea Org]] in November 1969, expressing continuing belief in the Scientology [[Scientology beliefs and practices|Tech]], but disapproval of the way Scientology was managed.&lt;ref name="atack"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jon|last=Atack|title=A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L.

[[Image:Trialtrenches.jpg|thumb|Archaeological trial trenches]]
'''Trial trenching''' is a rapid and inexpensive method of [[archaeological evaluation]] used to estimate the archaeological potential of a site.

Trenches are located at intervals across a site leaving the rest untouched. A mechanical excavator is used to dig down to archaeological features or natural geological deposits and any archaeology is recorded. No further excavation takes place at this stage. The results of the trial trenching are used to inform any future stage of work which may extend to full [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] of the rest of the site if the evaluation reveals significant finds.

There is some argument over the [[sampling strategy]] to be employed in trial trenching, especially in evaluating sites that are intended for development. Issues such as the effectiveness of certain trench layouts or the percentage of the site to be dug (normally around 5% at present) are widely discussed.  Whether an effective picture of past human activity on a site can be truly estimated through this methods is widely debated. Development can destroy buried archaeology forever and a reliable evaluation methodology is very important. Whilst it is difficult to quantify the number of [[Type I and type II errors|false negative]] results there have certainly been examples of evaluations suggesting a relatively limited amount of past activity which has had to be upwardly revised during the excavation.

In the UK the results of the trial trenching will be used to inform the decision on the need for any further archaeological work to be undertaken prior to development. This process is enshrined in [[PPG 16]] and [[English Heritage]]'s ''Management of Archaeological Projects'' colloquially known as [[MAP 2]].

[[File:Konstanzer Richental Chronik Der Papst auf Reisen - Vortragen der Monstranz 6v.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Image from the [[Chronicle of the Council of Constance]] by Ulrich of Richenthal]]
'''Ulrich of Richenthal''' (died c. 1438) was a chronicler of the [[Council of Constance]].

Ulrich was a citizen of [[Konstanz]] (Constance), he was a landowner and a layman, perhaps a son of the town clerk of Constance, Johannes Richenthal, who lived in the second half of the fourteenth century. During the session of the Ecumenical Council of Constance Ulrich frequently came into connection with the fathers assembled. He met the papal delegates who had to provide quarters for the members of the council. He was employed in business matters by princes who were present in the city during the council, and a bishop lived in his house. Ulrich followed the council, the great events that took place in it, the festivities, and all the celebrations of which his native town was the theatre. He wrote in the [[German language|German]] [[dialect]] of Konstanz an exact and careful account of all, introducing much statistical matter. This chronicle is preserved in several manuscripts, of which one at [[St. Petersburg]] is in Latin. The Manuscripts contain [[coats-of-arms]] and other illustrations valuable for the history of civilization.

'''[[United Nations]] [[List of UN Security Council Resolutions|Security Council Resolution]] 340''' was adopted on October 25, 1973, during the [[Yom Kippur War]]. It was passed after the Security Council was informed of the apparent failure of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|UNSCR 338]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 339|UNSCR 339]] to end the fighting.

In UNSCR 340, the Council demanded that the belligerent parties cease fire immediately and completely, and return to the positions occupied by them at 1650 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on 22 October 1973.

The Council also

* Requested the [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] to increase the number of United Nations military observers on both sides of the cease-fire lines.
* Set up a [[United Nations Emergency Force]] to be composed of personnel drawn from UN member states except [[United Nations Security Council#Permanent members|the permanent members of the Security Council]].
* Requested the Secretary-General to report back within 24 hours on these two provisions.
* Requested the Secretary-General report back on a continuing basis on the implementation of this resolution, as well as 338 and 339, and requested all member states to co-operate fully in the implementation of these resolutions.

The resolution was adopted with 14 votes to none. The [[People's Republic of China]] did not vote or formally abstain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2270">'''Walter Jenkin Evans''' (1 April 1856 &amp;ndash; 10 February 1927) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[academic]] who served as [[Principal (university)|Principal]] of [[Carmarthen Presbyterian College]] and who wrote about the history and people of [[Unitarianism]] in [[Carmarthen]].

==Life==
Evans was born on 1 April 1856 at [[Carmarthen]], south Wales. After schooling in [[Parc-y-felfed]] and at Carmarthen grammar school, he went to Carmarthen Presbyterian College from 1870 to 1873, then to [[Jesus College, Oxford]] and [[Manchester College, Oxford]], obtaining his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1878 and his [[MA Oxon|MA]] in 1880.   After teaching in London and in Brighton from 1879 to 1884, he returned to Carmarthen Presbyterian College in 1884 as tutor in Latin and Greek.  In 1888, he became Principal (the appointment attracting some controversy at the time on theological grounds).  He helped to establish good links between the college and the [[University of Wales]] during his time in office, and served as Dean of Divinity for the University from 1910 to 1913.  He died on 10 February 1927.&lt;ref name=WBO/&gt;

==Works==
Whilst Evans published some research on Latin poetry (''Alliteratio Latina, or Alliteration in Latin Verse'', 1921), his main work was on the history of [[Unitarianism]].  He wrote on the history of Carmarthen Academy and on the history of Unitarianism in Carmarthen, and also penned biographies of Unitarian students from Carmarthen.  The [[National Library of Wales]] holds six manuscript volumes of his biographies and notes on the history of his denomination.&lt;ref name=WBO&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-EVAN-JEN-1856.html|title= Evans, Walter Jenkin (1856&amp;ndash;1927), principal of Carmarthen Presbyterian College|first=Thomas Oswald|last=Williams|work=Welsh Biography Online|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|accessdate=2009-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation''' (DAHP) is an independent government agency in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] which serves several functions, including regulatory functions. The agency inventories and regulates [[archaeological sites]]; houses Washington's [[State Historic Preservation Officer]], State Archaeologist, State Architectural Historian and State Physical Anthropologist; maintains the Washington Heritage Register and [[Heritage Barn]] Register; provides expertise on environmental impacts to cultural resources; administers [[historic preservation]] grants for heritage barns and historic county courthouses; encourages historic preservation through local governments; provides technical assistance for historic rehabilitation and using historic preservation tax credits; and maintains extensive GIS databases to catalog the state's historic and prehistoric cultural resources. 

DAHP reviews an impressive number of projects. In Washington's 2008 fiscal year (July 1, 2007-June 30, 2008), DAHP reviewed 4,911 projects through the Section 106 process, 2,688 projects through the State SEPA process, and 1,336 reviews through the EO 0505 process.&lt;ref&gt;"2008 Workload Trends" Government Management Accountability and Performance. Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation. Olympia, WA. July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Washington's State Historic Preservation Office was first created by Washington State Bill 363 in 1967. Within a year, the State Advisory Board convened for the first time, and it was staffed by the State Parks Department. Funding for the program was not secured until 1973, and coincided with the creation of the Washington Heritage Register. In 1975, the first Washington SHPO was appointed. The office bounced around for a time, cycling between independent agency and housed within another state agency. Most recently, DAHP became an independent agency after leaving the Washington State Department of Community, Trade and Economic Development (now the Washington State Department of Commerce, formerly the Department of Community Development and the Department of Trade and Economic Development) as the Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation.&lt;ref&gt;"Timeline" Michael Houser, Washington State Historic Preservation Office. http://www.dahp.wa.gov/pages/AboutUs/documents/WASTATESHPOTIMELINE_001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

DAHP was made into a state agency by the [[Washington State Legislature|Washington State HB 1706-2005]], and was codified into the Revised Code of Washington, 43.334.&lt;ref&gt;HB 1706-2005 http://apps.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1706.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RCW 43.334 http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.334&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agency Functions==

===State Historic Preservation Officer===
DAHP houses Washington's State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), a position created by the National Historic Preservation Act.&lt;ref&gt;National Historic Preservation Act, Section 101 http://www.achp.gov/docs/nhpa%202008-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The SHPO conducts reviews of the impacts to historic resources caused by construction funded by federal dollars under the authority of the National Historic Preservation Act, section 101.&lt;ref&gt;NHPA; Public Law 89-665; 16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.)&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Christine Gregoire]]'s 2005 executive order, EO 05-05, further extended the Washington SHPO's authority to include the review of capital projects using state dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Executive Order 05-05 http://www.governor.wa.gov/execorders/eo_05-05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Washington State designates DAHP as an agency with expertise in cultural resources under the State Environmental Protection Act (SEPA).&lt;ref&gt;WAC 197-11-920 http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=197-11-920&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Washington State Historic Preservation Officer is Dr. Allyson Brooks.&lt;ref&gt;DAHP Staff Directory http://www.dahp.wa.gov/pages/AboutUs/Staff.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor's Advisory Board on Historic Preservation===
DAHP staffs the Governor's Advisory Board on Historic Preservation, which was established by RCW 27.34.250-330. The Board meets three or four times a year and reviews applications to the Washington Heritage Register and the National Register of Historic Places . It has nine members, including a representative of local or state heritage organizations, six members of the public who are interested and experienced in issues of preservation or archaeology, a representative from the Washington archaeological community, and a representative of the Native American community. Terms are four years.

===Archaeology Regulation===
Through Section 106 reviews (pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act), and Washington's SEPA, DAHP reviews construction projects using federal or state monies for impacts to archaeological resources. Washington's archaeological resources are rich as [[History of Washington (state)#Prehistory|evidence of human activity stretches almost 13,000 years.]] Archaeology reviews are carried out by professional staff archaeologists. The current Washington State Archaeologist is Dr. Rob Whitlam. 

DAHP assigns site number ([[Smithsonian trinomial]]s) for archaeological sites, and maintains a database of over 18,000 archaeological sites in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Archaeology and DAHP http://www.dahp.wa.gov/pages/Archaeology/Survey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; DAHP also regulates archaeological excavation in the state, and issues permits to applicants.&lt;ref&gt;RCW 27.53: Permit Regulation Authority http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=27.53.060&lt;/ref&gt; As archaeological records are confidential and exempt from public disclosure laws, DAHP also regulates research by archaeological consultants. To expand the ease and streamline construction planning, DAHP has created a pre-contact archaeological predictive model, which will give an overview of the likelihood of finding archaeological resources in any given area of the state.

===Built Environment===
The agency also features a robust [[built environment]] staff who review construction impacts to historic properties. This unit provides some technical assistance in historic preservation standards to local jurisdictions in addition to conducting reviews of historic resources. DAHP keeps track of Washington's properties on the National Register of Historic Places, as well as the Washington Heritage Register&lt;ref&gt;Washington Heritage Register http://www.dahp.wa.gov/pages/HistoricSites/documents/HistoricPlacesinWashingtonReport_006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the Heritage Barn Register.
The current Washington State Architectural Historian is Michael Houser.

===Heritage Barns===
Substitute House bill 2115-2007&lt;ref&gt;SHB 2115 http://www.leg.wa.gov/pub/billinfo/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/House%20Passed%20Legislature/2115-S.PL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; established the Washington State Barn Preservation program, and charged DAHP with maintaining a Heritage Barn Register and administering grants programs for heritage barn owners. DAHP also staffs a Heritage Barn Preservation Advisory Board, which reviews applicants for heritage barn status.

===Human Remains===
DAHP was given statutory authority over all non-[[forensic science|forensic human remains]] found in the state by HB 2624-2008.&lt;ref&gt;HB 2624-2008 http://www.leg.wa.gov/pub/billinfo/2007-08/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2624-S.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; RCW 43.334.075 &lt;ref&gt;RCW 43.334.075 http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.334.075&lt;/ref&gt; requires that the State Physical Anthropologist hold a PhD in archaeology or anthropology or have an MD with experience in archaeology. DAHP gained jurisdiction starting in Washington State FY09 (July 1, 2008).

The State Physical Anthropologist's primary responsibility is determining the origin and ethnicity of human remains, and repatriating these remains to the appropriate parties. The position was filled in August, 2008 by Dr. Guy Tasa.
