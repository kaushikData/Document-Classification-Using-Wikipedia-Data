      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6626">In [[mathematics]], '''abstract nonsense''', '''general abstract nonsense''', '''generalized abstract nonsense''', and '''general nonsense''' are terms used by [[mathematician]]s to describe abstract methods related to [[category theory]] and [[homological algebra]]. More generally, “abstract nonsense” may refer to a proof that relies on category-theoretic methods, or even to the study of category theory itself.

==Background==

Roughly speaking, category theory is the study of the general form, that is, categories of mathematical theories, without regard to their content.  As a result, [[mathematical proof]]s that rely on category-theoretic ideas often seem out of context, somewhat akin to a [[non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]].  Authors sometimes dub these proofs “abstract nonsense” as a light-hearted way of alerting readers to their abstract nature.  Labeling an argument "abstract nonsense" is usually ''not'' intended to be derogatory,&lt;ref name="monastyrsky"&gt;Michael Monastyrsky, ''Some Trends in Modern Mathematics and the Fields Medal.'' Can. Math. Soc. Notes, March and April 2001, Volume 33, nos. 2 and 3.  Online version available at http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/aboutus/FieldsMedal_Monastyrsky.pdf.
:"''In algebra, the term “abstract nonsense” has a definite meaning without any pejorative connotation.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mathworld" /&gt; and is instead used jokingly,&lt;ref name="maclane"/&gt; in a [[self-deprecating]] way,&lt;ref name="rotman"/&gt; affectionately,&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt; or even as a compliment to the generality of the argument.

Certain ideas and constructions in mathematics share a uniformity throughout many domains, unified by category theory. Typical methods include the use of [[classifying space]]s and [[universal property|universal properties]], use of the [[Yoneda lemma]], [[natural transformation]]s between [[functor]]s, and [[diagram chasing]].

When an audience can be assumed to be familiar with the general form of such arguments, mathematicians will use the expression ''Such and such is true by abstract nonsense'' rather than provide an elaborate explanation of particulars.&lt;ref name="mathworld"&gt;{{MathWorld| urlname=AbstractNonsense | title=Abstract Nonsense|author=Macura, Wiktor K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one might say ''By abstract nonsense, [[product (category theory)|products]] are unique up to isomorphism when they exist'', instead of arguing about how these isomorphisms can be derived from the [[universal property]] that defines the product. This allows one to skip proof details that can be considered trivial or not providing much insight, focusing instead on genuinely innovative parts of a larger proof.

==History==

The term predates the foundation of category theory as a subject itself. Referring to a joint paper with [[Samuel Eilenberg]] that introduced the notion of a "[[category (mathematics)|category]]" in 1942, [[Saunders Mac Lane]] wrote the subject was 'then called "general abstract nonsense"'.&lt;ref name="maclane"&gt;Saunders Mac Lane. "[http://www.pnas.org/content/94/12/5983.full The PNAS way back then]". ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA'' Vol. 94, pp.&amp;nbsp;5983–5985, June 1997.
:"''The first of these papers is a more striking case; it introduced the very abstract idea of a "category"—a subject then called "general abstract nonsense"!''"&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used to describe the application of category theory and its techniques to less abstract domains.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040726025100/http://www.csupomona.edu/~jis/1999/lord.pdf An Application of Abstract Nonsense to Surface Area], Harriet Lord&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edsko.net/tcd/talks/cattheory.pdf Abstract Nonsense for Functional Programmers], Edsko de Vries&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is believed to have been coined by the mathematician [[Norman Steenrod]],&lt;ref&gt;Colin McLarty, ''The Uses and Abuses of the History of Topos Theory'', Br. J. Philos. Sci., 41 (1990) p 355.
: "''Steenrod jokingly tagged category theory 'abstract nonsense' and made it central to his axiomatics for homology''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rotman"&gt;Joseph Rotman, "''An Introduction to Homological Algebra'', by Charles A. Weibel" (book review), Bull. Am. Math. Soc., 33:4 (Oct. 1996) 473–476.
:"''The self-deprecating phrase ''general abstract nonsense'' (due to Steenrod) was promulgated by Eilenberg and Mac Lane, two of the major innovators of homological algebra, to highlight this aspect of the subject.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lang"&gt;[[Serge Lang]], "Algebra" Second Edition, Addison Wesley, 1984, p 175&lt;/ref&gt; himself one of the developers of the categorical point of view.

==Examples==

Consider the example of showing that a [[3-manifold]] ''M'' admits a [[map (mathematics)|map]] to the [[2-sphere]] that is non-trivial (i.e. non-homotopic to a constant map), when the 2nd [[Betti number]] of ''M'' is positive. This means the 2nd [[cohomology group]] has positive [[Rank of an abelian group|rank]] (by the  [[universal coefficient theorem for cohomology]]), so it has a non-zero element. The [[Cohomology#Eilenberg–MacLane spaces|properties of Eilenberg–MacLane space]]s then give a corresponding non-trivial map ''f'' from ''M'' to the infinite-dimensional [[complex projective space]] '''CP'''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;, since it is a [[K(Z,2)|''K''('''Z''',2)]] [[Eilenberg–MacLane space]]. The space '''CP'''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; can be realized as a [[CW complex]] with exactly one cell in each even dimension and no cells in odd dimension, while ''M'' can be realized with no cells in dimensions above 3, so by the [[cellular approximation theorem]] there is a map homotopic to ''f'' that maps ''M'' into the 3-skeleton of '''CP'''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the 2-sphere.

Though this proof establishes the truth of the statement in question, the proof technique has little to do with the [[topology]] or [[geometry]] of the 2-sphere, let alone 3-manifolds, as it relies on more general categorical principles.  Because of the reliance on these abstract principles, the result is independent of subtler geometric details, so offers little geometric insight into the nature of such a map.  On the other hand, the proof is surprisingly short and clean, and a “hands-on” approach involving the explicit construction of such a map would be potentially laborious.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="118465">{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''achievement gap in the United States''' is the observed, persistent disparity in measures of educational performance among subgroups of U.S. students, especially groups defined by [[socioeconomic status]] (SES), [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]/[[ethnicity]] and [[gender]]. The achievement gap can be observed on a variety of measures, including [[standardized test]] scores, [[grade point average]], [[Dropping out|dropout]] rates, and college enrollment and completion rates. While this article focuses on the achievement gap in the United States, the gap in achievement between lower income students and higher income students exists in all nations&lt;ref&gt;Carnoy &amp; Rothstein, [http://www.epi.org/blog/international-tests-achievement-gaps-gains-american-students/ "International Tests Show Achievement Gaps in All Countries"], Economic Policy Institute, January 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been studied extensively in the U.S. and other countries, including the U.K.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rowntree Bawlls vs Lunch [http://www.jrf.org.uk/work/workarea/education-and-poverty "Education and Poverty"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324140816/http://www.jrf.org.uk/work/workarea/education-and-poverty |date=March 24, 2013 }}, "How Does Poverty Affect Children's Education?"&lt;/ref&gt; Various other gaps between groups exist around the globe as well.

Research into the causes of the disparity in academic achievement between students from different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds has been ongoing since the 1966 publication of the Coleman Report (officially titled "Equality of Educational Opportunity"), commissioned by the [[U.S. Department of Education]], which found that a combination of home, community, and in-school factors affect academic performance and contribute to the achievement gap. According to American educational psychologist [[David Berliner]], home and community environments have a stronger impact on school achievement than in-school factors, in part, because students spend more time outside of school than in school. In addition, the out-of-school factors influencing academic performance differ significantly between children living in poverty and children from middle-income households.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, D., [http://nepc.colorado.edu/files/PB-Berliner-NON-SCHOOL.pdf "Poverty and Potential: Out-of-School Factors and School Success"], Education Public Interest Center, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, D., [http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=12106 "Our Impoverished View of Educational Reform"], Teachers College Record, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement gap, as reported in trend data collected by the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP), has become a focal point of [[education reform]] efforts by a number of nonprofit organizations and advocacy groups. Attempts to minimize the achievement gap by improving equality of access to educational opportunities have been numerous but fragmented, such as [[affirmative action]], [[multicultural education]], finance equalization,{{clarify|date=May 2017}} and interventions to improve school testing, teacher quality and accountability.

==Racial achievement gap==
{{main|Racial achievement gap in the United States}}{{see also|National Assessment of Educational Progress|Race and intelligence}}
The [[education of African Americans]] and some other minorities lags behind those of other [[United States|U.S.]] ethnic groups, such as [[White people|Whites]] and [[Asian Americans]], as reflected by test scores, grades, urban high school graduation rates, rates of disciplinary action, and rates of conferral of undergraduate degrees. Indeed, high school graduation rates and college enrollment rates are comparable to those of whites 25 or 30 years ago. It should also be noted that the category of [[Africans in the United States|African immigrant]] population (excluding Haitians and other foreign-born blacks born outside of Africa) has the highest educational attainment of any group in the United States, but they represent a small group within the larger African American population.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census http://www.asian-nation.org/immigrant-stats.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asian Americans|East Asian Americans]] of [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[Koreans|Korean]] descent score the highest in all scholastic standardized tests such as the [[SAT]], [[Graduate Record Examinations|GRE]], [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]], [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|USMLE]] exams and [[Intelligence quotient|IQ tests]] followed by [[Caucasian race|caucasian]] [[White people]] who score in the intermediate range followed by [[African-American]] and [[Hispanic]] students who tend to score in the lower ranges. U.S. students as whole have in general attained average scores on the [[Programme for International Student Assessment|International PISA test]] while other wealthy [[industrialized]] [[developed country|developed]] [[East Asian]] countries, such as [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[Singapore]] and [[South Korea]] have the highest top scores. However, compared with children in some less developed countries like Benin where some children, especially girls, end their education after the elementary level, education in the United States is compulsory to age 16 regardless of race or class. It is expected that over half of public education students will be required to pass [[high school graduation examination|standards-based assessments]] which expect that all students to be at least exposed to algebra by high school and exit prepared for college. In many other nations, such as Germany and Japan, those with lower test scores may be tracked as skilled tradepersons or unskilled laborers.

Nowadays, there's a gaining population of students who use online education, and the number of institutions which offering fully online degrees is also increasing. According to several studies, online education probably could create an environment where there is less cultural division and negative stereotypes of African Americans, thus protecting those students who have had bad experiences. In addition, the influence technology and user skills and so as economics and academic influences are tightly bonded, that may have positively contributed to African American online learners experience. However, it appears African American male students are less likely to enroll in online classes.

===Evidence of the racial achievement gap: National Assessment of Educational Progress (United States)===

{{Main|National Assessment of Educational Progress}}
[[Racial achievement gap in the United States#Evidence of the racial achievement gaps|Evidence of the achievement gap]] can be found using various measures, but one assessment used nationwide is the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The graphs below show the achievement gap on this assessment between black and white students and between Hispanic and white students in the U.S. over time. Although the gaps have generally narrowed in recent years according to this particular measure, there are clearly still large disparities between groups.

===Debate on the origins of the racial achievement gap===
Researchers have not reached consensus about the [[Racial achievement gap in the United States#Theories about the origin of the racial achievement gap|causes of the academic achievement gap]]; instead, there exists a wide range of studies that cite an array of factors, both cultural and structural, that influence student performance in school. Annette Lareau suggested that students who lack middle-class [[cultural capital]] and have limited parental involvement are likely to have lower academic achievement than their better resourced peers.&lt;ref&gt;''Social Class Differences in Family-School Relationships: The Impact of Cultural Capital'' Annette Lareau, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers suggest that academic achievement is more closely tied to race and [[socioeconomic status]] and have tried to pinpoint why.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Tracking: From Theory to Practice'' Maureen Hallinan 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic factors were identified as lack of online course access (McCoy, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, K. L. (2012). A study of African American males and their response to online learning (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database. (UMI No. 3546682) &lt;/ref&gt; and online course attrition which indicated before (Liu et al., 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Liu, S., Gomez, J., Khan, B., &amp; Yen, C.J. (2007). Toward a learneroriented community college online course dropout framework. International Journal on ELearning, 6(4), 519–542. &lt;/ref&gt;. Based on the National Center for Educational Statistic (2015)&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics. (2011). The condition of education, 2011. (NCES 2011033), Indicator 43. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2011033&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;, about half of African American male students grew up in single-parent households. They are associated with higher incidences of poverty, which leads to poorer educational outcomes (Child Trends Databank, 2015). Low-income households tend to have fewer home computers and less access to the Internet (Zickuhr &amp; Smith, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;Zickuhr, K., &amp; Smith, A. (2012). Digital differences. Pew Research Center’s Internet &amp; American Life Project, Washington, D.C., 1–41. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Digital&lt;/nowiki&gt; differences.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

For example, being raised in a low-income family often means having fewer educational resources in addition to poor nutrition and limited access to health care, all of which could contribute to lower academic performance. Researchers concerned with the achievement gap between genders cite biological differences, such as brain structure and development, as a possible reason why one gender outperforms the other in certain subjects. For example, a Virginia Tech Study conducted in 2000 examined the brains of 508 children and found that different areas of the brain develop in a different sequence in girls compared to boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanlon|first=Harriet|author2=Robert Thatcher |author3=Marvin Cline|title=Gender Differences in the Development of EEG Coherence in Normal Children|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|year=1999|volume=16|issue=3|pages=479–506|doi=10.1207/s15326942dn1603_27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differing maturation speed of the brain between boys and girls affects how each gender processes information and could have implications for how they perform in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sax|first=Leonard|title=Why Gender Matters: What Parents and Teachers Need to Know about the Emerging Science of Sex Differences|year=2005|publisher=Doubleday|location=Portland}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Hernstein and Murray claimed in the book ''[[The Bell Curve]]'',&lt;ref name="X"&gt;Hernstein, R. J., and C. Murray, ''The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life'' (The Free Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; creating much controversy, that [[Race and intelligence|genetic variation in average levels of intelligence]] (IQ) may explain some portion of the racial disparities in achievement. Other researchers have argued that there is no significant difference in inherent cognitive ability between different races that could help to explain the achievement gap, and that environment is at the root of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;"Genetic Differences and School Readiness" William T. Dickens, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Race, IQ, and Jensen" James R. Flynn (London: Routledge, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nisbett, Richard. “Race, Genetics, and IQ,” in The Black-White Test Score Gap, edited by Christopher Jencks and Meredith Phillips (Brookings, 1998), pp. 86–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The racial achievement gap in early childhood====
Research shows that the achievement gap, which often is first measured (by standardized tests) in elementary school, actually begins well before students reach kindergarten as a “school readiness” gap.&lt;ref&gt;"School Readiness: Closing Racial and Ethnic Gaps" Cecilia Rouse, Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, &amp; Sara McLanahan, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; One study claims that about half the test score gap between black and white high school students is already evident when children start school.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Phillips, James Crouse, and John Ralph, “Does the Black-White Test Score Gap Widen after Children Enter School?” in The Black-White Test Score Gap, edited by Jencks and Phillips (Brookings, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of different tests at kindergarten entry have provided evidence of such a gap, including the U.S. Department of Education's Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey of Kindergarten children (ECLS-K). While results differ depending on the instrument, estimates of the black-white gap range from slightly less than half a standard deviation to slightly more than 1 standard deviation.&lt;ref&gt;"Assessment Issues in the Testing of Children at School Entry" Donald A. Rock and A. Jackson Stenner, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

This early disparity in performance is critical, as research shows that once students are behind, they do not catch up. Children who score poorly on tests of cognitive skills before starting kindergarten are highly likely to be low performers throughout their school careers.&lt;ref&gt;"School Readiness and Later Achievement" G. J. Duncan et al, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence of the early appearance of the gap has led to efforts focused on early childhood interventions (see “Narrowing the achievement gap” below).

====African American culture and family structure====
{{Further|African American culture|African-American family structure}}

Achievement gaps between African American students and White students in online classes tend to be greater than regular class. Expanding from 14% in 1995 to 22% in 2015 (National Center for Education Statistics, 2016)&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics. (2016). Educational attainment of young adults, 2016. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=27&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;. Possible cause might be the differences in socio-economic status (Palmer et al., 2013)&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, G. A., Bowman, L., &amp; Harroff, P. (2013). Literature review: Barriers to participation in the online learning environment: The role of race and gender. Adult Education Research Conference. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://newprairiepress.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024&amp;context=aerc&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;, academic performance differences (Osborne, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, J. (2001). Testing stereotype threat: Does anxiety explain race and sex differences in achievement? Contemporary Educational Psychology, 26(3), 291–310. doi:10.1006/ceps.2000.1052 &lt;/ref&gt;, unable to access technology (Fairlie, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;Fairlie, R. W. (2012a).

(2005). Learning and sense of community: A comparative analysis of African American and Caucasian online graduate students.

Testing stereotype threat: Does anxiety explain race and sex differences in achievement? Contemporary Educational Psychology, 26(3), 291–310. doi:10.1006/ceps.2000.1052 &lt;/ref&gt;. 

The culture and environment in which children are raised may play a role in the achievement gap. Jencks and Phillips argue that African American parents may not encourage early education in toddlers because they do not see the personal benefits of having exceptional academic skills. As a result of cultural differences, African American students tend to begin school with smaller vocabularies than their white classmates.&lt;ref name="jencks&amp;phillips"&gt;''America's Next Achievement Test: Closing the Black-White Test Score Gap'' Christopher Jencks and Meredith Phillips 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Hart and Risley calculated a "[[30 million word gap]]" between children of high school dropouts and those of professionals who are college educated. The differences are qualitative as well as quantitative, with differences in "unique" words, complexity, and "conversational turns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sparks|first1=Sarah D.|title=Research on Quality of Conversation Holds Deeper Clues Into Word Gap|work=Education Week|publisher=Educational Projects in Education, Inc.|date=April 22, 2015|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, poverty often acts as a confounding factor and differences that are assumed to arise from racial/cultural factors may be socioeconomically driven. Many children who are poor, regardless of race, come from homes that lack stability, continuity of care, adequate nutrition, and medical care creating a level of environmental stress that can affect the young child's development. As a result, these children enter school with decreased word knowledge that can affect their language skills, influence their experience with books, and create different perceptions and expectations in the classroom context.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Hart and Risley (1995). Meaningful differences in the every day experiences of young children. Baltimore, MD: Paul H Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies show that when students have parental assistance with homework, they perform better in school.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Immigration, Family Life, and Achievement Motivation Among Latino Adolescents'' Carola Suarez-Orozco and Marcelo Suarez-Orozco 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This is a problem for many minority students due to the large number of single-parent households ([[African-American family structure|67% of African-American children are in a single-parent household]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/acrossstates/Rankings.aspx?ind=107|title=Children in single-parent families by race|publisher=|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the increase in non-English speaking parents. Students from single-parent homes often find it difficult to find time to receive help from their parent. Similarly, some Hispanic students have difficulty getting help with their homework because there is not an English speaker at home to offer assistance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==== Hispanic views toward education ====
Disadvantages in a child's early life can cultivate into achievement gaps in their education. Poverty, coupled with the environment they are raised in, can lead to shortcomings in educational achievement. Despite strong standards and beliefs in education, Hispanic children consistently perform poorly, reflected by a low average of math and reading scores, as compared to other groups except African American.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Digest of Education Statistics|url=http://choicereviews.org/review/10.5860/CHOICE.51-5366|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=51|issue=10|pages=51–5366–51-5366|doi=10.5860/choice.51-5366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hispanic and African American children have been shown to be more likely to be raised in poverty, with 33% of Hispanic families living below the [[Poverty in the United States|economic poverty level]], compared to African American (39%), Asian (14%) and White (13%) counterparts.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Children who are raised in poverty are less likely to be enrolled in nursery or preschool. Though researchers are seeing improvements in achievement levels, such as a decrease in high school dropout rates (from 24% to 17%) and a steady increase in math and reading scores over the past 10 years,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; there are still issues that must be addressed.

There is a common misconception that Hispanic parents are not involved in their child's education and fail to transmit strong educational values to their children. However, there is evidence that Hispanic parents actually hold their children's education in high value. The majority of Hispanic children are affected by [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]]. It affects recent immigrants as well as the children of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valencia|first=Richard R.|date=2002-04-01|title="Mexican Americans Don't Value Education!" On the Basis of the Myth, Mythmaking, and Debunking|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S1532771XJLE0102_2|journal=Journal of Latinos and Education|volume=1|issue=2|pages=81–103|doi=10.1207/s1532771xjle0102_2|issn=1534-8431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both recent immigrants and the children of immigrants are faced with language barriers and other migration obstacles. A study explored the unique situation and stressors recent Latin American immigrants face. Hispanic students showed lower academic achievement, more absences, and more life stressors than their counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Sita G.|last2=Barrera|first2=Alinne Z.|last3=Strambler|first3=Michael J.|last4=Muñoz|first4=Ricardo F.|last5=Macciomei|first5=Erynn|date=2016-04-02|title=The Achievement Gap Among Newcomer Immigrant Adolescents: Life Stressors Hinder Latina/o Academic Success|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15348431.2015.1099529|journal=Journal of Latinos and Education|volume=15|issue=2|pages=121–133|doi=10.1080/15348431.2015.1099529|issn=1534-8431}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014-2015, 77.8% of Hispanic children were [[English-language learner|English Language learners]]. This can be problematic because children may not have parents who speak English at home to help with language acquisition. Immigration struggles can be used as a motivator for students. Immigrant parents appeal to their children and hold high expectations because of the “gift” they are bestowing on them. They immigrated and sacrificed their lives so their children can succeed, and this framework is salient in encouraging children to pursue their education. Parents use their struggles and occupation to encourage a better life.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ceballo|first=Rosario|last2=Maurizi|first2=Laura K.|last3=Suarez|first3=Gloria A.|last4=Aretakis|first4=Maria T.|title=Gift and sacrifice: Parental involvement in Latino adolescents’ education.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0033472|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=116–127|doi=10.1037/a0033472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parent Involvement|Parental involvement]] has been shown to increase educational success and attainment for students. For example, parental involvement in elementary school has been shown to lower high school dropout rates and improved on time completion of high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnard|first=Wendy Miedel|title=Parent involvement in elementary school and educational attainment|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0190740903001178|journal=Children and Youth Services Review|volume=26|issue=1|pages=39–62|doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2003.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common misconception is that Latino parents don’t hold their children's education in high regards (Valencia, 2002), but this has been debunked. Parents show their values in education by holding high academic expectations and giving “consejos” or advice. In 2012, 97% of families reported teaching their children letters, words or numbers.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; A study reported that parent involvement during adolescence continues to be as influential as in early childhood.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

====Motivation gap====
Another explanation that has been suggested for racial and ethnic differences in standardized test performance is that some minority children may not be motivated to do their best on these assessments. Many argue that standardized IQ tests and other testing procedures are culturally biased toward the knowledge and experiences of the European-American middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ronnie-reese/test-bias-minorities_b_2734149.html |title=Minority Testing Bias Persists |last=Reese |first=Ronnie |publisher=''The Huffington Post'' |date=February 21, 2013 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.time.com/2012/10/11/why-its-time-to-get-rid-of-standardized-tests/ |title=Why It's Time to Get Rid of Standardized Tests |last=Rooks |first=Noliwe M. |publisher=''TIME'' |date=October 11, 2012 |accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claude M. Steele suggested that minority children and adolescents may also experience [[stereotype threat]]—the fear that they will be judged to have traits associated with negative appraisals and/or stereotypes of their race or ethnic group. According to this theory, this produces test anxiety and keeps them from doing as well as they could on tests. According to Steele, minority test takers experience anxiety, believing that if they do poorly on their test they will confirm the stereotypes about inferior intellectual performance of their minority group. As a result, a self-fulfilling prophecy begins, and the child performs at a level beneath his or her inherent abilities.

===="Acting white"====
{{Main|Acting white}}

Some researchers&lt;ref name="researchers"&gt;Steele, C., and J. Aronson, “Stereotype Threat and the Test Performance of Academically Successful African Americans” (pp. 401–430), in C. Jencks and M. Phillips (Eds.), The Black-White Test Score Gap (Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; also hypothesize that in some cases, minorities, especially African American students, may stop trying in school because they do not want to be accused of “[[acting white]]” by their peers,&lt;ref&gt;''Black Students' School Success: Coping with the "Burden of 'Acting White'"'' [[Signithia Fordham]] and John U. Ogbu 1986&lt;/ref&gt; or that some minority students simply stop trying because they do not believe they will ever see the true or deserved benefits of their hard work. As some researchers point out, minority students may feel little motivation to do well in school because they do not believe it will pay off in the form of a better job or upward [[social mobility]].&lt;ref name="jencks&amp;phillips"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Black Students' School Success: Coping with the "Burden of 'Acting White'"'' Signithia Fordham and John U. Ogbu 1986&lt;/ref&gt; By not trying to do well in school, such students engage in a rejection of the [[achievement ideology]] &amp;ndash; that is, the idea that working hard and studying long hours will pay off for students in the form of higher wages or upward social mobility.

====Structural and institutional factors====
Different schools have different effects on similar students. Children of color tend to be concentrated in low-achieving, highly segregated schools. In general, minority students are more likely to come from low-income households, meaning minority students are more likely to attend poorly funded schools based on the districting patterns within the school system. Schools in lower-income districts tend to employ less qualified teachers and have fewer educational resources.&lt;ref&gt;''Education and the Inequalities of Place'' Vincent J.Roscigno, Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, and Martha Crowley 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that teacher effectiveness is the most important in-school factor affecting student learning. Good teachers can actually close or eliminate the gaps in achievement on the standardized tests that separate white and minority students.&lt;ref name="teachers"&gt;Gordon, Kane &amp; Staiger (2006). 'Identifying Effective Teachers Using Performance on the Job.' Brookings Institution.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools also tend to place students in [[tracking (education)|tracking]] groups as a means of tailoring lesson plans for different types of learners. However, as a result of schools placing emphasis on socioeconomic status and cultural capital, minority students are vastly over-represented in lower educational tracks.&lt;ref&gt;''Why Do Some Schools Group By Ability?'' Peter G. VanderHart 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Hispanic and African American students are often wrongly placed into lower tracks based on teachers’ and administrators’ expectations for minority students. Such expectations of a race within school systems are a form of [[institutional racism]]. Some researchers compare the tracking system to a modern form of [[racial segregation]] within the schools.&lt;ref&gt;''Detracking: The Social Construction of Ability, Cultural Politics, and Resistance to Reform'' Jeannie Oakes, Amy Stuart Wells, Makeba Jones, and Amanda Datnow 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on tracking groups within schools have also proven to be detrimental for minority students.&lt;ref&gt;''Urban Teachers' Beliefs on Teaching, Learning, and Students: A Pilot Study in the United States of America'' Kim Hyunsook Song 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Once students are in these lower tracks, they tend to have less-qualified teachers, a less challenging curriculum, and few opportunities to advance into higher tracks.&lt;ref&gt;''Social Class in Public Schools'' Jennifer L. Hochschild 2003&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some research that suggests students in lower tracks suffer from social psychological consequences of being labeled as a slower learner, which often leads children to stop trying in school.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In fact, many sociologists argue that tracking in schools does not provide any lasting benefits to any group of students.&lt;ref&gt;''Is Ability Grouping Equitable?'' Adam Gamoran 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of awarding low grades and test scores to children who struggle causes low-performing children to experience anxiety, demoralization, and a loss of control.&lt;ref name="Crooks, Terence J. 1988"&gt;Crooks, Terence J. (1988). The Impact of Classroom Evaluation Practices on Students.

(2017). ''Solving the achievement gap: Overcoming the structure of school inequality.'' New York: Palgrave.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect may explain why the achievement gap has resisted solution.&lt;ref name="Yeh, Stuart S. 2017"/&gt;

====Preschool education====
Additionally, poor and minority students have disproportionately less access to high-quality early childhood education, which has been shown to have a strong impact on early learning and development. One study found that although black children are more likely to attend preschool than white children, they may experience lower-quality care.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Early Childhood Care and Education: Effects on Ethnic and Racial Gaps in School Readiness |first=Katherine A. |last=Magnuson |first2=Jane |last2=Waldfogel |year=2005 |journal=The Future of Children |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=169–196 |jstor=1602667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study also found that Hispanic children in the U.S. are much less likely to attend preschool than white children. Another study conducted in Illinois in 2010&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Fuller, 2010 (referenced in: {{cite web |url=http://www.mccormickfoundation.org/pdf/press%20release%20-%20NJLC%20Illinois%20as%20Trailblazer.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207045158/http://mccormickfoundation.org/PDF/PRESS%20RELEASE%20-%20NJLC%20Illinois%20as%20Trailblazer.pdf |archivedate=December 7, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that only one in three Latino parents could find a preschool slot for his or her child, compared to almost two thirds of other families.

Finally, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER), families with modest incomes (less than $60,000) have the least access to preschool education.&lt;ref&gt;"Who Goes to Preschool and Why Does it Matter?" W. Steven Barnett &amp; Donald J. Yarosz, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that dramatic increases in both enrollment and quality of prekindergarten programs would help to alleviate the school readiness gap and ensure that low-income and minority children begin school on even footing with their peers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Economic implications of the racial achievement gap===
In addition to the moral and social justice arguments for closing the achievement gap, there are [[Racial achievement gap in the United States#Economic outcomes|strong economic arguments for doing so]]. A 2009 report by the management consulting firm [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] asserts that the persistence of the achievement gap in the U.S. has the economic effect of a “permanent national recession."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap on America's Schools |publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company |year=2009 |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/socialsector/achievementgap.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424192005/http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/socialsector/achievementgap.asp |archivedate=April 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report claims that if the achievement gap between black and Latino performance and white student performance had been narrowed, GDP in 2008 would have been $310 billion to $525 billion higher (2–4 percent).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

If the gap between low-income students and their peers had been narrowed, GDP in the same year would have been $400 billion to $670 billion higher (3–5 percent). In addition to the potential increase in GDP, the report projects that closing the achievement gap would lead to cost savings in areas outside of education, such as incarceration and healthcare. The link between low school performance and crime, low earnings and poor health has been echoed in academic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Effect of Education on Crime: Evidence From Prison Inmates, Arrests, and Self-reports |first=L. |last=Lochner |first2=E. |last2=Moretti |year=2004 |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=155–189 |doi=10.1257/000282804322970751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krueger |first=Alan B. |first2=Diane M. |last2=Whitmore |chapter=Would Smaller Classes Help Close the Black-White Achievement Gap? |title=Bridging the Achievement Gap |publisher=The Brookings Institution |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influences of technical difficulties and technology support ===
Students who have problems with technology interfered are more likely to withdraw from their online courses (Bambara et al., 2009)&lt;ref&gt;Bambara, C. S., Harbour, C. P., Davies, T. G., &amp; Athey, S. (2009). Delicate engagement: The lived experience of community college students enrolled in highrisk online courses. Community College Review, 36(3), 219–238. doi:10.1177/0091552108327187 &lt;/ref&gt;. Also, there's no sufficient technology support which will also leads students to drop the class since their problems could not be solved quickly (Palmer &amp; Holt, 2010; Yang &amp; Cornelius, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S., &amp; Holt, D. (2010). Students’ perceptions of the value of the elements of an online learning environment: Looking back in moving forward. Interactive Learning Environments, 18(2), 135–151. doi:10.1080/09539960802364592

Presented at Association for Educational Communications and Technology Annual Meeting 2005. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.learntechlib.org/p/76937/&lt;/nowiki&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influences of technology experience, skills, and self-efficacy ===
Students who were more focused and engaged themselves to the class will tend to receive higher grade, their self-confidence can be gained through daily life use of Internet (Sahin &amp; Shelley, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;Sahin, I., &amp; Shelley, M. (2008). Considering students’ perceptions: The distance education student’s satisfaction model. Journal of Educational Technology and Society, 11(3), 216–223. &lt;/ref&gt;. Male online learners had higher Internet self-efficacy than female, while they participated less in discussions (Chang et al., 2014; Ong &amp; Lai, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Chang, C.S., Liu, E. Z.F., Sung, H.Y., Lin, C. H., Chen, N.S., &amp; Cheng, S.S. (2014). Effects of online college student’s Internet selfefficacy on learning motivation and performance.

=== Factors contributing to onsite academic success for African American males ===
As Fletcher (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, R. P. (2015). Voices of persistence: A case study analysis of African American male community college students participating in a firstyear learning community (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database. (UMI No. 3737723)&lt;/ref&gt; indicated, possible factors that helped African American college students to gain academic success via online education might be: positive pre-college educational experiences, supportive environments in college campus, involving in campus activities, positive faculty interactions and support, same race/gender relationships with peers, family support, self-confidence, future career ambitions and the ability to face racism.

=== African American male online learners as college students ===
Students of color like African American students need a color-blind environment to support them reaching towards academic success better. In this way they are more likely to gain self-confidence and educational resilience (Tucker, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, W. G. (2014). Spaces for success in higher education: Males of color at an online predominantly white community college (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database. (UMI No. 3621155) &lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Attempts at narrowing the racial achievement gap ===
Explanations for the achievement gap and concerns over its effects and even the existence of such a gap are widely contested.  These explanations are also the source of much controversy, especially since efforts to "close the gap" have become some of the more politically prominent education reform issues. The issues that the achievement gap perpetuate also hold politically charged issues. For example, the cause of the Latino education crisis is not attributable to any single factor. It is likely the result of multiple variables-- all of which can have an effect on one another-- ranging from social, economic, and educational conditions to inadequate social services and families with exceptionally low human and social capital. The effects of the achievement gap in school can be seen later in life for students. For example, since schools often lack the resources to meet many students' most basic educational needs and since there are few entry level jobs that provide a living wage and benefits available to those without higher education or special skills in the economy, many are left at a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/17404.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215170642/http://www.nea.org/home/17404.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-02-15|title=NEA - The Crisis in the Education of Latino Students|date=2010-02-15|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following attempts have all been made in order to counteract the effects of the achievement gap at schools. They range from nationwide, government-led initiatives to smaller school-based initiatives.

====Standards-based reform and No Child Left Behind====
The federal [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2002 (NCLB) focuses on standardized test scores and school accountability to ensure that all students have the same educational opportunities. As written, the legislation incentivizes that schools show continual improvement toward this goal (otherwise known as "Adequate Yearly Progress," or AYP) otherwise schools face punishments, such as sanctions. This system has been criticized by some for being unfair toward schools that have the highest population of minority and poor students, as it is harder for these schools to meet the standards set by the No Child Left Behind Act, due to insufficient funding from either local, district, or state actors. This in turn leads to a cycle of underperformance and sanctions within these areas which furthers the problems that the Act meant to fix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html|title=No Child Left Behind Overview: Definitions, Requirements, Criticisms, and More|last=Klein|first=Alyson|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Obama Administration]] instituted the [[Race to the Top]] (RTTT) program which provides financial incentives to states to produce measurable student gains. RTTT's primary goals are to improve student achievement, close achievement gaps, and improve high school graduation rates.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact Sheet: The Race to the Top". The White House. Archived from the original on April 9, 2011. Retrieved April 9,2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of both programs has been to close the achievement gap, but the RTTT has been more focused on closing the gap between higher and lower performing schools rather than focusing on a national approach.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/2010/rpt/2010-R-0235.htm|title=COMPARING NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND AND RACE TO THE TOP|last=Director|first=Judith Lohman, Assistant|website=www.cga.ct.gov|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major difference between the two educational reform programs is that RTTT is a competitive grant program that provides incentives for schools to change, while the NCLB Act mandated various changes in state and local education systems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The RTTT's approach is more adaptable and focused as it allows for individual actions between schools, and is meant to encourage reform within schools without resorting to punishments, whereas the No Child Left Behind Act relies on punishments as its main form of promoting reform in schools.

Another attempt to standardize the education of students is the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]], also known as Common Core. The Common Core, created in 2009 and 2010, sets benchmarks for the skills that students should have by certain grade levels in subjects such as Math and Language Arts and the system itself is to meant to be a national baseline for how students are achieving. This baseline is meant to help establish what students need in order to achieve in higher education.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/cards/commoncore/3-what-problems-is-the-common-core-trying-to-solve|title=What problems is the Common Core trying to solve?|date=2014-03-26|work=Vox|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the standards are meant to be nationwide, they have only been adopted by 35 states as it is not mandatory for states to subscribe to the Common Core unless they desire federal grants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/map-states-academic-standards-common-core-or.html|title=Map: Tracking the Common Core State Standards|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Common Core Initiative has been criticized as it has not yielded any noticeable improvement in what has almost 10 years since it has been implemented, due to a multiple reasons, from incorrect implementation to content as the idea of a centralized system for education has been criticized for not taking the dynamic differences in learning-style into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nealmccluskey/2018/10/18/common-core-doesnt-seem-to-be-working-that-may-be-just-fine/#1b9d5bbb6993|title=Common Core Doesn't Seem To Be Working; That May Be Just Fine|last=McCluskey|first=Neal|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newest addition to the growing list of government-led initiatives has been the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], or ESSA. The ESSA, enacted in December 2015, is Congress's replacement for the NCLB. The ESSA takes notes from both the RTTT and the NCLB, by keeping the standardized testing of the NCLB while allowing for the flexibility of the RTTT. The ESSA gives states more say in how schools are held accountable, and how states can act to fix issues at their schools, and as such, states can set long-term goals instead of having to worry about year-to-year performance issues as with the NCLB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/every-student-succeeds-act/index.html|title=The Every Student Succeeds Act: An ESSA Overview|last=Klein|first=Alyson|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; States must still identify low performing schools and provide additional support, but now states can focus on long-term solutions. The new bill also focuses more on academic growth, which is subjective and does not always line up with a student's grade level, whereas the NCLB only cared whether students were performing to grade level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://educationpost.org/the-abcs-of-esea-essa-and-no-child-left-behind/|title=The ABC’s of ESEA, ESSA and No Child Left Behind - Education Post|work=Education Post|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; By combining the standardized test requirements of the NCLB while allowing for more state control like in the RTTT, the ESSA hopes to achieve long-lasting success and reform.

====School-based reform====
Initiatives to close the achievement gap have been implemented at the school, district and state level in order to better address the issue. These include investments in pre-kindergarten programs, class size reduction, small schools, curricular reform, alignment of pre-kindergarten through college standards and expectations, and improved teacher education programs.&lt;ref&gt;"Bridging the Achievement Gap" John E. Chubb &amp; Tom Loveless, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Many schools have started implementing [[After-school activity|after-school activities]] such as tutoring sessions, remedial programs, and rapid assessment programs. These programs are meant to help minority students learn at a more accelerated rate in order to help them catch up to their peers. Other schools have started de-tracking their students in order to provide the same quality education for all students, regardless of race. De-tracking not only allows for all students to be taught in the same way, but it also opens up new opportunities for students who would be put on a certain career path by their education.

====Teacher-focused reform====
Another focus of reform directed toward the achievement gap has been on teacher development, as research shows that since teachers are responsible for almost every aspect of a child's education within the bounds of a classroom. Therefore, in order to best address the achievement gap, reform efforts based on improved teaching are one of the main strategies used to address the gap. This reform effort has been both top-down, in the form of higher state standards for teacher education and preparation,&lt;ref&gt;"Doing What Matters Most: Investing in Quality Teaching" Linda Darling-Hammond(prepared for the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as bottom-up, through programs like Teach for America and AmeriCorps that aim to address educational inequity by recruiting and training teachers specifically to work in high-needs schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teach for America: Our Approach|url=http://www.teachforamerica.org/what-we-do/our-approach/|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Way Public Schools AmeriCorps team|url=http://www.fwps.org/dept/volunteer/acfw.html|accessdate=October 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419162328/http://www.fwps.org/dept/volunteer/acfw.html|archive-date=April 19, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Investment in early childhood====
One strategy being used to address the achievement gap has been focusing on early childhood development. Economic research shows that investment at this stage is both more effective and cost effective than interventions later in a child's life.&lt;ref&gt;"Investments in Early Childhood as a Means for Deficit Reduction" James Heckman, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; By helping develop critical skills early on, these programs cut out the need for such intervention later on. Head Start and various state-funded pre-kindergarten programs target students from low-income families in an attempt to level the playing field for these children before school begins. In addition to increased access, there has also an increased national focus on raising quality standards for Head Start and state-funded pre-K programs, and in improving training and professional development for early care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Changing Landscape of Pre-K: Examining the changes and impacts of quality standards in prekindergarten at the national, state, district and program levels|url=http://www.nieer.org|accessdate=April 13, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110417172816/http://nieer.org/| archivedate=April 17, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is substantial evidence pointing to early childhood development playing a huge role in closing the achievement gap: various studies, including the Carolina Abecedarian study, Child-Parent Center study, and HighScope Perry Preschool study, have shown that pre-K programs can have a positive and long-lasting impact on academic achievement of low-income and minority students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=F.

Pre-K programs help students develop social, emotional, and critical thinking skills at a young age, and while none of this prevents the effects of poverty, it does help in dampening the effects while also better preparing student for their future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/05/03/524907739/pre-k-decades-worth-of-studies-one-strong-message|title=Pre-K: Decades Worth Of Studies, One Strong Message|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effects of narrowing the racial achievement gap====
Sociologists [[Christopher Jencks]] and Meredith Phillips have argued that narrowing the black-white test score gap "would do more to move [the United States] toward racial equality than any politically plausible alternative".&lt;ref name="jencks&amp;phillips"/&gt; As already discussed, there is also strong evidence that narrowing the gap would have a significant positive economic and social impact.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yeh, Stuart S. (2009). Shifting the Bell Curve: The Benefits and Costs of Raising Student Achievement. Evaluation and Program Planning, 32(1), 74-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Narrowing the achievement gap through technology====

Computer and technology use have been linked to increased student achievement. “When teachers and administrators make a sustained commitment to the use of [[computers in the classroom]], student achievement increases (Mann &amp; Shafer, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mann |first=D. |last2=Shafer |first2=E. |year=1997 |title=Technology and Achievement |journal=The American School Board Journal |url=http://www.asbj.com/achievement/cilcilo.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randomized experiments demonstrate that the performance of low-achieving students can be improved by using technology that adjusts the level of difficulty of the books and math problems that are presented to each student, raises the probability that each student will achieve high scores on end-of-book reading comprehension quizzes and high accuracy scores on daily math assignments, raises the probability that each student can earn high letter grades, and creates a structured environment where each student is likely to receive regular, objective, positive feedback signaling that he or she is advancing on a daily basis, promoting high self-efficacy and a strong sense of control over academic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ysseldyke |first=Jim |last2=Bolt |first2=Daniel M. |year=2007 |title=Effect of Technology-Enhanced Continuous Progress Monitoring on Math Achievement |journal=School Psychology Review |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=453–467 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Steven M., Nunnery, John, &amp; Goldfeder, Elizabeth (2004).

New York, NY: Picador. &lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the world is flat, online education has made the education becomes more accessible for a wider range of students. But there's also some counter points of online education for example: lack of technical support (Palmer &amp; Holt, 2010; Yang &amp; Cornelius, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S., &amp; Holt, D. (2010). Students’ perceptions of the value of the elements of an online learning environment: Looking back in moving forward.

Using technology as a tool for narrowing the achievement gap begins with a purpose, communication, listening, and collaboration. These skills can be achieved through the use of weblogs, social networking sites, feeds, and myriad other multimedia. In classrooms, students can communicate internally, or they can work side by side with others who are located thousands of miles away. Through the use of technology, presentations can be archived so that the material can be reviewed at any time. “All teachers could record important parts of what they do in the classroom that can then be archived to the class Weblog and used by students who may have missed the class or just want a refresher on what happened.” (Richardson, p.&amp;nbsp;117)&lt;ref name="Richardson, W. 2010"&gt;Richardson, W. (2010), Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts, and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms&lt;/ref&gt;

Having access to information on the web gives students an advantage to learning. “Students at all levels show more interest in their work and their ability to locate and reflect upon their work is greatly enhanced as are the opportunities for collaborative learning” (Richardson, p.&amp;nbsp;28).&lt;ref name="Richardson, W. 2010"/&gt; Weblogs are different from posts or comments; they require students to analyze and synthesize the content and communicate their understanding with the audience responses in mind. 
 
Technology has been incorporated into the Standards. Even though the NCLB Act holds school districts accountable for student achievement, there are still many students who do not have the resources at home to fully take part in these excellent educational tools. Some teachers feel that technology is not the solution and see it as a risk. Therefore, technology is not always being used to its fullest potential by teachers and students do not gain the advantages technology offers. “Given the fact that the amount of information going online shows no sign of slowing, if they are unable to consistently collect potentially relevant information for their lives and careers and quickly discern what of that information is most useful, they will be at a disadvantage.” (Richardson, p.&amp;nbsp;73).&lt;ref name="Richardson, W. 2010"/&gt;

According to the U.S. Census, by 2012, it is estimated that 70% of homes will have broadband access. While this is a large percentage, it still leaves 30% of households without internet access. The government has lent its hand in closing the Global Achievement Gap by granting funding for low-income school districts for programs such as one-on-one computing, however, the fact that many of these students do not have online capability at home is still a main issue. This [[digital divide]] may cause the achievement gap to increase as technology continues to become heavily integrated in the daily coursework for school children. Students need to have Internet access outside of school on a regular basis to successfully complete challenging courswork.

According to National Center for Education Statistics, it noted that African American 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade male students had the lowest reading scores among other racial and ethnic group. Reading gaps between African Americans and Whites have increased from 1992 to present (National Center for Education Statistics, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics. (2016). Educational attainment of young adults, 2016. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=27&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Tonsing-Meyer (2013)&lt;ref&gt;TonsingMeyer, J. (2013). An examination of online instructional practices based on the learning styles of graduate education students. The Quarterly Review of Distance Education, 14(3), 141–149. &lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the reading and writing practice was specified and emphasized in 85% of online course assignment, with activities attached, which might improve this situation.

===High-performing high-poverty and high-minority schools===
Exceptions to the achievement gap exist. Schools that are majority black, even poor, can perform well above national norms, with [[John S. Davidson Fine Arts Magnet School|Davidson Magnet School]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} in [[Augusta, Georgia]] being a prominent example. Another school with remarkable gains for students of color is Amistad Academy in New Haven, Connecticut.Additionally North Star Academy has been awarded the National Blue Ribbon School for two years in a row. These schools offer more rigorous, traditional modes of instruction, including [[Direct Instruction]]. In one study, Direct Instruction was found to be the single most effective pedagogical method for raising the skill levels of inner-city students (Project Follow Through).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/15sept97/hu091597.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

High performing Black schools are not unique to the twentieth century. In Washington, DC in the late 19th century, a predominantly low income Black school performed higher than three White schools in yearly testing. This trend continued until the mid 20th century, and during that time the M Street School exceeded national norms on standardized tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsowell.com/speducat.html|title=Thomas Sowell - "The Education of Minority Children"|first=Na|last=Liu|website=www.tsowell.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans lagged behind whites in 2000 by nearly a factor of two. However, it is less frequently observed{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} that whites lag behind Asians by nearly as large a ratio. The group with the least education is not the African Americans, but the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], [[Hispanic]] or [[Latino]] or other groups who have quite a different legacy of discrimination.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The African-American community is behind the curve in education but statistics show 9 out of 10 young black adults ages 25 to 29 have completed high school or its equivalent.

In 2008, over three million degrees were awarded throughout the United States. Half of all degrees earned were [[bachelor's degrees]]. The bachelor's degree is one of the most awarded degrees for all ethnicities and races. Asians obtained bachelor's degrees more than any other race, followed by Whites. Despite high educational expectations, Hispanics are among the least educated group in the United States: 11 percent of those over age 25 have earned a bachelor's degree or higher compared with 17 percent of blacks, 30 percent of whites, and 49 percent of Asian Americans in the same age group (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003).&lt;ref name="Schhneider"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Barriers to Educational Opportunities for Hispanics in the United States|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19909/|date = 2006-01-01|first = Barbara|last = Schhneider|first2 = Sylvia|last2 = Martinez|first3 = Ann|last3 = Ownes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asians obtain more [[first professional degree]]s than any other race. A high percentage{{Clarify|date=September 2012}} of Hispanics and American Indians/Alaska Natives own an [[associate's degree]] compared with other races. About 1–2% [[doctorate degree]]s are awarded to all races. The table below shows the number of degrees awarded for each group.

=== College and university enrollment ===

Between 1978 and 2008, college enrollment rates increased for all races. The college enrollment rate is determined by the percentage of high school students who enroll in two-year or four-year college and universities immediately after high school. In 2008, the college enrollment rate for all races was 69%. Although the college rate increased for each racial and ethnic group between 1980 and 2007, the enrollment rates for [[Black people|Blacks]] and [[Hispanics]] did not increase, and the college enrollment rate for Blacks increased from 44% to 56%.{{clarification needed|date=June 2018|It did increase, but it didn't, but it did?}} Between 1980 and 2007, the college enrollment rates for Hispanics have increased from 50% to 62%. In comparison, the same rate increased from 49.8% to 77.7% for Whites. There are no data for Asians or American Indians/Alaska Natives regarding enrollment rates from the 1980s to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2010/2010015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the enrollment rate of high school graduates reached a historical high of 70.1% (see above for statistics on the racial gap in graduation rates). Asian Americans have the highest enrollment rate (92.2%), followed by Whites (69.2%), Blacks (68.7%), and Hispanics (59.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/college-enrollment-rate-at-record-high/ | work=The New York Times | first=Catherine | last=Rampell | title=College Enrollment Rate at Record High | date=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parenting influence ===

Parenting methods are different across cultures, thus can have dramatic influence on educational outcomes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} For instance, Asian parents often apply strict rules and parental authoritarianism to their children while many white American parents deem creativity and self-sufficiency to be more valuable.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} ''[[Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother]]'' by Yale Professor Amy Chua highlights some of the very important aspects in Asian parenting method in comparison to the “American way”. Chua's book has generated interests and controversies in the “Tiger Mom” parenting method and its role in determining children's education outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tiger Moms: Is Tough Parenting Really the Answer?|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2043477,00.html|publisher=Time Magazine | date=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hispanic parents and their children believe that a college degree is necessary for obtaining stable and meaningful work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ambitious Generation: America's Teenagers, Motivated but Directionless.|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED430176|publisher = Yale University Press |isbn = 0-300-07982-6|first = Barbara|last = Schneider|first2 = David|last2 = Stevenson}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude is reflected in the educational expectations parents hold for their children and in the expectations that young people have for themselves (U.S. Department of Education, 1995b, p.&amp;nbsp;88).&lt;ref name="Schhneider"/&gt; High educational expectations can be found among all racial and ethnic groups regardless of their economic and social resources (p.&amp;nbsp;73). Although parents and children share high educational aims, their aspirations do not necessarily translate into postsecondary matriculation. This is especially the case for Hispanic high school students, particularly those whose parents have not attended college.&lt;ref&gt;Nuñez, Cuccaro-Alamin, and Carroll, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/98082.pdf |title = National Center for Education Statistics|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

School administrators must accommodate and account for family differences and also be supportive by promoting ways families can get involved. For example, schools can provide support by accommodating the needs of the family who have do not have transportation, schools may do so by providing external resources that may benefit the family.&lt;ref&gt;Flakes, B.

Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/304722541&lt;/ref&gt; As referenced by Feliciano et al. (2016), educators can also account for culture by providing education about the diversity at the school. This can be achieved by creating an environment where both teachers and students learn about cultures represented among the student population.

Larocquem et al. (2011) stated that family involvement may include visiting their children's class, being involved with a parent teacher organization, attending school activities, speaking to the child's class, and volunteering at school events. It is also important for families to be involved with the child's school assignments, especially by holding them accountable for completion and discussion of the work assigned.&lt;ref name="LaRocque, M. 2011"/&gt; Also, educators may want to consider how parental language barriers and educational experiences affect families and the influence of contributing to their child's education.&lt;ref name="brown.edu"/&gt; In addition, even when families want to get involved, they may not know how to collaborate with school personnel, especially for families who are Hispanic, African American, and or of low economic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barton |first=A.

=== Illiteracy ===

African Americans were once denied educations. Even as late as 1947, about one third of African Americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names. However, by 1969, [[illiteracy]] as it had been traditionally defined, had been largely eradicated among African Americans—the number of among young adults was less than one percent, though African Americans still lag in more stringent definitions of document literacy.&lt;!-- see table below --&gt; Inability to read, write or speak English in America today is largely an issue for immigrants, mostly from Asia and [[Latin America]].

=== Immigrants ===
Educational attainment rates change when it comes to comparing the same races against immigrants or foreign born students. Black African and Caribbean immigrant groups to the U.S report having higher levels of education than any other group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uwec.edu/geography/ivogeler/w188/datarace.htm |title=U.S. Population: Ethnicity, Race, Gender, Income |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214090723/http://www.uwec.edu/geography/ivogeler/w188/datarace.htm |archivedate=December 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2018}} Of all foreign-born U.S. residents, foreign born Africans (those who come from the African continent) nowadays{{when|date=April 2018}} have a higher level of educational attainment than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://racerelations.about.com/od/diversitymatters/a/DoesAffirmativeActionAddressIntraRacialDivides.htm|title=Ethnicities Eligible for College Affirmative Action|author=Nadra Kareem Nittle|work=About.com News &amp; Issues|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aracorporation.org"&gt;{{cite journal |title=African-Born U.S. Residents are the Most Highly Educated Group in American Society |journal=Journal of Blacks in Higher Education |volume=13 |year=1996 |pages=33–34 |doi=10.2307/2963153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be highly educated and be fluent in English.

US Census surveys showed that by 1998, 89 percent of African Americans age 25 to 29 had completed high school, lagging only slightly behind 93 percent for whites. For all over the age of 25, clear majorities of whites, Asian Americans and African Americans had graduated at 88 percent, 85 percent and 77 percent, respectively. 56 percent, or barely over half of Hispanics 25 and over, had completed high school.

Source: 1995 College Board SAT Profiles&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurhu.com/index/test.htm#satincome] Hu's Index of Diversity&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative African American scholars such as [[Thomas Sowell]] observe that while SAT scores are lower for students with less parental education and income. Asian Americans who took the SAT with incomes below $10,000 score 482 in math in 1995, comparable to whites earning $30–40,000 and higher and blacks over $70,000. Test scores in middle-income black communities, such as [[Prince George County]], are still not comparable to those in non-black suburbs.

=== State standards ===

Most state tests showing African American failure rates anywhere from two to four times the rate of whites, such as Washington State's [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] test, and only half to one-quarter as likely to achieve a high score, even though these tests were designed to eliminate the negative effects of bias associated with standardized multiple choice tests. It is a top goal of education reform to eliminate the ''[[Education gap]]'' between all races, though skeptics question whether legislation such as [[No Child Left Behind]] truly closes the gap just by raising expectations. Others, such as [[Alfie Kohn]], observe it may merely penalize those who do not score as well as the most educated ethnic and income groups.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |first=Charles |last=Murray |title=Acid Tests |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=July 25, 2006 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115379210632316123 }} He claims NCLB punishes minority students and does not close basic skill differences.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===

The amount of education completed varies greatly between members of religions in the United States. Hindus and Jews, for example, are more likely than general population to have completed a college education, whereas members of Evangelical churches, historically Black Protestant churches and Jehovah's Witness are less likely (21%, 15% and 12% respectively).&lt;ref name="pew2014"&gt;{{cite web |author=Pew Research Center |date=12 May 2015 |url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/05/RLS-05-08-full-report.pdf |title=America's Changing Religious Landscape |publisher=The Pew Forum |accessdate=20 May 2015 |page=56 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082110/http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/05/RLS-05-08-full-report.pdf |archivedate=May 18, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International comparisons ===

{{TIMSSMathScores2007}}

As a whole, students in the United States lagged the best Asian and European nations in the [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMSS international math and science test]]. However, broken down by race, US Asians scored comparably to Asian nations, white Americans scored comparably to the best European nations. Although some racial generally score lower than whites in the US, they scored as well as whites in other European nations. Hispanic Americans averaged 505, comparable to students Austria and Sweden, while African Americans at 482 were comparable to Norway and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/2008/12/24/odds-and-ends-alternative-energy-czar-2/|title=Odds and Ends|publisher=|accessdate=May 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404215401/http://www.asianweek.com/2008/12/24/odds-and-ends-alternative-energy-czar-2/|archive-date=April 4, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Special programs ===

Achievement gaps among students may also manifest themselves in the racial and ethnic composition of [[special education]] and [[gifted education]] programs. Typically, African American and Hispanic students are enrolled in greater numbers in special education programs than their numbers would indicate in most populations, while these groups are underrepresented in gifted programs.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, R.

==Gender achievement gap in the United States==
{{see also|Sex and intelligence}}
For the past fifty years, there has been a gap in the educational achievement of males and females in the United States, but which gender has been disadvantaged has fluctuated over the years. In the 1970s and 1980s, data showed girls trailing behind boys in a variety of academic performance measures, specifically in test scores in math and science.&lt;ref name="Kafer"/&gt;

Data in the last twenty years shows the general trend of girls outperforming boys in academic achievement in terms of class grades across all subjects and college graduation rates, but boys scoring higher on standardized tests and being better represented in the higher-paying and more prestigious [[STEM fields]] (science, technology, engineering, and math).&lt;ref name="Kafer"&gt;Kafir, Krista (April 2007). "Taking the Boy Crisis in Education Seriously: How School Choice can Boost Achievement Among Boys and Girls." Independent Women's Forum.&lt;/ref&gt; Male students consistently achieved worse school marks than female students from 1913 to 2011 in all countries for which there is data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daniel |last=Voyer |first2=Susan D. |last2=Voyer |title=Gender Differences in Scholastic Achievement: A Meta-Analysis |journal=Psychological Bulletin |year=2014 |volume=140 |issue=4 |page=1194 |url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-a0036620.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Fletcher (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, R. P. (2015). Voices of persistence: A case study analysis of African American male community college students participating in a firstyear learning community (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database. (UMI No. 3737723) &lt;/ref&gt; indicated, possible factors that helped African American college students to gain academic success via online education might be: positive pre-college educational experiences, supportive environments in college campus, involving in campus activities, positive faculty interactions and support, same race/gender relationships with peers, family support, self-confidence, future career ambitions and the ability to face racism.Students of color like African American students need a color-blind environment to support them reaching towards academic success better. In this way they are more likely to gain self-confidence and educational resilience (Tucker, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, W. G. (2014).

===Gender gap in literacy===

[[File:Differences in Average Scale Scores for Girls and Boys.jpg|thumb|450px|Achievement gaps between boys and girls in the United States are more pronounced in reading and writing than in math and science.]]

Traditionally, girls have outperformed boys in reading and writing. Although this gap may be minimal in kindergarten, it grows as students continue their education. According to the 2004 National Reading Assessment measured by the [[US Department of Education]], the gap between boys and girls, only slightly noticeable in 4th grade, left boys 14 points behind girls during their 12th grade year.&lt;ref name="Perie"&gt;Perie, M. (2005). NAEP 2004 Trends in Academic Progress. Washington, DC: US Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; On the 2008 test, female students continued to have higher average reading scores than male students at all three ages. The gap between male and female 4th graders was 7 points in 2008. By 12th grade, there was an 11-point gap between males and females.&lt;ref name="Perie"/&gt;

On the 2002 National Writing Assessment, boys scored on average 17 points lower than girls in 4th grade. The average gap increased to 21 points by 8th grade and widened to 24 points by senior year in high school.&lt;ref name="Persky"&gt;Persky, H. (2003). The Nation's Report Card: Writing 2002. US Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; In the more recent 2007 National Assessment of Writing Skills, female students continued to score higher than male students, though margins closed slightly from previous assessments. The average score for female eighth-graders was 20 points higher than males, down 1 point from the 2002 score. For twelfth-graders, females outscored males by 18 points as opposed to 21 points in 2002.&lt;ref name="Salahu"&gt;Salahu-Din, Debra (2008). The Nation's Report Card: Writing 2007. US Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these assessments were conducted on a 100-point scale.&lt;ref name="Perie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Persky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salahu"/&gt;

===Gender gap in math and science===

Which gender is disadvantaged by the gap in math and science achievement largely depends on how academic achievement is being measured. Female students generally have better grades in their math classes, and this gap starts off very minimal but increases with age.&lt;ref name="Dee2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dee |first=T. |year=2007 |title=Teachers and the gender gaps in student achievement |journal=Journal of Human Resources |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.3368/jhr.XLII.3.528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adeleke |first=M. |year=2007 |title=Gender disparity in mathematical performance revisited: can training in problem solving bring difference between boys and girls? |work=Essays in Education |volume=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, males score higher on standardized math tests, and these score gaps also increase with age. Male students also score higher on measures of college readiness, such as the AP Calculus exams and the math section of the SAT.&lt;ref&gt;Amelink, C. (2009). Information sheet: gender differences in math performance . Assessing Women in Engineering, 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences in National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP) math scores between boys and girls nearly double from the 9-year-olds to the 17-year-olds.&lt;ref name="Dee2007" /&gt; This inconsistency in which gender shows more achievement could be due to the fact that class grades, especially in middle and high school, usually depend on a student's completion of homework assignments, and studies have shown that girls report spending more time on homework than boys.&lt;ref&gt;Lubienski, S. T., McGraw, R., &amp; [[Marilyn Strutchens|Strutchens, M.]] (2004). NAEP findings regarding gender: Mathematics achievement, student affect, and learning practices. In P. Kloosterman, &amp; F. K. Lester Jr. (Eds.), Results and interpretations of the 1990 through 2000 mathematics assessments of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (pp. 305–336). Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt; The gender gap in mathematics is particularly large among the highest-achieving students; for example, there is a 2.1 to 1 male-female ratio among students who score an 800 on the math portion of the SAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=CollegeBoard.com |year=2010 |title=SAT Percentile Rank or Males, Females, and Total Group, 2007 College-Bound Seniors—Mathematics |others=A table |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/highered/ra/sat/SAT_percentile_ranks_males_females_total_group_mathematics.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one study has challenged the existence of the gender gap in mathematics. In 2008 Janet Hyde and others published a study showing that male and female students did equally well on [[No Child Left Behind]] standardized tests that were administered in second through eleventh grades in ten states. However, Hyde and her team did find gaps that favored males at the upper end of the achievement distribution and tried to examine gaps on more difficult test questions (previous research has shown that males outperform females on more challenging items), but the tests they examined lacked adequately challenging items. This raised questions about whether there is still a gender gap in math achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hyde |first=J. S. |last2=Lindberg |first2=S. M. |last3=Linn |first3=M. C. |last4=Ellis |first4=A. B. |last5=Williams |first5=C.

There is also a large discrepancy between the number of men and women working in STEM fields. Women have been, and continue to be, underrepresented in these fields. This underrepresentation is evident in the distribution of college majors among men and women; from 1997 to 2007, women earned only 18% of engineering bachelor's degrees.&lt;ref name="Dey"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dey |first=J. G. |last2=Hill |first2=C. |year=2007 |title=Beyond the Pay Gap |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Association of University Women Educational Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender gap in graduation rates===

According to recent data, 55 percent of college students are females and 45 percent are males. From 1995 until 2005, the number of males enrolled in college increased by 18 percent, while the number of female students rose by 27 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Digest of Education Statistics 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Males are enrolling in college in greater numbers than ever before, yet fewer than two-thirds of them are graduating with a bachelor's degree.

===Gender gap in lifetime earnings===
{{see also|Gender pay gap}}
Although more women are graduating with undergraduate degrees, men are still earning disproportionately more in their lifetimes. This could be due to many factors, including different types of jobs for males and females. Females are greatly underrepresented in science and engineering fields, which are typically correlated with high lifetime earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bedard |first=Kelly |first2=Insook |last2=Cho |year=2010 |title=Early gender test score gaps across OECD countries |journal=Economics of Education Review |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=348–363 |doi=10.1016/j.econedurev.2009.10.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Males and females also have vastly different labor market histories based on type of job and time spent in each job.&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt;

==Possible causes of the gender achievement gap in the United States==

===Teacher interactions===

How a student interacts with and is evaluated by his or her teachers is closely correlated with that student's future academic achievement.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} According to researcher Thomas Good, there are two competing views of how teachers can indirectly impact the achievement of their students. The first is that teachers are more likely to give special attention and extra assistance to students who appear to be struggling in their class. In reading and writing classes, male students are often behind female students in terms of achievement. Therefore, male students are more likely to get more teacher attention, and this extra interaction could give males an advantage in terms of future achievement. The second view is that teachers demand more and show more respect toward students who they view to be high achievers, which creates a cycle in which only students who are perceived to be intelligent receive extra help and teacher attention.&lt;ref name="Good"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Good |first=T. L. |year=1987 |title=Two decades of research on teacher expectations: Findings and future directions |journal=Journal of Teacher Education |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=32–47 |doi=10.1177/002248718703800406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teacher evaluations===

How teachers perceive students’ knowledge and abilities varies by gender and influences classroom processes and student achievement in both reading and math. Teachers usually have higher expectations for students they view as higher achievers and treat these students with more respect.&lt;ref name="Good"/&gt; A study by Tach and Farkas has also found that when students are split into reading groups based on their abilities, the students in the higher-ability reading groups are more likely to demonstrate positive learning behaviors and higher achievement.&lt;ref name="Tach"/&gt;

Teachers are more likely to favor girls when evaluating what types of readers students seem to be. Because studies have shown that teacher perceptions of students can determine how much individualized attention a student receives and can serve as an indicator of future academic progress, if teachers underestimate males’ reading abilities and use ability grouping in their classrooms, male students might be put at a disadvantage and have their learning in reading classes be negatively affected.&lt;ref name="Tach"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tach |first=L. M. |last2=Farkas |first2=G. |year=2006 |title=Learning-related behaviors, cognitive skills, and ability grouping when schooling begins |journal=Social Science Research |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=1048–1079 |doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2005.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nigro, G., M. Tappan, and S. Desrochers. (2008). The gender divide in academic engagement: Perspectives from Maine boys and young men. Report presented at the annual meeting of the Maine Boys Network conference, Bates College, Lewiston, ME.&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite trend has been found in math classes. Teachers still tend to view math as a “masculine” subject and tend to have higher expectations for and better attitude towards their male students in these classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Li |first=Q. |year=1999 |title=Teachers’ beliefs and gender differences in mathematics: A review |journal=Educational Research |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=63–76 |doi=10.1080/0013188990410106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Fennema et al. has also shown that teachers tend to name males when asked to list their “best math students.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fennema |first=E. |last2=Peterson |first2=P. L. |last3=Carpenter |first3=T. P. |last4=Lubinski |first4=C. |year=1990 |title=Teachers’ attributions and beliefs about girls, boys, and mathematics |journal=Educational Studies in Mathematics |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=55–69 |doi=10.1007/BF00311015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Females are more likely than males to be negatively impacted than male students by this underestimation of their math abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKown |first=C. |last2=Weinstein |first2=R. S. |year=2002 |title=Modeling the role of child ethnicity and gender in children’s differential response to teacher expectations |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=159–184 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb01425.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; These gender-specific evaluations from teachers are implicit; usually the teachers have no idea that they are favoring one gender over the other until they are shown concrete evidence, such as a video recording of their classroom. However, even though the discrimination is implicit, it still has negative effects on both male and female students.&lt;ref name="Good"/&gt;

There is conflicting evidence about whether teacher assessments of student performance and ability are consistent with cognitive assessments like standardized tests. Teacher assessment evidence comes from a relatively small number of classrooms when compared to standardized tests, which are administered in every public school in all fifty states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=Joseph Paul |first2=Sarah Theule |last2=Lubienski |year=2010 |title=The Development of Gender Achievement Gaps in Mathematics and Reading During Elementary and Middle School: Examining Direct Cognitive Assessments and Teacher Ratings |journal=American Education Research Journal |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=268–302 |doi=10.3102/0002831210372249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stereotyping===
{{see also|Stereotype threat}}
There is speculation that gender stereotyping within classrooms can also lead to differences in academic achievement and representation for female and male students. Math and science are often perceived as “masculine” subjects because they lead to success in “masculine” fields, such as medicine and engineering. English and history, on the other hand, are often perceived as “feminine” subjects because they are more closely aligned with “feminine” jobs, such as teaching or care work. These stereotypes can influence student achievement in these areas.&lt;ref name="Ellison"/&gt;

Research on [[stereotype threat]] has shown that gender stereotypes decrease the mathematical self-esteem of many female students, and that this lack of academic confidence leads to anxiety and poorer performance on math exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Amelink |first=C. |year=2009 |title=Information sheet: gender differences in math performance |work=Assessing Women in Engineering |volume=1–4 |url=https://www.engr.psu.edu/AWE/misc/ARPs/ARP_InfoSheet_Math.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parent socialization===

How a child's parents view his or her skills can also contribute to the gender achievement gap in education. A study by Jacobs and Eccles has shown that adults rate female children as having better social skills than male children, and that girls are more likely to be seen as "good children" than boys.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"/&gt; These gender-based stereotypes can perpetuate the gender achievement gap in education by influencing parents' perceptions of their children's skills, and these perceptions can influence the types of activities and subjects parents steer their children toward.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacobs |first=Janis E. |first2=Jacquelynne S. |last2=Eccles |year=1992 |title=The Impact of Mothers' Gender-Role Stereotypic Beliefs on Mothers' and Children's Ability Perceptions |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=932–944 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.6.932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socio-economic factors === 
The gender achievement gap, measured by standardized test scores, suspensions, and absences, in favor of female students, is larger at worse schools and among lower-income households. So poverty and school quality are partially responsible for the gap. &lt;ref&gt;Guo, Jeff. "The serious reason boys do worse than girls." The Washington Post. January 28, 2016. https://archive.today/20180722233207/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/28/the-serious-reason-boys-do-worse-than-girls/?utm_term=.4f067a226d42&amp;noredirect=on&lt;/ref&gt;

=== self-regulation and conscientiousness. === 
Girls tend to have better self-regulation skills than boys. Self-regulation skills correlate with time spent on homework and time spent taking notes in class. This contributes to girls getting better grades than boys in all subject. &lt;ref&gt;GNAULATI, ENRICO. "Why Girls Tend to Get Better Grades Than Boys Do." The Atlantic. SEP 18, 2014. https://archive.today/20170328190455/https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/09/why-girls-get-better-grades-than-boys-do/380318/#selection-1251.0-1251.12.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Sex differences in psychology]]

==Implications of the gender gap==

It is important to address the gender achievement gap in education because failure to cultivate the academic talents of any one group will have aggregate negative consequences. If women are underrepresented in STEM fields, and if men are underrepresented in the social sciences and humanities, both genders are missing opportunities to develop diverse skill sets that can help them in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Ellison"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ellison |first=Glenn |first2=Ashley |last2=Swanson |year=2010 |title=The Gender Gap in Secondary School Mathematics at High Achievement Levels: Evidence from the American Mathematics Competitions |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=109–128 |doi=10.1257/jep.24.2.109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the gender achievement gap in education continues to exist, so does the stereotype that medicine, science, and engineering are all “masculine” fields and that women belong in fields like teaching, counseling, or social work. This stereotype can lead to the image that women who pursue careers in the STEM fields are seen as “nerdy” or “geeky,” and this can have a detrimental effect on the self-esteem of females who do choose to enter these fields.&lt;ref name="Ellison"/&gt;

Researchers have found that the gender achievement gap has a large impact on the future career choices of high-achieving students. Part of this is a result of the college majors that men and women choose; men are more likely to major in engineering or the hard sciences, while women are more likely to receive degrees in English, psychology, or sociology. Therefore, men are statistically more likely to enter careers that have more potential for higher long-term earnings than women.&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt;

The careers that are aligned with these majors have different levels of prestige and different salaries, which can lead to a [[Gender pay gap|gender wage gap]]. U.S. Census data indicates that women who work full-time earn only 77% of what their male counterparts earn. For men and women who are ten years out of college, women earn only 69% of the salaries of their male workers.&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt;

==Attempts to reduce the gender gap==

There have been several studies done of interventions aimed at reducing the gender achievement gap in science classes. Some interventions, such as instituting mentoring programs aimed at women or restructuring the course curriculum, have had limited success. The most successful interventions have been a form of psychological interventions called values affirmation. In a famous study of women's achievement in college science by Miyake et al., values affirmation was successful in reducing the differences between male and female academic achievement in college-level introductory physics classes, and it has been particularly effective at combating the psychological phenomenon known as [[stereotype threat]].&lt;ref name="Miyake"/&gt;

Values affirmation exercises require students to either write about their most important values or their least important values two times at the beginning of the 15-week course. After this intervention, the modal grades of women enrolled in the course increased from a C to a B. Psychological interventions such as this one show promise for increasing women's achievement in math and science courses and reducing the achievement gap that exists between the genders in these subject areas, but further research will need to be done in order to determine whether the positive effects are long-lasting.&lt;ref name="Miyake"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Akira |last=Miyake |first2=Lauren E. |last2=Kost-Smith |first3=Noah D. |last3=Finkelstein |first4=Steven J. |last4=Pollock |first5=Geoffrey L. |last5=Cohen |first6=Tiffany A. |last6=Ito |displayauthors=1 |year=2010 |title=Reducing the Gender Achievement Gap in College Science: A Classroom Study of Values Affirmation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=330 |issue=6008 |pages=1234–1237 |doi=10.1126/science.1195996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Barriers for disadvantaged students and efforts to close the gap    ==
Another explanation to address this educational gap is the lack of resources attainable by certain groups of students. A study found that there is a need for financial literacy for students enrolled in colleges and universities. Specifically, there is a need for student knowledge about loans, budgeting, and time requirements for degree completion .&lt;ref&gt;Eichelberger, Brenda, Mattioli, Heather, &amp; Foxhoven, Rachel. (2017). Uncovering Barriers to Financial Capability: Underrepresented Students' Access to Financial Resources. ''Journal of Student Financial Aid,'' ''47''(3), Journal of Student Financial Aid, 2017, Vol.47(3)&lt;/ref&gt; Focus group results in the same study concluded that students in search of financial aid information believe that there will be a lack of understanding among advisors and staff regarding minority student's cultural/identity based circumstances. As a result of this belief, many students rather just not seek any services. 

On the high school level, a report finds that the greater the amount of people of color enrolled at any particular school, the less likely that school has any computer science courses whatsoever .&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Zelinski, N. (2015, May). "Path not found": Report says low-income students lack computer access. ''Oakland Post'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://libproxy.csun.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.csun.edu/docview/1686085124?accountid=7285&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide economics indicate 1.3 million new jobs in the tech industry by 2022. Meanwhile, African Americans and Latinos only make up about 5 percent of the technical work force. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Supplemental funding for targeted disadvantaged school districts in Ohio showed a reduction in performance gaps between disadvantaged districts and other districts. Supplementing state funds for the districts with higher amount of disadvantaged students produced benefits in the form of student achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Gary T., Fortner, C. Kevin, &amp; Thompson, Charles L. (2010). Targeted Funding for Educationally Disadvantaged Students: A Regression Discontinuity Estimate of the Impact on High School Student Achievement. ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis,'' ''32''(2), 183-204.&lt;/ref&gt; IDA's or individual development account initiatives introduced in the 1990s to address poverty was found on the belief that poor family's should have access to asset development in order to break the cycle of poverty.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kezar, A., Lester, J., &amp; Yang, H. (2010). Nonprofits Partnering With Postsecondary Institutions to Increase Low-Income Student Access. Educational Policy, 24(3), 500-533.&lt;/ref&gt; As of now most IDA's main focus is on home ownership or starting small businesses. There has been a push for partnerships between community agencies and higher education institutions that would offer IDA's to encourage lower income individuals to turn towards higher education. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It has most commonly been used either during union organizing efforts, or during strikes. The aim most often is to prevent a union from forming, to destroy an existing union, or to reduce the effectiveness of a union or a particular strike action. If strikers prevent people or goods to enter or leave a workplace, violence may be used to allow people and goods to pass the picket line.

Violence against unions may be isolated, or may occur as part of a campaign that includes spying, intimidation, impersonation, disinformation, and sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Violence in [[labor unrest|labor disputes]] may be the result of unreasonable polarization, or miscalculation. It may be willful and provoked, or senseless and tragic. On some occasions, violence in labor disputes may be purposeful and calculated,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hunter, Violence and the labor movement, Macmillan, 1914 (1919 version), page 318&lt;/ref&gt; for example the hiring and deployment of [[goon squad]]s to intimidate, threaten or even assault strikers.

== History ==

[[Image:Frank-little-d-1917.jpg|thumb|150px|Union organizer [[Frank Little (unionist)|Frank Little]] was pulled from his bed and lynched in 1917 because of his union activities]]

Historically, violence against unions has included attacks by detective and guard agencies, such as the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkertons]], [[Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency|Baldwin Felts]], [[William J. Burns International Detective Agency|Burns]], or [[Thiel Detective Service Company|Thiel]] detective agencies; citizens groups, such as the [[Citizens' Alliance]]; company guards; police; national guard; or even the military. In particular, there are few curbs on what detective agencies are able to get away with.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''From Blackjacks To Briefcases'', Robert Michael Smith states that during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, anti-union agencies spawned violence and wreaked havoc on the labor movement.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; One investigator who participated in a [[Commission on Industrial Relations|congressional inquiry into industrial violence]] in 1916 concluded that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Espionage is closely related to violence. Sometimes it is the direct cause of violence, and, where that cannot be charged, it is often the indirect cause. If the [[Labor spies|secret agents of employers]], working as members of the labor unions, do not always investigate acts of violence, they frequently encourage them. If they did not, they would not be performing the duties for which they are paid, for they are hired on the theory that labor organizations are criminal in character.&lt;ref&gt;William White, The New republic, Volume 26, Republic Pub. Co., 1921, page 129, quoting Luke Grant&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In U.S. Senate testimony in 1936 about an employer who wanted to contract with the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton agency]]. Known personally to the author of the book ''The Pinkerton Story'', this employer was characterized as a "sincerely upright and Godly man." Yet Pinkerton files record that the employer wanted the agency "to send in some thugs who could beat up the strikers."&lt;ref&gt;The Pinkerton Story, James D. Horan and Howard Swiggett, 1951, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the Pinkerton agency changed its focus from strike-breaking to undercover services.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 75, quoting ''Strikebreaking Services'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinkerton declined the request from this employer.&lt;ref&gt;The Pinkerton Story, James D. Horan and Howard Swiggett, 1951, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Morris Friedman]], detective agencies were themselves for-profit companies, and a "bitter struggle" between capital and labor could be counted upon to create "satisfaction and immense profit" for agencies such as the Pinkerton company.&lt;ref&gt;The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Morris Friedman, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Such agencies were in the perfect position to fan suspicion and mistrust "into flames of blind and furious hatred" on the part of the companies.&lt;ref&gt;The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Morris Friedman, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agencies sell tactics including violence===

Harry Wellington Laidler wrote a book in 1913 detailing how one of the largest union busters in the United States, [[Corporations Auxiliary Company]], had a sales pitch offering the use of provocation and violence. The agency would routinely tell employers — prospective clients — of the methods used by their undercover operatives,&lt;ref&gt;Harry Wellington Laidler, Boycotts and the labor struggle economic and legal aspects, John Lane company, 1913, pages 291-292&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Once the union is in the field its members can keep it from growing if they know how, and our man knows how. Meetings can be set far apart. A contract can at once be entered into with the employer, covering a long period, and made very easy in its terms. However, these tactics may not be good, and the union spirit may be so strong that a big organization cannot be prevented. In this case our man turns extremely radical. He asks for unreasonable things and keeps the union embroiled in trouble. If a strike comes, he will be the loudest man in the bunch, and will counsel violence and get somebody in trouble. The result will be that the union will be broken up."&lt;ref&gt;Harry Wellington Laidler, Boycotts and the labor struggle economic and legal aspects, John Lane company, 1913, pages 291-292&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Different types of violence===

[[Image:Lattimer massacre.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Striking Pennsylvania mine workers began their protest march near Harwood. [[Lattimer massacre|Many would soon be killed by the Luzerne County sheriff.]]]]Some anti-union violence appears to be random, such as an incident during the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|1912 textile strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], in which a police officer fired into a crowd of strikers, killing [[Anna LoPizzo]].&lt;ref&gt;William Dudley Haywood, Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, page 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-union violence may be used as a means to intimidate others, as in the [[Frank Little (unionist)|hanging of union organizer Frank Little]] from a railroad trestle in [[Butte, Montana]]. A note was pinned to his body which said, "Others Take Notice! First And Last Warning!" The initial of the last names of seven well-known union activists in the Butte area were on the note, with the "L" for Frank Little circled.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 223-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Carlson, Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983, pages 17, 248-249&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-union violence may be abrupt and unanticipated. Three years after Frank Little was lynched, a strike by Butte miners was suppressed with gunfire when deputized mine guards suddenly fired upon unarmed picketers in the [[Anaconda Road Massacre]]. Seventeen were shot in the back as they tried to flee, and one man died.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Murphy, Mining cultures: men, women, and leisure in Butte, 1914-41, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ludlow Death Car.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Machine gun equipped armored car built with steel from [[CF&amp;I|CF&amp;I's Pueblo steel works]], known to the striking miners as the ''Death Special''. "The machine gun was turned on striking miners and used to riddle the Forbes tent colony."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, page 97&lt;/ref&gt;]]The unprovoked attack was similar to another event, which had occurred twenty-three years earlier in Pennsylvania. During the [[Lattimer massacre]], nineteen unarmed immigrant coal miners were suddenly gunned down at the Lattimer mine near [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania]], on September 10, 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John W.

Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Novak, Michael. Unmeltable Ethnics: Politics and Culture in American Life. 2d ed. New York: Transaction Publishers, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The shooting followed a brief tussle over the American flag carried by the miners. Their only crime was asserting their right to march in the face of demands that they disperse.

In 1927, during a coal strike in [[Colorado]], state police and mine guards fired pistols, rifles and a machine gun into a group of five hundred striking miners and their wives in what came to be called the [[Columbine Mine massacre|Columbine Mine Massacre]]. In this incident as well, many of the miners were immigrants, and there had been a disagreement over the question of trespassing onto company property in the town of [[Serene, Colorado|Serene]], with the miners asserting it was public property because of the post office. There was, once again, a tussle over American flags carried by the strikers.

While the Columbine mine shooting was a surprise, newspapers played a deadly role in conjuring the atmosphere of hate in which  the violence occurred. Lurid editorials attacked the ethnicity of the strikers.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Myers, Slaughter in Serene, The Columbine Coal Strike Reader, The Columbine Mine Massacre, pub. Bread and Roses Workers' Cultural Center and Industrial Workers of the World, 2005, pages 135-136&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers began calling for the governor to no longer withhold the "mailed fist", to strike hard and strike swiftly,&lt;ref&gt;''Denver Morning Post'' editorial, November 2, 1927, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; and for "Machine Guns Manned By Willing Shooters" at more of the state's coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;Boulder Daily Camera, November 17, 1927, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; Within days of these editorials, state police and mine guards fired on the miners and their wives, injuring dozens and killing six.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Myers, Slaughter in Serene, The Columbine Coal Strike Reader, The Columbine Mine Massacre, pub. Bread and Roses Workers' Cultural Center and Industrial Workers of the World, 2005, pages 138-139&lt;/ref&gt;

In all of the above incidents, the perpetrators were never caught, or went unpunished. An exception resulted from a shooting of strikers at the Williams &amp; Clark Fertilizing Company near the Liebig Fertilizer Works at [[Carteret, New Jersey]] in 1915. One striker was killed outright, and more than twenty were injured in an unprovoked attack when deputies fired on strikers who had stopped a train to check for strikebreakers. The strikers found no strikebreakers, and were cheering as they exited the train. Forty deputies approached and suddenly fired on them with revolvers, rifles, and shotguns. As the strikers ran, "the deputies ... pursued, firing again and again."&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, "1 KILLED, 20 SHOT BY STRIKE GUARDS; Deputies Drive Off Laborers at the Liebig Fertilizer Works in Carteret, N.J.", January 20, 1915, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; According to attending physicians, all the strikers' wounds were on the backs or legs, indicating the guards were pursuing them.&lt;ref&gt;The Survey, January 30, 1915, page 458&lt;/ref&gt; A local government official who witnessed the shooting called it entirely unprovoked.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, "1 KILLED, 20 SHOT BY STRIKE GUARDS; Deputies Drive Off Laborers at the Liebig Fertilizer Works in Carteret, N.J.", January 20, 1915, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; Four more of the strikers, all critically injured, would die. Twenty-two of the guards were arrested and the crime was investigated by a Grand Jury; nine deputies were subsequently convicted of manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other anti-union violence may seem orchestrated, as in 1914 when mine guards and the state militia fired into a tent colony of striking miners in Colorado, an incident that came to be known as the [[Ludlow Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, H. "The Ludlow Massacre", A People's History of the United States. pgs 346–349&lt;/ref&gt; During that strike, the company hired the Baldwin Felts agency, which built an armored car so their agents could approach the strikers' tent colonies with impunity. The strikers called it the "Death Special". At the Forbes tent colony,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[The Death Special] opened fire, a protracted spurt that sent some six hundred bullets tearing through the thin tents. One of the shots struck miner Luka Vahernik, fifty, in the head, killing him instantly. Another striker, Marco Zamboni, eighteen ... suffered nine bullet wounds to his legs... One tent was later found to have about 150 bullet holes..."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, page 98&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After deaths of women and children at Ludlow,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he backlash was vicious and bloody. Over the next ten days striking miners poured out their rage in attacks across the coalfields...&lt;ref&gt;Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The U.S. Army was called upon to put an end to the violence, and the strike sputtered to an end that December.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, pages 3,212&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-union violence may be devious and subtle, as when [[union busting]] specialist Martin Jay Levitt assigned confederates to scratch up cars in the parking lot of a nursing home during an organizing drive, and then blamed it on the union as part of an anti-union campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Confessions of a Union Buster, Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As a result of Operative Smith's "clever and intelligent" work, a number of union organizers received severe beatings at the hands of unknown masked men, presumably in the employ of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedman, The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Friedman offers examples of these incidents:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
About February 13, 1904, William Farley, of Alabama, a member of the [UMWA] National Executive Board ... and the personal representative of [UMWA] [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|President Mitchell]] ... addressed coal miners' meetings ... [on their return trip] eight masked men held them up with revolvers, dragged them from their wagon, threw them to the ground, beat them, kicked them, and almost knocked them into insensibility.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedman, The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On Saturday, April 30, 1904, W.M. Wardjon, a national organizer of the United Mine Workers, while on board a train en route to [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], was assaulted by three men at [[Sargents, Colorado|Sargents]], about thirty miles west of [[Salida, Colorado|Salida]]. Mr. Wardjon was beaten into unconsciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedman, The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Morris Friedman accused the [[Colorado Fuel and Iron|Colorado Fuel and Iron Company]] (CF&amp;I), operated by [[John D. Rockefeller]] and his lieutenant in Colorado, Jesse Welborn, of responsibility for the beatings during the 1903-04 strike.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedman, The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, there is simultaneous violence on both sides. In an auto workers strike organised by [[Victor G. Reuther|Victor Reuther]] and others in 1937, "[u]nionists assembled rocks, steel hinges, and other objects to throw at the cops, and police organized [[tear gas]] attacks and mounted charges."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Lichtenstein, Walter Reuther: the most dangerous man in Detroit, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colorado labor war, 1903-1904 ===
[[Image:Gen sherman bell.jpg|left|thumb|140px|General Sherman Bell. Photo from [[The Pinkerton Labor Spy]], published in 1907.]][[Image:Karl linderfelt.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Karl Linderfelt, center. Photo caption reads: "OFFICERS OF THE COLORADO NATIONAL GUARD From left to right: Captain R. J. Linderfelt, Lieut. T. C. Linderfelt, Lieut. K. E. Linderfelt, (who faced the charge of assault upon Louis Tikas, the dead strike leader), Lieut. G.S. Lawrence and Major Patrick Hamrock. The last three were in the Ludlow battle of April 20, 1914."]]A study of industrial violence in 1969 concluded, "There is no episode in American labor history in which violence was as systematically used by employers as in the [[Colorado Labor Wars|Colorado labor war of 1903 and 1904]]."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

About the middle of February, 1904, leadership of the Colorado National Guard became concerned that the Mine Owners were failing to cover the payroll of the soldiers. General Reardon ordered Major Ellison to take another soldier he could trust to "hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine" in order to convince the mine owners to pay.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Freeland Post, The Public, November 5, 1904, page 487&lt;/ref&gt; The implication of the secrecy was, the incident would then be blamed on the union.

However, Major Ellison reported that the miners took a route out of the mine that would not make ambush possible. Reardon ordered Ellison to pursue an alternative plan, which was shooting up one of the mines. Major Ellison and Sergeant Gordon Walter fired sixty shots into two mine buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Freeland Post, The Public, November 5, 1904, page 487&lt;/ref&gt; The plan worked, and the mine owners paid up. Ellison would later testify (in October 1904) that General Reardon informed him 
Adjutant General Sherman Bell and [[James Hamilton Peabody|Colorado Governor James Peabody]] knew about the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Freeland Post, The Public, November 5, 1904, page 487&lt;/ref&gt; Major Ellison's testimony about the shooting plot, and about the staged attacks on striking miners, was corroborated by two other soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Freeland Post, The Public, November 5, 1904, page 487&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ludlow massacre, 1914===
Professor James H. Brewster, a faculty attorney with the [[University of Colorado]] who was investigating the strike for [[Elias M. Ammons|Governor Ammons]], was aware that militia Lieutenant [[Karl Linderfelt]] was guilty of abuse and beatings of innocent citizens, including a small Greek boy "whose head was split open".&lt;ref&gt;Industrial relations, Final Report and Testimony Submitted to Congress by the Commission on Industrial Relations, Volume 7, 1916, pages 6632-6668&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, Dana Frank, Robin D. G. Kelley, Three Strikes: Miners, Musicians, Salesgirls, and the Fighting Spirit of Labor's Last Century, Beacon Press, 2002, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Brewster sent a telegram to Governor Ammons requesting Linderfelt's removal. No action was taken. In a subsequent face to face meeting with the governor, three months prior to the Ludlow Massacre, Brewster again insisted that Linderfelt be removed, but again, Ammons declined. In later testimony, Professor Brewster stated that Linderfelt was the reason for the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial relations, Final Report and Testimony Submitted to Congress by the Commission on Industrial Relations, Volume 7, 1916, pages 6632-6668&lt;/ref&gt; On the day that the [[Ludlow Massacre]] occurred, Lieutenant Karl Linderfelt, commander of one of two companies of the Colorado National Guard, had [[Louis Tikas]], leader of the Ludlow tent colony of striking miners, at gunpoint. Tikas was unarmed, and the miners would later explain that he approached the militia to ask them to stop shooting.&lt;ref&gt;Zeese Papanikolas, Buried Unsung, Louis Tikas and the Ludlow Massacre, University of Nebraska Press, 1982, page 226&lt;/ref&gt; While two militiamen held Tikas, Linderfelt broke a rifle butt over his head. Tikas and two other captured miners were later found shot dead. Tikas had been shot in the back.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Thomas G., Killing for Coal: America's Deadliest Labor War (Harvard UP, 2008) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Their bodies lay along the Colorado and Southern railroad tracks for three days in full view of passing trains. The militia officers refused to allow them to be moved until a local of a railway union demanded the bodies be taken away for burial. A court martial found Lieutenant Linderfelt guilty of assaulting Tikas with a Springfield rifle, "but attaches no criminality thereto. And the court does therefor acquit him."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, Dana Frank, Robin D. G. Kelley, Three Strikes: Miners, Musicians, Salesgirls, and the Fighting Spirit of Labor's Last Century, Beacon Press, 2002, page 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===1916 Congressional investigation===

In 1916, the [[Commission on Industrial Relations]], created by the [[U.S. Congress]], issued a final report on its investigation of industrial unrest. On the question of violence in industrial disputes, the Commission stated, in part,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Many instances of the use of physical force by the agents of employers have ... come before the Commission, indicating a relatively wide use, particularly in isolated communities.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Patrick Walsh, Basil M. Manly, John Rogers Commons, Final report of the Commission on industrial relations, United States. Commission on Industrial Relations, Barnard &amp; Miller print, 1915, pages 139-142&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Late 20th century anti-union violence==

By the early 1900s, public tolerance for violence during labor disputes began to decrease. Yet violence involving strikebreaking troops and armed guards continued into the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvi. The new methods were still effective at controlling, or reducing, unions.&lt;/ref&gt; The level of violence that anti-union agencies engaged in eventually resulted in their tactics becoming increasingly public, for there were a very great number of newspaper and muckraking articles written about such incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, pp. xvi-xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Resources that once were allocated to overt control over workforces began to be assigned to other methods of control, such as industrial espionage.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, the public no longer considered companies unassailable.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet legislation related to employer strategies such as violent strike breaking would have to wait until after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1950s, employers began to embrace new methods of managing workers and unions which were still effective, but much more subtle.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1969 study of labor conflict violence in the United States examined the era following the 1947 passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, and noted that attacks on strikers by company guards had all but disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence still occurs in labor disputes, for example, when one side miscalculates. Bringing in outside security forces, as one example, can lead to violence in modern labor disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of cameras and camcorders may affect levels of violence in labor disputes today.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples since 1940 ===

*[[Victor Reuther]], a leader of the [[United Auto Workers]] in [[Detroit]], survived an assassination attempt in 1949, with the loss of his right eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/05/us/victor-reuther-influential-labor-leader-dies-at-92.html|title=Victor Reuther, Influential Labor Leader, Dies at 92|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|date=2004-06-05|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threats ===

Sometimes, threats of violence cause damage to union members or supporters. Other times, threats against unions or their members may backfire. For example, Indiana Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Cox was fired after suggesting that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker should use live ammunition against pro-union protesters involved in the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]]. More recently, a Deputy Prosecutor in Indiana's Johnson County, Carlos Lam, suggested that Governor Walker should mount a "[[false flag]]" operation which would make it ''appear'' as if the union was committing violence. After initially claiming that his email account was hacked, Lam admitted to sending the suggestion and resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Cassens Weiss, American Bar Association Journal, posted Mar 25, 2011, http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/a_second_indiana_prosecutor_is_out_of_a_job_for_unusual_advice_to_wisconsin/ retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CBS News, posted March 25, 2011, {{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412225147/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |archivedate=2012-04-12 |df= }} retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Cullen Werwie, press secretary for Governor Walker, states that Walker's office was unaware of Lam's email. According to CBS News, Werwie also commented, "Certainly we do not support the actions suggested in (the) email. Governor Walker has said time and again that the protesters have every right to have their voice heard, and for the most part the protests have been peaceful. We are hopeful that the tradition will continue."&lt;ref&gt;Debra Cassens Weiss, American Bar Association Journal, posted Mar 25, 2011, http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/a_second_indiana_prosecutor_is_out_of_a_job_for_unusual_advice_to_wisconsin/ retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CBS News, posted March 25, 2011, {{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412225147/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047130-503544.html |archivedate=2012-04-12 |df= }} retrieved April 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''binary clock''' is a [[clock]] that displays the time of day in a [[binary numeral system|binary]] format.  Originally, such clocks showed ''each decimal digit'' of sexagesimal time as a binary value, but presently binary clocks also exist which display hours, minutes, and seconds as binary numbers. Most binary clocks are [[Digital data|digital]], although [[analog signal|analog]] varieties exist. True binary clocks also exist, which indicate the time by successively halving the day, instead of using hours, minutes, or seconds. Similar clocks, based on [[Gray code]]d binary, also exist. 

== Binary-coded decimal clocks ==
[[File:Binary clock.svg|thumbnail|right|Reading a [[binary-coded decimal|BCD]] [[clock]]: Add the values of each column of [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] to get six decimal digits. There are two columns each for [[hour]]s, [[minute]]s and [[second]]s.]]
[[File:Digital-BCD-clock.jpg|thumbnail|right|Both clocks read 12:15:45.]]

Most common binary clocks  use six columns of [[LED]]s to represent [[0 (number)|zeros]] and [[1 (number)|ones]]. Each column represents a single decimal digit, a format known as [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD). The bottom row in each column represents 1 (or 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), with each row above representing higher powers of two, up to 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (or 8). 

To read each individual digit in the time, the user adds the values that each illuminated [[light-emitting diode|LED]] represents, then reads these from left to right. The first two columns represent the [[hour]], the next two represent the [[minute]] and the last two represent the [[second]]. Since zero digits are not illuminated, the positions of each digit must be memorized if the clock is to be usable in the dark.

== Binary-coded sexagesimal clocks ==

[[File:Binary clock samui moon.jpg|thumbnail|right|Time Technology's Samui Moon binary-coded sexagesimal wristwatch. This clock reads 3:25.]]

Binary clocks that display time in binary-coded [[sexagesimal]] also exist. Instead of representing each digit of traditional sexagesimal time with one binary number, each component of traditional sexagesimal time is represented with one binary number, that is, using up to 6 bits instead of only 4.

For 24-hour binary-coded sexagesimal clocks, there are 11 or 17 LED lights to show us the time.  There are 5 LEDs to show the hours, there are 6 LEDs to show the minutes, and there are 6 LEDs to show the seconds. 6 LEDs to show the seconds are not needed in 24-hour binary-coded sexagesimal clocks with 11 LED lights.

'''Civil courage''' is a type of courage, related closely to heroism, in which a person acts [[bravery|bravely]] to intervene in a social situation.

==Overview==
Italian journalist and writer {{ill|Franca Magnani|de}} (1925-1996) wrote, "Je mehr Bürger mit Zivilcourage ein Land hat, desto weniger Helden wird es einmal brauchen" ("The more citizens with civil courage which a country has, the fewer heroes it needs").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologie.uzh.ch/de/bereiche/sob/motivation/zivilcourage/zivilcourage.html |title=Über Zivilcourage |language=German |website=[[University of Zurich]] |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil Courage today ==

Civil courage has been referred to by [[psychologist]] Tobias Greitemeyer as constituting acts of [[bravery]], carried out with the objective of enforcing a societal or ethical standard, without concern for the effect these acts might have on one’s own position. In this way it is distinguished from [[alturism|altruistic]] behavior and other forms of courage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greitemeyer|first1=Tobias|title=Civil courage: Implicit theories, related concepts, and measurement|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|volume=2|issue=2|pages=115–119|doi=10.1080/17439760701228789|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of altruistic, helping behavior, an individual might expect to be praised or receive positive social consequences from the result of their having helped, despite possible financial or material loss. In actions where civil courage is demonstrated, the person carrying out the action may experience negative social consequences such as alienation, verbal abuse or violence. Civil courage is displayed when a person, in spite of the perceived threat of negative consequences acts to intervene in a social context. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osswald|first1=Silvia|title=What Is Moral Courage?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1671">In [[mathematics]], and particularly in [[axiomatic set theory]], '''♣&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;''' ('''clubsuit''') is a family of [[Combinatorics|combinatorial principle]]s that are a weaker version of the corresponding [[diamondsuit|◊&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;]]; it was introduced in 1975&lt;!--by A. Ostaszewski, but no article exists for him--&gt;.

== Definition ==

For a given [[cardinal number]] &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and a [[stationary set]] &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq \kappa&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\clubsuit_{S}&lt;/math&gt; is the statement that there is a [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;\left\langle A_\delta: \delta \in S\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; such that

* every ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;/sub&gt; is a cofinal [[subset]] of ''δ''
* for every [[Ordinal_number#Closed_unbounded_sets_and_classes|unbounded subset]] &lt;math&gt; A \subseteq \kappa&lt;/math&gt;, there is a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;A_{\delta} \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\clubsuit_{\omega_1}&lt;/math&gt; is usually written as just &lt;math&gt;\clubsuit&lt;/math&gt;.

== ♣ and ◊ ==

It is clear that [[Diamond principle|◊]] ⇒ ♣, and it was shown in 1975 &lt;!-- again by A. Ostaszewski--&gt; that ♣ + [[continuum hypothesis|CH]] ⇒ ◊; however, [[Saharon Shelah]] gave a proof in 1980 that there exists a model of ♣ in which CH does not hold, so ♣ and ◊ are not equivalent (since ◊ ⇒ CH).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1610">The '''Composition of Causes''' was a set of [[philosophy|philosophical]] laws advanced by [[John Stuart Mill]] in his watershed essay ''[[A System of Logic]]''. These laws outlined Mill's view of the [[epistemological]] components of [[emergentism]], a school of philosophical laws that posited a decidedly opportunistic approach to the classic dilemma of [[causation nullification]]. 

Mill was determined to prove that the intrinsic properties of all things relied on three primary tenets, which he called the Composition of Causes. These were:

1. The Cause of Inherent Efficiency, a methodological understanding of deterministic forces engaged in the perpetual axes of the soul, as it pertained to its own self-awareness.

2. The so-called Sixth Cause, a conceptual notion embodied by the system of inter-related segments of social and elemental vitra. This was a hotly debated matter in early 17th-century philosophical circles, especially in the halls of the Reichtaven in [[Meins]], where the spirit of Geudl still lingered.

3. The Cause of Multitude, an evolutionary step taken from Hemmlich's Plurality of a Dysfunctional Enterprise, detailing the necessary linkage between both sets of perception-based self-awareness.

Furthermore, the Composition of Causes elevated Mill's standing in [[ontological]] circles, lauded by his contemporaries for applying a conceptual vision of an often-argued discipline.

'''Conation''' (from the [[Latin]] ''[[conatus]]'') is any natural tendency, impulse, striving, or directed effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary (Second Edition, CD-ROM Version 3.00) |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |quote=1. An effort, endeavour, striving. 2. ''transf.'' A force, impulse, or tendency simulating human effort; a nisus.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conative is one of three parts of the mind, along with the [[affective]] and [[cognitive]].&lt;ref name="hilgard1980trilogy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilgard|first1=Ernest R.|title=The trilogy of mind: Cognition, affection, and conation|journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences|date=April 1980|volume=16|issue=2|pages=107–117|doi=10.1002/1520-6696(198004)16:2&lt;107::aid-jhbs2300160202&gt;3.0.co;2-y|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the cognitive part of the brain has to do with intelligence, the affective deals with emotions and the conative drives how one acts on those thoughts and feelings.

The term ''conation'' is no longer widely known—it is in "The 1,000 Most Obscure Words in the English Language," defined as "the area of one's active mentality that has to do with desire, volition and striving,"&lt;ref name="o1"/&gt; but there are several references to conation as the third faculty of the mind.

''Conation'' is defined by [[Funk &amp; Wagnalls]] ''Standard Comprehensive International Dictionary'' (1977) as "the aspect of mental process directed by change and including impulse, desire, volition and striving," and by the Living Webster ''Encyclopedia Dictionary of the English Language'' (1980) as "one of the three modes, together with cognition and affection, of mental function; a conscious effort to carry out seemingly volitional acts." ''The Encyclopedia of Psychology "Motivation: Philosophical Theories"'' says, "Some mental states seem capable of triggering action, while others—such as cognitive states—apparently have a more subordinate role [in terms of motivation] ... some behavior qualifies as motivated action, but some does not."&lt;ref name="o2"/&gt;

[[Abraham Maslow]], the creator of "[[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]", discussed the idea of conation in his widely cited work "A Theory of Human Motivation". In his work, he states that cognition is itself conative. That is, that the desire to know comes from an act of will, that effectively therefore conation is prepotent to cognition. "We must guard ourselves against the too easy tendency to separate [the desire to know] from the basic needs we have discussed above, i.e., to make a sharp dichotomy between 'cognitive' and 'conative' needs. The desire to know and to understand are themselves conative, i.e., have a striving character, and are as much personality needs as the 'basic needs' we have already discussed."&lt;ref name="o3"/&gt;

'''DOCAM''' ('''Documentation and Conservation of the Media Arts Heritage''') is an international research alliance on the documentation and the conservation of the [[media arts]] heritage.

DOCAM's main objective is to develop new methodologies and tools to address the issues of preserving and documenting [[digital art]], technological and [[electronic art|electronic works of art]]. Over the project's five-year mandate, numerous case studies will be conducted that will focus on documentary collections and conserving works of art featuring technological content.

DOCAM's key areas of focus include:
* The conservation of works of art featuring technological components;
* Documentation strategies and structures adapted to these works of art;
* A typology and historical listing of the technologies deployed by the artists;
* Catalogue structures and methods for works featuring technological components; and
* Terminological tools and structures for the electronic arts.

The DOCAM research alliance is composed of some 20 institutional partners from around the world. It also brings together more than 20 specialists and researchers in domains such as [[new media art preservation]], the cataloguing of museum collections, art history, information management, archival science, art documentation and computer science. The project is supported by the [[Social Science and Humanities Research Council|Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)]] and the [[Daniel Langlois Foundation]].

Moreover, governments have been reluctant to formulate an agreed upon and legally binding definition.

*It is the use of violence or threat of violence in the pursuit of political, religious, ideological or social objectives.
*It can be committed by governments, [[non-state actor]]s, or [[Undercover operation|undercover personnel]] serving on the behalf of their respective governments. 
*It reaches more than the immediate target victims and is also directed at targets consisting of a larger spectrum of society. 
*It is both [[Criminal law#Mala in se v. mala prohibita|mala prohibita (i.e., crime that is made illegal by legislation) and mala in se (i.e., crime that is inherently immoral or wrong)]].

The following criteria of violence or threat of violence fall outside of the definition of terrorism:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dtra/terrorism_concepts.pdf Terrorism: Concepts, Causes, and Conflict Resolution], Jan 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azdema.gov/museum/famousbattles/pdf/Terrorism%20Definitions%20072809.pdf Various Definitions of Terrorism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319000454/http://www.azdema.gov/museum/famousbattles/pdf/Terrorism%20Definitions%20072809.pdf |date=2016-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many reasons as to why there is no universal consensus regarding the definition of terrorism. Angus Martyn in a briefing paper for the Australian Parliament has stated that "The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism. During the 1970s and 1980s, the [[United Nations]] attempts to define the term foundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of [[Wars of national liberation|conflicts over national liberation]] and [[self-determination]]."&lt;ref name=Martyn&gt;Angus Martyn, [http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/CIB/2001-02/02cib08.htm The Right of Self-Defence under International Law-the Response to the Terrorist Attacks of 11 September] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429023013/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/CIB/2001-02/02cib08.htm |date=April 29, 2009 }}, Australian Law and Bills Digest Group, Parliament of Australia Web Site, 12 February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These divergences have made it impossible to conclude a [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]] that incorporates a single, all-encompassing, legally binding, criminal law definition of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz-Paniagua (2008),  p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, the [[international community]] adopted a series of [[Definition of terrorism#The sectoral approach|sectoral conventions]] that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities. In addition, since 1994, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] has condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism: "Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance [[Theory of justification|unjustifiable]], whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them."&lt;ref&gt;1994 United Nations Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism annex to UN General Assembly resolution 49/60 ,"Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism", of December 9, 1994, [https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/49/a49r060.htm  UN Doc. A/Res/60/49]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study by Jeffrey Record for the [[United States Army]] quoted a source (Schmid and Jongman 1988) that counted 109 definitions of [[terrorism]] that covered a total of 22 different definitional elements.&lt;ref name="Record-p6-fn10"&gt;Record, p. 6 (page 12 of the PDF document), citing in footnote 10 Alex P. Schmid, Albert J. Jongman, et al., ''Political Terrorism: A New Guide to Actors, Authors, Concepts, Data Bases, Theories, and Literature'', New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction Books, 1988, pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Record continued "Terrorism expert [[Walter Laqueur]] also has counted over 100 definitions and concludes that the 'only general characteristic generally agreed upon is that terrorism involves violence and the threat of violence.' Yet terrorism is hardly the only enterprise involving violence and the threat of violence. So does war, coercive diplomacy, and bar room brawls".&lt;ref name="Record-p6-fn11"&gt;Record, p. 6 (page 12 of the PDF document) citing in footnote 11: Walter Laqueur, ''The New Terrorism: Fanaticism and the Arms of Mass Destruction'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Terrorism2 london times 1-30-1795.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A 30 January 1795 use of the word 'terrorism' in ''[[The Times]]'', an early appearance in English. The excerpt reads: "There exists more than one system to overthrow our liberty. Fanaticism has raised every passion; Royalism has not yet given up its hopes, and Terrorism feels bolder than ever."]]
The term "terrorism" comes from French {{lang|fr|terrorisme}}, from {{lang-la|terror}}, "great fear", "dread", related to the Latin verb {{lang|la|terrere}}, "to frighten". The {{lang|la|terror cimbricus}} was a panic and state of emergency in Rome in response to the approach of warriors of the [[Cimbri]] tribe in 105 BCE. The French [[National Convention]] declared in September 1793 that "terror is the order of the day". The period 1793–94 is referred to as {{lang|fr|La Terreur}} ([[Reign of Terror]]). [[Maximilien Robespierre]], a leader in the [[French revolution]] proclaimed in 1794 that "Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible."&lt;ref&gt;Burgess&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee of Public Safety]] agents that enforced the policies of "The Terror" were referred to as "Terrorists".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrorism-research.com/history/early.php Early History of Terrorism], http://Terrorism-Research.com&lt;/ref&gt; The word "terrorism" was first recorded in English-language dictionaries in 1798 as meaning "systematic use of [[terror]] as a policy".&lt;ref name=com&gt;Harper&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Reign of Terror was imposed by the French government, in modern times "terrorism" usually refers to the killing of people by non-governmental political activists for political reasons, often as a public statement. This meaning originated with Russian radicals in the 1870s. [[Sergey Nechayev]], who founded the ''[[People's Reprisal]]'' (Народная расправа) in 1869, described himself as a "terrorist".&lt;ref name="Crenshaw77"&gt;Crenshaw, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; German radicalist writer [[Johann Most]] helped popularize the modern sense of the word by dispensing "advice for terrorists" in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw44"&gt;Crenshaw, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Myra Williamson]]: "The meaning of "terrorism" has undergone a transformation. During the reign of terror a regime or system of terrorism was used as an instrument of governance, wielded by a recently established revolutionary state against the enemies of the people. Now the term "terrorism" is commonly used to describe terrorist acts committed by ''non-state or subnational entities'' against a state."&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Williamson, Myra|title=Terrorism, war and international law: the legality of the use of force against Afghanistan in 2001|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-7403-0|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuJIPP9HfRsC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In international law==

===The need to define terrorism in international criminal law===
[[Ben Saul]] has noted that a "A combination of pragmatic and principled arguments supports the case for defining terrorism in international law",&lt;ref&gt;Ben Saul, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1292059 "Defining 'Terrorism' to Protect Human Rights"] in Sydney Law School Legal Studies Research Paper, No. 08-125 (2008) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; including the need to condemn violations to [[human rights]], to protect the [[State (polity)|state]] and deliberative politics, to differentiate public and private violence, and to ensure international peace and security.
 
Carlos Diaz-Paniagua, who coordinated the negotiations of the proposed United Nations [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]], noted, on his part, the need to provide a precise definition of terrorist activities in international law: "Criminal law has three purposes: to declare that a conduct is forbidden, to prevent it, and to express society's condemnation for the wrongful acts.  The symbolic, normative role of criminalization is of particular importance in the case of terrorism.  The criminalization of terrorist acts expresses society's repugnance at them, invokes social censure and shame, and stigmatizes those who commit them.  Moreover, by creating and reaffirming values, criminalization may serve, in the long run, as a deterrent to terrorism, as those values are internalized."&lt;ref&gt;C.F. Diaz-Paniagua, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q2qHd6a-slIC&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Negotiating%20terrorism%3A%20the%20negotiation%20dynamics%20of%20four%20UN%20counter-terrorism%20treaties%2C%201997-2005&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Negotiating terrorism: The negotiation dynamics of four UN counter-terrorism treaties, 1997-2005''], City University of New York (2008) p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, international criminal law [[treaties]] that seek to prevent, condemn and punish terrorist activities, require precise definitions:

{{quote|The definition of the offence in criminal law treaty plays several roles.  First and foremost, it has the symbolic, normative role of expressing society's condemnation of the forbidden acts.  Second, it facilitates agreement.  Since states tend to be reluctant to undertake stringent obligations in matters related to the exercise of their domestic jurisdiction, a precise definition of the crime, which restricts the scope of those obligations, makes agreement less costly.  Third, it provides an inter-subjective basis for the homogeneous application of the treaty's obligations on judicial and police cooperation.  This function is of particular importance in extradition treaties because, to grant an extradition, most legal systems require that the crime be punishable both in the requesting state and the requested state.  Fourth, it helps states to enact domestic legislation to criminalize and punish the wrongful acts defined in the treaty in conformity with their human rights' obligations.  The principle of ''nullum crimen sine lege'' requires, in particular, that states define precisely which acts are prohibited before anyone can be prosecuted or punished for committing those same acts.&lt;ref&gt;C.F. Diaz-Paniagua, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q2qHd6a-slIC&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Negotiating%20terrorism%3A%20the%20negotiation%20dynamics%20of%20four%20UN%20counter-terrorism%20treaties%2C%201997-2005&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Negotiating terrorism: The negotiation dynamics of four UN counter-terrorism treaties, 1997-2005''], City University of New York (2008) pp. 46-7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saul noted in this sense that, missing a generally agreed, all-encompassing, definition of the term:
{{quote|'Terrorism' currently lacks the precision, objectivity and certainty demanded by legal discourse. Criminal law strives to avoid emotive terms to prevent prejudice to an accused, and shuns ambiguous or subjective terms as incompatible with the principle of non-retroactivity. If the law is to admit the term, advance definition is essential on grounds of fairness, and it is not sufficient to leave definition to the unilateral interpretations of States. Legal definition could plausibly retrieve terrorism from the ideological quagmire, by severing an agreed legal meaning from the remainder of the elastic, political concept. Ultimately it must do so without criminalizing legitimate violent resistance to oppressive regimes – and becoming complicit in that oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Saul, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1292059 "Defining 'Terrorism' to Protect Human Rights"] in Sydney Law School Legal Studies Research Paper, No. 08-125 (2008) p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Obstacles to a comprehensive definition====
Diaz-Paniagua has noted that, to "...create an effective legal regime against terrorism, it would be necessary to formulate a comprehensive definition of that crime that, on the one hand, provides the strongest moral condemnation to terrorist activities while, on the other hand, has enough precision to permit the prosecution of criminal activities without condemning acts that should be deemed to be legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;See Marsavelski, A. (2013) [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2329401 ''The Crime of Terrorism and the Right of Revolution in International Law']' (In Chapter II.A.4., entitled "Criteria for the Use of Revolutionary Force", Marsavelski provides four guiding principles for distinguishing legitimate acts of freedom fighters from terrorist acts). (Connecticut Journal of International law, Vol. 28) at pp. 278-75.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, due to major divergences at the international level on the question of the legitimacy of the use of violence for political purposes, either by states or by self-determination and revolutionary groups, this has not yet been possible."&lt;ref&gt;C.F. Diaz-Paniagua, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q2qHd6a-slIC&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Negotiating%20terrorism%3A%20the%20negotiation%20dynamics%20of%20four%20UN%20counter-terrorism%20treaties%2C%201997-2005&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Negotiating terrorism: The negotiation dynamics of four UN counter-terrorism treaties, 1997-2005''], City University of New York (2008) p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this sense, [[M. Cherif Bassiouni]] notes:
{{quote|to define 'terrorism' in a way that is both all-inclusive and unambiguous is very difficult, if not impossible.  One of the principle difficulties lies in the fundamental values at stake in the acceptance or rejection of terror-inspiring violence as means of accomplishing a given goal.  The obvious and well known range of views on these issues are what makes an internationally accepted specific definition of what is loosely called 'terrorism,' a largely impossible undertaking. That is why the search for and internationally agreed upon definition may well be a futile and unnecessary effort.&lt;ref&gt;M. Cherif Bassiouni, "A Policy-oriented Inquiry of 'International Terrorism'" in: M. Cherif Bassiouni, ed., ''Legal Responses to International Terrorism: U.S. Procedural Aspects'', (Dordrecht, Boston and London: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1988) xv – xvi.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Sami Zeidan, a Lebanese diplomat and scholar, explained the political reasons underlying the current difficulties to define terrorism as follows:
{{quote|There is no general consensus on the definition of terrorism. The difficulty of defining terrorism lies in the risk it entails of taking positions. The political value of the term currently prevails over its legal one. Left to its political meaning, terrorism easily falls prey to change that suits the interests of particular states at particular times. The Taliban and Osama bin Laden were once called freedom fighters (mujahideen) and backed by the CIA when they were resisting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Now they are on top of the international terrorist lists. Today, the United Nations views Palestinians as freedom fighters, struggling against the unlawful occupation of their land by Israel, and engaged in a long-established legitimate resistance, yet Israel regards them as terrorists. Israel also brands the Hizbullah of Lebanon as a terrorist group, whereas most of the international community regards it as a legitimate resistance group, fighting Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon. In fact, the successful ousting of Israeli forces from most of the South by the Hizbollah in 2000 made Lebanon the only Arab country to actually defeat the Israeli army. The repercussion of the current preponderance of the political over the legal value of terrorism is costly, leaving the war against terrorism selective, incomplete and ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Sami Zeidan, Desperately Seeking Definition: The International Community's Quest for Identifying the Specter of Terrorism, 36 Cornell International Law Journal (2004) pp. 491-92&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the same vein, [[Jason Burke]], a British reporter who writes about radical [[Islamist]] activity, said:
{{quote|There are multiple ways of defining terrorism, and all are subjective. Most define terrorism as "the use or threat of serious violence" to advance some kind of "cause". Some state clearly the kinds of group ("sub-national", "non-state") or cause (political, ideological, religious) to which they refer. Others merely rely on the instinct of most people when confronted with innocent civilians being killed or maimed by men armed with explosives, firearms or other weapons. None is satisfactory, and grave problems with the use of the term persist. Terrorism is after all, a tactic. The term "war on terrorism" is thus effectively nonsensical. As there is no space here to explore this involved and difficult debate, my preference is, on the whole, for the less loaded term "Militancy". This is not an attempt to condone such actions, merely to analyse them in a clearer way.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Burke. ''Al Qaeda'', ch. 2, p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The political and emotional connotation of the term "terrorism" makes difficult its use in legal discourse. In this sense, Saul notes that: 
{{quote|Despite the shifting and contested meaning of "terrorism" over time, the peculiar semantic power of the term, beyond its literal signification, is its capacity to stigmatize, delegitimize, denigrate, and dehumanize those at whom it is directed, including political opponents. The term is ideologically and politically loaded; pejorative; implies moral, social, and value judgment; and is "slippery and much-abused." In the absence of a definition of terrorism, the struggle over the representation of a violent act is a struggle over its legitimacy. The more confused a concept, the more it lends itself to opportunistic appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Saul, ''Defining Terrorism in International Law'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historically, the dispute on the meaning of terrorism arose since the [[laws of war]] were first codified in 1899. The [[Martens Clause]] was introduced as a compromise wording for the dispute between the [[Great Power]]s who considered [[francs-tireurs]] to be [[unlawful combatants]] subject to execution on capture, and smaller states who maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants.&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Ticehurst ([[#References|references]]) in hist footnote 1 cites The life and works of Martens are detailed by V. Pustogarov, "Fyodor Fyodorovich Martens (1845-1909) — A Humanist of Modern Times", ''International Review of the Red Cross'' (IRRC), No. 312, May–June 1996, pp. 300-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Ticehurst ([[#References|references]]) in hist footnote 2 cites  F. Kalshoven, ''Constraints on the Waging of War'', Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1987, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently the 1977 [[Protocol I|Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts]], which applies in situations [[Protocol I#Part I GENERAL PROVISIONS|Article 1. Paragraph 4]] "... in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes...", contains many ambiguities that cloud the issue of who is or is not a legitimate combatant.&lt;ref&gt;Gardam [https://books.google.com/books?id=MGT2hJFS9MkC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=in+which+peoples+are+fighting+against+colonial+domination+and+alien+occupation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=K_N1cgeQ2L&amp;sig=Mysj3VFtq3WBNFXpbpjqkbQpPao&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA91,M1  p. 91]&lt;/ref&gt;  
These difficulties have led Pamala Griset to conclude that: "the meaning of terrorism is embeded in a person's or nation's philosophy. Thus, the determination of the 'right' definition of terrorism is subjective." &lt;ref&gt;Griset, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YpmZ76zRW2oC&amp;lpg=PR13&amp;dq=Definitions%20of%20terrorism&amp;pg=PR13#v=onepage&amp;q=Definitions%20of%20terrorism&amp;f=false p. xiii]. See also: Smelser,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=KncntgBEQTMC&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Definitions%20of%20terrorism&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q=Definitions%20of%20terrorism&amp;f=false p. 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The sectoral approach====
To elaborate an effective legal [[International regime|regime]] to prevent and punish international terrorism—rather than only working on a single, all-encompassing, comprehensive definition of terrorism—the [[international community]] has also adopted a "...'sectoral' approach aimed at identifying offences seen as belonging to the activities of terrorists and working out treaties in order to deal with specific categories thereof".&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Andrea Gioia, "The UN Conventions on the Prevention and Suppression of International Terrorism" in Giuseppe Nesi, ed., ''International Cooperation in Counter-terrorism: The United Nations And Regional Organizations in the Fight Against Terrorism'', p. 4 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The treaties that follow this approach focus on the wrongful nature of terrorist activities rather than on their [[intention (criminal law)|intent]]:

{{quote|On the whole, therefore, the 'sectoral' conventions confirm the assumption that some offences can be considered ''in themselves'' as offences of international concern, irrespective of any 'terrorist' intent or purpose. Indeed, the principal merit of the 'sectoral approach' is that it avoids the need to define 'terrorism' of 'terrorist acts' ... So long as the 'sectoral' approach is followed, there is no need to define terrorism; a definition would only be necessary if the punishment of the relevant offences were made conditional on the existence of a specific 'terrorist' intent; but this would be counter-productive, inasmuch as it would result in unduly restricting their suppression.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; }}

Following this approach, the international community has adopted the following sectoral [[counter-terrorism]] conventions, open to the [[ratification]] of all states:

* The 1963 [[Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed On Board Aircraft]]
* The 1970 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft]]
* The 1971 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation]]
* The 1979 [[Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material]]
* The 1988 [[Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation]]
* The 1988 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation]]
* The 1988 [[Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf]]
* The 1991 [[Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Identification]]
* The 1997 [[International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings]].
* The 1999 [[International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism]]
* The 2005 [[International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism]]

Analyzing these treaties, Andrew Byrnes observed that: 
{{quote|These conventions – all of which are described by the United Nations as part of its panoply of anti-terrorist measures – share three principal characteristics:

(a) they all adopted an "operational definition" of a specific type of terrorist act that was defined without reference to the underlying political or ideological purpose or [[motive (law)|motivation]] of the perpetrator of the act – this reflected a [[consensus]] that there were some acts that were such a serious threat to the interests of all that they could not be justified by reference to such motives;

(b) they all focused on actions by [[non-state actor]]s (individuals and organisations) and the State was seen as an active ally in the struggle against terrorism – the question of the State itself as terrorist actor was left largely to one side; and

(c) they all adopted a [[criminal law]] enforcement model to address the problem, under which States would cooperate in the [[arrest|apprehension]] and prosecution of those alleged to have committed these crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes (2002), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Byrnes notes that "this act-specific approach to addressing problems of terrorism in binding international treaties has continued up until relatively recently. Although political denunciation of terrorism in all its forms had continued apace, there had been no successful attempt to define 'terrorism' as such in a broad sense that was satisfactory for legal purposes. There was also some scepticism as to the necessity, desirability and feasibility of producing an agreed and workable general definition."&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes (2002),  p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, since 2000, the United Nations General Assembly has been working on a proposed [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]].

===Comprehensive conventions===
The [[international community]] has worked on two comprehensive counter-terrorism treaties, the [[League of Nations]]' 1937 Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism, which never entered into force, and the [[United Nations]]' proposed [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]], which hasn't been finalized yet.

====League of Nations====
In the late 1930s, the [[international community]] made a first attempt at defining terrorism. Article 1.1 of the [[League of Nations]]' 1937 Convention for the prevention and punishment of Terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;League of Nations' 1937 [http://www.jur.uib.no/ansatte/joreh/temasider/internasjonalisering/Convention%20on%20terrorism%201937.pdf  Convention for the prevention and punishment of Terrorism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724185446/http://www.jur.uib.no/ansatte/joreh/temasider/internasjonalisering/Convention%20on%20terrorism%201937.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which never entered into force, defined "acts of terrorism" as "criminal acts directed against a State and intended or calculated to create a state of terror in the minds of particular persons or a group of persons or the general public". Article 2 included as terrorist acts, if they were directed against another state and if they constituted acts of terrorism within the meaning of the definition contained in article 1, the following:
{{quote|1. Any willful act causing death or grievous bodily harm or loss of liberty to:
:a) [[Head of state|Heads of State]], persons exercising the prerogatives of the head of the State, their [[Order of succession|hereditary or designated successors]];
:b) The wives or husbands or the above-mentioned persons;
:c) Persons charged with public functions or holding public positions when the act is directed against them in their public capacity.
2. Willful destruction of, or damage to, public property or property devoted to a public purpose belonging to or subject to the authority of another High Contracting Party.

3. Any willful act calculated to endanger the lives of members of the public.

4. Any attempt to commit an [[offence (law)|offence]] falling within the foregoing provisions of the present article.

5. The manufacture, obtaining, possession, or supplying of [[Weapon|arms]], [[ammunition]], [[explosives]] or harmful substances with the view to the commission in any country whatsoever of an offence falling within the present article.&lt;ref&gt;League of Nations, 1937 [http://www.jur.uib.no/ansatte/joreh/temasider/internasjonalisering/Convention%20on%20terrorism%201937.pdf  Convention for the prevention and punishment of Terrorism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724185446/http://www.jur.uib.no/ansatte/joreh/temasider/internasjonalisering/Convention%20on%20terrorism%201937.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}, art 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Proposed Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism====

Since 2000, the United Nations General Assembly has been negotiating a [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]]. The definition of the crime of terrorism, which has been on the negotiating table since 2002 reads as follows:
{{quote|1. Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person, by any means, unlawfully and intentionally, causes:
:(a) Death or serious bodily injury to any person; or
:(b) Serious damage to public or [[private property]], including a place of public use, a State or government facility, a public transportation system, an infrastructure facility or the environment; or
:(c) Damage to property, places, facilities, or systems referred to in paragraph 1 (b) of this article, resulting or likely to result in major economic loss, when the purpose of the conduct, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an [[international organization]] to do or abstain from doing any act.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, [http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N02/248/17/PDF/N0224817.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996, Sixth session (28 January-1 February 2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113112445/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N02/248/17/PDF/N0224817.pdf?OpenElement |date=13 January 2012 }}, Annex II, art. 2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among the negotiators, that definition is not controversial in itself; the deadlock in the negotiations arises instead  from the opposing views on whether such a definition would be applicable to the [[armed forces]] of a state and to [[self-determination]] movements. Thalif Deen described the situation as follows: "The key sticking points in the draft treaty revolve around several controversial yet basic issues, including the definition of ´terrorism´. For example, what distinguishes a "terrorist organisation" from a 'liberation movement'? And do you exclude activities of national armed forces, even if they are perceived to commit acts of terrorism? If not, how much of this constitutes 'state terrorism'?"&lt;ref&gt;Thalif Deen, [http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=29633 POLITICS:  U.N. Member States Struggle to Define Terrorism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053853/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=29633 |date=June 11, 2011 }}, IPS 25 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The coordinator of the negotiations, supported by most western delegations, proposed the following exceptions to address those issues:
{{quote|1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect other rights, obligations and responsibilities of States, peoples and individuals under international law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and international humanitarian law.

2. The activities of '''armed forces''' during an armed conflict, as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law, are not governed by this Convention.

3. The activities undertaken by the military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, '''inasmuch as they are governed''' by other rules of international law, are not governed by this Convention.

4. Nothing in this article condones or makes lawful otherwise unlawful acts, nor precludes prosecution under other laws.&lt;ref name="daccess-dds-ny.un.org"&gt;United Nations General Assembly, [http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N02/248/17/PDF/N0224817.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996, Sixth session (28 January-1 February 2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113112445/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N02/248/17/PDF/N0224817.pdf?OpenElement |date=13 January 2012 }}, Annex IV, art. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The state members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] proposed instead the following exceptions:
{{quote|2. The activities of 'the parties' during an armed conflict, 'including in situations of foreign occupation', as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law, are not governed by this Convention.

3. The activities undertaken by the military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, 'inasmuch as they are in conformity' with international law, are not governed by this Convention.&lt;ref name="daccess-dds-ny.un.org"/&gt;}}

===Sectoral conventions===
The various sectoral counter-terrorism [[treaty|conventions]] defines as terrorist particular categories of activities.

====Terrorist Bombings Convention====
Article 2.1 of the 1997 [[International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings]] defines the [[offence (law)|offence]] of terrorist bombing as follows:
{{quote|Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person unlawfully and intentionally delivers, places, discharges or detonates an explosive or other lethal device in, into or against a place of public use, a State or government facility, a public transportation system or an infrastructure facility:
:a) With the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury; or
:b) With the intent to cause extensive destruction of such a place, facility or system, where such a destruction results in or is likely to result in major economic loss.&lt;ref&gt;Terrorist Bombings Convention [http://treaties.un.org/doc/db/Terrorism/english-18-9.pdf art. 2.1].
&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Article 19 expressly excluded from the scope of the convention certain activities of state [[armed forces]] and of [[self-determination]] movements as follows:
{{quote|1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect other rights, obligations and responsibilities of States, and individuals under international law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and international humanitarian law.
2. The activities of armed forces during an armed conflict, as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law, are not governed by this Convention, and the activities undertaken by the military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, inasmuch as they are governed by other rules of international law, are not governed by this Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Terrorist Bombings Convention [http://treaties.un.org/doc/db/Terrorism/english-18-9.pdf art. 19].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Terrorist Financing Convention====
Article 2.1 of the 1999 sectoral United Nations [[International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism]] (Terrorist Financing Convention) defines the crime of terrorist financing as the offence committed by "any person" who "by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and wilfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out" an act "intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act."

====Nuclear Terrorism Convention====
The 2005 United Nations [[International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism]] defines the crime of nuclear terrorism as follows:
{{quote|Article 2
1. Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person unlawfully and intentionally:
(a) Possesses [[radioactive material]] or makes or possesses a device:
:(i) With the intent to cause death or serious bodily [[injury]]; or
:(ii) With the intent to cause substantial damage to property or to the [[Natural environment|environment]];
(b) Uses in any way radioactive material or a device, or uses or damages a nuclear facility in a manner which releases or risks the release of radioactive material:
:(i) With the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury; or
:(ii) With the intent to cause substantial damage to property or to the environment; or
:(iii) With the intent to compel a natural or legal person, an [[international organization]] or a State to do or refrain from doing an act.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Terrorism Convention, [http://treaties.un.org/doc/db/Terrorism/english-18-15.pdf art. 2].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Article 4 of the convention expressly excluded from the application of the convention the use of [[nuclear weapon]]s during [[armed conflict]]s without, though, recognizing the legality of the use of those weapons:
{{quote|1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect other rights, obligations and responsibilities of States and individuals under international law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international humanitarian law.

2. The activities of [[armed forces]] during an armed conflict, as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law are not governed by this Convention, and the activities undertaken by [[military]] forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, inasmuch as they are governed by other rules of international law, are not governed by this Convention.

3. The provisions of paragraph 2 of the present article shall not be interpreted as condoning or making lawful otherwise unlawful acts, or precluding prosecution under other laws.

4. This Convention does not address, nor can it be interpreted as addressing, in any way, the issue of the [[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons|legality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons]] by States.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Terrorism Convention, [http://treaties.un.org/doc/db/Terrorism/english-18-15.pdf art. 4].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Definitions of terrorism in other UN decisions===
In parallel with the criminal law [[codification (law)|codification]] efforts, some [[United Nations System|United Nations organs]] have put forward some broad political definitions of terrorism.

====UN General Assembly Resolutions====
A 1996 non-binding United Nations Declaration to Supplement the 1994 Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism, annexed to the UN General Assembly Resolution 51/210, described terrorist activities in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/51/a51r210.htm|title=A/RES/51/210.  Measures to eliminate international terrorism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.}}

[[Antonio Cassese]] has argued that the language of this and other similar UN declarations "sets out an acceptable definition of terrorism."&lt;ref name = "Cassese"&gt;Cassese (2002),  p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

====UN Security Council====
In 2004, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1566]] condemned terrorist acts as:
{{quote|criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the purpose to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons, intimidate a population or compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act, which constitute offences within the scope of and as defined in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism, are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other similar nature.}}

====The High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change and the Secretary General====
Also in 2004, a [[High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change]] composed of independent experts and convened by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] called states to set aside their differences and to adopt, in the text of a proposed [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]], the following political "description of terrorism":
{{quote|any action, in addition to actions already specified by the existing conventions on aspects of terrorism, the Geneva Conventions and Security Council resolution 1566 (2004), that is intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to [[civilians]] or [[non-combatants]], when the purpose of such an act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/peacebuilding/pdf/historical/hlp_more_secure_world.pdf Report of the High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change "A more secure world: Our shared responsibility"] (2004) para. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following year, Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Kofi Annan]] endorsed the High Level Panel's definition of terrorism and asked states to set aside their differences and to adopt that definition within the proposed comprehensive terrorism convention before the end of that year. He said:
{{quote|It is time to set aside debates on so-called "State terrorism". The use of force by states is already thoroughly regulated under international law. And the right to resist occupation must be understood in its true meaning. It cannot include the right to deliberately kill or maim civilians. I endorse fully the High-level Panel's call for a definition of terrorism, which would make it clear that, in addition to actions already proscribed by existing conventions, any action constitutes terrorism if it is intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a Government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act. I believe this proposal has clear moral force, and I strongly urge world leaders to unite behind it and to conclude a comprehensive convention on terrorism before the end of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, Secretary General, Report of the Secretary-General ''In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all''  [https://www.un.org/largerfreedom/chap3.htm Chapter 3] (2005) para. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The suggestion of incorporating this definition of terrorism into the comprehensive convention was rejected. Some [[List of United Nations member states|United Nations' member states]] contended that a definition such as the one proposed by the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, and endorsed by the Secretary General, lacked the necessary requirements to be incorporated in a [[criminal law]] instrument. Carlos Diaz-Paniagua, who coordinated the [[negotiation]]s of the proposed [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]], stated that a comprehensive definition of terrorism to be included in a criminal law [[treaty]] must have "legal precision, certainty, and fair-labeling of the criminal conduct - all of which emanate from the basic human rights obligation to observe due process."&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Barnidge, ''Non-State Actors and Terrorism: Applying the Law of State Responsibility and the Due Diligence Principle'' 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The [[European Union]] defines terrorism for legal/official purposes in Art. 1 of the ''Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism'' (2002).&lt;ref name = "StateWatch"&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2002/jul/frameterr622en00030007.pdf State Watch].&lt;/ref&gt; This provides that terrorist offences are certain criminal offences set out in a list consisting largely of serious offences against persons and property that;
{{quote|...given their nature or context, may seriously damage a country or an international organisation where committed with the aim of: seriously intimidating a population; or unduly compelling a Government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act; or seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or an international organisation.}}

===North Atlantic Treaty Organization===
[[NATO]] defines terrorism in the AAP-06 NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions, Edition 2014 as "The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence against individuals or property in an attempt to coerce or intimidate governments or societies to achieve political, religious or ideological objectives".&lt;ref&gt;http://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/ap/aap6/AAP-6.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The now lapsed [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] specified the following definition of terrorism:

{{quote|Whoever with intent to overawe the Government as by law established or to strike terror in the people or any section of the people or to alienate any section of the people or to adversely affect the harmony amongst different sections of the people does any act or thing by using bombs, dynamite or other explosive substances or inflammable substances or lethal weapons or poisons or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances (whether biological or otherwise) of a hazardous nature in such a manner as to cause, or as is likely to cause, death of, or injuries to, any person or persons or loss of, or damage to, or destruction of, property or disruption of any supplies or services essential to the life of the community, or detains any person and threatens to kill or injure such person in order to compel the Government or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act, commits a terrorist act.}}

===Pakistan===
The Pakistan Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Ordinance, 1999 states:

A person is said to commit a terrorist act if he,

(a) in order to, or if the effect of his actions will be to, strike terror or create a sense of fear and insecurity in the people, or any section of the people, does any act or thing by using bombs, dynamite or other explosive or inflammable substances, or such fire-arms or other lethal weapons as may be notified, or poisons or noxious gases or chemicals, in such a manner as to cause, or be likely to cause, the death of, or injury to, any person or persons, or damage to, or destruction of, property on a large scale, or a widespread disruption of supplies of services essential to the life of the community, or threatens with the use of force public servants in order to prevent them from discharging their lawful duties; or

===United States===
{{See also|Domestic terrorism in the United States}}

====U.S. Code (U.S.C.)====
Title 22, Chapter 38 of the United States Code (regarding the [[U.S. Department of State|Department of State]]) contains a definition of terrorism in its requirement that annual country reports on terrorism be submitted by the [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] to [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] every year. It reads:
{{quote|[T]he term 'terrorism' means [[premeditated]], politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2656f-|title=22 U.S. Code § 2656f - Annual country reports on terrorism|work=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Title 18 of the United States Code]] (regarding criminal acts and criminal procedure) defines international terrorism as:
{{quote|(1) [T]he term 'international terrorism' means activities that — 
:(A) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the [[Criminal law of the United States|criminal laws of the United States]] or of any State, or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any State; 
:(B) appear to be intended — 
:: (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;
:: (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or 
:: (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, [[assassination]], or [[kidnapping]]; and 
:(C) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2331-|title=18 U.S. Code § 2331 - Definitions|work=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Commenting on the genesis of this provision, [[Edward Peck (American diplomat)|Edward Peck]], former U.S. Chief of Mission in [[Iraq]] (under [[Jimmy Carter]]) and former ambassador to [[Mauritania]] said:
{{quote| In 1985, when I was the Deputy Director of the Reagan White House Task Force on Terrorism, [my working group was asked] to come up with a definition of terrorism that could be used throughout the government. We produced about six, and each and every case, they were rejected, because careful reading would indicate that our own country had been involved in some of those activities. […] After the task force concluded its work, Congress [passed] U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2331 ... the US definition of terrorism. […] one of the terms, "international terrorism," means "activities that," I quote, "appear to be intended to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping." […] Yes, well, certainly, you can think of a number of countries that have been involved in such activities. Ours is one of them. […] And so, the terrorist, of course, is in the eye of the beholder.&lt;ref name="DemocracyNow"&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/07/28/1440244 Democracy Now] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060731140522/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F07%2F28%2F1440244 |date=2006-07-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====U.S. Code of Federal Regulations====
The U.S. [[Code of Federal Regulations]] defines terrorism as "the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives" (28 C.F.R. Section 0.85).

====U.S. Department of Defense====
The [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] recently changed its definition of terrorism. Per Joint Pub 3-07.2, ''Antiterrorism,'' (24 November 2010), the Department of Defense defines it as "the unlawful use of violence or threat of violence to instill fear and coerce governments or societies. Terrorism is often motivated by religious, political, or other ideological beliefs and committed in the pursuit of goals that are usually political."

The new definition distinguishes between motivations for terrorism (religion, ideology, etc.) and goals of terrorism ("usually political"). This is in contrast to the previous definition which stated that the goals could be religious in nature.

====U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency====
The U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) contains a definition of terrorism, which reads:

{{quote|Terrorism is the use of force or violence against persons or property in violation of the criminal laws of the United States for purposes of intimidation, coercion, or [[ransom]]. Terrorists often use threats to:
* Create fear among the public.
* Try to convince citizens that their government is powerless to prevent terrorism.
* Get immediate publicity for their causes.}}

The new definition does not require that the act needs to be politically motivated. The FEMA also said that terrorism "include threats of terrorism; assassinations; kidnappings; [[hijacking (disambiguation)|hijacking]]s; [[Bomb threat|bomb scare]]s and [[bomb]]ings; [[cyber attack]]s (computer-based); and the use of [[chemical weapon|chemical]], [[biological weapon|biological]], [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] and [[radiological weapon]]s" and also states that "[h]igh-risk targets for acts of terrorism include military and civilian government facilities, [[international airport]]s, large [[City|cities]], and high-profile [[landmark]]s. Terrorists might also target large public gatherings, water and food supplies, utilities, and corporate centers. Further, terrorists are capable of spreading fear by sending [[explosives]] or chemical and biological agents through the mail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1549-20490-0802/terrorism.pdf|title=Federal Emergency Management Agency — Terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. National Counterterrorism Center====
The U.S. [[National Counterterrorism Center]] (NCTC) define terrorism the same as United States Code 22 USC § 2656f(d)(2). The Center also defines a terrorist act as a "premeditated; perpetrated by a sub-national or clandestine agent; politically motivated, potentially including religious, philosophical, or culturally symbolic motivations; violent; and perpetrated against a non-combatant target."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghri.org/GHR-International%20Definitions.htm|title=GHR International Definitions|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422010111/http://www.ghri.org/GHR-International%20Definitions.htm|archivedate=2009-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. national security strategy====
In September 2002, the U.S. national security strategy defined terrorism as "premeditated, politically motivated violence against innocents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward P. |last=Halibozek |first2=Andy |last2=Jones |first3=Gerald L. |last3=Kovacich |year=2007 |title=The corporate security professional's handbook on terrorism |edition=illustrated |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=0-7506-8257-4 |page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qpwcHUNXw-kC&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition did not exclude actions by the United States government and it was qualified some months later with "premeditated, politically motivated violence against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tom |last=Rockmore|first2=Joseph |last2=Margolis |first3=Armen |last3=Marsoobian|year=2005 |title=The philosophical challenge of September 11: Metaphilosophy |volume=35|number=3 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=1-4051-0893-2 |page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Crs1bGcjAp8C&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====USA PATRIOT Act of 2001====
The [[Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act of 2001]] defines domestic terrorism as "activities that (A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the U.S. or of any state; (B) appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S."

====Terrorism Risk Insurance Act====
Section 102(1)(a) of the [[Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]] contains a definition of terrorism in order for insurance companies to provide coverage to all prospective policy holders at time of purchase and to all current policyholders at renewal and requires that the federal government pay 90 percent of covered terrorism losses exceeding the statutorily established deductible paid by the insurance company providing the coverage. It reads:
{{quote|(1) ACT OF TERRORISM-
::(A) CERTIFICATION- The term 'act of terrorism' means any act that is certified by the [[U.S. Secretary of Treasury|Secretary [of Treasury]]], in concurrence with the Secretary of State, and the [[Attorney General of the United States]]--

==In general insurance policies==
Some insurance companies exclude terrorism from general property insurance (e.g. [[home insurance]]). An insurance company may include a specific definition of terrorism as part of its policy, for the purpose of excluding at least some loss or damage caused by terrorism. For example, [[RAC Insurance]] in Australia defines terrorism thus:
{{quote|
''terrorism'' – includes but is not limited to the use of force or violence and/or threat, by any person or group of persons done for or in connection with political, religious, ideological or similar purposes including the intention to influence any government and/or to put the public, or any section of the public, in fear.

==Social==
As [[Bruce Hoffman]] has noted: "terrorism is a pejorative term. It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one's enemies and opponents, or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore. (...) Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization 'terrorist' becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned. If one identifies with the victim of the violence, for example, then the act is terrorism. If, however, one identifies with the perpetrator, the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic, if not positive (or, at the worst, an ambivalent) light; and it is not terrorism."&lt;ref name="Hoffman-1998-p23"/&gt; For this and for political reasons, many news sources (such as [[Reuters]]) avoid using this term, opting instead for less accusatory words like "bombers", "militants", etc.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/citydiary/2735455/City-Diary.html  City Diary: Reuters sticks to the facts], City Diary, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 28 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=O6QTfAkk22AC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Definitions+of+terrorism&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Definitions%20of%20terrorism&amp;f=false pp. 28&amp;ndash;30]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of political definitions==
Listed below are some of the historically important understandings of terror and terrorism, and enacted but non-universal definitions of the term:
&lt;!-- Listed oldest to newest --&gt;
* '''1795'''. "Government intimidation during the Reign of Terror in France." The general sense of "systematic use of terror as a policy" was first recorded in English in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/terrorism|title=Terrorism - Define Terrorism at Dictionary.com|date=|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

League of Nations convention language: "All criminal acts directed against a State and intended or calculated to create a state of terror in the minds of particular persons or a group of persons or the general public."&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9nH0kSUMwGIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Criminology|date=|work=google.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1987'''. A definition proposed by Iran at an international Islamic conference on terrorism: "Terrorism is an act carried out to achieve an inhuman and corrupt ''(mufsid)'' objective, and involving [a] threat to security of any kind, and violation of rights acknowledged by religion and mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justresponse.net/defining_terrorism.html|title=JUST Response - Ayatollah Taskhiri - Definition of terrorism|date=|work=justresponse.net|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1988'''. A proposed academic consensus definition: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Terrorism is an anxiety-inspiring method of repeated violent action, employed by (semi-) clandestine individual, group or state actors, for idiosyncratic, criminal or political reasons, whereby - in contrast to assassination - the direct targets of violence are not the main targets. The immediate human victims of violence are generally chosen randomly (targets of opportunity) or selectively (representative or symbolic targets) from a target population, and serve as message generators.&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{cite web

* '''2003'''. India: Referencing Schmid's 1992 proposal, the [[Supreme Court of India]] described terrorist acts as the "peacetime equivalents of war crimes."&lt;ref&gt;Schmid's definition of terrorism was adopted in a 2003 ruling (Madan Singh vs. State of Bihar); See http://www.sacw.net/hrights/judgementjehanabad.doc&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2005'''. [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s statement with relation to terrorism: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.{{cn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* '''2008'''. Carsten Bockstette, a German military officer serving at the [[George C. Marshall Center for European Security Studies]], proposed the following definition: "political violence in an [[asymmetrical conflict]] that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear (sometimes indiscriminate) through the violent [[victimisation|victimization]] and destruction of [[noncombatant]] [[Targeting (warfare)|targets]] (sometimes iconic symbols)."&lt;ref name=Bockstette2008&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bockstette, Carsten | year = 2008 | title = Jihadist Terrorist Use of Strategic Communication Management Techniques | issue = 20 | url = http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_ResearchProgram/occPapers/occ-paper_20-en.pdf | accessdate = 2009-01-01 | journal = George C.

* '''2014'''. Contained in a Saudi Arabia terrorism law taking effect 1 February 2014, the following definition has been criticized by [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] for being overly broad:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any act carried out by an offender in furtherance of an individual or collective project, directly or indirectly, intended to disturb the public order of the state, or to shake the security of society, or the stability of the state, or to expose its national unity to danger, or to suspend the basic law of governance or some of its articles, or to insult the reputation of the state or its position, or to inflict damage upon one of its public utilities or its natural resources, or to attempt to force a governmental authority to carry out or prevent it from carrying out an action, or to threaten to carry out acts that lead to the named purposes or incite [these acts].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/02/06/saudi-arabia-terrorism-law-tramples-rights|work=Human Rights Watch| title=Saudi Arabia: Terrorism Law Tramples on Rights| first=Joe|last=Stork|date=February 6, 2014|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/saudi-arabia-new-terrorism-law-one-more-tool-crush-peaceful-protest-2014-02-03| work=Amnesty International|title=Saudi Arabia: New terrorism law is latest tool to crush peaceful expression|date=February 3, 2014|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Scholars and recognized experts on terrorism==
Numerous scholars have proposed working definitions of terrorism.  [[Bruce Hoffman]], a well-known scholar, has thus noted that:
{{quote|It is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism. Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus. In the first edition of his magisterial survey, "Political terrorism: A Research Guide," Alex Schmid devoted more than a hundred pages to examining more than a hundred different definition of terrorism in a effort to discover a broadly acceptable, reasonably comprehensive explication of the word. Four years and a second edition later, Schimd was no closer to the goal of his quest, conceding in the first sentence of the revised volume that the "search for an adequate definition is still on" Walter Laqueur despaired of defining terrorism in both editions of his monumental work on the subject, maintaining that it is neither possible to do so nor worthwhile to make the attempt. "Ten years of debates on typologies and definitions,"  he responded to a survey on definitions to conducted by Schmid, "have not enhanced our knowledge of the subject to a significant degree." Laqueur's contention is supported by the twenty-two different word categories occurring in the 109 different definition that Schmid identified in survey. At the end of this exhaustive exercise, Schmid asks "whether the above list contains all the elements necessary for a good definition. The answer," he suggests" is probably 'no'."  If it is impossible to define terrorism, as Laqueur argues, and fruitless to attempt to cobble together a truly comprehensive definition, as Schmid admits, are we to conclude that terrorism is impervious to precise, much less accurate definition? Not entirely. If we cannot define terrorism, then we can at least usefully distinguish it from other types of violence and identify the characteristics that make terrorism the distinct phenomenon of political violence that it is.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hoffman believes it is possible to identify some key characteristics of terrorism. He proposes that:
[[File:Iraq-terrorist attack on buses.jpg|thumb|The [[Baghdad]] bus station was the scene of a triple [[17 August 2005 Baghdad bombings|car bombing in August 2005]] that killed 43 people.]]
{{quote|By distinguishing terrorists from other types of criminals and terrorism from other forms of crime, we come to appreciate that terrorism is:
* ineluctably political in aims and motives;
* violent – or, equally important, threatens violence;
* designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target;
* conducted either by an organization with an identifiable chain of command or conspiratorial cell structure (whose members wear no uniform or identifying insignia) or by individuals or a small collection of individuals directly influenced, motivated, or inspired by the ideological aims or example of some existent terrorist movement and/or its leaders;
and
* perpetrated by a subnational group or nonstate entity.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside Terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;}}


A definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the [[George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies]], underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism:

{{quote|Terrorism is defined as political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear (sometimes indiscriminate) through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets (sometimes iconic symbols). Such acts are meant to send a message from an illicit clandestine organization. The purpose of terrorism is to exploit the media in order to achieve maximum attainable publicity as an amplifying force multiplier in order to influence the targeted audience(s) in order to reach short- and midterm political goals and/or desired long-term end states.&lt;ref name=Bockstette2008/&gt;}}

In this sense, after surveying the various academic definitions of terrorism, Vallis concluded that:
{{quote|Most of the formal definitions of terrorism have some common characteristics: a fundamental motive to make political/societal changes; the use of violence or illegal force; attacks on civilian targets by 'nonstate'/'Subnational actors'; and the goal of affecting society. This finding is reflected in Blee's listing of three components of terrorism:
# Acts or threats of violence;
# The communication of fear to an audience beyond the immediate victim, and;
# Political, economic, or religious aims by the perpetrator(s).&lt;ref&gt;Rhyll Vallis, Yubin Yang, Hussein A. Abbass, [http://www.itee.adfa.edu.au/~alar/techreps/200611015.pdf Disciplinary Approaches to Terrorism: A Survey], University of South Wales, p. 7. For similar surveys see also: Hoffman, Bruce ''Inside terrorism'', 2 ed. Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 34; and Alex Schmid, Statistics on Terrorism: The Challenge of Measuring Trends in Global Terrorism" in ''Forum on Crime and Society'', v. 4, N. 1-2 (2004) pp. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Academics and practitioners may also be categorized by the definitions of terrorism that they use. [[Max Abrahms]] has introduced the distinction between what he calls "terrorist lumpers" and "terrorist splitters."  Lumpers define terrorism broadly, brooking no distinction between this tactic and guerrilla warfare or civil war.  Terrorist splitters, by contrast, define terrorism narrowly, as the select use of violence against civilians for putative political gain.  As Abrahms notes, these two definitions yield different policy implications:
{{quote|Lumpers invariably believe that terrorism is a winning tactic for coercing major government concessions. As evidence, they point to substate campaigns directed against military personnel that have indeed pressured concessions. Salient examples include the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, the U.S. withdrawal from Lebanon in 1984, and the French withdrawal from Algeria in 1962. Significantly, terrorist splitters do not regard these substate campaigns as evidence of terrorism's political effectiveness. Rather, they contend that disaggregating substate campaigns directed against civilian targets versus military ones is critical for appreciating terrorism's abysmal political record.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahms, Max. "Lumpers versus Splitters: A Pivotal Battle in the Field of Terrorism Studies." Cato. http://www.cato-unbound.org/2010/02/10/max-abrahms/lumpers-versus-splitters-a-pivotal-battle-in-the-field-of-terrorism-studies/.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* ineluctably political in aims and motives
* violent—or, equally important, threatens violence
* designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target
* conducted by an organization with an identifiable chain of command or conspiratorial cell structure (whose members wear no uniform or identifying insignia) and
* perpetrated by a subnational group or non-state entity.
We may therefore now attempt to define terrorism as the deliberate creation and exploitation of fear through violence or the threat of violence in the pursuit of political change. All terrorist acts involve violence or the threat of violence. Terrorism is specifically designed to have far-reaching psychological effects beyond the immediate victim(s) or object of the terrorist attack. It is meant to instil fear within, and thereby intimidate, a wider 'target audience' that might include a rival ethnic or religious group, an entire country, a national government or political party, or public opinion in general. Terrorism is designed to create power where there is none or to consolidate power where there is very little. Through the publicity generated by their violence, terrorists seek to obtain the leverage, influence and power they otherwise lack to effect political change on either a local or an international scale."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[philosophy of language]], the '''descriptivist theory of proper names''' (also '''descriptivist theory of reference''')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/frege/ Frege, Gottlob – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; is the view that the meaning or semantic content of a [[Proper name (philosophy)|proper name]] is identical to the descriptions associated with it by speakers, while their referents are determined to be the objects that satisfy these descriptions. [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Gottlob Frege]] have both been associated with the descriptivist theory, which is sometimes called the [[Frege–Russell view]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul Kripke]], ''[[Naming and Necessity]]''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1972. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, this theory came under attack from [[causal theory of reference|causal theorists]] such as [[Saul Kripke]], [[Hilary Putnam]] and others. However, it has seen something of a revival in recent years, especially under the form of what are called [[two-dimensionalism|two-dimensional]] semantic theories. This latter trend is exemplified by the theories of [[David Chalmers]], among others.

==The descriptive theory and its merits==

A simple descriptivist theory of names can be thought of as follows: for every proper name ''p'', there is some collection of descriptions ''D'' associated with ''p'' that constitute the meaning of ''p''.  For example, the descriptivist may hold that the proper name ''[[Saul Kripke]]'' is synonymous with the collection of descriptions such as 
# the man who wrote ''[[Naming and Necessity]]''
# a person who was born on November 13, 1940 in [[Bay Shore]], [[New York (state)|New York]]
# the son of a leader of Beth El Synagogue in [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]]
: etc ...
The descriptivist takes the meaning of the name ''Saul Kripke'' to be that collection of descriptions and takes the referent of the name to be the thing that satisfies all or most of those descriptions.

A simple descriptivist theory may further hold that the meaning of a sentence ''S'' that contains ''p'' is given by the collection of sentences produced by replacing each instance of ''p'' in ''S'' with one of the descriptions in ''D''.  So, the sentence such as "Saul Kripke stands next to a table" has the same meaning as the following collection of sentences:
# The man who wrote ''Naming and Necessity'' stands next to a table.
# A person who was born on November 13, 1940 in Bay Shore, New York stands next to a table.
# The son of a leader of Beth El Synagogue in Omaha, Nebraska stands next to a table.
: etc ...

A version of descriptivism was formulated by Frege in reaction to problems with his original theory of meaning or reference (''Bedeutung''), which entailed that sentences with empty proper names cannot have a meaning. Yet a sentence containing the name 'Odysseus' is intelligible, and therefore has a sense, even though there is no individual object (its reference) to which the name corresponds. Also, the sense of different names is different, even when their reference is the same. Frege said that if an identity statement such as "[[Hesperus]] is the same planet as [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]" is to be informative, the proper names flanking the identity sign must have a different meaning or sense. But clearly, if the statement is true, they must have the same reference.&lt;ref&gt;G. Frege, "Über Sinn und Bedeutung", ''Zeitschrift für Philosophie und philosophische Kritik'', vol. 100 (1892), pp. 25–50, esp. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The sense is a 'mode of presentation', which serves to illuminate only a single aspect of the referent.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars disagree as to whether Frege intended such modes of presentation to be descriptions. See the article [[Sense and reference]].

Russell’s approach is somewhat different. First of all, Russell makes an important distinction between what he calls “ordinary” proper names and “logically” proper names. Logically proper names are indexicals such as ''this'' and ''that'', which directly refer (in a [[Millianism|Millian]] sense) to sense-data or other objects of immediate acquaintance.  For Russell, ordinary proper names are ''abbreviated definite descriptions.'' Here definite description refers again to the type of formulation “The…” which was used above to describe Santa Claus as “the benevolent, bearded….’’ According to Russell, the name “Aristotle” is just a sort of shorthand for a definite description such as “The last great philosopher of ancient Greece” or “The teacher of Alexander the great” or some conjunction of two or more such descriptions. Now, according to Russell’s [[theory of descriptions|theory of definite descriptions]], such descriptions must, in turn, be reduced, to a certain very specific logical form of existential generalization as follows:

*"The king of France is bald".
becomes
*&lt;math&gt; \exists x (K(x) \land \forall y (K(y) \rightarrow x=y) \land B(x)) &lt;/math&gt;

This says that there is exactly one object ‘’x’’ such that ‘’x’’ is King of France and ‘’x’’ is bald. Notice that this formulation is entirely general: it says that there is some x out in the world that satisfies the description, but does not specify which one thing ‘’x’’ refers to. Indeed, for Russell, definite descriptions (and hence names) have no reference at all and their meanings (senses in the Fregean sense) are just the truth conditions of the logical forms illustrated above. This is made clearer by Russell’s example involving ‘’Bismarck’’:

*(G) ”The Chancellor of Germany...”

In this case, Russell suggests that only Bismarck himself can be in a relation of acquaintance such that the man himself enters into the proposition expressed by the sentence. For any other than Bismarck, the only relation that is possible with such a proposition is through its descriptions. Bismarck could never have existed and the sentence (G) would still be meaningful because of its general nature described by the logical form underlying the sentence.

Notwithstanding these differences however, descriptivism and the descriptive theory of proper names came to be associated with both the views of Frege and Russell and both address the general problems (names without bearers, Frege’s puzzles concerning identity and substitution in contexts of intentional attitude attributions) in a similar manner.

Another problem for Millianism is Frege’s famous puzzles concerning the identity of co-referring terms. For example:

*(V) ”Hesperus is Phosphorus.”

In this case, both terms (“Hesperus” and “Phosphorus”) refer to the same entity: Venus. The Millian theory would predict that this sentence is trivial, since meaning is just reference and “Venus is Venus” is not very informative. Suppose, however, that someone did not know that Hesperus and Phosphorus both referred to Venus. Then it is at least arguable that the sentence (V) is an attempt to inform someone of just this fact.

Another problem for Millianism is that of statements such as “Fred believes that Cicero, but not Tully, was Roman.”

== Kripke’s objections and the causal theory==

In his book ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'',  [[Saul Kripke]] criticised the descriptivist theory. At the end of Lecture I (pp.&amp;nbsp;64–70) Kripke sets out what he believes to be the tenets of the descriptivist theory. Kripke formally states a number of theses as the core of the descriptivist theory, with these theses explaining the theory in terms of reference (rather than the sense or meaning). As he explains before stating the theory, "There are more theses if you take it in the stronger version as a theory of meaning" (p.&amp;nbsp;64).

As he states it, the descriptivist theory is "weaker," i.e., the claims it makes do not assert as much as a stronger theory would. This actually makes it harder to refute. The descriptivist theory of meaning would include these theses and definitions however, thus refuting these would suffice for refuting the descriptivist theory of meaning as well. Kripke formulates them as follows:

# To every name or designating expression 'X', there corresponds a cluster of properties, namely the family of those properties φ such that [speaker] A believes 'φX'
# One of the properties, or some conjointly, are believed by A to pick out some individual uniquely.
# If most, or a weighted most, of the φ's are satisfied by one unique object y, then y is the referent of 'X'. 
# If the vote yields no unique object, 'X' does not refer. 
# The statement, 'If X exists, then X has most of the φ's [corresponding to X]' is known ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' by the speaker.
# The statement, 'If X exists, then X has most of the φ's [corresponding to X]' expresses a necessary truth (in the idiolect of the speaker).&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. Naming and Necessity. Basil Blackwell. Boston. 1980. (p. 71)&lt;/ref&gt;

(1) States the properties or concepts related to any given proper name, where a name 'X' has a set of properties associated with it. The set of properties are those that a speaker, on inquiry of "Who is Barack Obama?" would respond "The President of the U.S., former Senator of Illinois, husband of Michelle Obama, etc." (1) does not stipulate that the set of properties φ is the meaning of X. (2) stipulates the epistemic position of the speaker. Note (2) says "believed by A to pick out".

(3) Takes the properties in (1) and (2) and turns them into a mechanism of reference. Basically, if a unique object satisfies the properties associated with 'X' such that A believes that 'X has such-and-such properties', it picks out or refers to that object. (4) states what happens when no object satisfies the properties (Kripke talks in terms of taking a "vote" as to the unique referent).

(5) [[Logical consequence|Follows from]] (1)-(3). If there is a set of properties that speaker A believes to be associated with X, then these properties must be already known by the speaker. In this sense they are a priori. To know what a bachelor is, an individual must know what an unmarried male is; likewise an individual must know who is 'The President of the U.S., former Senator of Illinois, husband of Michelle Obama, etc.' to know who Obama is.
(6) However is not a direct product of the theses. Kripke notes "(6) need not be a thesis of the theory if someone doesn't think that the cluster is part of the meaning of the name" (p.&amp;nbsp;65). However, when the descriptivist theory is taken as a theory of reference and meaning, (6) would be a thesis.

Taken as a theory of reference, the following would be true:
* If someone fits the description 'the author who wrote, among other things, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'' and ''[[Animal Farm]]''' uniquely, then this someone is the [[George Orwell]]. (Thesis 3)
* 'George Orwell wrote, among other things, ''1984'' and ''Animal Farm''' is known a priori by the speaker. (Thesis 5)

The idea in the second sentence is that one can't refer to something without knowing what he or she is referring to. 
Taken as a theory of reference and meaning, the following would be true:

* The author who wrote, among other things, ''1984'' and ''Animal Farm'', wrote ''1984'' and ''Animal Farm''. (Thesis 6)

After breaking down the descriptivist theory, he begins to point out what's wrong with it. First, he offered up what has come to be known as “the modal argument” (or argument from rigidity) against descriptivism. Consider the name ‘’Aristotle’’ and the descriptions “the greatest student of Plato’’, “the founder of logic” and “the teacher of Alexander.” Aristotle obviously satisfies all of the descriptions (and many of the others we commonly associate with him), but it is not a [[logical truth|necessary truth]] that if Aristotle existed then Aristotle was any one, or all, of these descriptions, contrary to thesis (6). Aristotle might well have existed without doing any single one of the things he is known for. He might have existed and not have become known to posterity at all or he might have died in infancy.

Suppose that Aristotle is associated by Mary with the description
“the last great philosopher of antiquity” and (the actual) Aristotle died in infancy. Then Mary’s description would seem to refer to Plato. But this is deeply counterintuitive. Hence, names are ‘’rigid designators’’, according to Kripke. That is, they refer to the same individual in every possible world in which that individual exists.

This is the counterintuitive result of thesis (6). For descriptivists Aristotle means “the greatest student of Plato’’, “the founder of logic” and “the teacher of Alexander.” So the sentence “the greatest student of Plato, etc., was the greatest student of Plato,” is equivalent to “Aristotle was the greatest student of Plato, etc.” Of course a sentence like “x=x” is necessary, but this just isn't the case with proper names and their descriptions. Aristotle could have done something else, thus he is not necessarily identical to his description.

The second argument employed by Kripke has come to be called the ‘’epistemic argument” or “the argument from unwanted necessity.” This is simply the observation that if the meaning of ‘’Angela Merkel’’ is “the Chancellor of Germany”, then “Angela is the Chancellor of Germany” should seem to the average person to be a priori, analytic, and trivial, as if falling out of the meaning of “Angela Merkel” just as “unmarried male” falls out of the meaning of “bachelor.” If thesis (5) is to hold, the properties of Angela Merkel should be known a priori by the speaker. But this is not true. We had to go out into the world to see who the Chancellor of Germany is.

Kripke’s third argument against descriptive theories consisted in pointing out that people may associate inadequate or inaccurate descriptions with proper names. Kripke uses [[Kurt Gödel]] as an example. The only thing most people know about Gödel is that he proved the incompleteness of arithmetic. Suppose he hadn't proved it, and really he stole it from his friend Schmidt. Thesis (3) says that if most of the properties associated with 'Gödel' are satisfied by one unique object, in this case Schmidt, then Schmidt is the referent of 'Gödel.' This means that every time someone (in the world where Gödel stole the incompleteness theorem from Schmidt) says 'Gödel' he or she is actually referring to Schmidt. This is far too counter-intuitive for the descriptivist theory to hold.

Such arguments seem to have convinced the majority of philosophers of language to abandon descriptive theories of proper names.

==Revival of descriptivism and two-dimensionalism==

In recent years, there has been something of a revival in descriptivist theories, including descriptivist theories of proper names. Metalinguistic description theories have been developed and adopted by such contemporary theorists as [[Kent Bach]] and [[Jerrold Katz]]. According to Katz, “metalinguistic description theories explicate the sense of proper nouns - but not common nouns - in terms of a relation between the noun and the objects that bear its name.” Differently from the traditional theory, such theories do not posit a need for sense to determine reference and the metalinguistic description mentions the name it is the sense of (hence it is "metalinguistic") while placing no conditions on being the bearer of a name. Katz's theory, to take this example, is based on the fundamental idea that sense should not have to be defined in terms of, nor determine, referential or extensional properties but that it should be defined in terms of, and determined by, all and only the intensional properties of names.

He illustrates the way a metalinguistic description theory can be successful against Kripkean counterexamples by citing, as one example, the case of ‘’Jonah’’. Kripke’s Jonah case is very powerful because in this case the only information that we have about the Biblical character Jonah is just what the Bible tells us. Unless we are fundamentalist literalists, it is not controversial that all of this is false. Since, under traditional descriptivism, these descriptions are what define the name Jonah; these descriptivists must say that Jonah did not exist. But this does not follow. But under Katz's version of descriptivism, the sense of Jonah contains no information derived from the Biblical accounts but contains only the term "Jonah" itself in the phrase "the thing that is a bearer of 'Jonah'." Hence, it is not vulnerable to these kinds of counterexamples.

The most common and challenging criticism to metalinguistic description theories was put forth by Kripke himself: they seem to be an ad hoc explanation of a single linguistic phenomenon. Why should there be a metalinguistic theory for proper nouns (like names) but not for common nouns, count nouns, verbs, predicates, indexicals and other parts of speech.

Another recent approach is ''two-dimensional semantics.'' The motivations for this approach are rather different from those that inspired other forms of descriptivism, however. Two–dimensional approaches are usually motivated by a sense of dissatisfaction with the causal theorist explanation of how it is that a single proposition can be both [[Logical truth|necessary]] and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' or [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''.

[[Image:Desertisland.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A desert island in [[Palau]]]]A '''deserted island''' or '''uninhabited island''' is an [[island]] that is not permanently populated by [[human]]s. Uninhabited islands are often used in movies or stories about [[shipwreck]]ed people, and are also used as stereotypes for the idea of "[[paradise]]". Some uninhabited islands are protected as [[nature reserve]]s and some are privately owned. [[Devon Island]] in [[Canada]] is claimed to be the largest uninhabited island in the world.

Small coral [[atolls]] or islands usually have no source of [[fresh water]], but at times a fresh water [[lens (hydrology)|lens]] ([[Ghyben–Herzberg lens]]) can be reached with a well.

==Terminology==
[[Image:LakshadweepIsland.jpg|thumb|One of the uninhabited islands in [[Lakshadweep]], India]]
Uninhabited islands are sometimes also called "deserted islands" or "desert islands". In the latter, the adjective "[[wikt:desert#Adjective|desert]]" connotes not [[desert]] climate conditions, but rather "desolate and sparsely occupied or unoccupied".  The word "desert" has been "formerly applied more widely to any wild, uninhabited region, including forest-land", and it is this archaic meaning that appears in the phrase "desert island".&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"desert, n.2". Oxford English Dictionary Online. June 2016. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/50774?redirectedFrom=desert+island (accessed June 14, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the term "deserted island" does not imply that the island was previously inhabited and later deserted.{{Citation needed|reason=claim is opinion|date=October 2018}}

The term "desert island" is also commonly used figuratively to refer to objects or behavior in conditions of social isolation and limited material means. Behavior on a desert island is a common [[thought experiment]], for example, "desert island morality".&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;

==In literature and popular culture==
The first known [[novel]]s to be set on a desert island were ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Philosophus Autodidactus]]'' written by [[Ibn Tufail]] (1105–1185), followed by ''[[Ibn al-Nafis#Theologus Autodidactus|Theologus Autodidactus]]'' written by [[Ibn al-Nafis]] (1213–1288). The [[protagonist]]s in both (Hayy in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' and Kamil in ''Theologus Autodidactus'') are [[feral child]]ren living in seclusion on a deserted island, until they eventually come in contact with [[castaway]]s from the outside world who are stranded on the island. The story of ''Theologus Autodidactus'', however, extends beyond the deserted island setting when the castaways take Kamil back to [[civilization]] with them.&lt;ref name=Roubi&gt;Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), "Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher", ''Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis'', Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ([[cf.]] [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibnul-Nafees As a Philosopher] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206072116/http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html |date=February 6, 2008 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World'').&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Shakespeare]]'s 1610–11 play, ''[[The Tempest]]'', uses the idea of being stranded on a desert island as a pretext for the action of the play. [[Prospero]] and his daughter [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]] are set adrift by Prospero's treacherous brother Antonio, seeking to become [[Duke of Milan]], and Prospero in turn shipwrecks his brother and other men of sin onto the island.

A [[Latin]] translation of Ibn Tufail's ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' appeared in 1671, prepared by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger,&lt;ref name=Amber&gt;Amber Haque (2004), "Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists", ''Journal of Religion and Health'' '''43''' (4): 357–377 [369].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2011}} followed by an [[English language|English]] translation by [[Simon Ockley]] in 1708,&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Ockley]] (1708), ''The Improvement of Human Reason: Exhibited in the Life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan'', [[Oxford University]].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translations.&lt;ref name=Wainwright&gt;Martin Wainwright, [http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,918454,00.html Desert island scripts], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 22 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 17th century, ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' inspired [[Robert Boyle]], an acquaintance of Pococke, to write his own philosophical novel set on a deserted island, ''The Aspiring Naturalist''.&lt;ref name=Toomer&gt;[[G. J. Toomer]] (1996), ''Eastern Wisedome and Learning: The Study of Arabic in Seventeenth-Century England'', p. 222, [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-820291-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn al-Nafis' ''Theologus Autodidactus'' was also eventually translated into English in the early 20th century.
[[File:Robinson Offterdinger 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Robinson Crusoe in an 1887 German illustration]]
Published in 1719, [[Daniel Defoe]]'s novel ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' about a castaway on a desert island has spawned so many imitations in film, television and radio that its name was used to define a genre, [[Robinsonade]].&lt;ref&gt;''Steampunk'' anthology, 2008, ed. [[Ann VanderMeer]] &amp; [[Jeff VanderMeer]], {{ISBN|978-1-892391-75-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Empire Islands: Castaways, Cannibals, And Fantasies of Conquest'', by Rebecca Weaver-Hightower, University of Minnesota P, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0816648634}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel features [[Friday (Robinson Crusoe)|Man Friday]], Crusoe's personal assistant. It is likely that Defoe took inspiration for Crusoe from a [[Scotland|Scottish]] sailor named [[Alexander Selkirk]], who was rescued in 1709 after four years on the otherwise uninhabited [[Juan Fernández Islands]]; Defoe usually made use of current events for his plots. It is also likely that he was inspired by the Latin or English translations of Ibn Tufail's ''Philosophus Autodidactus''.&lt;ref name=Amber/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wainwright/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nawal Muhammad Hassan (1980), ''Hayy bin Yaqzan and Robinson Crusoe: A study of an early Arabic impact on English literature'', Al-Rashid House for Publication.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Glasse (2001), ''New [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'', p. 202, Rowman Altamira, {{ISBN|0-7591-0190-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Neale]] was a New Zealander who voluntarily spent 16 years in three sessions in the 1950s and 1960s living alone on the island of [[Suwarrow]] in the northern [[Cook Islands]] group.  His time there is documented in his autobiography, ''An Island To Oneself''. Significant novels set on deserted islands include ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'', ''[[The Coral Island]]'', ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', ''[[The Cay (novel)|The Cay]]'' and ''[[The Beach (novel)|The Beach]]''. [[Juana Maria]], a Native American woman, was stranded for 18 years on [[San Nicolas Island]] off California in the 19th century.

The theme of being stranded on a desert island has inspired films, such as ''[[Cast Away]]'', and TV series, like ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and the comedy ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''. It is also the driving force behind [[reality show]]s like ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'' and the [[Discovery Kids]] show ''[[Flight 29 Down]]''.

In the popular conception, such islands are often located in the [[Pacific]], [[tropical]], uninhabited and usually uncharted. {{Citation needed|reason=Whose popular conception?|date=July 2014}}  They are remote locales that offer escape and force people marooned or stranded as [[castaway]]s to become self-sufficient and essentially create a new society. This society can either be [[utopian]], based on an ingenious re-creation of society's comforts (as in ''[[Swiss Family Robinson]]'' and, in a humorous form, ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'') or a regression into savagery (the major theme of both ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' and ''[[The Beach (novel)|The Beach]]'').  In reality, small coral [[atolls]] or islands usually have no source of [[fresh water]] (thus precluding any long-term human survival), but at times a [[fresh water]] lens ([[Ghyben–Herzberg lens]]) can be reached with a well.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

During the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic war]] depicted in [[H.G. Wells]]'s ''[[The War in the Air]]'', [[Goat Island (New York)|Goat Island]] in the middle of the [[Niagara Falls]] becomes abruptly a desert island when all bridges linking it to the mainland are destroyed - marooning a few survivors who embark on a bitter struggle for survival.

The [[BBC]] Radio 4 program ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' asks well-known people what items they would take with them to a deserted island. The program has inspired many similar articles, contests, and projects, including "desert island books," "desert island movies," and so on.

Some songs mention about desert islands, including one sung by [[Noel Paul Stookey]] from [[Peter, Paul and Mary]].

Desert islands are also a hugely popular image for [[gag cartoon]]s, the island being conventionally depicted as just a few yards across with a single palm tree (probably due to the visual constraints of the medium). 17 such cartoons appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 1957 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/05/history-of-the-desert-island-cartoon |title=A Guy, a Palm Tree, and a Desert Island: The Cartoon Genre That Just Won’t Die |author=Bruce Handy |date=May 25, 2012 |work=Vanity Fair |accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[message in a bottle]] is a form of communication often associated with people stranded on a deserted island attempting to be rescued.

{{Medical anthropology}}
A '''double bind''' is an emotionally distressing [[dilemma]] in [[communication]] in which an individual (or group) receives two or more conflicting messages, with one negating the other. This creates a situation in which a successful response to one message results in a failed response to the other (and vice versa), so that the person will automatically be wrong regardless of response.  The double bind occurs when the person cannot confront the inherent dilemma, and therefore can neither resolve it nor opt out of the situation.

Double bind theory was first described by [[Gregory Bateson]] and his colleagues in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="schizophrenia"&gt;Bateson, G., Jackson, D. D., Haley, J. &amp; Weakland, J., 1956, Toward a theory of schizophrenia.''Behavioral Science'', Vol. 1, 251–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Double binds are often utilized as a form of control without open coercion—the use of confusion makes them both difficult to respond to as well as to resist.&lt;ref name="ecology"&gt;{{cite book
 | author=Bateson, Gregory
 | title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology
 | publisher=University Of Chicago Press | year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 271-278.

A double bind generally includes different levels of abstraction in the order of messages and these messages can either be stated explicitly or implicitly within the context of the situation, or they can be conveyed by tone of voice or body language. Further complications arise when frequent double binds are part of an ongoing relationship to which the person or group is committed.&lt;ref name="schizophrenia"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ecology"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
The double bind is often misunderstood to be a simple contradictory situation, where the subject is trapped by two conflicting demands. While it's true that the core of the double bind is two conflicting demands, the difference lies in how they are imposed upon the subject, what the subject's understanding of the situation is, and who (or what) imposes these demands upon the subject. Unlike the usual [[no-win situation]], the subject has difficulty in defining the exact nature of the [[paradox]]ical situation in which he or she is caught. The [[contradiction]] may be unexpressed in its immediate context and therefore invisible to external observers, only becoming evident when a prior communication is considered. Typically, a demand is imposed upon the subject by someone whom he or she respects (such as a parent, teacher, or doctor) but the demand itself is inherently impossible to fulfill because some broader context forbids it. For example, this situation arises when a person in a position of [[authority]] imposes two contradictory conditions but there exists an unspoken rule that one must never question authority.

Gregory Bateson and his colleagues defined the double bind as follows&lt;ref name="schizophrenia"/&gt; (paraphrased):
{{ordered list|start=1
| The situation involves two or more people, one of whom (for the purpose of the definition), is designated as the "subject". The others are people who are considered the subject's superiors: figures of authority (such as parents), whom the subject respects.
| Repeated experience: the double bind is a recurrent theme in the experience of the subject, and as such, cannot be resolved as a single traumatic experience.
| A ‘primary [[injunction]]’ is imposed on the subject by the others generally in one of two forms:
*(a) “Do ''X'', or I will punish you”;
*(b) “Do not do ''X'', or I will punish you.”
The punishment may include the withdrawing of love, the expression of hate and anger, or abandonment resulting from the authority figure's expression of helplessness.
|4= A ‘secondary injunction’ is imposed on the subject, conflicting with the first at a higher and more abstract level. For example: “You must do ''X'', but only do it because you want to.” It is unnecessary for this injunction to be expressed verbally.
|5= If necessary, a ‘tertiary injunction’ is imposed on the subject to prevent them from escaping the dilemma. See phrase examples below for clarification.
|6= Finally, Bateson states that the complete list of the previous requirements may be unnecessary, in the event that the subject is already viewing their world in double bind patterns. Bateson goes on to give the general characteristics of such a relationship:
{{ordered list|type=lower-alpha
|1= ''When the subject is involved in an intense relationship; that is, a relationship in which he feels it is vitally important that he discriminate accurately what sort of message is being communicated so that he may respond appropriately;''
|2= ''And, the subject is caught in a situation in which the other person in the relationship is expressing two orders of message and one of these denies the other;''
|3= ''And, the subject is unable to comment on the messages being expressed to correct his discrimination of what order of message to respond to: i.e., he cannot make a [[Metacommunicative competence|metacommunicative]] statement.''
}}}}

Thus, the essence of a double bind is two conflicting demands, ''each on a different logical level'', neither of which can be ignored or escaped. This leaves the subject torn both ways, so that whichever demand they try to meet, the other demand cannot be met. "I must do it, but I can't do it" is a typical description of the double-bind experience.

For a double bind to be effective, the subject must be unable to confront or resolve the conflict between the demand placed by the primary injunction and that of the secondary injunction. In this sense, the double bind differentiates itself from a simple contradiction to a more inexpressible internal conflict, where the subject really ''wants'' to meet the demands of the primary injunction, but fails each time through an inability to address the situation's incompatibility with the demands of the secondary injunction. Thus, subjects may express feelings of extreme [[anxiety]] in such a situation, as they attempt to fulfil the demands of the primary injunction albeit with obvious contradictions in their actions.

This was a problem in United States legal circles prior to the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] being [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applied to state action]]. A person could be subpoenaed to testify in a federal case and given Fifth Amendment immunity for testimony in that case. However, since the immunity did not apply to a state prosecution, the person could refuse to testify at the Federal level despite being given immunity, thus subjecting the person to imprisonment for contempt of court, or the person could testify, and the information he or she was forced to give in the Federal proceeding could then be used to convict the person in a state proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/378/52/case.html Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n], 378 U.S. 52 (1964) ("One jurisdiction in our federal system may not, absent an immunity provision, compel a witness to give testimony which might incriminate him under the laws of another jurisdiction.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''double bind'' was first used by the [[anthropologist]] [[Gregory Bateson]] and his colleagues (including [[Donald deAvila Jackson|Don D. Jackson]], [[Jay Haley]] and [[John Weakland|John H. Weakland]]) in the mid-1950s in their discussions on complexity of communication in relation to [[schizophrenia]]. Bateson made clear that such complexities are common in normal circumstances, especially in "play, humour, poetry, ritual and fiction" (see [[#Theory of logical types|Logical Types]] below). Their findings indicated that the tangles in communication often diagnosed as schizophrenia are not necessarily the result of an organic brain dysfunction. Instead, they found that destructive double binds were a frequent pattern of communication among families of patients, and they proposed that growing up amidst perpetual double binds could lead to learned patterns of confusion in thinking and communication.

==Complexity in communication==
Human communication is complex, and context is an essential part of it. Communication consists of the words said, tone of voice, and body language. It also includes how these relate to what has been said in the past; what is not said, but is implied; how these are modified by other nonverbal cues, such as the environment in which it is said, and so forth. For example, if someone says "I love you", one takes into account who is saying it, their [[tone of voice]] and [[body language]], and the context in which it is said. It may be a declaration of passion or a serene reaffirmation, insincere and/or manipulative, an implied demand for a response, a joke, its public or private context may affect its [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], and so forth.

Conflicts in communication are common and often we ask "What do you mean?" or seek clarification in other ways. This is called ''[[meta-communication]]:'' communication about the communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psychcentral.com/lib/meta-communication-what-i-said-isnt-what-i-meant/|title=Meta-communication: What I Said Isn’t What I Meant {{!}} Psych Central|date=2016-05-17|newspaper=Psych Central|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, asking for clarification is impossible. Communication difficulties in ordinary life often occur when meta-communication and feedback systems are lacking or inadequate or there isn't enough time for clarification.
 
Double binds can be extremely stressful and become destructive when one is trapped in a dilemma and punished for finding a way out.  But making the effort to find the way out of the trap can lead to emotional growth.

==Examples==
The classic example given of a negative double bind is of a mother telling her child that she loves him or her, while at the same time turning away in disgust, or inflicting [[corporal punishment]] as discipline:&lt;ref&gt;Koopmans, Mathijs. [http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/1997/Koopmans.html] ''Schizophrenia and the Family: Double Bind Theory Revisited'' 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; the words are socially acceptable; the body language is in conflict with it. The child does not know how to respond to the conflict between the words and the body language and, because the child is dependent on the mother for basic needs, they are in a quandary. Small children have difficulty articulating contradictions verbally and can neither ignore them nor leave the relationship.

Another example is when one is commanded to "be spontaneous". The very command contradicts spontaneity, but it only becomes a double bind when one can neither ignore the command nor comment on the contradiction. 
Often, the contradiction in communication is not apparent to bystanders unfamiliar with previous communications.

===Phrase examples===
* Mother telling her child: "You must love me".
: The primary injunction here is the command itself: "you must"; the secondary injunction is the unspoken reality that love is spontaneous, that for the child to love the mother genuinely, it can only be of his or her own accord.
* Child-abuser to child: "You should have escaped from me earlier, now it's too late—because now, nobody will believe that you didn't want what I have done", while at the same time blocking all of the child's attempts to escape.

: Child-abusers often start the double-bind relationship by "[[Child grooming|grooming]]" the child, giving little concessions, or gifts or privileges to them, thus the primary injunction is: "You should like what you are getting from me!"

: When the child begins to go along (i.e. begins to like what she or he is receiving from the person), then the interaction goes to the next level and small [[victimization]] occurs, with the secondary injunction being: "I am punishing you! (for whatever reason the child-abuser is coming up with, e.g. "because you were bad/naughty/messy", or "because you deserve it", or "because you made me do it", etc.).

: If child shows any resistance (or tries to escape) from the abuser, then the words: "You should have escaped from me earlier (...)" serve as the third level or tertiary injunction.

: Then the loop starts to feed on itself, allowing for ever worse victimization to occur.

* Mother to son: "Leave your sister alone!", while the son knows his sister will approach and antagonize him to get him into trouble.

: The primary injunction is the command, which he will be punished for breaking. The secondary injunction is the knowledge that his sister will get into conflict with him, but his mother will not know the difference and will default to punishing him. He may be under the impression that if he argues with his mother, he may be punished. One possibility for the son to escape this double bind is to realize that his sister only antagonizes him to make him feel anxious (if indeed it is the reason behind his sister's behavior).

: If he were not bothered about punishment, his sister might not bother him. He could also leave the situation entirely, avoiding both the mother and the sister. The sister can't claim to be bothered by a non-present brother, and the mother can't punish (nor scapegoat) a non-present son. Other solutions exist too, which are based on the creative application of logic and reasoning.
: An apt reply would be: "Please tell sis the same". If mother wants to 'scapegoat' him, her response will be negative. The command has a negative undertone towards the son.

== Positive double binds ==

Bateson also described positive double binds, both in relation to [[Zen Buddhism]] with its path of spiritual growth, and the use of therapeutic double binds by psychiatrists to confront their patients with the contradictions in their life in such a way that would help them heal. One of Bateson's consultants, [[Milton H. Erickson]] (5 volumes, edited by Rossi) eloquently demonstrated the productive possibilities of double binds through his own life, showing the technique in a brighter light.

== Science ==

One of the causes of double binds is the loss of [[feedback]] systems.  Gregory Bateson and Lawrence S. Bale describe double binds that have arisen in science that have caused decades-long delays of progress in science because the scientific community had defined something as outside of its scope (or as "not science")—see Bateson in his ''Introduction'' to Steps to an Ecology of Mind (1972, 2000), pp. xv–xxvi; and Bale in his article, ''Gregory Bateson, Cybernetics and the Social/Behavioral Sciences'' (esp. pp.&amp;nbsp;1–8) on the paradigm of classical science vs. that of systems theory/cybernetics. (See also Bateson's description in his ''Forward'' of how the double bind hypothesis fell into place).

==  Work by Bateson  ==

=== Schizophrenia ===
The Double Bind Theory was first articulated in relationship to schizophrenia, but Bateson and his colleagues hypothesized that schizophrenic thinking was not necessarily an inborn mental disorder but a learned confusion in thinking.
It is helpful to remember the context in which these ideas were developed. Bateson and his colleagues were working in the Veteran's Administration Hospital (1949–1962) with World War II veterans. As soldiers they'd been able to function well in combat, but the effects of life-threatening stress had affected them.  At that time, 18 years before Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder was officially recognized, the veterans had been saddled with the catch-all diagnosis of schizophrenia.  Bateson didn't challenge the diagnosis but he did maintain that the seeming nonsense the patients said at times did make sense within context, and he gives numerous examples in section III of ''Steps to an Ecology of Mind'', "Pathology in Relationship". For example, a patient misses an appointment, and when Bateson finds him later the patient says 'the judge disapproves'; Bateson responds, "You need a defense lawyer" see following (pp.&amp;nbsp;195–6) Bateson also surmised that people habitually caught in double binds in childhood would have greater problems—that in the case of the schizophrenic, the double bind is presented continually and habitually within the family context from infancy on. By the time the child is old enough to have identified the double bind situation, it has already been internalized, and the child is unable to confront it. The solution then is to create an escape from the conflicting logical demands of the double bind, in the world of the [[delusion]]al system (see in ''Towards a Theory of Schizophrenia&amp;nbsp;– Illustrations from Clinical Data'').

One solution to a double bind is to place the problem in a larger context, a state Bateson identified as Learning III, a step up from Learning II (which requires only learned responses to reward/consequence situations). In Learning III, the double bind is contextualized and understood as an impossible no-win scenario so that ways around it can be found.

Bateson's double bind theory was never followed up by research into whether family systems imposing systematic double binds might be a cause of schizophrenia.  This complex theory has been only partly tested, and there are gaps in the current [[Psychology|psychological]] and experimental evidence required to establish [[wikt:causation|causation]] [citation?]. The current understanding of [[schizophrenia]] emphasizes the robust scientific evidence for a genetic predisposition to the disorder, with psychosocial stressors, including dysfunctional family interaction patterns, as secondary causative factors in some instances.

=== Evolution ===

After many years of research into schizophrenia, Bateson continued to explore problems of communication and learning, first with dolphins, and then with the more abstract processes of [[evolution]]. Bateson emphasised that any communicative system characterized by different logical levels might be subject to double bind problems. Especially including the communication of characteristics from one generation to another (genetics and evolution).

"...evolution always followed the pathways of viability. As Lewis Carroll has pointed out, the theory [of natural selection] explains quite satisfactorily why there are no bread-and-butter-flies today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bateson|first=Gregory|title=Cybernetic Explanation|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|date=April 1967|volume=10|issue=8|pages=29–32|doi=10.1177/0002764201000808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bateson used the fictional Bread and Butter Fly (from ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'') to illustrate the double bind in terms of natural selection. The gnat points out that the insect would be doomed if he found his food (which would dissolve his own head), and starve if he did not. Alice suggests that this must happen quite often, to which the gnat replies "it always happens".

The pressures that drive evolution therefore represent a genuine double bind. And there is truly no escape: "It always happens." No species can escape natural selection, including our own.

Bateson suggested that all evolution is driven by the double bind, whenever circumstances change: If any environment becomes toxic to any species, that species will die out unless it transforms into another species, in which case, the species becomes extinct anyway.

Most significant here is Bateson's exploration of what he later came to call 'the pattern that connects'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bateson|first=Gregory|title=Mind and Nature|year=1979|isbn=978-1-57273-434-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;that problems of communication which span more than one level (e.g., the relationship between the individual and the family) should also be expected to be found spanning other pairs of levels in the hierarchy (e.g. the relationship between the genotype and the phenotype):

"We are very far, then, from being able to pose specific questions for the geneticist; but I believe that the wider implications of what I have been saying modify somewhat the philosophy of genetics. Our approach to the problems of schizophrenia by way of a theory of levels or logical types has disclosed first that the problems of adaptation and learning and their pathologies must be considered in terms of a hierarchic system in which stochastic change occurs at the boundary points between the segments of the hierarchy. We have considered three such regions of stochastic change&amp;mdash;the level of genetic mutation, the level of learning, and the level of change in family organization. We have disclosed the possibility of a relationship of these levels which orthodox genetics would deny, and we have disclosed that at least in human societies the evolutionary system consists not merely in the selective survival of those persons who happen to select appropriate environments but also in the modification of family environment in a direction which might enhance the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the individual members."

{{quote|Far from being restricted to a limited number of pathological cases, as American theoreticians suggest, the double bind—a contradictory double imperative, or rather a whole network of contradictory imperatives—is an extremely common phenomenon. In fact, it is so common that it might be said to form the basis of all human relationships.

Bateson is undoubtedly correct in believing that the effects of the double bind on the child are particularly devastating. All the grown-up voices around him, beginning with those of the father and mother (voices which, in our society at least, speak for the culture with the force of established authority) exclaim in a variety of accents, "Imitate us!" "Imitate me!" "I bear the secret of life, of true being!" The more attentive the child is to these seductive words, and the more earnestly he responds to the suggestions emanating from all sides, the more devastating will be the eventual conflicts. The child possesses no perspective that will allow him to see things as they are. He has no basis for reasoned judgements, no means of foreseeing the metamorphosis of his model into a rival. This model's opposition reverberates in his mind like a terrible condemnation; he can only regard it as an act of excommunication. The future orientation of his desires—that is, the choice of his future models—will be significantly affected by the dichotomies of his childhood. In fact, these models will determine the shape of his personality.

If desire is allowed its own bent, its mimetic nature will almost always lead it into a double bind. The unchanneled mimetic impulse hurls itself blindly against the obstacle of a conflicting desire. It invites its own rebuffs and these rebuffs will in turn strengthen the mimetic inclination. We have, then, a self-perpetuating process, constantly increasing in simplicity and fervor. Whenever the disciple borrows from his model what he believes to be the "true" object, he tries to possess that truth by desiring precisely what this model desires. Whenever he sees himself closest to the supreme goal, he comes into violent conflict with a rival. By a mental shortcut that is both eminently logical and self-defeating, he convinces himself that the violence itself is the most distinctive attribute of this supreme goal! Ever afterward, violence will invariably awaken desire...|[[René Girard]]|''Violence and the Sacred'': "From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double", pp.156–157}}

==Neuro-linguistic programming==
The field of [[neuro-linguistic programming]] also makes use of the expression "double bind". [[John Grinder|Grinder]] and [[Richard Bandler|Bandler]] (both of whom had personal contact with Bateson and Erickson) asserted that a message could be constructed with multiple messages, whereby the recipient of the message is given the impression of choice—although both options have the same outcome at a higher level of intention. This is called a "double bind" in NLP terminology,&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1981"&gt;Bandler, R., Grinder, J. (1981) Reframing: Neuro-Linguistic Programming and the Transformation of Meaning Real People Press. {{ISBN|0-911226-25-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has applications in both sales and therapy. In therapy, the practitioner may seek to challenge destructive double binds that limit the client in some way and may also construct double binds in which both options have therapeutic consequences. In a sales context, the speaker may give the respondent the illusion of choice between two possibilities. For example, a salesperson might ask: "Would you like to pay cash or by credit card?", with both outcomes presupposing that the person will make the purchase; whereas the third option (that of not buying) is intentionally excluded from the spoken choices.

Note that in the NLP context, the use of the phrase "double bind" does not carry the primary definition of two conflicting messages; it is about creating a false sense of choice which ultimately binds to the intended outcome. In the "cash or credit card?" example, this is not a "Bateson double bind" since there is no contradiction, although it still is an "NLP double bind". Similarly if a salesman were selling a [[Steal This Book|book about the evils of commerce]], it could perhaps be a "Bateson double bind" if the buyer happened to believe that commerce was evil, yet felt compelled or obliged to buy the book.

The '''extrinsic incentives bias''' is an [[attributional bias]] according to which people attribute relatively more to "extrinsic incentives" (such as monetary reward) than to "intrinsic incentives" (such as learning a new skill) when weighing the motives of others rather than themselves.

It is a counter-example to the [[fundamental attribution error]] as according to the extrinsic bias others are presumed to have ''situational'' motivations while oneself is seen as having ''dispositional'' motivations. This is the opposite of what the fundamental attribution error would predict. The term was first proposed by [[Chip Heath]], citing earlier research by others in [[management science]].&lt;ref name="heath"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heath|first=Chip|title=On the Social Psychology of Agency Relationships: Lay Theories of Motivation Overemphasize Extrinsic Incentives|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|year=1999|volume=78|issue=1|pages=25–62|url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/heath/documents/social%20psych%20of%20agency.pdf|doi=10.1006/obhd.1999.2826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
In the simplest experiment Heath reported, [[MBA]] students were asked to rank the expected job motivations of [[Citibank]] [[customer service|customer service representatives]]. Their average ratings were as follows:

# Amount of pay
# Having job security
# Quality of fringe benefits
# Amount of praise from your supervisor
# Doing something that makes you feel good about yourself
# Developing skills and abilities
# Accomplishing something worthwhile
# Learning new things

Actual customer service representatives rank ordered their own motivations as follows:

# Developing skills and abilities
# Accomplishing something worthwhile
# Learning new things
# Quality of fringe benefits
# Having job security
# Doing something that makes you feel good about yourself
# Amount of pay
# Amount of praise from your supervisor

The order of the predicted and actual reported motivations was nearly reversed; in particular, pay was rated first by others but near last for respondents of themselves. Similar effects were observed when MBA students rated managers and their classmates.&lt;ref name="heath"/&gt;

==Debiasing==
Heath suggests trying to infer others' motivations as one would by inferring one's own motivations.&lt;ref name="heath" /&gt;

[[Image:Full depth recycling screenshot.jpg|thumb|Full Depth Reclamation]]

'''Full depth recycling''' or '''full depth reclamation''' ('''FDR'''), is a process that rebuilds worn out [[asphalt]] [[Pavement (material)|pavements]] by recycling the existing roadway.

Old asphalt and base materials are pulverized using a specialized machine called a [[reclaimer]]. On top of the pulverized material, water is added to reach the optimal moisture content for [[Soil compaction|compaction]] and then a variety of materials, such as dry [[cement]], [[Lime (mineral)|lime]], [[fly ash]], or asphalt [[emulsion]] are incorporated for [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilization]]. A reclaimer is used again to mix all the materials. After shaping and [[Grade (slope)|grading]], the new base is compacted to produce a strong, durable base for either an asphalt or [[concrete]] surface.

Since this method [[recycle]]s the materials ''[[in situ]]'', there is no need to haul in [[Aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] or haul out old material for [[waste management|disposal]]. The [[vehicle]] movements are reduced and there is no need for detours since it can be done under [[traffic]], making this process more convenient for local residents.

FDR with cement saves money while preserving [[natural resource]]s by using existing materials and conserving virgin [[construction aggregate|aggregates]]. The road performance is improved through better stabilization, building a stronger, low-maintenance road that will last for many years.

With proper engineering and testing protocols the FDR process provides a design life-cycle of 30-years.  FDR is a manufacturing process and not an installation.  Other pavement materials, such as concrete, asphalt, or aggregate base go through a rigorous quality control program that meets a qualified standard prior to site delivery and contractor installation.  The FDR process requires the same level of understanding and product controls during lab testing and field verification to meet long-term performance goals.

'''Gaussian units''' constitute a [[metric system]] of [[units of measurement|physical units]]. This system is the most common of the several electromagnetic unit systems based on [[Centimetre gram second system of units|cgs (centimetre–gram–second) units]]. It is also called the '''Gaussian unit system''', '''Gaussian-cgs units''', or often just '''cgs units'''.&lt;ref&gt;One of many examples of using the term "cgs units" to refer to Gaussian units is: [http://nlpc.stanford.edu/nleht/Science/reference/conversion.pdf Lecture notes from Stanford University]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "cgs units" is ambiguous and therefore to be avoided if possible: cgs contains within it several conflicting sets of electromagnetism units, not just Gaussian units, as described below.

The most common alternative to Gaussian units are [[International System of Units|SI units]]. SI units are predominant in most fields, and continue to increase in popularity at the expense of Gaussian units.&lt;ref name=Rowlett/&gt;&lt;ref name=JacksonEditions/&gt; (Other alternative unit systems also exist, as discussed below.) Conversions between Gaussian units and SI units are not as simple as normal unit conversions. For example, the ''formulas'' for physical laws of electromagnetism (such as [[Maxwell's equations]]) need to be adjusted depending on what system of units one uses. As another example, quantities that are [[dimensionless]] (loosely "unitless") in one system may have dimension in another.

==History==
Gaussian units existed before the CGS system.  The British Association report of 1873 that proposed the CGS contains gaussian units derived from the foot–grain–second and metre–gram–second as well.  There are also references to foot–pound–second gaussian units.

==Alternative unit systems==
{{main|Centimetre gram second system of units#Alternate derivations of CGS units in electromagnetism|l1=Alternative CGS units in electromagnetism}}
The main alternative to the Gaussian unit system is [[International System of Units|SI units]], historically also called the [[MKS system of units|MKSA system of units]] for metre–kilogram–second–ampere.&lt;ref name=Rowlett/&gt;

The Gaussian unit system is just one of several electromagnetic unit systems within CGS. Others include "[[Centimetre gram second system of units#Electrostatic units (ESU)|electrostatic units]]", "[[Centimetre gram second system of units#Electromagnetic units (EMU)|electromagnetic units]]", and [[Lorentz–Heaviside units]].

Some other unit systems are called "[[natural units]]", a category that includes [[atomic units]], [[Planck units]], and others.

SI units are by far the most common today. In [[engineering]] and practical areas, SI is nearly universal and has been for decades.&lt;ref name=Rowlett&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/cgsmks.html "CGS"], in ''How Many? A Dictionary of Units of Measurement'', by Russ Rowlett and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/ref&gt; In technical, scientific literature (such as [[theoretical physics]] and [[astronomy]]), Gaussian units were predominant until recent decades, but are now getting progressively less so.&lt;ref name=Rowlett/&gt;&lt;ref name=JacksonEditions&gt;For example, one widely used graduate electromagnetism textbook is ''Classical Electrodynamics'' by J.D. Jackson. The second edition, published in 1975, used Gaussian units exclusively, but the third edition, published in 1998, uses mostly SI units. Similarly, ''Electricity and Magnetism'' by Edward Purcell is a popular undergraduate textbook. The second edition, published in 1984, used Gaussian units, while the third edition, published in 2013, switched to SI units.&lt;/ref&gt; The CGS-Gaussian unit system is recognized as having advantages in [[classical electromagnetism|classical]] and [[relativistic electromagnetism|relativistic electrodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th}}, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural units are most common in more theoretical and abstract fields of physics, particularly [[particle physics]] and [[string theory]].

==Major differences between Gaussian and SI units==

==="Rationalized" unit systems===

One difference between Gaussian and SI units is in the factors of 4π in various formulas. SI electromagnetic units are called "rationalized",&lt;ref name=Littlejohn&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1112/notes/emunits.pdf | format=PDF | title=Gaussian, SI and Other Systems of Units in Electromagnetic Theory | work=Physics 221A, University of California, Berkeley lecture notes | author=Littlejohn, Robert | date=Fall 2017 | accessdate=2018-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kowalski&gt;Kowalski, Ludwik, 1986, "[http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML A Short History of the SI Units in Electricity,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429035624/http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML |date=2009-04-29 }}"  ''The Physics Teacher'' 24(2): 97–99. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.2341955 Alternate web link (subscription required)]&lt;/ref&gt; because [[Maxwell's equations]] have no explicit factors of 4''π'' in the formulae. On the other hand, the [[inverse-square law|inverse-square]] force laws &amp;ndash; [[Coulomb's law]] and the [[Biot–Savart law]] &amp;ndash; ''do'' have a factor of 4''π'' attached to the ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In ''unrationalized'' Gaussian units (not [[Lorentz–Heaviside units]]) the situation is reversed: Two of Maxwell's equations have factors of 4''π'' in the formulas, while both of the inverse-square force laws, Coulomb's law and the Biot–Savart law, have no factor of 4''π'' attached to ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the denominator.

(The quantity 4''π'' appears because 4''πr''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the surface area of the sphere of radius ''r''. For details, see the articles [[Gauss's law#Relation to Coulomb's law|Relation between Gauss's law and Coulomb's law]] and [[Inverse-square law]].)

===Unit of charge===

A major difference between Gaussian and SI units is in the definition of the unit of charge. In SI, a separate base unit (the [[ampere]]) is associated with electromagnetic phenomena, with the consequence that something like electrical charge (1 [[coulomb]] = 1 ampere × 1 second) is a unique dimension of physical quantity and is not expressed purely in terms of the mechanical units (kilogram, metre, second). On the other hand, in Gaussian units, the unit of electrical charge (the [[statcoulomb]], statC) ''can'' be written entirely as a dimensional combination of the mechanical units (gram, centimetre, second), as:
:1 statC = 1 g&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

For example, [[Coulomb's law]] in Gaussian units is simple:

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F'' is the repulsive force between two electrical charges, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the two charges in question, and ''r'' is the distance separating them. If ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are expressed in [[statC]] and ''r'' in [[centimetre|cm]], then ''F'' will come out expressed in [[dyne]].

By contrast, the same law in SI units is:

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2} = k_\text{e} \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]], a quantity with ''dimension'', namely ([[electric charge|charge]])&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[time]])&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[mass]])&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ([[length]])&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Coulomb's constant]]. Without ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the two sides could not have consistent dimensions in SI, and in fact the quantity ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; does not even exist in Gaussian units.  This is an example of how some dimensional [[physical constant]]s can be eliminated from the expressions of [[physical law]] simply by the judicious choice of units.  In SI, 1/''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, converts or scales [[Electric displacement field|flux density]], '''D''', to [[electric field]], '''E''' (the latter has dimension of [[force]] per [[electric charge|charge]]), while in ''rationalized'' Gaussian units, flux density ''is'' the very same as electric field in [[free space]], not just a scaled copy.

Since the unit of charge is built out of mechanical units (mass, length, time), the relation between mechanical units and  electromagnetic phenomena is clearer in Gaussian units than in SI. In particular, in Gaussian units, the [[speed of light]] ''c'' shows up directly in electromagnetic formulas like [[Maxwell's equations]] (see below), whereas in SI it only shows up implicitly via the relation &lt;math&gt;\mu_0 \varepsilon_0=1/c^2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Units for magnetism===

In Gaussian units, unlike SI units, the electric field '''E''' and the [[magnetic field|magnetic field '''B''']] have the same dimension. This amounts to a factor of ''[[speed of light|c]]'' difference between how '''B''' is defined in the two unit systems, on top of the other differences.&lt;ref name=Littlejohn/&gt; (The same factor applies to other magnetic quantities such as '''[[magnetic field|H]]''' and '''[[magnetization|M]]'''.) For example, in a [[Sinusoidal plane-wave solutions of the electromagnetic wave equation|planar light wave in vacuum]], {{nowrap|1={{abs|'''E'''('''r''', ''t'')}} = {{abs|'''B'''('''r''', ''t'')}}}} in Gaussian units, while {{nowrap|1={{abs|'''E'''('''r''', ''t'')}} = ''c''{{abs|'''B'''('''r''', ''t'')}}}} in SI units.

===Polarization, magnetization===

There are further differences between Gaussian and SI units in how quantities related to polarization and magnetization are defined. For one thing, in Gaussian units, ''all'' of the following quantities have the same dimension: '''[[electric field|E]]''', '''[[electric displacement field|D]]''', '''[[polarization density|P]]''', [[magnetic field|'''B''', '''H''']], and '''[[magnetization|M]]'''. Another important point is that the [[electric susceptibility|electric]] and [[magnetic susceptibility]] of a material is dimensionless in both Gaussian and SI units, but a given material will have a different numerical susceptibility in the two systems. (Equation is given below.)

==List of equations==

This section has a list of the basic formulae of electromagnetism, given in both Gaussian and SI units. Most symbol names are not given; for complete explanations and definitions, please click to the appropriate dedicated article for each equation. A simple conversion scheme for use when tables are not available may be found in

All formulas except otherwise noted are from Ref.&lt;ref name=Littlejohn/&gt;

===Maxwell's equations===
{{main|Maxwell's equations}}

Here are Maxwell's equations, both in macroscopic and microscopic forms. Only the "differential form" of the equations is given, not the "integral form"; to get the integral forms apply the [[divergence theorem]] or [[Stokes' theorem|Kelvin–Stokes theorem]].

===Dielectric and magnetic materials===

Below are the expressions for the various fields in a dielectric medium. It is assumed here for simplicity that the medium is homogeneous, linear, isotropic, and nondispersive, so that the [[permittivity]] is a simple constant.

| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \chi_\text{e}\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;

| &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = 1+4\pi\chi_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon/\varepsilon_0 = 1+\chi_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
where
*'''E''' and '''D''' are the [[electric field]] and [[Electric displacement field|displacement field]], respectively;
*'''P''' is the [[polarization density]];
*&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permittivity]];
*&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permittivity of vacuum]] (used in the SI system, but meaningless in Gaussian units);
*&lt;math&gt;\chi_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electric susceptibility]]

The quantities &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; in Gaussian units and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon/\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; in SI are both dimensionless, and they have the same numeric value. By contrast, the [[electric susceptibility]] &lt;math&gt;\chi_e&lt;/math&gt; is unitless in both systems, but has ''different numeric values'' in the two systems for the same material:
::&lt;math&gt;\chi_\text{e}^\text{SI} = 4\pi \chi_\text{e}^\text{G}&lt;/math&gt;

Next, here are the expressions for the various fields in a magnetic medium. Again, it is assumed that the medium is homogeneous, linear, isotropic, and nondispersive, so that the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] is a simple constant.

::Note: The SI quantities &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0^{\text{SI}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_0^{\text{SI}}&lt;/math&gt; satisfy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0^{\text{SI}}\mu_0^{\text{SI}} = 1/c^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The conversion factors are written both symbolically and numerically. The numerical conversion factors can be derived from the symbolic conversion factors by [[dimensional analysis]]. For example, the top row says &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi\epsilon_0^{\text{SI}}}} = \frac{2.998 \times 10^9 \, \text{Fr}}{1\, \text{C}}&lt;/math&gt;, a relation which can be verified with dimensional analysis, by expanding &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0^{\text{SI}}&lt;/math&gt; and C in [[SI base units]], and expanding Fr in Gaussian base units.

It is surprising to think of measuring capacitance in centimetres. One useful example is that a centimetre of capacitance is the capacitance between a sphere of radius 1&amp;nbsp;cm in vacuum and infinity.

Another surprising unit is measuring [[resistivity]] in units of seconds. A physical example is: Take a [[parallel-plate capacitor]], which has a "leaky" dielectric with permittivity 1 but a finite resistivity. After charging it up, the capacitor will discharge itself over time, due to current leaking through the dielectric. If the resistivity of the dielectric is "X" seconds, the half-life of the discharge is ~0.05X seconds.&lt;!-- 0.05 ~ ln(2)/(4pi) --&gt; This result is independent of the size, shape, and charge of the capacitor, and therefore this example illuminates the fundamental connection between resistivity and time units.

===Dimensionally equivalent units===
A number of the units defined by the table have different names but are in fact dimensionally equivalent—i.e., they have the same expression in terms of the base units cm, g, s. (This is analogous to the distinction in SI between [[becquerel]] and [[Hertz|Hz]], or between [[newton metre]] and [[joule]].) The different names help avoid ambiguities and misunderstandings as to what physical quantity is being measured. In particular, ''all'' of the following quantities are dimensionally equivalent in Gaussian units, but they are nevertheless given different unit names as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQMsK5xW1DcC&amp;pg=PA155 |title='&amp;#39;Demystifying Electromagnetic Equations'&amp;#39;|page=155|publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General rules to translate a formula==

Any formula can be converted between Gaussian and SI units by using the symbolic conversion factors from Table 1 above.

For example, the [[Coulomb's law|electric field of a stationary point charge]] has the SI formula
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_{\text{SI}} = \frac{q_{\text{SI}}}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is distance, and the "SI" subscripts indicate that the electric field and charge are defined using SI definitions. If we want the formula to instead use the Gaussian definitions of electric field and charge, we look up how these are related using Table 1, which says:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbf{E}_{\text{G}}}{\mathbf{E}_{\text{SI}}} = \sqrt{4\pi\epsilon_0^{\text{SI}}} \quad , \quad \frac{q_{\text{G}}}{q_\text{SI}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi\epsilon_0^{\text{SI}}}}&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, after substituting and simplifying, we get the Gaussian-units formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_{\text{G}} = \frac{q_{\text{G}}}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
which is the correct Gaussian-units formula, as mentioned in a previous section.

For convenience, the table below has a compilation of the symbolic conversion factors from Table 1. To convert any formula from Gaussian units to SI units using this table, replace each symbol in the Gaussian column by the corresponding expression in the SI column (vice versa to convert the other way). This will reproduce any of the specific formulas given in the list above, such as Maxwell's equations, as well as any other formula not listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Бредов М.М. |author2=Румянцев В.В. |author3=Топтыгин И.Н. | title=Классическая электродинамика| publisher=[[Nauka (publisher)|Nauka]] |year=1985  | chapter=Appendix 5: Units transform (p.385)}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some examples of how to use this table, see:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qsl.net/g4cnn/units/units.htm Units in Electricity and Magnetism].

'''GenoPro''' is a software application for drawing [[family tree]]s and [[genogram]]s.  GenoPro can store additional information such as pictures, contacts, places, sources, occupation and education history for each individual, as well as document the relationships among individuals.

== History ==

GenoPro was created in 1998 by Daniel Morin while studying computer engineering at the [[University of Waterloo]]. His original idea stemmed from his father's request to design a genogram during his training as a family counselor.

GenoPro has had many constant updates and improvements over the years.  The following is a list of major version number updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genopro.com/setup/history/|title=GenoPro Version History|work=GenoPro Help|publisher=GenoPro}}http://www.genopro.com/setup/history/&lt;/ref&gt;  
* December, 2006 - GenoPro 2007 also known as GenoPro 2.0
* August, 2009 -  GenoPro 2.5.0.0 
* December, 2010 - GenoPro 2011 
* October 2015 - GenoPro 2016 was released.

== Features ==
{{Advert|section|date=November 2011}}
GenoPro’s architecture revolves around the pedigree layout where the user can view the entire genealogy tree at once, including family branches in any direction to illustrate the complex scenarios based on today's reconstructed families.  With GenoPro, the user can manually customize the layout by positioning the individuals as well as using color to graphically emphasize what he/she feels is important in the family, such as ethnicity, culture, citizenship, education level, religion, political affiliations, and diseases in the case of medical pedigrees.

GenoPro can split a large family tree into many sub-trees and hyperlink them together.  With only two mouse clicks, the user can move an entire branch to another sheet.  GenoPro creates the necessary [[hyperlink]]s to connect the trees.  Supporting multiple sub trees is necessary for scaling large family trees containing tens of thousands of individuals.  

GenoPro can display data just like traditional genealogy software.  GenoPro's spreadsheet includes hyperlinks to navigate between any objects, from parents to children to siblings, or across pictures, places, sources and citations.  GenoPro's spreadsheet allows various functions, including in-place editing, bulk-editing, finding and replacing, data sorting, copying and pasting with other commercial spreadsheet applications, and of course, unlimited use of the [[Undo|undo/redo]] function for every operation.

GenoPro displays special symbols to distinguish different family relationships such as marriage, divorce, cohabitation and love affairs, as well as other symbols for [[Genogram#Emotional relationships|emotional relationships]] such as friendship, love, distrust, hostility and jealousy.

GenoPro supports the creation of same-sex relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genopro.com/faq/how-do-i-add-relationships-like-man-man-and-woman-woman.aspx|title=How do I add relationships like man-man and woman-woman?|work=GenoPro Help|publisher=GenoPro|accessdate=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike other programs such as [[Personal Ancestral File]], which do not.

GenoPro's [[report]] generator can create [[HTML]] pages linked to interactive [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)]] family trees.  Reports in GenoPro can be customized by modifying the full source code for each built-in report.  GenoPro's report generator uses [[Active Scripting|scripting languages]] such as [[VBScript]] and [[JavaScript]]. GenoPro sports built-in ASP objects and many additional objects making it easy to generate elaborate reports.  GenoPro can also load third-party COM modules made in other programming languages such C++, C#, VB.NET or Java and/or connect to external databases such as [[Microsoft SQL Server|Microsoft SQL]], [[MySQL]], or [[Oracle Database|Oracle]] to fetch additional data for generating a report.  The current version of GenoPro includes a new type of report to generate [[Office Open XML|Microsoft Word]] and [[OpenDocument|OpenOffice]] documents.

GenoPro has its own [[Object database|object-oriented database]] engine designed to foster hierarchical data and circular references.  Hierarchical data is the key for avoiding redundant data, which in turn eliminates inconsistencies, and reduces typing and memory storage.  The greatest benefit of hierarchical data is providing a hierarchy for classifying data, such as grouping places by country, state, city and buildings.  A building, such as a hospital or cemetery may further be divided into rooms and lots for finer data granularity.  Since places are objects, the user can enter minute details, from street addresses and pictures, to latitude and longitude for [[Global Positioning System|GPS positioning]]. Any place deriving from a parent place will inherit its parent's values, unless overwritten.

GenoPro's report generator understands hierarchical data and its generated reports give the user the option to expand each node to view details.  Also, the report generator displays Geo Mapping in the Google Map for every place defined by a city name or a GPS position.  [[Circular reference|Circular referencing]] is very common in genealogy, such as displaying a picture for a place, and linking this place to its original picture.  Relational databases do not handle circular referencing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Microsoft TechNet - SQL Server CREATE TABLE|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173393.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Microsoft Developer Network - SQL Syntax|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa372021(VS.85).aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Oracle Documentation - SQL Error Messages|url=http://download.oracle.com/docs/html/A86730_01/error_me.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if such a catastrophic scenario happens, the data is in a [[deadlock]] and cannot be deleted.  Hierarchical data is nearly impossible to achieve for standard databases without writing massive bug-prone code requiring excessive processing, thus rendering the entire application extremely slow and unusable for large amounts of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Amazon.com Book - Joe Celko's Trees and Hierarchies in SQL for Smarties|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1558609202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Optimizing Hierarchical data for Tree Controls |url=http://codebetter.com/blogs/steve.hebert/archive/2007/09/27/optimizing-hierarchical-data-for-tree-controls.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Storing Hierarchical Data in a Database|url=http://www.sitepoint.com/print/hierarchical-data-database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Languages Available ==
GenoPro is available in 56 languages, including [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Scottish Gaelic|Scots Gaelic]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].  GenoPro features an online [[collaboration]] system where users can translate the menus, dialogs and error messages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5499">[[File:HumanRightsLogo.svg|thumb|right|250px|The Human Rights Logo]]
'''The Human Rights Logo''' has its origin in the international "Logo for Human Rights" initiative, which was started in 2010. Its goal was to create an internationally recognized [[logo]] to support the [[Human rights|global human rights movement]]. The winning logo was created by Predrag Stakić from [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15412732,00.html | title=Serbian designer wins competition for a global human rights logo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The winning logo==
The Human Rights Logo combines the silhouette of a hand with that of a bird, and a white thumb grabbing the bird. It is intended as a peaceful contribution towards strengthening human rights and as such is meant to be used across cultural and language borders. The logo is now available to everyone at no cost as an open source product. It is free from rights and can be used worldwide by everyone without paying fees or obtaining licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jana |first=Reena |url=http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/design-architecture/a-logo-for-human-rights/497 |title=A logo for human rights |publisher=SmartPlanet |date=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The competition==
The goal of the Logo for Human Rights initiative was to create an internationally recognized symbol for human rights. To this end, an international online design competition starting on 3 May 2011 ([[World Press Freedom Day]]) launched a global appeal for submissions of logo designs and put them to a vote. The competition until today is known as one of the largest, most complex creative [[crowdsourcing]] projects ever conducted.

From the more than 15,300 suggestions from over 190 countries a collective decision by all participants selected the top ten logos. After which an international jury decided on the top ten logos.&lt;ref name="diplo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kampala.diplo.de/Vertretung/kampala/en/Seite__Human_20Rights_20Logo.html |title=German Embassy Kampala - A Logo for Human Rights |publisher=Kampala.diplo.de |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these 10 logos, the internet community selected a winner within a three-week voting period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ishr.ch/a-logo-for-human-rights |title=A Logo for Human Rights |publisher=Ishr.ch |date=November 10, 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502105931/http://www.ishr.ch/a-logo-for-human-rights |archivedate=May 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The competition officially ended on 23 September with the presentation of the universal logo for human rights during [[UN General Assembly]] week in [[New York City]].

==Presentation of the winning logo==
The presentation of the winning logo took place on 23 September 2011 in New York, with former editor-in-chief of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' [[Michael Elliott (editor)|Michael Elliott]] hosting the event.
In speeches, television journalist [[Ann Curry]] and German Federal Foreign Minister [[Guido Westerwelle]], as well as human rights activists [[Carolyn Gomes]] from [[Jamaica]] and Angelina Atyam from [[Uganda]], emphasized the importance of a universal symbol in the worldwide struggle for human rights. The musical highlight of the evening was a performance by soprano [[Jessye Norman]].

==The jury==
The initiative is supported by a jury of renowned and high-ranking personalities, who have worked to further the cause of human rights. These include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://humanrightslogo.net | title=Human Rights Logo.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of its high level of immigration and emigration and its status as common source and destination for a large amount of international travel the United States has more incoming and outgoing [[international child abduction]]s per year than any other country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  To address this issue the United States played an active role in the drafting of the 1980 [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]] (commonly referred to as the ''Hague Abduction Convention'' or simply the ''Abduction Convention''.)  Although the United States was one of the first nations to sign the Convention in 1981 the Convention did not enter into force for the US until 1988 with the enactment by Congress of the [[International Child Abduction Remedies Act]] which translated the Convention into US law.&lt;ref name="Hcch.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&amp;cid=24 |title=Status Table of the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference |publisher=Hcch.net |date=1980-10-25 |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] the United States is required to fulfill many requirements designed to protect children from the harmful effects of international child abduction.  Domestic and foreign parents and attorneys have criticized the United States for its alleged failures to adequately fulfill these obligations on behalf of foreign and domestic families and children and in violation of international law.

==United States Legal System and International Abduction==
{{further|Law of the United States}}
[[File:Constitution of the United States, page 1.jpg|thumb|The [[United States Constitution]], the supreme law of the United States]]

The '''law of the United States''' consists of many levels&lt;ref&gt;See Stephen Elias and Susan Levinkind, ''Legal Research: How to Find &amp; Understand The Law'', 14th ed. (Berkeley: Nolo, 2005), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; of codified and uncodified forms of [[law]], of which the most important is the [[United States Constitution]], the foundation of the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] of the [[United States]].  The Constitution sets out the boundaries of [[federal law]], which consists of constitutional [[acts of Congress]], constitutional [[treaty|treaties]] ratified by [[United States Congress|Congress]], constitutional regulations promulgated by the [[executive branch]], and [[case law]] originating from the [[United States federal courts|federal judiciary]].

The Constitution and federal law are the [[Supremacy Clause|supreme law of the land]], thus preempting conflicting state and territorial laws in the fifty [[U.S. state]]s and in the territories.&lt;ref&gt;William Burnham, ''Introduction to the Law and Legal System of the United States'', 4th ed. (St. Paul, MN: Thomson West, 2006), 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the scope of federal preemption is limited, because the scope of federal power is itself rather limited.  In the unique dual-sovereign system of [[Federalism in the United States|American federalism]]. Most U.S. law (especially the actual "living law" of [[contract]], [[tort]], [[criminal law|criminal]], and [[family law]] experienced by the majority of citizens on a day-to-day basis) consists primarily of state law, which can and does vary greatly from one state to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence M. Friedman, ''A History of American Law'', 3rd ed. (New York: Touchstone, 2005), 307 and 504-505.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Hughes, "Common Law Systems," in ''Fundamentals of American Law'', ed. Alan B. Morisson, 9-26 (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 1996), 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

At both the federal and state levels, the law of the United States was originally derived largely from the [[common law]] system of [[English law]], which was in force at the time of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, U.S. law has since diverged greatly from its English ancestor both in terms of substance and procedure, and has incorporated a number of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] innovations.

States are separate [[sovereignty|sovereigns]] with their own [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]], [[state government]]s, and [[State court (United States)|state courts]] (including [[state supreme court]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|U.S. Const., Amend. X]].&lt;/ref&gt; They retain [[plenary power]] to make laws covering anything not preempted by the federal Constitution, federal statutes, or international treaties ratified by the federal Senate.  Normally, state supreme courts are the final interpreters of state constitutions and state law, unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue, in which case a decision may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court by way of a petition for writ of [[certiorari]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1257}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the Court applied the [[Supremacy Clause]] to international treaties, holding in the case of ''[[Missouri v. Holland]]'', [[Case citation|252 U.S. 416]] (1920), that the Federal government's ability to make [[treaty|treaties]] is supreme over any State concerns that such treaties might abrogate [[states' rights]] arising under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]].

==Hague Abduction Convention==
{{Main article|Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction}}
{{further|International Child Abduction Remedies Act}}
[[File:Members and Non Members of the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction Hague Convention.svg|thumb|alt=Hague Abduction Signatories|Hague Abduction Signatories {{legend|#4973C5|State parties to the convention (members of the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law|HCCH]])}}
                       {{legend|#14D9E1|State parties to the convention (non-members of the HCCH)}}|350px]]

The [[Hague Abduction Convention]] is a [[multilateralism|multilateral]] [[treaty]] (in force since 1 December 1983) aimed at providing an expeditious method to return children who are victim of international child abduction. The Convention was drafted to “to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting State" diverse from their country of [[habitual residence]], and "ensure that rights of [[child custody|custody]] and of access under the law of one Contracting State are effectively respected in the other Contracting States.”

Although the United States was one of the first nations to sign the Convention in 1981 the Convention did not enter into force for the United States until 1988 with the ratification of the treaty and enactment by Congress of the [[International Child Abduction Remedies Act]] which translated the Convention into US law.&lt;ref name="Hcch.net"/&gt; This was 5 years after the entry into force of the treaty.

===Courts empowered to hear Hague Abduction Convention cases===
The United States has two separate court systems, a Federal court system and a State court system. Both types of courts have authority to hear a Hague Abduction Convention case, as established by the International Child Abduction Remedies Act. It is up to the parents of abducted children and their attorneys to decide whether to file a petition for return in State or Federal court.

Although the exact implementation varies by state (also because states are free to adopt their own organizational scheme for judicial matters), trial courts are the general [[court of first instance]] to hear a Convention case within the State court system.

===United States legal precedents in Hague Convention cases===

Since the enactment of the [[International Child Abduction Remedies Act|ICARA]] and simultaneous ratification of the treaty by the [[United States Congress]] allowed it to enter into force in 1988, a number of important, and precedent setting decisions have been made on the Hague Convention's interpretation within the United States by federal courts.

====Abbott v. Abbott====
{{Main article|Abbott v. Abbott}}
The first [[Hague Abduction Convention]] case to be considered by the [[United States Supreme Court]] revolved around a whether or not a child from [[Chile]] was "wrongfully removed," as understood by the Convention, when a ''ne exeat'' order existing forbidding the custodial parent from removing the child from the country.  The Court found broad acceptance for the view that a ''ne exeat'' right, or a right to prevent a child's removal from his country of residence, is roughly equal to "[[joint custody]]" and is, thus, a "right of custody."   Accordingly, when the child was removed from Chile in violation of Mr. Abbott's ''ne exeat'' right, the child was "wrongfully removed" within the meaning of the Hague Convention.&lt;ref name="Abbott"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Abbott v. Abbott|docket=08-645|date=2010|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.plnavby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;page=08-64508-645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States Abduction Statistics==
{{Main article|Hague Abduction Convention Compliance Reports}}
[[File:Report on the Compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (2010 edition - front cover).jpg|thumb|150px|alt=2010 Report Covert|2010 Report Cover]]

The US State department publishes yearly reports are known as the [[Hague Abduction Convention Compliance Reports]] (or: Compliance Reports) in which statistics are presented on child abduction. The publication is a requirement by the US Congress and treats both compliance with the convention by member states and information on child abduction cases in non-member states. The reports highlight countries that they are non-compliant with the convention or exhibit a "pattern of noncompliance."  Since 1999, Mexico has been cited every year as being non-compliant or exhibiting "patterns of noncompliance". The reports form the basis for statistics on the United States and international child abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/pdf/2010ComplianceReport.pdf |title=2010 Compliance Report |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528014323/http://travel.state.gov/pdf/2010ComplianceReport.pdf# |archive-date=2010-05-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
Only Hong Kong, Macau, Israel, Thailand and Sri Lanka, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are contracting states to the Child Abduction Convention. Of these, Israel has been named several years as having "enforcement problems" in the complicance reports.

====Japan====
{{Main article|International child abduction in Japan}}

[[Japan]] is -with India- one of only two non-contracting states to the convention to rank as one of the top ten destination countries for the abduction of American children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/pdf/2009HagueAbductionConventionComplianceReport.pdf |title=Report on Compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction |author=Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs |date=April 2009 |work= |publisher=United States Department of State |accessdate=25 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018220035/http://travel.state.gov/pdf/2009HagueAbductionConventionComplianceReport.pdf# |archive-date=2009-10-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there is a  year by year increase in abduction cases. In 2009, 73 outstanding cases involving 104 children who have been abducted to or retained in Japan by parents were reported.&lt;ref name="dad released"/&gt;  An additional 29 cases involve American parties in Japan with one parent denied access to their child.&lt;ref name="dad released"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Dad Released From Japanese Jail in Custody Fight |author= |newspaper=ABC |date= |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/father-released-japanese-jail/Story?id=8833610&amp;page=2 |accessdate=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010 report 79 child abduction cases were mentioned involving 100 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Child custody division set up |author=MINORU MATSUTANI |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=3 December 2009 |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20091203a2.html |accessdate=3 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A State Department official stated in 2008 that no child has ever been returned to the United States from Japan as a result of diplomatic or legal means&lt;ref name="ABC1"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Spirited Away: Japan Won't Let Abducted Kids Go|newspaper=ABC News|url=http://i.abcnews.com/TheLaw/Story?id=4342760&amp;page=2}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official stated he knew of only three cases where children have returned to America, two involving reconciliation of parents, and one in which a 15-year-old child escaped to the American embassy.&lt;ref name="ABC1"/&gt;

====India====
&lt;!--the US-specifics of this section is unclear. Should it be here at all?--&gt;
[[India]] is not a signatory of the Hague Abduction Convention and India does not consider international child abduction a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/12/06/japan-india-pressed-curb-child-abductions/|title=Japan, India pressed to curb child abductions|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian courts rarely recognize U.S. custody orders, preferring to exert their own jurisdiction in rulings that tend to favor the parent who wants to keep the child in India. In the rare scenario that a case is resolved, it is usually due to an agreement between the parents, rather than the result of court orders or arrest warrants.

Cultural factors often impact child custody decisions in India. For example, Indian courts rarely grant custody to a parent residing outside of India, even if both the child and abducting parent are American citizens. Additionally, the courts tend to favor mothers when determining custody.

India does require the signature of both parents for an Indian passport to be issued to children younger than 18 years. India also requires exit permits for children.&lt;ref&gt;https://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_4441.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saudi Arabia====
[[Saudi Arabia]] is not a signatory of the Hague Abduction Convention nor are there any international or bilateral treaties in force between Saudi Arabia and the United States dealing with international parental child abduction.

In Saudi Arabia, child custody is based on [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. The primary concern of Saudi courts in deciding child custody cases is that the child be raised in accordance with the [[Islam|Islamic faith]]. Most custody disputes in Saudi Arabia are handled by the Islamic [[Sharia]] courts. In rare cases, the Board of Grievances, the most senior non-Sharia court, has ruled on custody disputes.

Saudi courts generally do not award custody of children to non-Saudi women. If the mother is an Arab Muslim, judges will usually not grant her custody of children unless she is residing in Saudi Arabia, or the father is not a Muslim. All Saudi citizens are considered to be Muslim.

Since Saudi women are prohibited from marrying non-Muslims, custody disputes between a Saudi mother and American father would be heard by the Sharia court, which would usually apply Islamic rules of custody. If the mother wins custody, the father is usually granted visitation rights. According to Saudi law, a child whose mother is Saudi and father is non-Saudi is not granted Saudi citizenship. However, even if an American father wins custody of his children, he may still need permission from the Saudi mother to remove the children from Saudi Arabia.

Normally, under Sharia law, a mother can maintain custody of her male children until the age of nine, and female children until age seven. In practice the courts favor keeping children within a strict Islamic environment. Sharia court judges have broad discretion in custody cases and often make exceptions to these general guidelines.

Even when a mother who is residing in Saudi Arabia is granted physical custody of children, the father maintains legal custody and has the right to determine where the children live and travel. In many cases, the father has been able to assume legal custody of children against the wishes of the mother when she is unable or unwilling to meet certain conditions set by law for her to maintain her custodial rights. For example, if the mother moves to another country, the father is entitled to have custody. A court can sever a mother's custody if it determines that the mother is incapable of safeguarding the child or of bringing the child up in accordance with the appropriate religious standards. The mother can lose custody by remarrying a non-Muslim, or by residing in a home with non-relatives. Sharia law allows custody of children to be awarded to the closest male relative of a Saudi father in the case of death or imprisonment of the father, even if the Saudi father has made clear his wish that the children's mother have full custody.

Custody orders and judgments of foreign courts are generally not enforceable in Saudi Arabia.  Courts in Saudi Arabia will not enforce U.S. court decrees ordering a parent in Saudi Arabia to pay [[child support]].

Women entering Saudi Arabia with the intent of visiting their children may do so only with the written permission of the father of the children. The father must file a "statement of no objection" with the Saudi Ministry of Interior before the mother will be granted a [[visa (document)|visa]] to enter the Kingdom. This includes Muslim fathers who are non-Saudi nationals. If the father refuses to sponsor the mother, or to authorize a child’s travel to another country, there is little that can be done to effect a visit. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General are not able to help American parents to obtain visas to Saudi Arabia without a no-objection letter. Neither the U.S. State Department nor the U.S. Mission in Saudi Arabia may serve as a woman's sponsor. Women visitors are required to be met by their sponsor upon arrival in Saudi Arabia.

If a non-Saudi father wants to enter the Kingdom to visit his children, he can do so by applying for a Saudi visa with proof that his children are living in Saudi Arabia. Saudi authorities may consult with the mother if she is Saudi, who may be able to prevent issuance of the visa.

Some American Muslim parents have considered traveling to Saudi Arabia on [[Umrah]] (religious pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]) as a means to visit their children. However, issuance of an Umrah visa does not guarantee that a parent will be permitted to see his or her children once in the Kingdom. If a woman is not divorced, the Saudi Embassy has the right to ask for her husband's permission for another family member (e.g. son) to act as the mother's Mahram. If the mother is divorced, the Saudi Embassy will ask to see the divorce certificate before granting the Umrah visa. Women married to Saudis should keep in mind that even when they enter the Kingdom on an Umrah visa, they would need their Saudi husband's permission to depart the country.

Persons who obtain a visa for business or religious visits (Hajj and Umrah) with the intention of visiting their children may face legal penalties including detention and/or deportation. While visitor visas are issued for approved tour groups following organized itineraries, these visitors are not permitted to travel outside the set itinerary.

Before traveling to Saudi Arabia to visit their children, women should consider whether they obtained a complete Islamic declaration of divorce from the Sharia court in Saudi Arabia. Secular, American divorce orders are not recognized by the Sharia courts. Although an Islamic divorce can be obtained from several mosques within the U.S., it has been the experience of several divorced spouses in the U.S. that the Sharia courts in Saudi Arabia will not recognize orders originating from an American mosque. The purpose of obtaining a Sharia declaration is to establish the legal personal status of the mother prior to traveling to the Kingdom. If an American woman is considered to still be married, the "husband" can prohibit the woman from departing Saudi Arabia.

Exit visas are required to leave Saudi Arabia. The U.S. Embassy or Consulates General cannot obtain exit visas for American citizens. Women must have permission from their husband or father to exit Saudi Arabia. The government of Saudi Arabia has been known to issue international arrest warrants against women who have taken their children from Saudi Arabia without the father's permission.&lt;ref name="SaudiArabiaFlyer"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_517.html |title=International Parental Child Abduction Saudi Arabia |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Most countries in Europe have are contracting parties to the Hague Abduction Convention, including all countries of the [[European Union]]. Most of these countries have never been mentioned in the compliance reports. Germany, Greece, Poland and Switzerland are notable exceptions.

====Germany====
The Hague Abduction Convention entered into force between Germany and the United States on December 1, 1990. According to the [compliance reports, 71 children abducted from the United States to Germany in 2009 and 20 children abducted from Germany to the United States during the same period.  Between 1999 and 2010 the reports have cited Germany as a "country of concern," having "enforcement problems," being "not fully compliant" or "demonstrated patterns of noncompliance" almost every year.

The Hague Convention came into force between the United States and Greece on June 1, 1993. Greece has been cited in the compliance Reports almost every year as either a "Country of Concern," having "Enforcement Problems," or "Demonstrating Patterns of Noncompliance."

Institutionally, the legal framework in Greece seems to support the necessary mechanisms for the Convention to function effectively. The Convention has force of law and has primacy over domestic law; first instance courts can hear Convention cases under expedited procedures (provisional or “emergency” measures), enforcement mechanisms exist and the Greek Central Authority will provide pro-bono legal assistance to victimized parents during Hague proceedings before the appropriate court in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_492.html |title=International Parental Child Abduction Greece |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hague Abduction Convention came into force between the United States and [[Poland]] on November 11, 1992. Poland has been cited in the compliance Reports for every year from 2000 to 2008 as either a "country of concern," having "enforcement problems" or "demonstrating patterns of noncompliance" with the Hague Abduction Convention resulting in an ongoing dialogue between the Polish Consul General and the [[Office of Children's Issues]] Director in Washington, D.C. and U.S. Embassy officials and Ministry of Justice officials in Warsaw.  Several high-level meetings between U.S. Embassy Warsaw and the Polish Ministry of Justice have been held where Ministry representatives indicated an intent to address many of these compliance issues and improve Poland’s Convention performance.  Officials from the [[U.S. Department of State]] and the U.S. Embassy in Poland have raised compliance issues and individual abduction cases with high-ranking officials from the Polish Government through diplomatic notes, formal demarches, and communications with the Polish Central Authority with former assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs [[Maura Harty]] raising the issue during bilateral meetings with her Polish counterpart.

Among the issues cited in the Compliance Reports, there is no specific legislation that implements the Convention in Poland. Unless there is a voluntary return, children normally remain in Poland during the entire Hague process, which often takes years. There is a perception that there is a gender bias in favor of mothers when they are abducting parents. Even though enforcement legislation has been passed, there appears to be reluctance on the part of officials to follow through with enforcement.  A faulty translation into Polish of Article 13 of the Convention which radically lowers the standard for refusing returns by saying that return can be denied if it would put the child in an "unfavorable" rather than an "intolerable" situation that some courts still use four years after the Ministry of Justice agreed in 1999 to distribute an accurate translation. Furthermore, Polish law does not permit courts to consider resources for child welfare and protection in the country of habitual residence when asked to consider the grave risk defense.

Polish authorities are often unable to locate the children and their abductors after courts ordered the return of a child. Law enforcement in Poland is limited by the fact that neither parental abduction nor the failure to comply with a Convention return order is a criminal offense in Poland. Consequently, Polish authorities have fewer investigative resources available to locate children and their abducting parents.  The lack of an adequate domestic statutory framework with enforcement mechanisms (e.g., a parent who becomes a fugitive to avoid complying with a final return judgment does not commit a "crime"—and therefore cannot be the subject of a fugitive warrant—unless the parent has been stripped of parental rights.)

Refusing to obey an order seems to carry few negative consequences for the taking parent. In some instances, the court rewarded the taking parent who refused to comply with a court order by ultimately ruling that, because so much time had elapsed, it was not in the child's best interests to be returned after all.

Even in cases where the left-behind parent has provided specific information about where the child is located, the ability of the Polish authorities to verify it is ineffective.  Further, once a child is located, there does not appear to be any mechanism to ensure that abducting parents cannot further abscond or conceal the child's whereabouts.  This is largely due to the fact that international parental child abduction is merely a civil offense in Poland.

Courts routinely order psychological evaluations and home studies. In one U.S. case an abducting parent in hiding was able to protest a return order in court while also collecting child support payments from the government.  This situation indicates that institutionally there is a disturbing lack of coordination among local law enforcement, the Polish Central Authority, and social welfare agencies.

The Polish procedure does limit the number of courts that can hear Hague cases in an attempt to allow judges to develop Hague expertise and the Polish Central Authority will provide pro bono legal assistance for victim parents during Hague proceedings before the appropriate court in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_515.html |title=International Parental Child Abduction Poland |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switzerland====
[[Switzerland]] has been frequently cited in the compliance reports as either a "Country of Concern," having "Enforcement Problems," or "Demonstrating Patterns of Noncompliance." In the 2010 report it was noted that: "delays in processing and enforcement often go on for weeks or months years{{clarify|date=January 2011}}, Swiss courts often treat Convention cases as custody decisions, invoking the child's “best interests” as a reason for denying return, and performing merits-based custody assessments, Swiss courts - up to and including Switzerland's highest court, often show bias toward the abducting parent, especially when the taking parent is the mother". High-level Swiss officials have defended this practice citing the “special relationship” between mothers and young children as influencing its decision to uphold the lower court's denial of the left-behind parent's application for return of an abducted child to the United States.  The report also observed that Swiss authorities are reluctant to actively enforce orders granting return to the United States or access to the child by the left-behind parent. Law enforcement has made only cursory efforts to locate taking parent and abducted children.{{clarify|is this according to the report?|date=January 2011}}

===Latin America===
[[File:Latin America (orthographic projection).svg|125px|left]]

According to the statistics in the [[US Department of State]]'s [[Hague Abduction Convention Compliance Reports|Compliance Reports]], as of 2010, 721 out of 1194, or 60%, of the children abducted from the United States to a Hague Convention partner were taken to [[Latin America]] with [[Mexico]] alone accounting for 474 or 40%.

The Child Abduction Convention entered into force between [[Brazil]] with the United States in 2003.  The US Department of State denoted Brazil as a country demonstrating "patterns of noncompliance" with the Hague Abduction Convention in 2008 and 2009.  In 2010 the status of Brazil's compliance was downgraded to that of "non-compliant." According to a 2009 [[New York Times]] report, there were at the time around fifty unsolved Convention cases for children abducted from the United States to Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, K (2009), ''Court Battle Over a Child Strains Ties in 2 Nations'', New York Times, 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The report states that Brazil has a history of non-compliance, and the Brazilian judiciary has a general inability to adjudicate a final and unappealable decision in Convention cases.

The subject of child abduction between the United States and Brazil received sustained media attention during 2009 and early 2010 as a result of the [[Goldman child abduction case]].  US Congress introduced H.R. 2702{{clarify|date=January 2011}}, legislation to suspend Brazil's [[Generalized System of Preferences]] trading benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-2702&amp;tab=summary|title=Suspend Brazil GSP Act (2009; 111th Congress H.R. 2702) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was also discussed on the US House of Representatives floor with a statement from Congressman [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] (Republican, New Jersey), a staunch supporter of David Goldman, a New Jersey resident;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/record.xpd?id=111-h20090603-55 Rep Chrsi Smith: On Sean Goldman - Justice Delayed Again]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] treated the case as a diplomatic issue of Brazil's obligations under the Hague Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/12/134047.htm ''Return of Sean Goldman''] (Statement of Secretary of State Clinton, 2009-12-24)&lt;/ref&gt;  After nearly six years of litigation in Brazil, U.S. Senator [[Frank Lautenberg]] of [[New Jersey]] placed a hold on a trade bill which allows certain countries, including Brazil, to export certain products to the United States duty-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-5995670-503544.html | work=CBS News | first=Brian | last=Montopoli | title=David Goldman Custody Battle Leads to Block of Trade Bill | date=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Days later, by a decision of [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Brazil's Supreme Court]], Sean was handed over to his father on December 24, 2009.

====Chile====
[[File:Coat of arms of Chile.svg|right|100px]]
[[Chile]] signed the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] in 1994 and it entered into force with the United States in the same year.  The [[US Department of State]] has denoted Chile as a country demonstrating "patterns of noncompliance" or a "not fully compliant" with the Hague Abduction Convention every year during the five period between 2005 and 2009 for its judicial Performance.  
Chilean courts delay Convention cases and often improperly treat them as [[child custody]] decisions, citing the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. U.S. parents often experience bias by the courts in favor of Chilean parents, especially Chilean mothers. In addition, it is customary in Chilean courts to order psychological or social evaluations in all cases involving minor children, regardless of whether there is evidence of possible risk to the child in being returned to his or her country of habitual residence. Because the Hague Convention focuses on returning a child to his or her country of habitual residence, the United States [[Central Authority]] takes the view that psychological evaluations are unnecessary, and cause inappropriate delays in processing cases, if there is no evidence of risk to the child should the court order the child’s return.

Another trend is for Chilean courts to deny Convention applications upon finding that the child is well settled in the new environment. This result, which could be avoided if Chilean courts handled Convention cases more expeditiously, leaves the victim parent with the much less desirable option of filing an application under the Convention for mere access to the child, or for visitation, and even these applications in some cases have not resulted in contact between the left behind family and the child. In 2008, a Chilean court ordered a scheduled access visit by the LBP, and the left behind parent purchased and confirmed his plane ticket and accommodations for the trip. Hours before the parent was scheduled to board the plane for Chile, the Chilean Central Authority notified him that the Chilean judge had suspended the scheduled visitation.  In April 2008, the Chilean Central Authority sponsored a seminar on the Convention and its application in Chile, including topics such as the emotional impact of international child abduction on children and parents, and the role of “network judges” in promoting the correct application of the Convention in Chile.  Several months after the seminar, the Chilean Supreme Court designated a family court judge to serve as Chile’s network judge for Convention cases.

====Colombia====
[[File:Coat of arms of Colombia.svg|right|100px]]

The Hague Abduction Conventionentered into force in Colombia in 1996. According to the Convention Compliance Reports, Colombia ranks as one of the top ten destinations for the abduction of children from the United States. It has also been cited several times as a country demonstrating "patterns of noncompliance," being totally "noncompliant" and a "country of concern". In cases involving the Abduction Convention, recent legislation by the Colombian Congress has placed jurisdiction with the family courts. In remote areas of the country where there are no family courts, Hague Convention cases are heard by civil court circuit judges.  While Colombian courts can recognize or enforce U.S. custody orders, they generally refuse to do so and Colombian court orders prevail over foreign court orders.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Colombian courts favor parents of Colombian nationality and it is very rare for a court in Colombia to grant custody to a parent residing in the U.S. when there is a parent residing in Colombia.

International parental abduction is covered in the Colombian Penal Code as kidnapping, with circumstances that can increase or reduce the punishment. Colombia does not consider international parental kidnapping as an extraditable offense.

In contrast to United States requirements, a Colombian passport for a minor child can be obtained with only one parent's consent, though Colombia restricts the departure of Colombian children from the country when they are not in the company of both parents. Although this prevents misuse of a Colombian passport to abduct children from Colombia it facilitates abductions from countries like the United States who have no exit controls. If a parent wishes to prevent the issuance of a Colombian passport to their minor child, they  must submit a request to the Ministerio de la Proteccion Social, Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar (ICBF).  If the ICBF concurs with the parent's request, it will notify the Colombian passport office and Colombian Embassies and Consulates to place a hold on the issuance of a passport to the minor child.  Parents may only submit a request through ICBF, not through a Colombian Embassy or Consulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icbf.gov.co/icbf/directorio/portel/libreria/php/decide.php?patron=03 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406085525/https://www.icbf.gov.co/icbf/directorio/portel/libreria/php/decide.php?patron=03 |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_3057.html |title=MIG: International Parental Child Abduction Colombia |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Costa Rica====
[[File:Coat of arms of Costa Rica.svg|right|100px]]
Costa Rica has not ratified the Hague Abduction Convention and does not allow interstate enforcement of custody and visitation orders.&lt;!--would this be vice versa, i.e. the US not recognizing Costa rican court orders as well?--&gt; According to the US Department of state, Costa Rica is also well known to accept refugee applications from those mothers/fathers fleeing U.S. justice allowing abducting parents to claim some sort of legal problem with the US and seek asylum in Costa Rica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ticotimes.com/costa-rica/child-abduction-custody-laws|title=Costa Rica, Child Custody and Abduction Laws |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All children born in Costa Rica acquire Costa Rican citizenship at birth and, to prevent international child abduction, may only depart the country upon presentation of an exit permit issued by immigration authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1093.html|title=Costa Rica Country Specific Information |publisher=ticotimes.com |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dominican Republic====
[[File:Coat of arms of the Dominican Republic.svg|right|100px]]

In December 1997, the [[U.S. State Department]] targeted diplomatic entreaties at eight countries whose accession to the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] the Department judged would be most useful and effective to the United States, one of these was the [[Dominican Republic]].

The [[Dominican Republic]] signed and ratified the Abduction Convention in 2004 and it entered into force with the United States in 2007.  Since the treaty went into effect the Dominican Republic ranks in the top ten list of countries that are the source and destination of abducted children between the United States.

In their 2010 Compliance Report, the State Department added an outgoing child abduction case with the Dominican Republic to their new "Notable Cases" section.  They noted the Dominican Republic's Central authority evinced an "incorrect understanding of various articles of the Convention" and that requests for clarification from their Central Authority did not receive any substantive responses.

====Ecuador====
[[File:Coat of arms of Ecuador.svg|right|100px]]
The Hague Abduction Convention entered into force between [[Ecuador]] and the United States on March 1, 1992. Over the years Ecuador has been cited in a number of Compliance Reports as a "noncompliant" country or a country demonstrating a "pattern of noncompliance."  In the year period covered by the 2010 Report there were 24 children abducted from the U.S. to Ecuador and 7 children abducted from Ecuador to the U.S.

Ecuador has demonstrated noncompliance both in its judicial performance and its [[Central Authority]] performance. Convention case hearings are excessively delayed, in violation of the Convention’s principle of
promptly returning children to their habitual country of residence. In addition, courts treat cases as custody decisions, rather than a determination of the appropriate jurisdiction to decide custody.  Having delayed proceedings themselves, the courts of Ecuador have been known to determine that, due to the delay, children have resettled in their new environment.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Efforts of the United States to communicate about cases with the Ecuadorian Central Authority (ECA) for the Abduction Convention have not been effective with ECA consistently being unresponsive to the US Central Authority's (USCA) requests for case updates and copies of court rulings. The USCA is not aware of any efforts by the ECA to train judges about the Convention.&lt;!--is that a requirement under the convention? if so, it adds to the strength of the point to add it--&gt;&lt;ref name="2008 Compliance Report"/&gt;

====Honduras====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
[[File:Coat of arms of Honduras.svg|right|100px]]
The Hague Abduction Convention entered into force between [[Honduras]] and the United States in 1994.  Honduras is the only country to be listed in every singled Compliance Report as non-compliant since the reports began in 1999. The implementation of the Hague Convention in Honduras is broken on every level. It has an executive branch and legislature that is, at various times, unsure if it has actually signed the Convention. Its [[Central Authority]] sometimes does not exist at all{{clarify|date=January 2011}} and when it is reestablished does not fulfill any of its roles and is chronically understaffed.  The judiciary demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the treaty and, even in the rare case that a return order is issued, it is not enforced.

In 11 years of reporting on Convention compliance in Honduras there has not been a single case where a return was judicially ordered and enforced.  Like with Mexico, would be abductors of children to Honduras can legally{{dubious|date=January 2011}} take children across the southern land border without the permission of the other parent or even a passport.

The [[Hague Abduction Convention]] entered into force between [[Mexico]] and the United States in 1991.&lt;ref name="Hcch.net"/&gt; Mexico is the number one destination for international child abductions from the United States and the United States is the number one destination for children abducted from Mexico. The [[U.S. State Department]] reports that 65% of all outgoing international parental abductions from the United States to Hague Convention countries are to Mexico, and that 41% of all incoming international parental abductions to the United States are from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=4109|title=SPEECH OF Ernie Allen President &amp; CEO National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children Child Abductions: Globally, Nationally and Along the US/Mexico Border|publisher=Missingkids.com|date=2009-08-31|accessdate=2010-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224040247/http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=4109#|archive-date=2010-12-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexico is the only country that has been found to be "Noncompliant, "Not Fully Compliant" or having a "Pattern of Noncompliance" in every single [[United States Hague Abduction Convention Compliance Reports|Compliance Report]] compiled by the [[US Department of State]] since they began in 2001.

One of the primary roadblocks to Mexico's successful implementation of the Hague Abduction Convention is its inability to locate children.  This issue has been cited numerous times in the US State Department's annual Compliance Reports. In some cases, the US State Department has reported providing Mexican authorities with detailed information on the whereabouts of abducted children including the exact address where they are living but Mexican authorities still report an inability to locate the children. In late 2009 the Mexican Central Authority gave a presentation at an international symposium on international child abduction where they cited improvements in this area as a result of turning over the responsibility of locating children to the Mexican Federal Police (AFI), rather than exclusively using Interpol who has no authority and must request the involvement of Mexican law enforcement to take any real measures in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/de/Aussenpolitik/InternatRecht/Downloads/RedeLopez.pdf |title=THE EXPERIENCE OF MEXICO ON INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION |author=Reyna Aurora Martínez López |accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular relevance to Hague Convention litigation in Mexico is the Mexican [[Amparo (law)|Amparo]], which translates to "protection" or "help." It is a Mexican legal procedure to protect constitutional rights that was incorporated into the 1847 national constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Acta de Reformas, art. 25 (1847) (amending Constitution of 1824).&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexico's "''recurso de amparo''" is found in Articles 103 and 107 of the [[Mexican Constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.inquirer.net/express/07/09/03/html_output/xmlhtml/20070903-86232-xml.html The Mexican amparo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015062605/http://services.inquirer.net/express/07/09/03/html_output/xmlhtml/20070903-86232-xml.html |date=2010-10-15 }}, Joaquin G. Bernas, Inquirer.net. Accessed 20-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; Any Mexican citizen can file an amparo claiming that a Mexican authority is violating their constitutional rights.  Federal District courts are available in every state in Mexico and always have secretaries available to receive an Amparo.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  In cases of international child abduction an amparo can be filed at any point and effectively blocks progression of legal procedures until it has been heard, often many months, or even years later. The decision in an Amparo trial can also be further appealed and multiple amparos may be filed during legal proceedings under the Hague Convention.

Corruption is an intrinsic part of the problem with international child abduction in Mexico and affects every other aspect of the issue from locating children and judicial decisions to enforcing court orders for repatriation in the rare cases where the obstacles of locating children and judicial noncompliance have been overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegastribune.com//index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=683:judge-steel-opens-door |title=Judge Steel Opens the Door for Abduction |publisher=Las Vegas Tribune |date=2010-03-30  |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an Extradition Treaty between the United States of America and the United Mexican States (see 31 U.S.T. 5061) that, like many such treaties, provides for the extradition of a party who has been charged with or found guilty of an offense committed in one country. An offense is extraditable if it is a crime in both countries and punishable by incarceration for a period of one year or more. In theory this allows for the extradition of child abductors who have absconded to Mexico as child abduction is a federal crime there. In practice, US authorities rarely request extradition in preference of Hague Convention litigation, despite Mexico's gross noncompliance with the Convention and, even when they do, Mexico is not bound to deliver up its nationals and will frequently refuse to do so across the board, particularly in child abduction cases.

Additionally [[U.S.–Mexico border]] has the highest number of both legal and illegal crossings of any land border in the world.  Although the border is guarded on the United States' side by more than seventeen thousand border patrol agents, they only have "effective control" of less than 700 miles of the 1,954 mile border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Terence P. |last=Jeffrey |authorlink= |title=Administration Will Cut Border Patrol Deployed on U.S-Mexico Border |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/54514 |newspaper= |publisher=Cybercast News Service |date=24 September 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209091814/http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/54514 |archivedate=9 December 2009 |df= }} and&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathon |last=Shacat |authorlink= |title=Fewer border agents in south |url=http://www.svherald.com/articles/2009/09/25/news/doc4abc7145ddcf8256922136.txt |newspaper= |publisher=The Sierra Vista Herald |date=25 September 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of international child abduction from the US into Mexico specifically, the problem of poor border security in general is compounded by the fact the United States does not have exit controls;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/family/abduction/prevention/prevention_560.html |title=US State Department: Child Abduction Prevention |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408015216/http://travel.state.gov/family/abduction/prevention/prevention_560.html |archivedate=2010-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; American children may be taken across the southern border of the United States without having the necessary documentation to get back into the country and there is no accounting for children taken across the border into Mexico, leading to thousands of missing children posters with the words "may have traveled to Mexico" on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=missing+"may+have+traveled+to+Mexico"|title=missing "may have traveled to Mexico" - Google Search|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Panama====
[[File:Coat of Arms of Panama.svg|right|100px]]
Panama’s performance in implementing the Convention was previously cited as “non-compliant”.  However, progress has been noted in Panama’s handling of its Convention responsibilities during the 2005 reporting period and the United States presently considers Panama to be “not fully compliant” in its implementation of the Convention.  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/hague_issues/hague_issues_2952.html |title=2006 Compliance Report |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Venezuela====
The Hague Abduction Convention entered into force between [[Venezuela]] and the United States at the start of 1997. According to the compliance Reports, Venezuela was cited as a country "non-compliant" with the Hague Convention in 2006 and as demonstrating "patterns of noncompliance" in 2008 and 2009. The Venezuelan [[Central Authority]] typically failed to be responsive to inquiries regarding abduction cases by the [[United States Department of State]], the US Embassy in Caracas, or victimized parents. Venezuelan judges often misinterpret return and access applications under the Convention as a request for them to determine custody or visitation rights and have been  observed to have a nationalistic bias in favor of the Venezuelan parent.

In addition, despite return orders issued by lower courts, the abducting parents can and do take advantage of prolonged appeals processes to significantly delay the return of children. These delays are particularly pronounced in cases in which the left-behind parent can not afford to retain a private attorney.  Without the use of a private attorney, cases take very long.

==United States Government handling of abduction cases==

The United States government generally, and the [[U.S. Department of State]] specifically, have been subject to sustained criticism for not doing enough to prevent the abduction of American children or support American parents of internationally abducted children in their recovery efforts.&lt;ref name="HalfTruth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.uoregon.edu/faculty/mweiner/docs/halftruth.pdf |title=HALF-TRUTHS, MISTAKES, AND EMBARRASSMENTS: THE UNITED STATES GOES TO THE FIFTH MEETING OF THE SPECIAL COMMISSION TO REVIEW THE OPERATION OF THE HAGUE CONVENTION ON THE CIVIL ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION |publisher=Utah Law Review |author=Merle H.

===United States Department of State===
{{further|Office of Children's Issues}}

American parents complain that they are essentially alone in dealing with foreign courts and legal systems.  The US State Department has a virtual monopoly on information in such cases, but refuses to act as a vigorous advocate for left-behind American parents while also preventing the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] or anyone else from playing that role. State Department attorney Thomas Johnson remarked that when he reminded one senior State Department official with Child Abduction Convention responsibilities that she works for the American people, her immediate response was: "I don’t work for the American people; I work for the Secretary of State",  demonstrating the Department’s inherent conflict of interest (i.e., a desire to maintain "good" bilateral foreign relations for their own sake that overrides assertive and effective advocacy on behalf of American citizens).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findthekids.org/pdf/johnson.pdf |title=THE HAGUE CHILD ABDUCTION CONVENTION: DIMINISHING RETURNS AND LITTLE TO CELEBRATE FOR AMERICANS |publisher=NYU Journal of International Law and Politics, 33 N.Y.U.

==== Dangerous Diplomacy ====

The journalist [[Joel Mowbray]] wrote the book "Dangerous Diplomacy" on the role and culture of the US State Department.  Mowbray's second chapter in "Dangerous Diplomacy", titled "Cold Shoulder: State's Smallest Victim's", is dedicated to an analysis of the assistance provided to American parents left in the wake of an international child abduction.  It describes State's overriding desire to appease foreign governments and maintain "good relations" as having a conflict of interest between their responsibility to internationally abducted children as the designated United States Central Authority under the Hague Convention.  This inherent conflict of interest between the two roles is magnified by what the book defines as the "culture of State", a culture characterized by extreme moral relativism, valuing process over substance and misplaced priorities that reward failures by promotions or high paying jobs "consulting" for the foreign government of the country that they'd previously been paid to advocate America's interests in.&lt;ref name="dangerous"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dangerous Diplomacy |author=Joel Mowbray |ISBN=0-89526-110-3|year=2003 |publisher=Regnery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extracts from Congressional testimony====

;[[Bernard W. Aronson]], Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs (1989–1993)&lt;ref name="TLC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bringseanhome.org/Bernard_Aronson_testimony.pdf |title=Statement of the Honorable Bernard Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs (1989-1993) |publisher=Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission |date=2009-12-02 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"..the current system to secure the return of these abducted American children does not work and will not work unless it is changed profoundly.  I don't doubt the sincerity or the dedication of the professionals in the State Department who have lead responsibility for this problem, but they do not have the tools and powers to do their job effectively.  And unless Congress gives them the power and the tools we will be back here in five years or 10 years with another set of hearings, another group of parents with broken hearts and devastated dreams, and we will be making the same statements we are making today."

"the principal reason other nations, whether they are signatories to the Hague Convention or not, refuse to cooperate with the United States in returning abducted American children is that there are no real consequences for failing to do so."

"Let me be blunt, a diplomatic request for which there are no consequences for refusal is just a sophisticated version of begging.  And there are no consequences today for Brazil or any other nation which refuses to return American children."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35247">'''Interpersonal emotion regulation''' is the process of changing the emotional experience of one's self or another person through social interaction. It encompasses both '''intrinsic emotion regulation''' (also known as [[emotional self-regulation]]), in which one attempts to alter their own feelings by recruiting social resources, as well as '''extrinsic emotion regulation''', in which one deliberately attempts to alter the trajectory of other people's feelings.

== History of concept ==
The concept of interpersonal emotion regulation stems from earlier research into [[emotional self-regulation]], which is the within-person process whereby people influence and change their own feelings.&lt;ref name="Gross2"&gt;Gross, J. J. (1998). The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review. Review of general psychology, 2, 271-299.&lt;/ref&gt;  The field of psychology has traditionally focused on ''intra''personal processes in which a person manages their own emotions individually outside of the social context&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barthel|first=Abigail L.|last2=Hay|first2=Aleena|last3=Doan|first3=Stacey N.|last4=Hofmann|first4=Stefan G.|date=2018-10-18|title=Interpersonal Emotion Regulation: A Review of Social and Developmental Components|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/bec.2018.19|journal=Behaviour Change|pages=1–14|doi=10.1017/bec.2018.19|issn=0813-4839}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, modern theories have expanded the concept of emotion regulation to include ''inter''personal processes, in which emotion is regulated with or through other people. Interpersonal models emphasize that humans are social creatures who rarely experience emotions in isolation, and instead more commonly share, express, and manage their emotions with the help of others.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckes|first=Lane|last2=Coan|first2=James A.|date=2011|title=Social Baseline Theory: The Role of Social Proximity in Emotion and Economy of Action|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00400.x|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|language=en|volume=5|issue=12|pages=976–988|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00400.x|issn=1751-9004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zaki|first=Jamil|last2=Williams|first2=W.

== Concept ==

=== Intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation ===
Intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation involves managing one's own emotions through social interaction&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;, such as seeking [[social support]] or [[reassurance]] from others. Examples include calling a friend for advice, venting to a partner about a stressful situation, or engaging in conversation as a distraction from distress. In addition to regulating negative emotions, people also seek to amplify positive emotions by sharing good news with others. As with intrapersonal emotion regulation, people typically attempt to use interpersonal emotion regulation improve their affective state by decreasing negative emotions or increase positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsai|first=Jeanne L.|date=2007|title=Ideal Affect: Cultural Causes and Behavioral Consequences|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1111%2Fj.1745-6916.2007.00043.x|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=242–259|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00043.x|issn=1745-6916|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Extrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation ===
Extrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation refers to the deliberate influence of others' [[emotion|feelings]].&lt;ref name="Niven"&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., &amp; Holman, D. (2009). A classification of controlled interpersonal affect regulation strategies. Emotion, 9, 498-509.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the many ways how social factors influence an individual's emotions&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, S. G. &amp; Doan, S. N. (2018). "The social foundations of emotion: Developmental, cultural, and clinical dimensions". Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. {{ISBN|978-1433829277}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Examples include trying to cheer up a friend who is upset, trying to make one's partner feel guilty for neglecting oneself, or trying to calm a stressed coworker. These examples illustrate that interpersonal emotion regulation may be used to make others feel better or worse, although making others feel better appears to be far more common.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== In groups ===
Many instances of interpersonal emotion regulation, such as those described above, are dyadic; in other words, they involve one person trying to influence the feelings of another person. However, interpersonal emotion regulation can occur between larger social groups. For example, in the workplace a leader might try to influence the feelings of a whole group of followers to make them feel more enthusiastic and motivated.&lt;ref&gt;George, J. M. (2000). Emotions and leadership: The role of emotional intelligence. Human relations, 53, 1027-1055.&lt;/ref&gt; Or in support groups, the whole group might work together to influence the feelings of a member to make the member feel less anxious or depressed.&lt;ref&gt;Thoits, P. A. (1996). Managing the emotions of others. Symbolic Interaction, 19, 85-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpersonal emotion regulation is used in most of the important social relationships that we have. Within the fields of developmental and clinical [[psychology]], researchers have long-recognized that people try to influence others' emotions (e.g., mothers influence the feelings of their babies,&lt;ref&gt;Field, T. (1994). The effects of mothers' physical and emotional unavailability on emotion regulation. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 59, 208-227.&lt;/ref&gt; therapists try to alleviate the sadness of their clients&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, H. C., Barkham, M., Stiles, W. B., &amp; Goldfried, M. R. (2002). Patterns of client emotion in helpful sessions of cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy. Journal of counseling psychology, 49, 376-380.&lt;/ref&gt;). More recently, social and organizational psychologists have also documented the use of interpersonal emotion regulation within romantic and familial relationships&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Macdonald, I., &amp; Holman, D. (2012). You spin me right round: Cross-relationship variability in interpersonal emotion regulation. Frontiers in Psychology, 3, 394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vangelisti, A. L., Daly, J. A., &amp; Rudnick, J. R. (1991). Making people feel guilty in conversations: Techniques and correlates. Human Communication Research, 18, 3-39.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a range of work settings (e.g., hospitals,&lt;ref&gt;Francis, L. E., Monahan, K., &amp; Berger, C. (1999). A laughing matter? The uses of humor in medical interactions. Motivation and Emotion, 23, 154-177.&lt;/ref&gt; law firms,&lt;ref&gt;Lively, K. J. (2000). Reciprocal emotion management: Working together to maintain stratification in private law firms. Work and Occupations, 27, 32-63.&lt;/ref&gt; debt collection agencies,&lt;ref name="Sutton"&gt;Sutton, R. I. (1991). Maintaining norms about expressed emotions: The case of bill collectors. Administrative Science Quarterly, 36, 245-268.&lt;/ref&gt; and prisons&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., &amp; Holman, D. (2007). Changing moods and influencing people: The use and effects of emotional influence behaviours at HMP Grendon. Prison Service Journal, 173, 39-45.&lt;/ref&gt;). Interpersonal emotion regulation may even be used towards complete strangers as a way of making social interactions run more smoothly.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, S. E., &amp; Eggleston, R. (1994). Managing emotions in public: The case of wheelchair users. Social Psychology Quarterly, 57, 300-312.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Related processes ===

Interpersonal emotion regulation overlaps with [[social support]], which involves giving others emotional, informational, or practical support.&lt;ref&gt;House, J. S., &amp; Kahn, R. L. (1985). Measures and concepts of social support. In S. Cohen and S. L. Syme (Eds.), Social support and health (pp. 79-108). Orlando, FL: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Models of interpersonal emotion regulation specify social support within the framework of regulatory goals to improve the feelings of one's self (by seeking support) or another person (by providing support). Emotion regulation mechanisms of social support include attentional deployment (e.g. distraction away from negative thoughts and toward the conversation) and cognitive change (e.g. encouragement to "look on the bright side" or change one's negative interpretation of a given situation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marroquín|first=Brett|date=2011|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation as a mechanism of social support in depression|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1276–1290|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|issn=0272-7358|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpersonal emotion regulation also shares links with other processes by which people come to influence others' emotions, such as [[emotional contagion]], in which the emotions of one person are 'caught' by another person as a result of mere contact (e.g., if someone was having a terrible day, they might 'infect' their friends with their bad mood).&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, E., Cacioppo, J. T., &amp; Rapson, R. L. (1993). Emotional contagion. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 2, 96-99.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the compulsion to tell other people about our emotional experiences (termed the [[social sharing of emotions]]) can also result in other people coming to feel what we feel.&lt;ref&gt;Rimé, B., Finkenauer, C., Luminet, O., Zech, E., &amp; Philippot, P. (1998). Social sharing of emotion: New evidence and new questions. European review of social psychology, 9, 145-189.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between these processes and interpersonal emotion regulation regards the [[Automatic and Controlled Processes (ACP)|level of processing]] involved. Interpersonal emotion regulation is a controlled process, whereby a person intentionally tries to change the way others feel. In contrast, emotional contagion is thought to be relatively [[automaticity|automatic]], engaged without conscious awareness, while social sharing is somewhat more conscious but typically lacks the intent to influence others' emotions.

Interpersonal emotion regulation relates to [[emotional labor]], the [[regulation of emotion]] as part of one's job role.&lt;ref&gt;Grandey, A. A. (2000). Emotion regulation in the workplace: A new way to conceptualize emotional labor. Journal of occupational health psychology, 5, 95-110.&lt;/ref&gt; In emotional labor, an employee (usually in a service or care role) is required to manage his or her emotions as part of the job (e.g., 'service with a smile'). Because employees can also be required to manage the emotions of their customers or clients as part of their job (e.g., debt collectors are required to elicit anxiety in relaxed debtors to encourage them to make a payment&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;), interpersonal emotion regulation can be performed as a form of emotional labor.&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Holman, D., &amp; Cameron, D. (2012). Emotional labor at the unit-level. In A. Grandey, J. Diefendorff, &amp; D. Rupp (Eds.), Emotional labor in the 21st century: Diverse perspectives on emotion regulation at work. Psychology Press/Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related process is interpersonal influence, which involves trying to change the attitudes and/or behaviors of other people.&lt;ref&gt;Kipnis, D., Schmidt, S. M., &amp; Wilkinson, I. (1980). Intraorganizational influence tactics: Exploration of getting one's way. Journal of Applied Psychology, 65, 440-452.&lt;/ref&gt; The key difference here is that interpersonal emotion regulation is primarily concerned with changing other people's feelings; any changes to attitudes or behaviors are secondary to the impact on emotion.

== Theories ==

=== Social Baseline Theory ===
Drawing from [[evolutionary psychology]], '''social baseline theory''' purports that humans have adapted to function in a social environment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coan, J., &amp; Maresh, E. L. (2013). Social baseline theory and the social regulation of emotion. In J. Gross (Ed.), Handbook of emotion regulation (2nd ed.). New York, NY: Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt; The brain acts under the assumption that proximity to other people is the norm, or baseline condition. As opposed to social isolation, which is associated with stress and poor health, social proximity is associated with attenuated cardiovascular, hormonal, and neural responses to threat, as well as longevity and physical health. The presence of others is theorized to help individuals conserve effort and metabolic resources through the social regulation of emotion. For example, the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] is less active during the down-regulation of negative affect while the presence of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisenberger|first=Naomi I.|last2=Taylor|first2=Shelley E.|last3=Gable|first3=Shelly L.|last4=Hilmert|first4=Clayton J.|last5=Lieberman|first5=Matthew D.|date=2007|title=Neural pathways link social support to attenuated neuroendocrine stress responses|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.01.038|journal=NeuroImage|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1601–1612|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.01.038|issn=1053-8119|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coan|first=James A.|last2=Schaefer|first2=Hillary S.|last3=Davidson|first3=Richard J.|date=2006|title=Lending a Hand|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01832.x|journal=Psychological Science|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1032–1039|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01832.x|issn=0956-7976|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social proximity is hypothesized to confer emotion regulatory benefits through three mechanisms: 1) risk distribution, 2) load sharing, and 3) capitalization. Risk distribution lowers [[Vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] towards threat because risks seem lower as group size increases. Load sharing involves the knowledge that close others can provide help and resources if needed. Finally, capitalization refers to the intensification of positive emotions when they are shared with others.

=== Map of Interpersonal Regulation ===
A prominent model proposed by Jamil Zaki and Craig Williams (2013) conceptualizes different classes of interpersonal emotion regulation along two orthogonal dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zaki|first=Jamil|last2=Williams|first2=W. Craig|date=2013|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0033839|journal=Emotion|volume=13|issue=5|pages=803–810|doi=10.1037/a0033839|issn=1931-1516}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, intrinsic ''vs'' extrinsic, refers to the target of regulatory efforts. Intrinsic regulation involves an attempt to change one's own emotions through social contact, while extrinsic regulation involves trying to change the emotions of another person or group of people. The second dimension, response-dependent vs. response-independent, refers to whether or not the regulatory efforts depend upon the behavior of other people. Processes that rely upon how others respond or behave are considered response-dependent, while strategies that do not depend upon others' behavior are classified as response-independent. This model yields four classes of interpersonal emotion regulation:

# Intrinsic response-dependent: An individual tries to change their own affect through interaction with another person, whose feedback impacts the regulatory attempt. [[Safety behaviors (anxiety)|Safety behaviors]] fall into this category. For example, to alleviate anxiety a child might seek comfort from his mother, who responds in a soothing manner. Some forms of [[Social sharing of emotions|social sharing]] can also be considered an intrinsic response-dependent strategy, insofar as the listener's feedback influences the speaker's affect. For instance, sharing good news can intensify one's positive affect, but only if the listener responds enthusiastically.
# Intrinsic response-independent: Processes in this category involve attempts to alter one's own emotional experience through social contact, but the regulatory success does not depend upon how others react or behave. Affect labeling, or putting feelings into words, can dampen the intensity of emotional experience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torre|first=Jared B.|last2=Lieberman|first2=Matthew D.|date=2018-03-20|title=Putting Feelings Into Words: Affect Labeling as Implicit Emotion Regulation|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1754073917742706|journal=Emotion Review|volume=10|issue=2|pages=116–124|doi=10.1177/1754073917742706|issn=1754-0739}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly occurs during communication in social contexts without necessarily relying on the response of others. For instance, describing one's emotions through a conversation may result in a more nuanced understanding of one's feelings that facilitates coping.
# Extrinsic response-dependent: A person acts with the goal of changing another person's emotion, whose feedback plays an important role in indicating the success of the regulatory attempt. Examples include [[prosocial behavior]] and related processes such as [[Empathy|empathic]] responding that endeavor to improve other people's affective state. Feedback from the recipient is needed to signal whether or not they were helped.
# Extrinsic response-independent: This classification includes attempts to change another person's affective experience that to not depend upon that person's feedback. For example, [[Warm-glow giving|warm glow]] giving may result in the achieved extrinsic goal of engaging in prosocial behavior without receiving cues from the recipient as to whether or not they benefitted.

== Strategies ==

There are potentially hundreds of strategies that people can use to influence others' feelings. A series of studies reported by Niven and colleagues generated almost 400 unique strategies that could be differentiated primarily according to whether they are used to improve or to worsen others' feelings.&lt;ref name="Niven" /&gt; Another key distinction is between strategies that engage a person in the specific situation that has caused the emotion (e.g., trying to get the person to see a situation in a different light) and those that divert attention away (e.g., joking with the person).

Research based on Niven and colleagues' classification has indicated that these distinct strategy types have different effects on the well-being of the people who use them and also on the people who they are used towards.&lt;ref&gt;Martínez-Íñigo, D., Poerio, G. L., &amp; Totterdell, P. (2013). The association between controlled interpersonal affect regulation and resource depletion. Applied Psychology: Health and Well-being.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Holman, D., &amp; Headley, T. (2012). Does regulating others' feelings influence people's own affective well-being? Journal of Social Psychology, 152, 246-260.&lt;/ref&gt; They may even have different implications for the quality of the relationship between these two parties.&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Holman, D., &amp; Totterdell, P. (2012). How to win friendship and trust by influencing people: An investigation of interpersonal affect regulation and the quality of relationships. Human Relations, 65, 777-805.&lt;/ref&gt;

A different way of distinguishing interpersonal emotion regulation strategies is according to the stage of the emotion that they focus on. Inspired by James Gross's process model of emotion,&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;Gross, J. J. (1998). The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review. Review of general psychology, 2, 271-299.&lt;/ref&gt; some researchers have suggested that there is a difference between strategies that try to change the underlying emotion someone is feeling and strategies that try to change the emotion that the person expresses outwardly.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M. (2007). Building genuine trust through interpersonal emotion management: A threat regulation model of trust and collaboration across boundaries.

Customer‐Focused Emotion Management Strategies. Personnel Psychology, 66, 261-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In psychopathology ==
Patterns of interpersonal emotion dysregulation may contribute to the onset and maintenance of mental health disorders.

=== Anxiety disorders ===
[[Anxiety disorder|Anxiety disorders]] are perpetuated by avoidance of feared stimuli. [[Avoidance coping|Avoidance]] behaviors can include the presence of "safety people", who reduce the anxious individual's distress while [[Negative Reinforcement|negatively reinforcing]] the avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofmann|first=Stefan G.|date=2014-05-23|title=Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Model of Mood and Anxiety Disorders|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10608-014-9620-1|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=38|issue=5|pages=483–492|doi=10.1007/s10608-014-9620-1|issn=0147-5916}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an individual with panic disorder may ask her partner to drive her to work, which alleviates her fear of having a panic attack while driving. This pattern may lead to reliance upon others and contribute to continued avoidance (e.g. of driving a car alone). Another interpersonal strategy used in anxiety disorders is reassurance seeking. For example, someone with [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsive disorder]] may rely upon a roommate to assure them that the doors have been locked, or an individual with [[generalized anxiety disorder]] may ask a romantic partner for reassurances of love.

=== Depression ===
Individuals with depression experience maladaptive interpersonal interactions, which contribute to their depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammen|first=Constance|date=2018-06-07|title=Stress Generation and Depression|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190681777.013.15|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190681777.013.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors include greater expressed negativity (e.g. criticism, blaming, demanding, and disengagement) toward romantic partners,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davila|first=Joanne|last2=Bradbury|first2=Thomas N.|last3=Cohan|first3=Catherine L.|last4=Tochluk|first4=Shelly|date=1997|title=Marital functioning and depressive symptoms: Evidence for a stress generation model.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.73.4.849|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=73|issue=4|pages=849–861|doi=10.1037//0022-3514.73.4.849|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; and negative feedback seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swann|first=William B.|last2=Wenzlaff|first2=Richard M.|last3=Krull|first3=Douglas S.|last4=Pelham|first4=Brett W.|date=1992|title=Allure of negative feedback: Self-verification strivings among depressed persons.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0021-843x.101.2.293|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=101|issue=2|pages=293–306|doi=10.1037//0021-843x.101.2.293|issn=0021-843X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive reassurance seeking is also a vulnerability factor for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joiner|first=Thomas E.|last2=Metalsky|first2=Gerald I.|date=2001-09|title=Excessive Reassurance Seeking: Delineating a Risk Factor Involved in the Development of Depressive Symptoms|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.00369|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=12|issue=5|pages=371–378|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00369|issn=0956-7976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osborne|first=David W.

According to the [[Biosocial theory|biosocial model]],&lt;ref&gt;Linehan, M. M. (1993). Cognitive-behavioral treatment of borderline personality disorder. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; individuals with [[borderline personality disorder]] develop intense emotional expression in part because they have been reinforced throughout development. For instance, a teenager with heightened emotional sensitivity is not taken seriously by her family until she threatens a suicide attempt. If her family responds with attention to extreme emotional expressions, she will learn to continue to express emotions in this way. Venting is another interpersonal emotion regulation strategy that is associated with personality disorder symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vollrath|first=Margarete|last2=Alnæs|first2=Randolf|last3=Torgersen|first3=Svenn|date=1998|title=Coping Styles Predict Change in Personality Disorders*|url=https://guilfordjournals.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fguilfordjournals.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1521%2Fpedi.1998.12.3.198|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders|language=en-US|volume=12|issue=3|pages=198–209|doi=10.1521/pedi.1998.12.3.198|issn=0885-579X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dixon-Gordon|first=Katherine L.|last2=Haliczer|first2=Lauren A.|last3=Conkey|first3=Lindsey C.|last4=Whalen|first4=Diana J.|date=2018|title=Difficulties in Interpersonal Emotion Regulation: Initial Development and Validation of a Self-Report Measure|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10862-018-9647-9|journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|volume=40|issue=3|pages=528–549|doi=10.1007/s10862-018-9647-9|issn=0882-2689|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychotherapy ===
Certain types of psychotherapy target interpersonal factors to improve well-being. [[Dialectical behavior therapy|Dialectical behavioral therapy]], originally developed for individuals with [[borderline personality disorder]], teaches clients interpersonal effectiveness, which includes a variety of skills for communicating emotions in a clear and socially acceptable manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Thomas R.|last2=Trost|first2=William T.|last3=Salsman|first3=Nicholas|last4=Linehan|first4=Marsha M.|date=2007|title=Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Borderline Personality Disorder|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095229|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=181–205|doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095229|issn=1548-5943|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assertiveness|Assertiveness training]] is a behavioral intervention that teaches verbal and non-verbal assertiveness skills to inhibit anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frank|first=Jerome D.|date=1958|title=Psychotherapy by Reciprocal Inhibition by Joseph Wolpe|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/pbm.1958.0006|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|volume=2|issue=1|pages=123–125|doi=10.1353/pbm.1958.0006|issn=1529-8795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment measures ==

Several questionnaires have been developed to measure people's self-reported use of interpersonal emotion regulation, including the Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS),&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Stride, C., &amp; Holman, D. (2011). Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS): The development and validation of a new individual difference measure.

=== Emotion Regulation of Others and Self ===
The Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS) questionnaire &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Stride, C., &amp; Holman, D. (2011). Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS): The development and validation of a new individual difference measure. Current Psychology, 30, 53-73.&lt;/ref&gt; is a freely available measure that assess strategies used to improve or worsen either one's own or another person's emotions, yielding a two-by-two framework: 1) intrinsic affect-improving, 2) intrinsic affect-worsening, 3) extrinsic affect-improving, and 4) extrinsic affect-worsening. The ''intrinsic'' subscale measures [[emotion self-regulation]] using 10 items. The ''extrinsic'' subscale measures deliberate attempts to improve or worsen others' emotions using 9 items.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erosresearch.org/index.php/resources/tools/&lt;/ref&gt; There is low item endorsement for the affect-worsening dimension, suggesting that people rarely make deliberate attempts to worsen their own or others' emotions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, extrinsic affect-worsening is associated with health-related impairments, suggesting detrimental effects of engaging in these strategies likely due to negative social repercussions. Additionally, the affect-improving factor is unrelated to current levels of affect, which may be attributed to the scale's [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] properties or to a discrepancy between current mood state and strategy use (e.g., reporting use of affect-improving strategies more often while in a negative mood state).

=== Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire ===
The Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (IERQ)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hofmann, S. G., Carpenter, J. K., &amp; Curtiss, J. (2016). Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (IERQ): Scale development and psychometric characteristics. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 40, 341-356. doi: 0.1007/s10608-016-9756-2.&lt;/ref&gt; is a 20-item measure designed to assess how individuals regulate their own emotions through the use of others. The questionnaire was developed through [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] interviews with participants (e.g., "When you are feeling down, in what ways do you look to other people to help you feel better?"), whose responses were [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] tested using exploratory and confirmatory [[factor analysis]] to derive 4 factors containing 5 items each. The 4 factors include Enhancing Positive Affect (seeking social interaction to enhance happiness), Perspective Taking (recruiting others to point out that other people are in a worse situation), Soothing (seeking comfort and sympathy from others), and Social Modeling (observing others for examples of how to cope).

=== Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire ===
The Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire (IRQ)&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=W. Craig|last2=Morelli|first2=Sylvia A.|last3=Ong|first3=Desmond C.|last4=Zaki|first4=Jamil|date=2018|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation: Implications for affiliation, perceived support, relationships, and well-being.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000132|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=115|issue=2|pages=224–254|doi=10.1037/pspi0000132|issn=1939-1315|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 16-item measure of intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation that assesses individuals' ''tendency'' to recruit social resources in response to emotional events, as well as their perceived [[Self-efficacy|''efficacy'']] of how effective interpersonal strategies are in improving their emotional experiences. Because it is a less common for individuals to deliberately worsen their mood,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliot|first=Andrew J.|last2=Thrash|first2=Todd M.|date=2002|title=Approach-avoidance motivation in personality: Approach and avoidance temperaments and goals.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.82.5.804|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=82|issue=5|pages=804–818|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.82.5.804|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt; the measure focuses on increasing positive emotions and decreasing negative emotions. High interpersonal emotion regulation tendency and efficacy is related to greater emotional expressivity, empathy, social connectedness, and supportive relationships.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Individuals who score high on efficacy are more likely to benefit from social support.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Difficulties in Interpersonal Regulation of Emotion ===
The Difficulties in Interpersonal Regulation of Emotion (DIRE)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is a self-report measure of maladaptive interpersonal emotion regulation strategies that may relate to [[psychopathology]]. Respondents rate how likely they would be to use a variety of strategies in response to three vignettes about stressful hypothetical scenarios (task-oriented, romantic, social). The DIRS consists of four factors, including two intrapersonal (Accept, Avoid) and two interpersonal (Reassurance-seek, Vent) classes of strategies. Reassurance-seeking is related to overall emotion dysregulation, as well as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]] symptoms. Both reassurance-seeking and venting are associated with negative affect, interpersonal problems, stress, and [[borderline personality disorder]] symptoms.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12239">In modern usage, metric is used almost exclusively in commercial transactions. These units are mostly historical, although they are still used in some limited contexts and in Maltese idioms and set phrases. Many of these terms are directly related to [[Ancient Arabic weights and measures|Arabic units]] and some to Sicilian units.  The ''Weights and Measures Ordinance'' of 1921 established uniformity in the conversion of such weights and measures. All these measures were defined as simple multiples of the Imperial units then in use in Britain.

== Length ==

Length units were typically used for measuring goods and building sizes. Distances were traditionally measured in terms of travel time, which explains the lack of large-scale units.

=== Land ===

In 1921, these units were redefined with respect to the British Imperial standard. These values reflect this change.

== Volume ==

These units were all (except for the cubic units) defined in 1921 relative to the British Imperial gallon, which was defined in the 1824 act. This is equal to 10 pounds of water at a specified temperature and air pressure. This (~4.546 090 31 litres) is slightly larger than the modern definition (exactly 4.546 09 litres).

=== Beer, wine, and spirits measure ===

None of the units from this group are mentioned in TY Maltese.

== Mass ==

All the Maltese mass units were redefined relative to the British Imperial ton in 1921. Before this, the units were presumably based on an Arabic standard. All equivalent measures listed in pounds below are exact values.

nb. There are two distinct units which are named ''kwart''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12870">The phrase '''man bites dog''' is a shortened version of an [[aphorism]] in [[journalism]] which describes how an unusual, infrequent event (such as a man biting a dog) is more likely to be reported as news than an ordinary, everyday occurrence with similar consequences, such as a [[dog bite|dog biting a man]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues/ Owen Spencer-Thomas  ''News Values''. Accessed October 15, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; An event is usually considered more newsworthy if there is something unusual about it; a commonplace event is less likely to be seen as newsworthy, even if the consequences of both events have objectively similar outcomes. The result is that rarer events more often appear as news stories, while more common events appear less often, thus distorting the perceptions of news consumers of what constitutes normal rates of occurrence.

The phenomenon is also described in the journalistic saying, "You never read about a plane that did not crash".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06257/721583-152.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=There's news in planes that don't crash | date=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was coined by [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe]] (1865–1922), a British newspaper magnate, but is also attributed to ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' editor John B. Bogart (1848–1921): "When a dog bites a man, that is not news, because it happens so often. But if a man bites a dog, that is news."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', 16th edition, ed. Justin Kaplan (Boston, London, and Toronto: Little, Brown, 1992), p. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Luther Mott]] (1941) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=G3tWmzirWwoC American Journalism. A History of Newspapers in the United States through 250 Years, 1690 to 1940]''&lt;/ref&gt; The quote is also attributed to [[Charles Anderson Dana]] (1819–1897).&lt;ref&gt;Recollections of the Civil War By Charles Anderson Dana, Charles E. Rankin pp. xvi, xix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Dushenko, K.

In [[philosophy]], '''meta-rights''' are the [[entitlement]]s of individuals to their [[rights]], including the possibility to [[waive]], transfer or sell their rights. When we talk of the rights of individuals, we do not always distinguish between rights which can be waived or sold and rights which are non-negotiable. Yet that distinction and often the distinction is made implicitly. When we say a person has a right to her house, we usually mean that she also has the meta right to sell the right. On the other hand, when we say a person has the right to his body parts, we usually assume this comes without the accompanying meta right to sell these rights. Economic efficiency usually comes with having rights which come together with the meta right to sell the right. It is arguable that we should be much more explicit about when rights come together with meta rights and when without, and the moral basis that accompany these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaushik Basu |title=The right to give up rights |journal=Economica |volume=51 |year=1984|doi=10.2307/2554226 |jstor=2554226 |pages=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/basic-rights-and-meta-rights#axzz2SSpJJAeL&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd et al. v. Republic of Zimbabwe'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SAFLII|litigants=Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd and Others v Republic of Zimbabwe|link=|court=SADCT|year=2008|num=2|parallelcite=|date=28 November 2008|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a case decided by the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) Tribunal (hereinafter "the Tribunal"). The Tribunal held that the [[Zimbabwe]]an government violated the organisation's treaty by denying access to the courts and engaging in racial discrimination against [[White people in Zimbabwe|white]] farmers whose lands had been confiscated under the [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform program in Zimbabwe]].

==Background==
Land reform in Zimbabwe began after the signing of the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] in 1979 in an effort to more equitably distribute land between the historically disenfranchised blacks and the minority whites. Government-orchestrated land invasions began in February 2000.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;[http://www.swradioafrica.com/Documents/Campb040609.pdf Zimbabwean Farm Test Case timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; The Zimbabwean government formally announced a "fast track" resettlement program in July 2000, stating that it would acquire more than 3,000 farms for redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2002/zimbabwe/ZimLand0302-02.htm#P112_20168 ''Fast Track Land Reform in Zimbabwe, Human Rights Watch'', March 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1970s Campbell, a [[South African Army]] captain, had been involved in the [[Rhodesian Bush War]] that pitted [[Rhodesia]]'s mostly white government—50 of the 66 parliamentary seats were reserved for whites—against black nationalist guerrillas. He moved to Mount Carmel farm in 1974. He added a neighbouring plot of land in 1980, following Zimbabwean independence. As well as farming, Campbell set up an extensive nature reserve on the property, replete with giraffes, [[impala]] and other indigenous animals. He also created the Biri River Safari Lodge, which became a popular tourist attraction.&lt;ref name=campbellobituary&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/8439131/Mike-Campbell.html Mike Campbell Obituary – ''The Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell purchased Mount Carmel from himself after independence. (The full title was vested in 1999, when the Zimbabwean government declared no interest in the land.)&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news

|date=20 April 2011
|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2001, amid large-scale land invasions by "war veterans", Campbell received a government notice to acquire Mount Carmel in the district of [[Chegutu]], but the notice was declared invalid by the High Court.&lt;ref name="hudleston2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The High Court is a superior court of record and has original jurisdiction over all criminal matters in Zimbabwe. [https://www.hrw.org/en/node/76100/section/5#_ftn16 Human Rights Watch, "Our Hands Are Tied", November 19, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2004, a new notice of intent to acquire Mount Carmel was published in the official Government Gazette, but no acquisition notice was actually issued. However, two months later, according to court filings, "persons purported to occupy the farm on behalf of [[Zanu PF]] spokesman Nathan Shamuyarira, claiming the former minister had been allocated the farm."&lt;ref name="hudleston2008"&gt;[http://www.zimbabwesituation.com/mar23_2008.html ''The Zimbabwe Situation'', "SADC to rule on farm seizure", March 22, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; After three more preliminary notices to take the farm were published in 2004, Campbell applied to the High Court for a protection order.&lt;ref name="hudleston2008" /&gt;

Amendment 17 was added to Zimbabwe's constitution on 14 September 2005 to vest ownership of certain categories of land on the Zimbabwean government and to eliminate the courts' [[jurisdiction]] to hear any challenge to the land acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceproject.org/regions-en/eisa/ZW/Constitution%20of%20Zimbabwe%201980.pdf Constitution of Zimbabwe as amended on February 1, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="saflii2008"&gt;[http://www.saflii.org/sa/cases/SADCT/2008/2.html Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd and Others v. Republic of Zimbabwe]&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell initiated proceedings in court on 15 May 2006, challenging the validity of Amendment 17.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="saflii2008" /&gt; In December 2006 the Gazetted Land (Consequential Provisions) Act passed into law, requiring all farmers whose land was compulsorily acquired by the government and who were not in possession of an official offer letter, permit, or lease, to cease to occupy, hold, or use that land within 45 days and to vacate their homes within 90 days.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; On 11 October 2007, before the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe had delivered its judgment in the case, Campbell filed an application with the SADC Tribunal challenging the acquisition by the Zimbabwean government. Subsequently, 77 other persons joined as parties in the proceedings against the government of Zimbabwe.

Mike Campbell, his wife Angela, and their son-in-law [[Ben Freeth]] were kidnapped, taken to an indoctrination camp and beaten by thugs on 29 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimbabwesituation.com/jun30a_2008.html "Farmer who exposed terror is kidnapped with family"], The Zimbabwe Situation, 30 June 2008. (Fourth article from the top of the page)&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell died on 6 April 2011; his family stated he died from complications of the 2008 beating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Decision by the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe==
The Supreme Court of Zimbabwe issued a decision in the case on 22 January 2008, dismissing Campbell's challenge.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.saflii.org/zw/cases/ZWSC/2008/1.html Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd. and Another v Minister of National Security Responsible for Land, Land Reform and Resettlement]'' (124/06) [2008] [[ZWSC]] 1 (22 January 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held that: (1) race was not an issue in the case, because neither the relevant provisions of Section 16B of the Constitution nor the land acquisitions made reference to race or color; (2) the Government of Zimbabwe has an inherent right to compulsorily acquire property, and (3) the legislature has full power to change the Constitution.&lt;ref name="zimsupct"&gt;Mike Campbell (Private) Limited v. The Minister of National Security Responsible for Land, Land Reform and Resettlement, Supreme Court of Zimbabwe, 22 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also stated that an "application to a court of law to challenge a lawful acquisition would in effect be an abuse of the right to protection of law."&lt;ref name="zimsupct" /&gt;

==The SADC Tribunal==
The Tribunal was established by the SADC treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sadc.int/index/browse/page/119#article16 Declaration and Treaty of the SADC.]&lt;/ref&gt; The SADC has been in existence since 1980, when it was formed as a loose alliance of nine majority-ruled States in Southern Africa known as the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC), with the main aim of co-ordinating development projects to lessen economic dependence on the then apartheid South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sadc.int/index/browse/page/52 SADC Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribunal ensures adherence to, and the proper interpretation of, the provisions of the Treaty and the subsidiary instruments made under it, and adjudicates upon disputes referred to it.&lt;ref name="saflii2008" /&gt;

==Decisions by the SADC Tribunal==
{{More footnotes|section|date=May 2012}}
The Tribunal concluded that it had jurisdiction to hear the case because the dispute concerned "human rights, democracy and the rule of law", which are binding principles for members of the SADC.&lt;ref name="saflii2008" /&gt;

'''17 December 2007'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Tribunal granted an [[interim]] measure ordering the government of Zimbabwe to take no steps, directly or indirectly, to evict Campbell from the farm or interfere with his use of the land.

'''28 November 2008'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Tribunal's decision on this date addressed four main issues: (1) Whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear the case; (2) whether the plaintiffs had been denied access to domestic courts in violation of the SADC Treaty; (3) whether the Zimbabwean government had discriminated against the plaintiffs on the basis of race, and (4) whether the plaintiffs were entitled to compensation. (1) The Tribunal held that it had jurisdiction to hear the case, because Amendment 17 had eliminated the plaintiffs' access to the domestic courts, and the plaintiffs were therefore entitled to seek remedy before the Tribunal. (2) The Tribunal found that the plaintiffs had been deprived of their right to a fair hearing before being deprived of their rights. (3) On the racial discrimination issue, the Tribunal held that the actions of the Zimbabwean government constituted indirect or "de facto" discrimination because implementation of Amendment 17 affected white farmers only. (4) Finally, the Tribunal held that the plaintiffs were entitled to compensation for the expropriation of their lands.

'''5 June 2009'''&lt;br /&gt;
After Campbell and another applicant, Richard Thomas Etheredge, filed a new application to declare the Government of Zimbabwe in [[contempt]], the Tribunal held that the Government of Zimbabwe had failed to comply with the Tribunal's previous decision.&lt;ref&gt;In the Matter Between William Michael Campbell, Richard Thomas Etheredge and The Republic of Zimbabwe, SADC Tribunal, 5 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribunal stated that it would report its finding to the Summit of the SADC.

==Post-decision developments==
'''Non-enforcement of the Tribunal's judgment''' &lt;br /&gt;
Mike Campbell applied to register the Tribunal's judgment of 28 November 2008 in the High Court on 23 December 2008, but the application was not accepted with no reasons given. Over a hundred prosecutions of white farmers continue because they remain on their lands.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; The High Court issued orders in April 2009 to evict the invaders on Mount Carmel, but nothing was done by the police to enforce the orders.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; No mention of the Tribunal's decision was made at the SADC's summit in early September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/middleeast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14465671 "Out with those white farmers"], ''The Economist'', 17 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Threats, intimidation and fires''' &lt;br /&gt;
After February 2009, Campbell and Freeth's families received threats from invaders. Campbell and his wife were eventually forced from their home and Mount Carmel was invaded.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; Ben Freeth's&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article6817665.ece "Farm owned by Ben Freeth, critic of Robert Mugabe, destroyed in fire"], ''Times Online'', 2 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mike Campbell's&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/zimbabwean-farmer-besieged-but-defiant/article1273872 "Zimbabwean farmer besieged but defiant"], ''The Globe and Mail'', 17 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; homesteads were destroyed in fires on 30 August 2009 and 2 September 2009, respectively.

'''Zimbabwe denies the legitimacy of the Tribunal''' &lt;br /&gt;
Zimbabwe's Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa wrote to the Tribunal to inform of Zimbabwe's withdrawal from the Tribunal in a letter written on 7 August 2009, arguing that it did not have jurisdiction over Zimbabwe because the Tribunal's Protocol has not yet been ratified by two-thirds of the total members of the SADC, as required by the organisation's treaty,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezimbabwetimes.com/?p=22107 "Zimbabwe withdraws from SADC Tribunal"], ''The Zimbabwe Times'', 2 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.amnestyusa.org/justice/sadc-tribunal-struggles-for-legitimacy "SADC Tribunal Struggles for Legitimacy"], Amnesty International USA Web Log, 3 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that Zimbabwe would no longer be bound by any of the Tribunal's past or future judgments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezimbabwean.co.uk/2009090324142/weekday-top-stories/chinamasa-pulls-zim-out-of-sadc-tribunal-without-cabinet-approval.html "Chinamasa pulls Zim out of SADC tribunal without cabinet approval"], ''The Zimbabwean'', 3 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2011}}

'''Decision by the High Court not to register the SADC Tribunal's judgement in Zimbabwe''' &lt;br /&gt;
Judge Patel of the High Court issued a decision&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubatana.net/docs/landr/high_court_patel_gramara_goz_100126.pdf Text of Judge Patel's decision (High Court)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swradioafrica.com/pages/sadctribunal250110.htm#summary Summary of Judge Patel's decision.]&lt;/ref&gt; on 26 January 2010 in which he held that the SADC Tribunal was properly constituted and had jurisdiction to hear Campbell's case, but its decision could not be registered for purposes of enforcement. Judge Patel's decision relied on two main reasons. First, the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe had confirmed the constitutionality of the land reform program, and registering the SADC Tribunal's judgment in Zimbabwe would challenge the Supreme Court's decision and undermine its authority; this would be contrary to public policy. Second, if the Zimbabwean government complied with the SADC Tribunal's decision, it would contravene section 16B of the Constitution (introduced by Amendment 17 in 2005, see [[Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd and Others v Republic of Zimbabwe#Background|above]]); this could not be allowed because the Constitution is the supreme law of Zimbabwe.

'''The SADC Summit orders a review of the role, functions and terms of the SADC Tribunal''' &lt;br /&gt;
On 17 August 2010 the Summit of the SADC heads of state and government decided "that a review of the role functions and terms [sic] of reference of the SADC Tribunal should be undertaken and concluded within 6 months."&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;{{cite news

In a draft report&lt;ref&gt;''Review of the Role, Responsibilities and Terms of Reference of the SADC Tribunal'', WTI Advisors, Dr. Lorand Bartels, 14 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;commissioned by the SADC and dated 14 February 2011, WTI Advisors (an affiliate of the World Trade Institute) recommended, among other things, the following: SADC Member States should ensure that they give the force of law to SADC law by amending national law; Member States should consider amending the SADC Treaty to state that SADC law is supreme over national law, including constitutional law; the Tribunal should be given power to determine its own Rules of Procedure; the Tribunal's Protocol should be amended to provide that membership and rights of Member States may be suspended, with the Summit taking account of the possible consequences of suspension; the Tribunal should be able to order remedies (including fines) for non-compliance.

'''Legal action against heads of State''' &lt;br /&gt;
In April 2011 Mike Campbell, his company Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd, and another farmer, Luke Tembani, applied to the courts for an order against the 'Summit of the Heads of State or Government of SADC' and the presidents of 15 member countries, the Council of Ministers of SADC, and the Republic of Zimbabwe, demanding that ''the [SADC] Tribunal continues to function in all respects as established by Article 16 of the Treaty''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zimbabwereporter.com/politics/2959.html Evicted Zimbabwean farmers sue SADC leaders for dissolving Tribunal] Zimbabwe Reporter, published 2011-04-04&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Compensation battle in South Africa''' &lt;br /&gt;
On 6 June 2011, the [[North Gauteng High Court]] in [[Pretoria]], South Africa cleared the way for seized Zimbabwean government assets in [[Cape Town]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swapoparty.org/afri_forum_attaches_zimbabwe_property_in_cape_town.html AFRI-FORUM attaches Zimbabwe Property in Cape Town] SWAPO&lt;/ref&gt; to be sold by auction to compensate 3 Zimbabwean farmers, including the late Mike Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesslive.co.za/incoming/2011/06/07/farmers-win-battle-to-sell-zimbabwe-state-assets Farmers win battle to sell Zimbabwe state assets] Business Live, published 2011-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iol-20110606&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/business/business-news/farmers-win-battle-to-sell-zim-assets-1.1079468 Farmers win battle to sell Zim assets – Business News] IOL Business, published 2011-06-06&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought to be the first ruling in international legal history that a country's assets should be sold to provide compensation for human rights violations.&lt;ref name=iol-20110606 /&gt; The Zimbabwean government appealed the High Court's decision, but both the Supreme Court (in September 2012)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZASCA/2012/122.html Government of the Republic of Zimbabwe v Fick and Others] (657/11) [2012] ZASCA 122 (Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa, 20 September 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Constitutional Court of South Africa (in June 2013)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/Archimages/21059.PDF Government of the Republic of Zimbabwe v Fick and Others], CCT101/12 (Constitutional Court of South Africa, 27 June 2013) &lt;/ref&gt; dismissed the appeal. 

'''SADC Tribunal suspended''' &lt;br /&gt;
On 20 May 2011, an Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government of SADC, held in Namibia, decided not to reappoint or replace SADC Tribunal members, effectively suspending the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/08/11/sadc-qa-tribunal SADC: Q&amp;A on The Tribunal – Regional Court’s Future Hangs in the Balance] [[Human Rights Watch]], published 2011-08-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimbabwedemocracynow.com/2011/05/26/sadc-tribunal-rights-watch-statement/ SADC Tribunal Rights Watch – Statement] zimbabwedemocracynow.com, published 2011-05-26&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4314">'''Molecular cellular cognition''' ('''MCC''') is a branch of  [[neuroscience]] that involves the study of cognitive processes with approaches that integrate molecular, cellular and behavioral mechanisms. Key goals of MCC studies include the derivation of molecular and cellular explanations of cognitive processes, as well as finding mechanisms and treatments for [[cognitive disorder]]s.

Although closely connected with [[behavioral genetics]], MCC emphasizes the integration of molecular and cellular explanations of behavior, instead of focusing on the connections between genes and behavior.

Unlike [[cognitive neuroscience]], which historically has focused on the connection between [[human brain]] systems and behavior, the field of MCC has used model organisms, such as mice, to study how molecular (i.e. receptor, [[kinase]] activation, [[phosphatase]] regulation), intra-cellular (i.e. [[Dendrite|dendritic]] processes), and inter-cellular processes (i.e. [[synaptic plasticity]]; network representations such as place fields) modulate cognitive function.

Methods employed in MCC include (but are not limited to) [[transgenic organism]]s (i.e. mice), [[viral vector]]s, [[pharmacology]], ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' [[electrophysiology]], [[optogenetics]], ''in vivo'' imaging, and behavioral analysis. Modeling is becoming an essential component of the field because of the complexity of the multilevel data generated.

==Scientific roots==
The field of MCC has its roots in the pioneering pharmacological studies of the role of [[NMDA receptor]] in [[long-term potentiation]] and [[spatial learning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris RG, Anderson E, Lynch GS, Baudry M |title=Selective impairment of learning and blockade of long-term potentiation by an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, AP5 |journal=Nature |volume=319 |issue=6056 |pages=774–6 |year=1986 |pmid=2869411 |doi=10.1038/319774a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v319/n6056/abs/319774a0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in studies that used [[Knockout mouse|knockout mice]] to look at the role of the [[Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase|alpha calcium calmodulin kinase II]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Silva AJ, Paylor R, Wehner JM, Tonegawa S |title=Impaired spatial learning in alpha-calcium-calmodulin kinase II mutant mice |journal=Science |volume=257 |issue=5067 |pages=206–11 |year=1992 |pmid=1321493 |doi= 10.1126/science.1321493|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Silva AJ, Stevens CF, Tonegawa S, Wang Y |title=Deficient hippocampal long-term potentiation in alpha-calcium-calmodulin kinase II mutant mice |journal=Science |volume=257 |issue=5067 |pages=201–6 |year=1992 |pmid=1378648 |doi= 10.1126/science.1378648|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/257/5067/201}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[FYN]] kinase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grant SG, O'Dell TJ, Karl KA, Stein PL, Soriano P, Kandel ER |title=Impaired long-term potentiation, spatial learning, and hippocampal development in fyn mutant mice |journal=Science |volume=258 |issue=5090 |pages=1903–10 |year=1992 |pmid=1361685 |doi= 10.1126/science.1361685|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/258/5090/1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] long-term potentiation and spatial learning. The field has since expanded to include a large array of molecules including [[CREB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Silva AJ |title=Molecular and cellular cognitive studies of the role of synaptic plasticity in memory |journal=J. Neurobiol. |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=224–37 |year=2003 |pmid=12486706 |doi=10.1002/neu.10169 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/101526010/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation of the field==
MCC became an organized field with the formation of the [[Molecular Cellular Cognition Society]], an organization with no membership fees and meetings that emphasize the participation of junior scientists. Its first meeting took place in Orlando, Florida on November first, 2002. {{As of|2012}}, the society had organized numerous meetings in North America, Europe, and Asia, and included more than 4000 members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8628">The '''Nakdi Report''', also known as the '''Nakdi Document''' ({{lang-he|מסמך נקדי}}, ''{{lang|he-Latn|Mismach Nakdi}}'' )  or as the '''Nakdi guidelines''' is the document that provides ethical guidelines for use in Israel's broadcasting industry. Published as the '''''Guidelines for Coverage of News and Current Affairs''''' in 1995, the doctrine was first introduced in 1972 by the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]. It is named for its original author, [[Nakdimon Rogel]].&lt;ref name=jp&gt;{{cite news|first=Greer Fay|last=Cashman |title=Veteran journalist and broadcaster Nakdimon Rogel dies |url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=248645&amp;R=R101|work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |publisher= |date=2011-12-08 |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterned after the [[BBC]]’s Editorial Guidelines (previously, the Producer Guidelines), the Document currently consists of 161 clauses and contains a comprehensive code of ethics and practice for journalists working within the IBA. It is also applied to journalists in private broadcasting, though it is not legally binding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Second Authority for Television and Radio]] uses a stripped-down, less detailed version of the code of conduct, which does indeed have the force of law.&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was drawn up in 1972, the document has been revised four times - in 1979, 1985, 1995 and 1998 - and expanded to four times its original size.&lt;ref name=Limor2002&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairness and legal challenges==
It is one of the few national ethics codes to retain a version of the [[Fairness Doctrine]]. This is in addition to notions of impartiality drawn from similar European codes, which require the Authority itself to refrain from broadcasting editorials.&lt;ref&gt;According to Amit M. Schejter, the crucial clause is clause 22: "Beyond the word of the law the Authority has no voice, policy or point of view of its own. The Authority does not broadcast 'editorials'. The role of the Authority and its employees is to let different voices speak for themselves."&lt;/ref&gt; Fairness, however, goes beyond mere impartiality: in order to "ensure the public’s right to receive full and reliable information alongside balanced and
varied opinions", journalists are required to "solicit opposing opinion, fairly notify the public if comment was refused, and avoid becoming 'tools of response' for 'professional reaction teams.'"&lt;ref&gt;Rogel, Nakdimon and Schejer, Amit. ''The Nakdi Document: Guidelines for Covering News and Current Affairs'', Jerusalem: Israel Broadcasting Authority, 1998; Clauses 30-31.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements to ensure varied opinion - repeated elsewhere in the document&lt;ref&gt;Rogel, Nakdimon and Schejer, Amit. ''The Nakdi Document: Guidelines for Covering News and Current Affairs'', Jerusalem: Israel Broadcasting Authority, 1998; Clause 24.&lt;/ref&gt; as an enjoinder "that the pool of commentators must be varied", has caused several notable lawsuits to be filed against the IBA. Three in the 1980s were particularly notable: the first was against the landmark 1981 television miniseries ''The Pillar of Fire''. Brought by a group of Israelis of [[Sephardic]] descent who felt that the dramatised history of [[Zionism]] unfairly minimised their communities' contribution to the movement, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] indicated that in this case fairness was "irrelevant"; broadcast could not be censored, but "another aspect of the issue should be presented".&lt;ref name=Schejter1999&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, a decision by the IBA to ban interviews with any supporters of the [[Palestinian Liberation Organisation]] in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|West Bank and Gaza]] was struck down; this case was the making of the now-legendary [[civil rights]] lawyer Amnon Zichroni. And in 1984, Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]] submitted that a similar ban on broadcasting his political statements be struck down. In a much-studied ruling that recognised racist speech was also [[free speech|protected speech]], the [[Supreme Court of Israel|High Court of Justice]] attempted to curtail the ''Zichroni vs IBA'' somewhat: [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]] was permitted a "right of reply" if its positions were misrepresented, but it could not demand that its platform be broadcast, and nor could it demand the right of reply to criticism.&lt;ref name=Schejter1999/&gt;

==Recent concerns==
More recently, the guidelines have faced a sustained barrage of criticism. After the 1996 revision appeared, a study by Yitzhak Roeh, a media studies academic at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|HUJI]] called it an "anachronism" and "irrelevant"&lt;ref&gt;Roeh, Yitzhak. "The Nakdi Document: Guidelines for Covering News and Current Affairs: A Review'', [[Ha'aretz]], 28 July 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, right-wing groups have frequently used the Nakdi Document as a basis for documentation of what they see as [[media bias]]; the two most high-profile incidents have been litigation surrounding the broadcast of [[Avishai Raviv]]'s "swearing-in ceremony" with [[Eyal]] at [[Baruch Goldstein]]'s grave, and the campaign to get rid of [[Gabi Gazit]], whom they saw as serially breaking "the policies of public radio".&lt;ref&gt;Cashman, Greer. "[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1178431585287&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull The Gift of the Gab, sure, but no more Gabi]", [[Jerusalem Post]], 7 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although at least one study has concluded that rather than being responses to political stimuli, the various revisions of the Document have resulted in a "crystallization and implementation of normative ethical guidelines for Israeli public broadcasting",&lt;ref name=Limor2002/&gt; criticism that the Document contains at least some inherent bias continues to be leveled. Recently, concern that the language expected of the Israeli media was not sufficiently neutral included the complaint that the phrase "[[East Jerusalem]]" were prohibited by the guidelines.&lt;ref name="titleLRB � Yonatan Mendel: Diary"&gt;{{cite web

There have also been concerns that the Document is not detailed enough; following [[Ariel Sharon]]'s incapacitation, its ability to provide guidance balance between the private matter of his health and the public's right to know was found wanting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3659">'''Narcissistic neurosis''' is a term introduced by [[Sigmund Freud]] to distinguish the class of [[neurosis|neuroses]] characterised by their lack of [[object relations theory|object relations]] and their fixation upon the early stage of libidinal [[narcissism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 471-2&lt;/ref&gt; The term is less current in contemporary psychoanalysis,&lt;ref&gt;J. Laplanche/J-B Pontalis, ''The Language of Psychoanalysis'' (2012) p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; but still a focus for analytic controversy.&lt;ref&gt;J-M Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (2005) p. 132-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud considered such neurosis as impervious to psychoanalytic treatment, as opposed to the [[transference neurosis]] where an emotional connection to the analyst was by contrast possible.&lt;ref&gt;''Introductory Lectures'' p. 473 and p. 499&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud's changing ideas==
Freud originally applied the term "narcissistic neurosis" to a range of disorders, including perversion, depression, and [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Quinodoz, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, however, he came to single out "illnesses which are based on a conflict between the ego and the [[super-ego]]... we would set aside the name of 'narcissistic psycho-neuroses' for disorders of that kind"&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;—[[melancholia]] being the outstanding example.

About the same time, in the wake of the work of [[Karl Abraham]], he began to modify to a degree his view on the inaccessibility of narcissistic neurosis to analytic treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; However his late lectures from the thirties confirmed his opinion of the unsuitability of narcissistic and psychotic conditions for treatment "to a greater or less extent";&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; as did his posthumous 'Outline of Psychoanalysis'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==
From the twenties onwards, Freud's views of the inaccessibility of the narcissistic neuroses to analytic influence had been challenged, first by [[Melanie Klein]],&lt;ref&gt;Quinodoz, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; and then by object relations theorists more broadly.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (1993) p. xi-ii&lt;/ref&gt;

While classical analysts like [[Robert Waelder]] would maintain Freud's delimiting standpoint into the sixties, eventually even within [[ego psychology]] challenges to the 'off-limits' view of what were increasingly seen as [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline disorders]] emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (1988) p. 129-32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Relational psychoanalysis]], like [[Heinz Kohut]], would also take a more positive approach to narcissistic neurosis, emphasising the need for a partial or initial participation in the narcissistic illusions.&lt;ref&gt;G. Mascialino, ''A Critical Appraisal of Relational Approaches to Psychoanalysis'' (2008) p. 56-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In retrospect, Freud's caution may be seen as a result of his unwillingeness to work with the [[negative transference]], unlike the post-Kleinians.&lt;ref&gt;Quinodoz, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 2010-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] system that generates negative pressure to allow air to flow into the isolation room but not escape from the room, as air will naturally flow from areas with higher pressure to areas with lower pressure, thereby preventing contaminated air from escaping the room. This technique is used to isolate patients with airborne [[contagious disease]]s such as [[tuberculosis]],  measles, or [[chickenpox]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airmontinc.com/negative-pressure.php Negative Pressure Isolation Rooms &amp; Tuberculosis (TB) Isolation Rooms], AirMont Inc.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Negative room.png|thumb|Schematic of a network of rooms where air (shown in blue) flows in one direction from the corridor into the negative pressure room (green). Exhaust air is safely removed from the area through a ventilation system.]]
[[vacuum|Negative pressure]] is generated and maintained by a ventilation system that removes more exhaust air from the room than air is allowed into the room. Air is allowed into the room through a gap under the door (typically about one half-inch high). Except for this gap, the room should be as airtight as possible, allowing no air in through cracks and gaps, such as those around windows, light fixtures and electrical outlets. Leakage from these sources can compromise or eliminate room negative pressure.&lt;ref name="camil"/&gt;

==Smoke test==
A [[smoke testing (mechanical)#Infectious disease control|smoke test]] can help determine whether a room is under negative pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc.state.mn.us/DocPolicy2/Document/500.522.htm Title: Negative Pressure Isolation Rooms], Minnesota Department of Corrections, Issue date 2007-07-03. Retrieved 2010-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  A tube containing smoke is held near the bottom of the negative pressure room door, about 2 inches in front of the door. The smoke tube is held parallel to the door, and a small amount of smoke is then generated by gently squeezing the bulb. Care is taken to release the smoke from the tube slowly to ensure the velocity of the smoke from the tube does not overpower the air velocity. If the room is at negative pressure, the smoke will travel under the door and into the room. If the room is not a negative pressure, the smoke will be blown outward or will stay stationary.

'''Occupy Central with Love and Peace''' (OCLP; 讓愛與和平佔領中環 or 和平佔中) was a single-purpose Hong Kong [[civil disobedience]] campaign convened by Reverend [[Chu Yiu-ming]], Dr [[Benny Tai]] Yiu-ting, and [[Chan Kin-man]] on 27 March 2013.  Its aim was to pressure the PRC Government into reforming the systems for election of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Chief Executive]] and [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] so as to satisfy "international standards in relation to universal suffrage" as promised in the 1984 [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] and [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45|Article 45]] of the 1997 [[Hong Kong Basic Law]].  Its manifesto called for occupation of the region's central business district if such reforms were not made.  Upstaged by the [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]] (HKFS) and [[Scholarism]] in September 2014, its leaders joined in the [[2014 Hong Kong protests|Occupy Central protests]].&lt;ref name="Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oclp.hk/index.php?route=occupy/eng_detail&amp;eng_id=9|title=OCLP Manifesto|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/occupy-central-hong-kong-democracy-campaign|title=Occupy Central gives downtown Hong Kong a taste of disobedience|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= 6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

{{main|Democratic development in Hong Kong}}
The implementation of universal suffrage having been established as a matter of Hong Kong's constitutional law in 1997, pressure began [[Democratic development in Hong Kong#Post-1997|steadily building]] from democrats to see its implementation.  As the years went by, the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong government]] and Beijing were seen to be dragging their feet and failing to comply with [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45]], which sets out the requirements for election of the Chief Executive:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html|title=Hong Kong Basic Law, Chapter IV : Political Structure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|chief executive]] of the [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]] shall be selected by election or through consultations held locally and be appointed by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Central People's Government]].&lt;ref name="HKbasicalaw"&gt;HK basic law web pdf. "[http://www.info.gov.hk/basic_law/fulltext/Basic_Law.pdf HK basic law]." ''The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative region of the People's Republic of China.'' Retrieved 8 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|The method for selecting the chief executive shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. The ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by [[universal suffrage]] upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with [[democracy|democratic procedures]].&lt;ref name="HKbasicalaw" /&gt;}}

In December 2007, the National People's Congress Law Committee officially ruled on the issue of universal suffrage in Hong Kong:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/2211/longtitle.html|title=Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Issues Relating to the Methods For Selecting The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region And For Forming The Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the Year 2012 And on Issues Relating To Universal Suffrage (Adopted by the Standing Committee of the Tenth National People's Congress at Its Thirty-First Session on 29 December 2007)|work=Hong Kong Legal Information Institute}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|that the election of the fifth chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the year 2017 may be implemented by the method of universal suffrage; that after the chief executive is selected by universal suffrage, the election of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may be implemented by the method of electing all the members by universal suffrage...}}

The ''[[Asia Times]]'' wrote in 2008 that both proposals for the Legislative Council (LegCo) and for the chief executive were "hedged in with so many ifs and buts that there is no guarantee of Hong Kong getting anything at all... "&lt;ref name="Atimes1"&gt;"{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JA11Ad01.html|title=Hong Kong on the march – again|newspaper=[[Asia Times Online]] |date= 11 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After another six years of government inaction, on 16 January 2013, Benny Tai, then an associate professor of law at the University of Hong Kong, published an article in the ''[[Hong Kong Economic Journal]]'' in which he proposed an act of [[civil disobedience]] be carried out in Central, the business and financial centre of Hong Kong if the government failed to announce reforms introducing genuine universal suffrage. He set no specific timetable for such action.&lt;ref name="16/1/13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkej.com/template/dailynews/jsp/detail.jsp?dnews_id=3609&amp;cat_id=6&amp;title_id=571297&amp;txtSearch=%E6%88%B4%E8%80%80%E5%BB%B7|work=[[Hong Kong Economic Journal]]|title=公民抗命的最大殺傷力武器|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting increased polarisation, disaffection and frustration with government inaction and Beijing intransigence, on 21 March 2013, all 27 democratically inclined lawmakers of the Legislative Council joined in establishing the [[Alliance for True Democracy]], adopting a more determined and confrontational stance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atd.hk/en/?page_id=10|title=Alliance for True Democracy; Manifesto|website=Alliance for True Democracy|access-date=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; than its recently failed and disbanded compromise-leaning predecessor, the [[Alliance for Universal Suffrage]].

On 24 March 2013, [[Qiao Xiaoyang]], then chairman of the Law Committee under the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) startled Hongkongers by announcing that Chief Executive candidates must be persons who love the country and love Hong Kong, and who do not insist on confronting the central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/03/26/hong-kongs-future-leader-must-love-china/|title=Hong Kong's Future Leader Must 'Love China'|date=26 March 2013|last=Chen|first=Te-ping|access-date=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The statement was taken as setting out new, vague pre-conditions for candidacy as a means of screening out candidates not sympathetic to Beijing's goals in Hong Kong, denying the promise of genuine democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Ming Pao|date=26 March 2017|title=Political Screening Unacceptable in Chief Executive Election|url=http://english.mingpao.com/cfm/database3b.cfm?File=20130326/critic/ema1.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CLee"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/1199015/opposition-camp-members-cant-run-chief-executive-says-npc-official|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|last1=Lee|first1=Colleen|last2=But|first2=Joshua|title=Opponents of Beijing ineligible to be CE: top Chinese official|date=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OCLP was convened three days later.

On 16 January 2013, an article by Benny Tai Yiu-ting was published in the ''[[Hong Kong Economic Journal]]'', entitled 公民抗命的最大殺傷力武器 (''Civil Disobedience's Deadliest Weapon'').  Tai postulated a seven-step progression: 10,000 participants signing a declaration (taking a vow and pledge of willingness to occupy the streets), live TV broadcast of discussions, electronic voting on methods for universal suffrage, a referendum on the preferred formula, resignation of Super-Seat Legislative Council member (then former [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] Chairman [[Albert Ho|Albert Ho Chun-yan]]) to be filled in a by-election to be seen as a referendum on the plan, civil disobedience, and, finally, Occupy Central in July 2014.&lt;ref name="16/1/13"/&gt;  Tai repeated his plan at a forum held on 24 February 2013, emphasising the importance of the non-violence pledge.&lt;ref name="25/2/13"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hot talk swirls on 'occupy Central' idea|last=Luk|first=Eddie|newspaper=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|date=25 February 2013|accessdate=27 March 2013|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=131351&amp;sid=39060291&amp;con_type=1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106211405/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=131351&amp;sid=39060291&amp;con_type=1|archivedate=6 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview together with Ho on 6 March 2013, Tai spoke at length about his referendum and protest strategies to bring about universal suffrage in Hong Kong and stated:  "This is a people's movement; frankly speaking, the central government will have to accept [the referendum result] or reject it; if they reject it, we will block the streets."&lt;ref name=Inmedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inmediahk.net/albert-ho-chun-yan-promised-resign-pave-way-occupy-central-movement|title=Albert Ho Chun-Yan Promised to Resign to pave way for the Occupy Central Movement|last=Chan|first=Melody|date=12 March 2013|access-date=9 October 2017|website=Inmedia Hong Kong}}, Chinese original at https://web.archive.org/web/20130310042455/http://www.inmediahk.net/hotai&lt;/ref&gt;

OCLP was launched at a press conference hosted by its three founders, Reverend [[Chu Yiu-ming]], Dr Benny Tai Yiu-ting, and Dr [[Chan Kin-man]], on 27 March 2013 at which they presented its manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/occupy-hong-kong-for-universal-suffrage/|title='Occupy' Hong Kong, for Universal Suffrage|last=Tatlow|first=Didi Kirsten|date=4 April 2013|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
[[File:Genuine Universal Suffrage.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Hong Kong protest banner]]

OCLP's manifesto stated that it would campaign for universal suffrage through dialogue, [[deliberative democracy|deliberation]], civil referendum and civil disobedience (Occupy Central);&lt;ref name="Manifesto" /&gt; it also demanded that any [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform consultation|government proposal]] should satisfy international standards in relation to universal suffrage, i.e. equal number of votes, equal weight for each vote and no unreasonable restrictions on the right to stand for election, and that the final proposal for electoral reform be decided by means of a genuine democratic process.  The founders emphasised their objective of non-violent civil disobedience&lt;ref name="Manifesto"/&gt; but, as their campaign had no leaders nor membership, what acts members of the public adopted was a matter for them to decide as individuals.&lt;ref name=risky&gt;{{cite news|title=Occupy Central is action based on risky thinking|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?art_id=146299&amp;con_type=3|publisher=The Standard|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912212732/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?art_id=146299&amp;con_type=3|archivedate=12 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Democratic Party support==
On 5 February 2014, the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] staged a public oath-taking, at [[Statue Square]] , with members swearing to join in Occupy Central irrespective of the risk of arrest and imprisonment.  Members of [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]], disparaging of the Democratic Party's failure to demand direct civil nomination of Chief Executive candidates in its platform, disrupted the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=People Power radicals disrupt Democratic Party's Occupy Central event|last=Lau|first=Stewart|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1421488/democratic-party-protest-mob-occupy-central-albert-ho|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deliberations on reform==
{{See also|2014 Hong Kong electoral reform}}
Deliberation days were organised by OCLP on 9 June 2013, 9 March 2014, and 6 May 2014, at which attendees were invited to exchange views on strategies to be adopted to achieve democratic reform.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

On the third deliberation day, the Occupy Central participants voted on electoral reform proposals put forward by various pro-democracy groups, with the objective of determining which should be put to a plebiscite.  Five proposals were put to the attendees and the three most popular selected.  The proposal by student groups [[Scholarism]] and [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]] which allowed for public nomination, received 1,124 votes – 45 percent of the vote. People Power's proposal came in second with 685 votes, while the three-track proposal by the [[Alliance for True Democracy]] consisting of 27 pan-democracy lawmakers got 445 votes.  The civil recommendation method proposed by 18 academics got 74 votes and [[Hong Kong 2020]]'s proposal came in last with 43 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=145115&amp;sid=42211090&amp;con_type=1|title=Students' reform proposals get the thumbs-up|first=Kelly|last=Ip|date=7 May 2014|newspaper=The Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A total of 2,508 votes were cast in the poll.

All three selected proposals included the concept of civil nomination, which the mainland authorities had already flatly rejected as not compliant with the Basic Law.  The three chosen proposals were thus considered to be the more radical, leaving moderate [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democrats]] in the cold, laying the ground for friction and division among democrats.&lt;ref name=20140515hks&gt;Luk, Eddie (15 May 2014).

OCLP commissioned the University of Hong Kong Public Opinion Programme (HKUPOP) to run a poll on three proposals – all of which involved allowing citizens to directly nominate candidates – for presentation to the Beijing government. It ran from 20 to 29 June 2014.&lt;ref name="unofficial referendum Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong's unofficial pro-democracy referendum irks Beijing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/25/hong-kong-unofficial-pro-democracy-referendum-beijing|first=Jonathan|last=Kaiman|date=25 June 2014|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 792,808 people, equivalent to over one fifth of the registered electorate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.gov.hk/legco2016/eng/turnout.html?1507448322993|title=2016 Legislative Council Election|publisher=Electoral Affairs Commission, Hong Kong Government|access-date=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; took part in the poll by either voting online or going to designated polling stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-28076566|publisher=BBC|title=Hong Kong democracy 'referendum' draws nearly 800,000|date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal tabled by the Alliance for True Democracy, a group comprising 26 of the 27 pan-democratic lawmakers, won the unofficial referendum by securing 331,427 votes, or 42.1 per cent of the 787,767 valid ballots. A joint blueprint put forward by Scholarism and the Hong Kong Federation of Students came second with 302,567 votes (38.4 per cent), followed by the People Power proposal, which garnered 81,588 votes (10.4 per cent).&lt;ref name=20140630hks&gt;{{cite web|last=Luk|first=Eddie|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=146908&amp;sid=42538382&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20140630&amp;fc=1|title=Alliance proposal wins the day|newspaper=The Standard|date=30 June 2014|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714221707/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=146908&amp;sid=42538382&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20140630&amp;fc=1|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ATD wins"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1543231/nearly-800000-hongkongers-vote-occupy-central-poll?page=all|title=Alliance for True Democracy proposal wins Occupy Central poll as nearly 800,000 Hongkongers vote|date=29 June 2014|newspaper=South China Morning Post|first1=Tony|last1=Cheung|first2=Jeffie|last2=Lam|first3=Joyce|last3=Ng|first4=Gary|last4=Cheung}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three called for the public to be allowed to nominate candidates for the 2017 Chief Executive election, an idea repeatedly dismissed by Beijing as inconsistent with the Basic Law.  The Alliance's provided for nomination by the election committee and by political parties, as well. The plan was not specific on method of formation of the nominating committee, only stating that it should be "as democratic as it can be". The two other proposals were for nomination by the public and nominating committee only.&lt;ref name="ATD wins"/&gt; 691,972 voters (87.8 per cent) agreed that the Legislative Council should veto any reform proposal put forward by the government if it failed to meet international standards, compared with 7.5 per cent who disagreed.&lt;ref name="ATD wins"/&gt;

The unofficial referendum infuriated Beijing.  Mainland officials and newspapers called it "illegal" while many condemned Occupy Central, claiming it was operating at the behest of foreign "anti-China forces" and would damage Hong Kong's standing as a financial capital.&lt;ref name="unofficial referendum Guardian"/&gt; [[Zhang Junsheng]], a former deputy director of Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong, denounced the poll as "meaningless". The state-run ''[[Global Times]]'' mocked the referendum as an "illegal farce" and a "joke". The region's chief executive, Leung Chun-Ying, offered this rebuke: "Nobody should place Hong Kong people in confrontation with mainland Chinese citizens."  Mainland censors meanwhile scrubbed social media sites clean of references to Occupy Central.&lt;ref name="unofficial referendum Guardian"/&gt; The poll also prompted a flurry of vitriolic editorials, preparatory police exercises and sophisticated cyber-attacks where strategies evolved over time.  According to [[CloudFlare]], a firm that helped defend against a "unique and sophisticated" attack,&lt;ref name="unofficial referendum Guardian"/&gt; [[CloudFlare]] the volume of traffic was an unprecedented 500Gbit/s and involved at least five [[botnet]]s. OCLP's servers were bombarded with in excess of 250 million DNS requests per second, equivalent to the average volume of legitimate DNS requests for the entire Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/11/20/the-largest-cyber-attack-in-history-has-been-hitting-hong-kong-sites/|title=The Largest Cyber Attack In History Has Been Hitting Hong Kong Sites|date=20 November 2014|website=Forbes|last=Olson|first=Parmy|publisher=|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the referendum, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] issued a [[The Practice of the 'One Country, Two Systems' Policy in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|white paper]] claiming "comprehensive jurisdiction" over the territory.&lt;ref&gt;Yung, Chester (10 June 2014). [https://online.wsj.com/articles/china-reminds-hong-kong-of-its-control-1402411342 "China Reminds Hong Kong of Its Control"]. ''The Wall Street Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; "The high degree of autonomy of the HKSAR [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] is not full autonomy, nor a decentralised power," it said. "It is the power to run local affairs as authorised by the central leadership." Michael DeGolyer, director of the transition project at [[Hong Kong Baptist University]], said: "It's very clear from surveys that the vast majority of the people voting in this referendum are doing it as a reaction to this white paper – particularly because they see it as threatening the rule of law ... That's not negotiating on the one country two systems principle, that's demolishing it."&lt;ref name="unofficial referendum Guardian"/&gt;

==Criminal liability for OCLP protesters==

The OCLP has pointed out the participants in Occupy Central could be guilty of "obstructing, inconveniencing or endangering a person or vehicle in a public place" under the Summary Offenses Ordinance. However, under the Public Order Ordinance, Occupy Central was considered as [[unlawful assembly]], i.e., "when three or more people assemble... to cause any person reasonably to fear that the persons so assembled will commit a breach of the peace or will by such conduct provoke other persons to commit a breach of the peace, they are an unlawful assembly." The Hong Kong [[Secretary for Security]] [[Lai Tung-kwok]] stated that the government will "take robust action to uphold the rule of law and maintain safety and order."&lt;ref name=risky/&gt;

OCLP also published a "manual of disobedience" to inform protesters what to do in the event of being detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oclp.hk/index.php?route=occupy/eng_detail&amp;eng_id=28|title=OCLP - Manual of Disobedience |website=Occupy Central with Love and Peace|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions to formation and objective==

===SAR government===

On 21 March 2013, in an apparent response to reports of Tai's statements early that month and the formation that day of the [[Alliance for True Democracy]], [[Commissioner of Police (Hong Kong)|Commissioner of Police]] [[Andy Tsang Wai-hung]] said that any attempt to block major thoroughfares in Central would not be tolerated and warned people to think twice about joining the Occupy Central protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Occupy Central' plan draws warnings|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1196531/occupy-central-plan-draws-warnings|newspaper=South China Morning Post|accessdate=22 March 2013|date=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, with pressure building in view of the original plan for July 2014 occupy action, [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Leung Chun-ying]] warned that the Occupy Central movement was bound to be neither peaceful nor legal and that actions will be taken to maintain law and order&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crackdown warning over 'illegal' Occupy move|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?art_id=134475&amp;con_type=1|first1=Kelly|last1=Ip|first2=Eddie|last2=Luk|date=10 June 2014|newspaper=The Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Secretary for Security Lai Tung-kwok warned that radical elements of Occupy Central may cause serious disturbances like the violent incident at the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] during the meeting for funding the northeast New Territories new town.  Lai reminded the participants to consider their own personal safety and legal liability.&lt;ref name=risky/&gt;

===PRC government===

====Officials' response====
On 24 March 2013, [[Wang Guangya]], director of the [[Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office]], when asked if he believed the Occupy Central plan would be beneficial to the city, said "I think Hong Kong compatriots don't want to see Hong Kong being messed up. Hong Kong needs development."&lt;ref name="25/3/13"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1199036/occupy-central-plan-gets-hong-kong-affairs-chiefs-thumbs-down|title=Occupy Central plan gets Hong Kong affairs chief's thumbs down|last1=Lee|first1=Colleen|last2=But|first2=Joshua|date=25 March 2013|accessdate=27 March 2013|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Qiao Xiaoyang, chairman of the [[National People's Congress]] Law Committee, was quoted as accusing the "opposition camp" of "fuelling" the Occupy Central plan. Qiao said the plan was only "partly truthful", "complex" and a "risk-everything" proposition.&lt;ref name="25/3/13"/&gt;

In October 2013 the Communist Party-controlled ''[[Global Times]]'' objected to Occupy organizers meeting with [[Democratic Progressive Party]] figures such as [[Shih Ming-teh]] in Taiwan, saying that the DPP, the main opposition party to Taiwan's governing [[KMT]], was "pro-independence."  In a piece titled "HK opposition at risk of becoming [[enemy of the State]]," Occupy organizers were warned that "collaborating with the pro-independence forces in Taiwan will put Hong Kong's future at the risk of violence," and advised that "if they collaborated... massive chaos might be created, which will compel the central government to impose tough measures to maintain Hong Kong's stability."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/820178.shtml HK opposition at risk of becoming enemy of the State] ''[[Global Times]]'' 24 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later the paper said that OCLP was the "extreme opposition" and that Occupy Central was a "potentially violent concept".  It asked rhetorically, "Why are Benny Tai Yiu-ting, who initiated the Occupy Central campaign and his supporters so bold as to challenge the central government with a bloody proposal over the issue of chief executive election procedures?", answering that the "ulterior motive" lay in "interference from foreign forces".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/822450.shtml Violent democracy threatens HK prospects] ''[[Global Times]]'' 4 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Global Times'' continued its critical commentary the day after OCLP's announcement of the commencement of Occupy Central, describing the occupation as an "illicit campaign [which would] jeopardise the global image of Hong Kong [and] erode the authority of the rule of law". The demonstrators were described as "radical opposition forces", a small minority of extremists incapable of mobilising the "entire populace" to revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Global Times|date=29 September 2014|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/884080.shtml|title=Street movement ruins Hong Kong image|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Censorship====
The Occupy Central campaign was censored from [[Media of China|mainland China news media]] and replaced by cheerful reports of government supporters gathering near the Tamar government headquarters to endorse the central government's plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/china-censors-images-hong-kong-protests|title=China censors images of Hong Kong protests in TV broadcasts to mainland|date=29 September 2014|access-date=9 October 2017|last=Kaiman|first=Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Users of the mainland-controlled messaging application [[WeChat]] observed that Occupy Central content sent by them was filtered out of their messages as viewed by their addressees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1607452/wechat-allegedly-censoring-photos-hong-kong-protests|title=WeChat allegedly censoring photos from Hong Kong protests|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=2 October 2014|last=Luo|first=Chris|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social media such as [[Tencent Weibo|Weibo]] came under never-before-seen levels of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Record censorship of China's social media as references to Hong Kong protests blocked|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1603869/record-censorship-chinas-social-media-references-hong-kong|last=Boehler|first=Patrick|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=29 September 2014|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually accessible [[Instagram]] was blocked entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/aa0e81a4-479e-11e4-ac9f-00144feab7de|newspaper=Financial Times|title=HK protests: the censored view from Beijing|last=Mitchell|first=Tom|date=29 September 2014|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-democracy camp===
In February 2013, [[Civic Party]] lawmaker [[Kwok Ka-ki]] said he saw the ideas as "the last resort" to pressure Beijing and the SAR administration to introduce universal suffrage. "If Beijing breaks its promise of universal suffrage," he added, "we will have no option but to launch such a civil disobedience movement."&lt;ref name="25/2/13" /&gt;

[[Albert Ho Chun-yan]] of the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] undertook to resign his legislator post to enforce a de facto referendum on universal suffrage just as the pan-democrats had done by triggering the [[Hong Kong by-election, 2010|by-election in 2010]].&lt;ref name=Inmedia /&gt;

Not all democrats' reactions were supportive. [[Wong Yeung-tat]], of [[Civic Passion]], for example, was strongly opposed to the movement.&lt;ref name="shidai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.hk.msn.com/sunday/%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E6%99%82%E4%BB%A3%E7%9A%84%E7%B5%82%E7%B5%90|date=24 March 2013|accessdate=5 April 2013|title=一個時代的終結|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413185832/http://news.hk.msn.com/sunday/%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E6%99%82%E4%BB%A3%E7%9A%84%E7%B5%82%E7%B5%90|archivedate=13 April 2013|df=dmy-all}} in Chinese&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-Beijing camp===
[[Cheung Kwok-kwan]], vice-chairman of the pro-Beijing [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong]], questioned whether Hong Kong could "afford the negative impact of people staging a rally to occupy and even paralyze Central for a universal suffrage model". He noted that it was "a mainstream idea" in the SAR not to resort to radical means to fight for democracy.&lt;ref name="25/2/13"/&gt; [[Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai]], a [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] member, feared the occupation would adversely affect Hong Kong's image.&lt;ref name="27/3/13"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadailyapac.com/article/npc-deputies-blast-%E2%80%9Coccupy-central%E2%80%9D-threat-opposition|title=NPC deputies blast 'Occupy Central' threat by opposition|newspaper=China Daily|date=11 March 2013|accessdate=27 March 2013|first=Kahon|last=Chan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National People's Congress]] Deputy and Executive Councilor [[Fanny Law|Fanny Law Fan Chiu-fan]] urged the opposition camp to show respect for each other through a rational and pragmatic debate over the issue.

In mid-July 2014, after the civic referendum, the APD, under its spokesman [[Robert Chow]], initiated a petition against the occupation, with signatures to be gathered from 18 July to 17 August.&lt;ref name=20140721hks/&gt; There were criticisms that no identity checks were carried out and that there were no steps to prevent repeat signings.&lt;ref name=20140721hks/&gt; According to the ''Wall Street Journal'' and ''South China Morning Post'', employees of corporations such as the major utility [[The Hong Kong and China Gas Company|Towngas]] faced pressure to sign petition forms that were being circulated by their department heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=HKT|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/07/28/a-million-sign-hong-kong-petition-as-democracy-fight-ratchets-up/ |title=A Million Sign Hong Kong Petition as Democracy Fight Ratchets Up – China Real Time Report |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=28 July 2014 |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1555515/towngas-backs-down-after-asking-staff-sign-anti-occupy-central "Towngas Backs Down After Asking Staff Sign Anti Occupy Central"] ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The APD claimed in excess of a million signatures were obtained.&lt;ref name=20140818wsj/&gt; The organisers said they obtained signatures from many supporters including children, secondary school and university students, the elderly, office staff, celebrities and [[foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong|maids]].&lt;ref name=20140721hks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=147555&amp;sid=42656332&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20140721&amp;isSearch=1&amp;sear_year=2014 |title=Shocking turnout of anti-Occupy backers |work=The Standard |accessdate=19 August 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085030/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=147555&amp;sid=42656332&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20140721&amp;isSearch=1&amp;sear_year=2014 |archivedate=19 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Official endorsements were received from Chief Executive CY Leung and other top Hong Kong officials.&lt;ref name=20140818wsj&gt;Ngai, Edward (18 August 2014) [https://online.wsj.com/articles/hong-kongs-pro-beijing-groups-march-to-oppose-occupy-central-1408294278 "Hong Kong's Pro-Beijing Groups March to Oppose Occupy Central"].

===Business and professional groups===
A meeting held in October 2013 between members of the Occupy Central movement and [[Taiwanese independence]] activists was met with condemnation by eight major local business groups. A statement to that effect was signed by the [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]], the [[Chinese General Chamber of Commerce]], the [[Federation of Hong Kong Industries]], the [[Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong]] and the [[Real Estate Developers Association of Hong Kong]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International business mulling Occupy Central censure|date=16 May 2014|url=http://harbourtimes.com/openpublish/article/international-business-mulling-occupy-central-censure|newspaper=Harbour Times|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133444/http://harbourtimes.com/openpublish/article/international-business-mulling-occupy-central-censure|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Executives and brokers including tycoons [[Li Ka-shing]] and [[Peter Woo]], and also the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the Hong Kong Bahrain Business Association, the Canadian, Indian and Italian chambers of commerce in Hong Kong together published an advertisement on newspapers that said the demonstrations may "cripple commerce in the city's central business district".  The statement was directed at the "organisers of Occupy Central".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Business chambers condemn Occupy Central in newspaper ads|first=Cheung|last=Gary|date=11 June 2014|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1529895/business-chambers-condemn-occupy-central-newspaper-ads|newspaper=South China Morning Post|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June 2014, Hong Kong's [[Big Four (audit firms)|four biggest accounting firms]] issued a statement condemning the Occupy Central movement arguing that the blockade could have an "adverse and far-reaching impact" on the local legal system, social order and economic development. Employees of the firms who called themselves a "group of Big Four employees who love Hong Kong" took out an advertisement saying their employers' statement did not represent their stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Employees from 'Big Four' accounting firms disown anti-Occupy Central ad|first=Stuart|last=Lau|date=30 June 2014|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
Cardinal [[Joseph Zen]], the Roman Catholic leader in Hong Kong, gave his conditional support to the campaign, stating that it must have well-defined goals and deadlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=陳日君有條件支持「佔領中環」|url=http://news.sina.com.hk/news/20130316/-2-2919865/1.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=Ming Pao|date=16 March 2013|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329002854/http://news.sina.com.hk/news/20130316/-2-2919865/1.html|archivedate=29 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incumbent bishop Cardinal [[John Tong Hon]] expressed that he did not encourage followers to join the movement, suggesting that both parties should debate universal suffrage through dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=湯漢不鼓勵信眾「佔領中環」|url=http://www.singtao.com/breakingnews/20130323a132502.asp|newspaper=[[Sing Tao Daily]] |date=23 March 2013|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverend Ng Chung-man of the Protestant [[Evangelical Free Church of China]] publicly denounced the Occupy Central plan in his church's newsletter. Ng wrote that while "some Christians are advocating...occupying Central to force the governments to give in to their demands...civil disobedience is acceptable biblically only...when people's rights to religion and to live are under threat". He exhorted believers to pray for those in authority, in an act of  "active subordination" to "relatively just governments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church leaders divided over 'Occupy Central' plan|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1218649/church-leaders-divided-over-occupy-central-plan|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=20 April 2013|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 September 2014, after the [[2014 Hong Kong class boycott campaign|class boycott campaign]], students led by members of the [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]] (HKFS) and [[Scholarism]] occupied Civic Square, triggering a crowd to protest in support outside the [[Central Government Offices]] in Admiralty. On 28 September 2014, at 1.40am, Benny Tai announced the official start of the Occupy Central with Love and Peace civil disobedience campaign on the stage of the student protests. He proposed that the areas around the government headquarters be the occupation site in place of Central proper.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-29397738|publisher=BBC News|title=Thousands at Hong Kong protest as Occupy Central is launched|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday night, 28 September 2014, the scenes in Central and Admiralty became more dramatic, as the police employed tear gas, pepper spray, and batons in their attempts to disperse the protesters. The use of tear gas was a significant move in Hong Kong, as it had not been used in the SAR since 2005 and, on that occasion, in the highly exceptional situation of quelling violent Korean farmers bent on disrupting a [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2005|WTO conference]].&lt;ref name="SCMP20140929"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1603350/police-fire-tear-gas-and-baton-charge-thousands-occupy-central|title=Police fire tear gas and baton charge thousands of Occupy Central protesters|work=South China Morning Post|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excessive use of force by Hong Kong Police in dispersing Hongkongers antagonised and frustrated the general public and did not deter the protesters; rather, it gave impetus to thousands more to begin occupation of other major thoroughfares of Hong Kong, namely, at [[Mong Kok]] and [[Causeway Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/hong-kong-citizens-protests-police-withdraw "Hong Kong citizens urged to continue protests as police withdraw"], Tania Branigan&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday, the government withdrew the riot police, leaving the three regions occupied by protesters, and there were massive traffic disruptions as all traffic had to be diverted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=After night of tear gas, Hong Kong protesters dig in|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/29/world/asia/china-hong-kong-protests/index.html?hpt=hp_t1|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=CNN|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==OCLP bows out==
The scale and scope of the three main occupations was unprecedented, involving many pressure groups as well as many citizens not associated with any group at all.  What had been formulated by the OCLP organisers was now much bigger than OCLP and completely beyond their or any single group's control. Hence, the role of OCLP's volunteers was to provided support, for example, through its legal support team, for what had become a major, yet amorphous, movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1 December 2018|title=In full: The testimony of protest organiser Chan Kin-man at the trial of the Umbrella Movement 9|last=Kong|first=Tsung-gan|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/12/01/full-transcript-umbrella-movement-convener-chan-kin-mans-testimony-trial-occupy-9/|newspaper=Hong Kong Free Press|access-date=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the occupation ended its first month, Chan Kin-man and Benny Tai resumed their teaching duties at their respective universities and OCLP handed over the command of its medic, marshal and supplies teams to the student groups.&lt;ref name="Mingpao20141031"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mingpao20141028"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://specials.mingpao.com/cfm/News.cfm?News=84f43439c5680a1a9da4f62b294641921eaef2a9c96006da952c02adade02adad87404|title=陳健民戴耀廷將大學復教 事務隊「交棒」學生 陳：不是退場|work=Ming Pao|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 December 2014, the Occupy Central trio, along with 62 others including Democratic Party lawmaker [[Wu Chi-wai]] and Cardinal [[Joseph Zen]], then Bishop Emeritus of Hong Kong, turned themselves in to the police, admitting taking part in an unauthorised assembly. The police declined to arrest them and no charges were laid at the time.&lt;ref name="SCMP20141204"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police let Occupy organisers walk away without charge after they turn themselves in|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1654634/no-regrets-says-occupys-benny-tai-he-prepares-hand-himself-police|accessdate=6 December 2014|work=South China Morning Post|date=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the trio, they did so in order to bear legal responsibility and uphold the rule of law, as well as to affirm their principles of love and peace.  OCLP was disbanded by the founders upon surrendering to the police.&lt;ref name=20150120harbour/&gt;  They also urged occupiers to leave for their own safety, citing their fear that the government use the police to stamp its authority on them.&lt;ref name="OCLP20141202"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oclp.hk/index.php?route=occupy/eng_detail&amp;eng_id=61 | title=Occupy Central Trio's Letter to the Hong Kong People | publisher=Occupy Central with Love and Peace | date= 2 December 2014 | accessdate=6 December 2014 |author1=Tai, Benny Yiu-ting  |author2=Chan, Kin-man  |author3=Chu, Yiu-ming |lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCLP leaders planned to pursue their cause through community work and education.&lt;ref name="OCLP20141202"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4022">An '''option symbol''' is a code by which [[Option (finance)|options]] are identified on an options exchange or a [[futures exchange]].

==History==
Before 2010 the ticker (trading) symbols for US options typically looked like this: ''IBMAF''.
This consisted of a ''root symbol'' ('IBM') + ''month code'' ('A') + ''[[strike price]]'' code ('F'). The root symbol is the symbol of the stock on the stock exchange. After this comes the month code, A-L mean January–December [[call option|calls]], M-X mean January–December [[put option|puts]]. The strike price code is a letter corresponding with a certain strike price (which letter corresponds with which strike price depends on the stock).

On February 12, 2010 the five-character ticker format stopped being used in the US and Canada.

The new standard is now fully in place, as in the first few months after February 12 the LEAP roots and additional roots needed to handle large numbers of options for a given issuer were consolidated into a single root ticker for a given underlying symbol. [[Options Clearing Corporation]]'s (OCC) Options Symbology Initiative (OSI) mandated an industry-wide change to a new option symbol structure, resulting in option symbols 21 characters in length. March 2010 - May 2010 was the symbol consolidation period in which all outgoing option roots will be replaced with the underlying stock symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theocc.com/initiatives/symbology/overview.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111043514/http://www.theocc.com/initiatives/symbology/overview.jsp |archivedate=2010-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 18, 2013, [[CBOE]] Mini Options became available for trading on a select group of securities (AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, GLD, and SPY).  These options represent a deliverable of 10 shares of an underlying security, whereas standard equity options represent a deliverable of 100 shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cboe.com/micro/mini/default.aspx|title=Cboe Products - Index Options  Equity Options|website=Cboe.com|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CBOE appended a "7" to the end of the security symbol to represent the mini option contracts.

==The OCC Option Symbol==
The OCC option symbol consists of four parts:
# Root symbol of the underlying stock or [[Exchange-traded fund|ETF]], padded with spaces to 6 characters
# Expiration date, 6 digits in the format yymmdd
# Option type, either P or C, for put or call
# Strike price, as the price x 1000, front padded with 0s to 8 digits

Examples:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.interactivebrokers.com/download/ociguide.pdf|title=OCC Option Symbology Initiative (OCI) Implementation Guide|date=September 2012|website=Interactivebrokers.com|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;SPX   141122P00019500&lt;/pre&gt;This symbol represents a put on SPX, expiring on 11/22/2014, with a strike price of $19.50.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;LAMR  150117C00052500&lt;/pre&gt;This symbol represents a call on LAMR, expiring on 1/17/2015, with a strike price of $52.50.

===Mini Options===
Mini-options contracts trade under a different trading symbol than standard-sized options contracts. Mini-options carry the number "7" at the end of the security symbol.  For example, the Apple mini-options symbol is AAPL7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.cboe.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=745371|work=CBOE|publisher=CBOE|title=CBOE And C2 Plan To Launch Mini-Options On March 18 For AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, GLD And SPY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;AAPL7 131101C00470000&lt;/pre&gt;This symbol represents a mini call option (10 shares) on AAPL, with a strike price of $470, expiring on Nov 1, 2013&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;AAPL  131101C00470000&lt;/pre&gt;This symbol represents the standard call option (100 shares), with the same strike and expiration date.

'''Peace testimony''', or '''testimony against war''', is a shorthand description of the action generally taken by members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) for peace and against participation in war. Like other [[Quakers#Practical theology|Quaker testimonies]], it is not a "belief", but a description of committed actions, in this case to promote peace, and refrain from and actively oppose participation in war.  Quakers' original refusal to bear arms has been broadened to embrace protests and demonstrations in opposition to government policies of war and confrontations with others who bear arms, whatever the reason, in the support of [[peace]] and active [[nonviolence]].  Because of this core testimony, the Religious Society of Friends is considered one of the traditional [[peace churches]].

== General explanation ==
[[File:QuakersPennsylvanie.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Quakers in Pennsylvania meeting with Native Americans]]
[[Religious Society of Friends|Friends']] peace testimony is largely derived from beliefs arising from the teachings of [[Jesus]] to love one's enemies and Friends' belief in the [[inner light]].  Quakers believe that nonviolent confrontation of evil and peaceful reconciliation are always superior to violent measures.  Peace testimony does not mean that Quakers engage only in passive resignation; in fact, they often practice passionate activism.

The Peace Testimony is probably the best known testimony of Friends. The belief that violence is wrong has persisted to this day, and many [[conscientious objector]]s, advocates of [[non-violence]] and [[anti-war]] activists are Friends. Because of their peace testimony, Friends are considered as one of the historic [[peace church]]es. In 1947 Friends as a worldwide religious group were awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], which was accepted by the [[American Friends Service Committee]] and the then London Yearly Meeting's Friends Service Committee, now called Britain Yearly Meeting [[Quaker Peace and Social Witness|Peace &amp; Social Witness]] on behalf of all Friends. The Peace Testimony has not always been well received in the world; on many occasions Friends have been imprisoned for refusing to serve in military activities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Some Friends today regard the Peace Testimony in even a broader sense, [[tax resistance|refusing to pay the portion of the income tax]] that goes to fund the military. Yearly Meetings in the United States, Britain and other parts of the world endorse and support these Friends' actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Quaker Faith &amp; Practice | publisher = Britain Yearly Meeting | date = 1999 | pages = 1.02.31 | isbn = 0-85245-306-X | author = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quaker Council for European Affairs]] campaigns in the European Parliament for the right of conscientious objectors in Europe not to be made to pay for the military. Some do pay the money into peace charities and still get goods seized by bailiffs or money taken from their bank accounts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In America, others pay into an [[escrow]] account in the name of the [[Internal Revenue Service]], which the IRS can only access if they give an assurance that the money will only be used for peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyym.org/purchasequarter/peacetax.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Yearly meetings in the US run escrow accounts for conscientious objectors, both within and outside the Society.

Many Friends engage in various non-governmental organizations such as [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]] serving in some of the most violent areas of the world. Quaker author [[Howard Brinton]], for example, served in the American Friends Service Committee during World War I.

== Development of Quaker beliefs about peace ==
{{See also|Christian pacifism}}
[[George Fox]], perhaps the most influential early Quaker, made a declaration in 1651 that many see as the first declaration of Friends' beliefs on peace:
&lt;ref name=fox&gt;[http://www.quaker.org/minnfm/peace/fox_1651.htm Fox 1651]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1660 [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of King Charles II]] and a clamp-down on religious radical groups such as the [[Fifth Monarchists]], 
:I told [the Commonwealth Commissioners] I lived in the virtue of that life and power that took away the occasion of all wars and I knew from whence all wars did rise, from the lust, according to James's doctrine... I told them I was come into the covenant of peace which was before wars and strifes were. 

A number of letters and statements were written this year, as much to remove any suspicion that Friends might have been involved in violent political activity as a desire to make their position clear. Margaret Fell wrote a letter to King Charles II that was co-signed "in unity" by a number of prominent Friends, including Fox:

:We are a people that follow after those things that make for peace, love, and unity; it is our desire that others' feet may walk in the same, and do deny and bear our testimony against all strife, and wars, and contentions that come from the lusts that war in the members, that war against the soul, which we wait for and watch for in all people, and love and desire the good of all.&lt;ref name="full text"&gt;''A declaration from the harmless and innocent people of God, called Quakers'', London: 1660, as quoted in: Britain Yearly Meeting [Ed] ''[http://www.qhpress.org/quakerpages/qwhp/mf2king.htm Margaret Fell's Letter to the King on Persecution]'', 1660&lt;/ref&gt;

The most well-known statement of this belief &lt;ref name="fox 2"&gt;from [http://www.hallvworthington.com/gfjournal6b.html#peace George Fox's Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; was stated later that year in a declaration to King [[Charles II of England]] in 1660 by George Fox and 11 others. This excerpt is commonly cited:

:All bloody principles and practices we do utterly deny, with all outward wars, and strife, and fightings with outward weapons, for any end, or under any pretence whatsoever, and this is our testimony to the whole world. That [[spirit of Christ]] by which we are guided is not changeable, so as once to command us from a thing as evil and again to move unto it; and we do certainly know, and so testify to the world, that the spirit of Christ, which leads us into all Truth, will never move us to fight and war against any man with outward weapons, neither for the kingdom of Christ, nor for the kingdoms of this world.&lt;ref name="full text two"&gt;''A declaration from the harmless and innocent people of God, called Quakers'', London: 1660, as quoted in: Britain Yearly Meeting [Ed] ''Quaker Faith and Practice: the book of Christian discipline of the Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends in Britain'' London: 1994,  24:04.
The extract quoted is considerably abridged from the original declaration - full text of the original declaration is available: [http://www.quaker.org/minnfm/peace/A%20Declaration%20to%20Charles%20II%201660.htm A Declaration from the harmless and innocent people of God, called Quakers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Quakers initially opposed this statement because it did not deny use of the sword to the magistrate or ruler of the state.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}  It also contained no prohibition against paying taxes for purposes of war, something that would trouble Friends to the present.

== Friends' testimony to peace ==
[[File:NobelPrize2.jpg|thumb|right|In 1947, the Religious Society of Friends was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. The peace testimony of Friends is their best known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1947/press.html The Nobel Peace Prize 1947 - Presentation Speech&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Quakers have engaged in peace testimony by protesting against wars, refusing to serve in armed forces if drafted, seeking [[conscientious objector]] status when available, and even to participating in acts of [[civil disobedience]]. Not all Quakers embrace this testimony as an absolute; for example, there were Friends that fought in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Some others were firm [[:Category:Christian pacifists|Christian pacifists]]. During extreme circumstances it has been difficult for some Quakers to engage in and uphold this testimony, yet Friends have almost universally been committed to the ideal of peace, even those who have felt the need to compromise on their testimony. Apart from the specific question of war, other ways in which [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]] have testified to peace have included [[vegetarianism]] and a commitment to [[restorative justice]].

The Religious Society of Friends was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1947.  The Nobel Prize was awarded to Friends for Friends' work to relieve suffering and feed many millions of starving people during and after both world wars. The Nobel prize was accepted by the [[American Friends Service Committee]], along with the UK's [[Quaker Peace and Social Witness|Friends Service Council]] on behalf of all Quakers.

The first paragraph of the Presentation Speech reads:
"The Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament has awarded this year's Peace Prize to the Quakers, represented by their two great relief organizations, the Friends Service Council in London and the American Friends Service Committee in Philadelphia."&lt;ref&gt;http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1947/press.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Pogopalooza was held in 2004 in a parking lot in [[Nebraska]], organized by [[Dan Brown (blogger)|Dan Brown]], one of the original Xpogo founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pogo Athletes Building Brand New Extreme Sport|url=http://orangeleader.com/v?vid=ndn-23788117&amp;sid=AP%20Editors%20Picks|publisher=The Orange Leader|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the event was small in scope and only drew friends and family, it set the precedent to hold an annual event bringing together extreme pogo athletes from around the country, and eventually the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pogopalooza History|url=http://www.xpogo.com/pogopalooza-history/pogopalooza-1/|publisher=Xpogo.com|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each year since Pogopalooza 1, the event grew in scope and design.  Gaining more structure, media attention, athlete attendance, Pogopalooza progressed steadily for 5 years.  Pogopalooza 6 in 2009, which was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania saw the biggest turnout of athletes yet, over 50+ from across the United States, Canada, and England and involved the whole of the City through four days of events and competition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|last=Maher|first=Kris|title=Boing!

[[The Wall Street Journal]] ran a front-page article on the sport and numerous other countrywide and even international publications began covering athletes, events, and the growth of Xpogo in general.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;  Pogopalooza 7, 8, and 9 represented steady progress as well, leading up to Pogopalooza 10, which stood as another breakout year.   Widely attended and heavily covered, Pogopalooza 10 occurred in New York City across July 26-28th, 2013.  After the event, organizers announced that the Pogopalooza competition would be expanded into a multi-city international touring format for 2014.  Today, the event is referred to as "Pogopalooza: The Xpogo World Championship Series" and occurs multiple times throughout the year in cities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pogopalooza Website|url=http://www.Pogopalooza.com|work=WebPage History|publisher=Xpogo LLC|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xpogo LLC designs and builds the Pogopalooza courses. These courses consist of a series of boxes, ramps, steps, etc., which the jumpers utilize in their runs. The features of the course are most commonly topped with plywood and the frame made from two by fours. The final products are then painted. A new course is constructed for each Pogopalooza and then dismantled afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pogopalooza Facebook Course Album|url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.584611734923110.1073741827.326389647411988&amp;type=3|publisher=Facebook {{!}} Xpogo LLC|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14367">{{Redirect|Possible worlds||Possible Worlds (disambiguation){{!}}Possible Worlds}}

In [[philosophy]] and [[logic]], the concept of a '''possible world''' is used to express [[modal logic|modal claims]]. The concept of possible worlds is common in contemporary philosophical discourse but has been disputed.

== Possibility, necessity, and contingency ==
{{Further|Modal logic#The ontology of possibility}}
Those theorists who use the concept of possible worlds consider the ''actual'' world to be one of the many possible worlds. For each distinct way the world could have been, there is said to be a distinct possible world; the actual world is the one we in fact live in. Among such theorists there is disagreement about the nature of possible worlds; their precise [[Modal logic#The ontology of possibility|ontological status]] is disputed, and especially the difference, if any, in ontological status between the actual world and all the other possible worlds. One position on these matters is set forth in [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s modal realism (see below). There is a close relation between [[proposition]]s and possible worlds. We note that every proposition is either true or false at any given possible world; then the ''[[modal logic|modal status]]'' of a proposition is understood in terms of the ''worlds in which it is true'' and ''worlds in which it is false''. The following are among the assertions we may now usefully make:

* '''[[Truth|True propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in the actual world'' (for example: "[[Richard Nixon]] became president in 1969").
* '''[[Falsity|False propositions]]''' are those that are ''false in the actual world'' (for example: "[[Ronald Reagan]] became president in 1969"). (Reagan did not run for president until 1976, and thus couldn't possibly have been elected.)
* '''[[Logical possibility|Possible propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in at least one possible world'' (for example: "[[Hubert Humphrey]] became president in 1969"). (Humphrey did run for president in 1968, and thus could have been elected.) This includes propositions which are necessarily true, in the sense below.
* '''[[Contradiction|Impossible propositions]]''' (or ''necessarily false propositions'') are those that are ''true in no possible world'' (for example: "Melissa and Toby are taller than each other at the same time").
* '''[[Logical truth|Necessarily true propositions]]''' (often simply called '''necessary propositions''') are those that are ''true in all possible worlds'' (for example: "2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4"; "all bachelors are unmarried").&lt;ref&gt;See "A Priori and A Posteriori" (author: Jason S. Baehr), at ''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/apriori/#H3 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]'': "A necessary proposition is one the truth value of which remains constant across all possible worlds. Thus a necessarily true proposition is one that is true in every possible world, and a necessarily false proposition is one that is false in every possible world. By contrast, the truth value of contingent propositions is not fixed across all possible worlds: for any contingent proposition, there is at least one possible world in which it is true and at least one possible world in which it is false." Accessed 7 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Contingency (philosophy)|Contingent propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in some possible worlds and false in others'' (for example: "[[Richard Nixon]] became president in 1969" is ''contingently false'' and "[[Hubert Humphrey]] became president in 1969" is ''contingently true'').

The idea of possible worlds is most commonly attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]], who spoke of possible worlds as ideas in the mind of [[God]] and used the notion to argue that our actually created world must be "the [[best of all possible worlds]]". [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that on the contrary our world must be the worst of all possible worlds, because if it were only a little worse it could not continue to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, "De Welt als Wille and Vorstellung," supplement to the 4th book "Von der Nichtigkeit und dem Leiden des Lebens" p. 2222, see also R.B. Haldane and J. Kemp's translation [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation/Supplements_to_the_Fourth_Book "On the Vanity and Suffering of Life"] pp 395-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have found implicit earlier traces of the idea of possible worlds in the works of [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;"Nor could we doubt that, if God had created many worlds, they would not be as true in all of them as in this one. Thus those who could examine sufficiently the consequences of these truths and of our rules, could be able to discover effects by their causes, and, to explain myself in the language of the schools, they could have a priori demonstrations of everything that could be produced in this new world." -The World, Chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt; a major influence on Leibniz, [[Al-Ghazali]] (''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''), [[Averroes]] (''[[The Incoherence of the Incoherence]]''),&lt;ref name=Kukkonen&gt;{{citation|title=Possible Worlds in the Tahâfut al-Falâsifa: Al-Ghazâlî on Creation and Contingency|author=Taneli Kukkonen|journal=[[Journal of the History of Philosophy]]|volume=38|issue=4|year=2000|pages=479–502|doi=10.1353/hph.2005.0033}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] (''Matalib al-'Aliya'')&lt;ref name=Setia&gt;{{citation|title=Fakhr Al-Din Al-Razi on Physics and the Nature of the Physical World: A Preliminary Survey|author=Adi Setia|journal=Islam &amp; Science|volume=2|year=2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QYQ/is_2_2/ai_n9532826/|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name=Kukkonen/&gt; The modern philosophical use of the notion was pioneered by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] and [[Saul Kripke]].

== Formal semantics of modal logics ==
{{Main|Modal logic#Semantics}}

A semantics for modal logic was first introduced in the late-1950s work of [[Saul Kripke]] and his colleagues. A statement in modal logic that is ''possible'' is said to be true in at least one possible world; a statement that is ''necessary'' is said to be true in all possible worlds.

== From modal logic to philosophical tool ==
From this groundwork, the theory of possible worlds became a central part of many philosophical developments, from the 1960s onwards &amp;ndash; including, most famously, the analysis of [[counterfactual conditional]]s in terms of "nearby possible worlds" developed by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] and [[Robert Stalnaker]]. On this analysis, when we discuss what ''would'' happen ''if'' some set of conditions ''were'' the case, the truth of our claims is determined by what is true at the nearest possible world (or the ''set'' of nearest possible worlds) where the conditions obtain. (A possible world W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is said to be near to another possible world W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in respect of R to the degree that the same things happen in W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in respect of R; the more different something happens in two possible worlds in a certain respect, the "further" they are from one another in that respect.) Consider this conditional sentence: "If George W. Bush hadn't become president of the U.S. in 2001, Al Gore would have." The sentence would be taken to express a claim that could be reformulated as follows: "In all nearest worlds to our actual world (nearest in relevant respects) where George W. Bush didn't become president of the U.S. in 2001, Al Gore became president of the U.S. then instead." And on this interpretation of the sentence, if there is or are some nearest worlds to the actual world (nearest in relevant respects) where George W. Bush didn't become president but Al Gore didn't either, then the claim expressed by this counterfactual would be false.

Today, possible worlds play a central role in many debates in philosophy, including especially debates over the [[philosophical zombie|Zombie Argument]], and [[physicalism]] and [[supervenience]] in the [[philosophy of mind]]. Many debates in the [[philosophy of religion]] have been reawakened by the use of possible worlds. Intense debate has also emerged over the [[ontology|ontological]] status of possible worlds, provoked especially by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s defense of [[modal realism]], the doctrine that talk about "possible worlds" is best explained in terms of innumerable, ''really existing'' worlds beyond the one we live in. The fundamental question here is: ''given'' that modal logic works, and that some possible-worlds semantics for modal logic is correct, ''what has to be true'' of the world, and just what ''are'' these possible worlds that we range over in our interpretation of modal statements? Lewis argued that what we range over are real, concrete ''worlds'' that exist just as unequivocally as our actual world exists, but that are distinguished from the actual world simply by standing in no spatial, temporal, or causal relations with the actual world. (On Lewis's account, the only "special" property that the ''actual'' world has is a relational one: that ''we'' are in it. This doctrine is called "the indexicality of actuality": "actual" is a merely [[indexicality|indexical]] term, like "now" and "here".) Others, such as [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] and [[William Lycan]], reject Lewis's picture as metaphysically extravagant, and suggest in its place an interpretation of possible worlds as consistent, maximally complete sets of descriptions of or propositions about the world, so that a "possible world" is conceived of as a complete ''description'' of ''a way the world could be'' &amp;ndash; rather than a ''world that is that way''. (Lewis describes their position, and similar positions such as those advocated by [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Peter Forrest (philosopher)|Peter Forrest]], as "''ersatz'' modal realism", arguing that such theories try to get the benefits of possible worlds semantics for modal logic "on the cheap", but that they ultimately fail to provide an adequate explanation.) [[Saul Kripke]], in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', took explicit issue with Lewis's use of possible worlds semantics, and defended a ''stipulative'' account of possible worlds as purely ''formal'' (logical) entities rather than either really existent worlds or as some set of propositions or descriptions.

== Possible-world theory in literary studies ==
Possible worlds theory in literary studies uses concepts from possible-world logic and applies them to worlds that are created by fictional texts, [[fictional universe]]. In particular, possible-world theory provides a useful vocabulary and conceptual framework with which to describe such worlds. However, a literary world is a specific type of possible world, quite distinct from the possible worlds in logic. This is because a literary text houses its own system of modality, consisting of actual worlds (actual events) and possible worlds (possible events). In fiction, the principle of simultaneity, it extends to cover the dimensional aspect, when it is contemplated that two or more physical objects, realities, perceptions and objects non-physical, can coexist in the same space-time.{{vague|date=April 2015}} Thus, a literary universe is granted autonomy in much the same way as the actual universe.

Literary critics, such as [[Marie-Laure Ryan]], [[Lubomír Doležel]], and [[Thomas Pavel]], have used possible-worlds theory to address notions of literary truth, the nature of fictionality, and the relationship between fictional worlds and reality. Taxonomies of fictional possibilities have also been proposed where the likelihood of a fictional world is assessed. Possible-world theory is also used within narratology to divide a specific text into its constituent worlds, possible and actual. In this approach, the modal structure of the fictional text is analysed in relation to its [[narrative]] and thematic concerns. [[Rein Raud]] has extended this approach onto "cultural" worlds, comparing possible worlds to the particular constructions of reality of different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;"Identity, Difference and Cultural Worlds", in Lang, V. &amp; Kull, K. (eds) (2014) Estonian Approaches to Culture Theory. Approaches to Culture Theory 4, 164–179. University of Tartu Press, Tartu, https://www.academia.edu/9128313/Identity_Difference_and_Cultural_Worlds&lt;/ref&gt; However, the metaphor of the "cultural possible worlds" relates to the framework of [[cultural relativism]] and, depending on the ontological status ascribed to possible worlds, warrants different, often controversial claims ranging from ethnocentrism to cultural imperialism.

The '''Professional-Managerial class''' was an influential [[New Class]] hypothesis in [[social science]] in the United States in the 1970s by John and [[Barbara Ehrenreich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrenreich|first=John| title=Between Labor and Capital|year=1979|publisher=South End Press|location=Boston|isbn=0-89608-037-4|edition=1st|author2=Barbara Ehrenreich |editor=Pat Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ehrenreichs hypothesized a [[social class]] within [[capitalism]] that, by controlling production processes through superior management skills, was neither [[proletarian]] nor [[bourgeois]]. This hypothesis contributed to the [[Marxist]] debates on class in [[Fordism]] and was used as an analytical category in the examination of non-proletarian employees.

This group of [[middle class]] professionals is distinguished from other social classes by their training and education, typically business qualifications and university degrees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Philip|first=Green|title=Retrieving Democracy: In Search of Civic Equality|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/middle-class#cite_note-25|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt; with occupations including [[academics]], [[teachers]], [[social workers]], [[engineers]], [[managers]], [[nurses]], and middle-level [[Administrator (business)|administrators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kellner|first=Hansfried|title=Hidden Technocrats: The New Class and New Capitalism|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/middle-class#cite_note-26|publisher=Transaction Publishers|author2=Frank W. Heuberger |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The professional-managerial class tends to have incomes above the average for their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gail|first=Kelly|title=Women's higher education in comparative perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-CKcuRAu8EC&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=Professional+Managerial+Class+salary&amp;q=Professional+Managerial+Class+salary&amp;hl=en#v=snippet&amp;q=Professional%20Managerial%20Class%20salary&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer|author2=Sheila Slaughter |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that in the [[United States]] during 1930, people in professional-managerial class occupations made up less than 1 percent of total employment. In 1972, about 24 percent of American jobs were in professional-managerial class occupations. By 1983 the number had risen to 28 percent and in 2006, 35 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|title=Barbara and John Ehrenreich: The Real Story Behind the Crash and Burn of America's Managerial Class|url=http://www.alternet.org/economy/barbara-and-john-ehrenreich-real-story-behind-crash-and-burn-americas-managerial-class?page=0%2C0|work=AlterNet|accessdate=18 November 2013|author2=John Ehrenreich |date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>I added a reference to a book that discusses the concept of fulfillment.</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5553">In philosophy and psychology, '''self-fulfillment''' is the realizing of one's deepest desires and capacities. The history of this concept can be traced to [[Ancient Greek]] philosophers and it still remains a notable concept in modern philosophy.

==Definition and history==
Philosopher [[Alan Gewirth]] in his book ''Self-Fulfillment'' defined self-fulfillment as "carrying to fruition one's deepest desires or one's worthiest capacities."&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; Another definition states that self-fulfillment is "the attainment of a satisfying and worthwhile life well lived."&lt;ref name="Kerr2009"/&gt; It is an [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] that can be traced to [[Ancient Greek]] philosophers, and one that has been common and popular in both Western and non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; Self-fulfillment is often seen as superior to other values and goals.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;

Gewirth notes that "to seek for a good human life is to seek for self-fulfillment".&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; However, in modern philosophy, the ideal of self-fulfillment has become less popular, criticized by thinkers such as [[Hobbes]] and [[Freud]], who feel there are conceptual and moral problems associated with it.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; It has been called an [[Egotism|egoistic]] concept, impossible to achieve, with some suggesting that it is an obsolete concept that should be abandoned.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;  Moral philosophers focus less on obtaining a good life, and more on interpersonal relations and duties owed to others.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;  Similarly, whereas [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] saw the goal of the [[polis]] in providing a means of self-fulfillment to citizens, modern governments have given up on that, focusing rather on maintaining [[civic order]].&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; Despite the criticism, the concept of self-fulfillment still persists in modern philosophy, its usefulness defended by thinkers such as Gewirth himself.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;

Gewirth noted that the term self-fulfillment has two near [[synonyms]]: [[self-realization]] and [[self-actualization]], used respectively by philosophers and humanist psychologists, whereas the term self-fulfillment is more commonly used outside those expert fields.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-6-8"/&gt; Gewirth however argues that this concept is sufficiently different from those others to merit not being used as a synonym.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-6-8"/&gt; Self-actualization in particular, often discussed in the context of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], is frequently defined as the "need for self-fulfillment".&lt;ref name="ReeceBrandt2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PastorinoDoyle-Portillo2012"/&gt;

Dr. Ben Carvosso in his book ''Life CEO - Take Charge, and start doing your life's work, not your busy work'' discussed the prevalence of individuals who's lives are busy, full but unfulfilled. Individuals who's lives are unfulfilled because something is missing and who come to the mistaken conclusion (driven by cleaver marketing by big corporations) that the solution is work harder and make more money to somehow make more time. Self-fulfillment comes from knowing what you really want, not what society says you should want.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1041112060|title=Life CEO : take charge and start doing your life's work not your busy work|last=Ben,|first=Carvosso,|isbn=9780648216704|location=[place of publication not identified]|oclc=1041112060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its only when we connect with what we really want that we experience true joy or [[Eudaimonia]].

Self-fulfillment has been positively connected to [[altruism]].&lt;ref name="Kerr2009"/&gt;

'''Simon Baron-Cohen''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA|FBPsS}} (born 15 August 1958) is an English [[clinical psychologist]], professor of [[developmental psychopathology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=ARCBio/&gt; He is the Director of the University's [[Autism Research Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/arc_people |title= ARC researchers, collaborators and staff |publisher=Autism Research Center, University of Cambridge |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]].&lt;ref name=ARCBio&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/people_Baron-Cohen |title= ARC people: Professor Simon Baron-Cohen |publisher=Autism Research Center, University of Cambridge |accessdate= 28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 he formulated the [[mind-blindness]] theory of [[autism]], the evidence for which was collated in his 1995 book. In 1997, he formulated the [[fetus|fetal]] [[sex steroid]] theory of autism, the key test of which was published in 2015. He has also made major contributions to the fields of typical cognitive sex differences, autism prevalence and screening, autism genetics, autism [[neuroimaging]], autism and technical ability, and [[synaesthesia]].

==Personal life and education==
Baron-Cohen completed a BA in [[Human Sciences]] at [[New College, Oxford]], and an MPhil in Clinical Psychology at the [[Institute of Psychiatry]], [[King's College London]]. He completed a PhD in [[Psychology]] at [[University College London]];&lt;ref name=ARCBio/&gt; his doctoral research was in collaboration with his supervisor [[Uta Frith]].&lt;ref name= PMC2409181&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bishop |first=Dorothy V.

He married Bridget Lindley, a family rights lawyer, in 1987. She died in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Bridget Lindley OBE |url=https://www.familylaw.co.uk/news_and_comment/obituary-bridget-lindley-obe |work=Family Law|date=26 April 2016 |accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Bridget Lindley |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bridget-lindley-d8h3s05mz |work=[[The Times]] |date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron-Cohen has three children, the eldest of whom is screenwriter and director Sam Baron.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; He has an elder brother [[Dan Baron Cohen]] and three younger siblings, brother [[Ash Baron-Cohen]] and sisters Suzie and Liz.&lt;ref name="thejc"&gt;{{cite news |title=Simon Baron-Cohen: My special sister Suzie |url=http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/essays/117453/simon-baron-cohen-my-special-sister-suzie |newspaper=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] |date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their cousin is the actor and comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/life-and-society/2007/02/baron-cohen-autism-children |title=Time Out with Nick Cohen |work= [[New Statesman]] |date= 26 February 2007 |accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=QA&gt;{{cite news |url=http://healthland.time.com/2011/05/30/mind-reading-psychologist-simon-baron-cohen-on-empathy-and-the-science-of-evil/ |title=Q&amp;A: Psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen on empathy and the science of evil |author=Szalavitz, Maia |work=Time |date=30 May 2011 |accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baron-Cohen's surname includes a hyphen—which is not the case with most other members of his family—because of a typographical error in his first professional article; he never had the error corrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Glazer |first=Sarah |url=http://www.momentmag.com/the-provocative-baron-cohen-clan/7/ |title=The Provocative Baron Cohen Clan - Page 7 of 9 |newspaper=[[Moment Magazine|Moment]] |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autism research==
While he was a member of the Cognitive Development Unit (CDU) in [[London]], in 1985 Baron-Cohen was lead author of the first study, published with [[Alan M. Leslie]] and Uta Frith, which proposed a correlation between children with [[autism]] and delays in the development of a [[theory of mind]], known as ToM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 |title=Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? |date=October 1985 |last1=Baron-Cohen |first1=Simon |last2=Leslie |first2=Alan M. |last3=Frith |first3=Uta |authorlink1=Simon Baron-Cohen |authorlink2=Alan M. Leslie |authorlink3=Uta Frith |journal=[[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=37–46 |pmid=2934210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFARI&gt;{{cite web |url= https://sfari.org/news-and-opinion/classic-paper-reviews/2008/1985-paper-on-the-theory-of-mind-commentary-by-rebecca-saxe |title= 1985 paper on the theory of mind |author= Saxe, Rebecca |date= 9 May 2008 |accessdate=28 December 2013 |publisher=[[Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative|SFARI]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229005056/https://sfari.org/news-and-opinion/classic-paper-reviews/2008/1985-paper-on-the-theory-of-mind-commentary-by-rebecca-saxe |archivedate=29 December 2013 |df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theory of mind is the ability to imagine other people's emotions and thoughts, and it is a skill that according to Baron-Cohen's research is typically delayed developmentally in children with autism.&lt;ref name="SFARI"/&gt;

[[File:Professor Simon Baron-Cohen.jpg|thumb|Baron-Cohen in 2011]]
Baron-Cohen and his colleagues discovered in 1987 the first evidence that experiences in [[synaesthesia]] remain consistent over time; they also found synaesthesia to be measurable via neuroimaging techniques.&lt;ref name=Synth&gt;{{cite news|author= Carpenter, Siri |url= http://www.apa.org/monitor/mar01/synesthesia.aspx |title= Everyday fantasia: The world of synesthesia |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |date= March 2001 |volume=32 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His team has investigated whether synaesthesia is connected to autism.&lt;ref name=StudyLinks&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24995232 |date=19 November 2013 |author=Briggs, Helen |title=Study links synaesthesia to autism |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 Baron-Cohen developed the [[Empathizing–systemizing theory|empathising–systemising theory]]. His theory is that a cognitive profile with a systemising drive that is stronger than empathising is associated with maths, science and technology skills, and exists in families with [[autism spectrum]] disorders. He suspects that if individuals with a "systemising" focus are [[assortative mating|selecting each other as mates]], they are more likely to have children with autism.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news |author= Warner, Judith |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2089358,00.html |title=Autism's lone wolf |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=29 August 2011 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific American 2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-geeky-couples-more-likely-to-have-kids-with-autism/ |author=Baron-Cohen, Simon |title=Are geeky couples more likely to have kids with autism? |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=9 November 2012 |accessdate=14 April 2018}}{{subscription required}} [https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/publications/download.php?id=20821 Pdf].

In this way, assortative mating between technical-minded people might spread autism genes."&lt;ref name="Scientific American 2012" /&gt;

According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, his views on systemising traits had "earned him the ire of some parents of autistic children, who complain that he underestimates their families' suffering".&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; ''Time'' said that while research from [[Washington University in St. Louis]] did not support the assortive mating theory, a survey finding that autism was twice as high in Eindhoven (the Silicon Valley of the Netherlands) had "breathed new life" into Baron-Cohen's theory.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; The theory has received further support in 2016.&lt;ref name=Spectrum&gt;{{Cite news |last=DeWeerdt |first=Sarah |url=https://spectrumnews.org/news/partner-preferences-may-contribute-autism-prevalence/ |title=Partner preferences may contribute to autism prevalence |date=5 December 2016 |newspaper=[[spectrumnews.org|Spectrum]] |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron-Cohen's work in systemising-empathising led him to investigate whether higher levels of fetal [[testosterone]] explain the increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorders among males;&lt;ref name="Scientific American 2012"/&gt; his theory is known as the "[[extreme male brain]]" theory of autism.&lt;ref name=QA/&gt; A review of his book ''The Essential Difference'' published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2003 summarises his proposal as: "the male brain is programmed to systemize and the female brain to empathize&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Asperger's syndrome represents the extreme male brain".&lt;ref name= Benenson&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Benenson, Joyce F. |title=Sex on the brain |year=2003 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume= 424 |issue= 6945 |pages=132–133 |doi=10.1038/424132b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say that because his work has focused on higher-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorders, it requires independent replication with broader samples.&lt;ref name="Buchen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buchen, Lizzie |title=Scientists and autism: When geeks meet |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/111102/full/479025a.html |journal=Nature |date=November 2011 |volume=479 |issue=7371 |pages=25–7 |doi=10.1038/479025a |pmid=22051657}}&lt;/ref&gt; His prediction that prenatal testosterone would be elevated in autism has been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/children-with-autism-have-elevated-levels-of-steroid-hormones-in-the-womb |title=Children with autism have elevated levels of steroid hormones in the womb |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]  |date=3 June 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 he developed the [[autism-spectrum quotient]], a set of fifty questions that can be used to help determine whether or not an adult exhibits symptoms of autism.&lt;ref name=Woodbury-Smith&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders]] |date=June 2005 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=331–5 |title= Screening adults for Asperger Syndrome using the AQ: a preliminary study of its diagnostic validity in clinical practice |vauthors=Woodbury-Smith MR, Robinson J, Wheelwright S, Baron-Cohen S |doi=10.1007/s10803-005-3300-7 |pmid=16119474 |url=http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2005_Woodbury-Smith_etal_ScreeningAdultsForAS.pdf |format=PDF |citeseerx=10.1.1.653.8639}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AQ has subsequently been used in hundreds of studies including one study of half a million people, showing robust sex differences and higher scores in those who work in STEM ([[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-of-half-a-million-people-reveals-sex-and-job-predict-how-many-autistic-traits-you-have |title=Study of half a million people reveals sex and job predict how many autistic traits you have |date=3 November 2015 |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron-Cohen developed the Mindreading software for special education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jkp.com/mindreading/faq.php#_3 |title=Mind Reading: Frequently Asked Questions: Who developed it? |publisher=[[Jessica Kingsley Publishers]] |accessdate=28 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228082143/http://www.jkp.com/mindreading/faq.php#_3 |archivedate=28 December 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was nominated for an award from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA) interactive award in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/2002/interactive/offline-learning |title= BAFTA Awards: Interactive: Offline Learning in 2002 |publisher=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] |accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lab developed ''[[The Transporters]]'', an animation series designed to teach children with autism to recognise and understand emotions. The series was also nominated for a BAFTA award.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/2007/childrens/learning-primary |title=BAFTA Awards: Children's: Learning – Primary in 2007 |publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts |accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Criticisms===
{{see|Empathizing–systemizing theory#Criticism}}
Baron-Cohen has been criticized for his "empathizing-systemizing theory", which claims that humans may be classified on the basis of their scores along two dimensions (empathizing and systemizing); and that females tend to score higher on the empathizing dimension and males tend to score higher on the systemizing dimension.  Columnist at ''[[The Guardian]]'' [[Madeleine Bunting]] has summarized some of these aspects in the 2010 article "The truth about sex difference is that if men are from Mars, so are women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The truth about sex difference is that if men are from Mars, so are women |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/14/women-men-differences-science-stereotypes |last=Bunting |first=Madeleine |authorlink=Madeleine Bunting |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=[[Kings Place]], London |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=14 November 2010 |accessdate=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some research in systemizing and empathizing in early life indicates that boys and girls develop in similar ways, casting considerable doubt on the theory of sex differences in these areas.&lt;ref name=Nash&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nash |first1=Alison |last2=Grossi |first2=Giordana |author-link2 = Giordana Grossi |date=2007 |title=Picking Barbie™'s Brain: Inherent Sex Differences in Scientific Ability? |journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary Feminist Thought |volume=2 |issue=1 |url=http://digitalcommons.salve.edu/jift/vol2/iss1/5}} [http://digitalcommons.salve.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=jift Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences'' characterized ''The Essential Difference'' as "very disappointing" with a "superficial notion of intelligence", concluding that Baron-Cohen's major claims about mind-blindness and systemizing–empathizing are "at best, dubious".&lt;ref name= Levy&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levy |first=Neil |title=Book review: Understanding blindness |journal=Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=315–324 |doi=10.1023/B:PHEN.0000049328.20506.a1 |date=September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' magazine has also criticized the assortative mating theory proposed by Baron-Cohen, claiming that it is largely speculative and based on anecdotal evidence. The theory claims that autism rates are increasing because "systemizers", individuals with more autistic traits, are more likely to marry each other and are more likely to have autistic offspring due to relatively recent societal changes.&lt;ref name="Assortative"&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Melnick|first1=Meredith|title=Could the Way We Mate and Marry Boost Rates of Autism?|url=http://healthland.time.com/2011/08/19/could-the-way-we-mate-and-marry-boost-rates-of-autism/ |magazine=Time |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2009 study led by Baron-Cohen which reported that autistic individuals possessed superior [[visual acuity]] has been subject to heavy criticism.  The developers of the software he used said that his results were impossible based on the technology used in the study.  Additionally, the results of the study could not be replicated in a follow-up study.&lt;ref name="BachDakin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bach |first1=Michael |last2=Dakin |first2=Steven C. |title=Regarding "Eagle-Eyed Visual Acuity: An Experimental Investigation of Enhanced Perception in Autism" |journal=[[Biological Psychiatry (journal)|Biological Psychiatry]] |date=November 2009 |volume=66 |issue=10 |pages=e19–e20 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.02.035 |pmid=19576570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CloseEye"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bölte |first1=Sven |last2=Schlitt |first2=Sabine |last3=Gapp |first3=Volker |last4=Hainz |first4=Daniela |last5=Schirman |first5=Shella |last6=Poustka |first6=Fritz |last7=Weber |first7=Bernhard |last8=Freitag |first8=Christine |last9=Ciaramidaro |first9=Angela |last10=Walter |first10=Henrik |title=A Close Eye on the Eagle-Eyed Visual Acuity Hypothesis of Autism |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |date=10 June 2011 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=726–733 |doi=10.1007/s10803-011-1300-3 |pmid=21660498 |pmc=3324676}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Discover"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Teresa |first1=Tavassoli |last2=Keziah |first2=Latham |last3=Mihael |first3=Bach |last4=Steven C. |first4=Dakin |last5=Simon |first5=Baron-Cohen |title=Psychophysical measures of visual acuity in autism spectrum conditions |journal=[[Vision Research]] |date=August 2011 |volume=51 |issue=15 |pages=1778-80 |doi=10.1016/j.visres.2011.06.004 |pmid=21704058}} Discussed in {{cite news |title=Eagle-Eyed Autism?

Baron-Cohen's supposition that [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Albert Einstein]] displayed autistic traits has been met with skepticism by [[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]] psychiatrist Glenn Elliot. Elliot views attempting to diagnose on the basis of biographical information as extremely unreliable, and claims that any behaviour can have various causes.&lt;ref name="HistoricalFigures"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Muir |first1=Hazel |title=Einstein and Newton showed signs of autism |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3676-einstein-and-newton-showed-signs-of-autism/ |magazine=[[New Scientist]] |date=30 April 2003 |accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6829">The '''staircase model''' is a psychological explanation as to why out of large numbers of disgruntled people in society, only a very small minority end up committing acts of [[terrorism]]. It was proposed in 2005 by [[Fathali M. Moghaddam]] in his paper "The Staircase to Terrorism".&lt;ref name=staircase&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moghaddam |first=Fathali |authorlink=Fathali M. Moghaddam |date=Feb–Mar 2005 |title=The Staircase to Terrorism |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |publisher= |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=161–169 |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.60.2.161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model involves a metaphorical staircase, where each step is influenced by a specific psychological process. It is proposed that the higher an individual moves up the staircase, the fewer alternatives to violence they will see, ultimately resulting in the destruction of themselves, others, or both.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;

==Background==
Moghaddam observed that societal-level variables, such as lack of democratic processes, [[social inequality]], availability of weapons and rapid demographic changes, do not explain why only a small percentage of people living under the same adverse conditions end up committing acts of violence against innocent targets. He proposed the staircase model to explain this phenomenon, describing the pathway to terrorism as a narrowing staircase, that very few people reach the top of.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hewstone |first1=Miles |authorlink1=Miles Hewstone |last2=Stroebe |first2=Wolfgang |author-link2= Wolfgang Stroebe|last3=Jonas |first3=Klaus |date=May 14, 2012 |title=An Introduction to Social Psychology|edition=5th|publisher=BPS Blackwell |pages=305–306 |isbn=978-1444335446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==
The model involves six floors.&lt;ref name=staircase/&gt;&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;&lt;ref name=scand/&gt;
[[File:Staircase model.png|thumb|Diagram of the staircase model]]

===Ground floor===
The ground floor is inhabited by all members of society. All members of society evaluate their [[Standard of living|living conditions]] in terms of fairness. People will remain on the ground floor as long as they consider their living conditions to be fair. Those who perceive injustice move onto the first floor.&lt;ref name=staircase/&gt;&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

===First floor===
On the first floor, people consider their options for improving their situation. People who find options to improve their individual situation and influence decision-makers leave the staircase at this floor in order to pursue non-violent paths. People who are unsatisfied with their available options move onto the second floor.&lt;ref name=staircase/&gt;&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

===Second floor===
It is here that feelings of both anger and frustration over not being able to improve the situation instigate a search for a target to blame. This target can either be a direct opponent, such as a government, or a third party to whom aggression is displaced, such as an [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or religious group. People who are persuaded that they have an enemy toward whom they can direct their [[aggression]], will proceed to the third floor.&lt;ref name=staircase/&gt;&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

===Third floor===
People who arrive here have already developed a readiness towards violence. These feelings can be capitalised on by a violent organisation that is offering a sense of 'moral engagement' to potential recruits. Within these organisations violent actions against a perceived enemy are regarded as acceptable or even as one's duty. Potential recruits are offered a new social identity as members of a selective [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]] who aim to bring justice to the world. People who find this offer appealing will move on to the fourth floor.&lt;ref name=staircase/&gt;&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

===Fourth floor===
It is here that thinking such as 'us' versus 'them' is promoted. Recruits are isolated from friends and family, strict secrecy is imposed and the legitimacy of the organisation is emphasised. People who reach this floor will rarely withdraw and exit the staircase alive. They will move onto the fifth floor if an opportunity to do so presents.&lt;ref name=staircase/&gt;&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

===Fifth floor===
It is here that the violent act is carried out. In order to be as effective as possible, any inhibition about killing innocent people must be overcome. This is done via two means. [[Categorization|Categorisation]] stresses the differentiation between ingroup and out group, and [[Distancing (psychology)|distancing]] exaggerates the differences between the ingroup and the perceived enemy.&lt;ref name=staircase/&gt;&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

==Implications==
Moghaddam states the model is not a formal one, but rather a metaphor for the purpose of providing general framework in order to organise current psychological knowledge regarding terrorism.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laurence |first1=Janice |last2=Matthews |first2=Michael |date=February 24, 2012 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Military Psychology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yh9pAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71 |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=71 |isbn= 978-0195399325  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the model is cited as useful for conceptualising the process that results in only a small number of individuals from a large group of disgruntled people will commit acts of violence against the innocent.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; Moghaddam states that it is not enough to simply try and identify and stop potential terrorists, as this will only make room for new people to step forward, and instead proposes that the only way to end terrorism is by reforming the condition on the ground floor so that it is no longer perceived as unjust and hopeless by a large portion of society.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

The empirical basis of the model has been evaluated&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; by an article in the [[Scandinavian Journal of Psychology]]. The findings state that whilst most of the processes in the model are supported by empirical evidence, the quantity and quality of said evidence varies.&lt;ref name=scand&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ragnhild |first=Lygre |last2= |first2= |date=2011 |title=Terrorism as a process: A critical review of Moghaddam's 'Staircase to Terrorism' |url= |journal= Scandinavian Journal of Psychology |volume=52 |issue=6 |page=615 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst praising Moghaddam's model for emphasising potential mechanisms for future study, the review concludes that the staircase model may not be the right metaphor for summarising the phenomena of terrorism, citing a lack of evidence for transition between the floors, and the possibility that some floors and corresponding processes from the model could be removed entirely due to a lack of empirical evidence.&lt;ref name=scand/&gt;

'''Sust 'n' Able''' is the [[Woodcraft Folk]]'s programme of education for [[sustainable development]].
[[Image:sustnable.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Sust'N'Able Logo]]

The project was the theme of the Woodcraft Folk's 2001 international camp in [[Nottinghamshire]] where 4,000 young people attended. The camp focused on sustainable development education and ran activates for children from five to twenty five around the themes.

At the camp a simulation game took place called '''World on a Tight Rope'', it ran the length of the camp and involved people working for credits to create a more sustainable world. The simulation included two 'Earth Summits' held at the camp to come up with a declaration to the world's leaders at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD). The Earth Summit had "action stations" where people debated the issues to be included in the declaration.

==The declaration and delegation==
The Declaration created as part of the simulation game was presented by a delegation of 11 young people. The delegation attended the [[United Nations]]' [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] including both the civil society and the official political areas of the summit. The group worked with the [[International Falcon Movement - Socialist Education International]] delegation attending the summit.

Delegations from Woodcraft Folk attend all the [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] meetings in [[New York City]] which are follow-up meetings to the annual WSSD, with thematic cycles changing every two years.

{{distinguish|Empathy}}
'''Sympathy''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''syn'' "together" and ''pathos'' "feeling" which means "fellow-feeling") is the perception, understanding, and reaction to the distress or need of another [[life form]].&lt;ref name="Decety 2010 886–899"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tear|first=J|author2=Michalska, KJ |title=Neurodevelopmental changes in the circuits underlying empathy and sympathy from childhood to adulthood|journal=Developmental Science|year=2010|volume=13|issue=6|pages=886–899|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00940.x|pmid=20977559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This empathic concern is driven by a switch in viewpoint, from a personal perspective to the perspective of another group or individual who is in need.

==Etymology==
The words ''[[empathy]]'' and ''sympathy'' are often used interchangeably. Sympathy is a [[feeling]], but the two terms have distinct origins and meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lishner|first=D. A.|author2=Batson, C. D. |author3=Huss, E. |title=Tenderness and Sympathy: Distinct Empathic Emotions Elicited by Different Forms of Need|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2011|volume=37|issue=5|pages=614–625|doi=10.1177/0146167211403157}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Merriam-Webster]] defines ''empathy'' as "the action of understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experience of another of either the past or present without having the feelings, thoughts, and experience fully communicated in an objectively explicit manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empathy|website=Merriam-Webster|title=Definition of empathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merriam-Webster defines that sympathy is when you share the feelings of another; empathy is when you understand the feelings of another but do not necessarily share them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's the difference between sympathy and empathy?|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/sympathy-empathy-difference|website=Merriam Webster|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sympathy|website=Merriam-Webster|title=Definition of sympathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ''sympathy'' was defined by 18th century philosophers such as Adam Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bloom|first1=Paul|title=Against Empathy|url=http://www.bostonreview.net/forum/paul-bloom-against-empathy|publisher=Boston Review|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Grammarist.com defines ''sympathy'' as "the feeling that you care about and are sorry about someone else's trouble, grief, misfortune, etc."; "a feeling of support for something"; or "a state in which different people share the same interests, opinions, goals, etc.", but not necessarily the feeling that you share another person's emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Empathy vs. sympathy|url=http://grammarist.com/usage/empathy-sympathy/|publisher=Grammarist|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

In order to get an experience of sympathy there are specific conditions that need to occur. These include: attention to a subject, believing that a person/group is in a state of need, and the specific characteristics of a given situation. An individual must first give his or her attention to a person/group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dickert|first=S|author2=Slovic, P |title=Attentional mechanisms in the generation of sympathy|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|year=2009|volume=4|issue=4|pages=297–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distractions severely limit the ability to produce strong affective responses. Without distractions, people are able to attend to and respond to a variety of emotional subjects and experiences. Attention facilitates the experience of sympathy, and without giving undivided attention to many situations sympathy cannot be experienced.

The need of an individual/group is also considered to elicit sympathy. Varying states of need (such as perceived vulnerability or pain) require unique human reactions, ranging from attention to sympathy. A person with cancer might draw a stronger feeling of sympathy than a person with a cold. The conditions which sympathy is deemed as an appropriate response are organized into individual differences and situational differences.

The ways in which people think about human deservingness, interdependence, and vulnerability motivate sympathy. A person who seems 'deserving' of aid is more likely to be helped.&lt;ref name="Lowenstein 2007 112–126"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowenstein|first=G.|author2=Small, D. A. |title=The scarecrow and the tin man: The vicissitudes of human sympathy and caring|journal=Review of General Psychology|year=2007|volume=11|issue=2|pages=112–126|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.11.2.112}}&lt;/ref&gt; A belief in human interdependence fuels sympathetic behavior.

Sympathy is also believed to be based on the principle of the powerful helping the vulnerable (young, elderly, sick).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Djiker|first=A. J. M.|title=Perceived vulnerability as a common basis of moral emotions|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|year=2010|volume=49|pages=415–423|doi=10.1348/014466609x482668}}&lt;/ref&gt; This desire to help the vulnerable has been suggested to stem from the paternalistic nature of humans, in which they seek to protect and aid the children and the weak in their survival. People help others based on maternal/paternal instincts to care for their own children or family when they are in need.

Individual moods, previous experiences, social connections, novelty, salience, and spatial proximity can also influence the experience of sympathy.&lt;ref name="Lowenstein 2007 112–126"/&gt; Individuals experiencing positive mood states and people who have similar life experiences are more likely to produce sympathy.

Spatial proximity, or when a person or group exists close geographically (such as neighbors and citizens of a given country), they will more likely experience sympathy towards each other. Similarly, ''social'' proximity follows the same pattern. Members of certain groups (ex. racial groups) favor people who are also members of groups similar to their own.&lt;ref name="Lowenstein 2007 112–126"/&gt; Social proximity is intimately linked  with in-group and out-group status. In-group status, or a person falling within a certain social group, is also integral to the experience of sympathy. Both of these processes are based on the notion that people within the same group are interconnected and share successes and failures and therefore experience more sympathy towards each other than to out-group members, or social outsiders.

New and emotionally provoking situations also represent an explanation for empathic emotions, such as sympathy. People seem to habituate to events that are similar in content and type and strength of emotion. The first horrific event that is witnessed will elicit a greater sympathetic response compared to the subsequent experiences of the same horrific event.

==Evolutionary origins==
The evolution of sympathy is tied directly into the development of [[social intelligence]]. Social intelligence references a broad range of behaviors, and their associated cognitive skills, such as pair bonding, the creation of social hierarchies, and alliance formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dautenhahn|first=Kerstin|title=I Could Be You: The Phenomenological Dimension Of Social Understanding|journal=Cybernetics and Systems|date=1 July 1997|volume=28|issue=5|pages=417–453|doi=10.1080/019697297126074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers theorize that empathic emotions, or those relating to the emotions of others, arose due to reciprocal altruism, mother-child bonding, and the need to accurately estimate the future actions of conspecifics. In other words, empathic emotions were driven by the desire to create relationships that were mutually beneficial and to better understand the emotions of others that could avert danger or stimulate positive outcomes. By working together, there were better results for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Vignemont|first=Frederique|author2=Singer, Tania |title=The empathic brain: how, when and why?|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=1 October 2006|volume=10|issue=10|pages=435–441|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social order is improved when people are able to provide aid to others when it is a detriment to oneself for the good of the greater society. For example, giving back to the community often leads to personal benefits.
 
The conditions necessary to develop empathic concerns, and later sympathy, begin with the creation of a small group of socially dependent individuals. Second, the individuals in this community must have a relatively long lifespan in order to encounter several opportunities to react with sympathy. Parental care relationships, alliances during conflicts, and the creation of social hierarchies are also associated with the onset of sympathy in human interactions. Sympathetic behavior originally came about during dangerous situations, such as predator sightings, and moments when aid was needed for the sick and/or wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|year=1971|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of sympathy as a social catalyst can be seen in both primate species and in human development.

==Communication==
Verbal communication is the clearest medium by which individuals are able to communicate feelings of sympathy. People can express sympathy by addressing the emotions being felt by themselves and others involved and by acknowledging the current environmental conditions for why sympathy would be the appropriate reaction.

Nonverbal communication presents a fascinating study of speech intonation, facial expression, bodily motions and person-to-person physical contacts. Some other forms of nonverbal communication include how far people position themselves in relation to each other, posture and appearance. These forms of expression can convey messages related to emotion as well as opinions, physical states (fatigue), and understanding. Emotional expression is especially linked to the production of emotion-specific facial expressions. These expressions are often the same from culture to culture and are often reproduced by observers, which facilitates the observers' own understanding of the emotion and/or situation.  There are six universal emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust and anger.

[[File:Portret van een man005.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Facial expressions can communicate sympathy and other emotions nonverbally.]]

Nonverbal communication cues are often subconscious and difficult to control. Deliberate regulation of emotion and nonverbal expression is often imperfect. Nonverbal gestures and facial expressions are also generally better understood by people observing the gestures, expressions, etc., and not by the person experiencing them first hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DePaulo|first=B. M.|title=Nonverbal behavior and self-presentation|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1992|volume=111|issue=2|pages=203–243|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.2.203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communicating using physical touch has the unique ability of conveying affective information upon contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=R.|author2=Quek, F. |title=Touch &amp; talk: Contextualizing remote touch for affective interaction|journal=Proceedings of the fourth international conference on Tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction|year=2010|pages=13–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, this sensation must be paired with the understanding of the specific context of a given situation. The touch of the hand on the shoulder during a funeral might be the fastest method of conveying sympathy. Patting a person on their back, arms, or head for a few seconds can effectively convey feelings of sympathy between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hertenstein|first=Matthew J. |author2=Holmes, Rachel |author3=McCullough, Margaret |author4=Keltner, Dacher|title=The communication of emotion via touch.|journal=Emotion|year=2009|volume=9|issue=4|pages=566–573|doi=10.1037/a0016108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonverbal communication seems to provide a more genuine communication of sympathy, because it is difficult to control nonverbal behavior and expressions. The combination of verbal and nonverbal communication facilitates the acknowledgment and comprehension of sympathy.

==Human behavior==
Although sympathy is a well-known term, the implications of sympathy found in the study of human behavior are often less clear. Decision-making, an integral part of human behavior, involves the weighing of costs with potential outcomes. Research on decision-making has been divided into two mechanisms, often labeled "System 1" and "System 2." These two systems, representing the gut and the head respectively, influence decisions based on context and the individual characteristics of the people involved. Sympathy is an agent working in System 1, a system that uses affective cues to dictate decisions whereas System 2 is based in logic and reason. For example, deciding on where to live based on how the new home feels would be a System 1 decision, whereas deciding on a home based on the property value and personal savings would be a System 2 decision. Sympathy acts in a way that provides a means of understanding another person's experience or situation, good or bad, with a focus on their individual well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Arthur J.|title=Empathy and Sympathy: Therapeutic Distinctions in Counseling|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=95–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often easier to make decisions based on emotional information, because all humans have general understanding of emotions. It is this understanding of emotions that allows people to use sympathy to make their decisions.

Sympathy also helps to motivate philanthropic, or aid-giving, behavior (i.e. donations, community service). The choice to donate, and the subsequent decision of how much to give, can be separated into two, different emotion-driven decision making processes. Mood management, or how people act to maintain their moods, influences the initial decision to donate because of selfish concerns (to avoid regret or feel better). However, how a person feels about the deservingness of the recipient determined ''how much'' to donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dickert|first=Stephan |author2=Sagara, Namika |author3=Slovic, Paul|title=Affective motivations to help others: A two-stage model of donation decisions|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date=1 October 2011|volume=24|issue=4|pages=361–376|doi=10.1002/bdm.697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human sympathy in donation behavior can influence the amount of aid given to people and regions that are in need. Increasing how emotional a description is, presenting individual cases instead of large groups, and using less information and numerical information can positively influence giving behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small|first=Deborah A. |author2=Loewenstein, George |author3=Slovic, Paul|title=Sympathy and callousness: The impact of deliberative thought on donations to identifiable and statistical victims|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|year=2007|volume=102|issue=2|pages=143–153|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its influence on decision-making, sympathy also plays a role in maintaining social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irwin|first=K.|author2=Mcgrimmon, T. |author3=Simpson, B. |title=Sympathy and Social Order|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=1 December 2008|volume=71|issue=4|pages=379–397|doi=10.1177/019027250807100406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judging people's character helps to maintain social order, making sure that those who are in need receive the appropriate care. The notion of interdependence fuels sympathetic behavior; this action is seen as self-satisfying because helping someone who is connected to you through some way (family, social capital) will often result in a personal reward (social, monetary, etc.). Regardless of selflessness or selfishness, sympathy facilitates the cycle of give and take that is necessary for maintaining a functional society.

==Healthcare==
Sympathy can also impact the way doctors, nurses, and other members of society think about and treat people with different diseases and conditions. Sympathetic tendencies within the health field fall disproportionately based on patient characteristics and disease type.&lt;ref name="Etchegary 65–84"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etchegary|first=Holly|title=Stigma and Genetic Risk: Perceptions of Stigma among Those at Risk for Huntington Disease (HD)∗|journal=Qualitative Research in Psychology|date=7 August 2007|volume=4|issue=1-2|pages=65–84|doi=10.1080/14780880701473417}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One factor that is frequently considered when determining sympathy is controllability, or the degree to which an individual could have avoided contracting the disease or medical condition. People devote less sympathy to individuals who had control during the event when they acquired HIV.&lt;ref name="Norman 1032–1039"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norman|first=L. R.|author2=Carr, R. |author3=Uche, C. |title=The role of sympathy on avoidance intention toward persons living with HIV/AIDS in Jamaica|journal=AIDS Care|date=1 November 2006|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1032–1039|doi=10.1080/09540120600578409}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even less sympathy is granted to individuals who have control over the means by which they contracted HIV, such as individuals who engage in prostitution.

Sympathy in health-related decision making is heavily based on disease stigma. Disease stigma can lead to discrimination in the work place and in insurance coverage.&lt;ref name="Etchegary 65–84"/&gt; High levels of stigma are also associated with social hostility. Several factors contribute to the development of negative disease stigmas, including the disease's time course, severity, and the dangers that the disease might pose to others. Sexual orientation of individual patients has also been shown to affect stigma levels in the case of HIV diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skelton|first=J. A.|title=How Negative Are Attitudes Toward Persons With SAKIDESL–TLOENUKEMIA PARADIGM AIDS? Examining the AIDS–Leukemia Paradigm|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=28|issue=3|pages=251–261|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp2803_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sympathy is generally associated with low levels of disease stigmatization.

Sympathy is related to increased levels of knowledge regarding HIV and a lower likelihood of avoiding individuals with HIV.&lt;ref name="Norman 1032–1039"/&gt;

==Neuroscience perspectives==
[[File:User-FastFission-brain.gif|thumb|right|alt=A succession of brain scan images|Sympathy is being studied with new technology.]]

Social and emotional stimuli, particularly those related to the well-being of another person, are being more directly studied with advent of technology that can track brain activity (such as [[Electroencephalogram]]s and [[functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging]]). [[Amygdala]] and insula activation occur when a person experiences emotions, such as fear and disgust respectively.&lt;ref name='Decety'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Decety|first=Jean|author2=Michalska, Kalina J. |title=Neurodevelopmental changes in the circuits underlying empathy and sympathy from childhood to adulthood|journal=Developmental Science|date=1 November 2010|volume=13|issue=6|pages=886–899|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00940.x|pmid=20977559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary motor regions are also activated during sympathy. This could be caused by humans' reaction to emotional faces, reflecting the expressions on their own faces, which seems to help people better understand the other person's emotion. In addition, researchers have also suggested that the neural mechanisms that are activated when personally experiencing emotions are also activated when viewing another person experiencing the same emotions ([[mirror neurons]]).&lt;ref name="Singer 81–96"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singer|first=Tania|author2=Lamm, Claus |title=The Social Neuroscience of Empathy|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=1 March 2009|volume=1156|issue=1|pages=81–96|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04418.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain seems to specifically activate a region known as the cingulate cortex,{{mcn|date=August 2016}} in addition to activation that is mentioned earlier.  The temporal parietal junction, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral striatum are also thought to play a role in the production of emotion.{{mcn|date=August 2016}}

Generally, empathic emotions (including sympathy), require the activation of top-down and bottom-up activity. Top-down activity refers to cognitive processes that originate from the frontal lobe and require conscious thought whereas bottom-up activity begins from sensation of stimuli in the environment. From the sensory level, people must sense and experience the emotional cues of another. At the same time, indicative of the dual-process theory, top-down responses must be enacted to make sense of the emotional inputs streaming in and apply motive and environmental influence analyses to better understand the situation. Top-down processes often include attention to emotion and emotion regulation.&lt;ref name="Singer 81–96"/&gt;

==Child development==
[[File:Baby yelling.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|A baby will often cry at the sound of another baby's cries.]]

Sympathy is a stepping stone in both social and moral development. It generally arises between 2–3 years old, although some instances of empathic emotion can be seen as early as 18 months. Basic sharing of emotions, a precursor for sympathy, can be seen in infants. For example, babies will often begin to cry when they hear another baby crying nearby.&lt;ref name="Decety 2010 886–899"/&gt; This emphasizes the infant's ability to recognize emotional cues in his or her environment, even if not able to fully comprehend the emotion. Another milestone in child rearing is the development of the ability to mimic facial expressions. Both of these processes act on sensory and perceptual pathways, yet executive functioning for empathic emotions does not begin during these early stages. Decety and Michalska (2010) believe that early affective development and later development of executive functions create a disparity between how children and young adults experience another person's pain. Young children tend to be negatively aroused more often in comparison to the older subjects.&lt;ref name='Decety'/&gt;

Sympathy can lead to, and be the cause of [[prosocial]] and [[altruistic]] behaviour. Altruistic behaviour is when people who experience emotional reactions consistent with the state of another person and feel "other-oriented" (inclined to help other people in need or distressed.)
People are more inclined to help those in need when they cannot easily escape the situation. If leaving is easy, an individual is likely to reduce one's own distress (of sympathy; feeling bad) by avoiding contact with the other(s) in need. Sympathy is still experienced when it is easy to escape the situation, showing that humans are "other oriented" and altruistic.&lt;ref name="Nancy Eisenberg 1989"&gt;Nancy Eisenberg, R. A. (1989). Relation of Sympathy and Personal Distress to Prosocial Behavior: A Multimethod Study. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 55-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to acknowledge that the use or acceptance of sympathy can be both altruistic and self-satisfying in social situations. Parenting styles (specifically level of affection) can influence the development of sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wispé|first=Lauren|title=The distinction between sympathy and empathy: To call forth a concept, a word is needed.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1986|volume=50|issue=2|pages=314–321|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.2.314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosocial and moral development extends into adolescence and early adulthood as humans learn to better assess and interpret the emotions of others. Prosocial behaviours have been observed in children 1–2 years old. Through self-report methods it is difficult to measure emotional responses as they are not as able to report these responses as well as adult.&lt;ref name="Nancy Eisenberg 1989"/&gt; This is representative of an increased efficiency of and ability to engage in internal moral reasoning.

===Theory of mind===
The development of [[theory of mind]], or the ability to view the world from perspectives of other people, is strongly associated with the development of sympathy and other complex emotions.&lt;ref name="Decety 2010 886–899"/&gt; These emotions are complex because they involve more than just one's own emotional states; complex emotions involve the interplay of multiple people's varying and fluctuating thoughts and emotions within given contexts. The ability to experience vicarious emotion, or imagining how another person feels, is integral for empathic concern. Moral development is similarly tied to the understanding of outside perspectives and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weele|first=Cor|title=Empathy's purity, sympathy's complexities; De Waal, Darwin and Adam Smith|journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy|year=2011|volume=26|issue=4|pages=583–593|doi=10.1007/s10539-011-9248-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral reasoning has been divided into five categories beginning with a hedonistic self-orientation and ending with an internalized sense of needs of others, including empathic emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=Nancy |author2=Carlo, Gustavo |author3=Murphy, Bridget |author4=Court, Patricia|title=Prosocial Development in Late Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study|journal=Child Development|date=1 August 1995|volume=66|issue=4|pages=1179–1197|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1995.tb00930.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innate feature===
A study conducted in Switzerland in 2006 sought to find whether or not sympathy demonstrated by children was solely for personal benefit, or if the emotion was an innate part of development. Parents, teachers, and 1,300 children (aged 6 and 7) were interviewed regarding the child's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Buchmann, Marlis, Michaela Gummerum, Monika Keller, and Tina Malti. "Child's Moral Motivation, Sympathy, and Prosocial Behaviour." Child Development 80.2 Apr. (2009): 442-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of one year, questionnaires were filled out regarding the progress and behavior of each youth. Thereafter, an interview was conducted in the spring of 2007. The study concluded that children do develop sympathy and empathy independently of parental guidance. Furthermore, the study found that girls are more sympathetic, prosocial, and morally motivated than boys. [[Prosocial behavior]] has been noted in children as young as 12 months when showing and giving toys to their parents, without promoting or being reinforced by praise. Levels of prosocial behavior increased with sympathy in children with low moral motivation, as it reflects the link between innate abilities and honing them with the guidance of parents and teachers.

'''The road to hell is paved with good intentions''' is a [[proverb]] or [[aphorism]]. An alternative form is "'''Hell is full of good meanings, but heaven is full of good works'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Proverbs |page=234 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=9780816066735 |chapter=the road to Hell is paved with good intentions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The saying is thought to have originated with [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard of Clairvaux]] who wrote ({{circa}} 1150), "''L'enfer est plein de bonnes volontés ou désirs''" (hell is full of good wishes or desires).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9re1vfFh04sC&amp;pg=PA542 |title=The American Heritage dictionary of idioms |first1=Christine |last1=Ammer |isbn=9780395727744 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An earlier saying occurs in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'': "''facilis descensus Averno'' (the descent to hell is easy)".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Analogous Proverbs In Ten Languages |chapter=Hell is paved with good intentions |first1=Mrs E. B. |last1=Mawr |year=1885 |publisher=Elliot Stock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
A common interpretation of the saying is that wrongdoings or evil actions are often masked by good intentions; or even that good intentions, when acted upon, may have [[unintended consequences]]. A simple example is the introduction of an [[invasive species]], like the [[Asian carp]], which has become a nuisance due to unexpected proliferation and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/psychological-solution-bullying/201008/principle-number-one-the-road-hell-is-paved-good-intenti |journal=Psychology Today |series=Resilience to Bullying |first1=Izzy |last1=Kalman |title=Principle Number One: The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions |date=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meaning of the phrase is that individuals may have the intention to undertake good actions but nevertheless fail to take action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/the+road+to+hell+is+paved+with+good+intentions |title=The road to hell is paved with good intentions |publisher=Dictionary.com/[[Houghton Mifflin Company]] |work=The American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy |edition=Third  |year=2005 |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/the-road-to-hell-is-paved-with-good-intentions |title=The road to hell is paved with good intentions |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org/[[Cambridge University Press]] |work=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus |edition=Third |year=2008 |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inaction may be due to [[procrastination]], [[laziness]] or other subversive vice.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGiREb_p238C&amp;pg=PA33 |title=101 American English proverbs: understanding language and culture through commonly used sayings |first1=Harry |last1=Collis |first2=Mario |last2=Risso |chapter=The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions |isbn=9780844254128 |year=1992 |location=Lincolnwood, Ill |publisher=Passport Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the saying is an admonishment that a good intention is meaningless unless followed through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychosocial Basis of Health Care |first1=Charles L., editor |last1=Bowden |first2=Alvin George, editor |last2=Burstein |page=98 |publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins |year=1983 |isbn=0-683-00993-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral certainty can be used to justify the harm done by failing policies and actions. Those with good intentions believe their practices are good for the group; it is self-evident to them. They justify [[collateral damage]] in the belief they do a greater good. The [[Nazi concentration camps]] were created to hold so-called "racially undesirable elements" of German society. The [[GULAG]] system was introduced in order to isolate disloyal elements not contributing to the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. The [[Inquisition]] was established to eradicate [[heretics]] in religious states. The harm done is clearly seen, and acknowledged, but is written off as a 'price worth paying'.

On a personal level, taking a subjectively "good action" can land one in a horrific emotional and/or physical state of being, e.g., a soldier goes off to war to fight for the subjective good of their country and ends up with  [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

==Studies==
[[Psychology|Psychological]] studies of the effect of intention upon task completion by professors [[Peter Gollwitzer]], Paschal Sheeran and Sheina Orbell indicate that there is some truth in the proverb.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |volume=38 |first1=Peter |last1=Gollwitzer |first2=Paschal |last2=Sheeran |chapter=Implementation intentions and goal achievement |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Qhwr7jGyFsC&amp;pg=PA70 |isbn=9780120152384 |date=2006-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Perfectionism (psychology)|Perfectionists]] are especially prone to having their [[Implementation intention|intention]]s backfire in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Implementation Intentions, Perfectionism, and Goal Progress: Perhaps the Road to Hell Is Paved With Good Intentions |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=31 |pages=902&amp;ndash;912 |year=2005 |doi=10.1177/0146167204272311 |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/31/7/902 |issue=7 |last1=Powers |first1=T.

Attempts to improve the [[ethics|ethical]] behaviour of groups are often counter-productive.  If legislation is used for such an attempt, people observe the [[letter of the law]] rather than improve the desired behaviour.  During [[negotiation]], groups that are encouraged to understand the [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]] of the other parties are worse at this than those whose [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] is not enlightened.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  The threat of [[punishment]] may make behavior less rather than more ethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cEu7eyQEZPcC&amp;pg=PA273 |title=Ethics in groups |volume=8 |chapter=The Road to Hell |first1=David |last1=Messick |pages=273–274 |isbn=9780762313006 |date=2006-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies of [[business ethics]] indicate that most wrongdoing is not due directly to wickedness but is performed by people who did not plan to err.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV9wdAJWyG4C&amp;pg=PA11 |title=Good intentions aside: a manager's guide to resolving ethical problems |first1=Laura L. |last1=Nash |isbn=9780875844299 |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen G. Post|Stephen Garrard Post]], writing about [[altruism]], suggests that good intentions are often not what they seem and that mankind normally acts from less worthy, selfish motives&amp;mdash;"If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, it is partly because that is the road they generally start out on."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Altruism &amp; altruistic love |first1=Stephen Garrard |last1=Post |page=203 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |isbn=9780195143584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Time-out''' is a form of behavioral modification that involves temporarily separating a person from an environment where unacceptable behavior has occurred. The goal is to remove that person from an enriched, enjoyable environment, and therefore lead to [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]] of the offending behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 23881717|title = Is Isolation Room Time-Out a Punisher?|journal = Behavioral Disorders|volume = 6|issue = 4|pages = 247–256|last1 = Smith|first1 = Donald E. P|year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an educational and [[parenting]] technique recommended by most [[pediatrician]]s and [[developmental psychologist]]s as an effective form of [[discipline]]. Often a corner (hence the common term ''corner time'') or a similar space where the person is to stand or sit during time-outs is designated. This form of discipline is especially popular in western cultures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Invitation to the Life Span|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publisher|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the punishment is often known as the '''naughty chair''' or '''naughty step'''. This term became popular in the US thanks to two reality TV series, ''[[Supernanny]]'' and ''[[Nanny 911]]''.

==History==
The concept of time-out was invented,{{dubious|reason=what chance is there that there have been fewer than thousands (at the very least, and perhaps millions) of prior independent inventions of the core practice?|date=October 2018}} named, and used (see Child Magazine, 2006, "20 People who Changed Childhood"&lt;ref name="20 People Who Changed Childhood"&gt;{{cite article|title= 20 People Who Changed Childhood|author=R. Straus|date=October 2006|pages=107–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) by [[Arthur W. Staats]] in his extended work with his daughter (and later son), and was part of a long-term program of behavioral analysis beginning in 1958 that treated various aspects of child development. He introduced various elements that later composed foundations for applied behavior analysis and behavior therapy. (The [[token reward system]] was another invention by him.) [[Montrose Wolf]], a graduate student assistant of Staats on several studies dealing with reading learning in preschoolers (see, for example, "The conditioning of textual responses using 'extrinsic' reinforcers"&lt;ref name=" The conditioning of textual responses using 'extrinsic' reinforcers"&gt;{{cite article|title= The conditioning of textual responses using 'extrinsic' reinforcers|author=Staats, A.W.; Staats, C.K.; Schultz, R.E.; Wolf, M.|date=1962|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;), used that background when he went to the [[University of Washington]] where he began his creative program of research. Wolf began the widespread use of Staats' time-out procedure in extending training methods to an autistic child (see the 1964 published study dealing with the behavioral treatment of a child).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=1226164 | pmid=16033175 | doi=10.1901/jaba.2005.165-04 | volume=38 | issue=2 | title=Montrose M. Wolf (1935-2004) | year=2005 | journal=J Appl Behav Anal | pages=279–87 | last1 = Risley | first1 = T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1404175&amp;blobtype=pdf | pmc = 1404175 | pmid=13916029 | doi=10.1901/jeab.1962.5-33 | volume=5 | title=The conditioning of textual responses using &amp;quot;extrinsic&amp;quot; reinforcers | year=1962 | journal=J Exp Anal Behav | pages=33–40 | last1 = Staats | first1 = AW | last2 = Staats | first2 = CK | last3 = Schutz | first3 = RE | last4 = Wolf | first4 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staats described the discipline of his 2-year-old daughter in 1962: "I would put her in her crib and indicate that she had to stay there until she stopped crying. If we were in a public place [where her behavior was inappropriate], I would pick her up and go outside."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Strauss, "Twenty People Who Changed Childhood," ''Child'' magazine, October 2006, pp107-110.&lt;/ref&gt; .

== Application ==
For Staats, the timeout period was ended when the child's misbehavior, such as crying inappropriately, ended. He considered removal from a positive emotional environment to one of lesser positivity as a very mild punishment. Various people have added their opinions regarding time-out as the following indicates.

Time out is a type two [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment procedure]] and is used commonly in schools, colleges, offices, clinics and homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wolf | first1 = Tera L. | last2 = McLaughlin | first2 = T. F. | last3 = Lee Williams | first3 = Randy | year = 2006 | title = Time-out interventions and strategies: A brief review and recommendations | url = | journal = International Journal of Special Education | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 22–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To implement time out, a caregiver removes the child from a reinforcing activity for a short period of time, usually 5 to 15 minutes, in order to discourage inappropriate behavior and teach the child that engaging in problem behavior will result in decreased access to reinforcing items and events in the child's environment.

Time-outs may be on a chair, step, corner, bedroom, or any other location where there are no distractions and reduced access to fun items, activities and people.  This procedure is preferable to other punishments such as reprimanding, yelling at or spanking the child for their misbehavior, which are type one punishments ([[positive punishment]]).

Research has established that 15 minutes is the maximum time that a child should be kept in time out from reinforcers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = G. D. | last2 = Nielsen | first2 = G. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = S. M. | year = 1972 | title = TIMEOUT DURATION AND THE SUPPRESSION OF DEVIANT BEHAVIOR IN CHILDREN1 | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 111–120 | doi=10.1901/jaba.1972.5-111| pmc = 1310739 | pmid=16795328}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, shorter durations may be just as effective for behavior change.

For this disciplinary technique to be most effective and to produce the desired results, the child should be old enough to sit still and is required to remain there for a fixed period. Also, according to developmental psychologists, parents should evaluate each situation to determine what may be causing the misbehavior, such as a toy, frustration, hunger, or lack of sleep, and then address any underlying needs before a punishment contingency should be used. Any time they are trying to reduce a problem behavior, parents should be sure that they are also teaching and reinforcing the desired replacement behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Discipline and Effective Parenting|last = Flaskerud|first = Jacquelyn H.|date = 2011|journal = Issues in Mental Health Nursing|accessdate = |doi = 10.3109/01612840.2010.498078|pmid =21208055|volume=32|issue = 1|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents should also clearly explain why the child is being put in time out, and what the child needs to do to return to the reinforcing environment/be let out of time-out (but too much explanation can reinforce the unwanted behavior as a result of "misplaced adult attention"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200109/why-our-kids-are-out-control ''Psychology Today'' September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;). Furthermore, the renown developmental psychologist Kathleen Stassen Berger suggests that time-out should remain brief, proposing a general guideline: the length of time that the child should remain in time-out should correlate with the child's age - each of year of the child's age constitutes one minute in time-out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Time-out is one behavior control method based on removing [[positive reinforcement]] for a brief time.  Less elaborate methods from the same class like [[tactical ignoring]], or planned ignoring, also can be effective in cases where parental/caregiver attention is the positive reinforcement for negative behavior. This class of methods are more effective if the child gets a significant amount positive reinforcement (praise, attention) for good behavior. All punishment procedures can evoke other problem behaviors, damage rapport, or evoke escape or avoidant behaviors. For this, and other ethical reasons, behavior analysts exhaust all options for using differential reinforcement and/or [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] procedures to reduce problem behavior, before considering the use of punishment procedures.

==Effectiveness==
Several studies show that time-out is an especially effective disciplinary strategy, reducing aggressive and non-compliant behavior, when other positive parenting methods are also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Parental Use of Time Out Revisited: A Useful or Harmful Parenting Strategy?|last = Morawska|first = Alina|date = February 2011|journal = Journal of Child and Family Studies|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Time out must be linked with "time in" in order to be effective because children need to be able to find reinforcement through positive experiences.

There are differences between strategies for ending time out. While some proponents of time-outs insist on silence and stillness from the child during the time-out, it is easier to use a "release-contingency," such that the requirement is only that the child is sitting peacefully at the end of the time-out period. Those who use time-out for children to get anger and frustration "out of their system" or for children to think about their behavior are using time-out in a way that is different than those basing it on operant behavioral principles (that time-out from positive reinforcement may reduce recurrences of the unwanted target behavior).

In a study by Donaldson and Vollmer, the efficacy of a fixed duration time-out and a release contingency time-out were compared. In the fixed duration condition, children were sent to time-out for a total of 4 minutes and were released from time-out whether or not they performed problem behavior during the time-out session. In the release contingency condition, children were not released from time-out if they were performing problem behavior during the last 30 seconds of their time-out. The time-out was extended until there were no occurrences of problem behavior for a total of 30 seconds or until the time-out reached the ten-minute mark. Results showed that both time-out procedures were successful in reducing the problem behavior for the subjects. The subjects in the release contingency did not benefit from staying in time-out for an extended period of time either. Moreover, the results show that only 4 minutes is necessary for a successful time-out procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donaldson | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Vollmer | first2 = T. R. | year = 2011 | title = An evaluation and comparison of time-out procedures with and without release contingencies | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 693–705 | doi=10.1901/jaba.2011.44-693 | pmid=22219523 | pmc=3251275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of time-out also varies with each individual child, dependent on the child's age, temperament and emotional wellness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Critics of time-out include [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]], [[Gabor Maté (physician)|Gabor Mate]], [[Alfie Kohn]] and [[Aletha Solter]], who claim that the approach may lead to short-term compliance but has the same disadvantages as other forms of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, T. (2000). Parent Effectiveness Training: The Proven Program for Raising Responsible Children. New York, NY: Three Rivers Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (2005). Unconditional Parenting: Moving From Rewards and Punishments to Love and Reason. New York, NY: Atria Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (1989). Helping Young Children Flourish. Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (2013). Attachment Play. Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (2002). The disadvantages of time-out. http://www.awareparenting.com/timeout.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seasoned teachers say 'Time-outs only seem to work at first because of shock value and over time it becomes less effective.' http://afineparent.com/be-positive/effective-discipline.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to these authors, the use of time-out does not enhance moral behavior or teach children useful conflict-resolution skills and it fails to address the underlying cause of the behavior. Furthermore, they claim that the parent/child bond can be damaged by forced isolation and withdrawal of love in an effort to control a child's behavior and this can lead to feelings of insecurity or anxiety in children, though there is no evidence that this occurs. Another argument is that time-out, like all other methods of [[coercive control]], eventually stops working as children grow older and begin to rebel against their parents’ authoritarian approach to discipline.

In addition to the potential psychological drawbacks resulting from the use of time-out, there also appears to be a risk to the child's developing brain, according to research in neuroscience by [[Daniel J. Siegel]]. “In a brain scan, relational pain (that caused by isolation during punishment) can look the same as physical abuse,” and “Repeated experiences actually change the physical structure of the brain.”&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, D.J. and Bryson, T.P. (September 23, 2014). ‘Time-Outs’ Are Hurting Your Child. Time Magazine online. http://time.com/3404701/discipline-time-out-is-not-good/&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dr. Siegel backed away from this statement and claimed that Time Magazine distorted his message. He later clarified, "The “appropriate” use of time-outs calls for brief, infrequent, previously explained breaks from an interaction used as part of a thought-out parenting strategy that is followed by positive feedback and connection with a parent. This seems not only reasonable, but it is an overall approach supported by the research as helpful for many children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drdansiegel.com/blog/2014/10/29/you-said-what-about-time-outs/|title=You Said WHAT About Time-Outs?! {{!}} Dr. Dan Siegel|website=www.drdansiegel.com|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Association for Infant Mental Health has published a position statement in which the use of time-out is considered inappropriate, especially for children under three years of age, which matches with most professional advice.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Association for Infant Mental Health (July 2009): Position Pager 3: Time Out. {{cite web |url=http://www.aaimhi.org/inewsfiles/Position%20Paper%203.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908074504/http://www.aaimhi.org/inewsfiles/Position%20Paper%203.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of time-out needs to be carefully considered in families dealing with special challenges. In a review of parenting intervention programs for drug-abusing mothers, researchers found that programs emphasizing behavioral approaches to discipline (such as the use of time-out and rewards) “were not successful in fostering measurable improvement in mother-child interactions or promoting child development.” An attachment-based approach focusing on strengthening the parent/child relationship was found to be more successful than behavioral approaches in changing children's behavior in these families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suchman | first1 =  | last2 = Pajulo | first2 = M. | last3 = DeCoste | first3 = C. | last4 = Mayes | first4 = L.C. | year = 2006 | title = Parenting Interventions for Drug-Dependent Mothers and Their Young Children: The Case for an Attachment-Based Approach | journal = Family Relations | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 211–226 | pmc=1847954 | pmid=17417669 | doi=10.1111/j.1741-3729.2006.00371.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found that the traditional behavioral approach to discipline (such as the use of time-out and rewards) can be challenging with children in foster care with attachment disorders resulting from early abuse or neglect. Foster parents benefit from training that addresses these children's attachment and emotional issues, as wells as traditional parenting techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wotherspoon | first1 = E. | last2 = O'Neill-Laberge | first2 = M. | last3 = Pirie | first3 = J. | year = 2008 | title = Meeting the emotional needs of infants and toddlers in foster care: the collaborative mental health care experience | url = | journal = Infant Mental Health Journal | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 377–397 | doi = 10.1002/imhj.20185 | pmid = 28636157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Time-out has been misused to the point of becoming abusive in some schools and so proper training for educational professionals is important. There are reported cases of children being locked in closets for extended periods of solitary confinement for behaviors such as crying or failing to finish an assignment.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, I. (1990). Child abusers' destructive use of 'time-out'. From Reading, Writing and the Hickory Stick, pp. 139-140, 12-13. http://www.nospank.net/timeout.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some experts call school time-out rooms 'abuse.' http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2008-10-20-time-out-discipline_N.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These are not examples of appropriate use of time-out.

These three worlds are identified in [[Hinduism]] and appear in early [[Buddhist texts]].

== In Buddhist cosmology ==
{{Main|Buddhist cosmology}}
In [[Buddhism]], the three worlds refer the following destinations for [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|karmic rebirth]]:
* Kāmaloka is the world of desire, typified by base desires, populated by [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell beings]], [[preta]], animals, ghosts, humans and lower demi-gods.
* Rūpaloka is the world of form, predominately free of baser desires, populated by [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]-dwelling gods, possible rebirth destination for those well practiced in dhyāna.
* Arūpaloka is the world of formlessness, a noncorporeal realm populated with four heavens, possible rebirth destination for practitioners of the four formlessness stages.&lt;ref name="fischer-schreiber" /&gt;

== Theosophical views==
According to [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s posthumously published ''Theosophical Glossary'' (1892):
* [[Kamaloka]] (or ''kamadhatu'') is the world of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]. Kamaloka has, like every other world, its seven divisions, the lowest of which begins on earth or invisibly in its atmosphere; the six others ascend gradually, the highest being the abode of those who have died owing to [[accident]], or [[suicide]] in a fit of temporary [[insanity]], or were otherwise victims of external forces. It is a place where all those who have died before the end of the term allotted to them, and whose higher principles do not, therefore, go at once into [[Devachan]]ic state—sleep a dreamless sweet sleep of oblivion, at the termination of which they are either reborn immediately, or pass gradually into the Devachanic state.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* Rupaloka (or ''rupadhatu'') is the celestial world of "form" (''rupa''), or what we call "Devachan." With the uninitiated Brahmans, Chinese and other Buddhists, the Rupadhatu is divided into eighteen Brahma or Devalokas; the life of a soul therein lasts from half a [[Yuga]] up to 16,000 Yugas or [[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpas]], and the height of the "Shades" is from half a [[Yojana]] up to 16,000 Yojanas (where a Yojana measures from five and a half to ten miles). Esoteric Philosophy teaches that though for the Egos for the time being, everything or everyone preserves its form (as in a dream), yet as Rupadhatu is a purely matter world, and a state, the Egos themselves have no form outside their own consciousness. Esotericism divides this world into seven [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|Dhyanas]], "regions", or states of contemplation, which are not localities but mental representations of these.
* Arupaloka (or ''arupadhatu'') is a world that is again divided into seven Dhyanas, still more abstract and formless, for this "World" is without any form or [[tanha|desire]] whatever. It is the highest world of the post-mortem Trailokya; and as it is the abode of those who are almost ready for [[Nirvana]], and is, in fact, the very threshold of the Nirvanic state, it stands to reason that in Anupadhatu (or Arupavachara) there can be neither form nor sensation, nor any feeling connected with our three-dimensional [[Universe]].&lt;ref name="blavatsky_glossary" /&gt;

== Hindu surname==
Trailokya is also a [[Hindu]] [[surname]], mostly belonging to the [[Daivadnya Brahmin]], a Hindu [[Brahmin]] [[sub-caste]].{{relevance inline|reason=And ''Wolf'' is also a surname, but do we add that to the article on wolves?}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25907">A '''war of annihilation''' ({{lang-de|Vernichtungskrieg|links=no}}) is a type of [[warfare]] in which the goal is the complete annihilation of a state, a people or an ethnic minority through [[genocide]] or through the destruction of their livelihood. The goal can be outward-directed or inward, against elements of one's own population. The goal is not like other types of warfare, the recognition of limited political goals, such as recognition of a legal status (such as in a [[war of independence]]), control of disputed territory (as in [[war of aggression]] or [[defensive war]]), or the 
total military defeat ([[debellatio]]) of an enemy state.
 
== Features ==
War of annihilation is defined as a radicalized form of [[warfare]] in which "all psycho-physical limits" are abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sven Lindqvist]]: ''Durch das Herz der Finsternis. Ein Afrika-Reisender auf den Spuren des europäischen Völkermords'', Unionsverlag, Zürich 1999, S. 62; Susanne Kuß, Bernd Martin: ''Das Deutsche Reich und der Boxeraufstand''. Iudicium, München 2002, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hamburg social scientist [[Jan Philipp Reemtsma]] sees a war, "which is led, in the worst case, to destroy or even decimate a population", as the heart of the war of annihilation.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Philipp Reemtsma: ''Die Idee des Vernichtungskrieges. Clausewitz – Ludendorff – Hitler''. In: [[Hannes Heer]], [[Klaus Naumann (historian)|Klaus Naumann]] (Eds.): ''Vernichtungskrieg. Verbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941–1944''. Hamburg 1995, pp. 377–401, hier S. 377, vgl. auch 386–398.&lt;/ref&gt;
The state organization of the enemy will be smashed. Another characteristic of a war of annihilation is its ideological character and the rejection of negotiations with the enemy, as the historian Andreas Hillgruber [[Andreas Hillgruber]] has shown in the example of the 1941 [[Operation Barbarossa]] against [[Jewish Bolshevism]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Hillgruber: ''Die ideologisch-dogmatische Grundlage der nationalsozialistischen Politik der Ausrottung der Juden in den besetzten Gebieten der Sowjetunion und ihre Durchführung 1941–1944''. In: German Studies Review 2 (1979), Bd. 3, p. 263–296.&lt;/ref&gt; The legitimacy and trustworthiness of the opponent is negated, demoted to status of a total enemy, with whom there can be no understanding, but rather devotes the totality of one's own ''"Volk, Krieg und Politik [als] Triumph der Idee des Vernichtungskrieges"'' (people, war and politics [to the] triumph of the idea of the war of annihilation).&lt;ref&gt;Jan Philipp Reemtsma: ''Die Idee des Vernichtungskrieges. Clausewitz – Ludendorff – Hitler'', pp. 386–398, Zitat p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
=== War of extermination ===
The term "war of extermination" was used in many American wars with [[Amerindian]]s, most notably California governor [[Peter Burnett]]'s prediction of one during the [[California Genocide]]:

{{cquote|That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected. While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert.|||—From California governor Peter Hardeman Burnett's Second Annual Message to the Legislature, January 7, 1851:&lt;ref&gt;"The Governor's Message (Transmitted January 7, 1851)," Sacramento Transcript, 10 January 1851, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On January 6, 1851 at his State of the State address to the California Senate, 1st Governor Peter Burnett used the following words: "That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct must be expected. While we cannot anticipate this result but with painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power or wisdom of man to avert."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Brenden C (2012). "Murder State: California's Native American Genocide, 1846–1873." University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln and London. p.231&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Herero uprising ===
[[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] political communications had circulated the term ''Vernichtungskrieg'' in order to criticize the action against the insurgents during the [[Herero Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank Oliver Sobich: ''„Schwarze Bestien, rote Gefahr“. Rassismus und Antisozialismus im deutschen Kaiserreich''. Campus, Frankfurt am Main 2006, S. 301–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1904 the [[Herero and Namaqua genocide]] began in the German colony [[German South West Africa]]. With a total of about 15,000 men under Lieutenant General [[Lothar von Trotha]], this uprising was prostrated until August 1904. Most of the Herero fled to the almost waterless [[Omaheke]], an offshoot of the [[Kalahari Desert]]. From Trotha had them locked down and the refugees chased away from the few water spots there, so that thousands of Herero along with their families and cattle herds thirst. The hunted in the desert, let Trotha in the so-called ''Vernichtungsbefehl'', "Annihilation Command":

{{quote|''Die Herero sind nicht mehr Deutsche Untertanen. […] Innerhalb der Deutschen Grenze wird jeder Herero mit oder ohne Gewehr, mit oder ohne Vieh erschossen, ich nehme keine Weiber und keine Kinder mehr auf, treibe sie zu ihrem Volke zurück oder lasse auch auf sie schießen.''

The Herero are no longer German subjects. [...] Within the German border, every Herero is shot with or without a rifle, with or without cattle, I take no more wives and no children, I drive them back to their people or let them be shot.|ref=Gewald&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Bart Gewald: ''The Great General of the Kaiser'', in: ''Botswana Notes and Records.'' Band 26, S. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Trotha's warfare aimed at the complete annihilation of the Herero ("I believe that the nation must be destroyed as such"&lt;ref&gt;Brief an Generalstabschef [[Alfred Graf von Schlieffen]], 5. Oktober 1904, in: Michael Behnen: ''Quellen zur deutschen Aussenpolitik im Zeitalter des Imperialismus 1890–1911.'' Darmstadt 1977, S. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;) and was supported in particular by Schlieffen and [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]].&lt;ref name="schaller"&gt;Dominik J. Schaller: ''»Ich glaube, dass die Nation als solche vernichtet werden muss: Kolonialkrieg und Völkermord in «Deutsch-Südwestafrika» 1904–1907«.'' In: ''Journal of Genocide Research.'' 6:3, S. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; His approach is therefore considered to be the first [[genocide]] of the twentieth century. Trotha's action sparked outrage in Germany and abroad; at the instigation of chancellor [[Bernhard von Bülow]], the Emperor lifted the order of annihilation two months after the events in the Omaheke. Trotha's policy remained largely unchanged until its revocation in November 1905.&lt;ref name="schaller" /&gt;

=== Ludendorff's conception ===
The war of annihilation was a further development of the concept of [[Total War]], as 1935 the former imperial [[Generalquartiermeister|General Quartermaster]] [[Erich Ludendorff]] had designed. Thereafter, in a coming war, victory must be given unlimited priority over all other societal concerns: all [[resources]] would have to be harnessed, the will of the nation had to be made available before the outbreak of the hostilities are unified by [[propaganda]] and dictatorship violence, all available weapons would have to be used, and no consideration could be taken of [[International law]]. Even in its objectives, total war is unlimited, as the experience of [[First World War]] teaching:

{{quote|''Ihn führten nicht nur die Wehrmächte der am Kriege beteiligten Staaten, die gegenseitig ihre Vernichtung erstrebten, die Völker selbst wurden in den Dienst der Kriegsführung gestellt, der Krieg richtete sich auch gegen sie selbst und zog sie selbst in tiefste Mitleidenschaft […] Zum Kampf gegen die feindlichen Streitkräfte auf gewaltigen Fronten und weiten Meeren gesellte sich das Ringen gegen die Psyche und Lebenskraft der feindlichen Völker zu dem Zweck, sie zu zersetzen und zu lähmen.''

They not only led the armed forces of the states involved in the war, who aspired to annihilate each other; the peoples themselves were put in the service of warfare; the war was also directed against them and pulled them into deepest passion [...] Fighting against the enemy forces on huge fronts and wide seas, the struggle against the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and [[Vitality|life force]] of the hostile peoples was joined with the purpose of depressing and paralyzing them.
|ref=Ludendorff 1935&lt;ref&gt;Erich Ludendorff: ''Der totale Krieg''. Ludendorffs Verlag, München 1935, S. 4&amp;nbsp;f.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this conceptual delimitation of the war, Ludendorff was able to draw from the German military-theoretical discourse, which had formed in the confrontation with the [[People's War]], the "Guerre à outrance", which the newly created [[Third French Republic]] in the fall and winter of 1870 against the Prussian-German invaders of the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref name="Fowley2001"&gt;Robert T. Foley: ''From Volkskrieg to Vernichtungskrieg. German Concepts of Warfare, 1871–1935.'' In: Anja Hartmann, Beatrice Heuser (Hrsg.): ''War, Peace, and World Orders in European History''. Routledge, London/New York 2001, S. 215–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludendorff also dealt with [[Carl von Clausewitz]] and his 1832 posthumously published work ''[[On War]]'', in which he distinguished between 'absolute' and 'limited' wars. But even for Clausewitz absolute war was subject to restrictions, such as the distinction between combatants and non-combatants, between military and civil or between public and private. Ludendorff claimed now that in total war it is no longer a "petty political purpose", not even "big [...] national interests", but the sheer ''Lebenserhaltung'' (life-support) of the nation, its identity. This existential threat also justifies the annihilation of the enemy, at least moral, if not physical. &lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Janssen: "War". In: [[Reinhart Koselleck]], [[Werner Conze]], [[Otto Brunner (historian) | Otto Brunner]] (eds.): ''Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe: Historisches Lexikon zur politisch-sozialen Sprache in Deutschland''. Historical lexicon on the political-social language in Germany. Vol. 3, Klett-Cotta, Stuttgart 1982, pp. 613.&lt;/ref&gt; Ludendorffs efforts to radicalize the war (for which he was responsible from 1916) met with social, political and military barriers. In the year 1935, his advice was then, as the historian Robert Foley writes, "on fertile ground"; the time seemed ripe for an even more radical delimitation of the war by the [[Nazism|National Socialists]].&lt;ref name="Fowley2001" /&gt;

=== Nazi warfare ===
{{further |Bandenbekämpfung}} 
The best known example of a ''Vernichtungskrieg'' is the [[German-Soviet War]], which began on June 22, 1941 with the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]]. The Berlin historian [[Ernst Nolte]] called this 1963 in a much-quoted formulation as the "most egregious ''Versklavungs- und Vernichtungskrieg'' [war of enslavement and annihilation] known to modern history" and distinguished it from a "normal war", as the Nazi regime conducted against France.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Nolte: ''Der Faschismus in seiner Epoche. Action francaise – Italienischer Faschismus – Nationalsozialismus''. Taschenbuchausgabe, Piper, München 1984, S. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1965 [[habilitation thesis]] ''Hitlers Strategie'' [[Andreas Hillgruber]] worked out the motifs of the Nazi state based on racial ideological basis for the war against the Soviet Union:
#The physical extinction of the "[[Jewish Bolshevism | Judeo-Bolshevik]]" elite of the country and the Jews themselves as their supposed biological root
#The conquest of colonial and ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for the German Reich and
#The subjugation and decimation of the Slavic population.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Hillgruber: ''Hitlers Strategie. Politik und Kriegführung 1940–1941.'' Frankfurt a.&amp;nbsp;M., 2. Auflage 1982, S.&amp;nbsp;519 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Hillgruber explicitly described the character of the Eastern Front as "intended racial-ideological war of annihilation".&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Hillgruber: ''Der Ostkrieg und die Judenvernichtung'', in: Gerd R. Ueberschär u. Wolfram Wette (Hrsg.): ''Der deutsche Überfall auf die Sowjetunion. „Unternehmen Barbarossa“ 1941.'' Fischer Taschenbuch, Frankfurt a.&amp;nbsp;M. 1991, S. 185–206, Zitat S. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Barbarossa has also found its way into the historical-political teaching of general education schools as a historical example of an extermination war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wigbert Benz]]: ''„Unternehmen Barbarossa“ 1941. Vernichtungskrieg und historisch-politische Bildung''. In: Informationen für den Geschichts- und Gemeinschaftskundeunterricht. Heft 60/2010, S. 5–33; [http://87.106.4.207/service/unter/benz_2.htm siehe auch Online-Version].&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the war of annihilation was intensely discussed in the 1990s with reference to the ''[[Wehrmachtsausstellung]]'' of the [[Hamburg Institute for Social Research]], which carried the word "''Vernichtungskrieg''" in the title.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hannes Heer]] u.&amp;nbsp;a. (Hrsg.): ''Verbrechen der Wehrmacht. Dimensionen des Vernichtungskrieges 1941–1944''. Ausstellungskatalog. Hamburger Institut für Sozialforschung. 1. Auflage, [[Hamburger Edition]], Hamburg 1996. Johannes Klotz: ''Die Ausstellung „Vernichtungskrieg, Verbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941 bis 1944“. Zwischen Geschichtswissenschaft und Geschichtspolitik.'' In: Detlef Bald, Johannes Klotz, Wolfram Wette: ''Mythos Wehrmacht. Nachkriegsdebatten und Traditionspflege''. Aufbau, Berlin 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; That Operation Barbarossa would be a war of annihilation, Adolf Hitler had pronounced openly on March 30, 1941 before the generals of the Wehrmacht:

{{quote|''Kampf zweier [[Weltanschauung]]en gegeneinander. Vernichtendes Urteil über Bolschewismus, ist gleich asoziales Verbrechertum. [[Kommunismus]] ungeheure Gefahr für die Zukunft. Wir müssen von dem Standpunkt des soldatischen Kameradentums abrücken. Der Kommunist ist vorher kein Kamerad und nachher kein Kamerad. Es handelt sich um einen Vernichtungskampf. Wenn wir es nicht so auffassen, dann werden wir zwar den Feind schlagen, aber in 30 Jahren wird uns wieder der kommunistische Feind gegenüberstehen. Wir führen nicht Krieg, um den Feind zu konservieren. […] Kampf gegen Rußland: Vernichtung der bolschewistischen Kommissare und der kommunistischen Intelligenz. […] Der Kampf wird sich sehr unterscheiden vom Kampf im Westen. Im Osten ist Härte mild für die Zukunft. Die Führer müssen von sich das Opfer verlangen, ihre Bedenken zu überwinden.'

Fight two [[worldview]]s against each other. Devastating verdict on [[Bolshevism]] is equal to antisocial criminality. [[Communism]] immense danger for the future. We have to move away from the position comradeship between soldiers. The communist is not a comrade before and not a comrade afterwards. It is a battle of annihilation. If we do not take it that way, we will beat the enemy, but in 30 years the Communist enemy will be facing us again. We are not waging war to preserve the enemy. [...] Fight against Russia: destruction of Bolshevik commissioners and Communist intelligence. [...] The fight will be very different from the fight in the West. In the east, hardness is mild for the future. The leaders must ask the victim to overcome their concerns.|ref=Halder 1963&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Halder]]: ''Kriegstagebuch.

The orientation of Operation Barbarossa as a prior planned war of annihilation proves the commands prepared according to the general guidelines cited by Hitler on 30 March 1941 before the start of the campaign, such as the [[Barbarossa Decree]] of 13 May 1941, the Guidelines for the conduct of the troops in Russia of 19 May 1941 and the [[Commissar Order]] of 6 June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rolf-Dieter Müller]], [[Gerd R.

The German guidelines for agricultural policy in the Soviet territories to be conquered are one of the most extreme examples of a robbery and annihilation strategy. In a meeting of the secretaries of State on May 2, 1941, the [[Hunger Plan]] prepared:

The German historian Jochen Böhler regarded the [[Invasion of Poland]] as "prelude to the ''Vernichtungskrieg''" against the Soviet Union 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Jochen Böhler: ''Die Zerstörung der Nachbarschaft.

In journalism and research, many other conflicts are also known as ''Vernichtungskrieg''.

In 1876, the German writer and historian [[Felix Dahn]] used the term for the first time in the modern sense: in his novel ''A struggle for Rome'' he let the Byzantine warlord [[Narses]] aim his campaign against [[Goths]] to Ethnic group in Italy completely utterly, i.e. lead a "war of annihilation against their entire folklore". &lt;ref&gt;Felix Dahn: ''Ein Kampf um Rom'' , in: ''Gesammelte Werke'' (Collected Works), First Series, vol. 2, Leipzig O. J., pp. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beck, München 1985, S. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]&lt;ref&gt;Christian Pantle: ''Vernichtungskrieg in Germanien'', in: ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'', 3. September 2009 ([http://www.focus.de/wissen/bildung/varusschlacht/tid-15389/2000-jahre-varusschlacht-13-vernichtungskrieg-in-germanien_aid_432176.html online], abgerufen am 5.

Nymphenburger, München 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Find evidence that they call war of annihilation.

The ethnologist [[Otto Stoll]] wrote 1888 of a war of annihilation of the Spanish [[Conquistador | Conquistadores]] against the indigenous population.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Stoll: ''Die Maya-Sprachen der Pokom-Gruppe.

The former employee of the German [[Military History Research Office (Germany)]] [[Joachim Hoffmann]] described in his book ' ' Stalin's Annihilation War ' ' (1995) the Soviet warfare against Nazi Germany as "War of Annihilation". He cites as the motto a speech [[Josef Stalin]] s of 6 November 1941, in which this stated:

{{quote|Well, if the Germans want a ''Vernichtungskrieg'', they will get it (stormy, prolonged applause). From now on, it will be our task to be the task of all the peoples of the Soviet Union, the task of the fighters, the commanders and the [[Political commissar|political officials of our army and our fleet]], to destroy all invading Germans occupying the territory of our homeland to the last man. No mercy to the German occupiers!{{efn|''Nun wohl, wenn die Deutschen einen Vernichtungskrieg wollen, so werden sie ihn bekommen (stürmischer, lang anhaltender Beifall). Von nun an wird es unsere Aufgabe, die Aufgabe aller Völker der Sowjetunion, die Aufgabe der Kämpfer, der Kommandeure und der politischen Funktionäre unserer Armee und unserer Flotte sein, alle Deutschen, die in das Gebiet unserer Heimat als Okkupanten eingedrungen sind, bis auf den letzten Mann zu vernichten. Keine Gnade den deutschen Okkupanten!''&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Hoffmann: ''Stalins Vernichtungskrieg 1941–1945''. Verlag für Wehrwissenschaft, München 1995, S. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

Other academics do not follow Hoffmann's interpretation of the speech, but refer to Stalin's further statements in the following months that an annihilation of Germany is by no means his goal of war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernd Ulrich]]: ''Stalingrad'', C.H. Beck, München 2005, S. 33&amp;nbsp;f.; Jochen Laufer: ''Pax Sovietica. Stalin, die Westmächte und die deutsche Frage 1941–1945'', Böhlau, Köln/Weimar 2009, S. 205 ff. Vgl. auch Stalins viel zitiertes Diktum aus dem Jahr 1945: „Die Hitler kommen und gehen, aber das deutsche Volk, der deutsche Staat hat Bestand“. [[Wolfgang Leonhard]]: ''Die Revolution entläßt ihre Kinder'', S. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffmann's work as a whole was highly critically reviewed by a majority.&lt;ref&gt;For example ''[[Die Zeit]]'' Nr. 46, 1995 ([http://www.zeit.de/1995/46/Stalins_Vernichtungskrieg_ online], abgerufen am 5. August 2010), [[die tageszeitung]], 27. Dezember 1995, ''[[Historische Zeitschrift]]'' 263, 1996, S. 259 ff., ''[[Militärgeschichtliche Zeitschrift|Militärgeschichtliche Mitteilungen]]'' 56, 1997, S. 186–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is talk of an "unbridled War of Annihilation" ([[Norbert Blüm]]),&lt;ref&gt;Cited from [https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article382556/Nahost-Konflikt-entfacht-in-Deutschland-heftige-Diskussion.html ''Nahost-Konflikt entfacht in Deutschland heftige Diskussion''], in: [[Die Welt]] vom 5. April 2002; [[Alan Posener]]: ''Wo die Freundschaft aufhört. „Nazi-Methoden“, „hemmungsloser Vernichtungskrieg“, „zionistische Lobby“. Wie viel Kritik verträgt das Verhältnis zwischen Deutschland und Israel?'', in: Die Welt, 15. Mai 2002, S. 8. Vgl. dazu [[Wolfgang Benz]]: ''Was ist Antisemitismus?'', C.H. Beck, München 2004, {{ISBN|3-406-52212-2}}, [https://books.google.de/books?id=FaGpj0ORpwAC&amp;pg=PA24 S. 24].&lt;/ref&gt; or its English counterpart, "War of Extermination", when Israel's approach is described in [[Middle East conflict]] from various sides.&lt;ref&gt;See for example "Deutsche Soldaten in Israel nicht denkbar", in: [[taz.de]], 26. Juli 2006 (Interview mit [[Norman Paech]], [http://www.taz.de/?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2006/07/26/a0134 online], abgerufen am 5. August 2010).

Januar 2009 ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/17/gaza-israel-palestine online], abgerufen am 5. August 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The "Nazi comparison" implied in this wording is an indication of [[secondary antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lars Rensmann]]: ''Demokratie und Judenbild.
