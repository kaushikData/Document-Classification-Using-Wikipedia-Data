      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1354">'''722 Redemption''' is a process within the [[Bankruptcy in the United States|U.S. bankruptcy code]] under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|section 11 U.S.C. 722]] that allows a debtor to redeem collateral based on the market value of the collateral. The bankruptcy code allows a debtor to pay the retail value of the collateral in a lump sum payment to the creditor in exchange for the lien on the collateral being released. 

In order for 722 redemption to apply the item in question must be personal property intended primarily for personal, family or household use. The [[interest]] in the property must be exempted under the bankruptcy code or has to be abandoned by the bankruptcy estate in order for 722 redemption to be used. Once a bankruptcy case is filed a debtor must file a motion in court and obtain a court order to redeem the property. This process is most commonly used to redeem vehicles that are worth less than the outstanding loan on the vehicle. The process allows a debtor to pay the current market value of the vehicle versus the outstanding [[loan]] on the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/722|title=11 U.S. Code § 722 - Redemption|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2524">'''ACASS''', or '''Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System''', was developed in 1975, in response to The 1972 [[Brooks Act|Brooks Architect-Engineer Act]], Public Law 92&amp;ndash;582 (see external link below). The Brooks Act requires the public announcement of requirements for A–E services by [[List of United States federal agencies|Federal agencies]] (with some exceptions provided by other statutes); selection of the most highly qualified firms based on demonstrated competence and professional qualifications; and the negotiation of a fair and reasonable price, starting with the highest qualified firm. Hence, the selection of A–E contractors is focused on qualifications, and not the lowest price. ACASS supports procedures defined in Part 36 of the [[Federal Acquisition Regulations]] (FAR).

As envisioned, ACASS collected and distributed information used by Federal Government Selection committees in the process of awarding A–E contracts. This information included the SF 330 part II A-E Qualifications Statement submitted by A-E firms to the [[Online]] Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), limited [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] Contract Award information, and A-E Performance Evaluations. Evaluations were retained in the ACASS system for six years from the date signed by the Rating/Evaluating Official.

The ACASS number was abolished when the ACASS system transitioned to a modernized platform on October 5, 2005. The ACASS system now uses the [[D.U.N.S.]] number, in place of an ACASS number. Firms should supply their DUNS number, and notify the requestor of the discontinuation of the ACASS number, when asked for their ACASS number.

{{Usul al-fiqh}}

'''''Ahkam''''' ({{transl|ar|aḥkām}}, {{lang-ar|أحكام}} "provisions", plural of '''{{transl|ar|ḥukm}}''' ({{lang|ar|حُكْم}})) is an Islamic term with several meanings. In the Quran, the word ''hukm'' is variously used to mean arbitration, judgement, authority, or [[God in Islam|God]]'s will.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Hukm|editor=John L. Esposito|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e890}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early Islamic period, the [[Kharijite]]s gave it political connotations by declaring that they accept only the ''hukm'' of God ({{lang|ar|حُكْمُ اللّهِ}}).&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; The word acquired new meanings in the course of Islamic history, being used to refer to worldly executive power or to a court decision.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; In the plural, ''ahkam'', it commonly refers to specific Quranic rules, or to the legal rulings derived using the methodology of [[fiqh]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Sharia rulings fall into one of five categories known as "the five decisions" (''al-aḥkām al-khamsa''): [[Fard|mandatory]] (''farḍ'' or ''wājib''), [[Mustahabb|recommended]] (''mandūb'' or ''mustaḥabb''), [[Mubah|neutral]] (''mubāḥ''), [[Makruh|reprehensible]] (''makrūh''), and [[Haram|forbidden]] (''ḥarām'').&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt; According to scholar of Islam Joseph Schacht, the categories were developed at least two centuries after Muhammad's time.{{#tag:ref|"The five categories` as such are as yet unknown to Shafi'i and his predecessors." Al-Shafi'i died in 204 AH (820 AD).&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-133&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |orig-year= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

== Five ruling types ==

Sharia rulings fall into one of five categories known as “the five decisions” ({{lang|ar|الأحكام الخمسة}}, {{transl|ar|al-aḥkām al-khamsa}}):&lt;ref name=vikor&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|ref=harv |first=Knut S.|last=Vikør|title=Sharīʿah|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Politics|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Emad El-Din Shahin|year=2014|url=http://bridgingcultures.neh.gov/muslimjourneys/items/show/226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# {{transl|ar|[[farḍ]]/wājib}} ({{lang|ar|واجب / فرض}}) - compulsory, obligatory
# {{transl|ar|[[mustaḥabb]]/mandūb}} ({{lang|ar|مستحب}}) - recommended
# {{transl|ar|[[mubāḥ]]}} ({{lang|ar|مباح}}) - neutral, not involving God's judgment
# {{transl|ar|[[makrūh]]}} ({{lang|ar|مكروه}}) - disliked, reprehensible
# {{transl|ar|[[ḥarām]]/maḥzūr}} ({{lang|ar|محظور / حرام}}) - forbidden

It is a sin or a crime to perform a forbidden action or not to perform a mandatory action.&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt; Reprehensible acts should be avoided, but they are not considered to be sinful or punishable in court.&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt;&lt;ref name=hallaq20&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|first=Wael B.|last=Hallaq|authorlink = Wael Hallaq|title=An Introduction to Islamic Law |year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avoiding reprehensible acts and performing recommended acts is held to be subject of reward in the afterlife, while allowed actions entail no judgement from God.&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt;&lt;ref name=hallaq20/&gt; Jurists disagree on whether the term ''[[ḥalāl]]'' covers the first three or the first four categories.&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt; The legal and moral verdict depends on whether the action is committed out of necessity (''ḍarūra'').&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt;

== General considerations ==
{{Original research section|Includes some highly dubious statements sourced to an inaccessible book|date=May 2017}}

The ḥukm shar‘ī (aḥkām) in its literal sense carries the meaning of a rule of Islamic law. Thus aḥkām (rules) is the plural form of ḥukm (rule), which means rule, command, the absolute, order, judgment, injunction, prescription, and decree.  This rule could be a rule of any kind; it is to command one to delegate an order to another whether approval or disapproval. You could say that the moon is rising or the moon is not rising,  or that fire burns.&lt;ref name=kayadibi&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kayadibi|first1=Saim|title=Principles of Islamic Law and the Methods of Interpretation of the Texts (Uṣūl al-Fiqh)|date=2017|publisher=Islamic Book Trust|location=Kuala Lumpur|isbn=978 967 0526 33 1|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, it is considered a rule of Islamic law. Āmidī (d. 631/1234)  defines adillah as the science of the proofs of fiqh and the indications that they provide with regard to the aḥkām of the sharī‘ah.&lt;ref name=kayadibi/&gt; The ḥukm shar‘ī consists of four fundamental elements. These elements are: the Ḥākim (Lawgiver), the maḥkūm alayh (the subject), the maḥkūm fīh (the act of the mukallaf), and the ḥukm (ruling).&lt;ref name=kayadibi/&gt;

==Emergency conditions==
Religious precepts may be relaxed under certain extraordinary conditions.  For example, although Muslims are required to fast during [[Ramadan]], it is not only acceptable but recommended for an ill man to break his fast if fasting will worsen his illness.

==Fatwa==
It is similar to but differs from a [[fatwa]].&lt;ref name="Modarresi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|authorlink=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|title=The Laws of Islam|date=26 March 2016|publisher=Enlight Press|isbn=978-0994240989|url=http://almodarresi.com/en/books/pdf/TheLawsofIslam.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2017|ref=Modarresi|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|471}}

[[File:Veganarchism whiteVA.svg|thumb|150px|Flag of [[veganarchism]]]]
[[File:Veganarchism.svg|thumb|150px|[[Veganarchy]] symbol popularised by Brian A. Dominick's ''Animal Liberation and Social Revolution'' pamphlet in 1995&lt;ref name="brian"&gt;Dominick, Brian. ''Animal Liberation and Social Revolution: A vegan perspective on anarchism or an anarchist perspective on veganism'', Critical Mess Media, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:ALF logo.svg|ALF|thumb|150px|[[Animal Liberation Front|ALF]] logo]]
The [[Anarchism|anarchist]] philosophical and [[political movement]] has some connections to elements of the [[animal liberation movement]]. Many anarchists are [[vegetarian]] or [[vegan]] (or [[veganarchists]]) and have played a role in combating perceived injustices against animals. They usually describe the struggle for the liberation of [[non-human]] animals as a natural outgrowth of the struggle for [[human freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anarchism – MSN Encarta&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt; |url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770_3/Anarchism.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKIPxjP?url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568770_3/Anarchism.html |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
[[Leo Tolstoy]] (1828–1910) was a vegetarian, [[pacifism|pacifist]] and [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]]. In ''On Civil Disobedience'' he wrote: "A man can live and be healthy without killing animals for food; therefore, if he eats meat, he participates in taking animal life merely for the sake of his appetite. And to act so is immoral."

=== Veganism and anarchism&lt;!--'Veganarchism' redirects here. --&gt; ===
{{see also|Green anarchism}}
'''Veganarchism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the [[political philosophy]] of [[veganism]] (more specifically [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]]) and anarchism, creating a combined [[praxis (process)|praxis]] as a means for [[social revolution]].&lt;ref name="essay"&gt;Dominick, Brian. ''Animal Liberation and Social Revolution: A vegan perspective on anarchism or an anarchist perspective on veganism'', third edition, Firestarter Press, 1997, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="page5" /&gt; This encompasses viewing the [[State (polity)|state]] as unnecessary and harmful to [[animal]]s, both [[human]] and non-human, whilst practicing a vegan lifestyle. Veganarchists either see the ideology as a combined theory, or [[perceive]] both [[philosophies]] to be essentially the same.&lt;ref name="page1"&gt;Dominick, Brian. ''Animal Liberation and Social Revolution: A vegan perspective on anarchism or an anarchist perspective on veganism'', third edition, Firestarter Press, 1997, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is further described as an [[anti-speciesist]] perspective on [[green anarchism]], or an [[anarchist]] perspective on animal liberation.&lt;ref name="page5" /&gt;

The term was popularized in 1995 with Brian A. Dominick's pamphlet ''Animal Liberation and Social Revolution'', described as "a vegan perspective on anarchism or an anarchist perspective on veganism".&lt;ref name="brian"/&gt; The 18-page pamphlet explains how many young anarchists in the 1990s had been adopting [[deep ecology|deep ecological]] (animal-inclusive and anti-speciesist) mindsets as part of an overall green anarchist political philosophy. Similarly, animal liberationists were becoming increasingly influenced by [[anarchist thought]] and traditions, thus becoming veganarchists and adopting an overall praxis.&lt;ref name="page5"&gt;Dominick, Brian. ''Animal Liberation and Social Revolution: A vegan perspective on anarchism or an anarchist perspective on veganism'', third edition, Firestarter Press, 1997, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Direct action ==
{{main|Animal liberation movement|Leaderless resistance|Timeline of ALF actions}}
[[Direct action]], an important philosophical component of anarchism, is also common within the animal rights movement. Activists using names such as [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] (SHAC) and [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF) use direct action techniques, including animal liberation, violence and [[property destruction]]. Industries targeted include; [[Meat industry|meat]], [[Dairy industry|dairy]], [[animal testing]], [[fur farm|fur]], other [[animal products|animal based]] industries, private citizens and government institutions.

Frequently, in the case of [[Animal Rights Militia]] (ARM), [[Animal Liberation Brigade]] (ALB) and [[Justice Department (animal rights)|Justice Department]] (JD) have carried out [[political violence]] against people.  The allegedly decentralized and [[Leaderless resistance|leaderless structure]] of the Animal Liberation Front could be seen as an example of anarchistic organizing, acting in [[autonomous]], [[covert cells]].

== Convictions ==
{{main|GANDALF trial|SHAC 7|Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty#Operation Achilles}}
[[Rod Coronado]] is an [[Eco-anarchism|eco-anarchist]] and is an unofficial spokesperson for the Animal Liberation Front and [[Earth Liberation Front]]. On February 28, 1992, Coronado carried out an [[arson]] attack on research facilities at [[Michigan State University]] (MSU), and released [[mink]] from a nearby research farm on campus, an action claimed by the ALF, and for which Coronado was subsequently convicted.

In 1997, the editors of ''[[Green Anarchist]]'' magazine and two British supporters of the Animal Liberation Front were tried in connection with conspiracy to incite violence, in what came to be known as the [[GANDALF trial]].

The book was on the [[New York Times Best Seller|''New York Times'' best-seller]] list in both the sports and civil rights categories for four consecutive months. It received the 2015 [[Lillian Smith Book Award]] and a Special Recognition Award by the [[Robert F. Kennedy]] Book Awards Foundation.

Maraniss attended Vanderbilt University in 1992 on a [[Fred Russell]]-[[Grantland Rice]]  Scholarship for Sports Journalism. He won the school's Charles Foster Alexander Award for excellence in journalism in 1992 and in 2016 was inducted in the Vanderbilt Student Media Hall of Fame. He was designated Vanderbilt's "Writer-in-Residence" in 2017. The popularity of the book reoriented his former career in public relations into that of full-time author. Maraniss' father, [[David Maraniss]], is a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author and associate editor for the ''[[Washington Post]]''.

==A family of writers==

Maraniss was born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], the son of David and Linda Maraniss who met there in high school.&lt;ref name="madisonandpress"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Book Festival/Andrew Marannis|url=https://www.wisconsinbookfestival.org/presenters/andrew-maraniss|website=wisconsinbookfestival.com|publisher=Madison Public Library|accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, Elliott Maraniss, was editor of Madison's ''Capital Times'' newspaper in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="dougmoemadison"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moe|first1=Doug|title=Doug Moe: Another Maraniss, another compelling tale|url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/columnists/doug-moe/doug-moe-another-maraniss-another-compelling-tale/article_c7b95e8d-2390-5f4a-a58c-dadfdf334501.html|website=host.madison.com|publisher=Wisconsin State Journal|accessdate=April 23, 2018|date=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandmother, Mary Maraniss, was a 1966 graduate of the [[University of Wisconsin]], [[Phi Beta Kappa]], and book editor for the [[University of Wisconsin Press]].&lt;ref name="maryobituary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Maraniss/Obituary|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/jsonline/obituary.aspx?n=mary-maraniss&amp;pid=16495333&amp;fhid=3716|website=legacy.com|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|accessdate=April 26, 2018|date=January 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earlylifemadison"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kolker|first1=Jeanne|title=David Maraniss continues to go where his subjects take him|url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/entertainment/arts_and_theatre/books/david-maraniss-continues-to-go-where-his-subjects-take-him/article_fc03a8aa-7b1b-5ca2-983d-7fc58c2c9166.html|website=host.madison.com|publisher=Wisconsin State Journal|accessdate=April 23, 2018|date=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marannis' father, David, has been associate editor of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' since 1977&lt;ref name="fatherwas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Piarrot|first1=Henry|title=Son of a journalist is award-winner like father|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=19456790|accessdate=April 22, 2018|issue=Davidson A.M./Southeast|publisher=Tennessean (Nashville)|date=December 26, 2003|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won a [[Pulitzer prize]] for national reporting in 1993 for his coverage of [[Bill Clinton]]'s candidacy during the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]].&lt;ref name="pulitzerwinner"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pulitzer Prizes/National Reporting/Winners/1993|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/david-maraniss|website=pulitzer.org|publisher=The Pulitzer Prizes|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The senior Maraniss said  that his son Andrew "has always been more mature than Linda and I",&lt;ref name="earlylifemadison"/&gt; a child who would save his candy rather than eat it all at once. When Andrew was young,  his father was a budding journalist who found a job at the ''Trenton Times'' in New Jersey, that necessitated the family's move from Wisconsin to the east coast. In the 1970s another job opened up at the ''Washington Post''  so they moved to Washington, D.C.    As a youth in the late 1970s, Andrew attended press conferences with his father.  When Maraniss was in high school, his father was transferred to [[Austin, Texas]], to serve as southwest bureau chief for the ''Post''.

==Early life==

While in high school in Austin, Maraniss was sports editor for the school paper, the Austin High ''Maroon''.&lt;ref name="internstatesman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Halliburton|first1=Suzanne|title=Andrew Maraniss in town to talk about his book on Perry Wallace|url=http://collegesports.blog.statesman.com/2015/03/30/andrew-maraniss-in-town-to-talk-about-his-book-on-perry-wallace/|website=collegesports.blog.statesman.com|publisher=Statesman (Gatehouse Media)|accessdate=April 24, 2018|date=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He got a job writing sports articles as an intern for the ''Austin American–Statesman''.&lt;ref name="internstatesman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="austinsample"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maraniss|first1=Andrew|title=Cowboys Scrimmage tickets on sale July 14 at Burger|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/358500970/?terms=%22Andrew+Maraniss%22|accessdate=April 22, 2018|publisher=Austin American–Statesman|date=June 30, 1990|page=D–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A poster at school about a college  scholarship caught his attention and prompted him to submit his news clippings to apply for it.&lt;ref name="dougmoemadison"/&gt; His writing won him a [[Fred Russell]]-[[Grantland Rice]] Sportswriting Scholarship to Vanderbilt University in 1988. Sportswriting Hall-of-Famer [[Fred Russell]], for whom the sportswriting scholarship is named, took the four recipients out to lunch a couple of times a year and developed personal relationships with them.&lt;ref name="mediahof"/&gt; The tradition continued until Russell's death in 2003.  Maraniss worked his way up to sports editor of the ''Hustler'', the college newspaper.&lt;ref name="fatherwas"/&gt; After graduation, he had a job as Vanderbilt basketball sports information director.&lt;ref name="joebiddle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Biddle|first1=Joe|title=Nashville's NFL team may have a giant name change|agency=newspapers.com|publisher=Tennessean (Nashville)|date=October 30, 1998|page=2C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Strong Inside''==

In 1989, as a 19 year old student, he read an article in a student publication about [[Perry Wallace]]. One of his professors, Yolette Jones (associate dean in the College of Arts and Sciences as of 2017), suggested that he interview Wallace who was then a law professor in Baltimore. Maraniss did so, and wrote two papers about Wallace and some student newspaper articles. Maraniss recalled, "I remember sitting on the floor of my dormitory, scribbling in a notebook and feeling like the world was opening up to me as I talked to the most impressive person I had ever talked to before".&lt;ref name="residencezeppos"/&gt;  After graduation Maraniss stayed on, working as associate director of media relations for Vanderbilt Athletics from 1992 to 1997. In 1998 he moved to [[Tampa]], taking a job as Media Relations Manager for the inaugural season of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]].&lt;ref name="tampamedia"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sports/Transactions/Baseball|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/392842891/|accessdate=April 22, 2018|agency=newspapers.com|publisher=Daily News (New York)|date=December 4, 1997|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to Nashville to join a public relations firm, McNeely, Pigott and Fox&lt;ref name="joebiddle"/&gt; and became a partner there for 18 years.

Following the success of Maraniss' book, a motion picture documentary depicting Wallace's life has been made by filmmaker Rich Gentile, entitled "Triumph: The Untold Story of Perry Wallace".

{{Refimprove|date=April 2014}}
[[File:No Smoking.svg|thumb|upright|[[Smoking]] is now [[smoking ban|banned]] in public buildings in many parts of the world.]]
A '''ban''' is a formal or informal [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{OED|ban}}&lt;/ref&gt; of something. Bans are formed for the prohibition of activities within a certain political territory. Some see this as a negative act (equating it to a form of [[censorship]] or [[discrimination]]) and others see it as maintaining the "''[[status quo]]''". Some bans in commerce are referred to as [[embargo]]es. ''Ban'' is also used as a verb similar in meaning to "to prohibit".

==Etymology==
{{see|ban (medieval)}}
In current English usage, ''ban'' is mostly synonymous with ''prohibition''. Historically, Old English ''(ge)bann'' is a derivation from the verb ''bannan'' "to summon, command, proclaim" from an earlier [[Common Germanic]] ''*bannan'' "to command, forbid, banish, curse". The modern sense "to prohibit" is influenced by the cognate [[Old Norse]] ''banna'' "to curse, to prohibit" and also from [[Old French]] ''ban'', ultimately a loan from [[Old Frankish]], meaning "[[outlawry]], banishment".&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

The Indo-European etymology of the Germanic term is from a root ''*bha-'' meaning "to speak". Its original meaning was [[magical thinking|magical]], referring to utterances that carried a power to [[curse]].

== Banned political parties ==

In many countries [[political party|political parties]] or groups are banned. Parties may be banned for many reasons, including extremism and anti-democratic ideologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Issacharoff|first=Samuel|title=Fragile Democracies|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=2007-03-31|volume=120|page=1405}}&lt;/ref&gt; on ethnic or religious grounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogaards|first=Matthijs |author2=Matthias Basedau |author3=Christof Hartmann|title=Ethnic party bans in Africa: an introduction|journal=Democratization|date=2010-07-21|volume=17|issue=4|page=599|doi=10.1080/13510347.2010.491183}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2014-02-02--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes simply because the group opposes government policies, with the ban sometimes alleging wrongdoing as the cause.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/22/zimbabwe.andrewmeldrum The Guardian newspaper: Zimbabwe bans political rallies as unrest grows, 22 February 2007]. Example of a ban on political protests declared legal by a court.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]], for instance, has a long history behind its modern practice of banning political parties. The [[Nazi Party]] was banned in 1923; after the Nazi Party came into power in 1933 opposing parties such as the Social Democrats and [[Communist Party]] were banned, the Nazi Party was again banned and the ban on other parties lifted after the Nazi defeat in 1945, and the Communist Party was again banned from 1956 to 1968.

== Banning marriages ==
There have been many bans on marriages, and sometimes other sexual liaisons, between people of different ethnic background or religion, for example between non-Jews and Jews in Nazi Germany, people classified as "white" and non-whites in [[apartheid]] South Africa, etc.

For much of the 1800s and 1900s there were bans on marriage between people of different races ([[interracial marriage]]) in many of the [[United States]]. However, the ban on interracial marriage was overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1967 in the landmark [[civil rights]] case ''[[Loving vs. Virginia]]'', in which the Court ruled [[Virginia]]'s [[miscegenation]] law an [[unconstitutional]] violation of the fundamental right to marriage. Historically [[child marriage]] was common, but is now banned in many countries.

== Banned persons ==
{{See also|List of people subject to banning orders under apartheid}}

The [[Imperial ban]] was a form of [[outlaw]]ry in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. At different times, it could be declared by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], by courts including the [[Vehmic court|League of the Holy Court]] ({{lang-de|Vehmgericht}}, {{IPA-de|féːmgəʀɪχt|pron}}) and the {{lang|de|[[Reichskammergericht]]}}, or by the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]. People under Imperial ban lost all their rights and possessions, and anyone had the right to rob, injure or kill such persons without legal consequences. The Imperial ban automatically followed the [[excommunication]] of a person, and extended to anyone offering help to a person under the imperial ban.

During the [[apartheid]] régime in [[South Africa]], the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government issued banning orders to individuals seen to be threats to its power — often black politicians or organizations — these banning orders acted as [[suppression order]]s. Individuals banned by the [[Suppression of Communism Act, 1950]] (which effectively defined "Communism" as opposition to the government) could not communicate with more than one person at any time unless at home (thus preventing them from engaging in political activities), travel to areas{{clarify|date=August 2016}} without government approval, or leave the country.

==Censorship==
Existing publications may be banned, and new publications prohibited from discussing certain topics or taking certain viewpoints. [[Censorship]] is the enacting and enforcing of such bans.

==Health and safety==
Bans in various jurisdictions on [[Overview of gun laws by nation|possession of some weapons]], [[Smoking ban|smoking]], and [[Prohibition of drugs|narcotic drugs]] are enacted to exert control over the [[general public]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">{{For|the current court|Borgarting Court of Appeal}}
The '''Borgarting''' was one of the major popular assemblies or [[Thing (assembly)|thing]]s (''lagting'') of medieval [[Norway]].  Historically it was the site of the court and assembly for the southern coastal region of Norway from the south-eastern border with [[Sweden]], westwards to the today's [[Risør]] in [[Aust-Agder]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/Borgarting|title= ''Borgarting''|work=Store norske leksikon|accessdate=6 April 2013|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borgarting was named after its seat, the town of Borg (today [[Sarpsborg]]). It was established before 1164 when it absorbed the districts [[Grenland]] and [[Telemark]]. When Norway was united as a kingdom, the first lagtings were constituted as superior regional assemblies. The ancient regional assemblies – [[Frostating]], [[Gulating]], [[Eidsivating]] and Borgarting – were eventually joined into a single [[jurisdiction]]. King [[Magnus VI of Norway|Magnus Lagabøte]] had the existing body of law put into writing (1263–1280). In 1274, Magnus promulgated the new national law (''[[Magnus Lagabøtes landslov]]''), a unified code of laws to apply for the Kingdom of Norway. This compilation of the codified [[Gulating]] laws (''Gulatingsloven'') applied throughout the realm extending to overseas possessions including the [[Faroe islands]] and [[Shetland]].

This page is about the [[Sentence (law)|penalties]] [[Juvenile delinquency|juveniles]] are subject to if found guilty of trafficking [[Cannabis (drug)|Cannabis]]. Most juveniles suffer the same, or very similar, penalties as adults. However this varies between countries, cultures and according to where the nation's minimum [[age of criminal responsibility]] lies. Information and laws regarding minors are difficult to find as they are usually [[classified information|classified]] or protected. This is due to laws preventing crimes committed, under the minimum age of criminal responsibility, being kept on a criminal record.

In some countries, possession or trafficking of Cannabis (also known as Marijuana, Hashish, Weed, Grass, Pot) is an outrageous felony, punishable with life sentences or the death penalty. Other countries (mainly in the western world) consider cannabis a recreational drug and in the last decade some have even decriminalised the use of Cannabis and allow it to be used for medical purposes. Penalties for possession or trafficking of Cannabis vary a lot.

The political structure of Switzerland consists of three different political levels: the Confederation, the 26 cantons, and the local authorities. The Confederation only has authority where it is empowered by the Constitution, the Cantons deal with all the other tasks. In some areas, the Confederation and the cantons share certain responsibilities. The organisation of the courts and the jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters stays with the cantons.

The Swiss court system is divided into civil, criminal, and administrative courts. Cantonal courts apply federal law when dealing with civil and criminal matters. The Swiss Federal Supreme Court is primarily a court of last resort.

The juridical system is organised in three grades of judgement: 1 Trial (First Instance – cantonal level), 2 Appeal (Second Instance – cantonal level), 3 Federal Supreme Court (Third and last Instance – federal level).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/switzerland-prisoner-pack|title=Switzerland – Prisoner Pack - Publications - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a minor incurs in any unlawful importation of narcotic, thus including cannabis, sanctions will be decided on the quantity by a judge of minors in the concerned canton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ezv.admin.ch|title=- socialmedia_absender|website=www.ezv.admin.ch|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== England ====

England's Judicial System is structured as follows; Magistrates Court, which deals with less serious crimes, and the Crown Court, which deals with more serious crimes. The accused or the prosecution may appeal to the High Court if they don't agree with the trial's outcome. If the accused or prosecution don't accept the High Courts outcome, they may take their case to the court of appeal. Once the Court of Appeal has made a decision, further appeals to the Supreme Court will only be heard if the case meets the regulations as outlined in the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and the Administration of Justice Act 1960. 
Criminal cases involving minors are tried in a Magistrates Court and are usually completed there, in exceptional cases of general public importance youth offenders may be tried at a higher level. 
Criminal cases involving drugs are tried in the Crown Court and may be appealed in higher courts as well.

The [[Legal system of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Judicial System]] is based on [[Sharia|Sharia law]], it is divided in two sections: Public Right and Private Right.

The Private Right section allows an individual to claim restitution from another person if they are injured, as a result of the accused actions.It also gives the injured person legal heirs the right to either claim or waive the right to claim compensation or the imposition of the death penalty.

The Public Right section allows the judicial authorities to pursue and prosecute an individual suspected of committing a criminal act.

Civil 'Private Right' cases are bail-able but Criminal 'Public Right' cases are not. A person accused of a Private Right offence would be asked to provide either financial guarantee or an appearance guarantee, or both.

The [[Singapore judicial system|Singapore Judicial System]] consists of the Supreme Court and the State Courts. The Supreme Court hears both civil and criminal cases and consists of the Court of Appeal and the High Court. The Court of Appeal exercises appellate criminal and civil jurisdiction, while the High Court exercises both original and appellate criminal and civil jurisdiction.

The [[Juvenile court|Juvenile Court]] is the State Court which takes care of offences committed by minors. It is empowered to deal with juvenile offenders &lt;u&gt;by putting them under the care of someone else as deemed fit.&lt;/u&gt; The court can also give community service orders, probation orders, as well as require the offender to undergo detention and reformative training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/about-us/the-supreme-court/singapore-judicial-system|title=Singapore Judicial System|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USA Judicial System consists of three main components: the Law enforcement, the Courts and the Corrections. Crimes fall under two main categories: misdemeanour's, which is less serious and felony, which is more serious. The USA's Court System is structured as follows; [[County court|County Courts]], [[State court (United States)|State Courts]] and [[Federal Courts of the United States|Federal Courts]]. The Federal Courts consist of the Supreme court and the lower courts (trial courts and appeal courts). The Supreme Court can overthrow any lower courts decision. Criminal cases are usually tried at State level. If at the end of the trial the defendant is found guilty, he can appeal to the lower courts at Federal level. 
To decide whether to commence trial proceedings, the US Attorney must provide the [[Grand jury|Grand Jury]] with all evidence against the [[defendant]], so they may decide whether the defendant is required to stand trial. Depending on the charges the Judge decides whether the defendant should be held in Jail until trial (cases can take up to 18 months before going to trial). Before a trial the defendant is often offered a [[plea bargain]] by the [[United States Attorney|US attorney]], if the defendant accepts the plea bargain the case is not taken to trial. 
During a criminal trial it is the governments duty to provide the trial with evidence proving the defendants guilt, the defendants do not provide evidence to prove innocence. If at the end of the trial the defendant is not found guilty, he is released and the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] may not appeal.

==== Colombia ====

The [[Judiciary of Colombia|Colombian Judiciary System]] is made of a Constitutional Court, Supreme Court of Justice, Council of State, the Higher Judiciary Council, and superior and municipal courts. It does not have a single supreme entity to oversee the lower courts, instead it has four high courts, which are the supreme tribunals of decision in their respective fields. The four high courts are the Constitutional Court (head of the constitutional jurisdiction), the Supreme Court (head of the ordinary jurisdiction), the Council of State (head of the administrative jurisdiction), and the Superior Council of Judicature (head of the disciplinary jurisdiction).

It is legal to possess up to 20 grams or 20 plants of marijuana for personal use only. Marijuana is also legalized for medical and scientific purpose. Anyone trafficking marijuana for other purposes can expect long prison sentences from 4 to 20 years under harsh conditions. Colombian law also requires serious offenders to remain in the country to serve a lengthy parole (in which the offenders aren't given housing and might not be permitted to work) after their release from jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryreports.org/travel/Colombia/criminalpenalties.htm|title=ColombiaCriminal Penalties - CountryReports|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charitable contribution deductions''' for [[United States]] [[Income tax in the United States|Federal Income Tax]] purposes are defined in section 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code as contributions to or for the use of certain nonprofit enterprises. See {{usc|26|170(c).}}

== Exclusions of certain amounts from deduction==
Certain portions of the market value of non-cash donations, such as short-term capital gains, are made non-deductible by I.R.C. 170(e)(1)(A).

== Organization eligibility ==
An organization must meet certain requirements set forth in the code. Some organizations must also file a request with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to gain status as a [[tax-exempt]] [[non-profit]] charitable organization under section [[501(c)(3)]] of the tax code.

A non-exhaustive list of organizations that may meet the Federal requirements are as follows:

*[[Synagogue]]s, [[Church (building)|churches]] and other [[Religion|religious]] organizations;
*A fraternal order or lodge
*An organization of war [[veterans]]
*Any level of [[government]] if the contribution is made for exclusively public purposes
*An organization dedicated to the improvement of public health in the U.S. or abroad

There are both public and private charities.  Public charities are far more common.

== Effect of benefit to donor ==
Contributions to charitable organizations are deductible to the [[Donation|donor]], ''unless'' the [[donee]] organization uses any of its [[net earnings]] to benefit a private shareholder, or if it attempts to in any way influence political campaigns or [[legislation]].  

A contribution to a charitable organization need not be fully a "gift" in the statutory sense of the word to be deductible to the donor. The donor's allowable deduction will be reduced, however, by the amount of the "substantial benefit" conferred upon them as a result of their contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IRS Publication 526|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p526/ar02.html#en_US_2010_publink1000229650|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

To illustrate, suppose that the [[American Cancer Society]] is hosting a formal dance as a fund-raiser (the ACS is a certified charitable organization). Further suppose that the [[fair market value]] of a ticket to the dance is $75, and that the donor pays $375 to purchase a ticket. The donor may claim only a $300 deduction, because the amount contributed ($375) is reduced by the amount of the benefit that he received ($75, the fair market value of the ticket). This holds true even if the donor does not actually attend the dance. 

The taxable income of the donor is reduced by $300. If the donor's income was in the 35% income tax bracket both before and after the deduction, the donor's tax liability (amount of taxes owed to the government) is reduced by $105.

== Types of contributions ==
The particular tax consequences of a donor's charitable contribution depends on the ''type'' of contribution that he makes.  A taxpayer may contribute [[Service (economics)|services]], [[cash]], or [[property]] to a charity.  There are a number of traps, especially that donations of short-term capital gains are generally not tax deductible.

=== Services ===
If the donor is contributing his services to a charity, he is not entitled to a deduction for those services.  He is however, entitled to deduct his unreimbursed expenses that he incurred in rendering them (except for child care expenses, which are considered non-deductible personal expenses).

====Example====
Joy is a professional soccer player who lives in [[San Diego]].  She decides to volunteer her time at a non-profit (certified charity) soccer camp, located in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] for a week.  In the ordinary course of things, Joy would charge $10,000 for these services, plus costs of transportation, board, and child care.  Assume that Joy's driving costs (gas money, oil change, etc.) amount to $150, the cost of a hotel room for the week is $400, and the cost of child care for her two kids is $500 for the week.

Joy is '''not''' entitled to deduct the $10,000 value of "free services" that she performed.  Nor is she entitled to deduct the $500 of child care expenses incurred in the week she was volunteering.  However, Joy ''may'' deduct the $150 car expenses, as well as the $400 hotel expenses incurred in her time volunteering at the camp, for a total deduction of $550.

=== Cash ===
If the donor is contributing cash to the charity, the general rule is that there is only one limitation on the total amount that he is entitled to deduct:  He may only deduct his contribution to the extent that it does not exceed 50% of his [[Adjusted Gross Income|adjusted gross income]].  Any amount not deducted in the year he makes the contribution may be carried forward and taken the next year for up to 5 years.  Ordinary assets and short-term capital gain assets (''see below'') are treated like cash for purposes of the 50% cap.

====Example====
To illustrate, suppose that the donor has an adjusted gross income of $100,000.  In the year 2004, he gives $60,000 in cash to the American Cancer Society.  The donor may deduct ''only'' $50,000 in 2004.  Why?  Because anything over that amount is in excess of 50% of his adjusted gross income (100,000 adjusted gross income × 50% = 50,000).  The remaining $10,000 (60,000 total donation − 50,000 deducted in 2004 = 10,000) carries forward to 2005, at which point he may deduct it.

=== Property ===
If the donor is contributing [[Capital appreciation|appreciated property]], he is entitled to deduct the ''value'' of that property on his tax return for that year.  Neither he nor the donee organization will pay tax on the appreciation in the property.

As is common in federal income taxation, there are several special rules and  limitations that apply:

====Ordinary income-producing property and short-term capital gain property====
If the property that the donor is contributing would have produced either only an [[ordinary income|ordinary gain]] or a [[short-term capital gain]] had he sold it, then he may deduct only his [[adjusted basis]] in the contributed property.  The taxpayer may not deduct contributions in an amount greater than 50% of his adjusted gross income (AGI) in the year of donation.  Any excess may be carried forward for up to 5 years and may be deducted subject to the same limitations.

=====Example=====
Abby, our taxpayer, owns a sporting goods store.  Her business is doing well so she decides to donate some of last season's inventory to The Women's Sports Foundation, a certified charitable organization.  

Abby's adjusted gross income this year is $700,000.  The fair market value of Abby's donated inventory is $600,000.  Her adjusted basis in the inventory is $400,000.  If Abby had sold the inventory, she would have recognized an ordinary gain of $200,000 (fmv of $600,000 − adjusted basis of $400,000 = $200,000).  

To determine the amount that she may deduct as a charitable contribution, Abby must subtract the ordinary gain inherent in the inventory (the $200,000) from the inventory's fair market value (the $600,000).  Thus, the amount of Abby's gift is $400,000 (fmv of $600,000 − inventory's inherent ordinary gain of $200,000 = $400,000 gift).

But remember, Abby may not deduct any contributions over 50% of her adjusted gross income.  Recall that Abby's AGI is $700,000.  The amount of her gift is $400,000.  The result?   Since 50% of her AGI equals $350,000 ($700,000 × .50 = $350,000), Abby may only deduct $350,000 of the 400,000 gift in the year that she donated it.  However, assuming her AGI in year ''two'' remains ''at least'' $100,001, and assuming that Abby makes no charitable contributions in year two, she may carry over the $50,000 (400,000 gift − 350,000 year one deduction = 50,000 carry over) to year two, and deduct it on her tax return that year.

====Long-term capital gain property====
Charitable donations to public charities and private foundations are subject to overall caps of 50% and 30%, respectively.  For example, if a taxpayer contributes cash or short term capital gain property to a public charity, and that cash and property is greater than 50% of his or her adjusted gross income, then any additional contribution (including long term capital gain property) to any charity in that same year can not be deducted.  

If a donor is contributing property that would have yielded a [[long-term capital gain]] in a sale, then the deduction for the contribution is limited to 30% of donor's adjusted gross income in the year of donation if the donee is a public charity, and limited to 20% if the donee is a private foundation.  Contributions over the respective AGI thresholds may be carried forward for five years, and may be deducted in subsequent years pursuant to the same restrictions.  This restriction helps certain investors avoid giving themselves into such a low bracket that the tax value of the donation is impaired.

====Short-term capital gain property====
A trap for the unwary U.S. investor with an asset on which there have been gains in value who contributes the asset before the gains become long-term.  The premature gift forfeits deduction of the short-term gains.  The asset can be deducted only up to the amount of its basis, and not up to the amount of its appreciated market value.  Only an investor who holds the asset until the capital gains have become long-term is allowed to deduct the appreciated market value.  

Internal Revenue Code 170(e)(1)(A) provides: 

(e) Certain contributions of ordinary income and capital gain property 

(1) General rule
The amount of any charitable contribution of property otherwise taken into account under this section shall be reduced by the sum of—

(A) the amount of gain which would not have been long-term capital gain if the property contributed had been sold by the taxpayer at its fair market value (determined at the time of such contribution) ...

====Short-term capital loss property====
A further trap awaits the unwary U.S. investor who donates depreciated assets—assets on which there have been losses in value—to charity.  The gift actually forfeit the tax deductibility of the capital losses, and only the depreciated (low) market value at the time of the gift is allowed to be deducted, rather than the higher basis.  However an investor can instead sell the depreciated assets before considering a donation.  An investor who sells can realize the resultant capital loss, which may then be deducted under the applicable capital loss rules.  The cash proceeds after liquidating the depreciated asset may of course be donated to charity and deducted following the sale, but the tax advantages of making such donation are no better or worse than in any cash donation to charity.  In any case, such a course leaves the investor more after-tax assets to donate if so inclined.

The '''''Collectiones canonum Dionysianae''''' ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: '''Dionysian collections of canons''') are the several [[collections of ancient canons]] prepared by the Scythian monk [[Dionysius Exiguus|Dionysius 'the humble' (''exiguus'')]]. They include the '''''Collectio conciliorum Dionysiana I''''', the '''''Collectio conciliorum Dionysiana II''''', and the '''''Collectio decretalium Dionysiana'''''. They are of the utmost importance for the development of the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law tradition in the West]].

Towards 500 a [[Scythian monk]], known as [[Dionysius Exiguus]], who had come to Rome after the death of [[Pope Gelasius I|Pope Gelasius]] (496), and who was well skilled in both Latin and Greek, undertook to bring out a more exact translation of the canons of the Greek councils. In a second effort he collected papal decretals from [[Siricius]] (384-89) to [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]] (496-98), inclusive, anterior therefore, to [[Pope Symmachus]] (514-23). By order of [[Pope Hormisdas]] (514-23), Dionysius made a third collection, in which he included the original text of all the canons of the Greek councils, together with a Latin version of the same; but the preface alone has survived. Finally, he combined the first and second in one collection, which thus united the canons of the councils and the papal decretals; it is in this shape that the work of Dionysius has reached us.

This collection opens with a table or list of titles, each of which is afterwards repeated before the respective canons; then come the first fifty canons of the Apostles, the canons of the Greek councils, the canons of Carthage (419), and the canons of preceding African synods under Aurelius, which had been read and inserted in the Council of Carthage. This first part of the collection is closed by a letter of Pope [[Boniface I]], read at the same council, letters of [[Cyril of Alexandria]] and [[Atticus of Constantinople]] to the African Fathers, and a letter of Pope [[Celestine I]]. The second part of the collection opens likewise with a preface, in the shape of a letter to the priest Julian, and a table of titles; then follow one decretal of [[Siricius]], twenty-one of [[Innocent I]], one of [[Zozimus]], four of [[Boniface I]], three of [[Celestine I]], seven of [[pope Leo I]], one of [[Gelasius I]] and one of [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]]. The additions met with in Voel and Justel are taken from inferior manuscripts.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;It was first printed in the first volume of {{harvp|Voel|Justel|1661}}, re-edited by Lepelletier (Paris, 1687), and reprinted in ''Patrologia Latina'' LXVII. A more satisfactory edition is that of [[Cuthbert Hamilton Turner]], in ''Ecclesiæ Occidentalis Monumenta Juris Antiquissima'' (Oxford, 1899-1939), vol. II, fasc. II.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the year 500, during the pontificate of Pope Symmachus (498–514), Dionysius collected and translated into Latin the canons of the major eastern councils, including the so-called ''Canones apostolorum'', the decrees of the councils of Nicaea (325), Ancyra (314), Neocaesarea (314×320), Gangra (343/55), Antioch (ca. 328), Laodicaea (343×380), Constantinople (381), Sardica (343), Chalcedon (451), and the so-called ''Codex Apiarii causae'', the last being a collection of dossiers that includes the canons, letters and acts pertaining to the council held in Carthage on 25 May, 419.

Dionysius did this at the request of Stephen, bishop of Salona, and a certain 'dearest brother Laurence' (''carissimus frater Laurentius'') who (as we learn from Dionysius's preface to his collection) had been 'offended by the awkwardness of the older [''priscae''] translation'.  It is not certain, but it may have been within the context of the Symmachan-Laurentian dispute that these requests were made of Dionysius. Eckhard Wirbelauer, reviving several older arguments, has recently argued that Dionysius's collection was meant to stand in direct opposition to the views of Pope Symmachus, and thus it was likely to have won neither the favour nor acceptance of that pope, nor possibly (at least at first) his immediate successor and strong supporter, Pope Hormisdas.&lt;ref&gt;E. Wirbelauer, ''Zwei Päpste in Rom: der Konflikt zwischen Laurentius und Symmachus (498–514). Studien und Texte'', Quellen und Forschungen zur antiken Welt 16 (Munich, 1993), pp. 132–34. See also N.J. Richards, ''The Popes and the papacy in the early Middle Ages, 476– 752'' (London, 1979), pp. 86–87, 109, 116. For criticism of the view that Dionysius compiled his collection in response to the Symmachan-Laurentian dispute ― a view that seems to have originated ultimately with Caspar and Schwartz in 1933 ― see H. Wurm, ''Studien und Texte zur Dekretalensammlung des Dionysius Exiguus'', Kanonistische Studien und Texte 16 (Bonn, 1939), pp. 2 and 16–20, and A. Firey, 'The Collectio Dionysiana', published online in 2008 on the [http://ccl.rch.uky.edu/ Carolingian Canon Law] Web site (http://ccl.rch.uky.edu/dionysiana-article), nn. 34–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Collectio conciliorum Dionysiana II''===

Shortly after preparing his first collection of conciliar canons, Dionysius prepared a second recension of the same name, to which he made important changes. He updated his translations, altered rubrics, and, perhaps most importantly, introduced a system of numbering the canons in sequence (whereas the ''Dionysiana I'' had numbered the canons of each council separately). In the ''Dionysiana II'' the ''Canones apostolorum'' were still numbered separately from 1 to 50, but now the canons of Nicaea to Constantinople were numbered in sequence from I to CLXV, 'just' (Dionysius says) 'as is found in the Greek authority [''auctoritate'']', that is in Dionysius’s Greek exemplar. Dionysius also altered the position of Chalcedon, moving it from after the ''Codex Apiarii'' to before Sardica, and removed the ''versio Attici'' of the canons of Nicaea from ''Codex Apiarii'' (found there in the ''Dionysiana I'' appended to the rescript of Atticus of Constantinople). Finally, he added an important collection of African canons to his second recension. Known today as the ''Registri ecclesiae Carthaginensis excerpta'', this 'large body of conciliar legislation from the earlier Aurelian councils'&lt;ref&gt;F.L. Cross, 'History and fiction in the African canons', ''The journal of theological studies'' 12 (1961), 227– 47, at p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; was inserted by Dionysius into the middle of the ''Codex Apiarii'' ― that is between the canons and the letters of the 419 Council of Carthage ― with the fabricated prefatory statement: 'and in that very synod [i.e. Carthage 419] were recited the various councils of the African province that had been celebrated in bygone days of Bishop Aurelius' (''Recitata sunt etiam in ista Synodo diuersa Concilia vniuersæ prouinciæ Africæ, transactis temporibus Aurelii Carthaginensis Episcopi celebrata''). Thus, the 137 'African' canons that make up ''Registri ecclesiae Carthaginensis excerpta'' in the ''Dionysiana II'' are actually a concoction of Dionysius's, a conflation of two earlier canonical collections of the African church.

The existence of a third bilingual (Greek-Latin) collection of conciliar canons, in which Dionysius removed the spurious ''Canones apostolorum'' along with the 'African' canons and the problematic canons of Sardica, can be deduced from a preface now extant in Novara, Biblioteca Capitolare, XXX (66) (written end of ninth century in northern Italy). Unfortunately, no copies of the text of this recension have survived. The fact that Pope Hormisdas, noted supporter of the previous pope Symmachus, commissioned this collection from Dionysius is significant for several of reasons. First, it indicates that Hormisdas was interested in commissioning something like an authoritative collection of Greek canons for use in the West. Second, it also poses a problem for the theory that Dionysius was a staunch supporter of Laurence's camp in the Symmachan-Laurentian conflict several years previous. Wirbelauer has attempted to explain, however, how an initially sour relationship between Dionysius and Hormisdas could have improved over time through Dionysius's eventual capitulation to the views of the victorious Symmachan faction.&lt;ref&gt;Wirbelauer, ''Zwei Päpste'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decretal Collection==

Sometime after preparing his collections of conciliar canons (but still during the pontificate of Symmachus), Dionysius compiled a collection of papal decretals (''Collectio decretalium Dionysiana'') that he dedicated to one 'Priest Julian' (''Iulianus presbyter'').  Whether Dionysius composed this collection at Julianus's request or on his own initiative is not known, as his preface is ambiguous on this point. The collection includes 38 decretals written by popes Siricius, Innocent I, Zosimus, Boniface I, Celestine I, Leo I, Gelasius, and Anastasius II. By far the greater number of decretals were from Innocent I; the reason for this is not certain, but it is possibly explained on the theory that Dionysius had access to a collection of Innocent’s letters that was not found in the papal archives and that had not been available to previous compilers of decretal collections.&lt;ref&gt;D. Jasper, 'The beginning of the decretal tradition: papal letters from the origin of the genre through the pontificate of Stephen V', in ''Papal letters in the early Middle Ages'', eds. Horst Fuhrmann and Detlev Jasper (Washington, D.C., 2001), pp. 3–133, at pp. 35–6.&lt;/ref&gt; While Dionysius's decretal collection would come to be the most important vehicle in the dissemination of late antique papal decretals throughout the early Middle Ages, by no means was it the first nor, at least in Dionysius's lifetime, the most influential. Rather, in the earliest days of the development of decretal collections, several relatively mysterious collections known as the ''Canones urbanici'', the ''Epistolae decretales'', and a third unnamed collection ― one that served as the common source for the ''collectiones Corbeiensis'' and ''Pithouensis''―were in circulation. Dionysius would have been familiar with these collections, and indeed drew on some of them. But the fact that he felt compelled to compile his own collection of papal decretals speaks to his being unhappy with the quality and coverage of other such collections that were available at the time.

==''Collectiones'' combined==
So far as can be known, Dionysius did not package his conciliar and decretal collections together, nor is there any evidence that he intended them to combined. In fact, given the many differences between the collections in terms of genre, themes, tone, style, chronological and geographical coverage, and possibly even jurisdiction — his decretal collection was, after all, 'less oecumenical in its conception than the collection of conciliar decrees'&lt;ref&gt;Firey, 'Collectio Dionysiana', who notes a further distinction: 'The [conciliar collection] represented a finite body of law, for the few councils after Chalcedon considered oecumenical did not issue disciplinary canons until the late eighth century; the [decretal collection], as the additions to the Dionysian collection show, was a more readily expanded and clearly continuing source of legal opinion.'&lt;/ref&gt; — in all likelihood he viewed their creation as entirely separate enterprises with entirely separate end products, intended for dissemination in separate contexts for entirely different uses. Nevertheless, the two collections were eventually joined together by Dionysius's readers to form a combined collection of conciliar and papal decrees. This combined collection of conciliar and decretal canons went on to become widely popular and served as the bedrock for many subsequent variations on Dionysius’s original collections; and it is to versions of such combined collections (rather than the three/four originally separate collections) that modern scholars typically refer when they use the title 'Collectio Dionysiana'.

==Influence and importance==
The Dionysian collections exerted considerable influence on the development of canon law both within Italy and in other parts of Western Europe. In fact, no other Italian collection achieved as much success outside of Italy than did Dionysius's. As mentioned, the collection in its combined form was soon and continually supplemented and augmented, and by the eighth century numerous modified forms could be found throughout the West.

There were gaps in the work of Dionysius; he seems, in particular, to have taken the papal decretals not from the archives of the Roman Church, but from previous compilations, hence certain omissions, which need not arouse any suspicion of the authenticity of documents nor quotes, as to certain catholic apologists. In spite of its defects this collection far surpassed all previous efforts of the kind, not alone by its good order, but also by the clear, intelligible text of its version, and by the importance of its documents. Very soon it superseded all earlier collections and was much used (''celeberimo usu''), especially in the Roman Church, says [[Cassiodorus]]. It became popular in Spain and Africa and even before [[Charlemagne]] had found its way into Gaul and Britain. It was the medium by which the African canons reached the East. Copyists used it to correct the text of the other collections, a fact not to be lost sight of at the risk of taking an interdependence of manuscripts for an interdependence of collections. Despite its authority of daily use and its occasional service in the [[apostolic chancery|papal Chancery]], it never had a truly official character; it even seems that the popes were wont to quote their own decretal letters not from Dionysius, but directly from the papal registers. - In time the "Collectio Dionysiana", as it came to be known, was enlarged and some of these additions entered the "Collectio Hadriana", which [[pope Adrian I]] sent (774) to Charlemagne, and which was received by the bishops of the empire at Aix-la-Chapelle ([[Aachen]]) in 802. It is none other than the "Collectio Dionysiana", with some additions in each of its two parts. In this shape it acquired and kept the title of "Codex Canonum". Neither the action of Pope Adrian nor the acceptance by the Synod of Aix-la-Chapelle conferred on the book an official character, or made it a code of universally obligatory laws; with much greater reason may it be said that it did not thereby become an exclusively authoritative code of ecclesiastical law.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;It was first printed in the first volume of {{harvp|Voel|Justel|1661}}, re-edited by Lepelletier (Paris, 1687), and reprinted in ''Patrologia Latina'' LXVII. A more satisfactory edition is that of [[Cuthbert Hamilton Turner]], in ''Ecclesiæ Occidentalis Monumenta Juris Antiquissima'' (Oxford, 1899-1939), vol. II, fasc. II.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''constitutional history of Colombia''' is the process of formation and evolution of the different [[constitution]]s that [[Colombia]] has had since its formation.

== Pre-Columbian and Spanish times ==

The indigenous nations that inhabited the present territory of Colombia did not have written records; therefore there is no evidence of constitutions prior to the arrival of the [[Spaniards]].

During Colonial times, the Spaniards were supposed to behave according to the [[Laws of Burgos]] of 1512 that defined the rights of the indigenous people but most importantly legalised the right of the Spaniards over them.  These were replaced by the [[New Laws|New Laws of Indies]] of 1542.&lt;ref name=leyesnuevas&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/historia/colonia2/indice.htm Lecturas de Historia Colonial II.  Las leyes nuevas y su promulgación en la Nueva Granada (1542-1550)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Monarchy of Spain]] tried to enforce these laws but revolts by Spaniards that benefited from oppressing the natives forced [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] to suppress them in 1545.&lt;ref name=leyes1&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/diciembre2002/derechos.htm Derechos humanos de los indígenas.  Las instituciones coloniales fallaron en su defensa]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'', translated and published by [[Antonio Nariño]] in 1794 and distributed in [[Santa Fe de Bogotá]], could be considered the first draft of a political constitution in the New World.  At present, the modern version of the ''[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]'' forms the core of the political constitutions of many countries.  The [[Constitution of Canada]], for example, is quite short and is limited almost exclusively to [[human rights]] and basic [[Freedom (political)|freedoms]].  Those rights and liberties were not an integral part of the initial Colombian constitutions, but some were slowly introduced until they were definitively and explicitly included in the [[Colombian Constitution of 1991|Constitution of 1991]].

The first written constitution as such with jurisdiction in Colombia was the [[Spanish Constitution of 1808]].  The [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] also had theoretical jurisdiction during the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista of Spanish America]] until Independence in 1819.

During colonial times, the [[Catholic Church]] was the most powerful institution after the Monarchy of Spain. The Church had control over the press, education, literacy and access to professions.  It was the decisive authority in matters of public and private morality and the government would turn to it to obtain civil servants when laymen were not available.

During the fight for independence, and after, the Church was losing its influence, but it continued take a decisive part in the decision making process.  In particular, the [[federalist]]s wanted to create a constitution without clerical influence, whereas the [[centralists]] leaned towards the Church not only to preserve the faith but as a political body. The minimum geographic area able to send members to the congresses were the [[parish]]es. In larger urban areas there could be several parishes.

==Independence==
At the time of independence from Spain, Colombia was part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] and thus continued to be named until August 10, 1819 when the republican armies arrived in Santa Fe de Bogotá and the Spanish viceroy [[Juan José de Sámano y Uribarri]] fled.

===Memorandum of Offences (Memorial de Agravios): 1809===
[[Image:Camilo Torres.JPG|200 px|thumb|right|Camilo Torres Tenorio]]
In 1809, before the events of the [[Colombian Declaration of Independence]] took place, the [[Cabildo (council)]] of Santa Fe de Bogotá decided it was advisable to send a representative to the [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Junta Suprema Central]] located in [[Seville]].  It commissioned [[Camilo Torres Tenorio]] to draft the document known in Colombian history by the name "[[Memorandum of Offenses]]".  For reasons that are unknown, the Cabildo did not accept this document.&lt;ref name=memorandum&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/historia/julio20/sec2b.htm Proceso histórico del 20 de Julio de 1810 – Seccion 2] Luis Angel Arango Library - Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;  Jose Maria Cárdenas, descendant of Camilo Torres, commented that "the Cabildo was intimidated when shown the representation project and decided to archive it".  On July 20, 1810, Colombia declared independence from Spain.   The "Memorandum of Offences" was kept unpublished until 1832.&lt;ref name="Lievano19"&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/historia/cseiii/cseiii04a.htm Los grandes conflictos de nuestra Historia tomo II; Lievano Aguirre, Indalecio; Chapter XIX; Luis Angel Arango Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the "Memorandum of Offences" did not have any direct political effect and only few people knew of it at the time, its content is useful, more than any other document, to gauge the changes that were taking place in the political climate of Spanish America.  It shows the attitudes that [[Criollo people|Criollos]] (locally born people of pure or mostly Spanish ancestry) had towards assuming a role in the government within the domains of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]]. Some were [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]] and others favored independence. The document demanded the same level of representation for Criollos in the American provinces as that of residents born in Spain (known as [[Peninsulares]]). This demand was based on the claim that Criollos were "descendants of [[Conquistador]]s" and the "legitimate heirs of the Spanish hegemony" which the conquistadors had established over the native populations of America, at whom they looked with some contempt.

===Constitution of Socorro: 1810===
From 1809 to 1830 eight different provinces produced their own independent constitutions so there was not a single unified constitution in the country of Colombia.  The Constitution of the Free State of [[Socorro, Santander|Socorro]] in 1810 was the first of these.  It was simultaneously federalist, democratic, liberal and catholic.&lt;ref name="1810-1849"&gt;[http://sshl.ucsd.edu/collections/las/colombia/1810.html Colombia: Elections and Events 1810-1849] Social Science and Humanities Library of the University of California, San Diego&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lievano22"&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/historia/cseiii/cseiii07.htm Los grandes conflictos de nuestra Historia tomo II; Lievano Aguirre, Indalecio; Chapter XXII; Luis Angel Arango Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

Socorro was the capital of the province of [[Santander Department|Santander]] at the time, where 30 years before the second [[Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada)|Revolt of the Comuneros]] took place.

===Constitution of Cundinamarca: 1811===
After the Colombian Declaration of Independence, the Junta (Meeting) of August 20, 1810 was created.  [[Jose Miguel Pey de Andrade]] was appointed head of the Meeting, which makes him the first Chief of State.

The '''Constituent Electoral College of the State of Cundinamarca''' can be considered the first Constituent National Assembly and Congress. It met in Santa Fe de Bogotá in March 1811 and, with many difficulties due to disagreements between centralists and federalists, promulgated the first constitution with national scope: '''The Constitution of the state of Cundinamarca''' on April 4, 1811.  The document was inspired by the [[United States Constitution]].  The assembly appointed the second Chief of State, [[Jorge Tadeo Lozano]], for a period of three years. Because of internal pressures and frays, the assembly forced him to resign on September 19, 1811 and chose [[Antonio Nariño]] instead.&lt;ref name="1810-1849"/&gt;

===United Provinces: 1811===
By the end of 1810, other constitutions had arisen in different urban centres like [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Tunja]], [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Mariquita, Tolima|Mariquita]] and [[Neiva, Colombia|Neiva]].  Some of these (Cartagena, Tunja, Antioquia, [[Casanare Department|Casanare]], [[Pamplona]] and [[Popayán]]) sent representatives to '''The Congress of the United Provinces''' that met initially in Santa Fe de Bogotá and later in Tunja and [[Villa de Leyva]].

On the second Sunday of October 1811 the first elections were held in Tunja.  For each 2000 inhabitants there was a representing elector, and one for each municipality even if it did not have a population of this size.  Any man 20 years old or older or anybody 15 or older and with "a modest occupation" could vote.  The first name for the republic was established officially on November 27: [[United Provinces of New Granada]].&lt;ref name="1810-1849"/&gt;

The '''Constituent Electoral College of the State of Cundinamarca''' elected [[Pedro Groot]] as its first president on December 23, and the following day Antonio Nariño as acting president.  At the meeting of October 4, 1812, the United Provinces elected Camilo Torres Tenorio as president (a position he held until October 5, 1814) and declared the union to be federalist as opposed to centralist.  [[Simón Bolivar]] and Antonio Nariño were in favor of centralism, which was also becoming more popular in Santa Fe de Bogotá.  This disagreement threw the United Provinces into an armed confrontation at the end of 1812, and a second one, without Nariño, in 1814.&lt;ref name="1810-1816"&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/historia/primera/santafe1.htm Hechos y Gentes de la primera Republica Colombiana (1810-1816)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908211328/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/historia/primera/santafe1.htm |date=September 8, 2007 }} Luis Angel Arango Library – Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Federalists (partisans of [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], who saw centralism as a restriction of freedom) would later evolve into the [[Liberal Party of Colombia]].  Centralists (partisans of Antonio Nariño and Simón Bolívar, who wanted to see the nation centralized) would evolve into the [[Colombian Conservative Party]].

Once Ferdinand VII recovered from the [[Peninsular War]], royal forces led by [[Pablo Morillo]] defeated the revolutionary forces.  In August, September and October 1816 Morillo executed most constitutional leaders, including Camilo Torres, and restored the [[Real Audencia]] in Santa Fe de Bogotá in March 1817.&lt;ref name="1810-1849"/&gt;

Nariño was arrested in [[Pasto]] in May 1814 and imprisoned in Spain.  He remained so until 1821.&lt;ref name="1810-1849"/&gt;

==The Gran Colombia==

===Congress of Angostura===
{{Main article | Congress of Angostura}}

Although in 1819 some large areas were still under Spanish control, the urge for independence energised the political climate.  On February 15, 1819, six months before the [[Battle of Boyacá]], representatives of '''Venezuela''' (now [[Venezuela]]), '''New Granada''' (now Colombia and [[Panama]]) and '''Quito''' (now [[Ecuador]]) met in [[Ciudad Bolívar|Angostura]], Venezuela.  This meeting, called the [[Congress of Angostura]], worked on the development of a "Fundamental Law" (constitution).  Representatives from Quito were few since that province was still under Spanish control.
[[Image:Simon Bolivar.jpg|200 px|right|thumb|Simón Bolivar fought for the independence of several South American countries.]]
These were the decisions taken initially:
* New Granada was renamed '''Cundinamarca ''' and its capital '''Santa Fe de Bogotá''' renamed '''Bogotá'''.  The Capital of the province of Quito would be the city of [[Quito]].  The Capital of Venezuela would be [[Caracas]].  The capital of Colombia would be Bogotá.
* The '''Republic of Colombia''' was created.  In order to differentiate this period from present [[Republic of Colombia]], historians have customarily called it [[Gran Colombia]].
*The Republic would be governed by a president. There would be a vice president who would replace the president in his absence.
* The governors of the three Departments would also be called Vice Presidents.
* The presidents and vice-presidents would be elected with an indirect vote, but in the interim, the Congress chose them, as follows: President of the Republic: [[Simón Bolivar]], Vice President of the Republic: [[Francisco Antonio Zea]], Vice President of Cundinamarca: [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], and Vice President of Venezuela: [[Juan Germán Roscio]]. The office of Vice President of Quito was left vacant as Quito was still under Spanish control.  In August, Bolivar continued his mission of liberation and left for Ecuador and Peru, with Santander remaining in charge of the country.
*Bolivar was given the title of "Liberator" and his picture with the motto "Bolivar, Liberator of Colombia and father of the Motherland" was exhibited in the congress assembly hall.

After the [[Vargas Swamp Battle|Battle of the Marsh of Vargas]] and the Battle of Boyacá, on December 17, 1819 the Congress of Angostura declared the Republic of Colombia formally created.

At the end of the sessions the Congress decided that it would meet again in [[Cúcuta]], in January 1821, in order to publish the new constitution.

During his six years in captivity, Antonio Nariño had drafted a constitution.  After '' The Precursor'' was released in Spain on March 23, 1820 he presented his constitution in Cúcuta, but he did not get much attention.

===Congress of Cúcuta: 1821===
{{main article | Constitution of Cúcuta}}

The [[Congress of Cúcuta|Congress]] defined in Angostura met this time in [[Villa del Rosario, Norte de Santander|Villa del Rosario]], in Cúcuta, in the beginning of 1821.

The [[Battle of Carabobo]], on June 24, 1821, officially brought independence to Venezuela and on July 18 the Congress restarted with greater impetus in Cúcuta to include the regions recently liberated: Caracas, [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Popayán]] and [[Santa Marta]].

The '''[[Constitution of Cúcuta]]''' was proclaimed on August 30, 1821 and published on July 12.  This has been considered the first Constitution of Colombia that was effective in Gran Colombia until its dissolution in 1831.  It consisted of 10 chapters and 91 articles, but the most important points are:&lt;ref name=cucuta&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/historia/vireco/vireco11.htm "El viaje de Gaspard-Théodore Mollien por la República de Colombia en 1823" - Chapter IX] Luis Angel Arango Library – Virtual Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

* It promulgated the progressive emancipation of slaves: the children of enslaved parents would be free at age 18.  It also created a fund to ensure that released slaves would have means to subsist.  The fund was collected from a percentage of inheritances that varied from 0.15% to 10%.  This happened 42 years before slavery was abolished in  United States.
* It ended the [[Inquisition]] and made reforms regarding bishops, archbishops and church property.
* The Government of Colombia was declared popular and representative.
* It confirmed the division into three great departments: Cundinamarca, Venezuela and Quito.  These departments were divided in 7 normal departments (not counting Panama and Quito; their fate was still in the future); three of Venezuela: Orinoco, Venezuela and Zulia, and four of Cundinamarca: Bogotá, Cundinamarca, Cauca and Magdalena.  Each '''departament''' was divided into '''provinces''', the provinces into ''' cantons''', cantons into '''cabildos''' and '''municipalities''', and then into '''parishes'''.  Venezuela consisted of ten provinces, Cundinamarca thirteen (to which the two Panamanian provinces would later be added), and Quito had seven provinces.
* Each parish would have an Assembly that would meet the last Sunday of July every four years.  The members of these Assemblies would designate the voters of the cantons. Voters were required to be 25 years old and should have more than 500 [[piastre|piastras]] in real estate or 300 in rent.
* Men age 21 or older with one hundred piastras (or an equivalent income from an occupation) and who (after 1840) knew how to read and write could also vote.
* These would constitute the provincial Assembly of voters who would meet the first day of October every four years, in order to elect the president and vice-president of the Republic, the senator of the Department and the representative or representatives of the province.  These departmental civic employees would serve terms of four years.
* The Congress would be formed by two chambers: the Senate and the chamber of Representatives.  The senators would be appointed for a period of eight years and the representatives for a period of four years.
* Each department would have 4 senators: two for eight years and two for four-year terms.  These differences were incorporated with the aim of renewing the Senate every four years.
* Senators should be 30 years old, Criollo by birth, have real estate worth 4000 piastras or a rent of 500 piastras per year, and practising a liberal profession.  Foreigners were also allowed to be senators if they had been established in the country for twelve years and owned real estate worth 16000 piastras.
* The Chamber of Representatives would be made up of Deputies: one per 30,000 inhabitants.
* Delegates must be 25 and possess property worth 2000 piastras or a rent of 500 piastras, or be a professional.  It was necessary to reside in the country two years before election.  Foreigners had a residence requirement of  eight years and had to have real estate worth 10000 piastras.
* The House of Representatives would have the exclusive faculty to accuse the president, the vice-president and the ministers of the High Court of Justice before the Senate.
* The Constitution established that sessions of both chambers be public; that the main civil servants be excluded from legislative functions; that their members enjoy immunity during their term, and that they receive pay.
* The Executive authority was to consist of a president and a vice-president, chosen for 4 years, who could not be re-elected and who, in case of death, would be replaced by the president of the Senate.  The president would have a pay of 30000 piastras per year, and the vice-president 16000.
* Each department would be administered by an [[intendant]] and a [[governor]], the former appointed by the president and the latter under the orders of the intendant.
* It established the positions of ministers, council, and supreme court, and regulated each position.
* The Congress chose Simón Bolivar by vote as president and Francisco de Paula Santander as vice-president, but since Bolivar was absent Santander took the presidency and Nariño the vice-presidency.

On May 24, 1822 the province of Quito sealed its independence in the [[Battle of Pichincha]]; and on December 9, 1824 the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] sealed Peru's (what today is [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]]).  Peru and Bolivia never formed part of the Gran Colombia but they share with Ecuador, Venezuela and Colombia the title of '''Bolivarian Countries''', being republics liberated by Simón Bolivar, to whom the congress bestowed the title of ''Libertador'', and was considered the first official president of each of them.

===Separation of Ecuador and Venezuela: 1830===
The issue that initiated the separation of Venezuela and Quito from the Gran Colombia was the difference of opinions between federalists and centralists.  Quito did not have a real representation in the constitutional deliberations and it was not until 1822 that joined the Gran Colombia.  In spite of support for the constitution in Quito, and more specifically in [[Guayaquil]], the people of Venezuela and Quito longed for a federalist constitution, one that would allow them to have regional freedom and control without strong central impositions.  The Venezuelan military, in particular, wanted to exert more power in their region.

The members of the army had been allowed to vote in the elections since the constitution of Cúcuta in recognition of their efforts in the liberation. In 1827 the congress decided to reduce that right and made a constitutional change to exclude the ranks below sergeants, since excluding higher ranks was considered too bold.

In April 1828 the representatives of the municipalities (parishes) met in [[Ocaña, Norte de Santander|Ocaña]] to choose the constituent congress that would reform the constitution of Cúcuta.  The Santanderists (federalists) formed a large contingent.  The displeasure of the Bolivarians (centralists) was such that they decided to leave the deliberations, thus not allowing a quorum to be obtained.  This unwillingness to behave democratically and solve problems with dialogue, negotiation and vote, deciding on abandonment of the process instead, was a behavior that the political parties of Colombia would maintain during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and it would generate violence.  Nevertheless, the members in the elections of July 1, 1828 were appointed.

Bolivar was eager to see Colombia united and decided to impose his will in a dictatorial fashion as a last resort.  In August 1828, he presented a constitution in which he included Peru and Bolivia (by then, Bolivia had already separated from Peru), with a strong central government and a presidency for life in which the president could have the faculty to appoint his successor.  That was the final spark that set afire the Santanderistas because they saw in that proposal a backward movement towards monarchy; on September 25 there was an assassination attempt on Bolivar. The leaders of Venezuela saw Bolivar's intentions with enough distrust that in November 1829 they decided to separate from Colombia. They let this be known at the convention of January 1829.  Bolivar finally resigned his position during the constitutional convention in January 1830 held in Bogotá (also called ''the Admirable Congress''); his health was starting to fail.

The Inhabitants of Quito, knowing that Venezuela had separated and that Bolivar was retired, decided to separate as well.  Thus The Gran Colombia vanished after 11 years of existence.

The displeasure of military and liberal groups was accentuated and General [[Rafael Urdaneta]]'s dictatorship ensued. Finally in December 1830 Simón Bolivar ''the liberator'' died.

===The Admirable Congress and the Constitution of 1830===
Trying to avoid the separation of Ecuador and Venezuela, the Admirable Congress (named thus due to the highly regarded people who formed it) worked on the Constitution of 1830, limiting centralism and giving the regions and municipalities more power.  The separation came before this constitution could be in effect, but would become a model for following constitutions since it had a moderate and conciliatory tone.&lt;ref name="urdaneta"&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/biografias/urdarafa.htm LÓPEZ OCAMPO, Javier; Rafael Urdaneta; 2004-12-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The constitution of 1832: Republic of New Granada==
The Gran Colombia (without Venezuela and Ecuador) consisted of Panama, Magdalena, Boyacá, Cundinamarca and the Cauca, and these departments were subdivided into about 15 provinces.  On October 20, 1831 the '''Granadine Convention''' approved the separation and established a centralized republic officially called ''' [[Republic of New Granada]]''' with some federal characteristics.  The constitution established a [[presidentialist]] regime.  The congress appointed [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] president for a period of four years.  On November 17, 1831 the Fundamental Law was promulgated, but the Congress continued working on it throughout 1832.  The term for senators was reduced form eight to four years and that of representatives from four to two.  Provinces, now called Departments, were granted greater representation and power, and were administered by a governor and the assemblies.  The former was appointed by the president and the latter chosen by vote.  Centralists and the Catholic Church began to be called "Conservatives" and their opponents, the federalists, "Liberals".

===The Reform of 1843===
The country had gone through the [[War of the Convents]] and [[War of the Supremes]] from 1839 to 1841 so during the presidency of General [[Pedro Alcántara Herrán]] the Congress strengthened the office of president to an authoritarian and centralist extent with the purpose of keeping the national territory in order, something that Conservatism, being the ruling party, used to its advantage.

This reform eliminated the free press, gave the Catholic Church a monopoly over education and allowed the [[Jesuits]], who had been expelled, to return.

Between 1849 and 1853 the number of provinces, now renamed departments, increased from 22 to 36.

===The Reform of 1853===
The constitution of 1832 leaned towards liberalism with the Reform of 1853.  Now federalism prevailed; slavery was eliminated; the suffrage was extended to all men aged 21 and older; the direct popular vote to choose congressmen governors and magistrates was implemented; administrative and religious freedom were established; the State separated from the Church, and the juristic power of the Catholic Church was terminated.  Some of these reforms were reverted later in the 1886 constitution.

Elections to choose the solicitor and the Supreme Court of Justice took place in September 1853.  On October 3, 1853 the governor of Bogotá was chosen, counting the votes by parochial district.

During 1848 and 1849 the traditional parties, Liberal and Conservative, finally coined their names.  Their ideological differences became solid and the emphasis on personal characters waned.

As of 1849, during the government of General [[José Hilario López]] the country began a strong political and economic transformation because of the shift from colonialism towards capitalism.

==The constitution of 1858: Granadine Confederation==
Under the mandate of the conservative [[Mariano Ospina Rodríguez]], the country was officially renamed [[Granadine Confederation]] in this constitution.  The confederation was formed by eight states. The provinces were granted greater representation and power: each state could have independent legislative attributes and the possibility of choosing its own president.

The vice-presidency was abolished and it was replaced with one designate appointed by the Congress.  The president and senators would be elected for a period of 4 years and the chamber for 2.

In 1859 an electoral law conferred the president of the confederation the power to replace state presidents and to take part in questions of public order, and conferred the upon Congress the right to judge the elections of the states.

==The constitution of 1863: United States of Colombia==
[[Image:Rionegro Constitution.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Constitution of 1863, also known as the [[Rionegro Constitution]]]]
The radical liberals had won the [[Colombian Civil War (1860–1862)]], and created the [[Constitution of Rionegro]] promulgated on May 8, 1863.

On February 3, 1863 Congress approved the name '''[[United States of Colombia]]''' for the country{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}.

The new constitution liberalized social and economic policies, proclaiming the freedom to express one's ideas orally or in written form; freedom to work or to organize any business; freedom of the press; freedom to travel through the territory; to enter or to leave it; freedom of education, freedom of religion, freedom of association, and freedom to possess arms and ammunition.

It established a federal system with a central presidency (presidency of the union){{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} for two years and without the possibility of immediate re-election.  The election of the president of the union was indirect: each one of ''' the Nine States''' (Panama, Antioquia, Magdalena, Bolivar, Santander, Boyacá, Cundinamarca, Tolima and the Cauca) would choose their candidates following particular electoral procedures for each state; then, each one of the nine states would deposit a vote to elect the president of the union.  The winning candidate was that who had the absolute majority of votes; if an absolute majority was not obtained, the Congress would choose him from the same group of candidates.

Under this decentralized regime, regionalistic feelings reached their ultimate expression{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}.

On May 12, four days after having proclaimed the constitution, the 61 delegates chose [[Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera]] to govern for two years until April 1, 1864, the moment at which the new regulations to name a president would start.  Mosquera had the anticlerical tone of liberalism, and the conservatives a pro-clerical tone that would continue for many decades.

===The Reform of 1876===
This federal period produced forty two new state constitutions and before 1876 elections were almost continuous, since the different states did not vote simultaneously, not even for the election of the president of the union.  Therefore, a constitutional change was implemented so that the elections for president of each state were made at the same time in all the states.

==The constitution of 1886: Republic of Colombia==

{{main article|Colombian Constitution of 1886}}
{{wikisource|Constitución de Colombia de 1886}}

The coalition of moderate Liberals and Conservatives that ended the liberal hegemony and placed [[Rafael Núñez (politician)|Rafael Núñez]] in power, repealed the Constitution of Rionegro with the Constitution of 1886.  From now on, the country was officially called the '''[[Colombia|Republic of Colombia]]'''.

The Constituent Assembly consisted of 18 delegates, two from each of the nine states.
[[Image:Rafael Núñez 1.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Rafael Núñez, Colombian politician, 1885.]] 
Rafael Núñez announced a national '''Regeneration''' program and changed the country from a decentralized federal system to a centralized system with a strong central presidency.  The presidential period changed from two to six years.  The president of the Republic was elected by the Congress.  The president of the state was appointed governor who from that moment on was appointed by the president of the Republic.  The governor would choose the mayors of his department, except the mayor of Bogotá who was chosen by the president himself.  Thus the president in effect had control of the executive at all levels.

The re-election of the president in immediately subsequent periods was authorized.

The chamber, the departmental assemblies and the municipal councils were chosen by popular vote.  The Senate was chosen by the departmental assemblies.  The suffrage for elections of national scope was limited to literate men over the age of 21.  The restriction of knowing how to read and to write did not apply in regional elections.

The position of the vice-president was reinstated, and initially occupied by [[Eliseo Payán]].

The [[Colombian Constitution of 1886]] remained in effect for more than one hundred years, guiding the mandate of twenty-three presidents of the Republic.

===Separation of Panama: 1903===

{{main article|Panama–Colombia separation}}

On November 3, 1903 [[Panama]] separated from Colombia with support from the United States.  On November 6 the United States recognized the sovereignty of Panama.  On November 11 the United States informed Colombia they would oppose any Colombian troops trying to recover Panama.  The [[Thousand Days' War]] had left Colombia too weak to prevent the separation.  On November 18 the United States signed the [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]] with Panama for the construction of the [[Panama Canal]].

===The Reform of 1905===
In December 1904, few months after being elected president, General [[Rafael Reyes]], displeased because of their  slowness in approving reforms he wanted to impose, closed the Congress. At the beginning of 1905 he summoned a National Constituent Assembly chosen by the departmental administrators.

The Assembly suppressed the vice-presidency, two of the designaturas and the Council of State. It also dedided that the magistrates of the Supreme Court of Justice would serve for life, recognized the right of representation of minorities and the possibility to reform the Constitution by means of the National Assembly.&lt;ref name="Rios"/&gt;

The National Assembly demonstrated its support to the government with a dictatorial character when it established a presidential period of 10 years for General Reyes with the possibility for him to appoint his own successor. In&lt;ref name="Rios"&gt;[http://lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/enero1991/enero1.htm Rios Peñalosa, Gilma; Las constituyentes de 1905 y 1910; Revista Credencial; 2005-05-17]
&lt;/ref&gt; However General Reyes quit in 1909.

===The Reform of 1910===
[[Image:Carlos Eugenio Restrepo Restrepo.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Carlos Eugenio Restrepo]]
After the overthrow and exile of General Rafael Reyes on June 13, 1909, the Congress chose the vice-president, [[Ramón González Valencia]], to govern the remaining year in Reyes' term.

Ramon González summoned a National Assembly in 1910 to reform the [[Colombian Constitution of 1886]].  This important reform  banned the participation of the military in politics, established the direct popular election of the president of the republic, departmental assemblies and municipal council; it reduced the presidential period from 6 to 4 years, prohibited the immediate re-election of presidents, eliminated the position of vice-president and replaced it with one appointee that would be chosen by the congress; it established a system of proportions for the appointment of the members of public corporations according to the votes obtained, assuring a minimum of one third for the opposition party; it granted the congress the right to choose the magistrates of the Supreme Court of Justice, consecrated the constitutional control to the Supreme Court of Justice.

The president kept the power to name governors who in turn would appoint mayors, [[Corregidor (position)|corregidores]], administrators, directors of post offices, heads of jails, managers of banks, and some others.

The Constituent National Assembly appointed [[Carlos Eugenio Restrepo]] to be the first president of the Republican Union on July 15.

===The Reform of 1936===
During the government of [[Alfonso López Pumarejo]], on August 1, 1936 the congress made several reforms.  The right of suffrage was extended to all men 21 or older, eliminating the literacy requirement.

===The Reform of 1954===
During the government of [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]] and by his suggestion, The National Constituent Assembly  unanimously recognized the voting rights of women on August 25, 1954.  Women exerted this right for the first time during the plebiscite of December 1, 1957.

===The Reform of 1957===
In October 1957 the temporary Military Junta that succeeded Rojas Pinilla authorized legislation with the stated purpose of finding a solution to the problems of the country. This agreement and the corresponding period was called [[National Front (Colombia)|National Front]].

A [[Colombian constitutional reform referendum, 1957|referendum]] held on 1 December 1957 approved the constitutional reform giving parity to both traditional parties for a term of 12 years. It was determined that the elections for President of the Republic, Congress, Departmental Assemblies, and Municipal Councils would take place during the first semester of 1958.

===The Reform of 1958===
The first Congress elected by popular means within the National Front extended the term of the National Front from 12 to 16 years, and decided in addition that the first president would be liberal and not conservative.

===The Reform of 1968===
Although the National Front ended in 1974, the constitutional reforms preparing the transition began in 1968 during the government of [[Carlos Lleras Restrepo]], the next to last president of the National Front.

With the purpose of regulating the electoral competition between parties, the reforms eliminated the distribution by halves for departmental assemblies and municipal councils. Also included were some measures to recognize minority parties. Some required reforms were postponed, in some cases indefinitely, such Article 120 of the Constitution granting "the right and fair participation of the second party in voting". Article 120 had the unintended effect of limiting the participation of minority parties and therefore limiting citizen participation.

===The Reform of 1984===
During the government of [[Belisario Betancur]] the congress established popular voting for mayors and governors on November 21, 1984.

==The constitution of 1991==
{{main article | Colombian Constitution of 1991}}

During peace negotiations with various rebel groups during the mandate of president [[Virgilio Barco Vargas]], the guerrilla detachment [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] insisted that one of the main requirements for them to lay down arms was the creation of a [[Constituent Assembly of Colombia]] in order to modify the constitution which until then did not guarantee the creation and development of political parties other than the two traditional ones, nor give representation to minorities.

The government initially refused to put in motion the process for constitutional change. Students, in particular those at the universities, decided to begin a national popular movement proposing the formation of a Constituent National Assembly to resolve the constitutional issue.  More than 50% of the voters approved the "Seventh Paper Ballot" and president [[César Gaviria Trujillo]] was forced by the Supreme Court to fulfill the popular mandate.  Thus it was possible not only to obtain constitutional change, but also the guerrilla detachment M-19 laid down their arms and were integrated into the national political life, and the indigenous communities were henceforth  guaranteed representation in Congress.

The Constitution of 1991 is called ''' the Constitution of the Rights''', as it recognizes and consecrates  fundamental rights such as freedom of religion and freedom of expression. It also details economic and social rights specific to the social rule of law enshrined in Article 1 of the Constitution, and collective rights, some of which include public morality, free economic competition and the right to a healthy environment. In addition it creates the necessary mechanisms to ensure and protect those rights.

The student and political movement begun in 1989 resulted in 1990 in a Constituent Assembly of Colombia elected by direct popular vote, which one year later promulgated the Colombian Constitution of 1991 in Bogotá.  The country kept the name "Republic of Colombia".

===The Reform of 2005===
In 2004, president [[Álvaro Uribe]] from the independent party [[Colombia First]] proposed a constitutional reform to allow the re-election of the President in immediately subsequent periods.  The proposal was approved according to the constitution procedures and the Constitutional Court declared it executable as of October 19, 2005.  The first reelected president was Álvaro Uribe himself on May 28, 2006, obtaining a voting of 62.1%.  Next in the polls was [[Carlos Gaviria Díaz]], a candidate for the leftist party [[Alternative Democratic Pole]], who obtained 22% of the vote.

The fact that Uribe and Gaviria were from independent parties highlights that an important era of ideological transformation occurred in the history of Colombia, even to the point where some mass media announced that bipartisanism had been fatally wounded.

It is also evident that a level of maturity had been reached in the electoral process, which had earned the confidence of the population and of opposition parties.  The speed of the delivery of electoral data from the National Registration Office was also outstanding, as even observers abroad knew the results of 85% of the ballots before two hours had elapsed since the ballot boxes had closed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10268">Various '''copyright alternatives''' in an '''alternative compensation systems''' ('''ACS''') have been proposed as ways to allow the widespread reproduction of digital [[copyright]]ed works while still paying the authors and copyright owners of those works. This article only discusses those proposals which involve some form of [[government intervention]]. Other models, such as the [[street performer protocol]] or [[voluntary collective license]]s, could arguably be called "alternative compensation systems" although they are very different and generally less effective at solving the [[free rider problem]].

The impetus for these proposals has come from the widespread use of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] networks. A few authors argue that an ACS is simply the only practical response to the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Gervais, D. "The Price of Social Norms: Towards a Liability Regime for File Sharing", 12 Journal of Intellectual Property Law 39, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; But most ACS advocates go further, holding that P2P file sharing is in fact greatly beneficial, and that tax or levy funded systems are actually more desirable tools for paying artists 
than sales coupled with [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]] copy prevention technologies.

==Artistic freedom voucher==
The artistic freedom voucher (AFV) proposal argues that the current copyright system providing a state enforced monopoly leads to "enormous inefficiencies and creates substantial enforcement problems". Under the AFV proposed system, individuals would be allowed to contribute a refundable tax credit of approximately $100 to a "creative worker", this contribution would act as a voucher that can only be used to support artistic or creative work.

Recipients of the AFV contribution would in turn be required to register with the government in similar fashion to that of religious or charitable institutions do so for tax-exempt status. The sole purpose of the registration would be to prevent fraud and would have no evaluation of the quality or work being produced. Alongside registration, artists would also now be ineligible for copyright protection for a set period of time (5 years for example) as the work is contributed to the public domain and allowed to be freely reproduced. The AFV would not affect creative workers ability to receive funds via live performances.

Proponents claim that this system could create up to $20 billion annually to pay artists, which is far greater than what currently flows to them through copyrighted material. At $100 per adult voucher, over 500,000 writers, musicians, singers, actors, or other creative workers could be paid some $40,000 a year. Baker also states that it is realistic to assume that the savings from the reduced expenditures on the copyrighted work would vastly exceed the cost of the AFV. The majority of these savings would come from individuals deciding to use AFV supported work in place of copyrighted work as well as lower advertising costs because the AFV material would be public domain. Copyright enforcement demand would also decrease as AFV material increased. The assumptions made are that in the low end direct costs to the public of copyrighted material would be reduced around 20 percent while in the high end all the way up to 60 percent. Over time it is also likely that the savings would increase due to the lesser costs of the system and brighter prospects.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, D. [http://www.cepr.net/publications/reports/the-artistic-freedom-voucher-internet-age-alternative-to-copyrights The Artistic Freedom Voucher: Internet Age Alternative to Copyrights] 2003. [http://www.cato-unbound.org/2008/11/20/dean-baker/artistic-freedom-vouchers/ "Related Views"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 article critical of the AFV proposal, graphic designer Mark Stanley writes:

"Like school vouchers, the flat tax, and other pretenders, the AFV assumes the necessity of state intervention, and tries to bend liberty around such strictures. Freedom isn’t so forgiving to such manipulation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/daily/author/1475J ,Mark Stanley], [https://mises.org/daily/4269 The False Freedom of Art Vouchers]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donation-based record labels===
While the systematic restructuring of copyright laws proposed by AFV is far from being put into practice, the concept of paying artists with donations has been tested, with some success. In 2006, musician Jeff Rosenstock founded [[Quote Unquote Records]], which advertised itself as the first donation-based record label. Artists on this label make their music available to download for free, and invite listeners to make a small donation if they want to. Between donations and ticket sales for live shows, Quote Unquote Records has been successfully recording music and expanding the number of bands on their label for the past twelve years.

==Architectural details==

===Where does the money come from===
Proposals have included targeted levies on internet connections, blank CDs, digital media players, etc. (many of these goods are levied various countries' existing [[private copying schemes]]); income taxation; or optional payments by users.

In terms of economic theory, consumer "opt in" regimes are very different from universal ones, but depending on how the scheme was administered, the differences might not be so large. For example, if the default option for ISP subscribers was to pay an ACS surcharge, which could be avoided by filing a signed commitment not to make unauthorised downloads from P2P networks, the effects might be quite similar. This scheme however is unsuitable for business owners who maintain free internet connections as incentive for customers. It would then be the responsibility of the business owner to monitor his or her customer's internet use.

===Where does it go===
Various proposals have been made to base the distribution of royalties on measures of consumer downloading, usage or voting.

The computer security issues to be addressed in collecting this data are considerable. The privacy and verifiability obstacles are very similar to those encountered in [[Internet voting]]; they may be soluble, but only with hardware assistance not currently available on ordinary PCs. The most practical way to deploy an ACS in the short term would be to collect [[statistical sampling|statistical samples]] from a much smaller population.

The actual distribution of royalties would likely be carried out by a copyright [[collecting society]].

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Alternative compensation systems have two very significant advantages over digital copyright. They do not impose artificial scarcity on copyright works: everyone can download as many songs, ebooks and films as they want (in economic terns, ACS eliminate the [[deadweight loss]] of copyright monopolies). They also avoid the very high technological and [[Elektra v. Santangelo|social]] costs of digital [[copyright enforcement]].

The two greatest drawbacks of ACSes are the [[excess burden of taxation|excess burden]] of the taxation that is collected, and the need to decide what tax/levy rates to use for the system (although methods such as [[contingent valuation]] may help a little with that question).

==Alternative compensation systems in practice==
Canada's [[private copying levy]] had the unforeseen result of temporarily creating an ACS for some kinds of P2P downloading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cb-cda.gc.ca/tariffs/certified/c13122003-b.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617073712/http://www.cb-cda.gc.ca/tariffs/certified/c13122003-b.pdf |archivedate=2006-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[BMG v. Doe]], a ''[[dictum]]'' suggested that this should also apply to uploading; but the dictum was criticised on appeal.

In France, the December 2005 [[DADVSI]] amendments that were passed by the [[French Senate|Senate]] would have created an ACS called a "global license". These amendments were removed before the bill finally became law.

In 2009, the German [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] added a proposal for an ACS variant called a "cultural flat-rate" to its party platform.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/2009/05/11/the-world-is-going-flat-rate/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Quartex.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cracktro for the cracking group Quartex on [[Amiga]]. A typical crack intro has a text running at the bottom of the screen.]]
A '''crack intro''', also known as a '''cracktro''', '''loader''', or just '''intro''', is a small introduction sequence added to [[Software cracking|cracked software]]. It aims to inform the user which "cracking crew" or individual cracker removed the software's [[copy protection]] and distributed the crack.&lt;ref name="EuroGamer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="0dayartTheVerge"/&gt;

They first appeared on [[Apple II]] computer in the late 1970s or early 1980s&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jason_scott_2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reunanen2010" /&gt;, and then on [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] games that were distributed around the world via [[Bulletin Board System]]s (BBSes) and [[floppy disk]] copying.&lt;ref name="reunanen2010"/&gt; Even the commercially available [[ISEPIC]] cartridge, which produced [[memory dump]]s of copy-protected Commodore 64 software, added a custom crack intro to the snapshots it produced.&lt;ref name="kevelson198510"/&gt; Early crack intros resemble [[graffiti]] in many ways, although they invaded the [[private sphere]] and not the public space.&lt;ref name="carlsson2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kotlinski2009" /&gt;

As time went on, crack intros became a medium to demonstrate the purported superiority of a cracking group.&lt;ref name="jason_scott_2010" /&gt; Such intros grew very complex, sometimes exceeding the size&lt;ref name="arstechnica2013" /&gt; and complexity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalekultur.org/files/dk_whatisthedemoscene.pdf|title=The Demoscene|publisher=Digitale Kultur e.V.|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-10-25}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date= June 2015}} of the software itself. Crack intros only became more sophisticated on more advanced systems such as the [[Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], and some [[IBM PC]] clone systems with sound cards.&lt;ref name="reunanen2010" /&gt; These intros feature big, colourful [[2D computer graphics|effects]],[[chiptune| music]], and [[Scrolling#Demos|scrollers]].&lt;ref name="demographics" /&gt;&lt;!-- 4:12+ --&gt; 

Cracking groups would use the intros not just to gain credit for cracking, but to advertise their BBSes, greet friends, and gain themselves recognition.&lt;ref name="jason_scott_2010" /&gt; Messages were frequently of a vulgar nature, and on some occasions made threats of violence against software companies or the members of some rival crack-group.&lt;ref name="jason_scott_2010" /&gt;

Crack-intro programming eventually became an art form in its own right, and people started coding intros without attaching them to a crack just to show off how well they could program. This practice evolved into the [[demoscene]].&lt;ref name="EuroGamer"/&gt;

Crack intros that use [[chiptune]]s live on {{as of|2018|lc=y}} in the form of background music for small programs intended to remove the software protection on commercial and shareware software that has limited or dumbed-down capabilities. Sometimes this is simply in the form of a program that generates a software package's serial number, usually referred to as a [[keygen]]. These chiptunes are now still accessible as downloadable ''[[Module file#Music disk|musicdisks]]'' or ''musicpacks''.&lt;ref name="chiptunes2009"/&gt;

'''Critical animal studies''' ('''CAS''') is an interdisciplinary scientific field and theory-to-activism global community, which originated at the beginning of the 21st century. The core interest of CAS is [[Animal ethics|ethical reflection on relations between people and other animals]], firmly grounded in [[intersectionality]] and [[anarchism]]. Its aim is to integrate academic research with political engagement and activism. As it overlaps with a number of other disciplines, CAS includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, as well as animal rights activists.

== History ==
CAS traces its history back to critical social movements of the 1960s and 70s, which is when ecological and animal questions entered the academic debate. It was also the time when the first [[Animal rights movement|animal liberation movements]], Band of Mercy and [[Animal Liberation Front]], emerged. While CAS can be considered as a direct continuation of those movements, its institutional history began no earlier than in 2001 when the Centre for Animal Liberation Affairs (CALA) was established by Anthony J. Nocella II and Steve Best. CALA was created as a direct consequence of an anthology entitled "Terrorists or Freedom Fighters? Reflections on the Liberation of Animals", edited by Best and Nocella. This book was the first comprehensive publication devoted to the history, ethics and tactics of the Animal Liberation Front, viewed from both activist and academic perspective. Over the following years CALA conducted research on issues related to animal exploitation, provided education, analysis and advised on policy. Two major initiatives of this institution were the annual Animal Liberation Philosophy and Policy Conference and the founding of the ''Animal Liberation Philosophy and Policy Journal'' which was later renamed as the ''Journal for Critical Animal Studies''. The name of the movement (CAS) emerged in 2006, as a consequence of long term discussions among activists and scholars who collaborated with CALA. At the end of 2006, CALA changed its name to the Institute for Critical Animal Studies (ICAS).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.criticalanimalstudies.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, ICAS is a private organization run by a Board of Executive Directors, who are responsible for making major decisions concerning its mission, strategic plans and principles. Since 2011 the institution has been an international network, with branches in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Oceania. It has since established a series of initiatives, such as the Students for Critical Animal Studies, the Intersectional Research Collective, the Annual Tilikum Awards and the Revista Latinoamericana de Estudios Críticos Animales (''Spanish Journal for Critical Animal Studies''). In 2014 ICAS published and edited volume entitled "Defining Critical Animal Studies: An Intersectional Social Justice Approach for Liberation" (co-edited by Anthony J. Nocella II, John Sorenson, Kim Socha, and Atsuko Matsuoka). The publication defines the basic aims and principles of the movement. ICAS also issues three journals - ''Journal for Critical Animal Studies'', ''Peace Studies Journal'', and ''Green Theory and Praxis Journal''.

== Ten principles ==
The principles guiding CAS's work were included in the article "Introducing Critical Animal Studies" which was published in the ''Journal of the Critical Animal Studies'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Introducing Critical Animal Studies |first1=Steve |last1=Best |first2=Anthony J. |last2=Nocella |first3=Richard |last3=Kahn |first4=Carol |last4=Gigliotti |first5=Lisa |last5=Kemmerer |journal=Journal for Critical Animal Studies |volume=5 |issue=1 |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Interdisciplinarity: it supports collaborative work of scholars from different fields to provide a deeper, comprehensive insight into human-animal relations.
# Subjectivity: it questions the notion that academic analysis can be entirely objective, devoid of normative values and political commitments.
# Theory-to-practice approach: it perceives theory as a starting point for political action and social commitment. 
# [[Intersectionality]]: it draws attention to common roots of many forms of oppression, such as [[speciesism]], [[sexism]], [[racism]] and other violence-based ideologies, considered as components of global systems of domination.
# Antihierarchical approach: it provides anti-[[Capitalism|capitalist]] stance, aimed at [[Democracy|democratization]] and decentralization of the society.
# Solidarity: it does not concentrate solely on animal issues. Instead, it aims at making alliances with other social movements devoted to struggle against oppression. 
# Total liberation: it emphasizes the need for human, non-human and [[Earth Liberation Front|Earth liberation]] and perceives them as a common struggle.
# Deconstructing binaries: it undermines socially constructed oppositions, such as human-animal and nature-culture.
# Radical politics: it supports all tactics promoting change used in social justice movements, such as economic sabotage and [[direct action]].
# Critical dialogue: it promotes constructive dialogue between diverse academic groups, activists and individuals, public and non-profit sectors.

== Animal studies ==
The term "critical animal studies" is often used as a synonym for [[animal studies]] and [[Anthrozoology|human-animal studies]]. However, there are significant differences between these movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 'Locating the 'critical' in critical animal studies' [in:] 'The rise of Critical Animal Studies. From the Margins to the Centre'|last = Nik Taylor, Richard Twine|first = |publisher = |year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; CAS can be seen as a more radical option, overtly underlining the necessity of political engagement and advocating [[direct action]], which may be considered controversial in traditional academic circles. Supporters of CAS often emphasize that although animal studies has made a large contribution to growing awareness about the complexities of human-animal relations, it lacks a deep moral engagement and remains detached from the most significant problems. It is worth considering, however, that the term 'animal studies' refers to diverse scholars and methodologies, some of which clearly state the necessity of ethical commitment.

'''''Dudgeon v the United Kingdom''''' (1981) was a [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) case, which held that [[Labouchere Amendment|Section 11]] of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] which criminalised male homosexual acts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland violated the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The case was significant
#as the first successful case before the ECtHR on the criminalisation of male homosexuality
#as the case which led to legislation in 1982 bringing the law on male homosexuality in Northern Ireland into line with that in Scotland (since 1980) and in England and Wales (since 1967);
#as a lead-in to ''[[Norris v. Ireland]]'', a later case before the ECtHR argued by [[Mary Robinson]], which challenged the continued application of the same 1885 law in the [[Republic of Ireland]]; and,
#for setting the legal precedent that ultimately resulted in the [[Council of Europe]] requiring that no member state could criminalise male or female homosexual behaviour.

==Facts==
[[Jeff Dudgeon]] was a shipping clerk and gay activist in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], when he was interrogated by the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] about his sexual activities. He filed a complaint with the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] in 1975, which after a hearing in 1979 declared his complaint admissible to the European Court of Human Rights. The Court hearing was in April 1981 before a full panel of 19 judges. Dudgeon was represented by barristers [[Anthony Gifford, 6th Baron Gifford|Lord Gifford]], Terry Munyard and solicitor Paul Crane.

On 22 October 1981, the Court agreed with the Commission that Northern Ireland's criminalisation of homosexual acts between consenting adults was a violation of [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] which says: "Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society ... for the protection of health or morals".&lt;!-- full stop outside - sentence continues in source --&gt; Judgment was given in Dudgeon's favour on that aspect by 15 votes to 4.

It stated the "restriction imposed on Mr. Dudgeon under Northern Ireland law, by reason of its breadth and absolute character, is, quite apart from the severity of the possible penalties provided for, disproportionate to the aims sought to be achieved." However, the ruling continued, "it was for countries to fix for themselves&amp;nbsp;... any appropriate extension of the [[age of consent]] in relation to such conduct."

==Judgment==
The Court held by 14 votes to 5 that it was not necessary also to examine the case under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 which would otherwise have meant considering the aspect of discrimination. It stated that "once it has been held that the restriction on the applicant's right to respect for his private sexual life give rise to a breach of Article 8 by reason of its breadth and absolute character, there is no useful legal purpose to be served in determining whether he has in addition suffered discrimination as compared with other persons." Minority opinions were written on both aspects.

==Significance==
This was the first case at the European Court of Human Rights to be decided in favour of LGBT rights. It was only the thirty-fifth case judged by the Court, and the fifth violation found against the UK. There have been upwards of ten thousand more cases judged at Strasbourg.

As a consequence of the judgment, male homosexual sex was [[decriminalised]] in Northern Ireland in October 1982. Female homosexual behaviour was never criminal anywhere in the United Kingdom.

The MPs from Northern Ireland who voted on the proposed decriminalising Order were universally opposed.

In the Article 50 settlement of 24 February 1983, no damages were awarded, the verdict being seen as sufficient reward for the hurt and pain suffered. Costs of £3,315 were awarded towards Dudgeon's legal fees but he was denied the remaining £1,290 because of a view by the Court that his then lawyers were operating on a contingency basis. Three of the five judges who voted against him on the main case and the British judge constituted a majority of the seven judges on the settlement court panel.

A Freedom of Information Request later revealed a note from a Conservative minister from that time, saying, "Put this to one side; Strasbourg will do the needful." This implied that although sympathetic to Dudgeon's case, the UK government preferred using the European Court of Human Rights to change the law in Northern Ireland rather than intervene itself.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, Fiona (21 February 2015). [https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/jeffrey-dudgeon-a-reformer-not-a-revolutionary-1.2111345 "Jeffrey Dudgeon: 'A reformer, not a revolutionary{{'"}}]. ''[[The Irish Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The same provision of the 1885 Act was still in force in the [[Republic of Ireland]], and upheld by the [[Supreme Court of Ireland]] in 1983. ''[[Norris v. Ireland]]'' (1988), successfully challenged this in the ECtHR, with ''Dudgeon'' serving as the key precedent. This led to decriminalisation in the Republic of Ireland in 1993. It was similarly followed in ''[[Modinos v. Cyprus]]'' (1993), finding an equivalent law to be a violation.

''Dudgeon v. United Kingdom'' was cited by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] decision which found anti-sodomy laws in 14 remaining states to be unconstitutional.

The Electoral Commission is an independent body set up by the UK Parliament. It regulates party and election finance and sets standards for well-run elections.


== History ==

The Electoral Commission was created following a recommendation by the fifth report of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]]. 

The Commission's mandate was set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA), and ranges from the regulation of political donations and expenditure by political and third parties through to promoting greater participation in the electoral process. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 required local authorities to review all polling stations, and to provide a report on the reviews to the Electoral Commission.


The [[Political Parties and Elections Act 2009]] granted the Electoral Commission a variety of new supervisory and investigatory powers. It fills significant gaps in the commission's current powers, the Act also provides a new range of flexible civil sanctions, both financial and non-financial are currently proposed to extend to regulated donees as well as political parties.

The Act also permitted the introduction of individual electoral registration in Great Britain and made changes to the structure of the Electoral Commission, including allowing for the appointment of four new electoral commissioners who will be nominated by political parties.

The Electoral Commission faced widespread criticism for the handling of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 UK general election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7120743.ece |title=Turned-away voters told to demand rerun |date=9 May 2010 |publisher=Times Online |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530154429/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7120743.ece |archivedate=30 May 2010|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/watchdog-launches-inquiry-into-chaos-at--polling-stations-1968202.html |title=Watchdog launches inquiry into chaos at polling stations |date=8 May 2010 |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=30 May 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/election/article-1271522/General-Election-2010-Postal-voting-farce-shames-democracy.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |title=Postal passport to ballot frauds: A farce that shames our democracy |date=4 May 2010 |publisher=Mail Online|accessdate=30 May 2013 |location=London |first=Leo |last=McKinstry}}&lt;/ref&gt; including allegations of fraudulent postal voting,&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt; polling stations being unprepared for an evening surge of voters,&lt;ref name="bbcnews"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8666537.stm |title=Election 2010: Voters' frustrations at polling problems |date=7 May 2010 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; policing of voters protesting at one polling station,&lt;ref name="bbcnews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/08/henry-porter-proportional-representation |title=Is this really the end of Punch and Judy politics? |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=30 May 2013 |location=London |first=Henry |last=Porter |date=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only enough ballot papers for 80% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/2010/05/06/astronomical-turnout-blamed-for-ballot-papers-running-out-in-liverpool-100252-26393928 |title='Astronomical turnout' blamed for ballot papers running out in Liverpool |date=6 May 2010 |publisher=Liverpool Echo |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities and objectives ==

=== Integrity and transparency of party election finance ===

As the regulator of political party funding in the UK, the Commission's role is to ensure the integrity and transparency of party and election finance.

The Commission provides guidance for political parties and regulated donees to assist them in meeting their legal obligations to follow party funding rules. 

Political parties must submit annual statements of accounts, detailing income and expenditure, to the Electoral Commission. The Commission publishes these on its website.

Political parties and regulated donees are required to submit reports of all donations they receive to the Commission. The Commission maintains a publicly available and searchable register of these donations on its website.

At general elections to the UK Parliament, EU Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly political parties are required to submit campaign spending returns to the Electoral Commission.

The Commission may impose financial civil penalties on political parties and their accounting units if they fail to submit donation and loans returns, campaign spending return or statements of account.

The Commission also has the power to seek forfeiture of impermissible donations accepted by political parties.

=== Registering political parties ===
The Commission registers political parties and regulates party compliance.

The Commission maintains the registers of political parties in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/107680/intro-registration-rp.pdf|title=Introduction to registering a political party |date=1 January 2017 |publisher=Electoral Commission |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complete and accurate electoral registers and a well run electoral registration process ===

The commission produces guidance and gives advice on [[elections in the United Kingdom#electoral registration|electoral registration]] to [[electoral registration officer]]s in [[Great Britain]]. 

The commission has published performance standards for electoral registration in Great Britain. Electoral registration officers are required to report against these standards and the commission will make this information publicly available.

As part of this work, the commission runs a series of public awareness campaigns ahead of elections and throughout the year to encourage people to register to vote.  

These focus on audiences that research indicates are less likely to be on the electoral register, including recent home-movers, students and UK citizens living overseas.

=== Well-run elections and referendums which produce results that are acceptable ===

The commission produces guidance and gives advice on electoral administration to [[Returning officer#United Kingdom|returning officers]] and electoral administrators in [[Great Britain]]. 

The Commission has set performance standards for returning officers and referendum counting officers in Great Britain. These standards do not apply to local government elections in Scotland as they are a devolved matter.

The Commission has a statutory duty to produce reports on the administration of certain elections (for example [[Elections in the United Kingdom#General elections|UK Parliamentary general elections]]) and may be asked to report on other types of election (such as [[Elections in the United Kingdom#National parliament and assembly elections|local government elections]]).

== Other responsibilities ==

=== EU seat distribution ===

The commission is responsible for recommending which regions are allocated how many of the [[European Parliament constituency|73 seats]] that the United Kingdom holds at the [[European Parliament]].

=== Referendum responsibilities ===

The Electoral Commission has a number of responsibilities in relation to [[referendums in the United Kingdom|referendums]]. These include:
*commenting on the wording of the referendum question (the government is responsible for proposing the wording)
*registration of campaigners
*designating lead campaign organisations and the making of grants
*monitoring referendum expenditure limits and donations
*certifying and announcing the result.
*As with other electoral events, the Electoral Commission has a statutory duty to prepare and publish a report on the administration of a relevant referendum and to give guidance and advice to administrators and campaigners.
*The chair of the commission, or someone appointed by the chair, will also be appointed as Chief Counting Officer.

As of 2017 the Electoral Commission has to date overseen the holding of two UK-wide referendums, the first was the [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|2011 AV Referendum]] and the second and most notable was the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 EU Referendum]], on both  occasions the then chair of the Electoral Commission [[Jenny Watson]] acted as the appointed Chief Counting Officer. The commission also oversaw the [[North East England devolution referendum, 2004|2004 North East England Devolution Referendum]], the [[Welsh devolution referendum, 2011|2011 Welsh Devolution Referendum]] and also the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|2014 Scottish Independence Referendum]]. The commission has no legal position in the legislation concerning referendums proposed by the devolved Scottish and Welsh administrations.

== Organisation ==

=== Commissioners and Chief Executive ===
*Sir John Holmes was appointed by the Speakers Committee in January 2017 as the third chair of the Electoral Commission. Sir John was previously a senior civil servant and diplomat. 
*Rob Vincent 
*Professor Elan Closs Stephens
*Anna Carragher
D*ame Sue Bruce 
Claire Bassett is the current Chief Executive of the Electoral Commission. From 1 October 2010, four additional Commissioners serve on a part-time basis who are nominated by the leaders of political parties, scrutinised by the Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission and approved by the House of Commons by means of an Address to the Queen requesting their appointment. Those nominated by the three largest parties serve terms of four years, while the Commissioner nominated by a smaller party serves for a two-year term. The appointments of nominated Commissioners are renewable once.[9] These current Commissioners are:[10] • John Horam (Conservative) • David Howarth (Liberal Democrat) • Bridget Prentice (Labour) • Alasdair Morgan (Scottish National Party)

=== National commissions ===
To reflect the views of stakeholders and the distinctive procedures and practices in the [[countries of the United Kingdom]] there are separate electoral commissions for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

=== English regional offices  ===
Since February 2007 the commission has also had regional offices across England in the South West, Eastern and South East, London, Midlands, and North of England regions.

=== Speaker’s Committee on the Electoral Commission ===
The Electoral Commission is answerable to Parliament via the Speaker's Committee (established by PPERA 2000). The Commission must submit an annual estimate of income and expenditure to the Committee. The Committee, made up of Members of Parliament, is responsible for answering Parliamentary Questions on behalf of the Commission. The Member who takes questions for the Speaker's Committee is Bridget Phillipson.

=== Parliamentary Parties Panels (PPP) ===
The PPP is composed of representatives from all UK parliamentary political parties with two or more sitting MPs. The PPP was established by PPERA and meets quarterly to submit views to the Commission on matters affecting political parties.

There are equivalent non-statutory bodies for the devolved legislatures in Scotland (Scottish Parliament Political Parties Panel), Wales (Wales Political Parties Panel) and Northern Ireland (Northern Ireland Assembly Parties Panel).

== Publications ==

The commission conducts a wide variety of research into electoral administration, electoral registration and the integrity and transparency of party finance, and a variety of guidance materials for political parties, regulated donees and electoral administrators.

In [[property law]], a '''failure of issue''' is a situation in which a property-holder dies without leaving children who could have inherited their property.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers}}, § 26.8 (defining phrase).&lt;/ref&gt; Before the nineteenth century, [[common law]] courts recognized a system of property laws where title would revert to the original grantor upon the failure of issue, but modern laws now permit property to pass to third parties when grantees no longer have living heirs to inherit the property.&lt;ref name = Rest266&amp;267&gt;{{smallcaps|Restatement (First) of Property: Death Without Issue}}, § 266; {{smallcaps|Restatement (First) of Property: Conveyance "to B and His Heirs, But If B Dies Without Issue Then to C"}}, § 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical understanding==
Between the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries, the ruling class in [[England]] was concerned with preserving the status of the [[landed gentry]].&lt;ref name = cmnt.a&gt;{{smallcaps|Restatement (First) of Property: Death Without Issue}}, § 266, comment a.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, a system of property laws developed where estates would revert to the grantor once the tenant no longer had any living descendants (also known as a [[fee tail]]).&lt;ref name = cmnt.a/&gt; Courts have traditionally described the reversion of property interests upon the extinction of descendants as the ''indefinite failure of issue''.&lt;ref name = cmnt.a/&gt; By the seventeenth entry, English courts had extended this system beyond real property and also applied it to other personal property.&lt;ref name = cmnt.a/&gt; However, by the early nineteenth century, [[United States law|American]] courts began to favor a system of ''definite failure of issue'', where grantors could convey a property interest to a third party if a grantee no longer had any living heirs.&lt;ref name = cmnt.a/&gt; This system was codified in England in the [[Wills Act 1837]].&lt;ref&gt;7 Will 4 &amp; 1 Vict c 26, § 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern application==
Today, most jurisdictions recognize a system of ''definite failure of issue'' where property can be conveyed to a third party upon the death of a grantees heirs.&lt;ref name = Rest266&amp;267/&gt; Additionally, most jurisdictions have abolished fee tails.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, J.B. Ruhl, [http://www.vanderbiltlawreview.org/content/articles/2015/04/The-Tale-of-the-Fee-Tail-in-Downton-Abbey.pdf ''The Tale of the Fee Tail in Downton Abbey''], 68 {{smallcaps|Vand. L. Rev. En Banc}} 131, 131 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In jurisdictions that do recognize fee tails, most courts will recognize a "fee upon indefinite failure of issue" where the property returns to the original grantor if the tenant dies without issue.&lt;ref&gt;3-23 {{smallcaps|Thompson on Real Property}}, Thomas Editions § 23.13 (noting that this arrangement "is preferred under the majority rule").&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Family Computer Network System'''|ファミリーコンピュータ ネットワークシステム|Famirī Konpyūta Nettowāku Shisutemu|lead=yes}}, also known as the '''Famicom Net System''' or '''Famicom Modem''', is a video game peripheral for Nintendo's [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]], released in September 1988 only in Japan. It uses a card based format, reminiscent to the [[HuCard]] for [[Hudson Soft]]'s and [[NEC]]'s [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] or the [[Sega Card]] for the [[Master System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/oroti/famicom/ish11.html |title=ファミコンの周辺機器が大集合! ザ☆周辺機器ズ 11 |publisher=Ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2006/03/25/103,1143298259,50588,0,0.html Wi-Fiコネクションについて講演　『ウイイレ』など40タイトルが開発中]''. [[Famitsu]]. 25 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It allowed the user access to a server that provided live stock trades, [[cheating in video games|game cheats]], jokes, weather forecasts, horse betting, and a small amount of downloadable content.&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"&gt;{{ cite magazine | first=Masaharu | last=Takano | title=How the Famicom Modem was Born | others=[http://www.glitterberri.com/developer-interviews/how-the-famicom-was-born/developing-the-famicom-modem/ English translation by GlitterBerri] | date=September 11, 1995 | magazine=Nikkei Electronics | language=Japanese }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience Nintendo gained with this endeavor led directly to the deployment of the satellite based [[Satellaview]] network for the [[Super Famicom]] in the early 1990s.  Nintendo would eventually engage in Internet based networking, via the [[64DD]] and its accompanying Randnet service, the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], the [[Nintendo GameCube–Game Boy Advance cable|Game Boy Advance Cable]], the Nintendo DS's DS Download Play, the Wii's [[WiiConnect24]] and its shop, the [[Nintendo DSi]]'s DSi Shop, and the [[Nintendo Network]] for the [[Nintendo 3DS]], [[Wii U]], and [[Nintendo Switch | Switch]].

==History==
===Development===
Beginning in mid-1987, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi requested the exploration of a partnership with the [[Nomura Securities]] financial company, to create an information network service in Japan based on the Famicom.  Led by Masayuki Uemura, [[Nintendo Research &amp; Development 2]] developed the modem hardware; and Nomura Securities developed the client and server software and the information database. Uemura cautioned that they "weren't confident that they would be able to make network games entertaining".  Five unreleased prototypes of network-enabled games were developed for the system, including Yamauchi's favorite classic, [[Go (game)|Go]].&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"/&gt;

===Production===

[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Modem-Controller.jpg|thumb|right|The controller included with the modem.]]
The Famicom Modem began mass production in September 1988. The accompanying proprietary online service was soon launched the same year alongside [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]]'s new DDX-TP telephone gateway for its existing packet switched network.  NTT's launch initially suffered reliability problems that were painstakingly assessed by Nintendo at individual users' homes and traced back to the network.&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"/&gt;

Nintendo's sole final application of the Famicom Modem was the 1991 system called Super Mario Club.  It was formed for toy shops, where the Famicom was deployed as a networked arcade kiosk, serving consumers with a member-store-created searchable online database of Famicom game reviews. Nintendo performed market research by analyzing users' search behaviors, and directly received user feedback messages.&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"/&gt;

In June 1989, Nintendo of America's vice president of marketing Peter Main, said that the Famicom was present in 37% of Japan's households and that its interactive game and stock network based upon the Famicom Modem had been running for some time.&lt;ref name="How Nintendo Can Help A.T.&amp;T"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=International New York Times | issn=0362-4331 | title=Talking Deals; How Nintendo Can Help A.T.&amp;T. | first=Michael | last=Freitag | date=June 8, 1989 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/08/business/talking-deals-how-nintendo-can-help-at-t.html | accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Modem-Network-System-Horse-Betting.jpg|thumb|right|The software card for the horse betting program.]]
Nintendo shipped a lifetime total of 130,000 Famicom Modems. Even after the resolution of stability problems with the NTT's network launch, the Famicom Modem market presence was considered "weak" for its whole lifetime for various reasons: product usability; competition from personal computers and other appliances; and the difficult nature of early adoption by the technologically unsavvy financial customer. Uemura stated that the system's most popular application was ultimately home-based horse race betting, with a peak of 100,000 units used and capturing 35% of the online horse betting market even amongst diverse competition from PCs and from dedicated horse betting network terminal appliances.&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"/&gt;

===Legacy===
Wanting to replicate and expand upon the progress seen with the Famicom Modem in Japan, Nintendo of America began a series of open announcements in mid-1989 to describe its private talks with AT&amp;T over the prospect of launching an information network service in America in 1990.&lt;ref name="How Nintendo Can Help A.T.&amp;T"/&gt;  The plans never materialized.

A modem for NES was tested in the United States by the [[Minnesota State Lottery]]. It would have allowed players to buy [[scratchcard]]s and play the lottery with their NES at home. It was not released in the United States because some parents and legislators voiced concern that minors might learn to play the lottery illegally and anonymously, regardless of assurances from Nintendo to the contrary.&lt;ref name="lottery"&gt;{{cite news |title= Nintendo and Minnesota Set A Living-Room Lottery Test|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/27/business/nintendo-and-minnesota-set-a-living-room-lottery-test.html|accessdate=2008-02-16|date =1991-09-27|work=New York Times | first=Eben | last=Shapiro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet-based gambling was banned in Minnesota.&lt;ref name="Minnesota Gambling and Criminal Defense"&gt;{{cite web | title=Minnesota Gambling and Criminal Defense | url=http://www.nvo.com/beaulier/minnesotagamblingcrimes/ | accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online content would later be delivered to Nintendo's customers via the [[Super Famicom]]'s [[Satellaview]] peripheral. Masayuki Uemura, lead designer of the Famicom Modem at [[Nintendo Research &amp; Development 2]], said: "Our experiences with the Famicom Modem triggered Nintendo’s entrance into the satellite data broadcasting market in April, 1995".&lt;ref name="How the Famicom Modem was Born"/&gt;

'''''Flood v. Kuhn''''', 407 U.S. 258 (1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Flood v. Kuhn|volume=407|page=258|year=1972}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision upholding, by a 5–3 margin, the [[antitrust]] exemption first granted to [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) in ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]''. It arose from a challenge by [[St. Louis Cardinals]]' [[outfield]]er [[Curt Flood]] when he refused to be [[Trade (sports)|traded]] to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] after the [[1969 Major League Baseball season|1969 season]]. He sought injunctive relief from the [[reserve clause]], which prevented him from negotiating with another team for a year after his contract expired. Named as initial respondents were [[Commissioner of baseball|baseball commissioner]] [[Bowie Kuhn]], MLB and all of its then-24 member clubs.

Although the Court ruled in baseball's favor 5–3, it admitted the original grounds for the antitrust exemption were tenuous at best, that baseball was indeed [[interstate commerce]] for purposes of the act and the exemption was an "anomaly"&lt;ref name="407US281"&gt;''Flood'', 407 U.S. at 281.&lt;/ref&gt; it had explicitly refused to extend to other professional sports or entertainment. That admission set in motion events which ultimately led to [[Seitz decision|an arbitrator's ruling]] nullifying the reserve clause and opening the door for [[Free agent|free agency]] in baseball and other sports.

The opinion has been criticized in several ways. It is seen by some as an overly strict and reflexive reliance on the [[legal doctrine]] of ''[[stare decisis]]''&lt;ref name="Eskridge"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eskridge |first=William, Jr. |year=1988 |month= |title=Overruling Statutory Precedent |journal=Georgetown Law Journal |volume=76 |issue= |pages=1361 |issn=0016-8092 |url=}}; cited at Stephen F.

==Background of the case==

===Reserve clause===
{{main|Reserve clause}}
The reserve clause had been part of baseball contracts since the game's early days. The [[National League]] had begun using it in the late 19th century; the [[American League]] began using it in 1903 as part of the truce between the two that created MLB.&lt;ref name="Abrams1"&gt;Abrams, Roger I.; ''Legal Bases: Baseball and the Law''; 1998, [[Temple University Press]], {{ISBN|1-56639-890-8}}, 45, 64–69. Cited at {{cite journal |last=Tismpris |first=William |date=Summer 2004 |title=A Question of (Anti)trust: Flood v. Kuhn and the Viability of Major League Baseball's Antitrust Exemption |journal=Richmond Journal of Law and the Public Interest |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=69–86 | url=http://rjolpi.richmond.edu/archive/Volume_VIII_Issue_1.pdf |accessdate= 2008-02-27 }} 69, note 9&lt;/ref&gt; Team owners realized that if players could go from team to team seeking higher pay, salaries of all players, not just stars, would go up. They feared some teams might have to fold under such competitive pressure, and included the reserve clause, so called since a team reserved rights to a player for a year after the contract expired, to limit free agency.

Such [[collusion]] in other industries had been ruled to be [[restraint of trade]] in violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. Players had two options to resist it and become free agents. They could ask to be released from their contracts (which they rarely were), or hold out and refuse to report until the year was up, forfeiting their pay in the process. While star players were able to exercise some leverage this way, most who held out were often traded to other teams and wound up making less money.

A suit was brought in the 1920s, ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]'' ({{ussc|259|200|1922}}), by the owner of the defunct [[Baltimore Terrapins]] [[Federal League]] team who accused the major leagues of conspiring to crush MLB's one remaining competitor. Instead, Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] ruled that baseball, the only professional team sport in the country at the time enjoying wide interest, was exempt since it was not interstate commerce and teams' travel to games in other states was merely "incidental" to MLB's main business, the staging of baseball games. Although the reserve clause was not part of the case, the exemption meant that the Supreme Court or Congress would have had to say otherwise before it could be legally voided.&lt;ref name="Federal Baseball Club"&gt;''Federal Baseball Club v. National League'', {{ussc|259|200|1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two possible challenges in the early 1950s failed. Former [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] outfielder [[Danny Gardella]] sued after baseball teams blacklisted him following his brief stint in the [[Mexican League]]. [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|An appeals court]] overturned an initial verdict for baseball, and commissioner [[Happy Chandler]] decided to settle rather than risk the overturning of ''Federal Baseball Club''.&lt;ref name="Gardella"&gt;Tsimpris, ''op. cit.'', 6&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, George Earl Toolson, a pitcher in the [[New York Yankees]]' [[farm team|farm system]], refused to report to a new minor league team when sent down. The ensuing decision, ''[[Toolson v. New York Yankees]]'' ({{ussc|346|356|1953}}), let the exemption stand citing lack of congressional interest in repealing it.&lt;ref name="Toolson"&gt;''Toolson v. United States'', 346 U.S. 356–357.&lt;/ref&gt; Justices [[Harold Hitz Burton]] and [[Stanley Forman Reed]] dissented, saying baseball as it was then played met the definition of interstate commerce.&lt;ref name="Toolson dissents"&gt;''Toolson v. United States, 346 U.S.'' 357–365, Burton, J.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, when the Court declined to extend the antitrust exemption to professional football in ''[[Radovich v. National Football League]]'' ({{ussc|352|445|1957}}), it raised some hopes that another challenge to might succeed when it admitted "were we considering the question of baseball for the first time upon a clean slate we would have no doubts" that it was interstate commerce.&lt;ref name="Radovich cite"&gt;''Radovich v. National Football League'', 352 U.S. 445, 452, Clark, J.&lt;/ref&gt; 1971's ''[[Haywood v. National Basketball Association]]'' ({{ussc|401|1204|1971}}), an emergency appeal issued by Justice [[William O. Douglas]], similarly denied that exemption to professional basketball and noted "the decision in this suit would be similar to the one on baseball's reserve clause which our decisions exempting baseball from the antitrust laws have foreclosed".&lt;ref name="Haywood"&gt;''Haywood v. National Basketball Association'', 401 U.S. 1204, 1205, Douglas, J.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[Rick Barry]] of the NBA's [[San Francisco Warriors]] became the first major-league professional athlete to challenge the reserve clause in court. He wanted to play for the [[Oakland Oaks (ABA)|Oakland Oaks]] of the rival [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA), since his father-in-law was the team's coach. His challenge was unsuccessful, but after sitting out a year he signed with the Oaks anyway, the first NBA star to change leagues during the rivalry between them.&lt;ref name="Slate Rick Barry article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hollander|first=Dave|title=Big Jerk, Bigger Hero|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2013/11/rick_barry_free_agency_one_of_the_biggest_jerks_in_basketball_history_is.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=November 24, 2013|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curt Flood===
{{main|Curt Flood}}
[[File:Curt Flood letter to Bowie Kuhn.jpg|thumb|190px|Flood's letter to [[Bowie Kuhn]] in December 1969.]]
In [[1956 in baseball|1956]], at the age of 18, Flood had, without an [[sports agent|agent]] or attorney to represent or advise him, signed his first professional baseball contract with the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. Two years later he was traded to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and became one of the team's stars. He [[batting average|batted .300]] in six of the next 12 seasons, earned seven [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove awards]] (including one for an [[error (baseball)|error]]-free [[1966 Major League Baseball season|1966 season]]), and played in three [[World Series]], two of which the Cardinals won.&lt;ref name="407US264"&gt;''Flood'', at 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last of those World Series was [[1968 World Series|the 1968 contest]], in which the Cardinals fell to the [[Detroit Tigers]] in seven games. The deciding play of that last game had been an error by Flood in the seventh inning that allowed the Tigers to score the first two of their four runs. After the season team president [[Gussie Busch]], CEO of club owner [[Anheuser-Busch]], with whom the player had long enjoyed a close personal friendship, offered Flood a raise of $5,000, less than a third of what Flood thought he deserved after a stellar regular season at the plate and in the field.&lt;ref name="Bitter Brew"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knoedelseder|first1=William|authorlink1=William Knoedelseder|title=Bitter Brew: The Rise and Fall of Anheuser–Busch and America's Kings of Beer|date=2012|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780062009272|pages=109–113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aeu3UYUtLokC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Flood eventually got the higher salary he wanted, he believed Busch had intended to punish him for his costly error. He was further persuaded of this when the owner publicly chewed out the team during spring training before the next season, after players had [[1969 Major League Baseball season#Spring training boycott|successfully boycotted spring training]] for a week to get the owners to contribute more to their pension fund. Without mentioning any player by name, Busch excoriated players for forgetting that fans were the most important thing in the game.&lt;ref name="Bitter Brew" /&gt;

During [[1969 St. Louis Cardinals season|the subsequent season]], the team struggled and ultimately wound up finishing fourth in the newly created National League East division, missing a chance to redeem their postseason failure of a year earlier. The Cardinals began reorganizing the team management late in the season. Flood further aggravated his relationship with the front office by criticizing this since the team had not yet been eliminated from the playoffs at the time.

In October 1969, after the season had ended, Flood, then one of the Cardinals' [[team captain|captains]], learned from a low-level Cardinals official&lt;ref name="Bitter Brew" /&gt; that he had been traded to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] along with, and for, several other players. He had not been consulted about this beforehand, and did not want to play for the poorly performing Phillies in Philadelphia before fans the [[African-American]] Flood believed were [[prejudice|racist]].

Like many players, he had long chafed at the reserve clause,&lt;ref name="Flood's hatred of reserve clause"&gt;[[John Helyar|Helyar, John]], ''[[Lords of the Realm: The Real History of Baseball]]'', Ballantine Books, New York 1995; {{ISBN|0-345-39261-2}}; 107; cited at Tsimpris, 70n11.&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote to Kuhn shortly before Christmas asking to be declared a free agent: "I do not feel I am a piece of property to be bought and sold irrespective of my wishes", he said. "I believe I have the right to consider offers from other clubs before making any decision." Kuhn denied the request, reminding Flood he was contractually obligated to play for the Phillies.

In January 1970, Flood brought suit in New York, where MLB was headquartered, seeking $1 million in damages and injunctive relief from the reserve clause, which his legal arguments controversially compared to [[slavery in the United States|slavery]]. He sat out [[1970 Major League Baseball season|that year's baseball season]], foregoing $100,000 in salary, and signed with the [[Washington Senators (1961–1971)|Washington Senators]] for more money in 1971, only to leave the team early in the season when he was not playing well. He never played again.&lt;ref name="407US365-66"&gt;''Flood'', 407 U.S. at 265–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and appeal==
The [[Major League Baseball Players Association]]'s team representatives voted unanimously to support Flood.&lt;ref name="Imperfect Diamond"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lupien, Tony |author2=Lowenfish, Lee |title=The imperfect diamond: the story of baseball's reserve system and the men who fought to change it |publisher=Stein and Day |location=New York |year=1980 |pages=207–221 |isbn=0-8128-2709-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His motion for a preliminary injunction was denied, with Judge [[Irving Ben Cooper]] of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York]] citing the sport's cultural importance in American life: "The game is on higher ground; it behooves every one to keep it there."&lt;ref name="Cooper prelim injunction denial"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Flood v.

No -duty players testified on his behalf, but his witnesses included [[Jackie Robinson]], [[Hank Greenberg]] and maverick owner [[Bill Veeck]]. Baseball's lawyers argued the clause was essential to maintain the sport.

Cooper ultimately ruled for Major League Baseball, stating that "the preponderance of credible proof does not favor elimination of the reserve clause." Even Flood's witnesses, he noted, had been ambivalent, regarding some version of it as beneficial to the sport.&lt;ref name="District court decision"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Flood v. Kuhn |vol=316 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=271 |pinpoint=275–276 |court=S.D.N.Y. |date=1970 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/316/271/1951551/ |accessdate=2018-02-19 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Flood appealed the case to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit]], which affirmed Cooper's decision on the basis of ''Federal Baseball''.&lt;ref name="appellate court decision"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Flood v. Kuhn |vol=443 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=264 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=1971 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/443/264/245613/ |accessdate=2018-02-19 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Leonard P. Moore]] added that he thought it unlikely the Supreme Court would overturn that decision.&lt;ref name="Moore comment"&gt;''Supra.'' at 268, 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before the Supreme Court==

The court granted ''[[certiorari]]'' later that year.&lt;ref name="cert granted"&gt;''Flood v. Kuhn'', {{ussc|404|880|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former justice [[Arthur Goldberg]] returned to argue Flood's case before some of his former colleagues. Kuhn, a onetime star litigator, considered arguing the case himself, but ultimately deferred to Paul Porter and Louis Hoynes.&lt;ref name="Kuhn book"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hardball: The Education of a Baseball Commissioner |last=Kuhn |first=Bowie |authorlink=Bowie Kuhn |year=1988 |publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]] |location=[[Lincoln, Nebraska]] |isbn=0-8032-7784-9 |pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[oral argument]]s on March 20, 1972, Goldberg reiterated Flood's arguments about the harm done to players by the reserve system. Baseball's lawyers responded to them, but primarily invoked the game's place in American culture and the greater good done it by the reserve system.

Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Lewis Powell]] [[Judicial disqualification|recused]] himself from the case because he owned [[stock]] in [[Anheuser-Busch]], which owned the Cardinals.

==Decision==

By a 5–3 margin, the Court upheld the ''Federal Baseball'' and ''Toolson'' precedents. One justice, [[William O. Douglas]], who had been part of the majority in the latter case, dissented this time and expressed his regret. Even [[Harry Blackmun]]'s majority opinion conceded that baseball was as much interstate commerce as the other professional sports to which the Court had refused to extend the antitrust exemption.

===Majority===

Blackmun began the opinion with Section I, "The Game", a [[prologue]] recounting the [[history of baseball in the United States|history of baseball]], concluding with a detailed [[litany]] of events and finally the names of 83 legendary players from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries, beginning with [[Ty Cobb]] and [[Babe Ruth]] and ending with [[Jimmie Foxx]] and [[Lefty Grove]]. "The list seems endless", Blackmun wrote. In its entirety Section I takes up four pages of the ''[[United States Reports]]''.&lt;ref name="Blackmun's history of baseball"&gt;''Flood v. Kuhn'', 407 U.S. 257, 257–264.&lt;/ref&gt; In the footnotes, he quoted poetry by [[Ernest Thayer]] on "[[Casey at the Bat]]" and allowed of his list: "These are names only from earlier years. By mentioning some, one risks unintended omission of others equally celebrated."&lt;ref name="Blakmun notes"&gt;''Supra.'', n3, 4 and 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

After two further sections recounting the facts of the case, the lower courts' decisions and the Court's previous jurisprudence, Blackmun considered the legal issues at hand. He noted that the ''Federal Baseball'' court had not been persuaded by other case law at the time ruling that traveling [[vaudeville]] companies were engaged in interstate commerce and that other companies use of the mail and rail shipments had so qualified. ''Federal Baseball'' had also been cited as [[precedent]] in later cases without complaint.&lt;ref name="Judicial history of Federal Baseball"&gt;''Supra''., 271–72,&lt;/ref&gt;

In later cases, brought in the 1950s involving other organized sports and similar activities, the Court had refused to exempt them and noted, as it did when asked to end baseball's exemption outright in ''Toolson'', Congress's relative inactivity on the issue. Since then, Blackmun said, there had been some bills, but all intended to extend the exemption to other sports and none to repeal it entirely.

"In view of all this", he began section V, "it seems appropriate now to say that: Professional baseball is a business and engaged in interstate commerce". Invoking ''Radovich'', he admitted that "the slate is not clean. Indeed it has not been clean for half a century." The antitrust exemption created in ''Federal Baseball'' and upheld in ''Toolson'' was "an aberration confined to baseball". Nevertheless, there seemed to be little desire to end or weaken it, and given the problems he thought a judicial turnabout would cause for baseball, he cited the legal doctrine of ''[[stare decisis]]'' in upholding the previous rulings, saying "Under these circumstances, there is merit in consistency even though some might claim that beneath that consistency is a layer of inconsistency."&lt;ref name="Blackmun opinion"&gt;''Supra.'', 282–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Byron White]] signed the opinion, but noted he did not concur in Part I.

"I concur in all but Part I", noted [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren Burger]], as well. He did, however, say in his short concurring opinion that he felt ''Toolson'' had been wrongly decided and agreed with some other points [[William O. Douglas]] made in his dissent.&lt;ref name="Burger concurrence"&gt;''Supra.'', 285–86, Burger, C. J.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissents===

====Justice Douglas====

Douglas called ''Federal Baseball'' a "derelict in the stream of law that we, its creator, should remove. Only a romantic view of a rather dismal business account over the last 50 years would keep that derelict in midstream." He had come to regret having joined the majority in ''Toolson''.&lt;ref name="Douglas dissent"&gt;''Supra.'', 286–88.&lt;/ref&gt; He invoked three of the names on Blackmun's list as he agreed with Flood that the reserve clause unlawfully benefited the owners at players' expense:
{{quote|Baseball is today big business that is packaged with beer, with broadcasting, and with other industries. The beneficiaries of the Federal Baseball Club decision are not the Babe Ruths, Ty Cobbs, and Lou Gehrigs. The owners, whose records many say reveal a proclivity for predatory practices, do not come to us with equities. The equities are with the victims of the reserve clause. I use the word "victims" in the Sherman Act sense, since a contract which forbids anyone to practice his calling is commonly called an unreasonable restraint of trade.&lt;ref name="Douglas dissent" /&gt;}}
If a case challenging the antitrust exemption were coming before the Court for the first time, he said, he had no doubt he and his brother justices would have ruled differently. "The unbroken silence of Congress should not prevent us from correcting our own mistakes", he concluded.&lt;ref name="Douglas dissent" /&gt; [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]] joined his opinion.

====Justice Marshall====

Brennan also joined [[Thurgood Marshall]]'s dissent, a longer review of the case in which he came to the same conclusions as Douglas, expressed in more measured language:
{{quote|Has Congress acquiesced in our decisions in ''Federal Baseball Club'' and ''Toolson''? I think not. Had the Court been consistent and treated all sports in the same way baseball was treated, Congress might have become concerned enough to take action. But, the Court was inconsistent, and baseball was isolated and distinguished from all other sports. In Toolson the Court refused to act because Congress had been silent. But the Court may have read too much into this legislative inaction.Americans love baseball as they love all sports. Perhaps we become so enamored of athletics that we assume that they are foremost in the minds of legislators as well as fans. We must not forget, however, that there are only some 600 major league baseball players. Whatever muscle they might have been able to muster by combining forces with other athletes has been greatly impaired by the manner in which this Court has isolated them. It is this Court that has made them impotent, and this Court should correct its error ... Baseball should be covered by the antitrust laws beginning with this case and henceforth, unless Congress decides otherwise.&lt;ref name="Marshall dissent"&gt;''Supra''., 292–93, Marshall, J.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reaction==

Major League Baseball and its owners praised the decision, as did many of their supporters in the media. The players and some of their supporters, such as sportswriter [[Red Smith (sportswriter)|Red Smith]], criticized it. In legal circles, Blackmun's homage to baseball was criticized and ridiculed.

==Legacy==

The decision is often remembered today as paving the way for [[Free agent|free agency]] in baseball. However, it did so, according to [[Bill James]], only by showing players they could not rely on the courts to strike down the antitrust exemption and the reserve clause along with it.&lt;ref name="James cite"&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract |last=James |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill James |year=2001 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |isbn= 0-394-53713-0 |pages=748 }}, cited at Tsimpris, 79n93.&lt;/ref&gt; But the effort by a player of Flood's stature did galvanize the players, and according to [[Marvin Miller]] it made the general public aware of the reserve clause.&lt;ref name="Miller interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Belth|first=Alex|title= BRONX BANTER INTERVIEW: MARVIN|url=http://bronxbanter.baseballtoaster.com/archives/2935.html|publisher=Baseball Toaster|date=2003-03-21|accessdate=2008-02-27|quote= ... [B]y and large, there was no publicity about it. I think what the Flood case did was to bring it front and center. It focused attention. I think it made a few people realize for the first time how bad that system was, how un-American if you will. To that extent Flood's case made a positive contribution.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Labor law]] proved a more fruitful opportunity for the invalidation of the reserve clause. The next year the [[National Labor Relations Board]] voted that baseball came under its jurisdiction, and that led to the [[Seitz decision]] three years later that [[Andy Messersmith]] and [[Dave McNally]] were free agents after they had played out a year without signing new contracts. That event is considered the true beginning of baseball free agency.

Neither Congress nor any court has completely overturned baseball's antitrust exemption. Some [[bill (proposed law)|bill]]s that would do so were named the Curt Flood Act in his honor and later, memory. In 1998, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed one into law making baseball's employment practices subject to antitrust law,&lt;ref name="Curt Flood Act statement"&gt;{{cite news|last=Clinton|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Clinton|title=Statement on signing the Curt Flood Act of 1998|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2889/is_44_34/ai_53449102|date=1998-10-27|accessdate=2008-03-01|quote=This legislation is the successful culmination of bipartisan efforts to treat employment matters with respect to Major League Baseball players under the antitrust laws in the same way such matters are treated for athletes in other professional sports. | work=Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents}}&lt;/ref&gt; a largely moot point since by then free agency was well established (minor league players, however, remain bound to their parent clubs&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt;). Flood himself was remembered as much for this case as for his playing career when he died in 1997. He has not been inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] despite his accomplished career and effect on the game.&lt;ref name="Flood HoF"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baranger|first=Walt|title=Curtis Charles Flood|url=http://what-the-hall.info/index.shtml?flood|date=2007-09-23|accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal analysis and criticism==

Legal commentators have criticized the decision as not just a mistake but a compounding of the earlier mistake made in ''Federal Baseball'' and continued in ''Toolson''. According to antitrust expert Kevin McDonald of [[Jones Day]], ''Flood v. Kuhn'' is a "principle of antitrust law that is (1) indefensible as a matter of fact or policy, and (2) an embarrassment to the Court."&lt;ref name="McDonald10"&gt;McDonald, ''op. cit.'' 10&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes' original decision has been misread by both later cases to imply a divination of congressional intent to exclude baseball and a prescription for congressional action to remedy that, he argues: "Just as ''Toolson'' blamed Holmes for a problem (an express statutory exemption) that he did not create, ''Flood'' blamed him for insisting on a solution (Congressional action) that he did not mention."&lt;ref name="McDonald9"&gt;''Ibid.'', 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yale Law School|Yale law professor]] William Eskridge, a harsh critic of the decision, has called it "the most frequently criticized example of excessively strict ''stare decisis''."&lt;ref name="Eskridge" /&gt; It is often counterpointed to the Court's decision in the 1940 trust case ''[[Helvering v. Hallock]]'',&lt;ref name="Tsimpris75"&gt;Tsimpris, ''op. cit.'', 75.&lt;/ref&gt; where Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] explicitly rejected the idea, embraced by Blackmun in ''Flood'', that the Court should consider congressional inaction as a tacit statement of acquiescence with one of its existing holdings, however questionable they may have seemed.&lt;ref name="Helvering"&gt;''Helvering v. Hallock'', 309 U.S. 106, 119–120 (1940), Frankfurter, J. "Nor does want of specific Congressional repudiations of the St. Louis Trust cases serve as an implied instruction by Congress to us not to reconsider, in the light of new experience, whether those decisions in conjunction with the Klein case, make for dissonance of doctrine. It would require very persuasive circumstances enveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from reexamining its own doctrines. To explain the cause of nonaction by Congress when Congress itself sheds no light is to venture into speculative unrealities."&lt;/ref&gt; Eskridge notes that there are many reasons besides express lack of intent that would forestall Congressional action to remedy a flawed Court decision.&lt;ref name="Eskridge2"&gt;Eskridge, ''supra.'', 1404, also {{cite journal |last=Eskridge |first=William N., Jr. |year=1988 |month= |title=Interpreting Legislative Inaction |journal=[[Michigan Law Review]] |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=67–137 [99–100] |doi=10.2307/1289147 |jstor= 1289147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackmun's list===

Even years after his death, Blackmun's paean to the game was still criticized as "rambling and syrupy"&lt;ref name="Nathanson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nathanson |first=Mitchell |date=Summer 2006 |title=Gatekeepers of Americana: Ownership's Never-ending Quest for Control of the Baseball Creed |journal=NINE: A Journal of Baseball History and Culture |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=68–87  |url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=mitchell_nathanson |accessdate= 2008-02-27 |quote= ... the Court, in an opinion authored by Justice Blackmun, engaged in a lengthy, rambling and syrupy retelling of the history of the game ... |doi=10.1353/nin.2006.0050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "juvenile".&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt; Roger Ian Abrams at [[Northeastern University School of Law]], who found that Blackmun had likely used Lawrence Ritter's 1966 book ''The Glory of Their Times'' as his primary source,&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;Abrams, Roger Ian; {{cite web|ssrn= 939545 |title=Blackmun's List }} Northeastern University School of Law Research Paper No. 08-2006, October 2006, 8. Retrieved February 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; showed how the careers of many of the players he listed had been impacted, often adversely, by the reserve system.&lt;ref name="Abrams9"&gt;''Ibid.'', 9 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackmun himself acknowledged in 1987, that his colleagues on the Court had, as Burger and Douglas's opinions suggest, seen it as "beneath the dignity of the Court". But he expressed no regrets,&lt;ref name="Blackmun obit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|authorlink=Linda Greenhouse|title= Justice Blackmun, Author of Abortion Right, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/05/us/justice-blackmun-author-of-abortion-right-dies.html|date=March 5, 1999 | accessdate=2008-02-27|quote=In a 1987 television interview, Justice Blackmun noted that some people, including some Supreme Court colleagues, had viewed the style of the opinion as 'beneath the dignity of the Court.' But he said, 'I would do it over again because I think baseball deserved it.' | work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; save the discovery by his [[law clerk|clerks]] that, after the decision had issued, he had forgotten [[Mel Ott]]. In his personal copy of the decision he penciled Ott's name in.&lt;ref name="Abrams6"&gt;Abrams, ''op. cit.'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Condemnation has not been universal. One commentator has defended it as a "trace of resistance to the hyperrationality of contemporary legal discourse".&lt;ref name="Campos"&gt;Campos, Paul; Silence and the Word; 64 U. Colo L. Rev. 1139, 1142 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; "If ''Flood'' is seen, however, as a decision grounded in a desire to adopt sound legal rules for sports leagues, Part I makes eminent sense", says [[University of Illinois College of Law|Illinois law professor]] Stephen F. Ross. He goes on to read the decision as doing exactly that, countering critics who charge it with being an overly strict application of ''stare decisis'' by showing how Blackmun and the other majority justices could reasonably, at that time, have been convinced that "contemporary antitrust doctrines would condemn many arrangements among owners that are arguably essential to baseball".&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;Ross, ''supra.'' 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inland Customs Line India.png|thumb|The route of the 1870s Inland Customs Line (red) and Great Hedge (green)]]
The '''Inland Customs Line''' which incorporated the '''Great Hedge of India''' (or '''Indian Salt Hedge'''&lt;ref name="pelham323"/&gt;) was a customs barrier built by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] across [[India]] primarily to collect the [[History of the British salt tax in India|salt tax]].  The customs line was begun while India was under the control of the [[East India Company]] but continued into the period of direct [[British Raj|British rule]].  The line had its beginnings in a series of [[customs house]]s that were established in [[Bengal]] in 1803 to prevent the smuggling of salt to avoid the tax.  These customs houses were eventually formed into a continuous barrier that was brought under the control of the [[Inland Customs Department]] in 1843.

The line was gradually expanded as more territory was brought under British control until it covered a distance of more than {{convert|2500|mi|km}}, often running alongside rivers and other natural barriers.  At its greatest extent it ran from the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] in the northwest until it reached the [[princely state]] of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], near the [[Bay of Bengal]], in the southeast.  The line was initially made of dead, thorny material such as the [[Flacourtia indica|Indian plum]] but eventually evolved into a living hedge that grew up to {{convert|12|ft|m}} high and was compared to the [[Great Wall of China]].  The Inland Customs Department employed customs officers, [[jemadar]]s and men to patrol the line and apprehend smugglers, reaching a peak of more than 14,000 staff in 1872.  The line and hedge were considered to be an infringement on the freedom of Indians and in opposition to [[free trade]] policies and were eventually abandoned in 1879 when the tax was applied at point of manufacture.  The salt tax itself would remain in place until 1946.

== Origins ==
When the Inland Customs Line was first conceived, [[British India]] was [[Company rule in India|governed by]] the [[East India Company]].  This situation lasted until 1858 when the responsibility for [[British Raj|government of the colony]] was transferred to [[the Crown]] following the events of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].  By 1780 [[Warren Hastings]], the Company's [[Governor-General of India]], had brought all salt manufacture in the [[Bengal Presidency]] under Company control.&lt;ref name="moxham44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed him to increase the ancient [[History of the British salt tax in India|salt tax]] in Bengal from 0.3 [[Indian rupee|rupees]] per [[maund]] (37&amp;nbsp;kg) to 3.25 rupees per maund by 1788, a rate that it remained at until 1879.&lt;ref name="moxham45"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This brought in a huge amount of [[revenue]] for the company, amounting to 6,257,470 rupees for the 1784–85 [[financial year]], at the cost of the Indian consumer, who would have to expend around two rupees per year (two months' income for a labourer{{contradiction inline |reason=This implies an average wage of Rs.1/mo, while "Staff" says it was Rs.3/mo?|date=November 2013}}) to provide salt for his family.&lt;ref name="moxham46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  There were taxes on salt in the other [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India territories]] but the tax in Bengal was the highest, with the other taxes at less than a third of the Bengal tax rate.

[[File:Joppen1907India1823a.jpg|thumb|India in 1823]]
It was possible to avoid paying the salt tax by extracting salt illegally in [[Salt evaporation pond|salt pans]], stealing it from warehouses or smuggling salt from the [[princely state]]s which remained outside of direct British rule.  The latter was the greatest threat to the company's salt revenues.&lt;ref name="moxham48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the smuggled salt came into Bengal from the west and the company decided to act to prevent this trade.  In 1803 a series of [[customs house]]s and barriers were constructed across major roads and rivers in Bengal to collect the tax on traded salt as well as duties on tobacco and other imports.&lt;ref name="moxham61"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  These customs houses were backed up by "preventative customs houses" located near salt works and the coast in Bengal to collect the tax at source.&lt;ref name="moxham62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These customs houses alone did little to prevent the mass avoidance of the salt tax.  This was due to the lack of a continuous barrier, corruption within the customs staff and the westward expansion of Bengal towards salt-rich states.&lt;ref name="moxham62"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham66"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham63"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1823 the Commissioner of Customs for [[Agra]], [[George Saunders (civil servant)|George Saunders]], installed a line of customs posts along the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers from [[Mirzapur]] to [[Allahabad]] that would eventually evolve into the Inland Customs Line.&lt;ref name="moxham66"/&gt;  The main aim was to prevent salt from being smuggled from the south and west but there was also a secondary line running from Allahabad to [[Nepal]] to prevent smuggling from the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Northwest frontier]].&lt;ref name="moxham67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The annexation of [[Sindh]] and the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] allowed the line to be extended north-west by [[G. H. Smith]], who had become Commissioner of Customs in 1834.&lt;ref name="moxham67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="siddiky8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Siddiky|2006|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith exempted items such as tobacco and iron from taxation to concentrate on salt and was responsible for expanding and improving the line, increasing its budget to 790,000 rupees per year and the staff to 6,600 men.&lt;ref name="moxham67"/&gt;  Under Smith's leadership the line saw many reforms and was officially named the Inland Customs Line in 1843.&lt;ref name="pelham323"/&gt;

== Inland Customs Line ==
Smith's new Inland Customs Line was first concentrated between [[Agra]] and [[Delhi]] and consisted of a series of customs posts at one mile intervals, linked by a raised path with gateways (known as "chokis") to allow people to cross the line every four miles.&lt;ref name="pelham323"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham68"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Policing of the barrier and surrounding land, to a distance of {{convert|10|to|15|mi|km}}, was the responsibility of the [[Inland Customs Department]], headed by a [[Commissioner of Inland Customs]].  The department staffed each post with an Indian [[Jemadar]] (approximately equivalent to a British [[Warrant Officer]]) and ten men, backed up by patrols operating 2–3 miles behind the line.&lt;ref name="moxham68"/&gt;  The line was mainly concerned with the collection of the salt tax but also collected tax on sugar exported from Bengal and functioned as a deterrent against [[opium]], [[bhang]] and [[cannabis]] smuggling.&lt;ref name="moxweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmoxham.freeserve.co.uk/maps.htm |title=Great Hedge of India Maps |last=Moxham |first=Roy |accessdate=29 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528172137/http://www.rmoxham.freeserve.co.uk/maps.htm |archivedate=28 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thornhill"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thornhill|1884}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maharaja of Jeypore|title=A Collection Of Treaties, Engagements And Sanads : Relating To India And Neighbouring Countries (Vol - Iii)|url=https://archive.org/stream/ACollectionOfTreatiesEngagementsAndSanadsRelatingToIndiaAndNeighbouringCountriesVolIII/TXT/0000%20-%200140.txt|website=Internet Archive|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British India salt revenue 1840-1877.png|thumb|Salt revenue 1840–77|left]]
The end of company rule in 1858 allowed the British government to expand Bengal through territorial acquisitions, updating the line as needed.&lt;ref name="moxham69"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1869 the government in [[Calcutta]] ordered the connection of sections of the line into a continuous customs barrier stretching {{convert|2504|mi|km}} from the Himalayas to [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], near the [[Bay of Bengal]].&lt;ref name="moxham69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham70"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This distance was said to be the equivalent of London to [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="Sleeman"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sleeman|1893}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The north section from [[Tarbela]] to [[Multan]] was lightly guarded with posts spread further apart as the wide [[Indus River]] was judged to provide a sufficient barrier to smuggling.  The more heavily guarded section was around {{convert|1429|mi|km}} long and began at Multan, running along the rivers [[Sutlej]] and [[Yamuna]] before terminating south of [[Burhanpur]].&lt;ref name="moxham70"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham71"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The final {{convert|794|mi|km|adj=on}} section reverted to longer distances between customs posts and ran east to [[Sonepur, Orissa|Sonapur]].&lt;ref name="moxham71"/&gt;

In the 1869–70 financial year the line collected 12.5&amp;nbsp;million rupees in salt tax and 1 million rupees in sugar duties at a cost of 1.62 million rupees in maintenance.  In this period the line employed around 12,000 men and maintained 1,727 customs posts.&lt;ref name="moxham70"/&gt;  By 1877 the salt tax was worth £6.3&amp;nbsp;million (approx 29.1&amp;nbsp;million rupees)&lt;ref&gt;see exchange table at [[History of the rupee#The fall of the Rupee]]&lt;/ref&gt; to the British government in India, with the majority being collected in the Madras and Bengal provinces, lying on either side of the customs line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/statistics/1867_excel/index.html|title=Statement showing the total consumption of salt in British India, the rates of duty, and the total amount of salt revenue in each of the under-mentioned official years.|work=Digital South Asia Library|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=29 April 2010|format=XLS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known when an actual live [[hedge]] was first grown along the customs line but it is likely that it began in the 1840s when thorn bushes, cut and laid along the line as a barrier (known as the "dry hedge", see also [[dead hedge]]), took root.&lt;ref name="moxham97"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=323–324 |title=Essays|editor=Haverfield, F|year=1911|url=https://archive.org/stream/essaysonromanhis00pelhuoft#page/323/mode/1up/| publisher=Clarendon Press|place=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1868 it had become {{convert|180|mi|km}} of "thoroughly impenetrable" hedge.&lt;ref name="moxham98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The original dry hedge consisted mainly of samples of the dwarf [[Flacourtia indica|Indian plum]] fixed to the line with stakes.&lt;ref name="moxham6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This hedge was at risk of attack by [[white ant]]s, rats, fire, storms, locusts, parasitic creepers, natural decay and strong winds which could destroy [[furlong]]s at a time and necessitated constant maintenance.&lt;ref name="moxham6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham106"/&gt; [[Allan Octavian Hume]], Commissioner of Inland Customs from 1867–70, estimated that each mile of dry hedge required 250 tons of material to construct and that this material had to be carried to the line from between {{convert|0.25|and|6|mi|km}} away.&lt;ref name="moxham99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The amount of labour involved in such a task was one of the reasons that a live hedge was encouraged, particularly as damage required the replacement of around half of the dry hedge each year.&lt;ref name="moxham99"/&gt;

In 1869 Hume, in preparation for a rapid expansion of the live hedge, began trials of various indigenous thorny shrubs to see which would be suited to different soil and rainfall conditions.&lt;ref name="moxham100"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The result was that the main body of the hedge was composed of Indian plum, [[Acacia catechu|babool]], [[karonda]] and several species of ''[[Euphorbia]]''.&lt;ref name="moxham7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Opuntia|prickly pear]] was used where conditions meant that nothing else could grow, as was found in parts of the [[Hisar district]], and in other places [[bamboo]] was planted.&lt;ref name="moxham101"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham102"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the soil was poor it was dug out and replaced or overlain with better soil and in flood plains the hedge was planted on a raised bank to protect it.&lt;ref name="moxham100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham101"/&gt;  The hedge was watered from nearby wells or rainwater collected in large, purpose built trenches and a "well made" road was constructed along its entire length.&lt;ref name="pelham323"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham100"/&gt;

Hume was responsible for transforming the hedge from "a mere line of persistently dwarf seedlings, or of irregularly scattered, disconnected bushes" into a formidable barrier that, by the end of his tenure as commissioner, contained {{convert|448.75|mi|km}} of "perfect" hedge and {{convert|233.5|mi|km}} of "strong and good", but not impenetrable hedge.&lt;ref name="moxham101"/&gt;  The hedge was nowhere less than {{convert|8|ft|m}} high and {{convert|4|ft|m}} thick and in some places was {{convert|12|ft|m}} high and {{convert|14|ft|m}} thick.&lt;ref name="moxham101"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham102"/&gt;  Hume himself remarked that his barrier was "in its most perfect form, ... utterly impassable to man or beast".&lt;ref name="moxham3"/&gt;

Hume also substantially realigned the Inland Customs Line, joining together separate sections and removing some of the spurs that were no longer necessary.&lt;ref name="moxham102"/&gt;  Where this happened, whole runs of hedge were abandoned, and the men would have to construct a hedge from scratch on the new alignment.&lt;ref name="moxham103"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The living hedge was terminated at [[Burhanpur]] in the south, beyond which it could not grow, and at [[Layyah]] in the north where it met the [[River Indus]], whose strong current was judged sufficient to deter smugglers.&lt;ref name="moxham105"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[Henry Francis Pelham]] compared the use of the Indus in this way to that of the [[River Main]], in modern Germany, for the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Limes Germanicus]] fortifications.&lt;ref name="pelham323"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pelham|1911|p=323}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Agra canal headworks1871a.jpg|thumb|Agra Canal construction work]]
Hume was replaced as Commissioner of Customs in 1870 by [[G. H. M. Batten]] who would hold the post for the next six years.&lt;ref name="moxham103"/&gt;  His administration saw little realignment of the hedge but extensive strengthening of the existing run, including the building of stone walls and ditch and bank systems where the hedge could not be grown.&lt;ref name="pelham323"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham103"/&gt;  By the end of Batten's first year he had increased the length of "perfect" hedge by {{convert|111.25|mi|km}}, and by 1873 the central portion between Agra and Delhi was said to be almost impregnable.&lt;ref name="moxham106"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham104"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The line was altered slightly in 1875-6 to run alongside the newly built [[Agra Canal]], which was judged a sufficient obstacle to allow the distance between guard posts to be increased to {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="moxham107"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Batten's replacement as Commissioner was [[W. S. Halsey]] who would be the last to be in charge of the Great Hedge.&lt;ref name="moxham107"/&gt;  Under Halsey's control the hedge grew to its greatest extent, reaching a peak of {{convert|411.5|mi|km}} of "perfect" and "good" live hedge by 1878 with a further {{convert|1109.5|mi|km}} of inferior hedge, dry hedge or stone wall.&lt;ref name="moxham108"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The live hedge extended to at least {{convert|800|mi|km}} and in places was backed up with an additional dry hedge barrier.&lt;ref name="moxham108"/&gt;  All maintenance work was halted on the hedge in 1878 after a decision was made to abandon the line in 1879.&lt;ref name="moxham108"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Staff ==
[[File:1stEarlOfNorthbrooke.jpg|thumb|Lord Northbrook, Viceroy of India during the peak of the Inland Customs Department]]
The customs line and hedge required a large number of staff to patrol and maintain it.  The majority of the staff were Indian, with their officers coming mainly from the British.  In 1869 the Inland Customs Department employed 136 officers, 2,499 petty officers and 11,288 men on the line, reaching a peak of 14,188 men of all ranks in 1872, after which staff numbers declined to around 10,000 as expansion slowed and the hedge matured.&lt;ref name="moxham109"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham113"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Indian staff were recruited disproportionately from the Muslim population, who constituted 42&amp;nbsp;percent of the customs men.&lt;ref name="moxham111"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The men were intentionally stationed in areas away from their home towns which, together with their removal of local wood for the hedge, made them unpopular among local people.&lt;ref name="moxham111"/&gt;  To encourage co-operation, those Indians who lived in villages near the line were allowed to carry up to {{convert|2|lb|kg|1}} of salt across for free.&lt;ref name="moxham111"/&gt;

The job of customs man was highly desirable due to its high pay of five rupees per month (agricultural wages were around three rupees a month), which could be topped up with the proceeds from the sale of seized salt.&lt;ref name="moxham114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=114}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However the men were forced to live away from their families in order to minimise distractions and were not provided with houses, being expected to build their own from mud or wood.&lt;ref name="moxham113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham112"/&gt;  In 1868 the Inland Customs department allowed the men's families to join them on the line, as the previous order had led to customs men straying from their posts and associating too closely with local women.&lt;ref name="moxham112"/&gt;  The men worked twelve-hour days consisting of two equal day and night shifts.&lt;ref name="moxham110"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The principal tasks were patrolling and maintaining the hedge; in 1869 alone the customs men carried out 18&amp;nbsp;million miles (29&amp;nbsp;million km) of patrols, dug 2&amp;nbsp;million cubic feet (57,000 cubic metres) of earth and carried over 150,000 tons of thorny material for the hedge.&lt;ref name="moxham109"/&gt;  There was a fairly high level of turnover in the staff; for example, in 1876-7 more than 800 men left the service.  This included 115 customs men who died on the line, 276 dismissed, 30 deserted on duty, 360 failing to rejoin after leave and 23 removed for being unfit.&lt;ref name="moxham114"/&gt;

The officer corps was almost entirely British; attempts to attract Indian men to the post proved unsuccessful, as the officers were required to be fluent in English, and such men could easily find better paid work in other fields.&lt;ref name="moxham110"/&gt;  The job was tough, with each officer responsible for 100 men on {{convert|10|to|30|mi|km}} of the line, and working through Sundays and holidays.&lt;ref name="moxham109"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham110"/&gt;  The officers undertook at least one customs excursion per day on average, weighing and applying tax to almost {{convert|200|lb|kg}} of goods, in addition to personally patrolling around {{convert|9|mi|km}} of the line.&lt;ref name="moxham110"/&gt;  The only other British men they would meet while on the line would typically be officers of adjacent beats and senior officers who visited about three times a year.&lt;ref name="moxham110"/&gt;

== Abandonment ==
[[File:University of Glasgow - Old and New, Robert Bulwer Lytton.png|thumb|Lord Lytton, pictured in 1890, ordered the abolition of the Inland Customs Line in 1879.]]
Several British viceroys considered dismantling the line, as it was a major obstacle to free travel and trade across the subcontinent.&lt;ref name="moxham72"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was partly due to the use of the line for the collection of taxes on sugar (which made up 10&amp;nbsp;percent of the revenues) as well as salt, meaning that traffic had to be stopped and searched in both directions.&lt;ref name="moxham112"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition the line had created a confusing number of different customs jurisdictions in the area surrounding it.
&lt;ref name="gazetteer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/CHANDRAPUR/bank_trade_history.html|title=History of Trade|publisher=Chandrapur District Gazetteers Department|accessdate=11 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410140151/http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/CHANDRAPUR/bank_trade_history.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The viceroys were also displeased with the corruption and bribery which was present in the Inland Customs system, and the way the line came to serve as a symbol of unjust taxes (parts were set on fire during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]).&lt;ref name="Thornhill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham71"/&gt;  However, the government could not afford to lose the revenue generated by the line and hence, before they could abolish it, needed to take control of all salt production in India, so that tax could be applied at the point of manufacture.&lt;ref name="moxham72"/&gt;

The Viceroy from 1869 to 1872, [[Lord Mayo]], took the first steps towards abolition of the line, instructing British officials to negotiate agreements with the rulers of princely states to take control of salt production.&lt;ref name="Dutt525"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutt|1904|p=525}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The process was speeded up by Mayo's successor, [[Thomas Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook|Lord Northbrook]], and by the loss of revenue caused by the [[Great Famine of 1876–78]] that reduced the land tax and killed 6.5&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref name="Dutt525"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham73"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Having secured salt production, British India's Finance Minister, [[John Strachey (civil servant)|Sir John Strachey]], led a review of the tax system and his recommendations, implemented by Viceroy [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], resulted in the increase of the salt tax in Madras, Bombay and northern India to 2.5&amp;nbsp;rupees per maund and a reduction in Bengal to 2.9&amp;nbsp;rupees.&lt;ref name="moxham74"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This reduced difference in tax between neighbouring territories made smuggling uneconomical and allowed for the abandonment of the Inland Customs Line on 1 April 1879.&lt;ref name="moxham74"/&gt;  The tax on sugar and 29 other commodities had been abolished a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chhabra|2005|p=393}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strachey's tax reforms continued, and he brought an end to [[import duty|import duties]] and almost complete [[free trade]] to India by 1880.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Strachey, Sir John |volume=25 |page=975}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1882 Viceroy [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Lord Ripon]] finally standardised the salt tax across most of India at a rate of two rupees per maund.&lt;ref name="India29"&gt;{{Harvnb|India Office|1911|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However the trans-Indus districts of India continued to be taxed at eight [[Indian anna|annas]] (½&amp;nbsp;rupee) per maund until 23 July 1896 and [[Burma]] maintained its reduced rate of just three annas.&lt;ref name="Dutt525"/&gt;&lt;ref name="danvers40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Danvers|1901|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The equalisation of tax cost the government 1.2&amp;nbsp;million rupees of lost revenue.&lt;ref name="danvers41"/&gt;  The potential for salt to be smuggled from the [[Kohat]] (trans-Indus) region meant that the north-western section of the line, some 325 miles long from Layyah to [[Torbela]], continued to be policed by the Department of Salt Revenue in Northern India until at least 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watt|2014|pp=420–1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on smuggling ==
The principal function of the line was to prevent smuggling, often the only way to procure affordable salt, and in this respect it was fairly successful.&lt;ref name="siddiky5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Siddiky|2006|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smugglers who were caught by customs men were arrested and fined around 8 rupees, those that could not pay being imprisoned for around 6 weeks.&lt;ref name="moxham115"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of smugglers caught increased as the line was lengthened and improved.  In 1868 2,340 people were convicted of smuggling after being caught on the line, this rose to 3,271 smugglers in 1873–74 and to 6,077 convicted in 1877–78.&lt;ref name="moxham114"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham118"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods of smuggling were employed.  Early on, when patrols were patchy, large scale smuggling was common, with armed gangs breaking through the line with herds of salt-laden camels or cattle.&lt;ref name="moxham116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=116}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the line was strengthened, smugglers changed tactics and would try to disguise salt and bring it through the line or throw it over the hedge.&lt;ref name="moxham116"/&gt;  Scams were also attempted with salt being hidden within the jurisdiction of the customs department to collect the 50&amp;nbsp;percent finders fee.&lt;ref name="moxham117"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=117}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clashes between smugglers and customs men were often violent, with the deaths of customs men in the line of duty not being uncommon. A large incident occurred in September 1877 when two customs men attempted to apprehend 112 smugglers and were both killed.&lt;ref name="moxham118"/&gt;  More than half of the gang were later caught and either imprisoned or transported.&lt;ref name="moxham119"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another customs man lost his life near [[Sohar, India|Sohar]] when he attempted, with seven colleagues, to capture a gang of 30 smugglers.  Fourteen of the gang were later captured and, again, imprisoned or transported.  Many of the smugglers also died, with examples including one killed by his fellow smugglers in a fight with customs men and another drowning while trying to escape by swimming an [[irrigation tank]].&lt;ref name="moxham119"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[File:John and Richard Strachey.jpg|thumb|Sir John Strachey (left) pictured in 1876]]
Writers have described the line as infringement of the principles of free trade and the freedom of the people of India.  Sir John Strachey, the minister whose tax review led to the abolition of the line, was quoted in 1893 describing the line as "a monstrous system, to which it would be almost impossible to find a parallel in any tolerably civilised country".&lt;ref name="Sleeman"/&gt;  This has been echoed by modern writers such as journalist [[Madeleine Bunting]], who wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in February 2001 that the line was "one of the most grotesque and least well known achievements of the British in India".&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bunting|first=Madeleine|authorlink=Madeleine Bunting|title=The profits that kill|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/12/wto.aids|accessdate=25 May 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff.jpg|thumb|left|M. E. Grant Duff]]
The massive scale of the undertaking has also been commented upon, with both Hume, the customs commissioner, and [[M. E. Grant Duff]], who was [[Under-Secretary of State for India]] from 1868 to 1874, comparing the hedge to the [[Great Wall of China]].&lt;ref name="pelham323"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moxham101"/&gt;  The abolition of the line and equalisation of tax has generally been viewed as a good move, with one writer of 1901 stating that it "relieved the people and the trade along a broad belt of country, 2,000 miles long, from much harassment".&lt;ref name="danvers40"/&gt; [[Sir Richard Temple, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Temple]], governor of the [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]] and [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay Presidencies]], wrote in 1882 that "the inland customs line for levying the salt-duties has been at length swept away" and that care must be taken to ensure that the "evils of the obsolete transit-duties" did not return.&lt;ref name="temple8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Temple|1882|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the customs line to maintain the higher salt tax in Bengal is likely to have had a detrimental effect on the health of Indians through [[Salt#Health effects|salt deprivation]].&lt;ref name="moxham133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The higher prices within the area enclosed by the line meant that the average annual salt consumption was just {{convert|8|lb|kg}} compared with up to {{convert|16|lb|kg}} outside the line.&lt;ref name="moxham128"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=128}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the British government's own figures showed that the barrier directly affected salt consumption, reducing it to below the level that regulations prescribed for English soldiers serving in India and that supplied to prisoners in British jails.&lt;ref name="moxham134"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The consumption of salt was further lowered during the periods of famine that affected India in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="siddiky4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Siddiky|2006|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is impossible to know how many died from salt deprivation in India as a result of the salt tax as salt deficiency was not often recorded as a cause of death and was instead more likely to worsen the effects of other diseases and hinder recoveries.&lt;ref name="siddiky4"/&gt;  It is known that the equalisation of tax made salt cheaper on the whole, decreasing the tax imposed on 130&amp;nbsp;million people and increasing it on just 47&amp;nbsp;million, leading to an increase in the use of the mineral.&lt;ref name="robertson65"&gt;{{Harvnb|Robertson|1880|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consumption grew by 50&amp;nbsp;percent between 1868 and 1888 and doubled by 1911, by which time salt had become cheaper (relatively) than at any earlier stage of Indian history.&lt;ref name="India30"&gt;{{Harvnb|India Office|1911|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Marche sel.jpg|thumb|Gandhi on the Salt March to Dandi of March 1930]]
The rate of salt tax was increased to 2.5&amp;nbsp;rupees per maund in 1888 to compensate for the loss of revenue from falling silver prices, but this had no adverse effect on salt consumption.&lt;ref name="danvers41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Danvers|1901|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The salt tax remained a controversial means of collecting revenue and became the subject of the 1930 [[Salt Satyagraha]], a civil disobedience movement led by [[Mohandas Gandhi]] against British rule.  During the Satyagraha Gandhi and others marched to the salt producing area of [[Dandi, Gujarat|Dandi]] and defied the salt laws, leading to the imprisonment of 80,000 Indians.  The march drew significant publicity to the [[Indian independence movement]] but failed to get the tax repealed.  The salt tax would finally be abolished by the [[Interim Government of India]], led by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], in October 1946.&lt;ref name="gandhi20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gandhi|1997|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The government of [[Indira Gandhi]] overlaid much of the old route with roads.&lt;ref name="moxham215"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=215}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rediscovery ==
Despite its scale, the customs line and associated hedge were not widely known in either Britain or India, the standard histories of the period neglecting to mention them.&lt;ref name="moxham3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Moxham]], a [[Conservator (museum)|conservator]] at the [[University of London]] library, wrote a book on the customs line and his search for its remains that was published in 2001.  This followed his finding, in 1995, of a passing mention of the hedge in Major-General Sir [[William Henry Sleeman]]'s work ''Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official''.&lt;ref name="moxham3"/&gt;  Moxham looked up the hedge in the [[India Office Records]] of the [[British Library]] and determined to locate its remnants.&lt;ref name="moxham4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moxham conducted extensive research in London before making three trips to India to look for any remains of the line.&lt;ref name="moxbook"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moxham |first=Roy |title=The Great Hedge of India |url=http://www.rmoxham.freeserve.co.uk/about%20the%20book.htm |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003062936/http://www.rmoxham.freeserve.co.uk/about%20the%20book.htm |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1998 he located a small raised embankment in the [[Etawah]] district in [[Uttar Pradesh]] which may be all that remains of the Great Hedge of India.&lt;ref name="moxham219"&gt;{{Harvnb|Moxham|2001|p=219}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moxham's book, which he claims to be the first on the subject, details the history of the line and his attempts to locate its modern remains.&lt;ref name="moxbook"/&gt;  The book was translated into [[Marathi language|Marathi]] by Anand Abhyankar in 2007 and into [[Tamil language|Tamil]] by Cyril Alex in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Abhyankar |2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kolappan|first1=B.|title=The hedge that denied Indians their daily salt|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/the-hedge-that-denied-indians-their-daily-salt/article7001351.ece|accessdate=11 January 2018|work=The Hindu|date=17 March 2015|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
[[File:Lex De Imperio Vespasiani - Palazzo Nuovo - Musei Capitolini - Rome 2016.jpg|thumb|A bronze tablet in the [[Capitoline Museums]] recording a law of the Senate now termed the "Lex de Imperio Vespasiani," establishing [[Vespasian]] in his imperial ''munus''. Section VI states that "whatsoever he shall think likely to promote the welfare of the state ... he shall have full right (ius) and authority (potestas) to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Fred B.R. | last=Hellems | title=Lex de Imperio Vespasiani: A consideration of some of the constitutional aspects of the principate at Rome, a Thesis | year=1902 | location=Chicago | publisher=Scott, Foresman and Company | pages=4–5 | url=https://archive.org/stream/lexdeimperiovesp00helliala#page/4/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''senatus consultum'' gives the emperor the absolute right to make decisions, a concept later adopted by the absolute monarchies of Europe. This legislation forestalled any questions about whether the emperor had a right to exercise the authority of the state in any way he pleased. In fact, such questioning was against the law as infringing on the emperor's rights. The death penalty was frequently invoked for such questioning, depending on the emperor (not under Vespasian, who was considered a good emperor).]]

'''''Ius''''' or '''''Jus''''' ([[Latin]], plural '''''iura''''')&lt;ref&gt;The Roman alphabet had no "j";  the Romans used "i" only. In the mediaeval period Latin words beginning with i + a vowel were back-formed with a j- to represent the y- sound. Dictionaries do or do not use the j- by editorial decision.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[ancient Rome]] was a right to which a citizen (''civis'') was entitled by virtue of his citizenship (''[[civitas]]''). The ''iura'' were specified by laws, so ''ius'' sometimes meant law. As one went to the law courts to sue for one's rights, ''ius'' also meant justice and the place where justice was sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Short|2007|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DJ%3Aentry+group%3D5%3Aentry%3Djus2 Jus]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the whole, the Romans valued their [[rights]] as the greatest good of Roman citizenship (''civitas romana''), as opposed to citizenship in other city-states under the jurisdiction of Rome but without Roman rights. Outsiders (''peregrini'') and freedmen (''libertini'') perforce used Roman lawyers to represent them in actions undertaken under the jurisdiction of Roman law. Representation was one of the civic obligations (''[[Munera (ancient Rome)|munera]]'') owed to the state by citizens. These ''munera'' (on which account the citizens were ''municipes'') included military service as well as paying taxes, but specialized obligations might also be associated with functions of elected offices or assigned by the government, such as paying the cost of road or aqueduct maintenance. Some of these functions were highly lucrative, such as tax collecting, since the collector collected much more than he owed the government, but for the most part functionaries were appointed for their wealth and were expected to assume the costs as their ''munus''. If they did not, they were tried and sometimes executed. Violation of the ''iura'' of other citizens, whether in office or out, was a serious matter, for which the punishment might be death.

==Meanings of ''ius''==
''Ius'' in [[Roman law|ancient Roman law]] had two principal meanings, which are still reflected in French ''droit'', German ''Recht'', English ''right'' and Castilian ''derecho''.&lt;ref name=Black675&gt;{{harvnb|Black|1910|p=675|loc=JUS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferdinand Mackeldy, 19th-century jurist, analyzed them into two principles: ''ius'' is the law, a set of compulsory rules (''Jus est norma agendi'', "law is a rule of conduct"), which he called objective or positive law, and a set of possibilities to act (''Jus est facultas agendi'', "law is a license to act"), which he called subjective law, or duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackeldey|Dropsie|1883|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Aequum et bonum''===
''Ius'' was defined by the jurists [[Publius Juventius Celsus]] and [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus]] as the ''aequum et bonum'', "the just and the fair", or justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berger|1953|loc=Ius (iura)| pp=525–526}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisprudence was the art of bringing it about through application of the laws; thus ''ius'' was law in the abstract, as in the English usage of the term "the law". ''Iura'' were "the whole of laws" (''iura populi Romani''), not a list of all the laws, but the very principle of legality, which might be applied through this law or by the magistrates and lawyers of Rome through disputation in the law courts. ''Ius'' might be something less than the whole body of law when special fields were designated by an adjective, such as ''ius publicum'', "public law," as opposed to private law.

The actual laws (''leges''), or written statutes, were only the specific tools through which ''ius'' was applied. ''Ius'' was the law in its broadest sense or its ideal state, above and unaffected by the contingent decrees that the state happened to enact—hence the distinction between the English terms justice and legislation. This division persists through various regimes of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] such as in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which distinguishes “due process of law” (singular, as in ''ius'') from “equal protection of the laws” (plural, as in ''leges'').

===''Jura et potestates''===
[[File:Bernard d'Agesci La Justice.jpg|thumb|left|A personification of justice by [[Bernard d'Agesci]]. ''La justice''  holds scales in one hand and in the other hand a book with "Dieu, la Loi, et le Roi" (God, the Law and the King) on one page and the [[Golden rule]] on the other page.]]
 
''Ius'' as the law was generally the domain of Roman aristocrats, from whose ranks the magistrates were chosen and who often defended clients in court. On a more practical basis, the populace of Rome daily encountered the primary meaning of ''ius''. They understood that they had rights. Furthermore, these rights could be named and enumerated in formulae beginning with the word ''ius'' followed by a descriptive phrase, most often in the genitive case: "the right of ...."

Black defines ''ius'' in the sense of a right as "a power, privilege, faculty, or demand inherent in one person and incident upon another."&lt;ref name=Black675/&gt; This power, or ''potestas'', was a license governing behavior between persons granted by the constitution. It determined what one citizen or group of citizens could or could not do regarding another; i.e., ''potestas'' is to be translated as authority, which the possession of ''iura'' gave to individuals. One might act socially ''sui iuris'', on one's own authority, asserting one's own right, or on behalf of another, ''alieni iuris'', in response to a demand to serve his right by being under his authority.

This was the principle binding soldiers in the army: the consul, or a commander of some other rank, had a right to demand public service of citizens in the army, who were then under his authority. The magistrates thus had the right and power to draft men into the army at any time, but this demand was never a private affair; the males were lawfully assembled and selections were made by the commanders of the units. Typically, the right to raise a legion from a given populace for a specified purpose under the [[Roman Republic]] had to be granted by a ''senatus consultum'', a decree of the Senate.

Similarly, under the [[Roman Empire]] the ''imperator'' ("commander") was from a legal point of view the chief magistrate whose major ''ius'' was the ordering of all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time. The cynical demands of the bad emperors and the beneficial ones of the good emperors are described at great length by the historians of the empire, such as [[Tacitus]].

The list below contains ''iura'' from different branches of Roman civilization. A ''ius'' of ancient Rome, marked by the imperial eagle, typically begins in the [[Roman Republic]] and continues through the [[Roman Empire]]. A ''ius'' of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] is marked with the [[double-headed eagle]]. The term is used in this article in the general sense to mean also the [[Carolingian Empire]], named after [[Charlemagne]], who had the title [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. His domain also included what is now France. Its ''iura'' reflect early Germanic laws. They are more likely to be found as legal principles in modern European countries. ''Iura'' that originated and remained primarily as [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] are marked with the [[coat of arms of the Holy See]].

| ''ius abstinendi'' with ''potestas abstinendi'' supplemented by the ''beneficium abstinendi''&lt;br&gt;[[File:Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg|left|50px]] || Right of refusal with the power of refusal supplemented by the privilege of refusal || [[Roman Republic]] on its claim based on the [[Twelve Tables]], supplemented by the [[Praetor's Edict|Praetorian Edict]], [[Roman Empire]] || In keeping with the high value placed by the Romans on family, they developed a complex system of transmitting family rights and property. That any family should disappear through lack of heirs was abhorrent.

An inheritance (''haereditas'') began with the rights (''iura'') and goods (''bona'') possessed by a citizen, regardless of whether there were any heirs to tenant it in the future. For the time being the citizen tenanted it. His civic duty was to find heirs (''haeres''). The preferred way to do this was to have children and designate them as heirs in a will (''testamentum''). These were ''voluntarii'' (or ''extranei'' or ''sui'') because they had the ''ius abstinendi'', carrying the power (''potestas'') of refusal. They might do that if the estate were hopelessly encumbered by debt. If the owner of the property died intestate, the law designated heirs, preferably other relatives, who were called ''necessarii'', because they had no right of refusal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Institutes and history of Roman private law with catena of texts | first=Carl | last=Salkowski | first2=E E | last2=Whitfield | location=London | publisher=Stevens | year=1886 | pages=857 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''haereditas'' was not automatically conferred on its ''heres'' as it is today. On the death of the testator the estate entered a pending period (''delatio'') during which the heirs must apply and either prove that they were qualified to be heirs or be disqualified. ''Voluntarii'' would state their intentions to accept or refuse at this time. If no qualified heirs were found, the ''haereditas'' reverted to the state, ending the family line, not considered a desirable outcome. The Praetorian Edict assigned the problem of finding heirs to the [[praetor]], a Roman magistrate, who could appoint a manager (''possessor bonorum''). Before he did, the will of a pending inheritance was considered to continue the testator. A possessor assumed title as though the will were his own. He was a ''necessarius'', but the praetor could grant him on application the ''beneficium abstinendi'', the privilege of refusing.

After the heirs were approved the estate entered the ''adquisitio'' phase. The ''testamentum'' was now of no effect. Roman wills never extended the testator. He and any possessor were vacated at this time. Joint heirs had to be all ''voluntarii'' or all ''necessarii''; mixed inheritance was not allowed. If no heirs had been found, the possessor kept the estate, as he had already vacated the testator.

|''ius abutendi''&lt;br&gt;[[File:Coat of arms of the Holy See.svg|50px]] || right to consume || Roman Catholic Church, 14th century on || Devised by [[Bertrand de Turre|Cardinal Bertrand de la Tour]] in support of [[Pope John XXII]]'s stance in his [[Papal bull|bull]], ''[[Apostolic poverty|Ad Conditorem Canonum]]'', issued 8 December 1322. The ''ius'', also known as ''ius consumendi'', builds on the Roman ''ius utendi'', asserting that not only does a possessor have the right to use his property as he sees fit, but also to consume it. This ''ius'' establishes that Christ and the apostles "had the right to use, use up, sell, donate or acquire" property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Thinking about property: from antiquity to the age of revolution | first=Peter | last=Garnsey | location=Cambridge; New York | publisher= Cambridge University Press | year=2007 | series=Ideas in context, 90 | pages=103–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| ''[[ius accrescendi]]''&lt;br&gt;[[File:Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg|left|50px]] || right of increase, accrual, accrescence or accretion || [[Roman Republic]], [[Roman Empire]] || In ancient Rome the right of accrual belonged to the joint heirs (''haeres''), male or female, of an expected inheritance (''haereditas''), whether to be transmitted by will (''testamentum'') or by law in the case of intestate inheritance. If any of the heirs should die or become ineligible to inherit for any reason before the death of the testator, the share of the other heirs increased by a percentage of the vacated share. This rule took precedence over any testament left by the deceased heir. Alternatives could be designated under some circumstances. There were exceptions and conditions, which required adjudication. Vacated shares for which heirs could not be found were forfeited to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colquhoun|1851|pp=247 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 9 AD the lex Pappia et Poppaea modified the Lex Julia of 18 BC (early empire), being called informally on that account the Lex Julia et Pappia Poppaea. It excluded a ''caelebs'', an unmarried person, male or female from inheriting unless he or she married within 100 days of the death of the testator. Also excluded were ''orbi'', or childless couples between 25 and 60 years of age for the male and 20 and 50 for the female. The intent of the law was to discourage childlessness. The emperor Justinian removed these conditions, restoring the republican form in favor of Christians who had decided to live celibate.

The ''ius'' is sometimes called the [[right of survivorship]], the modern term for the disposition of joint property to the survivors, dating from the Middle Ages. ''Accrescendi'', however, does not mean survivorship; moreover, the Roman use only covered the survival of joint heirs. Although general survivorship rules undoubtedly did develop from the ''ius accrescendi'', they are not the same as the Roman.

Subsequently it became a staple of civil law in the many nations descending from the [[Roman Empire]]. || The right to undertake an action against a person to compel performance of an obligated service or delivery of an owed thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colquhoun|1851|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans would have accomplished the same result with other ''iura'', typically under criminal law, as in a punitive action brought against a magistrate for non-performance of obligations.

The latter were maintained intact in order to support the army. They must therefore be inherited by one person (the knight), the elder by custom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cecil|1895|pp=27–32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Ius albanagii''. The right of confiscation of property of an alien, cf. ''droit d'aubaine'' (ius Albinatus).
*''Ius Albinatus''. In old French law. The ''droit d'aubaine'' in France, whereby the king, at an alien's death, was entitled to all his property, unless he had peculiar exemption. Repealed by French laws in June, 1791. cf:
::* Albanagium --  In old French law, the state of alienage, of being a foreigner or alien.
::* Albanus -- In old French law, a stranger, alien, or foreigner.
::* Albinatus -- In old French law, the state or condition of an alien or foreigner.
*''Ius angariae''. The right of [[angary]], i.e., in international law, the right of a belligerent to seize neutral ships in its territory and use them for transportation, should the need arise. Also, the right of a belligerent to seize, use, or destroy property of neutral states located temporarily in its territory or that of the enemy.
*''Ius anglorum''. The laws and customs of the West Saxons, in the time of the Heptarchy, by which the people were for a long time governed, and that were preferred before all others.
*''Ius aquaeductus''. In civil law, the name of a servitude that gives landowners the right to bring water through or from the land of another.

*''Jus banci''. In old English law, the right of bench&amp;mdash;the right or privilege of having an elevated and separate seat of judgement, anciently allowed only to the king's judges, who hence were said to administer high justice (''summam administrant justitiam''.) Blount.
*''Jus belli''. The law of war&amp;mdash;the law of nations, as applied to a state of war, particularly defining rights and duties of the belligerent powers themselves, and of neutral nations. The right of war; those actions that may be done without injustice, in regard to an enemy.
::*''Jus bellum dicendi''. The right of proclaiming war.

==C==
*''[[Jus canonicum]]''. Canon law
*''[[Ius civile]]''. In Roman law, the laws resulting from statutes and decrees governing the citizenry, as elaborated by the commentators of Roman law. According to the distinction employed by Gaius, the ''ius civile'' is the law applied only to Roman citizens; the ''ius gentium'' governed foreigners or was applied in cases involving both Romans and foreigners.
*''[[Civil law (area)|Jus civile]]''. Civil law. The system of law peculiar to one state or people. Inst 1, 2, 1. Particularly, in Roman law, the civil law of the Roman people, as distinguished from the ''jus gentium''. The term is also applied to the body of law called, emphatically, the "civil law."
:The ''jus civile'' and the ''jus gentium'' are distinguished as follows. All people ruled by statutes and customs use a law partly peculiar to themselves, partly common to all men. The law each people has settled on for itself is peculiar to the state itself, and is called ''jus civile'', as being peculiar to that very state. The law that has come to be generally accepted among all men—the law that is guarded among all peoples quite alike—is called the ''jus gentium'', "and all nations use it as if it were the law. The Roman people, therefore, use a law that is partly peculiar to itself, partly common to all men." Hunter, Rom. Law, 38.
:But this is not the only, or even the generally accepted, use of the words. What the Roman jurists had chiefly in view when they spoke of ''jus civile'' was not local as opposed to cosmopolitan law, but the old law of the city as contrasted with the newer law introduced by the praetor (''jus prœtorium, jus honorarium''). Largely, no doubt, the ''jus gentium'' corresponds with the ''jus honorarium'': but the correspondence is not perfect. Id. 39.
:*''Jus civile est quod sibi populus constituit''. "The civil law is what a people establishes for itself". Inst. 1, 2, 1; Jackson v. Jackson, 1 Johns. (N.Y.) 424, 426.
*''Ius civitatus''. The right of citizenship; the freedom of the city of Rome. It differs from ''jus quiritium'', which included all the privileges of a free native of Rome. The difference is much the same as between "denization" and "naturalization". Wharton.
*''Jus cloacae''. In civil law, the right of sewerage or drainage. An easement consisting in the right to have a sewer, or to conduct surface water, through the house or over the ground of one's neighbor. Macheld. Rom. Law, Section 317.
*''[[Ius commune]]''. In civil law, common right; the common and natural rule of right, as opposed to ''jus singulare''. Mackeld. Rom. Law, Section 196.

* ''Ius consumendi''. See ''Ius abutendi''.
*''Jus coronae''. In English law, the right of the crown, or to the crown; the right of succession to the throne. 1 Bl. Comm. 191; 2 Steph. Comm. 434.
*''Jus cudendae monetae''. In old English law, the right of coining money. 2 How. State Tr. 118.

*''Jus deliberandi''. In civil law, the right of deliberating. A term granted by the proper officer at the request of him who is called to the inheritance (the heir), within which he has the right to investigate its condition and to consider whether he will accept or reject it. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 742; Civ. Code La. art. 1028.
*''Jus descendit, et non terra''. A right descends, not the land. Co. Litt, 345.
*''Jus devolutum''. The right of the church of presenting a minister to a vacant parish, in case the patron shall neglect to exercise his right within the time limited by law.
*''Jus dicere''. To declare the law; to say what the law is. The province of a court or judge. 2 Eden, 29; 3 P. Wins. 485.

==G==
*''[[Jus gentium]]''. The law of nations.

Inst 1, 2, 1; Dig. 1, 1, 9; 1 Bl. Comm. 43; 1 Kent, Comm. 7; Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 125.
:Although this phrase had a meaning in Roman law that may be rendered by our expression "law of nations", it must not be understood as equivalent to what we now call "international law", its scope being much wider. It was originally a system of law, or more properly, equity, gathered by early Roman lawyers and magistrates from the common ingredients in the customs of the old Italian tribes{{mdash}}those being the nations, ''gentes'', whom they had opportunities of observing{{clarify|date=November 2013}}{{mdash}}to be used in cases where the ''jus civile'' did not apply; that is, in cases between foreigners, or between a Roman citizen and a foreigner. The principle upon which they proceeded was that any rule of law common to all the nations they knew of must be intrinsically consonant to right reason, and therefore fundamentally valid and just. From this it was an easy transition to the converse principle, viz., that any rule that instinctively commended itself to their sense of justice and reason must be a part of the ''jus gentium''. And so the latter term came eventually to be synonymous with "equity" (as the Romans understood it.) or the system of praetorian law.
:Modern jurists frequently employ the term ''ius gentium privatum'' to denote private international law, or that subject that is otherwise styled the "conflict of laws"; and ''ius gentium publicum'' for public international law, or the system of rules governing the intercourse of nations with each other as persons.
:''[[Ius gentium]]''. In early Roman law, the law followed by all peoples, closely akin to the ''ius naturale''. From this universal sense it was used more specifically to describe the international law that governed Rome’s relationship with other states. Following the works of Gaius, the term was employed more narrowly to represent the law that applied among foreigners, and among Romans and foreigners. Foreigners, and the legal relations of Romans with them, were governed by the ''ius gentium''.

==N==
*''Ius naturae''. Literally, “the law of nature”. In Roman law, a near synonym for ''ius naturale''—a law that is supported by natural reason, and so a law that is, or ought to be, respected by the laws of all nations. Thus, the ''ius naturae'' was said to support the ''ius gentium'' in its universal sense. However, even this relationship is not always congruent: famously, in the introduction to Justinian’s Institutes, slavery is forbidden by nature but allowed by the ''ius gentium''. Even so, there was the general sense, seized on increasingly from Roman writings throughout the Renaissance and early modern age, that civil law was to reflect the obligations of natural law, especially when natural law required freedom.
*''[[Ius naturale]]''.  The [[natural law]], or law of nature; law or legal principles, supposed to be discoverable by the light of nature or abstract reasoning, or to be taught by nature to all nations and men alike; or law supposed to govern men and peoples in a state of nature i.e., in advance of organized governments or enacted laws. This conceit originated with the philosophical jurists of Rome, and was gradually extended until the phrase came to denote a supposed basis or substratum common to all systems of positive law, and hence to be found, in greater or less purity, in the laws of all nations. And, conversely, they held that if any rule or principle of law was observed in common by all peoples with whose systems they were acquainted, it must be a part of the ''ius naturale'', or derived from it. Thus the phrases "''ius naturale''" and "''ius gentium''" came to be used interchangeably.
As the Roman jurist Ulpian said, “that which nature has taught all animals”. For most writings of classical Roman law, synonymous with ''ius naturae''. From the writings of Paul, however, the term ''ius naturale'' acquired the sense of an ideal of law, ''quod semper est bonum et aequum''{{mdash}}those actions that are always fair and just. This sense is followed in the Thomist conceptions of natural law, or ''lex naturalis''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30134">A '''lay judge''' is a person assisting a [[judge]] in a trial and as such are sometimes called lay [[assessor (law)|assessor]]s. Lay judges are used in some [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. [[Japan]] began implementing a new lay judge system in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lay judges in Japan]], retrieved on June 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Lay judges are appointed volunteers and often require some legal instruction. However, they are not permanent officers, as they tend proceedings about once a month, and often receive only nominal or "costs covered" pay. Lay judges are usually used when the country does not have [[jury|juries]]. Lay judges may be randomly selected for a single trial (like jurors), or politically appointed. In the latter case, they may usually not be rejected by the prosecution, the defense, or the permanent judges. Lay judges are similar to [[magistrates of England and Wales]], but magistrates sit about twice more often.

==In different countries==
=== Austria ===
{{further information|Judiciary of Austria}}

In criminal proceedings, lay judges sit alongside professional judges on cases carrying a maximum punishment of more than five years, as well as for [[political crime]]s. Lay judges are also used in labor, social, and commercial law disputes.

=== Brazil ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}

In Brazil, the Law Nº 9.099/1995 created the "Juizados Especiais" (Special Petty Courts), with restricted jurisdiction to settle small claims (understood as those with a "lawsuit worth" lower than 40 times the country's [[minimum wage]]) and/or criminal [[misdemeanor]]s (listed in the Executive Order Nº 3.688/1941). In this procedure, lay judges act under supervision of judges to preside over the court as well as to act as conciliators. Their decisions, called "''{{lang|pt|pareceres}}''", are submitted to the judge for homologation before it has any effects [[inter partes|between the parties]]. According to the law, lay judges must be selected among [[lawyers]] with more than 5 years of experience.

=== Germany ===
{{further information|Judiciary of Germany}}

Except for most crimes for which the [[trier of fact]] is a single professional judge, and serious [[political crime]]s which are tried before a panel of professional judges, in the [[judiciary of Germany]] all charges are tried before mixed tribunals on which lay judges (''{{lang|de|Schöffen}}''; a kind of lay judge or [[alderman]]) sit side by side with professional judges.{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=141}} Section 263 of the German Code of Criminal Procedure requires a two-thirds majority for most decisions unfavorable to the defendant; denial of probation by simple majority is an important exception.{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=141}} In most cases lay judges do not directly examine documents before the court or have access to the case file.{{sfn|Malsch|2009|p=137}}

The only statutory criteria is that lay judges must be citizens that have not been convicted of, or be under investigation for, a serious crime.{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=182}} However, people "ought not" to be chosen if they are under 25 years old or over 70 years old, very high government officials, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, policemen, ministers, priests, don't live in the community at the time of election, or have been a lay judge in the past two terms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gvg/__33.html § 33 GVG]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=182}} In addition, people may refuse to serve if they are over 65 years old, members of the federal or state legislatures, doctors, nurses, [[:wikt:druggist|druggists]] if working alone, housewives if overburdened, or have served as a lay judge in the preceding term.{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=182}} Applications can be made to become a lay judge by interested citizens, but this does not occur often, and welfare institutions, sports clubs, financial and health insurance institutions, trade unions, industrial companies and other [[:wiktionary:public authority|public authorities]] are primarily called upon to nominate candidates, and it appears that motivation includes social responsibility, image cultivation, advertising, and participation in [[fine (penalty)|fine]] allocation.{{sfn|Malsch|2009|p=137}}

Lay judges are selected by a selection committee from lists that are passed by the municipal councils (''{{lang|de|[[:de:Gemeinderat (Deutschland)|Gemeinderat]]}}'') with a two-thirds majority of attending local councilors.{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=182}}{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=153}} The selection committee consists of a judge from the [[Amtsgericht]], a representative of the state government, and ten "trusted citizens" (''{{lang|de|Vertrauenspersonen}}'') who are also elected by two-thirds of the municipal legislature, and selects from the list of candidates the number needed to staff the various tribunals.{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=182}}{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=153}} The practice was similar in [[East Germany]].{{sfn|Wolfe|1994|pp=503-504}}

Lay judges have historically been predominantly middle-aged men from middle class socioeconomic backgrounds, largely due to a selection procedure in which personal acquaintance, political affiliation and occupation all play an important role.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=153}}{{sfn|Vogler|2005|p=245}} A study conducted in 1969 found that, of the lay judges in its sample, approximately 25% were [[civil service]] employees, compared to only about 12% being [[blue-collar worker]]s.{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=183}} A study published in 2009 put this number at 27% civil service employees versus 8% of the general population, and noted the relatively high numbers of [[housewife|housewive]]s, the relatively low number of [[private sector]] employees, and relative old age of lay judges.{{sfn|Malsch|2009|p=137}}

==== History ====
Lay judges have been utilized in Germany throughout her early history and the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=137}} A [[Swabia]]n ordinance of 1562 called for the summons of jurymen (''{{lang|de|urtheiler}}''), and various methods were in use in [[Emmendingen]], [[Oppenau]], and [[Oberkirch (Baden)|Oberkirch]].{{sfn|Forsyth|1852|p=369}} [[Hauenstein]]'s charter of 1442 secured the right to be tried in all cases by 24 fellow equals, and in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Friburg]] the jury was composed of 30 citizens and councilors.{{sfn|Forsyth|1852|p=370}} The modern jury trial was first introduced in the [[Rhineland|Rhenish provinces]] in 1798, with a court consisting most commonly of 12 citizens (''{{lang|de|[[:wiktionary:Bürger|Bürger]]s}}'').{{sfn|Forsyth|1852|p=369}}

The system whereby citizens were tried by their peers chosen from the entire community in open court was gradually superseded by an "engine of tyranny and oppression" in Germany in which the process of investigation was secret and life and liberty depended upon judges appointed by the state.{{sfn|Forsyth|1852|p=371}} In [[Constance]] the jury trial was suppressed by decree of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in 1786.{{sfn|Forsyth|1852|p=370}} The [[Frankfurt Constitution]] of the failed [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolutions of 1848]] called for jury trials for "the more serious crimes and all political offenses",{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=137}} but was never implemented. An 1873 draft on criminal procedure produced by the [[Prussia]]n Ministry of Justice proposed to abolish the jury and replace it with the mixed system, causing a significant political debate.{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=139}}

The [[Kingdom of Hanover]] during the Confederation was the first to provide a mixed system of judges and lay judges in 1850, which was quickly adopted by a number of other states, with the Hanoverian legislation providing the model for the contemporary ''{{lang|de|Schöffengericht}}'' (lay judge or mixed court).{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=138}} The German code on court constitution called [[:de:Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz|Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz]] (GVG) of 27 January 1877 provided that the ''{{lang|de|Schwurgericht}}'' (jury court) would consist of three judges and twelve jurymen,{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=138}}{{sfn|Wolff|1944|loc=footnote 7, pp. 1069-1070}}{{sfn|Wolff|1944|p=1074}} alongside the mixed court, with the jury court reserved for serious crimes except political crimes.{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=139}} Lay judges were in use in the [[Bavaria]]n [[People's Court (Bavaria)|People's Court]] of November 1918 to May 1924,{{sfn|Bauer|2009}}{{sfn|Volksgericht|1924}}{{sfn|Fulda|2009|p=69}} and the infamous [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]].{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=141}}

The [[jury]] was abolished by the [[Emminger Reform]] of 4 January 1924,{{sfn|Kahn-Freund|1974|loc=footnote 73, p. 18}} ostensibly as an emergency, money-saving measure in a period of acute financial stringency,{{sfn|Vogler|2005|p=244}} during an [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] state of emergency and its [[enabling act#In Germany|enabling act]] caused by events surrounding the [[occupation of the Ruhr]].{{sfn|Mulligan|2005|p=173}}{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=64}} The emergency decree abolished the jury in the ''{{lang|de|Schwurgericht}}'' and replaced it with a mixed system of three professional judges and six lay judges, but kept the original name.{{sfn|Kahn-Freund|1974|loc=footnote 73, p. 18}}{{sfn|Vogler|2005|p=244}} In 1934, nomination of [[Jew]]s and [[Communist]]s as lay judges was forbidden, and selection was restricted to [[Nazi]] supporters.{{sfn|Vogler|2005|p=244}} Between 1948 and 1950 in [[Allied-occupied Germany|American-occupied Germany]] and the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], [[Bavaria]] returned to the jury trial as it had existed before the emergency decrees,{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=141}}{{sfn|Vogler|2005|p=245}} but they were again abolished by the 1950 Unification Act (''{{lang|de|Vereinheitlichungsgesetz}}'') for the Federal Republic.{{sfn|Casper|Zeisel|1972|p=141}}{{sfn|Vogler|2005|p=245}}{{sfn|Coutts|1966|p=251}} In 1974 the number of lay judges in the ''{{lang|de|Schwurgericht}}'' was further reduced from six to two and in 1993 the number of professional judges was reduced from three to two. {{sfn|Vogler|2005|p=245}}

Nowadays, ''Schwurgericht'' appears as embodiment for three special task areas of the ''Große Strafkammer'' (Grand Penal Chamber) at a ''Landgericht'' (medium court level of a German Federal Land's jurisdiction), and again consists of three professional and two lay judges.

Its three competences are &lt;br /&gt;
 
a) mainly heavy crimes resulting in death of a person (except negligence), or similar heavy crimes like inducing nuclear explosion, and crimes that may result in a punishment over four years, acting as first instance for those crimes,

b) for preventive detention decisions or official consignment to a mental hospital, and

c) if complexity or difficulty of the case requires a third professional judge.

While a ''Große Strafkammer'' can usually decide before or at start of a trial to limit itself to two professional judges and two lay jurymen, it cannot do so if it has to function in the above-mentioned three cases.
{{sfn|GVG§74|2013}}{{sfn|GVG§76|2013}} &lt;br /&gt;
 
In 1979, the United States tried the [[East Germany|East German]] [[LOT Flight 165 hijacking]] suspects in the [[United States Court for Berlin]] in West Berlin, which declared the defendants had the right to a jury trial under the [[United States Constitution]], and hence were tried by a West German jury.

=== Finland ===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2018}}

In Finland, two (previously and sometimes also today three) lay judges (''lautamies'', nominative pl. lautamiehet) are called in into serious or complicated cases in district courts, to accompany a professional, legally trained judge. The professional judge is the chairman of the panel, but otherwise the judges have equal rights. The aim is to introduce their "common sense of justice" into the process. Simpler cases are handled by one or three professional judges, and all Appeals Court, Supreme Court and administrative court judges are necessarily professional.

Lay judges are appointed by local municipal councils, in practice by negotiations between political parties, from volunteers. Each municipality elects a number of lay judges depending on its size, or two at minimum. The minimum qualifications are Finnish citizenship, full citizenship rights (i.e. may not be a dependent or in bankruptcy), 25–64 years of age when elected, and general suitability for the position. Lay judges must resign at the age of 68 at the latest. Officials of the judicial, law enforcement or corrections authorities, such as prosecutors, attorneys, policemen, distrainers or customs officers may not be elected as lay judges.

New legislation (2009) has limited the role of lay judges. They are employed only in serious criminal cases, which comprised 6% of cases in 2013. Instead, 29% of cases were handled in writing and 65% with a single professional judge. Almost all (&gt;94%) cases concerning homicides, child molestations and vandalism are handled with lay judges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/kotimaa/lautamiehet-21889&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly they always sat in for instance family law proceedings. On average, lay judges sit in session for 12 days a year, or 20 days at maximum.

=== Japan ===
{{main|Lay judges in Japan}}
A system for trial by jury was first introduced in 1923 under [[Prime Minister]] [[Katō Tomosaburō]]'s administration. Although the system generated relatively high acquittal rates,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, David T., Early Returns from Japan's New Criminal Trials, The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus, online 9-07-2009&lt;/ref&gt; it was rarely used, in part because it required defendants to give up their rights to appeal the factual determinations made.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Dobrovolskaia (trans.), The Jury System in Pre-War Japan:
An Annotated Translation of “The Jury Guidebook”
(Baishin Tebiki), Asia-Pacific Law &amp; Policy Journal, vol. 9, no. 2, http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_09.2_dobrovolskaia.pdf, p. 238 n.7.&lt;/ref&gt; The system lapsed by the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Haley, JO, The Spirit of Japanese Law, Univ. of Georgia Press, 1998, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, as a part of a larger judicial reform project, laws came into force to introduce citizen participation in certain criminal trials by introducing lay judges. Lay judges comprise the majority of the judicial panel. They do not form a [[jury]] separate from the judges, like in a [[common law]] system, but participate in the trial as [[Inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]] judges in accordance with the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal tradition, who actively analyze and investigate evidence presented by the defense and prosecution.

=== Norway ===
{{further information|Judiciary of Norway}}
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2018}}

In the [[district court (Norway)|district courts of Norway]], lay judges sit alongside professional judges in mixed courts in most cases.{{sfn|Malsch|2009|p=47}} In most cases, 2 lay judges sit alongside 1 professional judge. The court leader (''Sorenskriver'') may decree that a case have 3 lay judges sitting alongside 2 professional judges if its workload is particularly large or if there are other significant reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/1981-05-22-25/KAPITTEL_5-5#§293|title=Lov om rettergangsmåten i straffesaker (Straffeprosessloven). Femte del. Saksbehandlingens enkelte ledd.|language=Norwegian|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions are made by [[majority|simple majority]].{{sfn|Malsch|2009|p=47}}

Lay judges also serve during criminal cases in the [[Court of appeal (Norway)|appellate courts]]. For smaller cases, the court is convened with three professional and four lay judges. If the crime carries a maximum sentence of six years imprisonment or more, the lay judges are replaced with a jury. The jury is chosen from the same list as the lay judges, meaning that lay judges in the appellate courts also serve as jurors. If the jury finds the defendant guilty, the jury spokesperson, and three other jurors selected at random, serve as lay judges during the sentencing. In the few cases where the professional judges overturn the jury's verdict, regardless of whether the original verdict was one of guilt or innocence, the case is re-tried with three professional judges and four lay judges.

In the [[Supreme Court of Norway|Supreme Court]], there are no lay judges.

Lay judges are not totally representative of the population. Only 2.8 percent are under 30 years and 60 percent ar 50 years or more.

=== Soviet Union ===
Trial by jury was first introduced in the [[Russian Empire]] as a result of the [[Judicial reform of Alexander II]] in 1864, and abolished after the [[October Revolution]] in 1917.{{sfn|Terrill|2009|pp=438-439}}

Lay judges were in use in the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Riha|1969|p=641}} After a 1958 reform they were elected for 2 years at general meetings of colleagues at their place of work or residence, or at higher levels appointed by the soviet.{{sfn|Riha|1969|p=641}} The incidents of lay judges overruling professional judges was rare, and was officially reported in only 1 case by the late 1960s.{{sfn|Riha|1969|pp=641-642}} Unlike the juries of the United States, lay judges were not selected from panels that are cross-sections of the entire population, but selected by institutions in each district.{{sfn|Riha|1969|p=642}}

The [[jury trial]] was reintroduced in [[Russia]] in 1993, and extended to another 69 regions in 2003.{{sfn|Terrill|2009|pp=438-439}}

=== Sweden ===
{{further information|Judiciary of Sweden}}

In first- and second-tier Swedish courts, both in the general and the administrative hierarchy, politically appointed lay judges (''{{lang|sv|nämndemän}}'') sit alongside professional judges in district and appellate general and administrative courts, but decide virtually no civil cases.{{sfn|Terrill|2009|pp=248–249}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domstol.se/templates/DV_InfoPage____2367.aspx Courts of Sweden: District court judgment], retrieved on February 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Lay judges are always in the majority in [[District courts of Sweden|district courts]], whereas the professional judges are in the majority in the [[Courts of appeal in Sweden|appellate courts]].

[[Municipal assembly (Sweden)|Municipal assemblies]] appoint lay judges for the district courts and the [[County Councils of Sweden|county councils]] appoint lay judges for the appellate and county administrative courts.{{sfn|Terrill|2009|pp=248–249}} They are appointed for a period of 4 years, and may not refuse appointment without valid excuse such as an age of 60 years.{{sfn|Terrill|2009|pp=248–249}} Typically, a lay judge will serve one day per month in court during his or her tenure.

In principle, any adult can become a lay judge.{{sfn|Malsch|2009|p=48}} Lay judges must be Swedish citizens and under 70 years old.{{sfn|Terrill|2009|pp=248–249}} People that cannot be lay judges are judges, [[officer of the court|court officers]], prosecutors, police, attorneys, and professionals engaged in judicial proceedings.{{sfn|Terrill|2009|pp=248–249}} In practice, lay judges in Sweden are elderly, wealthy, and better-educated.{{sfn|Malsch|2009|p=48}} Lay judges are usually [[politician]]s with the local authority from which they are appointed, appointed in proportion to political party representation at the last local elections.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=299–300}}{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=306}}

The use of lay judges in Sweden goes back to Medieval times.{{sfn|Terrill|2009|pp=248–249}}

=== Yugoslavia ===
Lay judges were in use in the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], including the [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]].{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=32}} Yugoslav trial courts consisted of 1 judge and 2 lay judges or 2 judges and 3 lay judges.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=32}}{{sfn|Wilde|2010|p=85}} Yugoslav law did not specify the qualifications (or disqualifications), and it was noted in the report by [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] [[Elisabeth Rehn]] that in a particular case they were both retired police officers and one was reportedly a former head of the Criminal Investigation Department.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=32}}

Lay judges in the district and regional courts were traditionally appointed by the assembly of the relevant socio-political community. In 1991, Serbia completely centralized the Kosovar judges' appointment and dismissal, including lay judges.{{sfn|Kymlicka|Opalski|2001|p=142}}

{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}
A '''legal case''' is a dispute between opposing parties resolved by a [[court]], or by some equivalent legal process. A legal case may be either [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[criminal law]]. In each legal case there is an [[Plaintiff|accuser]] and one or more [[defendant]]s.

==Civil case==
A civil case, more commonly known as a [[lawsuit]] or [[Controversy (law)|controversy]], begins when a [[plaintiff]] [[file (legal)|files]] a document called a [[complaint]] with a court, informing the court of the wrong that the plaintiff has allegedly suffered because of the [[defendant]], and requesting a [[judicial remedy|remedy]]. The remedy sought may be money, an [[injunction]], which requires the defendant to perform or refrain from performing some action, or a [[declaratory judgment]], which determines that the plaintiff has certain legal rights. The remedy will be prescribed by the court if the plaintiff wins the case. A civil case can also be arbitrated through [[arbitration]], which may result in a faster settlement, with lower costs, than could be obtained by going through a trial. 

The plaintiff must make a genuine effort to inform the defendant of the case through [[service of process]], by which the plaintiff delivers to the defendant the same documents that the plaintiff filed with the court.

At any point during the case, the parties can agree to a [[settlement (law)|settlement]], which will end the case, although in some circumstances, such as in [[class action]]s, a settlement requires court approval in order to be binding.

===Family case===
Cases involving separation including asset division, support (a.k.a. maintenance or alimony), and matters related to children are handled differently in different jurisdictions. Often, the court's procedure for dealing with family cases is very similar to that of a civil case (it requires service and disclosure, and will issue judgments).

Divorce and separation from a spouse is one of the most stressful situations, as rated by the [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale#Adults|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]], and so family proceedings are increasingly being "divorced" from the often very formal and impersonal process of civil proceedings, and given special treatment.

==Criminal case==
{{Main article|Criminal case}}
[[File:CanadianCriminalCases.jpg|thumb|Canadian criminal cases]]
A [[criminal case]], in [[common law (legal system)|common law]] jurisdictions, begins when a person suspected of a crime is [[indictment|indicted]] by a grand jury or otherwise charged with the offense by a government official called a [[prosecutor]] or [[district attorney]].

A criminal case may in some jurisdictions be settled before a [[Trial (law)|trial]] through a [[plea bargain]]. Typically, in a plea bargain, the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge than that which was originally brought by the grand jury or prosecuter. A defendant who goes to trial risks greater penalties than would normally be imposed through a plea bargain.

==Common elements==
Legal cases, whether criminal or civil, are premised on the idea that a dispute will be fairly resolved when a [[legal procedure]] exists by which the dispute can be brought to a factfinder not otherwise involved in the case, who can evaluate [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to determine the truth with respect to claims of guilt, innocence, liability, or lack of fault. Details of the procedure may depend on both the kind of case and the kind of system in which the case is brought - whether, for example, it is an [[inquisitorial system]] or a solo

===Designation and citation===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Tochigi patricide case]]--&gt;
{{main|Case citation}}
In most systems, the governing body responsible for overseeing the courts assigns a unique number/letter combination or similar designation to each case in order to track the various disputes that are or have been before it. The outcome of the case is recorded, and can later be reviewed by obtaining a copy of the documents associated with the designation previously assigned to the case.

However, it is often more convenient to refer to cases{{spaced ndash}}particularly landmark and other notable cases{{spaced ndash}}by a title of the form ''Claimant [[wikt:v.|v]] Defendant'' (e.g. ''[[Arkell v Pressdram]]'').  Where a legal proceeding does not have formally designated adverse parties, a form such as ''[[In re]]'', ''Re'' or ''In the matter of'' is used (e.g. ''[[In re Gault]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford University Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities |url=http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/publications/oscola.php |publisher=Hart Publishers |edition=4 |year=2012 |isbn=9781849463676}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "v" separating the parties is an abbreviation of the Latin [[wikt:versus|versus]], but, when spoken in [[Commonwealth countries]], it is normally rendered as "[[wikt:and|and]]" or "[[wikt:against|against]]" (as in, for example, [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'').  Where it is considered necessary to protect the anonymity of a [[natural person]], some cases may have one or both parties replaced by a standard pseudonym ([[John Doe|Jane Roe]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'') or by an initial (''[[D v D]]'').  In titles such as ''[[R v Adams]]'', however, the initial "R" is usually an abbreviation for the Latin [[King|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]], i.e. for [[the Crown]]. (For an explanation of other terms that may appear in case titles, see the [[Glossary of legal terms]].)

'''Lucia de Berk''' (born September 22, 1961 in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]), often called Lucia de B., is a Dutch licensed [[Child health nursing|paediatric nurse]], who was the subject of a [[miscarriage of justice]].

In 2003, she was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] (for which no parole is possible under Dutch law)&lt;ref&gt;[http://vorige.nrc.nl/article2398117.ece More Dutch prisoners serving life without parole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925144936/http://vorige.nrc.nl/article2398117.ece |date=2015-09-25 }}, Barbara Rijlaarsdam, NRC Handelsblad, November 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; for four [[murders]] and three [[attempted murder]]s of patients in her care. In 2004, after an appeal, she was convicted of seven murders and three attempts. Her conviction was controversial in the media and amongst scientists, and was questioned by investigative reporter [[Peter R. de Vries]]. In October 2008, the case was reopened by the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands]], as new facts had been uncovered that undermined the previous verdicts. De Berk was freed, and her case was re-tried; she was exonerated in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2010/04/nurse_lucia_de_berk_not_guilty.php|title=Nurse Lucia de Berk finally found not guilty of murdering seven patients|date=14 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151645/http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2010/04/nurse_lucia_de_berk_not_guilty.php|archivedate=24 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dutch-court-acquits-lucia-de-berk-of-killing-patients-1944577.html "Apology for nurse jailed for murdering seven patients"], AP, ''The Independent'' 14 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charges ==
As a result of an [[Unnatural death|unexpected death]] of a baby (Amber) in the [[Juliana Kinderziekenhuis]] (JKZ, Juliana Children's Hospital) in The Hague on 4 September 2001, earlier deaths and [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]]s were scrutinised. Between September 2000 and September 2001 there appeared to have been nine incidents, which earlier had all been thought unremarkable but now were considered medically suspicious. Lucia de Berk had been on duty at the time of those incidents, responsible for patient care and delivery of medication. The hospital decided to press charges against De Berk.

== Life sentence ==
On 24 March 2003, De Berk was sentenced by the court in The Hague to life imprisonment for the murder of four patients and the attempted murder of three others. The verdict depended in part on a [[Statistics|statistical]] calculation, according to which the probability was allegedly only 1 in 342 million that a nurse's shifts would coincide with so many of the deaths and resuscitations purely by chance. De Berk was however only sentenced in cases where, according to a medical expert, other [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] was present or in which, again according to a medical expert, no [[Natural death|natural cause]]s could explain the incident.

In the appeal on 18 June 2004, De Berk's conviction for the seven murders and three attempted murders was upheld. The crimes were supposed to have taken place in three hospitals in The Hague: the Juliana Child Hospital (JKZ), the Red Cross Hospital (RKZ) and the Leyenburg Hospital, where De Berk had worked earlier. In two cases the court concluded that there was proof that De Berk had poisoned the patients. Concerning the other cases the judges considered that they could not be explained medically, and that they must have been caused by De Berk, who was present on all those occasions. The idea that only weaker evidence is needed for the subsequent murders after two have been proven beyond reasonable doubt has been dubbed chain-link proof by the prosecution and adopted by the court. At the 2004 trial, besides a life sentence, De Berk also received detention with [[Involuntary treatment|coerced psychiatric treatment]], though the state criminal psychological observation unit did not find any evidence of mental illness.

Important evidence at the appeal was to be the statement of a detainee in the [[Pieter Baan Center]], a [[Forensic psychiatry|criminal psychological observation unit]], at the same time as Lucia de Berk, that she had said during outdoor exercise: "I released these 13 people from their suffering". However, during the appeal, the man withdrew his statement, saying that he had made it up. The news service of the Dutch Broadcasting Foundation ([[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]]) and other media that followed the process considered the withdrawal of this evidence to be a huge setback for Public Prosecution Service ([[Netherlands law#Ministry of Justice|OM]]). A series of articles appeared over the following years in several newspapers, including  ''[[Vrij Nederland]]'' and the ''[[Volkskrant]]'', raising doubts about the conviction.

The case was next brought to the [[Hoge Raad der Nederlanden|Netherlands Supreme Court]], which ruled on 14 March 2006 that it was incorrect to combine life imprisonment with subsequent psychiatric detention. Other complaints were not taken into consideration, and the evidence from a re-analysis by a [[Strasbourg]] laboratory was not considered relevant. The Supreme Court gave the matter back to the Court in Amsterdam to pass judgement again, on the basis of the same factual conclusions as had been made before. Some days after the ruling of the Supreme Court, De Berk suffered a stroke and was admitted to the hospital of [[Scheveningen]] prison. On July 13, 2006, De Berk was sentenced by the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam to life imprisonment, with no subsequent detention in psychiatric care.

== Doubts ==
A committee of support for Lucia de Berk was formed that continued to express doubts about her conviction. [[Philosophy of science|Philosopher of science]] Ton Derksen, aided by his sister, [[geriatrician]] Metta de Noo-Derksen, wrote the Dutch language book ''Lucia de B: Reconstruction of a Miscarriage of Justice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ton Derksen|url=http://www.peterrdevries.nl/tekst/extraboekreconstructie.htm|isbn=90-8571-048-0|publisher=Veen Magazines BV|title=Lucia de B. Reconstructie van een gerechtelijke dwaling|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004220809/http://www.peterrdevries.nl/tekst/extraboekreconstructie.htm|archivedate=2008-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They doubted the reasoning used by the court and the medical and statistical evidence that was presented. See also the English-language article Derksen and Meijsing (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=637&amp;calcTitle=1&amp;title_id=10769&amp;edition_id=11891 The Fabrication of Facts: The Lure of the Incredible Coincidence, Ton Derksen and Monica Meijsing. pp. 39-70 in: Legal Evidence and Proof], H. Kaptein, H. Prakken and B. Verheij (eds), Ashgate, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-7620-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chain-link proof ===
Of the seven murders and three attempted murders finally attributed to De Berk by the court, the court considered two of them to be proven by medical evidence. According to the court, De Berk had poisoned these two patients. The court then applied a so-called chaining-evidence argument. This means that if the several attempted or actual murders have already been established beyond reasonable doubt, then much weaker evidence than normal is sufficient to establish that a subsequent eight "suspicious incidents" are murders or attempted murders carried out by the same defendant.

For the two murders found proven by the court in The Hague, many experts {{Who|date=April 2011}} do not exclude a natural cause of death. In the case where [[digoxin]] poisoning was alleged, and supposedly detected by independent measurements in two Dutch laboratories, the method used in those laboratories did not exclude that the substance found was actually a related substance naturally produced in the human body. The Strasbourg laboratory used a new method, a test of high [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] and [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]], and did not support the digoxin overdose hypothesis. In the second case, the intoxication could have been an overdose caused by a [[medical error|faulty prescription]]. For both children, it was not clear how and when De Berk was able to administer the poison. Regarding the digoxin case, the prosecution gave a detailed reconstruction of the timing. However, other parts of the evidence discarded by the prosecution showed by the time-stamp on a certain monitor that at the alleged moment of poisoning De Berk was not with the patient at all, and that the specialist and his assistant were with the patient at that time.

The prosecution initially charged De Berk of causing thirteen deaths or medical emergencies. In court, the defence was able to show definitively that De Berk could not have been involved at all in several of these cases. For instance, she had been away for several days; the idea that she was there was due to administrative errors. Furthermore, all deaths had been registered as natural, with the exception of the last event. Even that last event was initially thought to be a [[death by natural causes]] by the doctors responsible for the child, but within a day, on being connected by other hospital authorities with De Berk and her repeated presence at recent incidents, it became classified as an unnatural death.

=== Statistical arguments ===
The court made heavy use of statistical calculations to achieve its conviction. In a 2003 TV special of ''[[Nova (Dutch TV series)|NOVA]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novatv.nl/index.cfm?ln=nl&amp;fuseaction=videoaudio.details&amp;reportage_id=4874 Statistiek in het strafproces] NOVA/Den Haag Vandaag, 4 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch professor of Criminal Law Theo de Roos stated: "In the Lucia de B. case statistical evidence has been of enormous importance. I do not see how one could have come to a conviction without it". The law psychologist Henk Elffers, who was used by the courts as expert witness on statistics both in the original case and on appeal, was also interviewed on the programme and stated that the chance of a nurse working at the three hospitals being present at the scene of so many unexplained deaths and resuscitations is one in 342 million.

This value was wrongly calculated.&lt;ref&gt;Goldacre, Ben. [http://www.badscience.net/?p=392 "Losing the lottery/"] ''The Guardian''. 7 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; If one wishes to combine [[p-value]]s (right tail probabilities) of the statistical tests based on data from three separate wards, one must introduce a [[Fisher's method|correction according to the number of tests]], as a result of which the chance becomes one in a million.&lt;ref name="Collins et al."&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. Meester |author2=M. Collins |author3=R.D. Gill |author4=M. van Lambalgen |url=http://lpr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/mgm003v1 |title=On the (ab)use of statistics in the legal case against the nurse Lucia de B |year=2007 |journal=Law, Probability and Risk |doi=10.1093/lpr/mgm003 |volume=5 |pages=233 |issue=3–4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829084245/http://lpr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/mgm003v1 |archivedate=2009-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Discussion of Collins et al."&gt;[http://lpr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/mgm004v1 Discussion of Collins et al.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829121254/http://lpr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/mgm004v1 |date=2009-08-29 }} by David Lucy&lt;/ref&gt;

Biased reporting meant that even this lower figure was invalid. Events were attributed to De Berk once suspicions began to fall on her, which could not have had anything to do with her in reality. The statisticians [[Richard D. Gill]] and Piet Groeneboom calculated a chance of one in twenty-five that a nurse could experience a sequence of events of the same type as Lucia de Berk.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, R.D., and Groeneboom, P. [http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~gill/hetero6.pdf "Elementary Statistics on Trial."] 31 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Dawid]], Professor of Statistics at the [[University of Cambridge]] (UK), stated that Elffers  "made very big mistakes. He was not sufficiently professional to ask where the data came from and how accurate the data were. Even granted the data were accurate, he did some statistical calculations of a very simplistic nature, based on very simple and unrealistic assumptions. Even granted these assumptions, he had no idea how to interpret the numbers he got".&lt;ref name="expert"&gt;[http://www.novatv.nl/index.cfm?ln=nl&amp;fuseaction=artikelen.details&amp;achtergrond_id=9907 "Expert on the most important proof in the Lucia de B. case: 'This baby has not been poisoned'".] ''NOVA''. 29 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of probability arguments in the De Berk case was discussed in a 2007 ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' article by Mark Buchanan. He wrote:
{{quote|The court needs to weigh up two different explanations: murder or coincidence. The argument that the deaths were unlikely to have occurred by chance (whether 1 in 48 or 1 in 342 million) is not that meaningful on its own - for instance, the probability that ten murders would occur in the same hospital might be even more unlikely. What matters is the relative likelihood of the two explanations. However, the court was given an estimate for only the first scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mark Buchanan | journal=Nature | volume=445 | issue=7125 | title=Statistics: conviction by numbers | pages=254–255 | date=18 January 2007 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v445/n7125/pdf/445254a.pdf | doi=10.1038/445254a | pmid=17230166 | bibcode=2007Natur.445..254B}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the initiative of [[Richard D. Gill]], a petition for a reopening of the Lucia de Berk case was started. On 2 November 2007 the signatures were presented to the Minister of Justice, [[Ernst Hirsch Ballin]], and the State Secretary of Justice, [[Nebahat Albayrak]]. Over 1300 people signed the petition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwi.nl/pr/press-releases/2007/pb-petitieGrunwald-011107.html Persbericht CWI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408192403/http://www.cwi.nl/pr/press-releases/2007/pb-petitieGrunwald-011107.html |date=2008-04-08 }} Petitie 2 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diary ===
Lucia de Berk's [[personal journal|diary]] also played a role in her conviction. On the day of death of one of her patients (an elderly lady in a terminal stage of cancer) she wrote that she had 'given in to her compulsion'. She wrote on other occasions that she had a 'very great secret' and that she was concerned about 'her tendency to give in to her compulsion'. De Berk has stated that these were references to her passion for reading tarot cards, which she explains she did secretly because she did not believe it appropriate to the clinical setting of a hospital. However, the court decided they were evidence that she had [[euthanasia|euthanised]] the patients. According to the court, the reading of cards does not accord with a 'compulsion' nor with 'perhaps an expression of fatigue', as she described it at the time. De Berk's daughter Fabiënne stated in an interview on the television program ''Pauw &amp; Witteman'' that some of her mother's notes in the diaries are 'pure fiction' which she intended to use in writing a thriller.

=== Dutch Forensic Institute report ===
After the appeal proceedings were closed, but before the judges delivered their verdict, the Public Prosecution Service received, via the [[Netherlands Forensic Institute]] (NFI), a report from a forensic laboratory in Strasbourg on the evidence for digoxin poisoning. The report subsequently lay in a drawer of the NFI for two years, but it did turn up in time for the final evaluation of the case before the Supreme Court. According to the Public Prosecution, the report contained no new facts, but according to De Berk's defence the report proved that there was not a lethal concentration of digoxin in the first case. The Supreme Court accepts the facts reported by the judges at the appeal court, and is concerned only with jurisprudence and correctness of the sentence, given those facts. The report therefore was not admitted into the final considerations of the sentence given to De Berk.

=== Posthumus II Commission ===
In general, in the [[Law of the Netherlands|Dutch legal system]], cases are not re-opened unless a new fact, called a ''novum'', is found. New interpretations by experts of old facts and data are generally not considered a ''novum''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc.nl/binnenland/article802533.ece/Gerechtshof_wil_niet_horen_van_rechterlijke_fouten nrc.nl - Binnenland - Gerechtshof wil niet horen van rechterlijke fouten]&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of this, Ton Derksen submitted his and Metta de Noo's research on the case to the Posthumus II Commission. This ad hoc, non-permanent commission examines selected closed cases and looks for evidence of errors in the police investigation indicating "[[tunnel vision (metaphor)|tunnel vision]]" and misunderstanding of scientific evidence. Derksen pointed out that the medical experts who had ruled out the possibility of death by natural causes had not been given all relevant information, that the hypothesis of digoxin poisoning was disproven, in particular by the Strasbourg analysis, and that the statistical data were biased and the analysis incorrect, and the conclusions drawn from it invalid. The commission announced on 19 October 2006 that this was one of the few cases it would consider in detail. Three men, recruited by the Public Prosecution service from the full Posthumus II committee, considered the following matters, having been instructed to focus on possible blemishes in the criminal investigation:

*Whether there were also unexplained deaths when Lucia de Berk was not present, unknown to the public prosecutor.
*Whether the expert witnesses were given all relevant available information.
*Whether scientific knowledge now threw a different light on the digoxin question.

In October 2007, the commission released its report&lt;ref name="rechtspraak.nl"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Actualiteiten/Hoge+Raad+verklaart+de+aanvrage+tot+herziening+in+de+zaak+Lucia+de+B+gegrond.htm |title=Hoge Raad verklaart de aanvrage tot herziening in de zaak Lucia de B gegrond |language=Dutch |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=12 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213100702/http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Actualiteiten/Hoge+Raad+verklaart+de+aanvrage+tot+herziening+in+de+zaak+Lucia+de+B+gegrond.htm |archivedate=13 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.om.nl/onderwerpen/@143445/rapport_commissie/ Rapport Commissie evaluatie afgesloten strafzaken inzake mevrouw de B.] October 29, 2007 (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://luciadeb.nl/english/archives/grimbergen-report.html Report of the CEAS triumvirate in the case against Mrs. de B.] October 29, 2007 (partial English translation)&lt;/ref&gt; and recommended that the case be re-opened.

In particular, the same persons, chosen from close circles of the hospital authorities rather than on the basis of recognised relevant expertise, had first helped the hospital in its internal investigations, then had advised the police, and finally had appeared before the courts as independent scientific experts. They noted that there was strong disagreement concerning whether or not baby Amber had died of digoxin poisoning. On 2 April 2008, De Berk was released for three months because after re-examination of the death of the last "victim", a natural death could no longer be ruled out.

== Case reopened ==
On 17 June 2008, the Advocate-General of the Supreme Court, G. Knigge, made a request for the Supreme Court to reopen the case. On 7 October 2008 the court acceded to his request, acknowledging that new facts uncovered by Knigge substantially undermined earlier evidence.&lt;ref name="rechtspraak.nl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NRC [http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2013289.ece/New_trial_for_nurse_convicted_of_seven_killings "New trial for nurse convicted of seven killings"] October 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, an independent team of medical researchers with access to all available medical information had reported to Advocate-General Knigge that the death which sparked the case appears to have been a natural death. The key toxicologist of the earlier trials had agreed with the new medical findings, pointing out that at the time of the trial, the court had only given him partial information about the medical state of the child. De Berk's statements about her doings on the night of that child's death had also been shown to be correct; indeed, during the period in which the courts had earlier concluded that she must have administered poison, the baby was actually being treated by a medical specialist and his assistant.

De Berk was allowed to remain free while awaiting a retrial at the Court of [[Arnhem]], which first adjourned while further investigations were made. The public prosecution had asked for extensive new forensic investigations, but this request was turned down by the court. Instead it commissioned further independent medical investigations into the cases of two more of the children, again allowing a multidisciplinary medical team access to all possible medical data concerning the children. At a session on 9 December 2009, the court stated that new integral medical investigations of the last nine months had confirmed that the cases of Amber, Achmed and Achraf were all natural deaths/incidents. These were the only cases where there was previously claimed proof of De Berk's culpability.

The appeal hearing ended on 17 March 2010. Witnesses heard on the final day stated that the deaths at the Juliana Children's hospital were natural, sometimes caused by wrong treatment or bad hospital management, and sometimes unexpected because of faulty medical diagnosis. The behaviour of the nurses, including De Berk, during a couple of medical crises turned out to have been swift and effective, saving lives on several occasions. The Public Prosecution capitulated, formally requesting the court to deliver a not guilty verdict.  On 14 April 2010, the court delivered the not guilty verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.limburger.nl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100414/ANPNIEUWS01/100419836/1056#Rechtbank_spreekt_Lucia_de_B._vrij_van_moorden|title=Rechtbank spreekt Lucia de B. vrij van moorden|language=Dutch|date=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the new finding of allegedly very high digoxin levels in autopsy blood in a child who was under the care of Lucia de Berk that resulted in her second conviction and life sentence for murder, i.e., at the 2004 appeal hearings. Moreover, this was despite it already being known at that time that digoxin levels on autopsy blood should be expected to be far higher than blood digoxin in a living patient. Living heart cells extract digoxin from the blood, concentrating it at levels up to 1,000 times the therapeutic digoxin levels in the circulating blood.  Heart cells die within minutes after death, allowing this digoxin to diffuse into the blood in the heart and in the surrounding large blood vessels – the sites from which blood is extracted by pathologists for blood chemistry analysis. Moreover, the autopsy blood did not originate from a proper blood sample but was squeezed out of a piece of gauze left inside the body after two autopsies had disturbed all the organs.

Without the misinterpretation of the autopsy blood digoxin levels, there would not have been any consideration of digoxin poisoning – and no criminal investigation would have occurred. Furthermore, a chemical used in pharmaceutical natural rubber (in syringes, ampoule seals and I.V. apparatus) manufacture, MBT (mercapto-benzothiazole), leaches into injections (Ref. 1)(Ref. 1: J.H. Meek and B.R. Pettit, Avoidable accumulation of potentially toxic levels of bezothiazoldes in babies receiving intravenous therapy;Lancet, 1985, Vol. 2, pp 1090–1092). It can cause death as a cumulative toxin (Ref. 1), or from anaphylaxis. MBT is measured as digoxin (Ref. 2:J.J.Reepmeyer, Y. H. Jule, "Contamination of Injectable solutions with 2-mercaptobenzothiazole from rubber closures", The Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Vol. 72, 1983, pp 1302–1305), using the test methods applied in the criminal investigations of Lucia de Berk and of a Canadian nurse, Susan Nelles.

Susan Nelles was similarly [[Toronto hospital baby deaths|charged with murder of children]] by digoxin poisoning at the Toronto Hospital for Sick Children in 1981. She was not convicted because, as in the de Berk case, all the evidence was circumstantial. It was not until 1993 that the causes for high digoxin on autopsy blood were explained in the Canadian Nurse Journal.   The causes of high autopsy blood digoxin are discussed thoroughly in a 2011 book, “The Nurses are Innocent – The Digoxin Poisoning Fallacy” (Dundurn Press, Toronto). This book presents facts in defense of Susan Nelles which apply similarly to the false charge of digoxin poisoning directed against Lucia de Berk.

== Compensation ==
On 12 November 2010, it was revealed that De Berk had received an undisclosed amount of compensation from the Ministry of Justice. The news was first broadcast by a local TV station in the West of the Netherlands. It was later confirmed by the ministry to the Dutch news agency [[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau|ANP]].

[[File:Convention du Mètre.png|thumb|350px|Metre Convention signatories: {{Legend|red|Member states}}{{Legend|LightPink|Associates}}{{Legend|DarkGreen|Former member states}}]]
The '''Metre Convention''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Convention du Mètre}}), also known as the '''Treaty of the Metre''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/378767/Treaty-of-the-Metre
|title = Treaty of the Metre
|publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]
|accessdate = 28 March 2013
|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[international treaty]] that was signed in Paris on 20 May 1875 by representatives of 17 nations (Argentina, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, United States of America, and Venezuela). The treaty created the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] ([[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|BIPM]]), an [[intergovernmental organization]] under the authority of the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] ([[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]]) and the supervision of the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] ([[International Committee for Weights and Measures|CIPM]]), that coordinates international [[metrology]] and the development of the [[metric system]].

As well as founding the BIPM and laying down the way in which the activities of the BIPM should be financed and managed, the Metre Convention established a permanent organizational structure for member governments to act in common accord on all matters relating to units of measurement.

The three organs of the BIPM are:

*The [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (''Conférence générale des poids et mesures'' or CGPM) – the plenary organ of the BIPM which consists of the delegates of all the contracting Governments;
*The [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (''Comité international des poids et mesures'' or CIPM)&amp;nbsp;– the direction and supervision body of the BIPM that is made of 18 prominent metrologists from 18 different Member States;
*The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (''Bureau international des poids et mesures'' or BIPM)&amp;nbsp;– the headquarters of the BIPM located at [[Sèvres]], France that has custody of the [[Kilogram#International prototype kilogram|International Prototype Kilogram]] and houses the secretariat for this organization and hosts its formal meetings.

Only States can be Members as per the Metre Convention. In addition to Member status, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) created in 1999 the status of Associate of the CGPM open to States and Economic Entities to enable them to participate in some activities of the BIPM through their National Metrology Institutes (NMIs). Membership of the convention requires payment of substantial fees. Failure to pay these over a span of years, without any expectation of a payment agreement, has caused a number of nations such as [[North Korea]] to be removed from the protocol. As of 7 August 2018, there are [[General Conference on Weights and Measures#Member States|60 Member States]] and [[General Conference on Weights and Measures#Associates|42 Associate State and Economies]].

Initially the Metre Convention was only concerned with the units of mass and length but, in 1921, at the 6th meeting of the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM), it was revised and it extended the scope and responsibilities of the BIPM to other fields in physics. In 1960, at the 11th meetings of the CGPM, the system of units it had established was named the [[International System of Units]], with the abbreviation [[International System of Units|SI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/history-si/|title=BIPM - history|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Poids et mesures.png|thumb|250px|Woodcut dated 1800 illustrating the new decimal units which became the legal norm across all France on 4 November 1800]]
Before the [[French Revolution]], which started in 1789, [[Units of measurement in France|French units of measurement]] were based on the [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] system, introduced by the first [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]] (800 – 814 AD) which in turn were based on ancient Roman measures. Charlemagne brought a consistent system of measures across the entire empire. However, after his death, the empire fragmented and many rulers introduced their own variants of the units of measure.

Some of Charlemagne's units of measure, such as the ''pied du Roi'' (the king's [[Foot (unit)|foot]]) remained virtually unchanged for about a thousand years, while others, such as the ''aune'' ([[ell]]—used to measure cloth) and the ''livre'' ([[Pound (mass)|pound]]) varied dramatically from locality to locality. By the time of the revolution, the number of units of measure had grown to the extent that it was almost impossible to keep track of them.

In England in 1215, clause 35 of the [[Magna Carta]] required that the same standards of measurement be applied throughout the realm. The wording of the clause emphasised that "There is to be a single measure ... throughout the kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document

From 1668 to 1776 the French standard of length was the [[Toise]] of Châtelet which was fixed outside the [[Grand Châtelet]] in Paris. In 1735 two geodetic standards were calibrated against the Toise of Châtelet. One of them, the Toise of Peru was used for the [[French Geodesic Mission|Spanish-French Geodesic Mission]]. In 1766 the Toise of Peru became the official standard of length in France and was renamed Toise of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy]] (French: ''Toise de l'Académie''). In 1799, after the remeasurement of the [[Paris meridian]] arc (French: ''Méridienne de France'') between [[Dunkirk]] and [[Barcelona]] by [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]] and [[Pierre Méchain|Mechain]], the metre was defined as 3 ''[[pied]]s'' (french feet) and 11.296 ''[[ligne]]s'' (lines) of the Toise of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Profusion of units of measures was a problem of importance before the [[French Revolution]] and its reform was one of the items on the agenda of [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entreprises.gouv.fr/metrologie/histoire-metre|title=Histoire du mètre|work=Direction Générale des Entreprises (DGE)|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]], an influential leader of the Assembly invited British and American participation in the establishment of a new system, but in the event, the Assembly went it alone and introduced the metre and the [[kilogram]] which were to form the basis of the metric system, manufacturing prototypes which, in 1799, were lodged with Archives.&lt;ref name= McGreevy1/&gt;

The [[Helvetic Republic]] adopted the [[metric system]] in 1803.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1805 a Swiss immigrant [[Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler]] brought copies of the French metre and kilogram in the United States. In 1830 the [[United States Congress|Congress]] decided to create uniform standards for length and weight in the United States. [[Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler|Hassler]] was mandated to work out the new standards and proposed to adopt the metric system. The United States Congress opted for the [[British Parliamentary Standard]] from 1758 and the Troy Pound of [[Great Britain]] from 1824 as length and weight standards. Nevertheless, the primary baseline of the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|U.S Coast Survey]] was measured in 1834 at [[Fire Island]] using four two-metre iron bars constructed after [[Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler|Hassler]]'s specification in the [[United Kingdom]] and brought back in the United States in 1815. All distances measured in the U.S. National Geodetic Survey were referred to the metre.

Between 1840 and 1870, a number of countries definitively adopted the metric system as their system of measure including France, Spain, many South American republics and many of the Italian and German states (the Netherlands had adopted the system in 1817).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In 1863, the [[International Postal Union]] used grams to express permitted weights of letters.

In 1852 the Spanish Government was urged by the [[Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences]] to approve the creation of a large-scale map of Spain. The following year [[Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero]] was appointed to undertake this task. All the scientific and technical material had to be created. Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero and [[Frutos Saavedra Meneses|Saavedra]] went to Paris to supervise the production by Brunner of a four metres long measuring instrument which they had devised and which they later compared with [[Jean-Charles de Borda|Borda]]'s double-toise N°1 which was the main reference for measuring all geodetic bases in France and whose length was 3.8980732 metres.

In 1867 at the second General Conference of the&amp;nbsp;[[International Association of Geodesy]] (German: ''Europäische Gradmessung'')&amp;nbsp;held in [[Berlin]], the question of international standard of length was discussed in order to combine the measurements made in different countries to determine the size and shape of the earth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iag-aig.org/index.php?tpl=text&amp;id_c=80&amp;id_t=143|title=A Note on the History of the IAG|website=IAG Homepage|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference recommended the adoption of the metric system (replacing [[Friedrich Bessel|Bessel]]'s toise, a copy of the Toise of Peru made in 1823) and the creation of an International Metre Commission.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Alexander Ross|date=1867-01-01|title=X.

In the 1860s, inspections of the prototype metre revealed wear and tear at the measuring faces of the bar and also that the bar was wont to flex slightly when in use.&lt;ref name= McGreevy1&gt;{{cite book

In July 1870, two weeks before the conference was due to start, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] broke out. Although the delegates did meet (without a German delegation), it was agreed that the conference should be recalled once all the delegates (including the German delegation) were present. The International Metre Commission was established in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/history-si/international-metre-commission.html|title=BIPM - International Metre Commission|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the war, which resulted in Napoleon III's exile, Germany and Italy, now unified nations, adopted the metric system as their national system of units, but with the prototype copy of the kilogram and metre under the control of the [[Third French Republic]]. In 1872 the new republican government reissued the invitations and in 1875 scientists from thirty European and American countries met in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== 1875 conference==
The principal tasks facing the delegates at the 1875 conference was the replacement of the existing metre and kilogram artefacts that were held by the French Government and the setting up of an organisation to administer the maintenance of standards around the globe. The conference did not concern itself with other units of measure. The conference had undertones of Franco-German political manoeuvring, particularly since the French had been humiliated by the Prussians during the war a few years previously. Although France lost control of the metric system, they ensured that it passed to international rather than German control and that the international headquarters were located in Paris.&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt; Spain notably supported France for this outcome and the first president of the International Committee for Weights and Measures, the Spanish geodesist, [[Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero]] received the [[List of foreign recipients of the Légion d'Honneur|Grand Officer medal of the Légion d'Honneur]] for his diplomatic role on this issue and was awarded the [[Poncelet Prize|Poncelet prize]] for his scientific contribution to metrology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.academie-sciences.fr/fr/|title=Carlos IBAÑEZ DE IBERO (14 avril 1825 - 29 janvier 1891), par Albert Pérard (inauguration d'un monument élevé à sa mémoire)|last=Pérard|first=Albert|date=1957|website=Institut de France Académie des Sciences|archive-url=http://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/eloges/ibanez_notice.pdf|archive-date=May 18, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, as [[Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero]] was collaborating with the French on the [[Paris meridian]] arc (West Europe-Africa [[meridian arc|Meridian-arc]]) remeasurement since 1853, and was president of both the Permanent Committee of the International Metre Commission since 1872 and the Permanent Commission of the [[International Association of Geodesy]] since 1874, he was to play a pivotal role in reconciling French and German interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soler|first=T.|date=1997-02-01|title=A profile of General Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero: first president of the International Geodetic Association|journal=Journal of Geodesy|language=en|volume=71|issue=3|pages=176–188|doi=10.1007/s001900050086|issn=0949-7714|bibcode=1997JGeod..71..176S|citeseerx=10.1.1.492.3967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Earth, Figure of the|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Earth,_Figure_of_the|journal=1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|volume= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Platinum-Iridium meter bar.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Historical ''[[International Prototype Meter|International Prototype Metre]]'' bar, made of an alloy of platinum and iridium, that was the standard from 1889 to 1960.]]
The conference was called to discuss the maintenance of international standards based on the existing French standards rather than using French standards which, at that time, were 70 years old and which, through wear and tear, might not be exactly the same as when they adopted in 1799.

Prior to the 1870 conference, French politicians had feared that the world community might reject the existing metre as it was 0.03% (300&amp;nbsp;µm) shorter than its design length, ordering a new [[Zonal and meridional|meridional]] measurement. They were eventually reassured when the German-born Swiss delegate [[Adolphe Hirsch]] said "no serious scientist would in our day and age contemplate a metre deduced from the size of the earth". When the conference was reconvened in 1875, it was proposed that new prototype metre and kilogram standards be manufactured to reproduce the values of the existing artifacts as closely as possible.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{cite book

Although the new standard metre had the same value as the old metre, it had an [[Henri Tresca|"X" cross-section]] rather than a rectangular cross-section as this reduced the flexing when taking measurements. Moreover, the new bar, rather than being exactly one metre in length was a little longer than one metre and had lines engraved on them that were exactly one metre apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The prototype metre was retained as the international standard until 1960 when the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of the orange-red line of [[krypton]]-86. The current definition of the metre is: ''"the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 of a second"''. 

On 16 November 2018, the 26th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) voted unanimously in favour of revised definitions of some [[SI base unit|SI base units]], in particular the kilogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2018/11/historic-vote-ties-kilogram-and-other-units-natural-constants|title=Historic Vote Ties Kilogram and Other Units to Natural Constants|last=Materese|first=Robin|date=2018-11-16|work=NIST|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new definitions are due to come into force on 20 May 2019, but do not change the metre.&lt;ref name=SI-statement/&gt;
&lt;ref name=bipm/&gt;

===Organisations===
The Convention created three main [[international organization|organizations]] to facilitate the standardisation of weights and measures around the world. The first, the CGPM provided a forum for representative of member states, the second, the CIPM was an advisory committee of metrologists of high standing and the third, the BIPM was an institute that provided appropriate secretarial and laboratory facilities in support of the CGPM and CIPM.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web

The structure may be compared to a [[corporation]]. The BIPM are the officers and employees, the CIPM is the [[board of directors]], and the CGPM is the [[shareholders' meeting]].

====General Conference on Weights and Measures====
The [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (''Conférence générale des poids et mesures'' or CGPM) is the principal decision-making body put on place by the convention. It is made up of delegates from member states and [non-voting] observers from associate states and economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to the Metre Convention (Art. 4) the President of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] is also the President of the General Conference on Weights and Measures.

====International Committee for Weights and Measures====
[[File:Metric seal.svg|thumb|200px|Seal of the BIPM]]
The [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (''Comité international des poids et mesures'' or CIPM) is made up of eighteen (originally fourteen)&lt;ref&gt;Convention of the Metre (1875), Appendix 1 (Regulation), Article 8&lt;/ref&gt; individuals from a member state of high scientific standing, nominated by the CGPM to advise the CGPM on administrative and technical matters. It is responsible for the running of ten consultative committees (CCs), each of which investigates different aspects of metrology – one CC discusses the measurement of temperature, another the measurement of mass and so on. The CIPM meets annually at Sèvres to discuss annual reports from the various CCs, to submit an annual report to the governments of member states in respect of the administration and finances of the BIPM and to advise the CGPM on technical matters as and when necessary. Each member of the CIPM is from a different member state – with France, in recognition of its work in setting up the Convention, always having one seat on the CIPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====International Bureau of Weights and Measures====
The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (''Bureau international des poids et mesures'' or BIPM) is an organisation based at Sèvres, France that has custody of the [[Kilogram#International prototype kilogram|International Prototype Kilogram]], provides [[metrology]] services for the CGPM and CIPM, houses the secretariat for these organisations and hosts their formal meetings. It also has custody of the former [[International Prototype Metre]] which was retired in 1960. Over the years the various international prototype metres and kilograms were returned to BIPM headquarters for recalibration services.

Initially it had a staff of 9, falling to 4 once the initial batch of prototypes had been distributed;&lt;ref&gt;Convention of the Metre (1875), Appendix 1 (Regulation), Article 6&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012 it had a staff of over 70 people and an annual budget of over €10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Headquarters, language and protocol===
[[File:BIPM courtyard.jpg|thumb|260px|Pavillon de Breteuil]]
The original treaty was written in French and the authoritative language of all official documents is French. Communication between the BIPM and member states is, in the case of France, via the French Foreign Minister and in the case of all other members, via the members' ambassador to France.&lt;ref&gt;Convention of the Metre, Appendix 1 (Regulations), Articles 16 and 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The French government offered the treaty members the [[Pavillon de Breteuil]] in Sèvres to house the BIPM. The Pavillon was originally built in 1675 on the estate of the Château de Saint-Cloud and was home to, amongst others, [[Napoleon III|Emperor Napoleon III]]. The château was all but destroyed during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–1) and the Pavillon badly damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Post 1875 developments==
The science of metrology has progressed vastly since 1875. In particular the treaty was amended in 1921 with the result that many other international organisations have a forum within the CIPM to ensure harmonisation of measurement standards across many [[Academic discipline|disciplines]]. In addition, what were originally conceived as standards for the purposes of trade have now been extended to cover a large number of aspects of human activity including medicine, science, engineering and technology.

===Extensions to the treaty (1921) and development of SI===
{{main|International System of Units}}
The metre convention was originally drawn up with the main purpose of providing a standards of length and mass only.  Standards relating to other quantities were under the control of other bodies – time was measured by [[astronomer]]s, electrical units by a series of ad-hoc international conferences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title = System of Measurement Units
|url = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/System_of_Measurement_Units
|accessdate = 1 October 2012
|publisher = [[IEEE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other physical standards and concepts were maintained or defined by international bodies such as [[International Congress of Applied Chemistry]] or the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]].

In 1901 [[Giovanni Giorgi|Giorgi]] published a proposal for building a coherent set of units based on four base units – the metre, kilogram, second and one electrical unit ([[ampere]], [[volt]] or [[ohm]]). In 1921 the Convention was extended to permit the promotion of standards relating to any physical quantity which greatly increased the scope of the CIPM's remit and implicitly giving it freedom to exploit Giorgi's proposals. The 8th CGPM (1933) resolved to work with other international bodies to agree standards for electrical units that could be related back to the international prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1948, three years after the end of the [[Second World War]] and fifteen years after the 8th CGPM, the 9th CGPM was convened. In response to formal requests made by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics and by the French Government to establish a practical system of units of measure, the CGPM requested the CIPM to prepare recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement, suitable for adoption by all countries adhering to the Metre Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The CIPM's draft proposal, which was an extensive revision and simplification of the metric unit definitions, symbols and terminology based on the MKS system of units, was put to the 10th CGPM in 1954. In the proposal the CIPM recommended that the ampere be the base unit from which electromechanical standards would be derived. After negotiations with the CIS and IUPAP, two further base units, the degree kelvin and the candela were also proposed as base units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The formal definition of International System of Units (SI) along with the associated resolutions passed by the CGPM and the CIPM are published by the BIPM on the Internet and in brochure form at regular intervals. The eighth edition of the brochure ''Le Système International d'Unités – The International System of Units'' was published in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MRA programme===
[[File:CIPM-MRA-logo.jpg|thumb|Logo used by laboratories that have been accredited under the CIPM MRA scheme]]
During the 1940s, the United States government recognised the benefits of its suppliers keeping [[quality control]] records in respect of manufactured goods that would provide traceability of the process. This process was formalised by the British Government and in 1979 as the quality control standard [[BS 5750|BS&amp;nbsp;5750]]. In 1987 BS&amp;nbsp;5750 was adopted by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] as the basis for [[ISO 9000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher = [[British Standards Institution]] (BSI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISO 9000 is a general purpose quality control standard which works in conjunction industry-specific standards: for example ISO 15195:2003 which gives the specific requirements for reference measurement laboratories in laboratory medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

International trade is hampered by one country not recognising the quality controls in place in other countries – often due to standards being different or being incompatible with each other. At the 20th CGPM (1995), it was recognised that although ad-hoc recognition of instrument calibration between cooperating countries had been taking place for a hundred years, a need had arisen for a more comprehensive agreement. Consequently, the CIPM was mandated to investigate the setting up of a [[Mutual Recognition Agreement]] in respect of instrument calibration. Any such agreement would require the keeping of records that could demonstrate the traceability of calibrations back to the base standards. Such records would be recorded within an ISO&amp;nbsp;9000 framework. Four years later, in 1999 the text of the CIPM-MRA was agreed at the 21st CGPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The CIPM-MRA scheme is to catalogue the capabilities of National Measurement Institutes (NMIs) such as [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] in the United States or the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] in the United Kingdom whose calibration procedures have been peer-assessed.

*The agreement is only open to countries that have signed the Metre Convention, either as full or as associate members.
*A country may have more than one NMI, though only one NMI is chosen as the signatory organisation.
*The measurement capabilituies of NMI's will be peer-reviewed at regular intervals and each NMI will recognise the measurement capabilities of other NMIs.
*The BIPM maintains a publicly available database of the measurement capabilities of each NMI.

===Coordination of International Atomic Time===
With the advent of the [[atomic clock]] it has been possible to define and measure [[International Atomic Time]] with sufficient precision that variations in the [[Earth's rotation]] can be detected. The [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service|International Earth Rotation Service]] monitors these changes relative to the stars at regular intervals and proposes leap seconds as and when these are needed. Currently there are over 200 atomic clocks in over 50 national laboratories around the world and the BIPM, in terms of the mandate given to it under the Metre Convention, coordinates the various atomic clocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Relations between New SI units definitions.svg|thumb|250 px | Relations between proposed SI units definitions (in color) and with seven fundamental constants of nature (in grey) with fixed numerical values in the proposed system.]]
Since 1960, when the definition of the metre was linked to a particular wavelength of light rather than the international prototype metre, the only unit of measure that has been dependent on a particular artefact has been the kilogram. Over the years, small drifts which could be as high as {{gaps|20|×|10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;}} kilograms per annum in the mass of the international prototype kilogram have been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Independently of this drift having been identified, the [[Avogadro constant#International Avogadro Coordination|Avogadro project]] and development of the [[Kibble balance|Kibble (or watt) balance]] promised methods of indirectly measuring mass with a very high precision. These projects provided tools that would enable alternative means of redefining the kilogram.&lt;ref name=Crease&gt;{{cite journal

A report published in 2007 by the Consultative Committee for Thermometry to the CIPM noted that their current definition of temperature has proved to be unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20&amp;nbsp;K and for temperatures above 1300&amp;nbsp;K. The committee was of the view that the [[Boltzmann constant]] provided a better basis for temperature measurement than did the [[triple point]] of water, as it overcame these difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Jamaica]], although also a member of CARICOM, is an associate of the CGPM in its own right.&lt;/ref&gt; that only wish to participate in the [[Mutual recognition agreement|MRA]] programme.

On 20 May 1875 representatives from seventeen of countries that attended the Conference of the Metre in 1875, signed the Convention of the Metre.&lt;ref group = Note&gt;[[Argentina]], [[Austria-Hungary]], Belgium, [[Empire of Brazil|Brazil]], [[Denmark]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Peru]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Spain under the Restoration|Spain]], [[Sweden and Norway]], Switzerland, [[Ottoman Empire]], United States and [[Venezuela]].&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1884 HJ Chaney, Warden of Standards in London unofficially contacted the BIPM inquiring whether the BIPM would calibrate some metre standards that had been manufactured in the United Kingdom. [[Ole Jacob Broch|Broch]], director of the BIPM replied that he was not authorised to perform any such calibrations for non-member states. On 17 September 1884, the British Government signed the convention on behalf of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Nationalism''' is a political, social, and economic ideology and movement characterized by the promotion of the interests of a particular [[nation]],&lt;ref name="Smith1"&gt;[[Anthony D. Smith|Smith, Anthony]]. ''Nationalism: Theory, Ideology, History''. [[Polity (publisher)|Polity]], 2010. pp.9, 25-30&lt;/ref&gt; especially with the aim of gaining and maintaining the nation's [[sovereignty]] ([[self-governance]]) over its [[homeland]]. Nationalism holds that each nation should govern itself, free from outside interference ([[self-determination]]), that a nation is a natural and ideal basis for a [[polity]],&lt;ref name="Finlayson"&gt;Finlayson, Alan. "Chapter 5: Nationalism", in ''Political Ideologies: An Introduction''. Edited by Vincent Geoghegan. Routledge, 2014. pp.100-102&lt;/ref&gt; and that the nation is the only rightful source of political power ([[popular sovereignty]]).&lt;ref name="Smith1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yack, Bernard. ''Nationalism and the Moral Psychology of Community''. University of Chicago Press, 2012. p.142&lt;/ref&gt; It further aims to build and maintain a single [[national identity]]—based on shared social characteristics such as [[culture]], [[language]], [[religion]], politics, and belief in a shared singular history&lt;ref name = Triandafyllidou&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Triandafyllidou | first1 = Anna | year = 1998 | title = National Identity and the Other | journal = Ethnic and Racial Studies | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 593–612. | doi=10.1080/014198798329784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Smith&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Smith | first1 = A.D. | year = 1981 | title = The Ethnic Revival in the Modern World | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2018}}—and to promote national unity or [[solidarity]].&lt;ref name="Smith1"/&gt; Nationalism, therefore, seeks to preserve and foster a nation's traditional culture, and cultural revivals have been associated with nationalist movements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony D. Smith|Smith, Anthony]]. ''Nationalism: Theory, Ideology, History''. [[Polity (publisher)|Polity]], 2010. pp.6-7, 30-31, 37&lt;/ref&gt; It also encourages pride in national achievements, and is closely linked to [[patriotism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= Nairn | first1= Tom | last2= James | first2= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Global Matrix: Nationalism, Globalism and State-Terrorism | url= https://www.academia.edu/1642325/Global_Matrix_Nationalism_Globalism_and_Terrorism_author_with_Tom_Nairn_Pluto_Press_London_2005 | year= 2005 | publisher= Pluto Press | location= London and New York}}; and {{Cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In – Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006 | year= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2018}}  Nationalism is often combined with other ideologies, such as [[conservatism]] ([[national conservatism]]) or [[socialism]] ([[socialist nationalism]]) for example.&lt;ref name="Finlayson"/&gt;

Nationalism as an ideology is modern. Throughout history, people have had an attachment to their [[Kinship|kin group]] and traditions, to territorial authorities and to their homeland, but nationalism did not become a widely-recognized concept until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kohn|first1=Hans|title=Nationalism|date=2018|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/nationalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three [[paradigms]] for understanding the origins and basis of nationalism. [[Primordialism]] (perennialism) proposes that there have always been nations and that nationalism is a natural phenomenon. [[Ethnosymbolism]] explains nationalism as a dynamic, evolutionary phenomenon and stresses the importance of symbols, myths and traditions in the development of nations and nationalism. [[Modernism]] proposes that nationalism is a recent social phenomenon that needs the socio-economic structures of modern society to exist.&lt;ref name="Anthony Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Anthony|year=2012|title=Nationalism|edition=2nd|publisher=polity|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-7456-5128-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various definitions of a "nation", however, which leads to different [[Types of nationalism|strands of nationalism]]. It can be a belief that [[citizenship]] in a state should be limited to one [[Ethnic group|ethnic]], cultural, religious or identity group; or that [[Multinational state|multinationality]] in a state should mean the right to express and exercise national identity even by minorities.{{sfn|Kymlicka|1995|p=16}}{{Failed verification|date=November 2018}}
The adoption of national identity in terms of historical development has often been a response by influential groups unsatisfied with traditional identities due to mismatch between their defined social order and the experience of that social order by its members, resulting in an [[anomie]] that nationalists seek to resolve.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=262}} This anomie results in a society reinterpreting identity, retaining elements deemed acceptable and removing elements deemed unacceptable, to create a unified community.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=262}} This development may be the result of internal structural issues or the result of resentment by an existing group or groups towards other communities, especially foreign powers that are (or are deemed to be) controlling them.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=262}}
[[National symbol]]s and [[National flag|flags]], [[national anthem]]s, [[national language]]s, [[national myth]]s and other symbols of national identity are highly important in nationalism.{{sfn|Billig|1995|p=72}}&lt;ref name="Gellner 2005"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gellner|first=Ernest|authorlink=Ernest Gellner|title=Nations and Nationalism |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |edition=2nd |isbn=1-4051-3442-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jl7t2yMfxwIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canovan 1996"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Canovan|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Canovan|title=Nationhood and Political Theory|publisher=Edward Elgar| location=Cheltenham, UK| year=1996 |isbn=1-85278-852-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;lord {{harvnb|Miller|1995|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, nationalism can be seen as positive or negative depending on context and individual outlook. Nationalism has been an important driver in independence movements, such as the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Revolution]], the [[Irish War of Independence|Irish Revolution]], and the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement that created modern [[Israel]]. It also was a key factor in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] perpetrated by [[Nazi Germany]]. More recently, nationalism was an important driver of the controversial [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea by Russia]]. Nationalist economic policies have also been cited as causes for the [[Opium Wars]] between the [[British Empire]] and the [[Qing dynasty]], and for the severity of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== Terminology ==

The word ''nation'' was used before 1800 in Europe to refer to the inhabitants of a country as well as to collective identities that could include shared history, law, language, political rights, religion and traditions, in a sense more akin to the modern conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gat |first=Azar |date=2012 |title=Nations: The Long History and Deep Roots of Political Ethnicity and Nationalism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=214|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HK8TulTJpGAC|isbn=9781107007857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nationalism'' is a newer word; in English the term dates from 1844, although the concept is older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nationalism |title=Nationalism|website=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became important in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;See Norman Rich, ''The age of nationalism and reform, 1850–1890'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; The term increasingly became negative in its connotations after 1914.  Glenda Sluga notes that "The twentieth century, a time of profound disillusionment with nationalism, was also the great age of [[globalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;Glenda Sluga, ''Internationalism in the Age of Nationalism'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2013) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nationalism'' has been a recurring facet of civilizations since ancient times, though the modern sense of national political autonomy and self-determination was formalized in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Kohn, ''The idea of nationalism: A study in its origins and background'' (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of nationalist movements can be found throughout history, from the [[Jewish–Roman wars|Jewish revolts]] of the 1st and 2nd centuries, to the re-emergence of Persian culture during the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanid period]] of [[Persia]], to the re-emergence of Latin culture in the [[Western Roman Empire]] during the 4th and 5th centuries, as well as many others. In modern times, examples can be seen in the emergence of [[German nationalism]] as a reaction against [[Napoleon]]ic control of Germany as the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] around 1805–14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregorio F.

Typically historians of nationalism in Europe begin with the [[French Revolution]] (1789), not only for its impact on [[French nationalism]] but even more for its impact on [[Germans]] and Italians and on European intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Pearson, ed., ''The Long-man companion to European nationalism 1789–1920'' (2014) p. xi, with details on each country large and small.&lt;/ref&gt; The template of nationalism, as a method for mobilising public opinion around a new state based on popular sovereignty, went back further than 1789: philosophers such as [[Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]], whose ideas influenced the French Revolution, had themselves been influenced or encouraged by the example of earlier constitutionalist liberation movements, notably the [[Corsican Republic]] (1755–68) and [[American Revolution]] (1765-83).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uncpress.org/book/9780807872000/nationalism-in-europe-and-america/|title=Nationalism in Europe and America {{!}} Lloyd S.

Due to the [[Industrial Revolution]], there was an emergence of an integrated, nation-encompassing economy and a national [[public sphere]], where the British people began to identify with the country at large, rather than the smaller units of their province, town or family. The early emergence of a popular patriotic nationalism took place in the mid-18th century, and was actively promoted by the British government and by the writers and intellectuals of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Rise of English Nationalism: A Cultural History, 1740–1830|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UiTYQ_9ZhakC|author= Gerald Newman|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|year= 1997|isbn= 9780312176990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National symbol]]s, anthems, [[national myth|myths]], flags and narratives were assiduously constructed by nationalists and widely adopted.

{{main|International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)}}
The political development of nationalism and the push for [[popular sovereignty]] culminated with the ethnic/national revolutions of Europe. During the 19th century nationalism became one of the most significant political and social forces in history; it is typically listed among the top causes of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Horne|title=A Companion to World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjZHLXRKjtEC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=21–22|isbn=9781119968702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gillette | first1 = Aaron | year = 2006 | title = Why Did They Fight the Great War?

Napoleon's conquests of the German and Italian states around 1800–06 played a major role in stimulating nationalism and the demands for national unity.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Kohn, "Napoleon and the Age of Nationalism."

Nationalism in France gained early expressions in France's revolutionary government. In 1793, that government declared a mass conscription (''levée en masse'') with a call to service:&lt;blockquote&gt;Henceforth, until the enemies have been driven from the territory of the Republic, all the French are in permanent requisition for army service. The young men shall go to battle; the married men shall forge arms in the hospitals; the children shall turn old linen to lint; the old men shall repair to the public places, to stimulate the courage of the warriors and preach the unity of the Republic and the hatred of kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People in Arms: Military Myth and National Mobilization since the French Revolution|last=|first=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=|editor-last=Moran|editor-first=Daniel|location=Cambridge|pages=14|editor-last2=Waldron|editor-first2=Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This nationalism gained pace after the French Revolution came to a close. Defeat in war, with a loss in territory, was a powerful force in nationalism. In France, revenge and return of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] was a powerful motivating force for a quarter century after their defeat by Germany in 1871.  However, after 1895 French nationalists focused on Dreyfus and internal subversion, and the Alsace issue petered out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K. Varley|title=Under the Shadow of Defeat: The War of 1870-71 in French Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wJGFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-0-230-58234-7|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French reaction was a famous case of [[Revanchism|''Revanchism'' ("revenge")]] which demands the return of lost territory that "belongs" to the national homeland.  Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and it is often motivated by economic or geo-political factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains "unredeemed" outside the borders of its appropriate nation state. Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims. Revanchist justifications are often presented as based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since "time immemorial", an assertion that is usually inextricably involved in revanchism and irredentism, justifying them in the eyes of their proponents.&lt;ref&gt;Karine Varley, "The Taboos of Defeat: Unmentionable Memories of the Franco-Prussian War in France, 1870–1914." in Jenny Macleod, ed., ''Defeat and Memory: Cultural Histories of Military Defeat in the Modern Era'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008) pp. 62-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dreyfus Affair]] in France 1894-1906 made the battle against treason and disloyalty a central theme for conservative Catholic French nationalists. Dreyfus, a Jew, was an outsider, that is in the views of intense nationalists, not a true Frenchman, not one to be trusted, not one to be given the benefit of the doubt. True loyalty to the nation, from the conservative viewpoint, was threatened by liberal and republican principles of liberty and equality that were leading the country to disaster.&lt;ref name="google_2016_pg173"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy D.

====Germany====
{{main|German nationalism}}
[[File:Barricade bei der Universität am 26ten Mai 1848 in Wien.jpg|thumb|Revolutionaries in [[Vienna]] with [[Flag of Germany|German tricolor flags]], May 1848]]
In the German states west of Prussia, [[Napoleon]] abolished many of the old or medieval relics, such as dissolving the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Forrest and Peter H. Wilson, eds. ''The Bee and the Eagle: Napoleonic France and the End of the Holy Roman Empire'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; He imposed rational legal systems and demonstrated how dramatic changes were possible. His organization of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] in 1806 promoted a feeling of nationalism.

Nationalists sought to encompass masculinity in their quest for strength and unity.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Hagemann,  "Of  'manly valor' and 'German Honor': nation, war, and masculinity in the age of the Prussian uprising against Napoleon." ''Central European History'' 30#2 (1997): 187–220.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Prussian chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] who achieved German unification through a series of highly successful short wars against Denmark, Austria and France which thrilled the pan-German nationalists in the smaller German states. They fought in his wars and eagerly joined the new German Empire, which Bismarck ran as a force for balance and peace in Europe after 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen Schulze, ''The Course of German Nationalism: From Frederick the Great to Bismarck 1763–1867'' (Cambridge UP, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century German nationalism was promoted by Hegelian-oriented academic historians who saw Prussia as the true carrier of the German spirit, and the power of the state as the ultimate goal of nationalism. The three main historians were [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] (1808–1884), [[Heinrich von Sybel]] (1817–1895) and [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] (1834–1896).  Droysen moved from liberalism to an intense nationalism that celebrated Prussian Protestantism, efficiency, progress, and reform, in striking contrast to Austrian Catholicism, impotency and backwardness. He idealized the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia.  His large-scale ''History of Prussian Politics'' (14 vol 1855–1886) was foundational for nationalistic students and scholars. Von Sybel founded and edited the leading academic history journal, ''[[Historische Zeitschrift]]'' and as the director of the Prussian state archives published massive compilations that were devoured by scholars of nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Louis L. Snyder, ''Encyclopedia of Nationalism'' (1990) pp. 77–78, 381–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential of the German nationalist historians, was Treitschke who had an enormous influence on elite students at Heidelberg and Berlin universities.&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hausrath, ed. ''Treitschke, his doctrine of German destiny and of international relations: together with a study of his life and work'' (1914) [https://books.google.com/books?id=z-yAAAAAMAAJ online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Treitschke vehemently attacked parliamentarianism, socialism, pacifism, the English, the French, the Jews, and the internationalists. The core of his message was the need for a strong, unified state—a unified Germany under Prussian supervision. "It is the highest duty of the State to increase its power," he stated. Although he was a descendant of a Czech family he considered himself not Slavic but German: "I am 1000 times more the patriot than a professor."&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, ''Encyclopedia of Nationalism'' (1990) pp. 399–401&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazism, however, may also be understood as trans-national in nature.  The National Socialist German Workers' Party or Na-Si, pronounced as Nazi in English, were devoted to what they identified as an [[Aryan race]], residing in [[Austria]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], and parts of [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Latvia]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hochman|first=Adam|date=2015|title=Of Vikings and Nazis: Norwegian contributions to the rise and the fall of the idea of a superior Aryan race.|url=https://philarchive.org/archive/HOCOVA|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|volume=54|pages=84-88|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See [[Nazi propaganda and the United Kingdom]].

Meanwhile, the Nazis rejected many of the well-established citizens within those same countries, such as gypsies (Roma) and of course Jews, whom they did not identify as Aryan.  Meanwhile, a key Nazi doctrine was "Living Space" (for Aryans only) or "[[Lebensraum]]," which was a vast undertaking to transplant Aryans throughout [[Poland]], much of [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Baltic nations]], and all of Western [[Russia]] and the [[Ukraine]].  Lebensraum was thus a vast project for advancing the Aryan race far outside of any particular nation or national borders.  The Nazi's goals were racist focused on advancing the Aryan race as they perceived it, [[eugenics]] modification of the human race, and the eradication of human beings that they deemed inferior.  But their goals were trans-national and intended to spread across as much of the world as they could achieve.  Although Nazism glorified German history, it also embraced the supposed virtues and achievements of the Aryan race in other countries &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aryan|title=Aryan people|author=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica|date=n.d.|website=Encyclopedia Britannica On-line|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including India. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKay|first=Alex|date=Spring 2001|title=Hitler and the Himalayas: The SS Mission to Tibet 1938-39|url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/hitler-and-himalayas-ss-mission-tibet-1938-39/|journal=[[Tricycle Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nazis' Aryanism longed for now-extinct species of superior bulls once used as livestock by Aryans and other features of Aryan history that never resided within the borders of Germany as a nation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/when-nazis-tried-bring-animals-back-extinction-180962739/|title=When the Nazis Tried to Bring Animals Back From Extinction: Their ideology of genetic purity extended to aspirations about reviving a pristine landscape with ancient animals and forests|last=Boissoneault|first=Lorraine|date=March 31, 2017|website=[[Smithsonian.com]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
{{main|Italian nationalism|Italian unification}}
[[File:Napoli Castel Nuovo museo civico - ingresso di Garibaldi a Napoli - Wenzel bis.jpg|thumb|People cheering as [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] enters Naples in 1860]]
Italian nationalism emerged in the 19th century and was the driving force for [[Italian unification]] or the "Risorgimento" (meaning the Resurgence or revival). It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated different states of the Italian peninsula into the single state of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. The memory of the Risorgimento is central to Italian nationalism but it was based in the liberal middle classes and proved weak.&lt;ref&gt;Silvana Patriarca and Lucy Riall, eds., ''The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth-century Italy'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;   Two major groups remained opposed, the South (called the [[Mezzogiorno]]) and the devout Catholics. The new government treated the South as a conquered province with ridicule for its "backward" and poverty stricken society, its poor grasp of the Italian language, and its traditions. The liberals had always been strong opponents of the pope and the very well organized Catholic Church.  The pope had been in political control of central Italy; he lost that in 1860 and lost Rome in 1870.  He had long been the leader of opposition to modern liberalism and refused to accept the terms offered by the new government.  He called himself a prisoner in the Vatican and forbade Catholics to vote or engage in politics.  The Catholic alienation lasted until 1929.  The liberal government under [[Francesco Crispi]] sought to enlarge his political base by emulating Bismarck and firing up Italian nationalism with a hyper-aggressive foreign policy. It crashed and his cause was set back.  Historian R.J.B. Bosworth says of his nationalistic foreign policy that Crispi:
:pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime. Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed his German or British friends with this suggestions of preventative attacks on his enemies.  His policies were ruinous, both for Italy's trade with France, and, more humiliatingly, for colonial ambitions in East Africa. Crispi's lust for territory there was thwarted when on 1 March 1896, the armies of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik routed Italian forces at [[Battle of Adwa|Adowa]] ... in what has been defined as an unparalleled disaster for a modern army. Crispi, whose private life (he was perhaps a trigamist) and personal finances...were objects of perennial scandal, went into dishonorable retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=R.J.B. Bosworth|title=Italy and the Wider World: 1860–1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VL1vjYQRR-0C&amp;pg=PA29|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=29|isbn=9781134780884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, a third major group emerged that was hostile to nationalism as radical socialist elements became a force in the industrial North, and they too rejected liberalism. Italy joined the Allies in the First World War after getting promises of territory, but its war effort was a fiasco that discredited liberalism and paved the way for [[Benito Mussolini]] and his fascism. That involved a highly aggressive nationalism that led to a series of wars, an alliance with Hitler's Germany, and humiliation and hardship in the Second World War. After 1945 the Catholics returned to government and tensions eased somewhat, but the Mezzogiorno remained poor and ridiculed. The working class now voted for the Communist Party, and it looked to Moscow not Rome for inspiration, and was kept out of the national government even as it controlled industrial cities across the North. In the 21st century the Communists are gone but political and cultural tensions remained high as shown by separatist [[Padanian nationalism]] in the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Barbour and Cathie Carmichael, eds.|title=Language and Nationalism in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ixmu8Iga7gC&amp;pg=PA181|year=2000|publisher=Oxford UP chapter 8|isbn=9780191584077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries the [[Orthodox Christian]] [[Serbs]] were ruled by the Muslim [[Ottoman Empire]]. The success of the [[Serbian Revolution]] against [[History of Ottoman Serbia|Ottoman rule]] in 1817 marked the birth of the [[Principality of Serbia]]. It achieved ''de facto'' independence in 1867 and finally gained [[Berlin Congress|international recognition]] in 1878. Serbia had sought to liberate and unite with Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west and [[Old Serbia]] ([[Kosovo]] and [[Vardar Macedonia]]) to the south. Nationalist circles in both [[Serbia]] and Croatia (in the [[Habsburg Empire]]) began to advocate for a greater [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] union in the 1860s, claiming [[Bosnia]] as their common land based on shared language and tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hajdarpasic|first1=Edin|title=Whose Bosnia?

In 1918, the region of [[Banat, Bačka and Baranja]] proclaimed its secession from Austria-Hungary to unite with Serbia; the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] joined the union with [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] on 1 December 1918, and the country was named [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]. It was renamed [[Yugoslavia]], and a [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav identity]] was promoted, which ultimately failed. After the Second World War, [[Yugoslav Communists]] established a new [[SFR Yugoslavia|socialist republic of Yugoslavia]]. That state [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|broke up]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Sabrina P. Ramet, ''Nationalism and federalism in Yugoslavia, 1962–1991'' (Indiana Univ Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poland====
{{main|History of Poland|Polish nationalism}}
The cause of Polish nationalism was repeatedly frustrated before 1918.  In the 1790s, [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]], [[Prussia]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] 
invaded, annexed, and subsequently [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]]. Napoleon set up the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a new Polish state that ignited a spirit of nationalism. Russia took it over in 1815 as [[Congress Poland]] with the tsar proclaimed as "King of Poland". Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted [[November Uprising|in 1830]] and [[January Uprising|1863–64]] but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to Russify the [[Polish language]], [[Culture of Poland|culture]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|religion]]. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to re-establish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939.  Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the [[Kulturkampf]] of the 1870s.  The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and defeated Bismarck politically. He responded by stopping the harassment and cooperating with the Centre Party.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Blanke, ''Prussian Poland in the German Empire (1871–1900)'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''God's Playground: A History of Poland, Vol. 2: 1795 to the Present'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th century, many Polish nationalist leaders endorsed the [[Piast Concept]]. It held there was a Polish utopia during the Piast Dynasty a thousand years before, and modern Polish nationalists should restore its central values of Poland for the Poles. Jan Poplawski had developed the "Piast Concept" in the 1890s, and it formed the centerpiece of Polish nationalist ideology, especially as presented by the [[National-Democratic Party (Poland)|National Democracy Party]], known as the "Endecja," which was led by [[Roman Dmowski]]. In contrast with the Jagiellon concept, there was no concept for a multi-ethnic Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey A. Hosking and George Schöpflin|title=Myths and Nationhood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UoOpBJk52GcC&amp;pg=PA152|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|page=152|isbn=9780415919746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bolivar Arturo Michelena.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|General Simón Bolívar, (1783–1830), a leader of independence in Latin America.]]

The Piast concept stood in opposition to the "Jagiellon Concept," which allowed for multi-ethnicism and Polish rule over numerous minority groups such as those in the [[Kresy]]. The Jagiellon Concept was the official policy of the government in the 1920s and 1930s. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] dictator [[Josef Stalin]] at Tehran in 1943 rejected the Jagiellon Concept because it involved Polish rule over [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]]. He instead endorsed the Piast Concept, which justified a massive shift of Poland's frontiers to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharp | first1 = Tony | year = 1977 | title = The Origins of the 'Teheran Formula' on Polish Frontiers | journal = Journal of Contemporary History | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 381–93 | jstor=260222 | doi=10.1177/002200947701200209}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1945 the Soviet-back puppet communist regime wholeheartedly adopted the Piast Concept, making it the centerpiece of their claim to be the "true inheritors of Polish nationalism". After all the killings, including Nazi German occupation, terror in Poland and population transfers during and after the war, the nation was officially declared as 99% ethnically Polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Davies|title=Heart of Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lMQei5CPZUgC&amp;pg=PA286|pages=286–87|isbn=9780191587719|date=2001-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jewish Nationalism====

Jewish nationalism arose in the latter half of the 19th century and it was largely correlated with the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]]. This term originated from the word ''[[Zion]]'', which was one of the [[Torah]]'s names for the city of [[Jerusalem]]. The end goal of the nationalists and Zionists was to establish a sovereign Jewish state in the [[Land of Israel|land of Palestine]]. A tumultuous history of living in oppressive, foreign, and uncertain circumstances led the supporters of the movement to draft a declaration of independence, claiming Israel as a birthplace. The first and second destructions of the temple and ancient Torah prophecies largely shaped the incentives of the Jewish nationalists. Many prominent theories in Jewish theology and eschatology were formed by supporters and opponents of the movement in this era.

It was the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, which sparked new waves of thinking across Europe regarding governance and sovereignty. A shift from the traditional hierarchy-based system towards political individualism and citizen-states posed a dilemma for the Jews. Citizenship was now essential, when it came to ensuring basic legal and residential rights. This resulted in more and more Jews choosing to identify with certain nationalities in order to maintain these rights. Logic said that a nation-based system of states  would require the Jews themselves to claim their own right to be considered a nation due to a distinguishable language and history. Historian David Engel has explained that Zionism was more about fear that a majority of worldwide Jews would end up dispersed and unprotected, rather than fulfilling old prophecies and traditions of historical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zionism|last=David|first=Engel|publisher=Pearson Longman Publishing Group|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Latin America====
{{main|Latin American Wars of Independence}}
An upsurge in nationalism in Latin America in 1810s and 1820s sparked revolutions that cost Spain nearly all its colonies there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Nicola | year = 2006 | title = The historiography of nationalism and national identity in Latin America | url = | journal = Nations and Nationalism | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 201–21 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8129.2006.00237.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain was at war with Britain from 1798 to 1808, and the British Royal Navy cut off its contacts with its colonies so nationalism flourished and trade with Spain was suspended. The colonies set up temporary governments or juntas which were effectively independent from Spain. The division exploded between Spaniards who were born in Spain (called "peninsulares") versus those of Spanish descent born in [[New Spain]] (called "criollos" in Spanish or "creoles" in English). The two groups wrestled for power, with the criollos leading the call for independence. Spain tried to use its armies to fight back but had no help from European powers. Indeed, Britain{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} and the United States worked against Spain, enforcing the [[Monroe Doctrine]].  Spain lost all of its American colonies, except Cuba and Puerto Rico, in a [[Spanish American wars of independence|complex series of revolts]] from 1808 to 1826.&lt;ref&gt;John Lynch, ''The Spanish American Revolutions 1808–1826'' (2nd ed. 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===

====China====
{{main|Chinese nationalism}}
The awakening of nationalism across Asia helped shape the history of the continent.  The key episode was the [[Russo-Japanese War|decisive defeat of Russia]] by Japan in 1905, demonstrating the military superiority of non-Europeans in a modern war. The defeat which quickly led to manifestations of a new interest in nationalism in China, as well as Turkey, and Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Rotem Kowner, ed., ''The impact of the Russo-Japanese war'' (Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In China [[Sun Yat-sen]] (1866–1925) launched his new party the [[Kuomintang]] (National People's Party) in defiance of the decrepit Empire, which was run by outsiders. Kuomintang recruits pledged:
:from this moment I will destroy the old and build the new, and fight for the self-determination of the people, and will apply all my strength to the support of the Chinese Republic and the realization of democracy through the Three Principles, . . . for the progress of good government, the happiness and perpetual peace of the people, and for the strengthening of the foundations of the state in the name of peace throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Kohn, ''Nationalism: Its Meaning and History'' (1955) p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Kuomintang largely ran China until the Communists took over in 1949. but the latter had also been strongly influence by Sun's nationalism as well as by the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919. It was a nationwide protest movement about the domestic backwardness of China and has often been depicted as the intellectual foundation for Chinese Communism.&lt;ref&gt;Shakhar Rahav, ''The Rise of Political Intellectuals in Modern China: May Fourth Societies and the Roots of Mass-Party Politics'' (Oxford UP, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Culture Movement]] stimulated by the May Fourth Movement waxed strong throughout the 1920s and 1930s. According to historian Patricia Ebrey:
:Nationalism, patriotism, progress, science, democracy, and freedom were the goals; imperialism, feudalism, warlordism, autocracy, patriarchy, and blind adherence to tradition were the enemies. Intellectuals struggled with how to be strong and modern and yet Chinese, how to preserve China as a political entity in the world of competing nations.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'' (1996) p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

====Africa====
{{main|African nationalism|History of Africa}}
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-124-8.jpg|thumb|[[Kenneth Kaunda]], an anti-colonial political leader from [[Zambia]], pictured at a nationalist rally in colonial [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]) in 1960]]

In the 1880s the European powers divided up almost all of Africa (only Ethiopia and Liberia were independent). They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger.  In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,&lt;ref&gt;Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954–1962'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya&lt;ref&gt;David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere. 
Across Africa nationalism drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers not the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them.  Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Almond and James S. Coleman, ''The Politics of the Developing Areas'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam, ''Nationalism in colonial and post-colonial Africa'' (University Press of America, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hodgkin, ''Nationalism in Colonial Africa'' (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of South Africa|South Africa]], a British colony, was exceptional in that it became virtually independent by 1931. From 1948 to 1994, it was controlled by white [[Afrikaner]] nationalists focused on racial segregation and white minority rule known officially as [[apartheid]]. The black nationalist movement fought them until success was achieved by the [[African National Congress]] in 1994 and [[Nelson Mandela]] was elected President.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy L. Clark and William H. Worger, ''South Africa: The rise and fall of apartheid'' (Routledge, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Middle East ====
[[Arab nationalism]], a movement toward liberating and empowering the Arab peoples of the Middle East, emerged during the latter 19th century, inspired by other independence movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the [[Ottoman Empire]] declined and the Middle East was carved up by the Great Powers of Europe, Arabs sought to establish their own independent nations ruled by Arabs rather than foreigners. [[Syria]] was established in 1920; Transjordan (later [[Jordan]]) gradually gained independence between 1921 and 1946; [[Saudi Arabia]] was established in 1932; and [[Egypt]] achieved gradually gained independence between 1922 and 1952. The [[Arab League]] was established in 1945 to promote Arab interests and cooperation between the new Arab states.

Parallel to these efforts was the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] which emerged among European Jews in the 19th century. Beginning in 1882 Jews, predominantly from Europe, began emigrating to [[Ottoman Palestine]] with the goal of establishing a new Jewish homeland. The effort culminated in the declaration of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. As this move conflicted with the belief among Arab nationalists that Palestine was part of the Arab nation, the neighboring Arab nations [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|launched an invasion]] to claim the region. The invasion was only partly successful and led to decades of clashes between the Arab and Jewish nationalist ideologies.

==== Post-Communism ====
There was a rise in extreme nationalism after the [[Revolutions of 1989]] triggered the collapse of communism in the 1990s. When communism fell, it left many people with no identity. The people under communist rule had to integrate, and they found themselves free to choose. Given free choice, long dormant conflicts rose up and created sources of serious conflict.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=1993|title=Nationalism Redux: Through the Glass of the Post-Communist States Darkly.|url=|journal=Ethnic Conflicts WorldWide, Current History|volume=|pages=162–166|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.

In his 1992 article ''Jihad vs. McWorld,'' [[Benjamin Barber]] proposed that the fall of communism will cause large numbers of people to search for unity and that small scale wars will become common; groups will attempt to redraw boundaries, identities, cultures and ideologies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Benjamin|date=1992|title=Jihad vs. McWorld: the two axial principles of our age—tribalism and globalism—clash at every point except one: they may both be threatening to democracy|url=|journal=The Atlantic|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communism's fall also allowed for an  "us vs. them" mentality to sprout up.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|date=1993|title=The Clash of Civilizations|url=|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=|pages=22–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments become vehicles for social interests and the country will attempt to form national policies based on the majority, for example culture, religion or ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some newly sprouted democracies have large differences in policies on matters that ranged from immigration and human rights to trade and commerce.

Academic Steven Berg felt that at the root of nationalist conflicts is the demand for autonomy and a separate existence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This nationalism can give rise to strong emotions that may lead to a group fighting to survive, especially as after the fall of communism, political boundaries did not match ethnic boundaries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Serious conflicts often arose and escalated very easily as individuals and groups acted upon their beliefs, causing death and destruction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When this would happen, those states who were unable to contain the conflict ran the risk of slowing their democratization progress.

Yugoslavia was established after WWI and was a merger of three separate ethnic groups; Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.  The national census numbers for a ten-year span 1971–1981 measured an increase from 1.3 to 5.4% in their population that ethnically identified as Yugoslav.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=2004|title=Why Yugoslavia Fell Apart|url=|journal=Current History|volume=92:577|pages=357–363|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the country, almost as a whole, was divided by distinctive religious, ethnic or national loyalties after nearly 50 years.

Within Yugoslavia, separating Croatia and Slovenia from the rest of Yugoslavia is an invisible line of previous conquests of the region. Croatia and Slovenia to the northwest were conquered by Catholics or Protestants, and benefited from European history; the Renaissance, French Revolution, Industrial Revolution and are more inclined towards democracy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The remaining Yugoslavian territory was conquered by the Ottoman or Tsarists empires; are Orthodox or Muslims, are less economically advanced and are less inclined toward democracy.

In the 1970s the leadership of the separate territories within Yugoslavia protected only territorial interests at the expense of other territories. In Croatia, there was almost a split within the territory between Serbs and Croats so any political decision would kindle unrest, and tensions could cross the territories adjacent; Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Within Bosnia there was no group who had a majority; Muslim, Serb, Croat, and Yugoslav were all there so the leadership could not advance here either.  Political organizations were not able to deal successfully with such diverse nationalism. Within the territories the leadership could not compromise. To do so would create a winner in one ethnic group and a loser in another, raising the possibility of a serious conflict.  This strengthened the political stance promoting ethnic identities. This caused intense and divided political leadership within Yugoslavia.

In the 1980s Yugoslavia began to break into fragments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The economic conditions within Yugoslavia were deteriorating. Conflict in the disputed territories was stimulated by the rise in mass nationalism and inter-ethnic hostilities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The per-capita income of people in the northwest territory, encompassing Croatia and Slovenia, in contrast to the southern territory were several times higher. This combined with escalating violence from ethnic Albanians and Serbs within Kosovo intensified economic conditions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This violence greatly contributed to the rise of extreme nationalism of Serbs in Serbia and within Yugoslavia. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo was propagandized by Communist Serbian Slobodan Milosevic to further increase Serb nationalism. As mentioned, this nationalism did give rise to powerful emotions which grew the force of Serbian nationalism through highly nationalist demonstrations in Vojvodina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Serbian nationalism was so high, Slobodan Milosevic was able to oust leaders in Vojvodina and Montenegro, further repressed Albanians within Kosovo and eventually controlled four of the eight regions/territories.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Slovenia, one of the four regions not under Communist control, favoring a democratic state.

Within Slovenia, fear was mounting because Milosevic was using the militia to suppress a in Kosovo, what would he do to Slovenia.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Half of Yugoslavia wanted to be democratic, the other wanted a new nationalist authoritarian regime. In fall of 1989 tensions came to a head and Slovenia asserted its political and economic independence from Yugoslavia and seceded. In January 1990, there was a total break with Serbia at the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, an institution conceived by Milosevic to strengthen unity and became the backdrop for the fall of communism within Yugoslavia.

In August 1990, a warning to the region was issued when ethnically divided groups attempted to alter the government structure. The republic borders established by the Communist regime in the postwar period were extremely vulnerable to challenges from ethnic communities.Ethnic communities arose because they did not share the identity with everyone within the new post-Communist borders.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This threatened the new governments. The same disputes were erupting that were in place prior to Milosevic and were compounded by actions from his regime.

Also within the territory the Croats and the Serbs were in direct competition for control of government. Elections were held and increased potential conflicts between Serb and Croat nationalism. Serbia wanted to be separate and decide its own future based on its own ethnic composition. But this would then give Kosovo encouragement to become independent from Serbia. Albanians in Kosovo were already independent from Kosovo. Serbia didn't want to let Kosovo become independent. Muslims nationalists wanted their own territory but it would require a redrawing of the map, and would threaten neighboring territories. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.

Nationalism again gave rise to powerful emotions which evoked in some extreme cases, a willingness to die for what you believe in, a fight for the survival of the group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The end of communism began a long period of conflict and war for the region. In the six years following the collapse 200,000-500-000 people died in the Bosnian war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina|date=1996|title=Eastern Europe's Painful Transition|url=|journal=Current History|volume=|pages=97–102|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnian Muslims suffered at the hands of the Serbs and Croats.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The war garnered assistance from groups; Muslim, Orthodox and Western Christian as well as state actors who supplied all sides; Saudi Arabia and Iran supported Bosnia, Russia supported Serbia, Central European and Western countries including the U.S. supported Croatia, and the Pope supported Slovenia and Croatia.

{{main|Neo-nationalism}}

[[Arab nationalism]] began to decline in the 21st century leading to localized nationalism, culminating in a series of revolts against authoritarian regimes between 2010 and 2012, known as the ''[[Arab Spring]]''. Following these revolts, which mostly failed to improve conditions in the affected nations, Arab nationalism and even most local nationalistic movements declined dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title=What is the point of the Arab League? | date=29 April 2016 | magazine=The Economist | url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21698047-sad-decline-once-bold-organisation-what-point-arab-league}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consequence of the [[Arab Spring]] as well as the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] were the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)|civil wars in Iraq]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], which eventually joined to form a [[Spillover of the Syrian Civil War|single conflict]]. However, a new form of Arab nationalism has developed in the wake of the [[Arab Winter]], embodied by Egyptian President [[Abdel Fatteh el-Sisi]], Saudi Crown Prince [[Mohammad bin Salman]] and UAE leader [[Mohammed bin Zayed]].

The rise of [[globalism]] in the late 20th century led to a rise in nationalism and [[populism]] in Europe and North America. This trend was further fueled by increased terrorism in the West (the [[September 11 attacks]] in the U.S. being a prime example), increasing unrest and civil wars in the Middle East, and [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|waves of Muslim refugees]] flooding into Europe ({{as of|2016|lc=y}} the refugee crisis appears to have peaked).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=American Nationalism and U.S. Foreign Policy from September 11 to the Iraq War | author= McCartney, Paul T. | date=Fall 2004 | journal=Political Science Quarterly | volume=119 | number=3 | publisher=The Academy of Political Science | jstor= 20202389 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Europe's New Identity: The Refugee Crisis and the Rise of Nationalism | author=Postelnicescu, Claudia | date=12 May 2016 | journal=European Journal of Psychology | pmc=4894286 | pmid=27298631 | doi=10.5964/ejop.v12i2.1191 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=203–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalist groups like Germany's [[Pegida]], France's [[National Front (France)|National Front]], and the [[UK Independence Party]] gained prominence in their respective nations advocating [[Opposition to immigration|restrictions on immigration]] to protect the local populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The New European Nationalism and the Migrant Crisis | author=Clark, Philip | date=12 November 2015 | website=Stanford Politics | url=https://stanfordpolitics.com/the-new-european-nationalism-and-the-migrant-crisis-e989a1a45ac3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP: Survey"&gt;{{cite newspaper | title=Surveys show Russian nationalism is on the rise.

In India, [[Hindu nationalism]] has gained ground due to the rise of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] and Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]]'s closely affiliated [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], emphasizing Hinduism as a guiding principle of the country as opposed to the secular stance taken by India's founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/what-hindu-nationalism-means-indias-future|date=6 June 2016|title=What Hindu Nationalism Means for India's Future|work=[[Stratfor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 referendum]], the British populace voted to withdraw the United Kingdom from the [[European Union]] (the so-called ''[[Brexit]]''). The result had been largely unexpected and was seen as a victory of [[populism]].

The [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential campaign]] saw the unprecedented rise of [[Donald Trump]], a businessman with no political experience who ran on a populist/nationalist platform and struggled to gain endorsements from mainstream political figures, even within his own party. Trump's slogans "''Make America Great Again''" and "''America First''" exemplified his campaign's repudiation of globalism and its staunchly nationalistic outlook. His unexpected victory in the election was seen as part of the same trend that had brought about the [[Brexit]] vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Lure of Greatness: England's Brexit and America's Trump | author=Barnett, Anthony | year=2017 | publisher=Random House | url=https://books.google.com/?id=wRWXDgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=trump+brexit| isbn=9781783524549 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 22, 2018, two weeks before the mid-term elections President Trump openly proclaimed that he was a nationalist to a cheering crowd at a rally in Texas in support of re-electing Sen.

In Japan, nationalist influences in the government developed over the course of the early 21 century, thanks in large part to the [[Nippon Kaigi]] organization. The new movement has advocated re-establishing Japan as a military power and revising historical narratives to support the notion of a moral and strong Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Tea Party Politics in Japan | author= Kato, Norihiro | date=12 September 2014 | newspaper=New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/opinion/tea-party-politics-in-japan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Japan's Resurgent Nationalism | author=Feffer, John | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-feffer/japans-resurgent-national_b_4609290.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Rodrigo Duterte]] became president of the [[Philippines]] running a distinctly nationalist campaign.

== Political science ==
Many political scientists have theorized about the foundations of the modern nation-state and the concept of sovereignty. The concept of nationalism in political science draws from these theoretical foundations. Philosophers like [[Machiavelli]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Hobbes]], and [[Rousseau]] conceptualized the state as the result of a "[[social contract]]" between rulers and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756223/obo-9780199756223-0151.xml?rskey=ZyiKL0&amp;result=121|title=The Nature of the State|last=Miller|first=Max|date=31 March 2016|website=Oxford Bibliographies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber|Weber]] provides the most commonly used definition of the state, "that human community which successfully lays claim to the monopoly of legitimate physical violence within a certain territory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weber: Political Writings|last=Weber|first=Max|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Cambridge: UK|pages=309–331}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Benedict Anderson]], nations are "[[Imagined Communities]]", or socially constructed institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imagined Communities: Reflections on the origins and spread of nationalism|last=Anderson|first=Benedict|publisher=Verso Books|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars have noted the relationship between state-building, war, and nationalism. Many scholars believe that the development of nationalism in Europe (and subsequently the modern nation-state) was due to the threat of war. "External threats have such a powerful effect on nationalism because people realize in a profound manner that they are under threat because of who they are as a nation; they are forced to recognize that it is only as a nation that they can successfully defeat the threat".&lt;sup&gt;[[Nationalism#cite note-herbst-war-and-state-62|[62]]]&lt;/sup&gt; With increased external threats, the state's extractive capacities increase. [[Jeffrey Herbst]] argues that the lack of external threats to countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, post-independence, is linked to weak state nationalism and state capacity .&lt;sup&gt;[[Nationalism#cite note-herbst-war-and-state-62|[62]]]&lt;/sup&gt; [[Barry Posen]] argues that nationalism increases the intensity of war, and that states deliberately promote nationalism with the aim of improving their military capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Posen|first=Barry|date=Fall 1993|title=Nationalism, the Mass Army, and Military Power|doi=10.2307/2539098|journal=International Security|volume=18|issue=2|pages=80–124|jstor=2539098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==
The sociological or modernist interpretation of nationalism and nation-building argues that nationalism arises and flourishes in modern societies that have an industrial economy capable of self-sustainability, a central supreme authority capable of maintaining authority and unity, and a centralized language understood by a community of people.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508–09}} Modernist theorists note that this is only possible in modern societies, while traditional societies typically lack the prerequisites for nationalism. They lack a modern self-sustainable economy, have divided authorities, and use multiple languages resulting in many groups being unable to communicate with each other.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508–09}}

Prominent theorists who developed the modernist interpretation of nations and nationalism include: [[Carlton J. H. Hayes]], [[Henry Maine]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Arnold Joseph Toynbee]] and [[Talcott Parsons]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508–09}}

Henry Maine in his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies noted the key distinction between traditional societies defined as "status" societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals; and modern societies defined as "contract" societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests. Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}

Ferdinand Tönnies in his book ''[[Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' (1887) defined a ''Gemeinschaft'' (community) as being based on emotional attachments as attributed with traditional societies, while defining a ''Gesellschaft'' (society) as an impersonal society that is modern. While he recognized the advantages of modern societies he also criticized them for their cold and impersonal nature that caused [[Social alienation|alienation]] while praising the intimacy of traditional communities.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}

Émile Durkheim expanded upon Tönnies' recognition of alienation, and defined the differences between traditional and modern societies as being between societies based upon "mechanical solidarity" versus societies based on "organic solidarity".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}} Durkheim identified mechanical solidarity as involving custom, habit, and repression that was necessary to maintain shared views. Durkheim identified organic solidarity-based societies as modern societies where there exists a division of labour based on social differentiation that causes alienation. Durkheim claimed that social integration in traditional society required authoritarian culture involving acceptance of a social order. Durkheim claimed that modern society bases integration on the mutual benefits of the division of labour, but noted that the impersonal character of modern urban life caused alienation and feelings of [[anomie]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}

Max Weber claimed the change that developed modern society and nations is the result of the rise of a charismatic leader to power in a society who creates a new tradition or a rational-legal system that establishes the supreme authority of the state. Weber's conception of charismatic authority has been noted as the basis of many nationalist governments.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}

===Primordialist evolutionary interpretation===
Another approach emerging from biology and psychology looks at long-term evolutionary forces that might lead to nationalism.  The primordialist perspective is based upon evolutionary theory.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=272–73}}&lt;ref&gt;David Goetze, "Evolution, mobility, and ethnic group formation." ''Politics and the Life Sciences'' (1998): 59–71. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4236409 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach has been popular with the general public but is typically rejected by experts. Laland and Brown report that "the vast majority of professional academics in the social sciences not only ... ignore evolutionary methods but in many cases [are] extremely hostile to the arguments" that draw vast generalizations from rather limited evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kevin N. Laland|author2=Gillian R. Brown|title=Sense and Nonsense: Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Behaviour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KcbFVBSxWYC&amp;pg=PA2|year=2011|publisher=Oxford UP|page=2|isbn=9780199586967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary theory of nationalism perceives nationalism to be the result of the evolution of human beings into identifying with groups, such as ethnic groups, or other groups that form the foundation of a nation.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=272–73}} Roger Masters in ''The Nature of Politics'' describes the primordial explanation of the origin of ethnic and national groups as recognizing group attachments that are thought to be unique, emotional, intense, and durable because they are based upon [[kinship]] and promoted along lines of common ancestry.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=273}}

The primordialist evolutionary views of nationalism often reference the evolutionary theories of [[Charles Darwin]] as well as [[Social Darwinist]] views of the late nineteenth century. Thinkers like [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Walter Bagehot]] reinterpreted Darwin's theory of natural selection "often in ways inconsistent with Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution" by making unsupported claims of biological difference among groups, ethnicities, races, and nations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=495-496}} Modern evolutionary sciences have distanced themselves from such views, but notions of long-term evolutionary change remain foundational to the work of evolutionary psychologists like [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=268}}

Approached through the primordialist perspective, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation's borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=271}} There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}} As such proximate environments cause people to make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}}
[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Nationalist and liberal pressure led to the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions of 1848]]]]

Critics argue that primordial models relying on evolutionary psychology are based not on historical evidence but on assumptions of unobserved changes over thousands of years and assume stable genetic composition of the population living in a specific area, and are incapable of handling the contingencies that characterize every known historical process. Robert Hislope argues:
:the articulation of cultural evolutionary theory represents theoretical progress over sociobiology, but its explanatory payoff remains limited due to the role of contingency in human affairs and the significance of non-evolutionary, proximate causal factors. While evolutionary theory undoubtedly elucidates the development of all organic life, it would seem to operate best at macro-levels of analysis, "distal" points of explanation, and from the perspective of the long-term. Hence, it is bound to display shortcomings at micro-level events that are highly contingent in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hislope "From Ontology to Analogy: Evolutionary Theories and the Explanation of Ethnic Politics: in Patrick James and David Goetze ed. ''Evolutionary Theory and Ethnic Conflict'' (2000) p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;
English Historian [[G. P. Gooch]] in 1920 argued that "While patriotism is as old as human association and has gradually widened its sphere from the clan and the tribe to the city and the state, nationalism as an operative principle and an articulate creed only made its appearance among the more complicated intellectual processes of the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G.P. Gooch|authorlink = George Peabody Gooch|title=Nationalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxqDAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA5|year=1920|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist interpretations===
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] declared in the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' that "the working men have no country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K. Marx, F. Engels|title=Manifesto of the Communist Party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vladimir Lenin]] supported the concept of self-determination.&lt;ref name="Smith (1983)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Anthony D.|title=Nationalism and Classical Social Theory|journal=The British Journal of Sociology|date=March 1983|volume=34|issue=1|pages=19–38|doi=10.2307/590606|jstor=590606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stalin]]'s ''[[Marxism and the National Question]]'' (1913) declares that "a nation is not a [[Race (human classification)|racial]] or [[Tribe|tribal]], but a historically constituted community of people;" "a nation is not a casual or ephemeral [[wiktionary:conglomeration|conglomeration]], but a stable community of people"; "a nation is formed only as a result of lengthy and systematic [[Interpersonal communication|intercourse]], as a result of people living together generation after generation"; and, in its entirety: "a nation is a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1913/03a.htm |title=Marxism and the National Question|last=Stalin|first=Joseph|website=marxists.org|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with Stalin at the helm in 1929 it was under attack.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} He criticized [[Nikolai Bukharin]]'s position that the proletariat was hostile to the [[Marx's theory of the state|inclinations of the state]], arguing that since the state (the Soviet Union) was in transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]] the relationship between the state and the proletariat was harmonious.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} By 1936, Stalin argued that the state would still exist if the Soviet Union reached the [[pure communism|communist mode of production]] if the socialist world was encircled by capitalist forces.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}}

==Varieties==
{{see also|Types of nationalism}}Historians, sociologists, and anthropologists have debated different types of nationalism since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wirth|first=Louis|date=1936-05-01|title=Types of Nationalism|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=41|issue=6|pages=723–737|doi=10.1086/217296|issn=0002-9602}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the most common way of classifying nationalism has been to describe movements as having either "civic" or "ethnic" nationalist characteristics. This distinction was popularized in the 1950s by Hans Kohn who described "civic" nationalism as "Western" and more democratic while depicting "ethnic" nationalism as "Eastern" and undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Idea of Nationalism: A Study of Its Origins and Background|last=Kohn|first=Hans|publisher=Macmillan|origyear=1944 |type=reprint|year=2005|isbn=9781412804769|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, however, scholars of nationalism have pointed out numerous flaws in this rigid division and proposed more specific classifications and numerous varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Philip|last2=Wollman|first2=Howard|date=1998-10-01|title=Good and bad nationalisms: A critique of dualism|journal=Journal of Political Ideologies|volume=3|issue=3|pages=255–274|doi=10.1080/13569319808420780|issn=1356-9317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yack|first=Bernard|date=1996-03-01|title=The myth of the civic nation|journal=Critical Review|volume=10|issue=2|pages=193–211|doi=10.1080/08913819608443417|issn=0891-3811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civic nationalism and liberal nationalism===
{{main|Civic nationalism}}Civic nationalism defines the nation as an association of people who identify themselves as belonging to the nation, who have equal and shared political rights, and allegiance to similar political procedures.&lt;ref name="blackwell"&gt;{{Cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to the principles of civic nationalism, the nation is not based on common ethnic ancestry, but is a political entity whose core identity is not ethnicity. This civic concept of nationalism is exemplified by [[Ernest Renan]] in his lecture in 1882 "[[What is a Nation?]]", where he defined the nation as a "daily referendum" (frequently translated "daily [[plebiscite]]") dependent on the will of its people to continue living together.&lt;ref name="blackwell"/&gt;

Civic nationalism is normally associated with [[liberal nationalism]], although the two are distinct, and did not always coincide. On the one hand, until the late 19th and early 20th century adherents to anti-Enlightenment movements such as French [[Legitimism]] or Spanish [[Carlism]] often rejected the liberal, national unitary state, yet identified themselves not with an ethnic nation but with a non-national dynasty and regional feudal privileges. Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a 'civic national' form, rejecting a given group's ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France). On the other hand, while subnational separatist movements were commonly associated with ethnic nationalism, this was not always so, and such nationalists as the [[Corsican Republic]], [[United Irishmen]], [[Breton Federalist League]] or [[Catalan Republican Party]] could combine a rejection of the unitary civic-national state with a belief in liberal universalism.

Liberal nationalism is kind of non-[[xenophobic]] nationalism that is claimed to be compatible with [[liberal values]] of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Tamir, Yael. 1993.

''Considerations on Representative Government.''&lt;/ref&gt; are often thought to be early liberal nationalists.

Civic nationalism lies within the traditions of [[rationalism]] and liberalism, but as a form of nationalism it is usually contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]]. Civic nationalism is correlated with long-established states whose dynastic rulers had gradually acquired multiple distinct territories, with little change to boundaries, but which contained historical populations of multiple linguistic and/or confessional backgrounds. Since individuals resident within different parts of the state territory might have little obvious common ground, civic nationalism developed as a way for rulers to both explain a contemporary reason for such heterogeneity and to provide a common purpose  ([[Ernest Renan]]'s classic description in [[What is a Nation?]] (1882) as a voluntary partnership for a common endeavour).  Renan argued that factors such as ethnicity, language, religion, economics, geography, ruling dynasty and historic military deeds were important but not sufficient. Needed was a spiritual soul that allowed as a "daily referendum" among the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singley | first1 = Carol J. | year = 2003 | title = Race, Culture, Nation: Edith Wharton and Ernest Renan | url = | journal = Twentieth Century Literature | volume = 49 | issue = 1| pages = 32–45 | doi=10.2307/3176007| jstor = 3176007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Civic-national ideals influenced the development of [[representative democracy]] in 
multiethnic countries such as the United States and France, as well as in constitutional monarchies such as Great Britain, Belgium and Spain.&lt;ref  name="google_2016_pg173"/&gt;

German philosopher Monika Kirloskar-Steinbach does not think liberalism and nationalism are compatible, but she points out there are many liberals who think they are. She states:
:Justifications of nationalism seem to be making a headway in political philosophy. Its proponents contend that liberalism and nationalism are not necessarily mutually exclusive and that they can in fact be made compatible. Liberal nationalists urge one to consider nationalism not as the pathology of modernity but as an answer to its malaise. For them, nationalism is more than an infantile disease, more than "the measles of mankind" as Einstein once proclaimed it to be. They argue that nationalism is a legitimate way of understanding one's role and place in life. They strive for a normative justification of nationalism which lies within liberal limits. The main claim which seems to be involved here is that as long as a nationalism abhors violence and propagates liberal rights and equal citizenship for all citizens of its state, its philosophical credentials can be considered to be sound.&lt;ref&gt;

===Ethnic nationalism=== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[White supremacy]] --&gt;
{{See also|Ethnic nationalism}}
Ethnic nationalism, also known as ethno-nationalism, is a form of nationalism wherein the "nation" is defined in terms of [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publiceye.org/fascist/third_position.html |title=The Website of Political Research Associates |publisher=PublicEye.org |date= |accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central theme of ethnic nationalists is that "nations are defined by a shared heritage, which usually includes a [[common language]], a common faith, and a [[Y-DNA haplogroups by ethnic group|common ethnic ancestry]]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Muller, Jerry Z. "Us and Them." Current  Issue 501 Mar/Apr 2008 9–14&lt;/ref&gt;  It also includes ideas of a [[culture]] shared between members of the group, and with their ancestors. However, it is different from a purely cultural definition of "the nation," which allows people to become members of a nation by [[cultural assimilation]]; and from a purely linguistic definition, according to which "the nation" consists of all speakers of a specific language.

Whereas nationalism in and of itself does not imply a belief in the superiority of one ethnicity or country over others, some nationalists support [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] supremacy or protectionism.

The humiliation of being a second-class citizen led regional minorities in multiethnic states, such as Great Britain, Spain, France, Germany, Russia and the Ottoman Empire, to define nationalism in terms of loyalty to their minority culture, especially language and religion. Forced assimilation was anathema.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Baycroft, ''Nationalism in Europe 1789-1945'' (1998) p 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the politically dominate cultural group, assimilation was necessary to minimize disloyalty and treason and therefore became a major component of nationalism. A second factor for the politically dominant group was competition with neighboring states—nationalism involved a rivalry, especially in terms of military prowess and economic strength.&lt;ref&gt;Baycroft, ''Nationalism in Europe 1789-1945'' (1998) p 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic nationalism===
{{See also|Economic nationalism}}
'''Economic nationalism''', or '''economic patriotism''', refers to an ideology that favors [[Economic interventionism|state interventionism]] in the economy, with policies that emphasize domestic control of the economy, labor, and [[capital formation]], even if this requires the imposition of [[tariff]]s and other restrictions on the movement of labor, goods and capital.

===Religious nationalism===
{{main|Religious nationalism}}
Religious nationalism is the relationship of nationalism to a particular religious belief, dogma, or affiliation where a shared religion can be seen to contribute to a sense of national unity, a common bond among the citizens of the nation. [[Saudi Arabia]]n, [[Iran]]ian, [[Egypt]]ian, [[Iraq]]i, and the [[Pakistani-Islamic nationalism]] ([[Two-Nation Theory]]), are some examples.

===Left-wing nationalism===

[[Left-wing nationalism]] (occasionally known as socialist nationalism, not to be confused with [[national socialism]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119472227/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |title=Class and Nation: Problems of Socialist Nationalism|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1987.tb01886.x|year=2006|volume=35|issue=2|journal=Political Studies|pages=239–255|last1=Schwarzmantel|first1=J. J}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to any political movement that combines [[left-wing politics]] with nationalism.

Many nationalist movements are dedicated to [[national liberation]], in the view that their nations are being persecuted by other nations and thus need to exercise [[self-determination]] by liberating themselves from the accused persecutors. [[Anti-Revisionism|Anti-revisionist]] [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninism]] is closely tied with this ideology, and practical examples include Stalin's early work ''[[Marxism and the National Question]]'' and his [[socialism in one country]] edict, which declares that nationalism can be used in an internationalist context, fighting for national liberation without racial or religious divisions.

Other examples of left-wing nationalism include [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[26th of July Movement]] that launched the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959, [[Cornwall]]'s [[Mebyon Kernow]], Ireland's [[Sinn Féin]], [[Wales]]'s [[Plaid Cymru]], the [[Awami League]] in Bangladesh, the [[African National Congress]] in South Africa and numerous movements in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Zuzowski, "The Left and Nationalism in Eastern Europe" ''East European Quarterly'', 41#4 (2008) [https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-173464008/the-left-and-nationalism-in-eastern-europe online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. Motyl, ed., ''Encyclopedia of Nationalism'' (2 vol. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Territorial nationalism===
{{Main|Territorial nationalism}}Some nationalists exclude certain groups. Some nationalists, defining the national community in ethnic, linguistic, cultural, historic, or religious terms (or a combination of these), may then seek to deem certain minorities as not truly being a part of the 'national community' as they define it. Sometimes a mythic homeland is more important for the national identity than the actual territory occupied by the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Anthony D. 1986. The Ethnic Origins of Nations London: Basil Blackwell. pp. 6–18. {{ISBN|0-631-15205-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Brasil ame-o ou deixe-o.png|thumb|Nationalist slogan "''Brazil, love it or leave it''", used during the [[Brazilian military government|Brazilian military dictatorship]]]]

Territorial nationalists assume that all inhabitants of a particular nation owe allegiance to their country of birth or adoption .&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1BmPsVvbbdQC&amp;pg=PA22 Middle East and North Africa: Challenge to Western Security] by Peter Duignan and L.H. Gann, [[Hoover Institution Press]], 1981, {{ISBN|978-0-8179-7392-6}} p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; A sacred quality is sought in the nation and in the popular memories it evokes.  Citizenship is idealized by territorial nationalists. A criterion of a territorial nationalism is the establishment of a mass, public culture based on common values, codes and traditions of the population.{{sfn|Leoussi|2001|p=62}}

===Integral nationalism, irredentism, and pan-nationalism===
{{main|Integral nationalism|Irredentism|Pan-nationalism}}
There are different types of nationalism including Risorgimento nationalism and Integral nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ruiGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=Peter+Alter++Risorgimento|title=Contemporary Nationalism|publisher=|isbn=978-1134695416|last1=Brown|first1=David|date=2003-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Integral nationalism is one of five types of nationalism defined by [[Carlton Hayes]] in his 1928 book ''The Historical Evolution of Modern Nationalism.''&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas risorgimento nationalism applies to a nation seeking to establish a liberal state (for example the [[Risorgimento]] in Italy and similar movements in [[Greece]], Germany, [[Poland]] during the 19th century or the [[civic nationalism|civic]] [[American nationalism]]), integral nationalism results after a nation has achieved independence and has established a state. [[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism.

Some of the qualities that characterize integral nationalism are [[anti-individualism]], [[statism]], radical extremism, and aggressive-expansionist militarism. The term Integral Nationalism often overlaps with fascism, although many natural points of disagreement exist. Integral nationalism arises in countries where a strong military ethos has become entrenched through the independence struggle, when, once independence is achieved, it is believed that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.

Pan-nationalism is unique in that it covers a large area span. Pan-nationalism focuses more on "clusters" of ethnic groups. [[Pan-Slavism]] is one example of Pan-nationalism. The goal is to unite all [[Slavic people]] into one country. They did succeed by uniting several [[South Slavs|south Slavic]] people into [[Yugoslavia]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Ivo Banac, ''The National Question in Yugoslavia'' (Cornell University Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-colonial nationalism===
[[File:Crowd demonstrates against Great Britain in Cairo.jpg|thumb|Crowd demonstrates against Britain in [[Cairo]] on 23 October 1951 as tension continued to mount in the dispute between Egypt and Britain over control of the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].]]
This form of nationalism came about during the [[decolonization]] of the post war periods. It was a reaction mainly in Africa and Asia against being subdued by foreign powers. It also appeared in the non-Russian territories of the Tsarist empire and later, the USSR, where Ukrainianists and Islamic Marxists condemned Russian Bolshevik rule in their territories as a renewed Russian imperialism. This form of nationalism took many guises, including the peaceful passive resistance movement led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Moyra|title=Politics Review|url=http://moodle.collyers.ac.uk/file.php/465/Politics_Review_articles/nationalism_expansionistanddesrtuctive.pdf|publisher=Politics Review|accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benedict Anderson argued that anti-colonial nationalism is grounded in the experience of literate and bilingual indigenous intellectuals fluent in the language of the imperial power, schooled in its "national" history, and staffing the colonial administrative cadres up to but not including its highest levels. Post-colonial national governments have been essentially indigenous forms of the previous imperial administration.{{sfn|Anderson|1983|pp=37–46}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Velychenko |first1=Stephen |date=October 2012 |title=Ukrainia Anticolonialist Thought in Comparative Perspective |journal=Ab Imperio |issue=4 |page=339 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/85287169/ukrainia-anticolonialist-thought-comparative-perspective-preliminary-overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial nationalism===
{{main|Racial nationalism}}
Racial nationalism is an ideology that advocates a racial definition of national identity. Racial nationalism seeks to preserve a given race through policies such as [[Anti-miscegenation laws|banning race mixing]] and the [[immigration]] of other races. Specific examples are [[black nationalism]] and [[white nationalism]].

===Sports nationalism===
{{main|Nationalism and sport}}
Sport spectacles like football's World Cup command worldwide audiences as nations battle for supremacy and the fans invest intense support for their national team. Increasingly people have tied their loyalties and even their cultural identity to national teams.&lt;ref&gt;Grant Jarvie and Wray Vamplew, ''Sport, nationalism and cultural identity'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; The globalization of audiences through television and other media has generated revenues from advertisers and subscribers in the billions of dollars, as the FIFA Scandals of 2015 revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jennings, ''The Dirty Game: Uncovering the Scandal at FIFA'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Kingston looks at football, the Commonwealth Games, baseball, cricket, and the Olympics and finds that, "The capacity of sports to ignite and amplify nationalist passions and prejudices is as extraordinary as is their power to console, unify, uplift and generate goodwill."&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Kingston, ''Nationalism in Asia: A History Since 1945'' (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;  The phenomenon is evident across most of the world.&lt;ref&gt;H. Fernández L’Hoeste et al. ''Sports and Nationalism in Latin/o America'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bairner, ''Sport, nationalism, and globalization: European and North American perspectives'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwang Ok, ''Transformation of Modern Korean Sport: Imperialism, Nationalism, Globalization'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Empire]] strongly emphasized sports among its soldiers and agents across the world, and often the locals joined in enthusiastically.&lt;ref&gt;P. McDevitt, ''May the Best Man Win: Sport, Masculinity, and Nationalism in Great Britain and the Empire, 1880–1935'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  It established a high prestige competition in 1930, named the British Empire Games from 1930–50, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games from 1954–66, British Commonwealth Games from 1970–74 and since then the [[Commonwealth Games]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Perkin]], "Teaching the nations how to play: sport and society in the British empire and Commonwealth." ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 6#2 (1989): 145–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Empire was not far behind the British in the use of sports to strengthen colonial solidarity with France. Colonial officials promoted and subsidized gymnastics, table games, and dance and helped football spread to French colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Driss Abbassi, "Le sport dans l'empire français: un instrument de domination?." ''Outre-mers'' 96.364 (2009): 5–15. [http://www.persee.fr/doc/outre_1631-0438_2009_num_96_364_4411 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gendered and muscular nationalism ===
Feminist critique interprets nationalism as a mechanism through which sexual control and repression are justified and legitimised, often by a dominant masculine power. The [[gender]]ing of nationalism through socially constructed notions of [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]] not only shapes what masculine and feminine participation in the building of that nation will look like, but also how the nation will be imagined by nationalists.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=Sikata|title=Gender and nationalism: the masculinization of hinduism and female political participation in india|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277539503000190|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|volume=26|issue=2|pages=167–179|doi=10.1016/s0277-5395(03)00019-0|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nation having its own identity is viewed as necessary, and often inevitable, and these identities are gendered.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mackay|first=Eva|date=2000|title=Death by Landscape: Race, Nature and Gender in the Canadian  Nationalist Mythology|url=http://cws.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/cws/article/view/7618/6749|journal=Canadian Woman Studies|volume=20|pages=125–130|via=Journals.Yorku}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical land itself is often gendered as female (i.e. "Motherland"), with a body in constant danger of violation by foreign males, while national pride and protectiveness of "her" borders is gendered as masculine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Woman and War Reader|last=Peterson|first=Spike V.|publisher=New York University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0814751459|editor-last=Turpin|editor-first=Jennifer|location=New York|pages=41–49|chapter=Gendered nationalism: Reproducing "Us" versus "Them"|editor-last2=Lorentzen|editor-first2=Lois Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US_Patriotic_Army_Recruiting_Poster_WW2_Then_Now_Forever.jpg|thumb|World War II United States Patriotic Army Recruiting Poster]]
History, political ideologies, and religions place most nations along a continuum of muscular nationalism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Muscular nationalism conceptualises a nation's identity as being derived from muscular or masculine attributes that are unique to a particular country.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; If definitions of nationalism and gender are understood as socially and culturally constructed, the two may be constructed in conjunction by invoking an [[Ingroups and outgroups|"us" versus "them" dichotomy]] for the purpose of the exclusion of the so-called "other," who is used to reinforce the unifying ties of the nation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The empowerment of one gender, nation or sexuality tends to occur at the expense and disempowerment of another; in this way, nationalism can be used as an instrument to perpetuate [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] structures of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Ironies of Nationalism|last=Mayer|first=Tamar|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gendered manner in which dominant nationalism has been imagined in most states in the world has had important implications on not only individual's lived experience, but on international relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robidoux|first=Michael A.|date=2002|title=Imagining a Canadian Identity through Sport: A Historical Interpretation of Lacrosse and Hockey|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|volume=115|issue=456|pages=209–225|doi=10.2307/4129220|jstor=4129220}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colonialism]] is heavily connected to muscular nationalism, from research linking [[British Empire|British]] [[hegemonic masculinity]] and [[empire-building]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; to [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] oppression being justified by colonialist images of “others”, a practice integral in the formation of Western identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orientalism|last=Said|first=Edward|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1979|isbn=978-0-394-74067-6|location=New York|pages=1–368}}&lt;/ref&gt; This “othering” may come in the form of [[orientalism]], whereby the East is [[Feminization (sociology)|feminized]] and [[Sexualization|sexualized]] by the West. The imagined feminine East, or “other,” exists in contrast to the masculine West.

The status of conquered nations can become a causality dilemma: the nation was “conquered because they were effeminate and seen as effeminate because they were conquered.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In defeat they are considered militaristically unskilled, not aggressive, and thus not muscular. In order for a nation to be considered “proper”, it must possess the male-gendered characteristics of virility, as opposed to the stereotypically female characteristics of subservience and dependency.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Muscular nationalism is often inseparable from the concept of a [[warrior]], which shares [[Ideology|ideological]] commonalities across many nations; they are defined by the masculine notions of aggression, willingness to engage in war, decisiveness, and muscular strength, as opposed to the feminine notions of peacefulness, weakness, non-violence, and compassion.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This masculinized image of a warrior has been theorised to be “the culmination of a series of gendered historical and social processes" played out in a national and international context.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Ideas of cultural dualism—of a martial man and chaste woman—which are implicit in muscular nationalism, underline the [[Race (human categorization)|raced]], [[Social class|classed]], [[gender]]ed, and [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] nature of dominant national identity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Nations and gender systems are mutually supportive [[Social constructionism|constructions]]: the nation fulfils the masculine ideals of comradeship and brotherhood.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waetjen|first=Thembisa|date=2001|title=The Limits of Gender Rhetoric for Nationalism: A Case Study from Southern Africa|journal=Theory and Society|volume=30|pages=121–152|doi=10.1023/a:1011099627847|jstor=658064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masculinity has been cited as a notable factor in producing political militancy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A common feature of national crisis is a drastic shift in the socially acceptable ways of being a man,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alison|first=Miranda|date=2007|title=Wartime Sexual Violence: Women's Human Rights and Questions of Masculinity|jstor=20097951|journal=Review of International Studies|volume=33|pages=75–90|doi=10.1017/s0260210507007310|url=&lt;!-- Disable Citation_bot.

==Criticisms==
{{See also|Internationalism (politics)|Anti-nationalism}}
Critics of nationalism have argued that it is often unclear what constitutes a "nation", or whether a nation is a legitimate unit of political rule. Nationalists hold that the boundaries of a nation and a state should coincide with one another, thus nationalism tends to oppose [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref name = Heywood&gt;{{cite book| last=Heywood| first=Andrew|title=Political Theory: An Introduction|publisher=Macmillan Press| location=London| year=1999| edition=2nd|pages=97–98|isbn=0-333-76091-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, nationalism serves to marginalize minorities who live within a [[nation-state]] but do not share the necessary characteristics to be considered part of the nation.&lt;ref name = Aguettant&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aguettant | first1 = Joseph | year = 1996 | title = Impact of Population Registration on Hill Tribe Development in Thailand | journal = Asia-Pacific Population Journal | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 47–72.| pmid = 12347778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Laungaramsri&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Laungaramsri | first1 = Pinkaew | year = 2003 | chapter = Constructing Marginality: The Hill Tribe Karen and Their Shifting Locations within Thai State and Public Perspectives | title = Living at the Edge of Thai Society: The Karen in the Highlands of Northern Thailand | editor = Claudio Delang | publisher = RoutledgeCurzon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also lead to conflict when more than one national group finds itself claiming rights to a particular territory or seeking to take control of the state.&lt;ref name="Triandafyllidou"/&gt;

Philosopher [[A.C. Grayling]] describes nations as artificial constructs, "their boundaries drawn in the blood of past wars". He argues that "there is no country on earth which is not home to more than one different but usually coexisting culture. Cultural heritage is not the same thing as national identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.C.|title=The Meaning of Things: Applying Philosophy to Life.|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson| location=London| year=2001| pages=78–79| isbn=0-297-60758-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationalism is inherently divisive because it highlights perceived differences between people, emphasizing an individual's identification with their own nation. The idea is also potentially oppressive because it submerges individual identity within a national whole, and gives elites or political leaders potential opportunities to manipulate or control [[Common people|the masses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heywood|first=Andrew|title=Key Concepts in Politics|publisher=Macmillan Press|location=London|year=2000|page=256|isbn=0-333-77095-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the early opposition to nationalism was related to its geopolitical ideal of a separate state for every nation. The classic nationalist movements of the 19th century rejected the very existence of the multi-ethnic empires in Europe. Even in that early stage, however, there was an ideological critique of nationalism. That has developed into several forms of [[Internationalism (politics)|Internationalism]] and [[anti-nationalism]]. The [[Islamic revival]] of the 20th century also produced an [[Islamism|Islamist]] critique of the nation-state. (see [[Pan-Islamism]])&lt;ref&gt;''[[World Book Encyclopedia]], 2018 ed., s.v. "Muslims"&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th century, [[Marxism|Marxists]] and other [[socialism|socialists]] and [[communism|communists]] (such as [[Rosa Luxemburg]]) produced political analysis that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in [[central Europe|central]] and eastern Europe, although a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from [[Vladimir Lenin]] (a communist) to [[Józef Piłsudski]] (a socialist), were more sympathetic to national [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1959/rosalux/6-natquest.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg and the national question |accessdate=2008-08-02|last=Cliff |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Cliff|year=1959|publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his classic essay on the topic [[George Orwell]] distinguishes nationalism from patriotism, which he defines as devotion to a particular place. Nationalism, more abstractly, is "power-hunger tempered by self-deception."&lt;ref name=NonN&gt;George Orwell, [http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat Notes on Nationalism], [http://orwell.ru orwell.ru].&lt;/ref&gt;

For Orwell, the nationalist is more likely than not dominated by irrational negative impulses:

{{quote|There are, for example, Trotskyists who have become simply enemies of the U.S.S.R. without developing a corresponding loyalty to any other unit. When one grasps the implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist—that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating—but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him.&lt;ref name=NonN /&gt;}}

In the [[liberalism|liberal political tradition]] there was mostly a negative attitude toward nationalism as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states.  The historian [[Lord Acton]] put the case against "nationalism as insanity" in 1862. He argued that nationalism suppresses minorities, it places country above moral principles and especially it creates a dangerous individual attachment to the state.  However Acton opposed democracy and was trying to defend the pope from Italian nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lang | first1 = Timothy | year = 2002 | title = Lord Acton and 'the Insanity of Nationality' | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 63 | issue = 1| pages = 129–49 | jstor=3654261 | doi=10.2307/3654261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 20th century liberals have been increasingly divided, with some philosophers such as [[Michael Walzer]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] emphasizing that a liberal society needed to be based in a stable nation state.&lt;ref&gt;Motyl 1:298&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pacifism|pacifist]] critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of nationalist movements, the associated [[militarism]], and on conflicts between nations inspired by [[jingoism]] or [[chauvinism]]. National symbols and patriotic assertiveness are in some countries discredited by their historical link with past wars, especially in Germany. British pacifist [[Bertrand Russell]] criticizes nationalism for diminishing the individual's capacity to judge his or her fatherland's foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;''Russell Speaks His Mind'', 1960. Fletcher and son Ltd., Norwich, United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fair-use.org/international-journal-of-ethics/1915/01/the-ethics-of-war |title=The ethics of war |accessdate=2018-07-05|last=Russell |first=Bertrand |authorlink=Bertrand Russell|year=1915|publisher=[[International Journal of Ethics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] stated that "Nationalism is an infantile disease.&amp;nbsp;It is the measles of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Viereck |first=George Sylvester |title=What Life Means to Einstein |url=http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/what_life_means_to_einstein.pdf |accessdate=2013-05-19 |newspaper=[[The Saturday Evening Post]] |date=26 October 1929 |authorlink=George Sylvester Viereck|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oxford Oath''', or '''Oxford Pledge''', is the name commonly given to a resolution carried by students of the [[Oxford Union]] that "this House will in no circumstances fight for its King and Country". It was passed by 275 votes to 153 at [[the King and Country debate]] on 9 February 1933.&lt;ref name="times-online"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and "caused reverberations around the world".&lt;ref name="times-online" /&gt; It has been claimed by one [[Joseph Alsop]] that the resolution made a tremendous impression upon [[Adolf Hitler]]; he regularly cited it when his general staff protested against his military decisions.&lt;ref name="st.petersburg" /&gt;

[[Winston Churchill]], later [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], denounced the resolution as "that abject, squalid, shameless avowal". In the knowledge that ten days beforehand Hitler had become [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|chancellor]] of [[Germany]], he continued:

{{Quote|text=I think of Germany, with its splendid clear-eyed youths marching forward on all the roads of the [[Reich]] singing their ancient songs, demanding to be [[conscripted]] into an army; eagerly seeking the most terrible weapons of war; burning to suffer and die for their fatherland. I think of [[Italy]], with her ardent [[Fascisti]], her renowned Chief, and stern sense of national duty. I think of France, anxious, peace-loving, pacifist to the core, but armed to the teeth and determined to survive as a great nation in the world. One can almost feel the curl of contempt upon the lips of the manhood of these peoples when they read this message sent out by [[Oxford University]] in the name of young [[England]].|author=Winston Churchill|source=&lt;ref name="times-online" /&gt;}}

===US oath===
On 12 April 1935, 60,000 college students signed a [[United States]] equivalent of the resolution, calling it the Oxford Oath, swearing never to take up arms on behalf of king or country.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;https://www.jstor.org/pss/3641185&lt;/ref&gt; At Columbia University, 3,000 students took the Oath that day during a rally featuring [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Roger Baldwin]], [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and [[James Wechsler]] as speakers.&lt;ref name="leter2editor"&gt;http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/nov99/nov99_letterseditor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
The official framed copy of the oath was stolen in 2004.&lt;ref name="times-online" /&gt;

{{other uses|Performance testing (disambiguation)}}

The '''performance test''' or "PT" is a section of the [[bar exam]] that is intended to mimic a real-life legal task that future lawyers may face. Of the three parts of most states' bar exams -- [[Multistate Bar Examination|MBE]], [[essay]], and PT—the PT is probably the most reflective of how well a candidate will perform outside of an academic setting.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

A performance test may include tasks such as writing a legal [[memorandum]], drafting an [[affidavit]], or drafting a [[settlement (law)|settlement]] offer letter to opposing [[counsel]].

[[Performance testing (disambiguation)|Performance testing]] as part of a technical specification is covered on a different page.

==California PT==
Through February 2017, the California bar exam spanned three days, and included two performance test sections, one the first day (Tuesday) and one the last day (Thursday).  Each PT lasted three hours and the two PTs were worth 26% of the total score.  The types of tasks asked are:
# [[Legal memorandum]]
# Persuasive [[Brief (law)|brief]]
# [[Declaration (law)|Declaration]] or [[affidavit]]
# Closing argument
# Opening statement
# [[Jury instructions]]
# Witness cross or direct examination
# [[Discovery (process)|Discovery]]/investigation plan
# [[Client letter]]
# Client or witness interview
# Negotiation, settlement proposal or agreement
# Analysis of a contract, will, trust or statute
# Legislation
# Alternative dispute resolution task

Each PT has a file and a library.  The file contains factual materials about the case while the library contains the legal authorities needed. The candidates can either hand write or type using a laptop.

Effective July 2017, the California bar exam will be only two days, with one 90-minute PT on the first afternoon (Tuesday).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Admissions/Examinations/California-Bar-Examination/July-2017-California-Bar-Examination&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multistate Performance Test==
{{main|Multistate Performance Test}}
This is a test drafted by the [[National Conference of Bar Examiners]] (NCBE), modeled after the California test and intended as a supplement to NCBE's [[Multistate Essay Examination]]. NCBE currently offers three different performance tests, each 90 minutes long (as opposed to three hours in California). As of July 2007, 33 jurisdictions use the MPT.

==Personal life==
Before the founding of the Pirate Bay Sunde worked for a large German medical company. In 2003 he became a member of Sweden's [[Piratbyrån]] (The Pirate Bureau) and a few months later Sunde, [[Fredrik Neij]] and [[Gottfrid Svartholm]] started [[The Pirate Bay]] with Sunde as the spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bays-founding-group-piratbyran-disbands-100623/ |title=Pirate Bay’s Founding Group ‘Piratbyrån’ Disbands |publisher=TorrentFreak |date=2010-06-23 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained The Pirate Bay's spokesperson until late 2009 (three years after the ownership of the site transferred to Reservella). In August 2011 Sunde and fellow Pirate Bay co-founder [[Fredrik Neij]] launched file-sharing site [[BayFiles]], that aims to legally share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/The-Pirate-Bay-Bayfiles-Dropbox-Peter-Sunde-Fredrik-Neij,news-12362.html |title=Pirate Bay Founders Launch "Legal" File-Sharing Site |publisher=Tomsguide.com |date=2011-08-31 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunde is [[vegan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/02/pirate_wednesda/|title=Pirate Bay Crew Chums Up to Foes Over Lunch|first=Wired|last=Staff|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and speaks Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, English and German.

Peter Sunde ran for [[European Parliament]] in [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Finland)|2014 election]] with the [[Pirate Party (Finland)|Pirate Party of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-cofounder-to-run-for-european-parliament-130514/|title=Pirate Bay Co-Founder to Run For European Parliament - TorrentFreak|date=14 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2014, just days after the EU elections and exactly eight years after the police raided The Pirate Bay servers, Sunde was arrested at a farm in [[Oxie]], [[Malmö]] to serve his prison sentence for the Pirate Bay case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://revolution-news.com/pirate-bay-spokesperson-peter-sunde-arrested-sweden/|title=The Pirate Bay Spokesperson Peter Sunde Arrested in Sweden, Revolution News|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423131436/https://revolution-news.com/pirate-bay-spokesperson-peter-sunde-arrested-sweden/|archivedate=23 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released five months later after having served two-thirds of his eight-month sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/11/pirate-bay-co-founder-peter-sunde-freed-after-8-months-in-prison/|title=Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde freed after 5 months in prison|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Pirate Bay trial==
{{Main|The Pirate Bay trial}}
On 31 January 2008, [[The Pirate Bay]] operators – Sunde, [[Fredrik Neij]], [[Gottfrid Svartholm]] and [[Carl Lundström]] ([[CEO]] of The Pirate Bay's former [[ISP]]) – were charged with ''"assisting [others in] copyright infringement"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/01/pirate-bay-futu.html|title=Pirate Bay Future Uncertain After Operators Busted|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[The Pirate Bay Trial|trial]] began on 16 February 2009. On 17 April 2009, Sunde and his co-defendants were found to be guilty of "assisting in making copyright content available" in the [[Stockholm District Court]]. Each defendant was sentenced to one year in prison and ordered to pay damages of 30 million [[Swedish krona|SEK]] (approximately [[€]]2,740,900 or [[United States dollar|US$]]3,620,000), to be apportioned among the four defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-trial-the-verdict-090417/|title=The Pirate Bay Trial: The Official Verdict - Guilty - TorrentFreak|date=17 April 2009|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the verdict a press conference was held where Sunde held up a handwritten IOU statement claiming that is all the damages he will pay, adding "Even if I had any money I would rather burn everything I own and not even give them the ashes. They could have the job of picking them up. That's how much I hate the media industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/apr/17/pirate-bay-verdict-peter-sunder-kolmisoppi-online-press-conference | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jemima | last=Kiss | title=Pirate Bay defendant: we can't and won't pay | date=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendants' lawyers appealed to the [[Svea Court of Appeal]] together with a request for a retrial in the district court claiming bias on the part of judge Tomas Norström.&lt;ref name=localretrial&gt;{{cite news |date=2009-04-23 |title=Pirate Bay lawyer calls for retrial |url=http://www.thelocal.se/19028/20090423/ |publisher=[[The Local]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The district court ruled there was no bias and denied the request for a retrial. On appeal, the jail sentences were reduced, but the damages increased. The supreme court of Sweden subsequently refused to hear any further appeal.

Segments of an interview with Sunde talking about [[copyright]], the [[Internet]], and [[culture]] are featured in the 2007 documentary ''[[Steal This Film]]'' and 2013 documentary ''[[TPB AFK]]''.

==Flattr==
{{main|Flattr}}
[[Flattr]] is a [[micropayment]]s system started by Sunde and Linus Olsson, which enables viewers of websites to make small donations to the developer by clicking a "Flattr this" button. At the time of the projects's announcement in February 2010, Sunde explained that "the money you pay each month will be spread evenly among the buttons you click in a month. We want to encourage people to share money as well as content."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8512263.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Pirate boss to make the web pay |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flattr itself takes a 10% administration fee.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

After [[WikiLeaks]]'s initial publication of the U.S. Diplomatic Cables, companies including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Moneybookers blocked donations and money transfers to the site. Flattr, however, continued allowing donations to WikiLeaks. Sunde commented "We [Flattr] think their work is exactly what is needed and if we can help just a little bit, we will."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.ktradionetwork.com/tag/peter-sunde-kolmisoppi/ |title=Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi : Kevin Trudeau Show |publisher=Ktradionetwork.com |date=2010-08-23 |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330091836/http://www.ktradionetwork.com/tag/peter-sunde-kolmisoppi/ |archivedate=30 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 April 2017, Adblock Plus publisher Eyeo GmbH announced that it had acquired Flattr for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/05/adblock-plus-acquires-flattr/|title=The company behind Adblock Plus is acquiring micropayment service Flattr|last=Ha|first=Anthony|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hemlis==
On 9 July 2013, Peter Sunde, together with Leif Högberg and Linus Olsson, announced a fundraising campaign for Hemlis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hemlismessenger.wordpress.com/2013/07/09/hello-world-we-are-fundraising/|title=Protected Blog › Log in|website=hemlismessenger.wordpress.com|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal was to launch a mass market messenger that was private, secure and beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founder-announces-encrypted-nsa-proof-communication-apps-130710/|title=Pirate Bay Founder to Launch NSA-proof Messenger App - TorrentFreak|date=10 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 2015, the Hemlis team announced that they were discontinuing the development of the Hemlis messaging platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hemlismessenger.wordpress.com/2015/04/22/sometimes-you-understand/|title=Protected Blog › Log in|website=hemlismessenger.wordpress.com|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kopimashin ==
On 14 December 2015, Sunde released a video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/148955816 |title=KH000//Kopimashin |date=14 December 2015 |access-date=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on his [[Vimeo]] account of a device called "Kopimashin", a machine made with a [[Raspberry Pi]] running a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] routine to produce 100 copies per second of [[Gnarls Barkley]]'s single "[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]", redirecting the copies to ''/dev/null'' (where the data is discarded), surpassing eight million copies per day.

The following day, Sunde published the full description of the device and project at ''Konsthack'' as the first art project of the site's portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://konsthack.se/portfolio/kh000-kopimashin/ |title=Konsthack &gt; Portfolio &gt; KH000 // Kopimashin |date=15 December 2015 |access-date=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The machine has an LCD screen (as shown in the video) that calculates a running tally of the damages it has supposedly inflicted upon the record industry through its use, accordingly to what [[RIAA]] claims on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/physicalpiracy.php?content_selector=piracy_details_online |title=RIAA &gt; Piracy Online &gt; Who Music Theft Hurts |access-date=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If RIAA's claims are valid, it also means the record industry is supposed to bankrupt soon due to Kopimashin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/physicalpiracy.php?content_selector=piracy-online-scope-of-the-problem |title=RIAA &gt; Piracy Online &gt; Scope of the Problem |access-date=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim the project seeks to disprove with a physical example.

A few days later, Sunde told news site TorrentFreak that Kopimashin was created to "show the absurdity on the process of putting a value to a copy", and that "putting a price to a copy is futile."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founder-builds-the-ultimate-piracy-machine-151219 |title=Pirate Bay Founder Builds the Ultimate Piracy Machine |date=19 December 2015 |access-date=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also noting that it's merely an act against the record industry itself and recording labels, who have claimed millions of dollars in losses to the music industry to be caused by Sunde and The Pirate Bay over the past years.

[[File:Peter Williamson, otherwise known as "Indian Peter".jpg|thumb|"Indian Peter" dressed as a Delaware Indian]]
'''Peter Williamson''' (1730 – 19 January 1799), aka '''"Indian Peter"''', was a Scottish memoirist who was part-showman, part-entrepreneur and inventor. Born in a [[Croft (land)|croft]] in Aberdeenshire, he was forcibly taken to North America at an early age, but succeeded in returning to Scotland where he eventually became a well-known character in 18th century [[Edinburgh]]. He adopted the pseudonym "Indian Peter" due to his time spent with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native Americans]] and his self-exploitation of this in an autobiography and by touring Scotland and England in the guise of a "Red Indian".

==Early life==
Williamson was born the son of James Williamson in a [[Croft (land)|croft]] in Hirnlay near [[Aboyne]]. He described his parents as "reputable though not rich" and at an early age was sent to live with a maiden aunt in [[Aberdeen]].&lt;ref name="gillon"&gt;J K Gillon, Eccentric Edinburgh, Moubray House, Edinburgh 1990, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Though little acknowledged in history, there was in those days a thriving [[slave trade]] in stolen children, most of whom were taken to North America.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In January 1743, Williamson fell victim to the trade when he was kidnapped while playing on the quay at Aberdeen.&lt;ref&gt;D Daiches, Edinburgh, Hamish Hamilton, London 1978, p.139&lt;/ref&gt; His autobiography gives his age as eight at the time. Some of the Aberdeen [[baillie|bailies]] were suspected of colluding with the traffickers; an estimated 600 children disappeared from the port when the trade was at its height between 1740 and 1746.&lt;ref name="gillon"/&gt;

==The Plantation==
Williamson was taken to [[Philadelphia]] and sold for £16&lt;ref name="gillon"/&gt; as an [[indentured servant]] for a period of seven years to a fellow Scot, Hugh Wilson. Wilson had himself been kidnapped as a boy and sold into slavery, but, like many white slaves, had earned his freedom. He may have therefore sympathised with Peter's situation.

Williamson said Wilson treated him kindly, and when the latter died in 1750, just before the end of the indenture, he bequeathed the boy £120 plus his best horse and saddle and all his clothes.&lt;ref name="gillon"/&gt; This helped bring about a change in Peter's fortunes.

==Continuing life in America==
At the age of 24, Williamson married the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner and was given a dowry of 200 acres of land close to the frontier of [[Pennsylvania]], where he settled down to life as a farmer.

On the night of 2 October 1754 his farm was attacked by [[Cherokee]] Indians and he was taken prisoner. The house was plundered and burned to the ground. Williamson related that he was forced to march many miles acting as a pack-mule for the Cherokees and that, whilst with them, he witnessed many murders and [[scalping]]s.

After several months he escaped and made his way back to his father-in-law's home, where he learnt that his wife had died in his absence.

He was called before the State Assembly in [[Philadelphia]] to pass on any information he had acquired during his captivity. Whilst there, he enlisted in an army regiment raised to combat in the [[French and Indian War]]. In the following two years he rose to the rank of lieutenant.

==Third capture/return to Scotland==
[[File:French and Indian Cruelty title page.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''French and Indian Cruelty'']]
In a now repeating pattern he was captured by French troops and marched to [[Quebec]]. He was then granted status as an "exchange prisoner" and sent on a ship to [[Plymouth, England|Plymouth in England]] where he arrived in November 1756. Having a damaged left hand from being wounded, he was discharged from the army as unfit and given a small [[gratuity]] of six shillings to help him.

He set off to walk the length of England and Scotland combined back to Aberdeen. Arriving penniless in [[York]] his stories aroused the interest of some "honourable and influential men" who encouraged him to write about his exploits. With their backing he published his account under the title ''French and Indian Cruelty, exemplified in the Life and various Vicissitudes of Fortune of Peter Williamson, who was carried off from Aberdeen in his Infancy and sold as a slave in Pennsylvania''.

A thousand copies of the book were sold, earning Williamson a profit of £30, which allowed him to continue his journey to Scotland in comparative ease.

==Return to Scotland==
As he travelled northwards, Williamson took to dressing as a "[[Red Indian]]" and giving displays of Indian life, e.g. demonstrating war-cries and dancing, to help sell further copies of his book which he carried around with him. In June 1758 he finally returned to Aberdeen, some 15 years after his kidnapping.

While he was selling copies of his book in Aberdeen, the authorities charged Williamson with [[libel]] in relation to his accusations of their involvement in his original kidnapping. Since the same magistrates he was accusing were also judging him, a guilty verdict was perhaps inevitable. Surplus copies of his book were seized and burned publicly at the [[mercat cross]] by the common hangman. Williamson was made to sign a statement stating that his claims were false, fined five shillings and banished from Aberdeen as a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]].

==Edinburgh==
Williamson then headed for [[Edinburgh, Scotland|Edinburgh]] where he settled for the remainder of his life. Here he opened a coffee house under [[Parliament Hall, Edinburgh|Parliament House]] which became a favourite resort of Edinburgh lawyers and their clients.

[[Robert Fergusson]] devoted a verse of his poem ''The Rising of the Session'' to this popular establishment:

&lt;poem&gt;
This vacance [vacation] is a heavy doom
  On Indian Peter's coffee-room
For a' his china pigs are toom [bottles are empty]
  Nor do we see
In wine the soukar biskets soom [sugar biscuits swim]
  As light's a flee&lt;ref&gt;R Chambers, Traditions of Edinburgh, W &amp; R Chambers Ltd., Edinburgh 1947, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Having read his book, some of the lawyers encouraged him to sue the Aberdeen magistrates. The case was heard in the [[Court of Session]] in Edinburgh and the judges found unanimously in Williamson's favour. The [[Provost of Aberdeen]], four [[Baillie|bailies]] and the [[Dean of Guild]] were forced to pay him £100 in compensation.

Emboldened by this success, Williamson decided further to sue Bailie William Fordyce and others, whom he believed were personally responsible for his kidnapping. The case went before James Forbes, Sheriff-Substitute of Aberdeenshire, acting as arbiter. It seems that the defendants wined and dined Forbes generously ahead of his final deliberations and he [[exonerate]]d them. The decree was read out at the mercat cross the next day.

However, the case was referred to the Court of Session in Edinburgh, and after Williamson produced hard evidence of the defendants' involvement, the Court reversed the Sheriff-Substitute's decision in December 1763. Williamson was awarded £200 damages plus 100 [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]]s legal costs.

==Fame and fortune==
Williamson's new-found wealth enabled him to open a tavern in [[Parliament Square, Edinburgh|Parliament Close]] bearing a sign worded, ''Peter Williamson, Vintner From The Other World'', in allusion to his time in North America. A wooden figure of him in [[Lenape|Delaware]] Indian costume stood at the head of the close to advertise its location.

In 1769 Williamson opened a printing shop in the [[Luckenbooths]] between [[St Giles High Kirk]] and the north side of the [[Royal Mile]]. He taught himself the craft of printing using a portable press purchased in London. He then invented his own portable printing press and travelled to exhibitions and fairs to promote his new product. He also invented waterproof ink for stamping linen which withstood both boiling and bleaching.

In 1773 Williamson compiled the first Edinburgh street directory in conjunction with his idea of setting up a regular postal service in the city. This comprised a list of streets and closes with the addresses of lawyers, merchants, officials and other notable gentlemen. Addresses of shops and taverns were also included, thereby not only hugely aiding navigation in the city but creating what is now a very valuable historical source. The Directory cost one shilling and was published regularly with relevant updates until 1796.

In 1776 he launched a weekly magazine, ''The Scots Spy'' or ''Critical Observer'' but this ran only from 8 March until 30 August 1776. It was issued each Friday and contained articles and local gossip. He tried to revive this in 1777 under the title ''The New Scots Spy'' but this second venture ran only from 29 August until 14 November 1777.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB|inline=1|wstitle=Williamson, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1777 he married Jean the daughter of John Wilson, a bookseller in Edinburgh. They divorced in 1788.

The [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in London has a print which appeared in ''The Grand Magazine'' in June 1759 showing Williamson in full "Delaware Indian" dress with tomahawk and scalping knife. The caricaturist [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]] drew him in Indian costume some time around 1768 and this drawing appeared in the preface of later editions of Williamson's autobiography. It also appears as portrait No.128 in Kay's "Original Portraits", a collection of drawings of Edinburgh characters of the time.

==Postal service==
[[File:Peter Williamson's 1784 Penny Post.jpg|thumb|1774 entire wrapper posted in Peter Williamson's postal service with "E. Penny Post Not Paid" circular handstamp in black ink on the reverse]]
[[File:Mercat Cross, High Street, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|The Mercat Cross, Edinburgh (reconstructed 1885)]]
Some time before 1774 Williamson introduced a postal service in Edinburgh. This is evidenced in his Edinburgh Directory of that year, where he draws the public's attention to the fact that "the publisher" (i.e. himself) is willing to dispatch letters and packages up to 3 pounds in weight to any place within one mile of the city's [[Mercat Cross, Edinburgh|mercat cross]], as well as to properties in North and South [[Leith]]. The service was run from his premises in the Luckenbooths every hour on the hour and cost one penny.

Seventeen local shopkeepers spread throughout the city were paid to receive the letters, thus effectively creating the first "post offices". Four uniformed postmen were employed to deliver from the Luckenbooths to the shops. Their hats were emblazoned with the words "Penny Post" and they were numbered 1, 4, 8 and 16 (giving the impression that the business was bigger than it was).

The service was the first regular and continuous postal service in Scotland, and ran under Williamson's control for 30 years. In 1793, it was integrated into the [[General Post Office]] and Williamson received £25 for the goodwill of the business and a pension of 25 shillings per year.

The poet Robert Fergusson again referred to Williamson in ''Codicile to Robert Fergusson's Last Will'':
&lt;poem&gt;
To Williamson, and his resetters
  Dispersing of the burial letters
That they may pass with little cost
  Fleet on the wings of [[Penny Post|penny-post]]
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Death==
{{weasel|date=August 2017}}
In his final years Williamson returned to running a tavern, this time in the [[Lawnmarket]], where he seems to have become an alcoholic. He died in January 1799, probably of [[liver disease]].

He was buried in the [[Old Calton Burial Ground]] in Edinburgh, somewhere just northeast of the [[Political Martyrs' Monument]]. Whilst the grave is unmarked, he is at least commemorated today by tour guides. His obituary in "[[The Scots Magazine]]" appeared soon after and praised Williamson and his various fortunes, good and bad.

==Veracity of Indian captivity narrative==
The veracity of Williamson's captivity story was challenged almost as soon as it was first printed, and the work has always been seen as suspect among professional historians.  In a 1964 article for the quarterly journal ''[[Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies]]'', J. Bennett Nolan qualified Williamson as "one of the greatest liars who ever lived."&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, J. Bennett.  "Peter Williamson in America, a Colonial Odyssey".  ''Pennsylvania History:  A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies'' 31.1 (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

While Bennett's statement may be slightly harsh, recent scholarship suggests that large parts of Williamson's narrative are in fact a fabrication; including possibly his marriage, his age at the time of his first kidnapping from Aberdeen, and most significantly his capture by Native Americans.

While Williamson's tale is "not to be trusted as an account of Indian Captivity," it is an interesting example of the popular literature genre Timothy J. Shannon has called "narratives of unfortunates."  It is also a good example of anti-French propaganda during the [[Seven Years' War]], and like Defoe's ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', sheds light on the colonial construction and representation of native peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, Timothy J.  "King of the Indians: The Hard Fate and Curious Career of Peter Williamson". ''The William and Mary Quarterly'' 66.1 (2009): 3–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments around the world have passed measures to '''phase out incandescent light bulbs''' for general lighting in favor of more energy-efficient lighting alternatives. Phase-out regulations effectively ban the manufacture, importation or sale of [[incandescent light bulb]]s for general lighting.

Objections to replacement of incandescent lamps for general lighting mainly include the higher purchasing cost of alternative light bulbs. To mitigate the effects of these concerns, various programs have been put in place ranging from subsidies for lamps to improved standards for measurement of performance and for labelling products. Manufacturers develop fluorescent lamps with reduced mercury content compared to original designs, and recycling programs are intended to prevent mercury release. New lamp types offer improved starting characteristics, and dimmable types are available.

== Alternatives to incandescent bulbs ==
The light from an incandescent source is similar in character to that from a [[Planckian locus|Planckian "black body"]] in spectral distribution, that is, the bulb, as the filament heats up, produces light from wavelengths throughout the visible spectrum. Alternative light sources use phosphors or combinations of mono-chromatic LEDs (red, blue, green) to produce "white" light, giving significantly irregular spectral distributions which can result in color casts in photography and differences of color matching when compared to incandescent light or daylight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gelighting.com/na/business_lighting/education_resources/learn_about_light/distribution_curves.htm |work=GE Lighting |title=Spectral Power Distribution Curves |accessdate=8 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626153615/http://www.gelighting.com/na/business_lighting/education_resources/learn_about_light/distribution_curves.htm |archivedate=26 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

[[Halogen lamp]]s are a type of incandescent lamp with improved efficiency over regular incandescent lamps. Though not as energy efficient as other alternatives, they are up to 40 percent more efficient than standard incandescent lamps designed for a 2000-hour life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Donald R.|editor-last=Wulfinghoff|title=Energy Efficiency Manual|publisher=Energy Institute Press|year=1999|isbn=0-9657926-7-6|page=1032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on size, voltage, and designed life, small low-voltage halogen lamps can have 70% higher efficacy than large line-voltage lamps. The high operating temperature of halogen bulbs may be a safety hazard in some applications.

A [[compact fluorescent lamp]] (CFL) uses a fluorescent lamp tube which is curved or folded to fit into the space of an incandescent bulb and contains a compact electronic ballast in the base of the lamp. Compared to general-service incandescent lamps giving the same amount of visible light, CFLs use one-fifth to one-third the electric power, and may last eight to fifteen times longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Light Bulbs for Consumers| work=[[Energy Star]] | accessdate= 8 January 2014 | url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=cfls.pr_cfls}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Newer [[phosphor]] formulations have improved the perceived color, with "soft white" CFLs judged subjectively similar to standard incandescent lamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Best Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs: PM Lab Test |last=Masamitsu |first=Emily |date=May 2007 |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |accessdate=15 May 2007 |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home_journal/home_improvement/4215199.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426184034/http://www.popularmechanics.com/home_journal/home_improvement/4215199.html |archivedate=26 April 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Objections more specifically relating to compact fluorescent light bulbs include the different quality of light produced by phosphor-based lamps compared to incandescent lamps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/business/energy-environment/06bulbs.html | work= [[The New York Times]] | title=Incandescent Bulbs Return to the Cutting Edge | date=6 July 2009|accessdate=8 January 2014|last=Broydo Vestel|first=Leora}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that compact fluorescent light bulbs contain small amounts of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], a potent neurotoxin, which is especially dangerous to children and pregnant women, and made more serious by the confined area mercury would be dispersed in the event of a breakage indoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7431198 | work= [[National Public Radio]] | title=CFL Bulbs Have One Hitch: Toxic Mercury| date=15 February 2007|last=Shogren|first=Elizabeth|accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental concerns about mercury contamination from CFLs have been raised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tinsley|first=Anna M.|title=Barton takes dim view of federal light bulb policy|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/03/21/2939246/barton-takes-dim-view-of-federal.html|publisher=Star-Telegram|accessdate=8 January 2014|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Heated' debate over incandescent bulbs|url=http://greenenergybc.wordpress.com/2011/01/28/%E2%80%98heated%E2%80%99-debate-over-incandescent-bulbs/|work=The official blog of B.C.

Thus, use of energy-efficient bulbs can actually reduce the amount of mercury released into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/promotions/change_light/downloads/Fact_Sheet_Mercury.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s start poorly when very cold, and most types cannot be dimmed.

In 2008, the Irish government announced a phase-out of the sale of any light bulbs with a luminous efficiency of less than 16 lumens per watt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Atmosphere/ClimateChange/LightBulbsPublicConsultation/LightBulbsFAQs/ |title=Light Bulbs FAQs |publisher=[[Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government]] |accessdate=1 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208063654/http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Atmosphere/ClimateChange/LightBulbsPublicConsultation/LightBulbsFAQs/ |archivedate=8 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, all [[European Union member state|member states of the EU]] agreed to a progressive phase-out of incandescent light bulbs by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/1909&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en|title=Member States approve the phasing-out of incandescent bulbs by 2012|date=8 December 2008|work=EUROPA|publisher=European Union|accessdate= 7 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The initial Europe wide ban only applied to general-purpose, non-directional incandescent bulbs, so did not affect any bulbs with reflective surfaces (e.g. [[spotlight (lighting)|spotlight]]s and [[halogen down lighter]]s) or special purpose bulbs including those used in devices such as household appliances, traffic lights, infrared lamps and [[automotive lighting]]. The sale of the most inefficient bulbs was phased out. The first types to go were non-clear (frosted) bulbs, which were taken off the market in September 2009. Also from September 2009 clear bulbs over 100 W were made of more efficient types. This limit was moved down to lower wattages, and the efficiency levels raised by the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/efficiency/ecodesign/doc/committee/2008_12_08_technical_briefing_household_lamps.pdf|title=Phasing out incandescent bulbs in the EU – Technical briefing|date=8 December 2008|work=EUROPA|publisher=European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, some manufacturers and retailers have found a loophole in the new rules so that some incandescents are still available, marketed as "rough-service" or "shock-resistant" bulbs for industrial use only. Such bulbs are widely available in [[market (place)|market]]s and [[hardware store]]s at much lower cost than official alternatives such as CFLs. They also offer improved safety for users by having a faster reaction time,{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} and so users can see [[hazards]] when entering a room for example.&lt;ref name="tel"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/9498092/Retailers-avoid-ban-on-traditional-light-bulbs.html|title= Retailers avoid ban on traditional light bulbs|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=8 January 2014|date=26 August 2012|last=Malnick|first=Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since first bans were introduced however, prices of these bulbs have risen by 20–25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.pl/gospodarka/artykul/wietlowki-energooszczdne-nieuzasadnione-podwyki-cen-002884|title=Świetlówki energooszczędne: Nieuzasadnione podwyżki cen?|language=Polish, German|date=2 September 2010|accessdate=8 January 2014|work=euractiv.pl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108103113/http://www.euractiv.pl/gospodarka/artykul/wietlowki-energooszczdne-nieuzasadnione-podwyki-cen-002884|archive-date=8 January 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German importer simply reclassified the lamps as "mini heaters"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/15/us-germany-heatballs-idUSTRE69E3FS20101015|date=15 October 2010|accessdate=8 January 2014|title=German "heatball" wheeze outwits EU light bulb ban|work=[[Reuters]]|place=Berlin|first=Michelle|last=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; branded "[[Heatball]]s", but that was banned shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/umwelt/article106632745/Verkauf-von-Gluehbirnen-als-Miniheizung-verboten.html|title=Gerichtsurteil: Verkauf von Glühbirnen als "Miniheizung" verboten|first=DIE|last=WELT|date=19 June 2012|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2018|via=www.welt.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU set a target of 2016 to phase out [[halogen bulbs]] with two directives  EC 244/2009 and EC 1194/2012. The phase out of the first directive EC 244/2009 originally planned for September 2016 was delayed until September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/20/eu-delays-ban-on-halogen-bulbs|title=EU delays ban on halogen bulbs|date=20 April 2015|publisher=The Guardian|last1=Ala-Kurikka|first1=Susanna|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second directive EC 1194/2012 was upheld, as part of a review of the lighting directive four criteria needed to be assessed before a phase-out could be confirmed. Issues of ‘affordability’ were under scrutiny, as well as performance, equivalence to existing models and compatibility. The EU confirmed that there was absolutely no reason to delay the ban on mains voltage directional halogen lamps, as all four of the criteria had been sufficiently met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eceee.org/all-news/news/news-2015/2015-09-15a|title=EC confirms: Mains-voltage directional halogen lamps to be phased out September 2016|last=|first=|date=15 September 2015|work=|access-date=11 August 2016|via=http://www.eceee.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The directive EC 1194/2012 relates to mains voltage directional halogen lamps and means many common halogen reflector lamps such as D rated GU10's are affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voltimum.co.uk/articles/megaman-halogen-ban-explained|title=MEGAMAN – The Halogen Ban Explained|website=Voltimum UK|access-date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montenegro banned incandescent bulbs over 100W from 1 July 2018, part of a phased ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://serbia-energy.eu/single-esiasee/?postid=9885|work=Serbia Energy|title=Phased ban of incandescent bulbs starts July 1 this year in Montenegro|date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Norway ====
Norway has implemented the EU directive for the phase-out of incandescent light bulbs and has followed the same phase out route as the EU.  There was a half-year delay in implementing the directive compared to the EU, but the phase out occurred at the same time since the affected light bulbs were no longer available from European sources.

==== Russia ====
Russia is phasing out incandescent light bulbs. The production of lamps of 100 watt and more is banned. There are also discussions to ban light bulbs of 50 watts and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vestnikkavkaza.net/news/50-W-incandescent-bulbs-to-be-banned-in-Russia.html|title=50 W incandescent bulbs to be banned in Russia - Vestnik Kavkaza|website=vestnikkavkaza.net|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Switzerland ====
Switzerland banned the sale of all light bulbs of the [[European Union energy label|Energy Efficiency Class]] F and G, which affects a few types of incandescent light bulbs. Most normal light bulbs are of Energy Efficiency Class E, and the Swiss regulation has exceptions for various kinds of special-purpose and decorative bulbs.&lt;ref name="tagesanzeiger.ch"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.embag.ch/downloads/pressemitteilung31.10.2008dt.pdf|title=Vorerst noch kein generelles Glühlampenverbot in der Schweiz – Energieeffiziente Lampen machen Umstieg schon heute möglich ("For now, still no general ban on incandescent lamps in Switzerland – Energy-efficient lamps make migration possible today")|date=31 October 2008|language=German|accessdate=8 January 2014|publisher=[[Philips]] Switzerland|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203131321/http://www.embag.ch/downloads/pressemitteilung31.10.2008dt.pdf|archive-date=3 December 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with EU rules, Switzerland banned the import and manufacture of halogen light bulbs in September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lenews.ch/2018/09/06/halogen-light-bulbs-to-be-banned-in-switzerland/|work=Le News|title=Halogen light bulbs to be banned in Switzerland|date=6 September 2018|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
The provincial government of [[Nova Scotia]] stated in February 2007 that it would like to move towards preventing the sale of incandescent light bulbs in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2007/02/28/ns-lightbulb.html?ref=rss |title=Nova Scotia ponders light-bulb switch |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=28 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911214952/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2007/02/28/ns-lightbulb.html?ref=rss |archivedate=11 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, [[Ontario]]'s [[Ministry of Energy (Ontario)|Minister of Energy]] [[Dwight Duncan]] announced the provincial government's intention to ban the sale of incandescent light bulbs by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2007/04/18/ontario-lightbulb-ban.html |title=Ontario turns out the lights on inefficient bulbs |date= 18 April 2007 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115211248/http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2007/04/18/ontario-lightbulb-ban.html |archivedate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in April, the federal government announced that it would ban the sale of inefficient incandescent light bulbs nationwide by 2012 as part of a plan to cut down on emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2529253520070425|accessdate= 14 July 2010| publisher = [[Reuters]] |date=25 April 2007 | title=Canada to ban incandescent light bulbs by 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 Nov 2011, the federal government approved a proposal to delay new energy efficiency standards for light bulbs until 1 January 2014, when it will become illegal to import inefficient incandescent lighting across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p1/2011/2011-04-16/html/reg1-eng.html|title=Regulations Amending the Energy Efficiency Regulations|journal=[[Canada Gazette]]|date=16 April 2011|accessdate=8 January 2014|volume=145|issue=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2011/2011-11-09/html/sor-dors228-eng.html Regulations Amending the Energy Efficiency Regulations], Canada Gazette&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, Ontario Energy Minister [Chris Bentley] confirmed that Ontario is scrapping the five-year-old plan "to avoid confusing consumers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1105206--ontario-backs-down-on-incandescent-bulb-ban | work=[[Toronto Star]] | first=Rob | last=Ferguson | title=Ontario backs down on incandescent bulb ban | date=21 December 2011 | accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Energy Star]] program, in which [[Natural Resources Canada]] is a partner, in March 2008 established rules for labelling lamps that meet a set of standards for efficiency, starting time, life expectancy, colour, and consistency of performance. The intent of the program is to reduce consumer concerns about efficient light bulbs due to variable quality of products.&lt;ref name="energystar.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/prod_development/revisions/downloads/cfls/Criteria_CFLs_V4.pdf|title=Energy Star Program Requirements for CFLS Partner Commitments|edition=4th|date=7 March 2008|accessdate=8 January 2014|publisher=[[Energy Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those CFLs with a recent Energy Star certification start in less than one second and do not flicker.

In January 2011, the province of British Columbia banned retailers from ordering 75- or 100-watt incandescent bulbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2011/01/25/consumer-incandescent-bulbs578.html|date=25 January 2011 | title=Consumers hoard light bulbs amid B.C. ban | publisher = [[CBC News]] | accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian federal government banned the import and sale of 75- and 100-watt incandescent bulbs, effective 1 January 2014. On 1 January 2015, 40- and 60-watt bulbs were also banned. Retailers will be allowed to sell their existing inventories imported before the bans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/12/13/ban-on-inefficient-light-bulbs-arriving-watered-down-seven-years-after-federal-government-announcement/ |date=13 December 2013 | title=Ban on inefficient light bulbs arriving – watered down – seven years after federal government announcement | publisher = [[National Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Individual state efforts =====
California will phase out the use of incandescent bulbs by 2018. The bill aims to establish a minimum standard of twenty-five lumens per watt by 2013 and sixty lumens per watt by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cawrecycles.org/issues/current_legislation/ab1109_07|title=AB 1109 (Huffman) Lighting Efficiency &amp; Toxics Reduction Act|accessdate=19 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007134940/http://www.cawrecycles.org/issues/current_legislation/ab1109_07|archive-date=7 October 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1101-1150/ab_1109_bill_20070223_introduced.html "AB 1109 Assembly Bill – Introduced"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Connecticut]] legislation was proposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conntact.com/article_page.lasso?id=40692 "A Light Bulb Went Off over Their Heads"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016215443/http://conntact.com/article_page.lasso?id=40692 |date=16 October 2007 }}.

A bill was introduced in [[New Jersey]] in 2007 that calls for the state to eliminate incandescent bulbs in government buildings over the next three years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2007-02-09-edison-bulb-ban_x.htm?csp=34 "Edison's light bulb could be endangered"]. [[Associated Press]] (via ''[[USA Today]]''). 9 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Utah energy efficiency standards for government buildings were passed in 1999 that, in practice, require the adoption of energy efficient technology, including LEDs, as the technology becomes available. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title63A/Chapter5/63A-5-S701.html|title=Title 63A Utah Administrative Services Code|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utah has also undertaken a number of LED based lighting projects to regain efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dfcm.utah.gov/images/bb/2011_Energy_Efficiency_Projects.pdf],|title=[[Utah Department of Administrative Services]|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Federal legislation =====
In December 2007, the federal government enacted the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]], which contains legislation to make incandescent light bulbs more efficient by setting maximum wattage requirements for all general service [[incandescent light bulb]]s producing 310–2600 [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]] of light.  Light bulbs outside of this range are exempt from the restrictions. Also exempt are several classes of specialty lights, including appliance lamps, [[Trouble light|rough service bulbs]], [[3-way lamp|3-way]], colored lamps, stage lighting, plant lights, candelabra lights under 60 watts, outdoor post lights less than 100 watts, nightlights and shatter resistant bulbs.  This effectively banned the manufacturing or importing of most incandescent bulbs of that time.&lt;ref name="TLG1"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.00006: THOMAS Record of Clean Energy Act].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bulbsdepot.com/blog/lighting-exemptions.html|title=Lighting Exemptions from the Energy Independence Act|accessdate= 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The timeline for these standards was to start in January 2012. By 2020, a second tier of restrictions would become effective, which require all general-purpose bulbs to produce at least 45 lumens per watt (similar to current CFLs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://energystar.supportportal.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=23018 ENERGY STAR Frequently Asked Questions], EnergyStar Customer Support.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Energy Star]] program in March 2008 established rules for labeling lamps that meet a set of standards for efficiency, starting time, life expectancy, color, and consistency of performance. The intent of the program is to reduce consumer concerns about efficient light bulbs due to variable quality of products.&lt;ref name="energystar.gov"/&gt; Those CFLs with a recent Energy Star certification start in less than one second and do not flicker.

In 2011, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] House members introduced a [[U.S. Lighting Energy Policy#Better Use of Light Bulbs Act|Better Use of Light Bulbs Act]] or BULB Act (H.R. 91), which would have repealed Subtitle B of Title III of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsc.jordan.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=219203|title=RSC Members Lead Effort to Repeal Light Bulb Ban|publisher=Republican Study Committee|date=6 January 2011|accessdate=14 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603065404/http://rsc.jordan.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=219203|archive-date=3 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; H.R. 2417 failed to pass in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-2417|title=H.R. 2417: Better Use of Light Bulbs Act|publisher=[[GovTrack]] |accessdate= 14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 2011, the U.S. House passed the final [[2012 United States federal budget|2012 budget]] legislation, which effectively delayed the implementation until October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_772480.html|title=Congress flips dimmer switch on light bulb law|work=[[Trib Live]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=17 December 2011|accessdate=9 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218031349/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_772480.html|archive-date=18 February 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the spending bill proposed by the House effectively blocked the energy efficiency standards in the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]], which would have made incandescent light bulbs obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/10/politics/policy-riders-spending-bill/|title=Here's what's tucked in the spending bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, incandescent bulbs are set to be banned in the United States in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/12/20/hey-california-say-farewell-to-your-traditional-incandescent-light-bulbs/|title=Hey California, say farewell to your traditional incandescent light bulbs|date=20 December 2017|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Australia ====
In February 2007, Australia enacted a law that will, in effect, by legislating efficiency standards, disallow most sales of incandescent light bulbs by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.business2.com/greenwombat/2007/02/australia_bans_.html|title= Australia Bans Traditional Light Bulbs to Combat Global Warming|publisher=green wombat blog|date=20 February 2007|accessdate= 31 December 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211225147/http://blogs.business2.com/greenwombat/2007/02/australia_bans_.html  |archivedate = 11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Federal Government announced minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) for lighting products. The new minimum standard efficiency level is [[Luminous efficacy#Examples 2|15 lumens per watt (lm/W)]]. From November 2008, no non-compliant lighting (including some incandescent globes) were imported into Australia, and from November 2009, the retail sale of non-compliant lighting was banned.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government: Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts [http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/energyefficiency/lighting/faq-phaseout.html "Phase-out of inefficient incandescent light bulbs"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901123102/http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/energyefficiency/lighting/faq-phaseout.html |date=1 September 2009 }}.

Incandescent light bulbs that meet the new standards, for example high-efficiency halogen bulbs, continue to be available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://www.energyrating.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/2008-ris-phaseout.pdf&amp;embedded=true "Consultation Regulatory Impact Statement:  Proposal to Phase-Out Inefficient Incandescent Lighting Products"].  Australian Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that [[greenhouse gas]] emissions will be cut by 800,000 tonnes (Australia's current emission total is 564.7 million tonnes), a saving of approximately 0.14%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/light-bulbs-ban-to-slash-emissions/2007/02/19/1171733685061.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Light bulbs ban to slash emissions | date=20 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost ===
The initial cost of CFLs and LEDs are higher than that of incandescent light bulbs. Typically this extra cost is repaid in the long-term, as both use less energy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gelighting.com/na/business_lighting/faqs/cfl.htm#10|title=FAQ - Commercial Lighting Information|work=GE Lighting North America|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329191437/http://www.gelighting.com/na/business_lighting/faqs/cfl.htm#10|archivedate=29 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have longer operating lives than incandescent bulbs. When bulbs are used infrequently, such as in little-used closets and attics, it may take a long time to compensate for the higher initial cost of the bulb.&lt;ref name="revolt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/business/2008/01/30/light-bulb-revolt-incandescent-fans-rise-up.html|title=Light-Bulb Revolt: Incandescent Fans Rise Up|author=Marianne Lavelle|work=US News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Heating and cooling ====
{{Main article|Compact fluorescent lamp#Heating and cooling}}
The overall energy savings from changing to more efficient lighting depends on the climate. In warm climates, efficient lighting has the additional energy-saving effect of reducing the amount of cooling required. In cold climates increased heating energy demand may offset some of the lighting energy saved with efficient lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2009/03/04/mb-light-bulbs.html | publisher = [[CBC News]] | title=Efficient lighting equals higher heat bills: study | date=4 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A report published in January 2008 found that in [[Los Angeles]], where incandescent lighting results in increased air conditioning, electricity savings would pay for the initial cost of CFLs four times faster than in [[Vancouver]], where incandescent lighting contributes to space heating.&lt;ref name=cmhc&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cmhc.ca/odpub/pdf/65830.pdf |title=Benchmarking Home Energy Savings from Energy-Efficient Lighting |date=January 2008 |series=Technical Series 08-101 |publisher=Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all climates, there is a net cost saving from changing to compact fluorescent lighting.&lt;ref name=cmhc/&gt; The cost of CFL and LED bulbs has declined greatly since 2008, which shortens the time needed to pay off their initial cost.

While the excessive heat produced by incandescent light bulbs is frequently seen as a drawback, in certain applications it is seen as an advantage. For example, automotive applications in cold climates benefit from the radiated heat as it melts potentially visually-obstructive snow and ice on warning lights and signs. The heat is also used to melt the wax inside [[lava lamp]]s.

=== Dimmers ===
Some CFLs may not be compatible with existing dimming circuits such as those using [[TRIAC]]s, although more dimmable CFLs are expected to become available as the phase-outs continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compact fluorescent light bulbs|url=http://www.seattle.gov/light/conserve/resident/cv5_lw2.htm|work=The Seattle City Light Web Team|publisher=City of Seattle|accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mains voltage [[halogen bulb]]s provide a somewhat more efficient dimmable alternative to common incandescent bulbs and are readily available,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/energyefficiency/lighting/faq-alternatives.html#docfls Do compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) work with dimmer switches?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604095541/http://environment.gov.au/settlements/energyefficiency/lighting/faq-alternatives.html#docfls |date=4 June 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; although they too will be phased out in the EU from September 2018.

Dimmable LED lamps are available from several vendors, although not all LED lamps are compatible with dimmers and their color temperature may not lower, as it does with incandescents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3433">'''Philip F. Wenz''' (born April 13, 1873) was a [[carpenter]] and [[machinist]] who served three terms (1927–1932) as a [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] member of the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] from the 7th [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] district (7th [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] of the City of Milwaukee).&lt;ref&gt;[http://legis.state.wi.us/LRB/pubs/ib/99ib1.pdf Cannon, A. Peter, ed. ''Members of the Wisconsin Legislature: 1848 – 1999''. State of Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau Informational Bulletin 99-1, September 1999; p. 121] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209014416/http://legis.state.wi.us/LRB/pubs/ib/99ib1.pdf |date=2006-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Wenz was born in Milwaukee on April 13, 1873. He received a [[State school|public school]] education in the [[grade schools]] of Milwaukee and became an apprentice carpenter at the age of 16. Later he became a machinist, but preferred outdoor employment and again returned to carpentry. He sold [[insurance]] and [[stocks]] for five years "but found this business to vary considerably in seasons" and returned to carpentry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1927 Holmes, Fred L., ed. ''The Wisconsin blue book, 1927'' Madison: Democrat Printing Company, State Printer, 1927; p. 710]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political office ==
He was working as a carpenter when he was first elected to the Assembly in November 1926 (succeeding fellow Socialist [and machinist] [[Alex C. Ruffing]]) receiving 1,509 votes to 1,087 for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Henry Blackburn. He was assigned to the [[standing committee]] on [[municipalities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1927 Holmes, Fred L., ed. ''The Wisconsin blue book, 1927'' Madison: Democrat Printing Company, State Printer, 1927; pp. 587, 653]&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was re-elected in 1928, with 1801 votes to 815 for Ella Goess.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1929 Anderson, William J.; Anderson, William A., eds. ''The Wisconsin blue book, 1929'' Madison: Democrat Printing Company, State Printer, 1929; pp. 513]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1930 he was unopposed in the [[primary election]], and was re-elected in the general election, with 1443 votes to 1103 for former Assemblyman [[Charles Meising]] (a Republican), 314 for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Fred Stich, and 34 for Jack Schwab. He retained his seat on the municipalities committee, but was additionally assigned to the Committee on [[Commerce]] and [[Manufactures]], and to the [[joint committee]] on University and Capitol [[heating plant|Heating Plants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1931 Kelly, Alice, ed. ''The Wisconsin blue book, 1931'' Madison: Democrat Printing Company, State Printer, 1931; pp. 189-91, 572, 577]&lt;/ref&gt; 

He did not run for re-election in 1932, and was succeeded by fellow Socialist [[Arthur Koegel]].

The '''Public Defender Service''' '''(PDS)''' for the [[District of Columbia]] provides legal defense to individuals on a court-appointed basis for criminal (at the trial and appellate levels) and delinquency cases indigent adult and juvenile defendants/ respondents. Its Mental Health Division provides representation to persons facing involuntary [[civil commitment]] based on allegations that the person is a danger to self or others as a result of mental illness. Its parole division represents parolees charged with violating parole and facing revocation before the [[United States Parole Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Defender Service|url=http://www.lawhelp.org/dc/organization/public-defender-service?ref=KaFxy|website=lawhelp.org|publisher=LawHelp.org|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; PDS also provides other legal-related services in DC.

==History==
The organization began in 1960 when the [[United States Congress]] established the Legal Aid Agency for the District of Columbia (LAA) under the District of Columbia Legal Aid Agency Act for the purpose of representing people who could not afford an attorney in criminal, juvenile, and mental health proceedings. The Bar Association of the District of Columbia's Board of Directors devoted itself in 1955 to promoting the creation of a  legal aid entity that would provide "competent and conscientious legal assistance" in a manner that would be "an inspiring example for other communities," issuing its "Report of the Commission on Legal Aid of the Bar Association of the District of Columbia" in 1958. Then-Chief Judge of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] [[E. Barrett Prettyman]], using the
report, led a group of lawyers who went to the [[United States Congress]] and advocated for the establishment of an office that would focus on more serious criminal cases, juvenile delinquency cases, and mental health cases. LAA would break with past practice by being entirely government-funded and would be completely independent from the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government.&lt;ref name=AY/&gt;

In 1963, the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' recognized the constitutional [[right to counsel]] in criminal cases for people unable to afford their own attorneys in [[felony]] matters. Shortly thereafter, LAA leadership crafted the 1970 statute that established the current District of Columbia Public Defender Service (PDS), broadened the mandate to include the Appointment of Counsel Program (now the Defender Services Office) and the Offender Rehabilitation Division (now the Office of Rehabilitation and Development), and secured the apolitical role of the PDS Board of Trustees. PDS's mandate was to provide representation for up to sixty percent of the persons who are annually determined to be financially unable to obtain adequate representation. Those not represented by PDS are represented by private attorneys compensated through Criminal Justice Act (CJA). In 1974, the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] (DOJ) labelled PDS as an "exemplary project" and model for other jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=AY/&gt;

PDS has been innovative in the delivery of legal services with the implementation of PDS's Correctional Services Program (services now provided by the Parole Division and the Institutional Services Program) in 1974, the Volunteer and Intern Program (now the Criminal Law Internship Program) in 1977, the Juvenile Services Program in 1982, a special litigation counsel position (now the Special Litigation Division and the Special Counsel to the Director for Legislative Affairs) in 1988/1989, the Community Defender Program (now the Community Defender Division) in 2000, and the Civil Legal Services Unit (now the Civil Legal Services Division) in 2001. PDS also established its Forensic Practice Group (FPG) in 2001 in response to its concerns that no current scientific method ensures the accuracy and reliability of many of the tools used to investigate and prove criminal cases and that across the nation, inconsistent practices are applied regarding such critical matters as who collects the evidence, how it is processed, and how it is interpreted.&lt;ref name=AY&gt;{{cite web|title=PDS Annual Report - FY 2012|url=http://www.pdsdc.org/Resources/Publication/FY%202012%20Annual%20Report.pdf|website=pdsdc.org|publisher=PDSDC|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

===Trial Division===
Attorneys in the Trial Division represent adults in criminal proceedings in the [[District of Columbia Superior Court]] and children in [[juvenile delinquency]] matters. Attorneys are assigned to specific levels of cases based on experience and performance. Some attorneys in the Trial Division handle cases involving [[DNA evidence]], [[expert testimony]], multiple-count [[indictments]], and novel or complex legal matters. PDS attorneys provide representation in the majority of the most serious adult felony cases filed in [[D.C. Superior Court]] each year.&lt;ref name=trial&gt;{{cite web|title=The Trial Division|url=http://www.pdsdc.org/PDS/TrialDivision.aspx|website=pdsdc.org|publisher=PDSDC|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appellate Division===
Attorneys in the Appellate Division handle the appellate litigation generated in PDS cases, provide legal advice to Criminal Justice Act attorneys who require assistance in appellate matters, and respond to requests from the [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals]] for briefs in non-PDS cases involving novel or complex legal issues. Another important function of the Appellate Division is to provide a wide range of technical assistance and training to other PDS divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appellate Division|url=http://www.pdsdc.org/PDS/AppellateDivision.aspx|website=pdsdc.org|publisher=PDSDC|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental Health Division===
Attorneys in the Mental Health Division (MHD) handle involuntary [[civil commitment]] cases that arise in [[DC Superior Court]]. PDS is initially appointed when a person is detained in a [[mental hospital]] upon allegations that the person is a danger to self or others as a result of [[mental illness]]. MHD lawyers also represent persons in post-commitment proceedings, including commitment reviews and [[outpatient]] revocation hearings, as well as in involuntary commitment proceedings of persons found incompetent to stand trial because of mental illness or [[mental retardation]], and in matters relating to persons found [[not guilty by reason of insanity]] in DC Superior Court or [[United States District Court]] cases. The lawyers in this division also provide information to the [[Council of the District of Columbia]] on proposed [[mental health]] and mental retardation legislation, conduct training sessions on the rights of mentally ill persons involved in civil commitment actions, and provide legal assistance to Criminal Justice Act lawyers appointed by the court to handle involuntary civil commitment cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental Health Division|url=http://www.pdsdc.org/PDS/MentalHealthDivision.aspx|website=pdsdc.org|publisher=PDSDC|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Litigation Division===
The Special Litigation Division handles a wide variety of litigation related to the constitutional rights of PDS clients and reforming systemic [[criminal justice system]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Litigation Division|url=http://www.pdsdc.org/PDS/SpecialLitigationDivision.aspx|website=pdsdc.org|publisher=PDSDC|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parole Division===
The Parole Division provides representation to DC Code offenders facing revocation before the [[United States Parole Commission]] and their appeals before the National Appeals Board. In addition, this division provides legal assistance to DC inmates housed throughout the country in [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] facilities who write letters requesting counseling regarding parole eligibility matters and other related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parole Division|url=http://www.pdsdc.org/PDS/ParoleDivision.aspx|website=pdsdc.org|publisher=PDSDC|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community Defender Division===
The Community Defender Division provides services through three programs: 1) the Juvenile Services Program represents children at institutional disciplinary hearings at the [[District of Columbia]]'s youth detention centers and works with community organizations to develop reentry programs that address the special needs of children; 2) the Institutional Services Program serves as the PDS liaison to individuals convicted of DC Code offenses and held in [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] facilities, to provide information to assist these individuals and monitor their conditions of [[incarceration]]; and 3) the Community Reentry Program responds to the legal and social services needs of newly released individuals, assisting them in making a successful transition back into the community; the program gives special consideration to returning individuals who are not served by the [[Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Defender Division|url=http://www.pdsdc.org/PDS/CommunityDefenderDivision.aspx|website=pdsdc.org|publisher=PDSDC|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil Legal Services Division===
The Civil Legal Services Division (CLS) provides services addressing issues facing children in the juvenile delinquency system. CLS has a team of special education attorneys who are experts in advocacy under the federal [[Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act]] (IDEA). In addition, CLS addresses other rehabilitative needs of these children and of adult clients by providing representation in civil matters arising out of their criminal charges — public benefits entitlement, housing, child support, and health care services. CLS also provides consultation for attorneys with clients in the criminal justice system who face immigration consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Legal Services Division|url=http://www.pdsdc.org/PDS/CivilLegalServices.aspx|website=pdsdc.org|publisher=PDSDC|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations Division===
The Investigations Division is composed of rigorously-trained, professional investigators who are in-house PDS staff members.  Staff investigators provide support to the Trial, Appellate, Parole, Mental Health, Civil Legal Services, Community Defender and Office of Rehabilitation and Development divisions.  Investigators assist PDS attorneys at all stages of a case beginning the day the case arrives to the agency.  PDS investigators visit crime scenes, locate and interview witnesses, contribute to the development of defense theories, collect and analyze evidence, records and  discovery materials and testify in court in relation to their investigations.  As the PDS Criminal Law Internship Program falls under the purview of the Investigations Division, participating interns work closely with staff investigators.  The Investigations Division is responsible for the provision of ongoing, accredited, external training to many investigators working in the District of Columbia in connection to the Criminal Justice Act.  Staff investigators also provide additional external training at the local and national level, notably for the National Defense Investigator Association at its annual conferences.

==Current legislation==
The [[District of Columbia Courts, Public Defender Service, and Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency Act of 2014]] (H.R. 4185) is a bill that would make changes to the District of Columbia Official Code that governs the D.C. Courts system.

In [[insurance]] [[law]], a '''QC clause''' is a clause in an [[insurance policy]] (usually but not exclusively a professional indemnity insurance policy) that provides that an action against the insured is not to be contested unless a [[Queen's Counsel]] (or QC) advises that the defence has a reasonable prospect of success.  The principal reason for such clauses is to minimise conflict between the insured and the insurer.  The insurer will often wish to settle claims as quickly and cheaply as possible, but the insured may be concerned that paying on a claim implies [[negligence]] which will damage their professional reputation, and want to contest the claim regardless.  Professional indemnity policies commonly provide that the insurer will pay the legal costs of the defence.  It is sometimes suggested that the clause is also designed to protect the public from the unjustified contesting of claims which have no real defence, but this may represent a charitable view of the way insurance companies conduct claims.

Conflicts between the insurer and insured can put a [[solicitor]] who represents both in an invidious position, particularly where the solicitor has received confidential information from one party, and may result in multiplicity of legal representation.  In practice however, there is an enormous reluctance to invoke such clauses, partly because of the expense of instructing Queen's Counsel to advise, and partly because of the insurer's need to maintain good relations with the insured.

Although still called QC clauses, such clauses often provide that the advice of a [[junior barrister]] of a certain seniority may be taken.

Some general liability policies contain a converse version the traditional QC clause; viz., that the insurer does not need to pay out on a claim against the insured ''unless'' a Queen's Counsel advises that there is no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the claim.

QC clauses were considered judicially by [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Lord Devlin]] (in relation to another issue) in ''West Wake Price &amp; Co v Ching'' [1956] 3 All ER 821.

'''Quasi-tort''' is a legal term that is sometimes used to describe unusual [[tort]] actions, on the basis of a [[legal doctrine]] that some legal duty exists which cannot be classified strictly as negligence in a personal duty resulting in a [[tort]] nor as a [[contract]]ual duty resulting in a [[breach of contract]], but rather some other kind of duty recognizable by the [[law]]. It has been used, for example, to describe a tort for [[strict liability]] arising out of [[product liability]], although this is typically simply called a 'tort'.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Gilmore G. (1970). [http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/uclr38&amp;section=13 Products liability: a commentary]. ''University of Chicago Law Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is not to be found in most legal dictionaries, it has been used by some scholars such as Sri Lankan Lakshman Marasinghe. Lakshman proposes that the doctrine provides legal relief that falls outside tort or contract, but with some of the characteristics of tort or contract, as can be found in restitution (including unjust enrichment),&lt;ref&gt;''Pavey &amp; Matthews Property v Paul'' (1987) 162 CLR 221&lt;/ref&gt; [[Equity (law)|equity]] (including unconscionable conduct&lt;ref&gt;''Commercial Bank of Australia Limited v Amadio'' (1983) 151 CLR 447&lt;/ref&gt;), beneficiaries under a trust of the benefit of a promise, people protected by the valid assignment of promise, [[fiduciary duty]], and contracts of insurance.&lt;ref&gt;''Trident General Insurance Co Ltd v. McNiece Bros Pty Ltd'' (1988) 165 CLR 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a third type of civil wrong==
In ''Tort Theory'', [[Lakshman Marasinghe]] posits that ''[[quasi-delict]]'', a doctrine in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, exists as well in common law.&lt;ref name=Marasinghe&gt;Lakshman Marasinghe, "Towards Quasi-Tort in the Common Law?", in Kenneth D.

Retrieved November 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Marasinghe thus argues against [[Viscount Haldane]]'s ''[[dictum]]'' in ''[[Sinclair v Brougham]]'', that the only common law civil [[Cause of action|causes of action]] are, by definition, contract and tort.&lt;ref name=Marasinghe /&gt;

[[Brooklyn Law School]]'s [[law review]] had an article with a similar argument, "Contractor Duty to Third Parties Not in Privity: A Quasi-Tort Solution to the Vexing Problem of Victims of Nonfeasance."&lt;ref&gt;Note, "Contractor Duty to Third Parties Not in Privity: A Quasi-Tort Solution to the Vexing Problem of Victims of Nonfeasance."

==As a violation of a statutory or regulatory scheme==
Tort law has been modified by statute to expand protection, and limit liability. Many tort law statutes have their origins in common law, and are interpreted through common law. These include [[worker's compensation]], [[insurance law]], [[consumer protection]] laws, [[labor law]],&lt;ref&gt;See, Syllabus summary, "LAW-665 Employment and Labor Law: Workers and the Law," found at [http://www.wcl.american.edu/registrar/elective_courses.cfm American University Law School website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012015421/http://www.wcl.american.edu/registrar/elective_courses.cfm |date=October 12, 2008 }}.

==As a miscellaneous type of wrong-doing==
Lakshman suggests there may be scholars who have viewed certain recently created torts, such as [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]], as quasi-torts.

Raymond T. Nimmer used the term in:- "[[Restatement (Second) of Torts]] section 552 on [[negligent misrepresentation]] ... deals with a quasi-tort, [[quasi-contract]] form of [[Legal liability|liability]]."&lt;ref&gt;Raymond T. Nimmer, "Breaking Barriers: The Relation Between Contract and Intellectual Property Law," found at [http://www.law.berkeley.edu/journals/btlj/articles/vol13/Nimmer/html/text.html U. of California Berkeley Law School website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705224720/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/journals/btlj/articles/vol13/Nimmer/html/text.html |date=July 5, 2008 }}. Retrieved November 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakshman Marasinghe posits that it is a category where the wrong is ''both'' a contract ''and'' a tort, such as with [[legal malpractice]],&lt;ref&gt;Francis M. Burdick, ''The Law of Torts'', p. 28, (Beard Books, 2000, {{ISBN|1-58798-000-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58798-000-8}}), found at [https://books.google.com/books?id=OrAYJIeC-4cC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=%22quasi+tort%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=W7OVuY96vM&amp;sig=Pa1m-0nDtsYDkLDfkB3jMjYitMg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result]. Retrieved November 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[medical malpractice]]. For example, [[New York (state)|New York]] law applies the same [[statute of limitations]] "for [[Physician|medical]], [[Dentist|dental]] or [[Podiatrist|podiatric]] [[malpractice]] to be commenced within two years and six months," whether under contract or tort theories.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y.

{{distinguish|sherif}}
A '''sheriff''' is a government official, with varying duties, existing in some countries with historical ties to England, where the office originated. There is an analogous although independently developed office in Iceland that is commonly translated to English as ''sheriff'', and this is discussed below.

==Description==
Historically, a sheriff was a [[legal]] official with responsibility for a [[shire]], the term being a contraction of 
{{anchor|shire reeve}} "[[shire]] [[Reeve (England)|reeve]]" ([[Old English]] {{lang|ang|scīrgerefa}}).
In [[British English]], the political or legal office of a sheriff, term of office of a sheriff, or jurisdiction of a sheriff, is called a '''shrievalty'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shrievalty|title=Definition of SHRIEVALTY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in England and Wales, and a [[sheriffdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishlaw.org.uk/scotlaw/sheriff.htm|title=Sheriff Courts and Sheriffdoms in Scotland - Scots Law|publisher=Kevin F Crombie|date=2009|access-date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Scotland.

In modern times, the specific combination of legal, political and ceremonial duties of a sheriff varies greatly from country to country.
* In [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], or [[Wales]], a sheriff (or [[high sheriff]]) is a ceremonial county or city official.
* In [[Scotland]], sheriffs are [[judge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk/36/0/Sheriffs|title=Sheriffs - Judicial Office Holders - About the Judiciary - Judiciary of Scotland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Republic of Ireland]],  in some counties and in the cities of [[Dublin]] and [[Cork (city)|Cork]], sheriffs are legal officials similar to [[bailiff]]s.
* In the [[United States]], a sheriff is a sworn [[law enforcement officer]], whose duties vary across states and counties. A sheriff is generally an elected [[County (United States)|county]] official, with duties that typically include policing [[unincorporated area]]s, maintaining county [[jail]]s, providing security to courts in the county, and (in some states) serving [[warrant (law)|warrants]] and court papers. In addition to these policing and correction services, a sheriff is often responsible for enforcing [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] within the jurisdiction.
*In [[Canada]], sheriffs exist in most provinces. The provincial sheriff services generally manage and transport court prisoners, serve court orders, and in some provinces sheriffs provide security for the court system, protect public officials, support investigations by local police services and in [[Alberta]], sheriffs carry out traffic enforcement.
*In [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]] sheriffs are legal officials similar to [[bailiff]]s. In these countries there is no link maintained between counties and sheriffs.
*In [[India]], a sheriff is a largely ceremonial office in some major cities.

==Great Britain and Ireland==
===England, Wales and Northern Ireland===
{{see|High Sheriff|List of shrievalties}}
The Old English term  designated a royal official (a reeve)  responsible for keeping the peace throughout a shire or county on behalf of the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sheriff&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was preserved in England notwithstanding the [[Norman Conquest]].  

Today,  sheriff or [[high sheriff]] is a ceremonial county or city official.

===Scotland===
{{Main|Sheriff court|Sheriff principal}}
In [[Scotland]] the sheriff is a [[judge|judicial office holder]] in the [[sheriff court|sheriff courts]], and they are members of the [[judiciary of Scotland]].&lt;ref name="scottishsheriffs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheriffs - Judicial Office Holders - About the Judiciary - Judiciary of Scotland|url=http://www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk/36/0/Sheriffs|website=www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk|publisher=Judicial Office for Scotland|accessdate=3 April 2017|language=en|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sheriffs principal====
The most senior sheriffs are the [[sheriff principal|sheriffs principal]], who have administrative as well as judicial authority in the six [[sheriffdom]]s, and are responsible for the effective running and administration of all the sheriff courts in their jurisdiction. Sheriffs principal also sit as appeal sheriffs in the [[Sheriff Appeal Court]]; hearing appeals against [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] and [[conviction]] from [[summary offence|summary trials]] in the sheriff courts and [[justice of the peace court]]s.&lt;ref name="profileprincipal"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Judicial Office for Scotland|title=The Office of Sheriff Principal|url=https://www.judicialappointments.scot/sites/default/files/files/information_pages/The%20Office%20of%20Sheriff%20Principal.doc|website=www.judicialappointments.scot|publisher=Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland|accessdate=4 April 2017|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The additional duties of a sheriff principal include being [[Northern Lighthouse Board|Commissioners of the Northern Lighthouse Board]] (which is the [[general lighthouse authority]] for Scotland), and chairing local criminal justice boards which bring together local representatives of [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service|procurator fiscal]], [[Police Scotland]] and [[Community Justice Scotland]], and [[Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service]].&lt;ref name="NLB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Schedule 8 of Merchant Shipping Act 1995|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/21/schedule/8|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=en|date=19 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="localboards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Criminal Justice Boards|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/archive/law-order/Local|website=www.gov.scot|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=English|date=3 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sheriffs====
Sheriffs deal with the majority of civil and criminal court cases in Scotland, with the power to preside in [[solemn proceedings]] with a [[Trial by jury in Scotland|jury of 15]] for [[indictable offence]]s and sitting alone in summary proceedings for [[summary offence]]s. A sheriff must be [[legal education|legally qualified]], and have been qualified as an [[Faculty of Advocates|advocate]] or [[Law Society of Scotland|solicitor]] for at least 10 years. The maximum sentencing power of sheriff in summary proceedings is 12 months [[imprisonment]], or a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] of up to £10,000. In solemn proceedings the maximum sentence is 5 years imprisonment, or an unlimited fine.&lt;ref name="scottishsheriffs" /&gt;

Sheriffs also preside over [[fatal accident inquiry|fatal accident inquiries]] which are convened to examine the circumstances around sudden or suspicious deaths, including those who die in the course of employment, in [[Detention (imprisonment)|custody]], or in secure accommodation.&lt;ref name=FAI1976&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1976/14 | title=Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976 | publisher=Legislation.gov.uk | date=13 April 1976 | accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FAI"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Judicial Office for Scotland|title=The Office of Sheriff|url=https://www.judicialappointments.scot/sites/default/files/files/information_pages/The%20Office%20of%20Sheriff.doc|website=www.judicialappointments.scot|publisher=Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland|accessdate=4 April 2017|page=9|language=en|format=DOC|quote=34) The sheriff is required to make certain findings and is empowered to make recommendations to avoid a recurrence of the incident.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Summary sheriffs====
Summary sheriffs hear civil cases brought under Simple Procedure and criminal cases brought under summary proceedings. Their sentencing powers are identical to a sheriff sitting in summary proceedings.&lt;ref name="summarysheriffs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Sheriffs - Judicial Office Holders - About the Judiciary - Judiciary of Scotland|url=http://www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk/39/0/Summary-Sheriffs|website=www.scotland-judiciary.org.uk|publisher=Judicial Office for Scotland|accessdate=3 April 2017|language=en|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
Sheriffs have been appointed in Ireland since the [[Norman conquest of Ireland|Norman conquest]] (late 12th century) to enforce court judgements. In the modern day, a sheriff ({{Lang-ga|sirriam}}) is an officer who collects taxes on behalf of the Collector General (part of the [[Revenue Commissioners]]). There are sixteen sheriffs in the country: two in [[Dublin]], two in [[Cork (city)|Cork City]] and twelve for the rest of the country. These twelve sheriffs are also [[county registrar]]s. Sheriffs enforce the repayment of a [[debt]] which has been specified by [[court order]]. This can be in the form of payment or, failing that, in the removal and subsequent disposal of assets (a property and/or its contents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/explainer-irelands-sheriffs-541570-Aug2012/|title=Explainer: Who and what are Ireland’s sheriffs?|first=Paul|last=Hyland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
{{Main|Law enforcement in Australia}}

A sheriff's office exists in most [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states and territories]], with various duties.

* Before 1824, prisons in the British penal colony of [[New South Wales]] were overseen by the [[Provost Marshal]]. This title/position was replaced by that of Sheriff when a ''Charter of Justice'' was [[proclamation|proclaimed]] in 1824.&lt;ref name="O'Toole"&gt;Sean O'Toole, ''The History of Australian Corrections'' (University of New South Wales Press, 2006) p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to detaining accused criminals awaiting trial, the sheriff executed [[death sentence]]s and other sentences, controlled [[gaol]]s, and handled prison movements, including the [[chain gang]]s that worked on [[Goat Island (Port Jackson)|Goat Island]] and in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name="O'Toole"/&gt;  In 1867, the sheriff began to be replaced by an independent Prisons Department, led by an inspector general, which was later renamed comptroller general. Most Australian states adopted this mode of prison oversight for many years.&lt;ref name="O'Toole"/&gt; In [[New South Wales]], the Office of the Sheriff is part of Courts and Tribunal Services. The office has more than 400 employees at 58 sheriff's office.  In addition to enforcing [[writ]]s, warrants, and property seizure orders issued by New South Wales courts and tribunals, the Office of the Sheriff also provides court security and administers the state's [[jury]] service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.justice.nsw.gov.au/Pages/cats/catscorporate_aboutus/catscorporate_officeofsheriff/catscorporate_officeofsheriff.aspx Office of the Sheriff of New South Wales], [[Government of New South Wales]] (accessed August 20, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]], the sheriff's office is part of the Victoria Department of Justice and Regulation. The office enforces [[Warrant (law)|warrant]]s and orders issued by [[Australian court hierarchy|Victoria courts]] dealing with unpaid [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s (in criminal matters) and unpaid [[money judgment]]s (in civil matters).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.vic.gov.au/home/justice+system/sheriffs+in+victoria/ Sheriffs in Victoria], Victoria Department of Justice and Regulation (accessed August 20, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The Victoria sheriff's office has various enforcement powers against [[judgment debtor]]s; they may seize and sell a debtor's assets to satisfy a judgment, place a [[wheel clamp]] on a debtor's car, or direct [[VicRoads]] to suspend a debtor's [[Driving licence in Australia|driver's license]] or [[Vehicle registration plates of Australia|vehicle registration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.vic.gov.au/home/justice+system/sheriffs+in+victoria/sheriff+enforcement+powers/ Sheriff enforcement powers], Victoria Department of Justice and Regulation (accessed August 20, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Sheriff of Western Australia – also known as the Sheriff of the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia|Supreme Court]], Marshal of the [[Family Court of Western Australia|Family Court]] and Marshal of the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] in Western Australia – is an officer of those courts, as well as the [[District Court of Western Australia|District Court]] and the [[Magistrates Court of Western Australia|Magistrates Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ar.dotag.wa.gov.au/S/sheriff_of_western_australia.aspx?uid=1350-3819-6245-4389|title=Sheriff of Western Australia|first=Department of the Attorney|last=General|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sheriff has two main roles.
** "Enforcement services": managing the [[Service of process|serving]] of court documents, including summonses, and the execution of writs, warrants and orders to recover unpaid fines or debts resulting from court judgments; as such, the Sheriff is also responsible for the appointment of bailiffs – who carry out the above services on behalf of the Sheriff.
** "Jury services": preparing jury books, which list people potentially available for jury duty, within 17 jury districts in Western Australia, as well as actually summoning people to act as jurors in the Supreme and District courts; the Sheriff also investigates any failure by jurors to attend court and also has responsibility for the day-to-day management of juries sitting in the [[Perth metropolitan area]].

==North America==
===Canada===
Most provinces and territories in Canada operate a sheriffs service. Sheriffs are primarily concerned with services such as courtroom security, post-arrest prisoner transfer, serving legal processes and executing civil judgements. Sheriffs are defined under section 2 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] as "peace officers". Sheriff's duties in Ontario deal only with serving legal processes and executing civil judgments. They do not perform court security-related duties. Court security functions are handled by the jurisdictional police (municipal police or the [[Ontario Provincial Police]]) in which the courthouse is located. In other parts of Canada, where sheriff's services do not exist, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] perform these duties. Quebec has a two-tiered court security system where armed provincial special [[constable]]s perform court security and the provincial correctional officers perform prisoner escort/transport duties.

====Alberta====
{{See also|Alberta Sheriffs Branch}}
In 2006, the Province of [[Alberta]] expanded the duties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alberta sheriffs make highway debut this weekend |publisher=CBC |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2006/09/01/alberta-sheriffs.html |accessdate=2008-06-03 |date=September 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701044227/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2006/09/01/alberta-sheriffs.html |archivedate=July 1, 2008 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Alberta Sheriffs Branch]] (the successor to the former Courts and Prisoner Security agency) to include traffic enforcement, [[Protective security units|protective security]] and some investigation functions (Sheriffs Investigative Support Unit and Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Unit). As of June 2008, the Alberta Sheriffs Branch traffic division includes 105 traffic sheriffs who are assigned to one of seven regions in the province. Sheriffs also assist various police services in Alberta with prisoner management.

====British Columbia====
{{See also|British Columbia Sheriff Services}}
The responsibilities of sheriffs in the Province of British Columbia include providing security for the Provincial Court, Supreme Court, and Court of Appeal; planning high-security trials; providing an intelligence unit; assessing threats towards public officials and those employed in the justice system; protecting judges and Crown prosecutors; managing detention cells; transporting prisoners by ground and air; managing and providing protection for juries; serving court-related documents; executing court orders and warrants; and assisting with the coroner's court.

====Nova Scotia====
In the Province of Nova Scotia, the sheriffs service focuses on the safety and security of the judiciary, court staff, the public, and persons in custody. There are local sheriffs for every county in Nova Scotia, numbering over 200 in total. They work with up to 20,000 inmates and travel over 2 million kilometers in a year.  Sheriffs are responsible for: court security; the transportation of prisoners to and from institutions and all levels of court; the service of some civil and criminal documents; and the execution of court orders.

===United States===
{{Main|Sheriffs in the United States}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
The office of sheriff as county official in [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial North America]] is recorded from the 1660s.
In the modern United States, the scope of a sheriff varies across [[U.S. state|states]] and [[County (United States)|counties]] (which in [[Louisiana]] are called "parishes" and in [[Alaska]] "boroughs"). The sheriff is most often an elected county official who serves as the chief [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] [[Law enforcement officer#United States|enforcement officer]] of their jurisdiction. The sheriff enforces court orders and mandates and may perform duties such as [[evictions]], seizing property and assets pursuant to court orders, and serving [[warrant (law)|warrants]] and [[service of process|legal papers]]. In some counties where urban areas have their own police departments, a sheriff may be restricted to [[Civil procedure in the United States|civil procedure]] enforcement duties, while in other counties, the sheriff may serve as the principal [[police]] force and have jurisdiction over all of the county's [[Municipality|municipalities]], regardless if they have their own city or town/township police department. A sheriff often administers the county jails and is responsible for court security functions within their jurisdiction.

==India==
{{see also|Category:Sheriffs of India}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Among cities in [[India]], only [[Sheriff of Mumbai|Mumbai]] (Bombay), [[Sheriff of Kolkata|Kolkata]] (Calcutta) and [[Sheriff of Madras|Chennai]] (Madras), the three former British Presidencies, have had a Sheriff. First established in the 1700s based on the English High Sheriffs, they were the executive arm of the Judiciary, responsible for assembling jurors, bringing people to trial, supervising the gaoling (imprisonment) of prisoners and seizing and selling property. After the mid-1800s the responsibilities and powers of the role were reduced and the positions became ceremonial. The Sheriffs of Mumbai and Kolkata still exist, although the post in [[Chennai]] was abolished in 1998. 

In present times the sheriff has an apolitical, non-executive role, presides over various city-related functions and conferences and welcomes foreign guests. The post is second to the mayor in the protocol list.

==South Africa==
{{main article|Sheriffs in South Africa}}
In South Africa, the sheriffs are officers of the court and function as the executive arm of the court. They are responsible for serving court processes like summonses and subpoenas. They play an important role in the execution of court orders like the attachments of immovable and movable property; evictions, demolitions etc.

The Sheriffs Act 90 of 1986, which came into operation on 1 March 1990, governs the profession. A sheriff is appointed by the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development in terms of Section 2 of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheriffs.org.za|title=home|website=www.sheriffs.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iceland===
{{Main|Sýslumaður}}
{{splitsection|Sýslumaður|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--already has its own page, no need to treat this particular term here--&gt;
In [[Iceland]],   ''sýslumenn'' (singular {{lang|is|sýslumaður}}, translated "sheriff"{{by whom|date=November 2018}}) are administrators of the [[Sovereign state|state]], holders of the [[executive power]] in their [[Jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] and heads of their Sheriff's Office. Sheriffs are in charge of certain legal matters that typically involve registration of some sort and executing the orders of the court. The duties of the sheriffs differ slightly depending on their jurisdiction but they can be broadly categorised as:

* Duties of all sheriffs: [[Marriage|marital]] matters (such as general registration of [[marital status]] and performing [[civil marriage]]s), [[Age of consent|statutory]] matters, [[inheritance]] matters and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Duties of all sheriffs except in [[Reykjavík]]: collection of public fees, publication of licences and permits for various personal and business purposes and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are 24 sheriffs and sheriff jurisdictions in Iceland. The jurisdictions are not defined by the [[administrative divisions of Iceland]] but are mainly a mixture of [[County|counties]] and [[Municipality|municipalities]].

The post of sheriff was mandated by the [[Old Covenant (Iceland)|Old Covenant]], an agreement between the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] and the [[Norway|Kingdom of Norway]]. The agreement which was ratified between 1262 and 1264 makes the post of sheriff the oldest secular position of government still operating in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6567">'''Simplified Acquisition Procedures''' ('''SAP''') are a set of streamlined procedures for [[government procurement in the United States]] that reduce the administrative burden of awarding procurements below a threshold value, which as of 2014 is $150,000.  SAP is described in {{USCFR|48|13||}}.  

== Procedure ==
SAP allows informal quoting and competition procedures for simple, small-dollar-value purchases.

== History ==
SAP was authorized by the [[Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994]] (FASA), and expanded by the [[Federal Acquisition Reform Act of 1996]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The procedures were developed in the context of the [[National Partnership for Reinventing Government]], an initiative of the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] to increase government efficiency that began in 1993.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://federalnewsradio.com/federal-drive/2012/05/buying-commercial-in-dod-15-years-after-acquisition-reform/|title=Buying commercial in DoD: 15 years after acquisition reform|last=Serbu|first=Jared|date=2012-05-21|work=Federal News Radio|access-date=2018-04-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of a push to reduce costs and development time by favoring commercially available products instead of ones custom-designed to unique specifications. Vice President [[Al Gore]] had advocated for acquisition reform by appearing on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and smashed a government acquired ashtray to demonstrate a regulation that glass [[Ashtray|ashtrays]] must not break into more than 35 shards of glass when broken over a [[maple]] plank.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

SAP funding has grown even while total federal contracting expenditures have fallen, hitting a 10-year peak in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://federalnewsradio.com/acquisition/2017/04/8-trends-to-keep-ahead-of-in-federal-contracting/|title=8 trends to keep ahead of in federal contracting|last=Thornton|first=David|date=2017-04-28|work=Federal News Radio|access-date=2018-04-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017]], the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]'s ability to use SAP was expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://federalnewsradio.com/air-force/2017/06/air-force-plans-june-summit-to-scrub-acquisition-regulations/|title=Air Force plans June summit to scrub acquisition regulations|last=Serbu|first=Jared|date=2017-06-07|work=Federal News Radio|access-date=2018-04-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2018/3/6/pilot-program-will-streamline-contracting|title=Pilot Program Will Streamline Contracting|last=Biagini|first=Ray|last2=Fenster|first2=Herb|date=2018-03-06|website=National Defense Magazine|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-12|last3=Hoe|first3=Sandy|last4=Willauer|first4=Michelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS)''' is the key administrative service of the [[Government of Sri Lanka]], with civil servants working for both in the Central Government as well as in the provincial councils... It was formed as the ''Ceylon Administrative Service'' (CAS) in 1963 as the successor to the [[Ceylon Civil Service]] which was abolished on May 1, 1963. It is the senior of the [[Public Services of Sri Lanka|public service]]s.

Based on the [[British Civil Service]] the SLAS is the permanent [[bureaucracy]] that helps the elected officials on day-to-day functions of government. They are selected, promoted by the [[Civil service commission|Public Service Commission]]. But top positions in the government such as Permanent Secretaries are appointed by the President, in theory on the recommendations of the Public Service Commission.

A Permanent Secretary is the top bureaucrat of the government ministry and is responsible for the day-to-day functions of the ministry whereas in theory the [[Minister (government)|minister]] is responsible only for drafting policy. The head of the SLAS is the [[Presidential Secretariat|Secretary to the President]].

A Chief Secretary is a Special Grade officer of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service in the provinces which is equivalent to a Permanent Secretary of the central government known as Chief Secretary. There are nine Chief Secretaries, one for each of the [[Provinces of Sri Lanka|nine provinces]].

==Grading schemes==
Until 2005, broader term officers are classed into SLAS class 1 officers, SLAS class 2 grade 1, and SLAS class 2 grade 2. All grades from SLAS class 1 and above (see table) are part of the "Senior officers ". The [[Secretary to the Treasury (Sri lanka)|Secretary to the Treasury]] was the traditional head of the Civil Service during the time of the old [[Ceylon Civil Service]], but in years after the establishment of the SLAS the Presidents Secretary is the de facto head of the SLAS.

After 1 January 2005 Sri Lanka Administrative service introduced four grades, such as:
* Special Grade offices (present cadre is 200)
* Class I officers (present cadre is 507)
* Class II officers (present cadre is 639)
* Class III officers (present cadre is 1059)

Below the "Senior officers "(Special Grade offices, Class I officers and ), each individual department can put in place its own grading.

The traditional titles for each grade of the civil service are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Traditional Title                !! Alternative Title                              !! Grade
|-
|  [[Presidential Secretariat|Secretary to the President]]     ||   [[Secretary to the Treasury (Sri lanka)|Secretary to the Treasury]]                         ||Special Grade offices
|-
|  [[Permanent Secretary]]        || Chief Secretary                                                ||Special Grade officers
|-
|  Additional Secretary           || [[Commissioner-General]], [[Director-General]]  ||Special Grade officers
|-
|  Senior Assistant Secretary     || [[Commissioner]], Director                      ||Class I officers
|-
|  Assistant Secretary            || Deputy Commissioner, Deputy Director            ||Class II officers
|-
|  Titles vary widely             || Assistant Commissioner, Assistant Director      ||Class II officers
|}

* The post of Deputy Secretary is only used in the Ministry of Finance is ranked just below the post of Permanent Secretary.

'''Sustainable markets''' can be loosely defined as those that contribute to stronger livelihoods and more [[sustainable]] environments. In linking with the pursuit of ‘[[sustainable development]]’, such markets have a multiple focus on social, environmental and economic outcomes. Sustainable markets aim to reflect the true costs (or [[externalities]]) of [[natural resource]] [[Environmental degradation|degradation]], [[environmental pollution]], and promote just and [[Occupational safety and health|safe labour]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;Skoll Foundation (2015) ‘Sustainable Markets page’ http://www.skollfoundation.org/issue/sustainable-markets/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key tools ==

In transitioning to sustainable markets, formal rules sometimes called [[market governance mechanism]]s (MGMS)are key potential tools to shape and govern markets. Examples could include Fairtrade certification, sustainable reporting and metrics, payments for [[ecosystem services]] or other market-based instruments. MGMs change the behaviour of consumers, investors or producers so that their decisions result in more sustainable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;IIED Sustainable Markets Group (2011) ‘Research prospectus – Shaping Sustainable Markets’ http://shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/sites/shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/files/20110520%20Research%20prospectus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; MGMs could provide economic signals or incentives, for example in pricing externalities. Regulatory mechanisms could prohibit or require certain practices by consumers or producers. Or cooperative mechanisms could create voluntary or more formal partnerships around environmental norms or standards.

== Debates ==

There are a number of contentious issues and ongoing debates around sustainable markets, particularly in how to achieve sustainable markets. There are questions around the appropriate mix of policy instruments or mechanisms, and for which context. For example, a developing world country may require specific mechanisms to build sustainable markets, particularly where more informal or fledgling economies exist. These also involve wider debates over how economic globalisation and trade can benefit countries where local capacities or institutions are weak.

Furthermore, there are unresolved debates over how much regulation or [[economic interventionism|government intervention]] is appropriate in order to govern sustainable markets. For example, in pricing pollution like [[greenhouse gases]] (GHGs), there are competing arguments over whether there should be government-mandated taxes to limit pollution by economic disincentives or whether a market should determine the price to pollute. In many cases a mixture of both may be favourable.

Broader questions remain over whether sustainable markets can ever fully account for environmental externalities, such as those associated with pollution. This relates to whether an economic model focused on [[GDP]] rather than wellbeing can truly bring about the transformation outlined in sustainable development. There have been suggestions that a move away from a pure focus on GDP is required, towards an emphasis represented in methods such as [[natural capital]] accounting.

== Organizations ==

A number of organizations are working in the sustainable markets field.

* The [[International Institute for Environment and Development]]’s Sustainable Markets Group develops research and analysis towards sustainable markets and the debates and innovations shaping markets.&lt;ref&gt;International Institute for Environment and Development (2015) http://www.iied.org/group/sustainable-markets&lt;/ref&gt; This research also includes a database of market governance mechanisms. 
* The U.S based [[Skoll Foundation]] runs a programme on sustainable markets which focuses on areas such as responsible supply chains, access to finance for sustainable small and medium enterprises including clean energy companies and work on environmental standards and certification.&lt;ref&gt;Skoll Foundation (2015) ‘Sustainable Markets page’ http://www.skollfoundation.org/issue/sustainable-markets/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] runs the Sustainable Markets and Responsible Trade initiative.&lt;ref&gt;International Institute for Sustainable Development (2013) ‘Sustainable Markets and Responsible Trade’ https://www.iisd.org/markets/&lt;/ref&gt; This focuses on the sustainability of international trade and the design and implementation of supply chains. 
* The Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets, based at [[Stockholm School of Economics]], aims to provide policy research and advice to Swedish and international actors. Misum is a cross-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder knowledge center dedicated to sustainability and sustainable markets and contains three research platforms: Sustainability in Financial Markets (Mistra Financial Systems), Sustainability in Production and Consumption and Sustainable Socio-Economic Development.&lt;ref&gt;Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets (2015) http://www.hhs.se/misum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mistra.org/forskning/pagaende-forskning/misum---mistra-center-for-sustainable-markets.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Yale Journal of International Law''''' is a student-edited [[International law|international]] [[law review]] at the [[Yale Law School]] ([[New Haven, Connecticut]]). The [[academic journal|journal]] publishes articles, essays, notes, and commentary that cover a wide range of  topics in international and [[comparative law]].

==History==
''The Yale Journal of International Law'' is the oldest of Yale Law School's eight secondary journals still in publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/yjil/abouthistory.html ''Yale Journal of International Law'' - History]&lt;/ref&gt; The journal was founded in 1974 by a group of students who were followers of the [[Approaches to International Law#New Haven Approach|New Haven School]] of international law,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yale.edu/yjil/files_PDFs/Suzuki.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and their publication was originally known as ''Yale Studies in World Public Order''. Under the leadership of then [[editor in chief]] Eisuke Suzuki, a graduate fellow from [[Tokyo]], the first issue was produced without assistance from the Law School.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[W. Michael Reisman]], ''The Vision and Mission of The Yale Journal of International Law'', ''Yale J. Int. Law'' 25:263 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; After being renamed ''The Yale Journal of World Public Order'', the journal obtained its current title. About ten years after its founding, the Yale Law School started to support the journal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Content==
[[Image:yjil logo.png|right|thumb|upright|The journal's Seal]]
Some of the journal's most-cited articles include:&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred R. Shapiro]], ''The Ten Most-Cited Works from The Yale Journal of International Law and Its Predecessors, Yale Studies in World Public Order and The Yale Journal of World Public Order'', ''Yale J.
Int. Law'' 25:271 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

*Daniel Bodansky, ''[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]]: A Commentary'', ''Yale J. Int. Law'' 18:451 (1993)

==Rankings==
The journal was ranked second among international law reviews in the 2007 ''[[ExpressO Guide to Top Law Reviews]]'' based on the number of manuscripts received.&lt;ref name=ExpressO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.bepress.com/expresso/2007/subject.html |title=2007 Top Law Reviews: Most Popular Subjects |work=ExpressO |accessdate=2010-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
In collaboration with ''[[Opinio Juris]],'' occasional online symposia centering on scholarly conversations on articles published in the journal are organized. In collaboration with the [[Forum on the Practice of International Law]], the journal periodically convenes panels, workshops, and talks on diverse topics with guests including [[Yale University|Yale]] faculty, practicing international lawyers, distinguished alumni, and other campus visitors.  In addition, the journal organizes a "works in progress" series at which Yale [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] and graduate law students present papers to their colleagues with a faculty respondent who provides feedback and constructive criticism. Some recent events are:

*[[Approaches to International Law#New New Haven Approach|The "New" New Haven School]] (2007)
*[[Nation-building|Nation Building]] in the [[Middle East]] (2005)
*Reflections on the [[International Court of Justice]]'s ''[[Operation Nimble Archer#International Court of Justice case|Oil Platforms]]'' Decision (2004)
*Current Pressures on [[International Humanitarian Law]] (2003)
*Reflections on the International Court of Justice’s [[LaGrand case|''LaGrand'']] Decision (2002)
*Realistic [[Idealism]] in International Law, a conference in honor of [[W. Michael Reisman]]. Selected proceedings from this conference were published in the Summer 2009 issue.

The '''Titles Deprivation Act 1917''' is an [[Act of Parliament]] of the United Kingdom which authorised enemies of the United Kingdom during the [[First World War]] to be deprived of their British [[peerage]]s and royal titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=American Bar Association|title=American Bar Association Journal|year=1919|location=Chicago|chapter=Foreign Legislation-Great Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1QuAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Titles%20Deprivation%20Act&amp;pg=PA289#v=onepage&amp;q=Titles%20Deprivation%20Act&amp;f=false|volume=5 | page= 289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The British Royal Family was closely related to many of the royal and princely families of Germany.  In particular, the 1837 accession of [[Queen Victoria]] had caused the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], which had been in [[personal union]] with the British crown for over a century, to pass to her uncle [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|the Duke of Cumberland]] and his descendants, who simultaneously retained his British titles and princely rank.  Similarly, [[Queen Victoria]] married Prince [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], whose German titles passed eventually to the descendants of their youngest son [[Leopold, Duke of Albany]].  Thus, during World War I, both [[Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and [[Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover|Ernest Augustus, former Crown Prince of Hanover]] were British princes and dukes, even while they were also officers in the German Army (as was the latter's son, [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick]], who also held British princely rank).

==Deprivation of titles==
The Act allowed the King to establish a committee of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], which was to include at least two members of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. The committee was empowered to take evidence and report the names of British peers or princes "who have, during the present war, borne arms against His Majesty or His Allies, or who have adhered to His Majesty's enemies". The report would then be laid before both Houses of Parliament; if neither House passed a motion disapproving of the report within forty days, it was to be submitted to the King, whereupon the persons named therein would lose all British dignities. Thereafter, a successor of a person thus deprived of a peerage would be allowed to petition the Crown for revival of the deprived title; the petition would be referred to a committee of the Privy Council, which would recommend whether the petitioner be reinstated or not.  In no event, however, did the Act "affect the title or succession of any person to any estates or other property".&lt;ref&gt;Act s. 3(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Act, the King appointed to the committee:
*[[Robert Finlay, 1st Viscount Finlay|The Lord Finlay]] ([[Lord Chancellor]])
*[[William Mansfield, 1st Viscount Sandhurst|The Viscount Sandhurst]] ([[Lord Chamberlain|Lord Chamberlain of the Household]])
*[[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|The Marquess of Lansdowne]] 
*[[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|The Marquess of Crewe]] 
*[[Thomas Legh, 2nd Baron Newton|The Lord Newton]]
*[[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|The Lord Stamfordham]] ([[Private Secretary to the Sovereign]])
*[[John Hamilton, 1st Viscount Sumner|The Lord Sumner]] (a [[Lord of Appeal in Ordinary]])

The committee was established by an [[Order in Council]] issued by the King on 27 November 1917.

The committee issued its report on 1 August 1918 and it was thereafter laid before the Houses of Parliament. Since no resolution was passed by either House disapproving of the report, it was presented to the King on 28 March 1919, and, on the same date the King issued an Order in Council depriving the following persons of their titles&lt;ref name="28 March 1919" &gt;{{cite web|title=At the Court at Buckingham Palace, the 28th day of March, 1919.|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/31255/pages/4000|work=[[London Gazette]]|publisher=His Majesty's Stationery Office|accessdate=28 November 2011|pages=Issue 31255, Page 4000|date=28 March 1919|quote=Their Lordships do humbly report to Your Majesty that the persons hereinafter named have adhered to Your Majesty's enemies during the present war: —His Royal Highness Leopold Charles, Duke of Albany, Earl of Clarence and Baron Arklow; His Royal Highness Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, Earl of Armagh; His Royal Highness Ernest Augustus (Duke of Brunswick), Prince of Great Britain and Ireland; Henry, Viscount Taaffe of Corren and Baron of Ballymote}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the names are listed in the form given in the King's Order in Council):

*[[Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|His Royal Highness Charles Edward, Duke of Albany, Earl of Clarence and Baron Arklow]]
*[[Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover|His Royal Highness Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, Earl of Armagh]]
*[[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|His Royal Highness Ernest Augustus (Duke of Brunswick), Prince of Great Britain and Ireland]] (son and heir-apparent of the Duke of Cumberland)
*[[Henry Taaffe, 12th Viscount Taaffe|Henry, Viscount Taaffe of Corren and Baron of Ballymote]]&lt;ref name="28 March 1919" /&gt;

In addition to the [[Duke of Albany|Dukedom of Albany]] and the [[Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale|Dukedom of Cumberland and Teviotdale]] (the latter title being represented by two of the four people above), the title of [[Viscount Taaffe]] was also lost by its bearer.  The Viscounts Taaffe had emigrated from Ireland to Austria in the 1700s and had served the Austrian emperor since that time, even while their Irish title was confirmed as recently as 1860.

No descendant of any of these four persons has ever petitioned the Crown for the revival of their titles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8331">[[Image:To my people, Franz Joseph, 1914, Czech translation.jpg|right|frame|Czech translation of the manifest]]

'''To my peoples!''' - in [[German language|German]] '''An meine Völker!''', in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] '''Népeimhez!''', in [[Czech language|Czech]] '''Mým národům!''', in [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] '''Mojim narodom!''' - was a [[manifesto]] signed by [[Franz Joseph I]], Emperor of [[Austria-Hungary]] in [[Bad Ischl]] on July 28, 1914. The text announced the declaration of war on [[Serbia]], starting [[World War I]].

{{wikisourcelang|hu|Népeimhez!}}

"''To my people''" was a typical headline of war [[manifesto]]es; it was used in the declaration of [[Austro-Prussian War|war]] on [[Prussia]] in 1866 and in the announcement of the [[Italy|Italian]] entry into World War I (against Austria-Hungary) in 1915. Because Austria-Hungary was a [[multi-ethnic]] empire, 'people' was made plural.

After the [[Assassination in Sarajevo|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Sophie]] in [[Sarajevo]] on June 28, 1914, diplomatic relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia became strained. After weeks of discussions, government and army leaders of the Empire decided to risk war with Serbia, hoping for a short and victorious campaign. 

Emperor Franz Joseph signed the declaration of war in his Imperial Villa in [[Bad Ischl]] on July 28. The document was distributed all over the empire and was widely published on the morning of the next day. At this time, several European countries had already started to mobilize their armies. 

The text presents the aggressiveness of Serbia as the reason for the war, claiming that the Empire had tried all the ways to avoid the conflict. The document was signed by Franz Joseph and [[Karl von Stürgkh]], [[List of Ministers-President of Austria|minister-president]] of Austria. The belief of some that a peaceful solution could be still reached was quickly dashed - all political parties, including the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democrats]], expressed their support for the war.

On July 29, [[Belgrade]] was bombed for the first time. On July 31, Austria-Hungary announced a general mobilization and, on August 12, the [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|invasion of Serbia]] started. Other European powers entered World War I in early August.

The Imperial Rescript and Manifesto.

     Ischl, July 28.

     Dear Count Stürgkh:

     I have resolved to instruct the Ministers of my Household and
     Foreign Affairs to notify the Royal Serbian Government of the
     beginning of a state of war between the Monarchy and Serbia. In
     this fateful hour I feel the need of turning to my beloved peoples.
     I command you, therefore, to publish the inclosed manifesto.

MANIFESTO.

     To my peoples! It was my fervent wish to consecrate the years
     which, by the grace of God, still remain to me, to the works of
     peace and to protect my peoples from the heavy sacrifices and
     burdens of war. Providence, in its wisdom, has otherwise decreed.
     The intrigues of a malevolent opponent compel me, in the defense of
     the honor of my Monarchy, for the protection of its dignity and its
     position as a power, for the security of its possessions, to grasp
     the sword after long years of peace.

     With a quickly forgetful ingratitude, the Kingdom of Serbia, which,
     from the first beginnings of its independence as a State until
     quite recently, had been supported and assisted by my ancestors,
     has for years trodden the path of open hostility to
     Austria-Hungary. When, after three decades of fruitful work for
     peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, I extended my Sovereign rights to
     those lands, my decree called forth in the Kingdom of Serbia, whose
     rights were in nowise injured, outbreaks of unrestrained passion
     and the bitterest hate. My Government at that time employed the
     handsome privileges of the stronger, and with extreme consideration
     and leniency only requested Serbia to reduce her army to a peace
     footing and to promise that, for the future, she would tread the
     path of peace and friendship. Guided by the same spirit of
     moderation, my Government, when Serbia, two years ago, was
     embroiled in a struggle with the Turkish Empire, restricted its
     action to the defense of the most serious and vital interests of
     the Monarchy. It was to this attitude that Serbia primarily owed
     the attainment of the objects of that war.

     The hope that the Serbian Kingdom would appreciate the patience and
     love of peace of my Government and would keep its word has not been
     fulfilled. The flame of its hatred for myself and my house has
     blazed always higher; the design to tear from us by force
     inseparable portions of Austria-Hungary has been made manifest with
     less and less disguise. A criminal propaganda has extended over the
     frontier with the object of destroying the foundations of State
     order in the southeastern part of the monarchy; of making
     the people, to whom I, in my paternal affection, extended my full
     confidence, waver in its loyalty to the ruling house and to the
     Fatherland; of leading astray its growing youth and inciting it to
     mischievous deeds of madness and high treason. A series of
     murderous attacks, an organized, carefully prepared, and well
     carried out conspiracy, whose fruitful success wounded me and my
     loyal peoples to the heart, forms a visible bloody track of those
     secret machinations which were operated and directed in Serbia.

     A halt must be called to these intolerable proceedings and an end
     must be put to the incessant provocations of Serbia. The honor and
     dignity of my monarchy must be preserved unimpaired, and its
     political, economic, and military development must be guarded from
     these continual shocks. In vain did my Government make a last
     attempt to accomplish this object by peaceful means and to induce
     Serbia, by means of a serious warning, to desist. Serbia has
     rejected the just and moderate demands of my Government and refused
     to conform to those obligations the fulfillment of which forms the
     natural and necessary foundation of peace in the life of peoples
     and States. I must therefore proceed by force of arms to secure
     those indispensable pledges which alone can insure tranquillity to
     my States within and lasting peace without.

     In this solemn hour I am fully conscious of the whole significance
     of my resolve and my responsibility before the Almighty. I have
     examined and weighed everything, and with a serene conscience I set
     out on the path to which my duty points. I trust in my peoples,
     who, throughout every storm, have always rallied in unity and
     loyalty around my throne, and have always been prepared for the
     severest sacrifices for the honor, the greatness, and the might of
     the Fatherland. I trust in Austria-Hungary's brave and devoted
     forces, and I trust in the Almighty to give the victory to my arms.

     FRANZ JOSEPH mppria

The '''Treaty of the Bogue''' ({{zh|t=虎門條約|s=虎门条约|p=Hǔmén tiáoyuē}}) was a treaty between [[China]] and the [[United Kingdom]], concluded in October 1843 to supplement the previous [[Treaty of Nanking]]. The treaty's key provisions granted [[extraterritoriality]] and [[most favored nation]] status to Britain.

==Background==
In order to conclude the [[First Opium War]], imperial commissioner [[Qiying]] and [[Henry Pottinger]] concluded the Treaty of Nanjing aboard the British warship [[HMS Cornwallis (1813)|HMS ''Cornwallis'']] in 1842 in [[Nanjing]] on the behalf of the [[British Empire]] and the Chinese [[Qing dynasty]].  The treaty became the first of a series of commercial treaties, often referred to as "[[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]]", which China concluded against its wishes with Western powers.

==Terms==
During the negotiations in Nanjing, China and Britain had agreed that a supplementary treaty be concluded, and on 22{{nbsp}}July 1843 the two parties promulgated the  "General Regulations of Trade with Britain and China" in [[Guangzhou]]. These regulations were included in the "Treaty of the Bogue," which Qiying and Pottinger signed on 8{{nbsp}}October 1843 on the [[Bocca Tigris|Bogue]] outside Guangzhou.

The treaty laid down detailed regulations for Sino-British trade and specified terms under which Britons could reside in the newly opened ports of [[Shanghai]], [[Ningbo]], [[Xiamen]], [[Fuzhou]] and [[Guangzhou]]. While Britons were allowed to buy property in the treaty ports and reside there with their families, they were not allowed to travel to the interior of China or trade there.

The treaty also granted [[Extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] privileges to British subjects and [[most Favored Nation]] status to Great Britain, which meant that the latter would enjoy any privilege granted to other powers.

==Aftermath==
In China, the treaty is widely regarded as an imperialist one, which paved the way for the subjugation of China to Western imperialism. The treaty consolidated the "opening" of China to foreign trade in the wake of the First Opium War and allowed Britons to reside in parts of China, which had not been opened to foreigners before. In 1845, local Qing authorities and the British authorities promulgated the Shanghai Land regulations, which paved the way for the foundation of the [[Shanghai International Settlement]]. Similar agreements were concluded in other treaty ports, which created a social divide between the Europeans and Chinese citizens in the cities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7214">'''''USL v. BSDi''''' was a [[lawsuit]] brought in the United States in 1992 by [[Unix System Laboratories]] against [[Berkeley Software Design]], Inc and the [[Regents of the University of California]] over [[intellectual property]] related to the [[Unix]] operating system;&lt;ref name="832 F.Supp. 790"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Unix System Laboratories v. Berkeley Software |vol=832 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=790 |pinpoint= |court=[[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey|D.N.J.]] |date=1993 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/832/790/1428569/ |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a culmination of the [[Unix wars]]. The case was settled out of court in 1994 after the judge expressed doubt in the validity of USL's intellectual property, with [[Novell]] (who by that time had bought USL) and the University agreeing not to litigate further over the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD).

== Background ==
The suit has its roots at the [[Computer Systems Research Group]] (CSRG) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], which had a [[Software license|license]] for the [[source code]] of UNIX from [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]]'s [[Bell Labs]]. Students doing [[operating system]]s research at the CSRG modified and extended UNIX, and the CSRG made several releases of the modified operating system beginning in 1978, with AT&amp;T's blessing. Because this Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) contained copyrighted AT&amp;T Unix [[source code]], it was only available to organizations with a source code license for Unix from AT&amp;T.

Students and faculty at the CSRG audited the software code for the [[TCP/IP]] stack, removing all the AT&amp;T intellectual property, and released it to the general public in 1988 as "[[Net/1]]", under the [[BSD license]].  When it became apparent that the Berkeley CSRG would soon close, students and faculty at the CSRG began an effort to remove all the remaining AT&amp;T code from the BSD and replace it with their own.  This effort resulted in the public release of [[Net/2]] in 1991, again under the BSD license.  Net/2 contained enough code for a nearly complete UNIX-like system, which the CSRG believed contained no AT&amp;T intellectual property.

Berkeley Software Design (BSDi) obtained the source for Net/2, filled in the missing pieces, and [[porting|ported]] it to the Intel [[IA-32|i386]] computer architecture.  BSDi then sold the resulting [[BSD/386]] operating system, which could be ordered through 1-800-ITS-UNIX.  This drew the ire of AT&amp;T, which did not agree with BSDi's claim that BSD/386 was free of AT&amp;T intellectual property. AT&amp;T's [[Unix System Laboratories]] subsidiary filed suit against BSDi in New Jersey in April 1992, a suit that was later amended to include The Regents of the University of California.

== USL's complaint ==
In the lawsuit, USL alleged that:

* The Regents of the University of California, by releasing Net/2 "based upon, substantially copied from, or derived from proprietary UNIX", had
** [[Breach of contract|breached]] USL's software license contract;
** [[Copyright Infringement|infringed]] on USL's copyright on UNIX;
** [[Trademark dilution|diluted]] USL's trademark on UNIX;
** [[Trade_secret#Misappropriation|misappropriated]] USL's trade secret on UNIX.

On these grounds, USL asked the court for a preliminary [[injunction]] that would bar BSDi from distributing the Net/2 software until the case was decided.

== Pretrial ==
At a hearing, BSDi contended that they were using the sources freely distributed by the University of California plus six additional files. BSDI accepted liability for their own six files, but refused to account for the other files distributed by the University of California. The judge agreed with BSDI's argument and told USL to restate their complaint based solely on the six files or he would dismiss it. Rather than narrow down their claim, USL chose to sue BSDI and the University of California, and requested a preliminary injunction on the distribution of Net/2 from both.&lt;ref name="mccusick"&gt;[http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/kirkmck.html Twenty Years of Berkeley Unix: From AT&amp;T-Owned to Freely Redistributable], by [[Marshall Kirk McKusick]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, judge [[Dickinson R. Debevoise]] denied a preliminary injunction, on the grounds that USL had no valid copyright over [[UNIX/32V|32V]] and could not show any obvious trade secret. Works published in the U.S. between January 1, 1978 and March 1, 1989, were subject to the provisions of [[17 U.S.C.]] § 405(a), which required the copyright owner to properly affix a copyright notice to the work in order to claim copyright protection. AT&amp;T released V32 in 1978, but omitted a notice from thousands of copies and failed to copyright 32V until 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/USL/Doc-92.html Court opinion] Civ. No. 92-1667 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

== University's countersuit ==
In 1993, a few days after the dismissal of the preliminary injunction, the University filed a countersuit against USL in California, claiming that USL had failed to credit the University for the use of BSD code in System V, as required by the software license contract. The University demanded that USL be forced to reprint all their documentation with the appropriate due credit added, to notify all their licensees of their oversight, and to run full-page advertisements in major publications such as [[The Wall Street Journal]] and [[Fortune Magazine]] informing the public of their omission.&lt;ref name="mccusick" /&gt;

== Settlement ==
In 1993, soon after UC filed its countersuit, USL was purchased by [[Novell]]. Novell CEO [[Ray Noorda]] favored a settlement that was reached in 1994. The salient points were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/USLsettlement.pdf USL v. BSDi settlement agreement] (Adobe .pdf format), [http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20041126130302760 HTML version]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[4.4BSD]]-lite to be released containing no disputed files. University to encourage licensees to switch from Net/2.
* University to cease distribution of certain files.
* USL to grant three months' grace period to users of disputed files.
* Certain files distributed by University to carry USL copyright notice.
* Certain files distributed by USL to carry University copyright notices.
* USL to permit free distribution of certain files.
* University not to actively assist in legal attempts to challenge USL's rights to certain files.

Of the 18,000 files in the Berkeley distribution, only three had to be removed and 70 modified to show USL copyright notices. A further condition of the settlement was that USL would not file further lawsuits against users and distributors of the upcoming 4.4BSD-Lite release.

[[File:UnCommonLaw1979Cover.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cover of the 1979 edition, showing [[Alastair Sim]] as Mr Justice Swallow, a frequent foil to Haddock]]
'''''Uncommon Law''''' is a book by [[A. P. Herbert]] first published by [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] in 1935. Its title is a satirical reference to the English [[common law]]. The book is an [[anthology]] of fictitious [[law report]]s first published in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' as '''''Misleading Cases''''' in which Herbert explores, as he saw it, rather absurd aspects of the law, and upholds his [[civil liberties]] with the protagonist Albert Haddock, representing Herbert's point of view, taking many to court. It includes perhaps the best-known of these cases, [[Negotiable cow|''The Negotiable Cow'']]. Herbert himself said "Albert Haddock made his first public appearance, in ''Punch'', in 1924. I have always understood that I invented him: but he has made some disturbing escapes into real life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Herbert, 1935|Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over his lifetime Herbert published five collections, entitled ''Misleading Cases in the Common Law'', ''More Misleading Cases'', ''Still More Misleading Cases'', ''Codd's Last Case'' and ''Bardot M.P.?''. Stray cases also appear in his collections of miscellaneous humorous essays, such as ''General Cargo''. Virtually all the cases were assembled into two omnibus volumes, ''Uncommon Law'' in 1935 and ''More Uncommon Law'' in 1982. A shorter selection, ''Wigs at Work'', appeared in 1966.

The [[BBC]] successfully adapted them for television as three series of ''[[A P Herbert's Misleading Cases]]'' (1967, 1968 and 1971: 19 episodes in total), with [[Roy Dotrice]] as Haddock and [[Alastair Sim]] as the judge, Mr Justice Swallow who has to unravel Haddock's logic.

==Selection of cases==
* ''Rex v Haddock'': Is it a Free Country?
: Haddock jumps off [[Hammersmith Bridge]] for a bet and is arrested and charged with numerous offences by the bemused police, including "polluting a watercourse"; his defence is that "there is no law against it" and that he did it "for fun". The [[Lord Chief Justice]] disagrees, saying "it is a fundamental principle of English law that a person who appears in a [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|police court]] has done something undesirable". When questioned on his motive that he did it "for fun", the judge states "We are not here for fun. There is no reference to fun in any Act of Parliament".
* ''Tinrib, Rumble, And Others v The King and Queen'': Fish Royal
: A dead whale is washed up on the shore of Pudding Magna in [[Dorset]] and a dispute ensues as to who is responsible for its disposal, which becomes increasingly urgent as the carcase has started to decompose, making the town unpleasant to live in. It is contended according to precedent that the whale is "[[royal fish|fish royal]]" and therefore the monarch is responsible; however, the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] correctly points out that a whale is a mammal and therefore outside its jurisdiction. The appeal proceeds on the instructions of "the ''late'' residents of Pudding Magna", but is immediately adjourned.
* ''Rex v Haddock'': Is a Golfer a Gentleman?
: The frustrated Mr Haddock, unable to make his golf ball follow its intended trajectory, is heard to utter a stream of swear words, and is summoned under the [[Profane Oaths Act 1745]] which creates differing penalties for different classes of people, including gentlemen, to whom the highest rate is applied. Haddock argues that while playing golf, he is so bad at it that he no longer can be regarded as a gentleman, and therefore his fine should be lowered. He succeeds with this argument.

==Vehicles for law reform==
Being a law reform activist, Herbert, through these "Misleading Cases", aired, initiated and sustained debate on various aspects of the law in which he saw need for change: copyright, divorce, defamation, liquor licensing, the police as [[agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]] (usually Constable Boot) and rules of the road being some of the recurrent themes. At one point, Haddock turns himself into a [[limited company]] and insists  to the court that he be called Haddock, Haddock, Haddock, Haddock Haddock &amp; Co. because the copyright law states that copyright expires after seventy years (in the United Kingdom) (the fictional judge asking "Would this be Mr. Albert Haddock? Then we are in for some fun litigation") but since a company being in law a [[person]] he objects to a [[winding-up order]] to shut the apparently defunct company because ''a company never dies'' and so its copyright can never expire. Every time the prosecution calls him Mr. Haddock he intervenes "You mean the [[Managing Director]]". Haddock (I mean the Managing Director) argues that individuals should have the same rights as companies. The case is found in his favour, Haddock also suggesting to the prosecution that it is open to other authors to take the same tack as he has.

{{Legislature}}
An '''upper house''' is one of two [[debate chamber|chambers]] of a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] (or one of three chambers of a [[tricameralism|tricameral legislature]]), the other chamber being the [[lower house]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bicameralism'' (1997) by George Tsebelis&lt;/ref&gt; The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller and often has more restricted power than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include  the United Kingdom's [[House of Lords]], India's [[Rajya Sabha]], Pakistan's [[Senate of Pakistan]], Russia's [[Federation Council]], Ireland's [[Seanad]], Malaysia's [[Dewan Negara]], Germany's [[bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], Switzerland's [[Council of States (Switzerland)|Council of States]], the [[Australian Senate]] and the [[United States Senate]].

A legislature composed of only one house (and which therefore has neither an upper house nor a lower house) is described as [[unicameral]].

== Possible specific characteristics ==
An upper house is usually different from the lower house in at least one of the following respects:

'''Powers:'''
* In a [[parliamentary system]], it often has much less power than the lower house. Therefore, in certain countries the Upper House
** votes on only limited legislative matters, such as constitutional amendments.
** cannot initiate legislation (or cannot initiate legislation on money).
** cannot vote a [[motion of no confidence]] against the government (or such an act is much less common), while the lower house always can.
* In a [[presidential system]]:
** It may have equal or nearly equal power with the lower house.
** It may have specific powers not granted to the lower house. For example:
*** It may give [[advice and consent]] to some executive decisions (e.g. appointments of cabinet ministers, judges or ambassadors).
*** It may have the sole power to try [[impeachments]] against officials of the [[executive branch|executive]], following enabling resolutions passed by the lower house.
*** It may have the sole power to ratify treaties.

'''Status:'''
* In some countries, its members are not popularly elected; membership may be indirect, hereditary, ex officio or by appointment.
* Its members may be elected with a different voting system than that used to elect the lower house (for example, upper houses in Australia and its states are usually elected by [[proportional representation]], whereas lower houses are not). 
* Less populated states, provinces, or [[administrative division]]s may be better represented in the upper house than in the lower house; representation is not completely proportional to population (or not at all).
* Members' terms may be longer than in the lower house and may be for life.
* Members may be elected in portions, for staggered terms, rather than all at one time.
* In some countries, the upper house cannot be dissolved at all, or can be dissolved only in more limited circumstances than the lower house.
* It typically has fewer members or [[Legislative seat|seats]] than the lower house (though notably not in the [[United Kingdom parliament]]).
* It has usually a higher [[age of candidacy]] than the lower house.

== Powers ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Palazzo-madama-senato.jpg|thumbnail|The chamber of the Italian Senate in [[Rome]]]] --&gt;

=== Parliamentary systems ===
In [[parliamentary system]]s the upper house is frequently seen as an advisory or "revising" chamber; for this reason, its powers of direct action are often reduced in some way. Some or all of the following restrictions are often placed on upper houses:
*Lack of control over the [[executive branch]]. (On the other hand, in the US and many other presidential systems, the Senate or upper chamber has more control over the composition of the Cabinet and the administration generally, through its prerogative of confirming the president's nominations to senior offices.)
*No absolute [[veto]] of proposed legislation, though suspensive vetoes are permitted in some states.
*In countries where it ''can'' veto legislation (such as the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Netherlands]]), it may not be able to amend the proposals.
*A reduced or even absent role in initiating legislation.
*No power to block ''[[loss of supply|supply]]'', or budget measures (a rare example of a Parliamentary upper house that does possess this power is the [[Australian Senate]], which notably [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975|exercised that power in 1975]])

In parliamentary democracies and among European upper houses the [[Italian Senate]] is a notable exception to these general rules, in that it has the same powers as its lower counterpart: any law can be initiated in either house and must be approved in the same form by both houses. Additionally, a Government must have the consent of both to remain in office, a position which is known as "perfect bicameralism" or "equal bicameralism".

The role of a revising chamber is to scrutinise legislation that may have been drafted over-hastily in the lower house and to suggest amendments that the lower house may nevertheless reject if it wishes to. An example is the [[British House of Lords]]. Under the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]], the House of Lords can no longer prevent the passage of most bills, but it must be given an opportunity to debate them and propose amendments, and can thereby delay the passage of a bill with which it disagrees. Bills can only be delayed for up to one year before the [[British House of Commons|Commons]] can use the Parliament Act, although economic bills can only be delayed for one month. It is sometimes seen as having a special role of safeguarding the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]] and important [[civil liberties]] against ill-considered change. The [[British House of Lords]] has a number of ways to block legislation and to reject it, however, the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] can eventually use the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949|Parliament Act]] to force something through. The [[British House of Commons|Commons]] will occasionally bargain and negotiate with the [[British House of Lords|Lords]] such as when the Labour Government of 1999 tried to expel all [[Hereditary Peer]]s from the [[British House of Lords|Lords]], and the [[British House of Lords|Lords]] threatened to wreck the Government's entire legislative agenda and to block every bill which was sent to the chamber. This led to negotiations between [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Viscount Cranborne]] the then Shadow Leader of the House, and the Labour Government which resulted in the Weatherill Amendment to the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] which preserved 92 Hereditary Peers in the house. The Parliament Act is not valid with all legislation and is a very rarely used backup plan.

[[File: House of Lords Chamber.png|thumb|The chamber of the [[House of Lords]], the UK's Upper House]]
Even without a veto, an upper house may defeat legislation. Its opposition may give the lower chamber a chance to reconsider or even abandon a controversial measure. It can also delay a bill so that it does not fit within the legislative schedule, or until a [[general election]] produces a new lower house that no longer wishes to proceed with the bill.

Nevertheless, some states have long retained powerful upper houses. For example, the consent of the upper house to legislation may be necessary (though, as noted above, this seldom extends to budgetary measures). Constitutional arrangements of states with powerful upper houses usually include a means to resolve situations where the two houses are at odds with each other.

In recent times, Parliamentary systems have tended to weaken the powers of upper houses relative to their lower counterparts. Some upper houses have been abolished completely (see below); others have had their powers reduced by constitutional or legislative amendments. Also, [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|conventions]] often exist that the upper house ought not to obstruct the business of government for frivolous or merely partisan reasons. These conventions have tended to harden with a passage of time.

=== Presidential systems ===
In [[presidential system]]s, the upper house is frequently given other powers to compensate for its restrictions:
*Executive appointments, to the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] and other offices, usually require its approval.
*It frequently has the sole authority to give consent to or denounce foreign [[treaty|treaties]].

== Institutional structure ==
There is a variety of ways an upper house's members are assembled: by direct or indirect election, appointment, heredity, or a mixture of these. The [[German Bundesrat]] is composed of members of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinets]] of the German [[states of Germany|states]], in most cases the state [[premier]] and several ministers; they are delegated and can be recalled anytime. In a very similar way, the [[Council of the European Union]] is composed of national ministers.

Many upper houses are not directly elected but appointed: either by the [[head of government]] or in some other way. This is usually intended to produce a house of experts or otherwise distinguished citizens, who would not necessarily be returned in an election. For example, members of the [[Senate of Canada]] are appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]].

In the past, some upper houses had seats that were hereditary, such as in the British [[House of Lords]] until 1999 and in the [[Japanese House of Peers]] until it was abolished in 1947.

It is also common that the upper house consists of delegates chosen by state governments or local officials. Members of the [[Rajya Sabha]] in India are nominated by various states and union territories, while 12 of them are nominated by the [[President of India]]. Similarly, at the state level, one-third of the members of the [[Vidhan Parishad]] are nominated by local governments, one-third by sitting legislators, and the rest are elected by select members of the electorate. The [[United States Senate]] was chosen by the State legislatures until the passage of the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]] in 1913.

The upper house may be directly elected but in different proportions to the lower house - for example, the Senate of [[Australia]] and the [[United States]] have a fixed number of elected members from each state, regardless of the population.

==Abolition==
{{main|List of abolished upper houses}}
Many jurisdictions, such as [[Croatia]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Iran]], [[Mauritania]], [[New Zealand]], [[Peru]], [[Sweden]], [[Turkey]], [[Venezuela]] and many [[States and union territories of India|Indian states]] as well as [[Brazil|Brazilian states]] and [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]], once possessed upper houses but abolished them to adopt [[unicameral]] systems. [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] had a [[Legislative Council]] prior to joining [[Canada]], as did [[Ontario]] when it was [[Upper Canada]] and [[Quebec]] from 1791 (as [[Lower Canada]]) to 1968. [[Nebraska]] is the only state in the United States with a unicameral legislature, having abolished its lower house in 1934.

The [[Australia|Australian]] state of [[Queensland]] also once had an appointed [[Queensland Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] before abolishing it in 1922.  All other Australian states continue to have bicameral systems (the two territories have always been unicameral).

Like Queensland, the [[Germany|German]] [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Bavaria]] had an appointed upper house, the [[Senate of Bavaria]], from 1946 to 1999.

The [[Senate of the Philippines]] was abolished – and restored – twice: from 1935 to 1945 when a unicameral [[National Assembly of the Philippines|National Assembly]] convened, and from 1972 to 1987 when Congress was closed, and later a new constitution was approved instituting a unicameral [[Batasang Pambansa|Parliament]]. The Senate was re-instituted with the restoration of a bicameral Congress via a constitutional amendment in 1941, and via adoption of a new constitution in 1987.

A previous government of Ireland ([[Government of the 31st Dáil|the 31st Dáil]]) promised a national referendum on the abolition of its upper house, the [[Seanad Éireann]], during the 24th Seanad session. By a narrow margin, the Irish public voted to retain it. Conservative-leaning [[Fine Gael]] and Left-leaning [[Sinn Féin]] both supported the abolition, while the centrist [[Fianna Fáil]] was alone among major parties in supporting the retention of the Seanad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24404157|title=Public vote to retain Irish senate|date=5 October 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Uqair Protocol''' or '''Uqair Convention'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/put-it-in-neutral/ Map of boundaries determined by Uqair Protocol]&lt;/ref&gt; was an agreement at [[Uqair]] on 2 December 1922 which defined the boundaries between [[Iraq]] and the [[Sultanate of Nejd]] (modern [[Saudi Arabia]]) and between [[Kuwait]] and Nejd. It was imposed&lt;ref&gt;[http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/php/event.php?eid=156 Imposition of Uqair Protocol]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Percy Cox]], the British [[High Commissioner]] to Iraq, in response to [[Bedouin]] raiders from Nejd under [[ibn Saud]]. Cox met ibn Saud and Major John More, the British Political Agent to Kuwait. The boundaries included a [[Saudi–Iraqi neutral zone]] and a [[Saudi–Kuwaiti neutral zone]].

Kuwait was not permitted any role in outcome of the Uqair agreement when the Saudis and British decided Kuwait's modern boundaries. Kuwait lost more than two thirds of its territory as a result of the agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqMLNJ3tUYMC&amp;pg=PA13|title=The Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and the Economics of the New World Order|author=Mary Ann Tétreault|pages=2–3|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anti-British sentiment grew in Kuwait due to the loss of territory.
