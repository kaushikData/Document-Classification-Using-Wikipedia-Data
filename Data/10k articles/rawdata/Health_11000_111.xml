The '''second cholera pandemic''' (1826–1837), also known as the '''Asiatic Cholera Pandemic''', was a [[Cholera outbreaks and pandemics|cholera pandemic]] that reached from [[India]] across western [[Asia]] to [[Europe]], [[Great Britain]] and [[the Americas]], as well as east to [[China]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Cholera's seven pandemics |url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/05/09/f-cholera-outbreaks.html |work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=December 2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-11 }}&lt;br/&gt;Note: The second pandemic started in India and reached [[Russian Empire|Russia]] by 1830, then spreading into [[Finland]] and Poland. A two-year outbreak began in England in October 1831 and claimed 22,000 lives. Irish immigrants fleeing poverty and the [[Great Potato Famine]], carried the disease from Europe to North America. Soon after the immigrants' arrival in Canada in the summer of 1832, 1,220 people died in Montreal and another 1,000 across Quebec. The disease entered the U.S. via ship traffic through [[Detroit]] and [[New York City]].  Spread by ship passengers, it reached Latin America by 1833. Another outbreak across England and Wales began in 1848, killing 52,000 over two years.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cholera]] caused more deaths, more quickly, than any other epidemic disease in the 19th century.  The medical community now believes cholera to be exclusively a human disease, spread through many means of travel during at the time, and spread through warm fecal-contaminated river waters and contaminated foods. During the second pandemic, the scientific community varied in its beliefs about the causes of cholera.

==History==
===First pandemic===
{{main|First cholera pandemic}}
The first cholera pandemic (1817–24) began near [[Calcutta]] and spread throughout Southeast Asia to the Middle East, eastern Africa and the Mediterranean coast. While [[cholera]] had spread across India many times previously, this outbreak went further; it reached as far as [[China]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] before receding. Hundreds of thousands of people died as a result of this [[pandemic]], including many [[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers, which attracted European attention. This was the first of several cholera pandemics to sweep through Asia and Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries. This first pandemic spread over an unprecedented range of territory, affecting almost every country in Asia.

=== Origins of the second pandemic ===
Historians believe that the first pandemic had lingered in Indonesia and the Philippines in 1830.

Although not much is known about the journey of the cholera pandemic in east India, many believe that this pandemic began, like the first, with outbreaks along the [[Ganges Delta]] in India. From there the disease spread along trade routes to cover most of India. By 1828 the disease had traveled to China. Cholera was also reported in China in 1826 and 1835, and in Japan in 1831. In 1829, Iran was apparently infected with cholera from Afghanistan.

Cholera reached the southern tips of the [[Ural Mountains]] in 1829. On 26 August 1829 the first cholera case was recorded in [[Orenburg]] with reports of outbreaks in [[Bugulma]] (7 November), [[Buguruslan]] (5 December), [[Menselinsk]] (2 January 1830) and [[Belebeevsk]] (6 January). With 3500 cases including 865 fatal ones in [[Orenburg]] province, the epidemic stopped by February 1830.&lt;ref name="Henze2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charlotte E. Henze|title=Disease, Health Care and Government in Late Imperial Russia: Life and Death on the Volga, 1823-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wsQCkIpFy7IC&amp;pg=PA13|date=15 December 2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-83397-1|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It swept across Europe for the first time during the second pandemic and reached as far west as the [[Caspian Sea]].

=== 1830s ===

The second cholera pandemic spread from India to Russia and then to the rest of Europe, claiming hundreds of thousands of lives.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=J. N.

By 1831 the epidemic had infiltrated Russia's main cities and towns. Russian soldiers brought the disease to Poland in February 1831. There were a reported 250,000 cases of cholera in Russia and 100,000 deaths.

The cholera epidemic struck Warsaw during the [[Polish–Russian War 1830–31]] between 16 May and 20 August 1831; 4,734 people fell ill and 2,524 died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Raymond Durand |editor=Robert Bielecki |others= |title=Depesze z powstańczej Warszawy 1830–1831: raporty konsula francuskiego w Królestwie Polskim |trans-title=Memoranda from Warsaw during the Uprising 1830–1831: reports of the French consul to the Kingdom of Poland |url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1980 |publisher=Czytelnik |location=Warsaw |isbn=978-83-07-00254-5 |oclc=7732541 |authorlink1=Louis Marie Raymond Durand }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The epidemic of [[cholera]] brought to Poland and [[East Prussia]] by Russian soldiers forced [[Prussia|Prussian authorities]] to close their borders to Russian transports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Tomasz Strzeżek |author2= |editor=Kornelia Kompanowska |others= |title=Warszawa 1831|trans-title=Warsaw 1831|url= |edition= |volume= |year=1998 |publisher=[[Dom Wydawniczy Bellona]] |location=Warsaw |isbn=978-83-11-08793-4 |series=Historyczne Bitwy | pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Cholera Riots]]" occurred in Russia, caused by the anti-cholera measures undertaken by the [[tsarist]] government.

By early 1831, frequent reports of the spread of the pandemic in Russia prompted the British government to issue quarantine orders for ships sailing from Russia to British ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=18807 |date=27 May 1831|page=1027}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late summer, with the disease appearing more likely to spread to Britain, its Board of Health, in accordance with the prevailing [[miasma theory]], issued orders recommending as a preventive the burning of  "decayed articles, such as rags, cordage, papers, old clothes, hangings...filth of every description removed, clothing and furniture should be submitted to copious effusions of water, and boiled in a strong ley; drains and privies thoroughly cleansed by streams of water and chloride of lime...free and continued admission of fresh air to all parts of the house and furniture should be enjoined for at least a week".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=18863 |date=21 October 1831|page=2160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the reports of two English doctors who had observed the epidemic in [[St. Petersburg]], the Board of Health published a detailed description of the disease's symptoms and onset:

{{Quotation|''Giddiness, sick stomach, nervous agitation, intermittent, slow, or small pulse, cramps beginning at the tops of the fingers and toes, and rapidly approaching the trunk, give the first warning. Vomiting or purging, or both these evacuations of a liquid like rice-Water or whey, or barley-water, come on ; the features become sharp and contracted, the eye sinks, the look is expressive of terror and wildness;  the lips, face, neck, hands, and feet, and soon after the thighs, arms, and whole surface assume a leaden, blue, purple, black, or deep brown tint according to the complexion of the individual, varying in shade with the intensity of the attack. The fingers and toes are reduced in size, the skin and soft parts covering them are wrinkled, shrivelled and folded.  The nails put on a bluish pearly white; the larger superficial veins are marked by flat lines of a deeper black; the pulse becomes either small as a thread, and scarcely vibrating, or else totally extinct.''

''The skin is deadly cold and often damp, the tongue always moist, often white and loaded, but flabby and chilled like a piece of dead flesh. The voice is nearly gone; the respiration quick, irregular, and imperfectly performed. The patient speaks in a whisper. He struggles for breath, and often lays his hand on his heart to point out the seat of his distress. Sometimes there are rigid spasms of the legs, thighs, and loins. The secretion of urine is totally suspended; vomiting and purgings, which are far from being the most important or dangerous symptoms, and which in a very great number of cases of the disease, have not been profuse, or have been arrested by medicine early in the attack, succeed. It is evident that the most urgent and peculiar symptom of this disease is the sudden depression of the vital powers: proved by the diminished action of the heart, the coldness of the surface and extremities, and the stagnant state of the whole circulation.''&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=18863 |date=21 October 1831|page=2159}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The epidemic reached Great Britain in December 1831: appearing in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], where it was carried by passengers on a ship from the Baltic. It also appeared in [[Gateshead]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. In London, the disease claimed 6,536 victims; in Paris, 20,000 died (out of a population of 650,000), with about 100,000 deaths in all of France.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cholera Years: The United States in 1832, 1849, and 1866 |first=Charles E. |last=Rosenberg |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=1987 |isbn=0-226-72677-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1832 the epidemic reached [[Quebec, Canada|Quebec]], [[Ontario, Canada|Ontario]], and [[Nova Scotia, Canada|Nova Scotia]], Canada; and [[Detroit]] and [[New York City]] in the United States.  It reached the Pacific coast of North America between 1832 and 1834.&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt; The pandemic prompted the passage of the landmark Public Health Act and the Nuisances Removal Act in 1848 in England.

In mid-1832, 57 [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants died who had been laying a stretch of railroad called [[Duffy's Cut]], 30 miles west of Philadelphia. They had all contracted cholera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Ghosts of Duffy's Cut |year=2006 |publisher=[[Praeger Publishers]] |quote=In the summer of 1832, Irish immigrant Philip Duffy contracted 57 of his newly arrived countrymen to lay a stretch of railroad some 30 miles west of Philadelphia.

=== Third pandemic ===
{{Main|Third cholera pandemic}}
The third cholera pandemic (1846–60) was the third major outbreak of [[cholera]] originating in India in the nineteenth century that reached far beyond its borders, which researchers at [[UCLA]] believe may have started as early as 1837 and lasted until 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/pancholera3.html|title=Asiatic Cholera Pandemics During the Life of John Snow : Asiatic Cholera Pandemic of 1846-63|last=Frerichs|first=Ralph R.|date=|website=John Snow - a historical giant in epidemiology|publisher=UCLA Department of Epidemiology - Fielding School of Public Health|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Russia, more than one million people died of cholera.  In 1853–54, the epidemic in London claimed over 10,000 lives, and there were 23,000 deaths for all of Great Britain.  This pandemic was considered to have the highest fatalities of the 19th-century epidemics.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/05/09/f-cholera-outbreaks.html|title=Cholera's seven pandemics|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216071746/http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/05/09/f-cholera-outbreaks.html|archivedate=16 December 2008|deadurl=yes|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the earlier pandemics, cholera spread from the Ganges delta of India. It had high fatalities among populations in Asia, Europe, Africa and North America. In 1854, which was considered the worst year, 23,000 people died in Great Britain.

== Causes ==
During the second pandemic, the scientific community varied in its beliefs about the causes of cholera. In France doctors believed cholera was associated with the poverty of certain communities or poor environment. Russians believed the disease was contagious, although doctors did not understand how it spread. The United States believed that cholera was brought by recent immigrants, specifically the Irish, and epidemiologists understand they were carrying disease from British ports. Lastly, some British thought the disease might rise from divine intervention.&lt;ref name="Hayes 2005 214–219"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes|first=J.N.|title=Epidemics and Pandemics: Their Impacts on Human History|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=214–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Image:Cholera 395.1.jpg|thumb|Hand bill from the [[Metropolitan Board of Health|New York City Board of Health]], 1832. The outdated public health advice demonstrates the lack of understanding of the disease and its causes.]]
Norwegian poet [[Henrik Wergeland]] wrote a stage-play inspired by the pandemic, which had reached [[Norway]]. In ''The Indian Cholera'', he criticized [[British Empire|British colonialism]] for spreading the pandemic.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

As a result of the epidemic, the medical community developed a major advance, the intravenous [[Fluid replacement|saline drip]].  It was developed from the work of [[Dr Thomas Latta]] of [[Leith]], near [[Edinburgh]]. Latta established from blood studies that a saline drip greatly improved the condition of patients and saved many lives by preventing dehydration.  But, he was one of the many medical personnel who died in the epidemic.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In general, the [[United States]] alone experiences 1 million cases of [[salmonellosis]] per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salmonella Fast Facts|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/28/health/salmonella-fast-facts/|work=CNN Health|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, although there are around 100,000 incidents of salmonellosis reported annually, there has been a steady decrease in cases over the past four years.&lt;ref name=knowsalmonella&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Health|url=http://www.knowsalmonella.com/en/foodsafety.html|publisher=KnowSalmonella|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact number of those infected is impossible to know as not all cases are reported. Of these reported cases, some can be classified as [[foodborne disease]] [[outbreak]]s by the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) if "two or more people get the same illness from the same contaminated food or drink"&lt;ref name="outbreak definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Selected Multistate Foodborne Outbreak Investigations|url=https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/outbreaks/multistate-outbreaks/outbreaks-list.html|publisher=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[zoonotic]] outbreaks if "two or more people get the same illness from the same pet or other animal".&lt;ref name="zoonotic def"&gt;{{cite web|title=Selected Multistate Outbreak Investigations Linked to Animals and Animal Products|url=https://www.cdc.gov/zoonotic/gi/outbreaks.html|publisher=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the various strains or [[serotypes]] of the ''[[Salmonella]]'' bacteria, related to the outbreaks in the United States, infected over 1800 people and killed seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reports of Salmonella Outbreak Investigations from 2012|url=https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/outbreaks-2012.html|work=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported 91,034 cases of ''Salmonella'' infection with 65,317 cases related to the 2012 outbreaks.&lt;ref name=ecdc /&gt; Of those 65,317 cases, there were 61 deaths.&lt;ref name=ecdc&gt;{{cite journal|title=The European Union Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic Agents and Food-borne Outbreaks in 2012|journal=EFSA Journal|date=2014|volume=12|issue=2|pages=20–98|url=http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/publications/eu-summary-report-zoonoses-food-borne-outbreaks-2012.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2014|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2014.3547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of outbreak ==
The 2012 outbreak did not have one start and end date due to the multivariate origination sites and stages of investigation. Each outbreak followed its own pattern of contamination, spread, infection, and containment throughout the course of 2012. Worldwide, there were 15 different foodborne and zoonotic origins of the ''Salmonella'' outbreaks.&lt;ref name="outbreak definition" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ecdc /&gt; Eighteen of the over 2,300 strains of ''Salmonella'' were found in infected humans and contaminated products in Europe and the U.S.&lt;ref name=ecdc /&gt; As with all diseases, there were certain places and serotypes that contributed more to the magnitude of the 2012 outbreak. As such, the origins listed below had the greatest frequency of occurrence and overall impact on society.

=== Hedgehogs ===
''S''. Typhimurium has traditionally been an uncommon serotype of ''Salmonella''; however, beginning in January 2012 through the end of 2012, the number of cases steadily rose, with 18 human cases in the United States alone (spread among eight states).&lt;ref name="hedge" /&gt; The infection caused one death and four hospitalizations.&lt;ref name="hedge" /&gt; These infections stem from contact with pet hedgehogs or with the animals' surroundings.&lt;ref name=hedge /&gt;  No one pet provider was linked to the infected hedgehogs.&lt;ref name="hedge"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsden-Haug|first=N|author2=Meyer S |author3=Anderson T |title=Multistate Outbreak of Human Salmonella Typhimurium Infections Linked to Contact with Pet Hedgehogs -- United States, 2011-2013|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|date=February 2013|volume=62|issue=4|pages=73|url=http://libezp.lib.lsu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=85931227&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=6 March 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feeder rodents ===
One epidemic of ''Salmonella enterica'' I 4,5,12:i:- in the United States in February 2012 affected 46 people across 22 states.&lt;ref name=rodents /&gt; The outbreak seemed to be linked to the handling of live or frozen feeder mice and rats for reptile and amphibian pets.&lt;ref name="rodents"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sweat D|author2=Valiani A |author3=Jackson B |title=Infections with Salmonella I 4,[5],12:I:- Linked to Exposure to Feeder Rodents -- United States, August 2011-February 2012|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|date=April 20, 2012|volume=61|issue=15|pages=277|url=http://libezp.lib.lsu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=76504559&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=6 March 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar outbreak occurred in the United States and United Kingdom in 2009 and 2010 from the same two breeders implicated in this 2012 occurrence.&lt;ref name=rodents /&gt;

The outbreaks in 2012 that occurred due to contact with live poultry were of five different serotypes of ''Salmonella'' bacteria originating in three distinct locations. The first infections were reported in February 2012.&lt;ref name="poultry 2" /&gt; Spanning 23 states, there were 93 humans infected with the Montevideo serotype of ''Salmonella''.&lt;ref name="poultry 2" /&gt; All were infected with this strain from contact with baby ducklings or chicks from the [http://www.esteshatchery.com/ Estes Hatchery] located in Springfield, Missouri.&lt;ref name="poultry 2" /&gt; This outbreak resulted in one casualty.&lt;ref name="poultry 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Multistate Outbreak of Human Salmonella Montevideo Infections Linked to Live Poultry in Backyard Flocks (Final Update)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/montevideo-06-12/index.html|work=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One month later (March 2012), 46 people in the United States were infected with ''Salmonella'' Hadar through contact with live poultry.&lt;ref name="poultry 1" /&gt; There were no deaths, and the infected humans were located in 11 different states.&lt;ref name="poultry 1" /&gt; The specific hatchery name is withheld, but it was concluded by the CDC that this strain of ''Salmonella'' originated in one unnamed hatchery in Idaho.&lt;ref name="poultry 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Multistate Outbreak of Human Salmonella Hadar Infections Linked to Live Poultry in Backyard Flocks (Final Update)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/hadar-live-poultry-07-12/index.html|work=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same month, one of three strains of ''Salmonella'' – Infantis, Newport, or Lille – were contracted by 195 people from contact with live poultry (whether for purposes of agriculture or pet keeping).&lt;ref name="poultry 3" /&gt; Of those infected, two died from infection.&lt;ref name="poultry 3" /&gt;  This particular outbreak, though stemming from only the Mt. Healthy Hatchery in Ohio, expanded across 27 states.&lt;ref name="poultry 3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Multistate Outbreak of Human Salmonella Infections Linked to Live Poultry in Backyard Flocks (Final Update)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/live-poultry-05-12/index.html|work=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Small turtles ===
First investigated at the end of March 2012, there were a total of 84 cases of infected humans across 15 states of the United States by November 2012.&lt;ref name="turtles" /&gt; These people's salmonellosis (either from ''Salmonella'' Sandiego or ''Salmonella'' Newport) stemmed from contact with small turtles or their habitats.&lt;ref name=turtles /&gt; Some of these turtles were purchased from street merchants.&lt;ref name=turtles /&gt; No one source of the ''Salmonella'' contaminations was identified, and no human deaths occurred.&lt;ref name="turtles" /&gt; Due to past outbreaks, there is a law in place making it illegal to sell or own a turtle with a shell length less than four inches, as these seem to generally be the sources of most ''Salmonella'' bacteria in small turtles.&lt;ref name="turtles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eight Multistate Outbreaks of Human Salmonella Infections Linked to Small Turtles (Final Update)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/small-turtles-03-12/index.html|work=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Raw scraped ground tuna product ===
First reported in April 2012, an outbreak of salmonellosis caused by rarer serotypes, ''Salmonella'' Bareilly and ''Salmonella'' Nchanga, was reported in 28 states, mostly in the Eastern U.S., having caused no deaths, but 425 cases of illness and 55 hospitalizations.&lt;ref name="tuna" /&gt; This outbreak was linked to the consumption of raw scraped ground tuna product.&lt;ref name=tuna /&gt; The source was frozen raw yellowfin tuna product aka Nakaochi Scrape manufactured by Moon Marine USA Corporation.&lt;ref name="tuna" /&gt; This product was voluntarily recalled after the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] discovered strains of ''Salmonella'' in the packages.&lt;ref name=tuna /&gt; The company eventually recalled another type of canned tuna for fear it may have been contaminated, too.&lt;ref name=tuna /&gt; This outbreak was significant in that it was the first salmonellosis case in the United States connected to raw, scraped tuna products, as well as being the first time ''S''. Nchanga was discovered in food products in the United States.&lt;ref name=tuna&gt;{{cite web|title=Multistate Outbreak of Salmonella Bareilly and Salmonella Nchanga Infections Associated with a Raw Scraped Ground Tuna Product (Final Update)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/bareilly-04-12/index.html|publisher=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smoked salmon ===
In July 2012, an outbreak of salmonellosis occurred in the Netherlands and the United States.&lt;ref name=neth3 /&gt;  According to the [[Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment|National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]], by the end of 2012, 1060 people in the Netherlands and 100 in the United States contracted salmonellosis from smoked salmon infected with ''Salmonella'' Thompson.&lt;ref name="rivm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Salmonella besmetting neemt verder af|url=http://www.rivm.nl/Bibliotheek/Algemeen_Actueel/Nieuwsberichten/2012/Salmonella_besmetting_neemt_verder_af|publisher=Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nethnews2&gt;{{cite news|title=Salmonella in U.S. and Netherlands from Smoked Salmon|url=http://www.healthaim.com/salmonella-in-u-s-and-netherlands-from-smoked-fish|accessdate=1 April 2014|newspaper=HealthAIM|date=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2, the [[RIVM]] confirmed that there were 4 deaths and over 1060 cases linked to ''S''.

== Presence in agriculture ==

=== Contamination through defecation ===
Because animals are the main transporters of ''Salmonella'', crops can become infected. This generally occurs because of the use of manure-based fertilizers on farms. Some animals do not appear sick (especially infected poultry); however, they carry the ''Salmonella'' in their intestines and when they defecate, the bacteria spreads to the soil.&lt;ref name=ecdc /&gt; Sometimes, the sick animals manifest the illness in ways similar to humans with similar consequences. They may have diarrhea, fever, and then die if they are not treated.&lt;ref name=ecdc /&gt; After their death, the other animals raised with them can become infected through contact with their feces.&lt;ref name=ecdc /&gt;  Therefore, if this infected manure is used as a fertilizer for crops, then the crops will contain trace amounts of infectious ''Salmonella'' bacteria that can spread to humans after the crops are harvested.&lt;ref name=ecdc /&gt;

Poultry can become infected by living close together in hatcheries, where multiple animals are defecating. Some poultry are hatched to be sold domestically, while others are hatched for production to be consumed later. If live poultry are infected and sold domestically, they can infect other animals who may be around them in a domestic situation e.g. other pets.&lt;ref name="poultry 1" /&gt; Because poultry do not show symptoms, infections are usually not obvious until humans or other animals in contact with the poultry become ill.&lt;ref name=ecdc /&gt;

=== Tomatoes ===
[[File:No Tomatoes.jpg|thumb|Notice of lack of tomatoes due to ''Salmonella'' outbreak in 2012]]
East Coast tomatoes tend to have higher rates of ''Salmonella'' infection than West Coast tomatoes.&lt;ref name="tomato bacteria" /&gt; This seems to be due to the [[microbiome]] of the East Coast of the United States, where there are far less soil bacteria that destroy ''Salmonella'' versus the microbiome of the West Coast where these bacteria are abundant.&lt;ref name="tomato bacteria" /&gt;  Because of the anti-salmonella bacteria limiting its spread, fewer people on the West Coast report cases of salmonellosis.&lt;ref name="tomato bacteria"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conniff|first=Richard|title=Enlisting bacteria and fungi from the soil to support crop plants is a promising alternative to the heavy use of fertilizer and pesticides|journal=Scientific American|date=September 2013|volume=309|issue=3|pages=76–79|url=http://libezp.lib.lsu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=89931696&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, street-sold natural tomatoes have been consistently tied to outbreaks of ''Salmonella''. Street-sold (unregulated) items are independently produced and sold to consumers. This does not include fresh produce markets. These strong links to salmonellosis is in due in part do the lack of [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) oversight on unregistered vendors. Another cause of ''Salmonella'' bacteria growth may be due to contact with contaminated irrigation water.&lt;ref name="tomato bacteria" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tomato article" /&gt; The tomatoes (or any plant) are much more likely to become infected if the soil in which the roots are located are contaminated or if the actual blossom is contaminated.&lt;ref name="tomato bacteria" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tomato article" /&gt; These two entry points lead to the most likely scenarios in which a healthy tomato plant may become infected with some serotype of ''Salmonella''.&lt;ref name="tomato article"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Jie|title=Colonization and Internalization of Salmonella Enterica in Tomato Plants|journal=American Society for Microbiology|date=April 2013|volume=79|issue=8|pages=2494–2502|url=http://aem.asm.org/content/79/8/2494.full.pdf+html|accessdate=6 March 2014|doi=10.1128/aem.03704-12|display-authors=etal|pmc=3623171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== End of 2012 outbreak and future prevention ==
[[File:Prevention of Salmonella from the farm to table infographic.png|thumb|An infographic illustrating prevention methods to reduce ''Salmonella'' contamination in many scenarios]]
The various outbreaks of ''Salmonella'' serotypes in the U.S. and abroad began at different points either in late 2011 or early 2012; however, all cases were concluded at the end of 2012. Those who were infected either suffered through the symptoms or expired from ''Salmonella''{{'}}s destruction to their immune system.&lt;ref name="outbreak definition" /&gt; If there was a specific point of origin for an outbreak, a recall of the product helped to decrease more possible exposure. None of the people infected showed symptoms or maintained symptoms into 2013. This biotic disturbance had a major impact on society. It increased awareness about the ease in which bacteria spread among organisms. It helped to prompt researchers to look into ways to prevent crops from becoming contaminated in the field. Most importantly, this disturbance has been occurring with increasing frequency, which seems counter-intuitive because salmonellosis is an easily preventable disease; if simple [[food safety]] steps were taken, unnecessary hospitalizations and deaths could have been eliminated in 2012. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://simplewag.com/| title=healthy pet treats  }} Wednesday, 11 January 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

In order to prevent serious outbreaks similar to the one in 2012 in the future, some precautions must be taken. When handling food, one must be careful not to [[Cross contamination|cross-contaminate]] raw poultry products or other meats with other foods.&lt;ref name="salmonella survival" /&gt; Anyone handling food should also be sure to wash their hands frequently.&lt;ref name="salmonella survival" /&gt; All persons should wash their hands after using the restroom as bacteria can survive for long periods of time outside of the body and the bacteria will be spread from the unwashed hands to possible food items or anything that may enter the mouth area.&lt;ref name="salmonella survival"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Salmonella Survival on Pecans as Influenced by Processing and Storage Conditions | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | date = June 1975 | first = L.

Recent outbreaks have occurred, and although not all infections can be eliminated, most can be hindered either through coating crops with ''Salmonella''-fighting bacteria&lt;ref name="tomato article" /&gt;  or through human precautions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3489">'''Aidan de Brune''' (17 July 1874 – 15 February 1946), [[journalist]], [[author]], [[pedestrian]] was the first person to walk around the perimeter of [[Australia]], unaccompanied and unassisted.&lt;ref name="tat"&gt;[http://gutenberg.net.au/amateur-tramp/The%20Amateur%20Tramp-3-cc.pdf The Amateur Tramp: a Walk of Ten Thousand Miles Around Australia] by Colin Choat, pp. 15-28. {{ISBN|978-0-646-98937-2}}. Accessed 8 November 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Brune was born Herbert Charles Cull in [[London]],[[England]] and started his professional life as a [[printer (publishing)|printer]]. He married Ethel Elizabeth Crofts in 1907 and a son, Lionel, was born in 1909.&lt;ref name="tat" /&gt;

In 1910 Cull went to [[Australia]] and arrived in [[Fremantle, Western Australia]] on 23 May 1910. His wife and child followed him and arrived in [[Albany, Western Australia]] on 26 November 1910.&lt;ref name="tat" /&gt;

In 1912 Cull's wife and son returned to England. Cull remained in Australia for the rest of his life. In early 1920 he was working for the ''Bunbury Herald'' newspaper and wrote two serial stories: ''The Pursuits of Mr Peter Pell'' and ''The Mystery of the Nine Stars.'' The latter story was unfinished when, in November 1920, Cull left the newspaper and began to walk from Fremantle to [[Sydney]], following the [[Trans-Australian Railway]]. When he reached Sydney, in early 1921, Cull was calling himself Aidan de Brune.&lt;ref name="tat" /&gt;

In September 1921 he began a walk around the perimeter of Australia, from Sydney to Sydney, anticlockwise. De Brune described his goal to be "to leave Sydney on foot, to walk ten thousand miles (more or less) around Australia, calling at all the ports en route on the four coasts, and to return to Sydney."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article207313599 A Stroll Around Australia], ''The Moora Herald and Midland Districts Advocate'', 8 June 1923. Accessed 8 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed taking twelve months to complete the walk. However, in the event, he took two and a half years, arriving back in Sydney on 4 March 1924.

De Brune kept a diary during his walk, in which he made daily entries detailing the distance walked each day and the total distance to-date. He also invited people he met along the way to certify his presence at the location he was at and to make comments. After he finished his walk he donated the diary&lt;ref&gt;"Aidan Charles Francis De Brune trek round Australia, 20 September 1921 – 1 September 1924." [[State Library of New South Wales]], Call No. B 692.&lt;/ref&gt; and a typescript of the contents of the diary&lt;ref&gt;"Record diary of a walk around Australia." [https://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/research-and-collections State Library of New South Wales], Dewey: 980.1/D&lt;/ref&gt; to the [https://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/research-and-collections State Library of New South Wales].

After his walk, Aidan de Brune settled in Sydney and began writing serialised mystery stories for newspapers.

Herbert Charles Cull died on 15 February 1946. His death was registered as that of Aidan de Brune. He was buried in [[Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park|Botany Cemetery]].

At the time of his disappearance he had climbed 10 out of the 14 [[eight-thousander]]s, all without supplementary oxygen. Up to date, this achievement makes him the Bulgarian altitude climber with the highest number of successful ascents of peaks over 8000 meters.

'''Calcium carbimide''', sold as the [[citrate]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] under the trade name '''Temposil''', is a [[disulfiram-like drug]]. Its effects are similar to the drug [[disulfiram]] (Antabuse) in that it interferes with the normal metabolism of alcohol by preventing the breakdown of the metabolic byproduct [[acetaldehyde]]. The result is that when alcohol is consumed by users of calcium carbimide, they experience severe reactions which include symptoms such as sweating, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, rash, nausea and vomiting, and headache.

A recent 9-year study found that incorporation of supervised carbimide and the similar drug, disulfiram, into a comprehensive treatment program resulted in an abstinence rate of over 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krampe H, Stawicki S, Wagner T |title=Follow-up of 180 alcoholic patients for up to 7 years after outpatient treatment: impact of alcohol deterrents on outcome |journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=86–95 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16433735 |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2006.00013.x |url= |issn=0145-6008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Calix Society''' is an organization in the United States founded in the 1940s which aims at addressing the particular spiritual needs of [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] recovering from [[alcoholism|alcohol addiction]]. It affiliates closely with [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], and believes in the effectiveness of the [[twelve-step program]], but focuses on enabling Catholics who may have abandoned or neglected their faith during active alcoholism to return and have the fellowship of other Catholics in recovery. It promotes total abstinence for those in recovery, taking inspiration from [[Matt Talbot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul VI|author-link=Pope Paul VI|title=Address of the Holy Father Paul VI to the members of the Calix Society|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/speeches/1974/documents/hf_p-vi_spe_19740511_abuso-alcool_en.html|publisher=Vatican|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is concerned with the spiritual development and the sanctification of the whole personality of its members. The organization's motto is "substituting the cup that stupifies for the cup that sanctifies". The group has expanded since the 1940s to have active groups in 19 US states and in the UK.&lt;ref name=Calix&gt;{{cite web|title=Calix Society official website|url=http://calixsociety.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cannabis in Austria''' is legal for [[science|scientific]] and [[medicine|medical]] usage, but illegal for recreational usage. Possession of small amounts for personal use was decriminalized in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salzburg24.at/legalisierung-light-cannabis-in-kleinstmengen-quasi-straffrei/4517780&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of cannabis seeds and plants is legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sensiseeds.com/en/blog/legal-status-of-cannabis-in-austria/|title=Legal status of cannabis in Austria|publisher=Sensi Seeds|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical cannabis==
On 9 July 2008, the Austrian Parliament approved [[cannabis cultivation]] for scientific and medical uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gMXaMnzKEu6FxfDVlCHd4xMcmEbg |title=AFP: Austria allows cannabis for medical purposes |publisher=afp.google.com |accessdate=2008-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905104155/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gMXaMnzKEu6FxfDVlCHd4xMcmEbg# |archive-date=2008-09-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannabis cultivation is controlled by the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (''Österreichische Agentur für Gesundheit und Ernährungssicherheit, AGES'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=19 December 2008 |title=Änderung des Suchtmittelgesetzes – SMG |journal=Bundesgesetzblatt für die Republik Österreich |publisher=Österreichischer Bundesverlag |location=Vienna |language=german |url=http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/BgblAuth/BGBLA_2008_I_143/BGBLA_2008_I_143.pdf |accessdate=2009-07-30 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decriminalization==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4710">'''Capital punishment''' has been practiced in '''Kenya''' since before [[Kenya#History#Independent Kenya (1963)|independence]] and is still provided for under Kenyan law. No executions have been carried out in Kenya since 1987,&lt;ref name="nation-ag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Death-Penalty-Capital-Punishment-Githu-Muigai/-/1056/2671018/-/fbucrf/-/index.html|title=Plan on to remove death penalty: AG|date=30 March 2015|work=nation.co.ke}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Hezekiah Ochuka]] and Pancras Oteyo Okumu were [[hanging|hanged]] for [[treason]].&lt;ref name="knchr"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.knchr.org/Portals/0/CivilAndPoliticalReports/PP2%20-%20Abolition%20of%20the%20death%20penalty%20-%20final.pdf | title=Kenya National Commission On Human Rights - Abolition Of The Death Penalty In Kenya | work=Kenya National Commission On Human Rights | accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Kenya commuted all death sentences to life imprisonment, impacting over 4000 death row inmates. The move was made to compel these prisoners to work, something condemned men are exempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8181864.stm|title=BBC News - Kenya empties its death-row cells|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the lack of executions, [[death sentence]]s are still passed in Kenya. In July 2013, Ali Babitu Kololo was sentenced to death for his role in the murder and kidnapping of two British tourists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23497627|title=David and Judith Tebbutt: Kenya imposes death sentence|date=2013-07-29|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014 a nurse received a death sentence after being convicted of carrying out an [[abortion]] on a woman who subsequently died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-29370405|title=Kenyan nurse gets death penalty for abortion|date=2014-09-25|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Capital punishment was introduced in Kenya in 1893 by the colonial government; the practice was uncommon in pre-colonial communities, which placed a high value on human life.&lt;ref name="standard-cp"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000126707/origin-and-history-of-death-penalty-in-kenya | title=Origin and history of death penalty in Kenya | work=The Standard | date=2 July 2014 | accessdate=8 November 2016 | author=Gisesa, Nyambega}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, most African communities did not impose a death sentence on an individual unless as a last resort for an offender who had repeatedly "made themselves dangerous beyond the limits of endurance of their fellows".&lt;ref name="murder-and-mercy"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=23267172 | title=Murder and Mercy: Capital Punishment in Colonial Kenya, ca. 1909—1956 | author=Hynd, Stacey | journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies | year=2012 | volume=45 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Penal Code as created by the British required a mandatory death penalty for [[murder]], [[treason]] and [[armed robbery]]. Numerous executions, documented as 1,090 in number, were carried out by the British colonial government during the [[Mau Mau Uprising]].&lt;ref name="murder-and-mercy" /&gt;

After [[1982 Kenyan coup d'état attempt|the 1982 coup d'état attempt]], [[Hezekiah Ochuka]], Pancras Oteyo Okumu and two other masterminds of the coup were convicted of treason, sentenced to death and consequently hanged. They were the last people executed in Kenya to date.&lt;ref name="standard-cp" /&gt;

In 2010, the [[Court of Appeal of Kenya|Court of Appeal]] repealed the mandatory death sentence for murder in ''[[Mutiso v. Republic]]'', the third national court in common-law Africa to do so.&lt;ref name="suffolk"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Constitutional reform and the abolition of the mandatory death penalty in Kenya. | author=Novak, Andrew | journal=Suffolk University Law Review | year=2012 | volume=45 | issue=2 | pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, President [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] commuted the death sentences of 2747 inmates on death row to life imprisonment, as was done by President [[Mwai Kibaki]] 7 years previously, where he commuted the sentences of 4000 inmates on death row to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="independent-cp"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/kenya-death-row-inmates-spare-live-commute-sentence-a7378751.html | title=Kenya commutes sentences of all death row inmates | work=The Independent | date=25 October 2016 | accessdate=20 November 2016 | author=Payton, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chartered Institute of Environmental Health''' ('''CIEH''') is a professional membership body concerned with [[environmental health]] and promoting standards in the training and education of environmental health professionals.

== History ==
The history of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health can be traced back to 1883 when the original organisation was founded and called the Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cieh.org/about_us/history.html CIEH: About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laverack|first1=Glenn|title=A-Z of Public Health|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1137426179|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the then Institute of Environmental Health Officers was granted a Royal Charter, a deed giving it special powers, rights and privileges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017-09-18-Record-of-Charters-Granted.xls.xlsx Privy Council: Record of Royal Charters awarded]&lt;/ref&gt; It became subject to scrutiny by the Privy Council and spent the next ten years taking additional steps to ensure the professional standards of its membership. This resulted in permission being given in 1994 for the organisation to reflect its chartered status through a change in its name to Chartered Institute of Environmental Health.

The Royal Charter states that the objects of CIEH are: 'to promote for the public benefit the theory and science of environmental health in all its aspects and to disseminate knowledge about environmental health.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cieh.org/about_us/regulations.html CIEH: Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
CIEH is based in the UK with approximately 8,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cieh.org/uploadedFiles/Furniture/membership/Membership_2018/Renewals%20Brochure%202018.pdf CIEH 2018 renewal brochure]&lt;/ref&gt; members worldwide; the majority being based in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

CIEH’s head office is Chadwick Court (named after [[Edwin Chadwick]]), in Southwark, London, with additional offices in Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cieh.org/about_us/contact.html CIEH: Contact us]&lt;/ref&gt;

It also provides a range of professional qualifications and work-based learning&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cieh.org/training.html&lt;/ref&gt; including eLearning,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cieh-elearning.com/&lt;/ref&gt; corporate training&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cieh.org/corporate-solutions.html&lt;/ref&gt; and consultancy services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cieh.org/corporate-solutions/consultancy.html&lt;/ref&gt; CIEH’s qualification portfolio includes [[food safety]], [[Occupational safety and health|health and safety]], [[first aid]], [[fire safety]] and [[environmental protection]].

CIEH also works with organisations in the private, public and charity sectors, helping them comply with legal requirements and best practice, as well as offering training for their employees.

==Membership==
CIEH offers four grades of membership: Affiliate; Associate; Member and Fellow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cieh.org/members/become-a-member.html Membership grades web page by CIEH]&lt;/ref&gt;

Members get access to news, regional networks, special interest groups and a range of other benefits.

==Chartered Environmental Health Practitioner==

Since 2003 CIEH has awarded the status of Chartered Environmental Health Practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cieh.org/professional_development/chartered_status.html Chartered Environmental Health Practitioner web page by CIEH]&lt;/ref&gt; Chartered status can be obtained only by Members with five years of work experience as a qualified EHP, 60 hours of CPD accumulated within the last three years as well as passing the Chartered Status Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cieh.org/professional_development/chartered_status.html CIEH: Chartered Status]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chartered Environmental Health Practitioners may use the post-nominal letters CEnvH and can gain entry to the Occupational Safety and Health Consultants Register ([[OSHCR]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oshcr.org/about/#ProfessionalBodies OSHCR: Professional Bodies]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[drug development]], a '''covered clinical study''' refers to a [[clinical study]], submitted to the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) as part of a marketing application (for example, as part of an [[new drug application|NDA]] or [[510(k)]]), about which the FDA may require disclosure of financial interest of the [[clinical investigator]] in the outcome of the study. For example, the applicant must disclose whether an investigator owns equity in the sponsor, or owns proprietary interest in the product under investigation.

The FDA defines a covered study as "...any study of a drug, biological product or device in humans submitted in a marketing application or reclassification petition that the applicant or FDA relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product) or any study in which a single investigator makes a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.fda.gov/oc/guidance/financialdis.html|title=Guidance for Industry: Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|date=March 20, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32161">Americans with disabilities are one of the largest [[minority group|minority]] groups in the [[United States]]. Although the US does not have [[universal healthcare]], Americans with disabilities can generally find adequate levels of subsidized support from a variety of sources, generally at the regional level. While most rural areas&amp;nbsp;— especially in the [[Great Plains]] region&amp;nbsp;— have little or no government-organized medical support infrastructure for the permanently disabled indigent population, most major urban centers have healthcare systems. The rights of Americans with disabilities are protected by the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]].

==Demographics==
According to the ''Disability Status: 2000 - Census 2000 Brief'' approximately 20% of Americans have one or more diagnosed psychological or physical [[disability]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Census 2000 counted 49.7 million people with some type of long lasting condition or disability. They represented 19.3 percent of the 257.2 million people who were aged 5 and older in the civilian non-institutionalized population -- or nearly one person in five..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-17.pdf |title=Disability Status: 2000 - Census 2000 Brief |date=March 2003 |publisher=US Census Bureau |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This percentage varies depending on [[DSM-IV Codes|how disabilities are defined]]. According to ''Census Brief 97-5'', "About 1 in 5 Americans have some kind of disability, and 1 in 10 have a severe disability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/3/97pubs/cenbr975.pdf |work=Census Brief |title=Disabilities Affect One-Fifth of All Americans |date=December 1997|publisher=US Census Bureau |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Census Bureau]] is legally charged with developing information on the type and prevalence of disability in the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siordia |first=Carlos |year=2014|title=Proxy-reports in the Ascertainment of Disability Prevalence with American Community Survey Data |journal=Journal Frailty &amp; Aging |volume=3|number=4|pages=238–246|doi=10.14283/jfa.2014.31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose of collecting ACS data on disability is to help the US Congress determine the allocation of federal funds and inform policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=U. S. Census Bureau |title=A Compass for Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data: What PUMS Data Users Need to Know |place=Washington, DC |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |year=2009 |url=https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2009/acs/ACSPUMS.pdf |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to identify the characteristics of the disabled population of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Brault M W.

===African Americans===
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the African American community has the highest rate of disability in the United States at 20.8 percent, slightly higher than the overall disability rate of 19.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Americans with Disabilities in 2002 |url=https://www.census.gov/population/pop-profile/dynamic/Disability.pdf |work=Population Profile of the United States: Dynamic Version |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given these statistics, it can be suggested that African Americans with disabilities experience the most severe [[underemployment]], [[unemployment]], and under education compared to other disability groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alston |first1=Reginald J. |last2=Russo |first2=Charles J. |last3=Miles |first3=Albert S. |year=1994 |title=Brown v.

==Discrimination in employment==
{{Further information|Employment discrimination}}
The US [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] requires all organizations that receive government funding to provide accessibility programs and services. A more recent law, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA), which came into effect in 1992, prohibits private employers, state and local governments, employment agencies and labor unions from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities in [[application for employment|job application]] procedures, hiring, firing, advancement, compensation, job training, or in the terms, conditions and privileges of employment. This includes organizations like retail businesses, movie theaters, and restaurants. They must make [[reasonable accommodation]] to people with different needs. Protection is extended to anyone with (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual, (B) a record of such an impairment, or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment. The second and third criteria are seen as ensuring protection from unjust discrimination based on a perception of risk, just because someone has a record of impairment or appears to have a disability or illness (e.g. features which may be erroneously taken as signs of an illness). Employment protection laws make discrimination against qualified individuals with a disability illegal and may also require provision of reasonable accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burkhauser |first1=Richard V. |last2=Schmeiser |first2=Maximilian D.|last3=Weathers II |first3=Robert R.|date=Jan 2012 |title=The Importance of Anti-Discrimination and Workers' Compensation Laws on the Provision of Workplace Accommodations Following the Onset of a Disability |journal=Industrial &amp; Labor Relations Review |volume=65 |issue=1 |doi=10.1177/001979391206500109 |pages=161–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasonable accommodations includes changes in the physical environment like making facilities more accessible but also include increasing job flexibility like job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules or reassignment to vacant position. Though many hold [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] that are more enlightened and informed than past years, the word “disability” carries few positive [[connotation]]s for most employers. Negative attitudes by employers toward potential employees with disabilities can lead to misunderstanding and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Darling |first=Peter |date=Aug 2007 |title=Disabilities and the Workplace |journal=Business NH Magazine |volume=24 |issue=8 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social Security Administration==
The US [[Social Security Administration]] (SSA), defines disability in terms of an individual's inability to perform substantial gainful activity (SGA), by which it means “work paying minimum wage or better”. The agency pairs SGA with a list of medical conditions that qualify individuals for [[disability benefits]].

The SSA makes available to disabled Americans two forms of disability benefits: [[Social Security Disability Insurance]], (SSDI) and [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI). Social Security pays disability benefits to citizens who have worked long enough and have a medical condition that has prevented them from working or is expected to prevent them from working for at least 12 months or end in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document |url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/EN-05-10029.pdf |title=Social Security - Disability Benefits |publisher=Social Security Administration |date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
===K-12===
Before the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] was passed, children with disabilities were at-risk of not receiving a free, appropriate public education. For IDEA to apply, the child must first be determined to be able to benefit from public education. This benefit is not exclusively limited to school-aged children, but applies to children with disabilities from infancy.

Due to societal stigma of disability, children are sometimes treated like disabled children, and not included in activities in which other children were able to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Mike Cole|title=Education, equality and human rights : issues of gender, race, sexuality, disability and social class|date=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|isbn=0-415-35660-1|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators can hold students with disabilities to lower expectations, which impacts their future educational attainment.&lt;ref name="AronLoprest"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aron|first1=L|last2=Loprest|first2=P|title=Disability and the education system|journal=The Future of Children|date=Spring 2012|volume=22|issue=1|page=97|doi=10.1353/foc.2012.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]], the school district must provide every disabled child with an [[Individualized Education Plan]] (IEP). The IEP is compiled by a team of school administrators and guardians, and may include a child advocate, counselors, occupational therapists, or other specialists. This team evaluates the goals for the child and determines what needs to be done in order for those goals to be met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brizuela|first=Gabriela|title=Making an "IDEA" a Reality: Providing a Free and Appropriate Public Education for Children with Disabilities Under the Individuals with Dsabilities Education Act|journal=Valparaiso University Law Review|year=2011|volume=45|accessdate=7 August 2015|url=http://scholar.valpo.edu/vulr/vol45/iss2/5)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with disabilities who do not have a parent or guardian advocating on their behalf are not as well served in the education system as their peers with parent or guardian advocates.&lt;ref name="AronLoprest"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=H.|last2=Bialk|first2=P.|last3=Freeze|first3=T.B.|last4=Freeze|first4=R.|last5=Lutfiyya|first5=Z.M.|title=Heidi’s and Philip’s stories:  transitions to post-secondary education|journal=British Journal of Learning Disabilities|date=2012|volume=40|page=87|doi=10.1111/j.1468-3156.2012.00746.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transition preparation from K-12 education to post-secondary education or career was initially written into IDEA to begin at age 12, but in the existing law, transition preparation does not begin until age 16. While this law provides a maximum age at which to begin transition preparation, students with disabilities have been known to receive transition preparation at a younger age, as the states might mandate a younger age, or the IEP team might determine a younger age is appropriate to begin the transition preparation of the student.&lt;ref name="Greatschools"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greatschools Staff|title=IDEA 2004 Close Up: Transition Planning|url=http://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/idea-2004-close-up-transition-planning/|website=greatschools.org|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some students with disabilities have noted not receiving any transition preparation at all. The transition services are to be designed to be results-oriented rather than outcome-oriented. This is to ensure the transition services are designed for the student's success.&lt;ref name="Greatschools"/&gt; Students are intended to attend their transition planning meetings with the IEP, yet not all students do. Some do attend, yet generally not take a leadership role - only fourteen percent do.&lt;ref name="Greatschools"/&gt; This places the students with a disability in a passive role instead of an agentic role in their own life plans.&lt;ref name="Claiborne"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Claiborne|first1=Lise Bird|last2=Cornforth|first2=Sue|last3=Gibson|first3=Ava|last4=Smith|first4=Alexandra|title=Supporting students with impairments in higher education:  social inclusion or cold comfort?|journal=International Journal of Inclusive Education|date=2011|volume=15|issue=5|pages=513–527|doi=10.1080/13603110903131747}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 study of a higher education institution located in the [[Midwestern United States]], it was found that one-third of students with disabilities felt their transition preparation was lacking. Many in this group were unaware of laws that pertained to disability and higher education.&lt;ref name="CarneyGinsberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carney|first1=K.|last2=Ginsberg|first2=S.|last3=Lee|first3=L.|last4=Li|first4=A.|last5=Orr|first5=A.|last6=Parks|first6=L.|last7=Schulte|first7=K.|title=Meeting the needs of students with disabilities in higher education: how well are we doing?|journal=The Delta Kappa Gamma Bulletin|date=Summer 2007|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leaves them without an understanding of their learning needs and unable to advocate for themselves.

===Higher Education===
Self-advocacy plays an important role in the success of students with disabilities in higher education.&lt;ref name="WagnerNewman"/&gt; While examination of self-advocacy skills has been largely limited to the impact in academic settings, self-advocacy skills, or the lack thereof, do also impact non-academic situations. A 2004 study noted only 3 percent of students with disabilities had self-advocacy training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cameto|first1=Renee|last2=Levine|first2=Phyllis|last3=Wagner|first3=Mary|title=Transition planning for students with disabilities|url=http://www.nlts2.org/reports/2004_11/nlts2_report_2004_11_execsum.pdf|website=National Longitudinal Transition Study 2|publisher=SRI International|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students with disabilities who are confident about their disability identity and self-advocacy skills are more likely to disclose their disabilities and advocate for their needs when interacting with faculty and staff. Advocacy service is also provided to students as staff from different programs help instructors in college, understand the needs of the disabled who are attending their classes. So much so that when disable students need extra time to complete their course then some arrangements are made to cater such students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strichart|first=Stephen S.|last2=Mangrum II|first2=Charles T.|date=1987|title=College Opportunities for the Learning Disabled in the United States|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0885625870020404|journal=European Journal of Special Needs Education|volume=2|issue=4|pages=247-258|doi=10.1080/0885625870020404|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students with disabilities who were embarrassed of their disability identity and did not understand their needs as learners looked to faculty and staff for solutions to accommodation needs.&lt;ref name="CarneyGinsberg"/&gt;  Education helps students with disabilities learn self-advocacy skills that affect their ability to advocate for their health, insurance, and other needs.&lt;ref name="AronLoprest"/&gt;

In spite of IDEA and [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 504]] providing support for education of people with disabilities, the educational outcomes of people with disabilities vary significantly from the outcomes of people without disabilities.&lt;ref name="AronLoprest"/&gt; After high school, a 2005 study found students with disabilities enroll in postsecondary education, whether college, technical school, or vocational school, at a rate of 46% compared to the rate of 63% for students without disabilities.&lt;ref name="AronLoprest"/&gt; This rate is up 23% since 1990, when the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] was passed.&lt;ref name="AronLoprest"/&gt; Specifically to four-year degree granting higher education institutions, 27% of students with disabilities attend compared to 54% of students without disabilities.&lt;ref name="CheathamElliott"/&gt; High school completion and postsecondary education enrollment vary per disability type.&lt;ref name="AronLoprest"/&gt;

Students with disabilities are responsible for advocating for their accommodations and needs as learners in higher education environments. Many higher education institutions have staff to work with students with disabilities on their accommodation requests.&lt;ref name="BryanMyers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bryan|first1=A.|last2=Myers|first2=K.|title=Students with Disabilities:  Doing What’s Right|journal=About Campus|date=2006|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher education institutions do vary in process to obtain accommodations and accommodations provided.&lt;ref name="BryanMyers"/&gt; The staff members at the higher education institutions can recommend accommodations. The faculty members, however, may choose to vary or not implement the accommodations at all based upon concerns of weakening academic integrity of the course or risking the possibility of endless accommodation requests.&lt;ref name="CarneyGinsberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Claiborne"/&gt; When working with faculty members about accommodations, nearly half of the students with disabilities recalled receiving a negative response, while the other half felt their faculty members were accommodating.&lt;ref name="CarneyGinsberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Claiborne"/&gt;

For people with disabilities, having a four-year college degree provides significant employment and salary advantages.&lt;ref name="CheathamElliott"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horn|first1=L.|last2=Berktold|first2=J.|title=Students with disabilities in postsecondary education: A profile of preparation, participation, and outcomes|journal=National Center for Education Statistics, U.S. Department of Education, Statistical Analysis Report No. 1999-187|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shaw|first1=S.F.|last2=Scott|first2=S.S.|title=New directions in faculty development|journal=Journal of Postsecondary Education and Disability|date=2003|volume=17|issue=1|pages=3–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurance==
It is illegal for California insurers to refuse to provide [[vehicle insurance|car insurance]] to properly licensed drivers solely because they have a disability.&lt;ref name="findlaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/INS/1/d2/3/1/5 |title=California Code - Article 5: Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance |publisher=Codes.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also illegal for them to refuse to provide car insurance "on the basis that the owner of the motor vehicle to be insured is blind,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/INS/1/d2/3/1/5/s11628.7 |title=CAL. INS. CODE § 11628.7 : California Code - Section 11628.7 |publisher=Codes.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are allowed to exclude coverage for injuries and damages incurred while a blind unlicensed owner is actually operating the vehicle (the law is apparently structured to allow blind people to buy and insure cars which their friends, family, and caretakers can drive for them).&lt;ref name="findlaw"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19335">The [[Roman Empire]] is often thought of as one of the great civilizations and empires of all time, but the prevalence of disease in Rome's history is often overlooked.

Hygiene in ancient Rome was not ideal for combating diseases. Their [[Sanitation in ancient Rome|sewer system]], praised for its longevity, had many flaws. As ''Water History''’s Roger Hanson explains, street drainage and sewage flowed through the same pipes, which led to sewage openings on the streets. Also, since most sewer systems were privately owned, they were also privately maintained and in turn neglected. Instead, citizens would turn to their latrines; if they lived on anything but the ground floor they would even throw their excrement onto the street. This led to exposure of sewage to flies, dogs, and bacteria, all of which helped spread disease among Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Roger D. "Water and Wastewater Systems in Imperial Rome." Water History. n.p. n.d. Web. 5 October 2013. http://www.waterhistory.org/histories/rome/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bathing ====
The high poverty rate in Rome led to a need for public baths, or [[thermae]] since it was uncommon for the middle class citizens to own one of their own according to journalist Jay Stuller. When the heated bath water was not chemically cleansed or filtered with chemicals such as chlorine, bacteria thrived and spread. When [[Christianity]] came to Rome, it saw the public nudity of the bathing system and saw it as debauchery and therefore frowned upon. While the bathing system may not have been pristine, abstaining from cleanliness altogether brought upon many more potentially fatal diseases, especially in infants. This trend started and ended in Rome.{{clarify|date=September 2016}} As the necessity for bathing became recognized, the protests of the Christian church died down and a new elaborate bathing system was designed under the rule of [[Emperor Augustus]]. Even an imperial-version [[sauna]] was created for cleansing the body of toxins.&lt;ref&gt;Stuller, Jay. "Cleanliness has only recently become a virtue." Academic Search Premier. n.p. n.d. Web. 5 October 2013. http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=f4bc1306-4dfd-408b-a8a5-6be498f5492a%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=123&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=9103042983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diet ====
In contrast to today's diet, Romans ate little meat. According to scholar Linda Gigante, they consumed large amounts of grain, fruits, and some vegetables. Similar to the diet encouraged by modern United States' [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]], the poor were given monthly supplies of grain and hardly had money to pay for anything else. Due to this, many Romans suffered from [[malnutrition]] and multiple vitamin deficiencies. Even those who had money for food didn’t always have the best choices. There was no food and drug regulatory agency in ancient times, so low food standards brought contamination and parasites. Also apparent is the water quality. The [[Roman Army]]’s drinking from the contaminated [[Tiber River]] contributed to their vulnerability to many diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Gigante, Linda. "Death and Disease in Ancient Rome." Innominate Society. n.p. n.d. Web. 5 October 2013. http://www.innominatesociety.com/Articles/Death%20and%20Disease%20in%20Ancient%20Rome.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environment ===

==== Population density ====
Rome had an extremely high population, and remnants of buildings suggest the average living space was very small.&lt;ref name="Scheidel" /&gt; Many people crammed into small spaces led to very high rates of infection for transmittable diseases. The Antonine and Cyprian plagues were transmitted through touch, so a dense population rate would contribute highly to their spread.

==== Deforestation ====
[[Deforestation]] of Rome's cities, particularly near the [[Tiber River]], led to higher disease rates. The causality is as follows: deforestation lead to a rising water table, which increased marshes. This increased the larva in Rome, and in turn increased disease borne from blood-sucking bugs. As in many of today's third world countries, mosquitos and other [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] were carriers of various diseases, such as [[malaria]] and the [[Ross River virus]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Angus, Andrew Jardine, Lara O’Sullivan, and Philip Weinstein. "Deforestation, Mosquitoes, and Ancient Rome". Academic Search Premier. n.p. n.d. Web. 5 October 2013. http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=cc04577b-3b35-4782-b8bf-231e6cc1907b%40sessionmgr111&amp;vid=6&amp;hid=123.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diseases ==
[[Influenza]], colds, and other ailments were just as apparent, if not more, in Imperial Rome as in today's life. However, they had many more noteworthy afflictions from catastrophic plagues to [[sexually transmitted diseases]].

=== Plagues ===

==== The Antonine Plague ====
The [[Antonine Plague]], possibly the most widespread and catastrophic outbreak of disease in Imperial Rome, was named after the emperor whose reign it originated in, [[Aurelius Antoninus]] according to Louise Cilliers and Francis Retief. Historical sources suggest that Roman soldiers returning from campaign in Mesopotamia spread the disease, which lasted from 165-180 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sicker, (2000). "The Struggle over the Euphrates Frontier". The Pre-Islamic Middle East. (Greenwood) 2000:p.169 {{ISBN|0-275-96890-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the written observations of [[fever]], [[diarrhea]], and [[boils]] by the Greek physician [[Galen]], historians infer that [[smallpox]] caused the plague.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Verity. "Past Pandemics that Ravaged Europe." BBC. n.p. 7 November 2005. Web. 5 October 2013. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4381924.stm.&lt;/ref&gt; Including substantial army deaths, the outbreaks decimated an estimated two thirds of the Roman population, killing roughly 2000 people per day.&lt;ref name="Retief"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Retief|author2=Cilliers|date=March 2000|volume=90|issue=3|pages=267–272|title=Epidemics of the Roman Empire, 27 BC-AD 476 |journal=South African Medical Journal|pmid=10853405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Plague of Cyprian ====
Cilliers and Reteif go on to describe that the second great plague affecting Rome. The [[Plague of Cyprian]], mainly occurred from 251 to 266 AD with some traces lingering as late as 270 AD; although considered to be separate from the Antonine Plague, it is very similar and also believed to have originated from smallpox, or perhaps [[measles]]. [[Cyprian|Saint Cyprian]] makes the most vivid description of the effects of the disease as dysentery, loss of motor skills, and of course fever, and in turn has the disease named after him (also possibly due to the oppression of Christianity at the time). Notably, his list does not include skin rashes or swelling, which is the main separation from the [[bubonic plague]] and Antonine Plague.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, George Childs. "Plague of Cyprian." Encyclopedia of Plague and Pestilence: From Ancient Times to the Present, Third Edition. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2008. Ancient and Medieval History Online. Facts On File, Inc. 5 October 2013. http://www.fofweb.com/History/HistRefMain.asp?iPin=ENPP140&amp;SID=2&amp;DatabaseName=Ancient+and+Medieval+History+Online&amp;InputText=%22Saint+Cyprian%22&amp;SearchStyle=&amp;dTitle=plague+of+Cyprian&amp;TabRecordType=All+Records&amp;BioCountPass=3&amp;SubCountPass=2&amp;DocCountPass=0&amp;ImgCountPass=0&amp;MapCountPass=0&amp;FedCountPass=&amp;MedCountPass=0&amp;NewsCountPass=0&amp;RecPosition=4&amp;AmericanData=&amp;WomenData=&amp;AFHCData=&amp;IndianData=&amp;WorldData=&amp;AncientData=Set&amp;GovernmentData=.&lt;/ref&gt; This plague was very widespread, possibly originating in [[Ethiopia]] and spreading to [[Scotland]]. With the skin contact-spreading nature of the disease and the crowded civilization style in Rome, the death toll was tremendous in the empire.&lt;ref name="Retief" /&gt;

=== Blood-borne diseases ===

==== Morbus Gallicus ====
Morbus Gallicus, better known in modern times as [[syphilis]], or the "French Disease" was not prominent in ancient Europe but with recent bone studies, it has been found that a type of European treponematoses bacteria may have even affected children.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, Mary. "Pompeii Skeletons Reveal Secrets of Roman Family Life." BBC. n.p. 13 December 2010. Web. 5 October 2010. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11952322.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to an article published by Kristin Harper in 2008, ancient European civilizations may have suffered from a related form of the bacteria but not venereal syphilis itself, which may have had its origin in the pre-Columbian Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000148 |pmid=18235852 |pmc=2217670 |title=On the Origin of the Treponematoses: A Phylogenetic Approach |journal=PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=e148 |year=2008 |last1=Harper |first1=Kristin N |last2=Ocampo |first2=Paolo S |last3=Steiner |first3=Bret M |last4=George |first4=Robert W |last5=Silverman |first5=Michael S |last6=Bolotin |first6=Shelly |last7=Pillay |first7=Allan |last8=Saunders |first8=Nigel J |last9=Armelagos |first9=George J }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ‘syphilis" was coined later on by a 15th-century Italian poet [[Girolamo Fracastoro]], who wrote an epic poem of a boy named Syphilus who insulted [[Apollo]], and was in turn punished with the disease. During the Medieval and Renaissance periods the likely mutated forms of the treponematoses resulted in epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;Killgrove, Kristina. "Morbus Gallicus in the Roman Empire." Powered by Osteons. n.p. 17 October 2011. Web. 5 October 2013. http://www.poweredbyosteons.org/2011/10/morbus-gallicus-in-roman-empire.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malaria ====
The earliest known case of [[malaria]] is from Roman DNA dated to 450 AD. An excavation of a village shows signs of a serious malaria problem, with bone tests and traces of [[honeysuckle]], a plant used to treat fevers. Also noted is that the area was a "zone of pestilence".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Andrew. "Malaria and the Fall of Rome." BBC. n.p. 17 February 2011. Web. 5 October 2013. http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/malaria_01.shtml.&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation and sanitation issues were the main causes of malaria.

==== Mentagra ====
Mentagra, notably thought by the Imperial Romans to be spread by kissing, was a skin disease most commonly starting in the chin and moving on to the entire face and sometimes other body parts. The aesthetic factor was very unappealing, while the disease was hardly adverse to health at all. Even though it was not dangerous, Romans ironically went as far as scar-inducing cauterizations to rid them of the abhorrent disease.&lt;ref name="Retief" /&gt;

=== Respiratory disease ===
Respiratory disease, most prominently [[anthracosis]], was common due to pollution in Roman homes according to Professor Luigi Capasso. [[Carbon]] was constantly produced with their lamps, cooking, and fireplaces. The carbon produced lesions on their lungs, apparent in bone studies (made possible by the well-preserved bodies stored under the remnants of a volcanic eruption of [[Vesuvius]]) and even a study on a Roman mummy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71971-1 |title=Indoor pollution and respiratory diseases in Ancient Rome |journal=The Lancet |volume=356 |issue=9243 |pages=1774 |year=2000 |last1=Capasso |first1=Luigi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevant study ==
An extensive study done by Mario Novak and Mario Slaus found many skeletal remains available for examination in one specific colony in ancient Rome, Colonia Iulia Iader also known as [[Zadar]]. With tests it was found that the mean age of death for men was 37.4 years (with a [[standard deviation]] of 9.43 years), and for women was 38.4 years (with a standard deviation of 9.29 years). While this is only a sample representation of our study population, it could give reasonable insights to the whole of Rome. In the remains, several indicators of nutritional stress were found widespread among certain age groups. With the rates of these nutritional problems, it was even found that Romans favored male children in things like breastfeeding, leaving the females with higher rates of malnutrition. [[Periostitis]] was also found in many samples, with a frequency indicating overcrowding and overall poor quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20834058 |url=http://www.isita-org.com/jass/Contents/2010vol88/PDFonline/20834058.pdf |year=2010 |author1=Novak |first1=M |title=Health and disease in a Roman walled city: An example of Colonia Iulia Iader |journal=[[Journal of Anthropological Sciences]] |volume=88 |pages=189–206 |last2=Slaus |first2=M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
Rome had a few prominent [[physicians]] in its Imperial era who came up with treatment for various diseases, and were generally the only source of medicinal information. Their service was focused on the military, which was often the most vulnerable group to any given disease. [[Dioscorides]] served under Emperor Nero, experimenting with surgical techniques and medicinal herbs. [[Pliny the Elder]] also had a strong focus on botany, well known for his herbal knowledge. [[Galen]], perhaps the most prominent Roman physician, studied anatomy as well as herbal remedies.&lt;ref name="RedRampant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redrampant.com/2009/07/roman-medicinal-herbs.html|title=RedRampant.com: Roman Medicinal Herbs|author=Andrew|date=7 July 2009|accessdate=24 October 2013}}{{Self-published source|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Herbal medicines ===
Natural medicine was of great importance, seeing as they could not synthetically manufacture anything. Many traces of herbs at ancient Roman army bases have been found, as well as medicated wine. Army doctors had knowledge of the herbs, and perhaps even grew their own in their respective gardens.&lt;ref&gt;"The Military Medicine of Ancient Rome." Science and Its Times. Ed. Neil Schlager and Josh Lauer. Vol. 1. Detroit: Gale, 2001. World History In Context. Web. 5 October 2013. http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/whic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?zid=7a6408a0d3ad1dc47110c6f113b7595b&amp;action=2&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CCV2643450064&amp;userGroupName=lith7757&amp;jsid=df5bb02a963d9ab7844f7d5c4ac37ddd.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans were not correct with all of the herbs uses, but a placebo effect possibly still made some of the herbs useful.

==== Anti-inflammatory ====

===== Marigold (Calendula officinalis)  =====
[[Calendula officinalis|Marigold]] was used mainly to prevent/reduce fevers.&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;

===== Chamomile (Matricaria Chamomilla and Anthemis nobilis) =====
[[Chamomile]] was identified by Pliny as treatment for headaches and inflammation of the kidneys and liver.&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;

==== Disease prevention ====

===== Hyssop (Hyssopus officinalis) =====
[[Hyssop]] was believed by Romans to prevent both the Antonine and Cyprian plagues. This inaccurate assumption was most likely based on the fact that Hyssop has oils that can treat coughing often found in plague victims.&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;

===== Garlic (Allium Sativum) =====
[[Garlic]] is suggested as a sort of panacea in Galen's studies, and as such was used to fend off virus, bacteria, parasites, and fungus in Imperial Rome.&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;

==== Cough treatment ====

===== Marshmallow (Althea officinallis) =====
[[Marshmallow root]] was thought by Pliny to be effective as a cough remedy.&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;

===== Horehound (Marrubium vulgare) =====
Pliny also found [[white horehound]] to be effective at treating coughs.&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;

==== Performance enabling supplements  ====

===== Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus) =====
[[Tarragon]] was used by Romans to enhance their stamina in daily tasks, particularly soldiers who walked extensively.&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;

===== Parsley (Petroselinum Crispum) =====
[[Gladiators]], and perhaps even soldiers, consumed [[parsley]] in the hopes that it would give them an edge above their opponent.&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;
they were used to tame wild animals and for the gladiators to get the edge on their fights

==== Wound treatment ====

===== Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) =====
[[Yarrow]] is an healing agent, and is shown to exist in Imperial times through stories such as Homer's Illiad, where it is used by Achilles to treat a wound.&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;

===== Uva Ursi (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi) =====
Galen's notes show [[uva ursi]] was commonly used to reduce bleeding and to nurse various types of wounds.&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;

===== Borage (Borago officinalis L) =====
[[Borage]] was used mainly to combat tissue inflammation/bruising.&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;

===== Plantain (Plantago major, minor, lanceolata) =====
[[Plantago major|Plantain]] was believed to be effective at nursing wounds and also reversing the effects of various poisons.&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;

==== Military use ====

===== Blackberry (Rubicus fruticosus) =====
With the low water quality and unideal diet of Roman armies, soldiers often suffered from dysentery. Pliny's remedy to this was for the soldiers to consume [[blackberry]] leaves and even [[Bark (botany)|bark]].&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;

===== Thyme (Thymus vulgaris) =====
The poor living conditions and many ailments of being in the Roman army often led to depression in the soldiers. For some reason, it was commonly believed that lying on [[thyme]] while sleeping would provide a more positive outlook. Although less common, some Roman civilians also practiced this. While this is a misconception, a [[placebo]] effect may have even stronger effects on mental ailments such as depression.&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;

===== Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecurn) =====
[[Fenugreek]] was readily available for the [[Roman cavalry|cavalry]] units in Imperial Rome, as they would feed it to their horses as a treatment for most sicknesses. It was also commonly used for cattle and other livestock. While that was the main use, it was also sometimes prescribed to citizens for things such as fevers and diseases resembling [[anthracosis]]. Fenugreek has been recorded in modern times as a somewhat effective [[anti-inflammatory]], so this was one of the herbs Roman physicians correctly identified.&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;

===== Stinging nettle (Utrica dioica) =====
Roman troops made use of [[stinging nettle]] when traveling to cold foreign climates. When stung with the needles, it provided a warm sensation that helped the soldiers gradually grow accustomed to harsh conditions.&lt;ref name="RedRampant" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13523">An '''eye care professional''' ('''ECP''') is an individual who provides a service related to the [[human eye|eye]]s or [[Visual perception|vision]]. It is any healthcare worker involved in eye care, from one with a small amount of post-secondary training to practitioners with a doctoral level of education.

==Types==

===Ophthalmologist===
{{main|Ophthalmology}}
Ophthalmologists are “…[[Doctor of Medicine|medical]] and [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|osteopathic]] doctors who provide comprehensive eye care, including medical, surgical and optical care.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Academy |url=http://www.aao.org/about/index.cfm |website=American Academy of Ophthalmology |accessdate=13 January 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VYkrxmt1?url=http://www.aao.org/about/index.cfm |archivedate=13 January 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, this requires four years of college, four years of medical school, one year general internship, three years of residency, then optional fellowship for 1 to 2 years (typically 12–14 years of education after high school). An ophthalmologist can perform all the tests an optometrist can and in addition is a fully qualified medical doctor and surgeon. Ophthalmologists undergo extensive and intensive medical and surgical exams to qualify and entrance criteria to a training program is highly competitive. Some ophthalmologists receive additional advanced training (or fellowship) in specific areas of ophthalmology, such as retina, cornea, glaucoma, laser vision correction, pediatric ophthalmology, uveitis, pathology, or neuro-ophthalmology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=22559&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ophthalmic medical practitioner===
{{main|Ophthalmic medical practitioner}}
An ophthalmic medical practitioner is a medical doctor (MD) who specializes in ophthalmic conditions but who has not completed a specialization in ophthalmology.

===Optometrist===
{{main|Optometry}}
The [[World Council of Optometry]], a member of the [[World Health Organization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our partners|url=http://www.worldoptometry.org/en/about-wco/partnerships.cfm|website=World Council of Optometry|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines [[optometrist]]s as 
“…the primary healthcare practitioners of the eye and visual system who provide comprehensive eye and vision care, which includes [[refraction]] and dispensing, detection/diagnosis and management of disease in the eye, and the rehabilitation of conditions of the visual system.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who is an optometrist? |url=http://www.worldoptometry.org/en/about-wco/who-is-an-optometrist/index.cfm |website=World Council of Optometry |accessdate=13 January 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VYlYtvKU?url=http://www.worldoptometry.org/en/about-wco/who-is-an-optometrist/index.cfm |archivedate=13 January 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Doctor of Optometry]] (OD) attends four years of college, four years of optometry school and then an optional one-year residency.  Optometrists undergo extensive and intensive refractive and medical training mainly pertaining to the eye and the entrance criteria to attend optometry school is also highly competitive. An OD is fully qualified to treat eye diseases and disorders and specializes in optics and vision correction. Permissions granted by an optometric license vary by location.
*In the United States and Canada, the standard education is four years of college and four years of optometry school at an accredited [[Doctor of Optometry]] (OD) program. An additional one to two years of residency, fellowship and/or specialty training is required to qualify for certain positions. All optometry colleges in the U.S. currently provide training in the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases and minimally invasive procedures, such as foreign body removal and meibomian gland expression.
*In the United States, optometrists are defined (in some cases) as [[Physician|doctors]] under [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/doctor-and-other-health-care-provider-services.html|title=Doctor &amp; other health care provider services {{!}} Medicare.gov|website=www.medicare.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but laws pertaining to optometry vary by state.
**All states allow treatment of eye diseases, including the use of topical pharmaceuticals (by properly licensed optometrists)
**48/50 states allow prescription of oral medications to treat eye diseases
**Many states allow optometrists to perform injections in and around the eye
**Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Louisiana allow optometrists to perform certain laser surgeries.
*Outside of the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and Philippines, optometrists are often limited in their use of pharmaceuticals. In most of these countries, optometry is either a 4-year or 5-year college degree and they are not classified as doctors.

===Orthoptist===
{{main|Orthoptics}}
Orthoptists specialize in diagnosis and management of eye movement and coordination problems, misalignment of the visual axis, convergence and accommodation problems, and conditions such as [[amblyopia]], [[strabismus]], and [[binocular vision]] disorders, as outlined by the [[International Orthoptic Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|website=International Orthoptic Association|url=http://www.internationalorthoptics.org/about-us.html|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may assist ophthalmologists in surgery, teach orthoptic students, students of other allied health professions, medical students, and ophthalmology residents and fellows, act as vision researchers, perform vision screening, perform low vision assessments and act as clinical administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalorthoptics.org/download/1160331924_3.1._pr_01_rev_06.doc |title=The Orthoptist |publisher=International Orthoptic Association |year=2001 |format=Word Document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731141108/http://www.internationalorthoptics.org/download/1160331924_3.1._pr_01_rev_06.doc |archivedate=July 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocularists specialize in the fabrication and fitting of [[ocular prosthetic|ocular prostheses]] for people who have lost eyes due to trauma or illness.

===Optician===
{{main|Optician}}
Opticians specialize in the fitting and fabrication of ophthalmic lenses, [[spectacles]], [[contact lenses]], [[low vision]] aids and ocular prosthetics.  They may also be referred to as an "optical dispenser", "dispensing optician", "ophthalmic dispenser".  The prescription for the corrective lenses must be supplied by an ophthalmologist, optometrist or in some countries an orthoptist. This is a regulated profession in most jurisdictions.

===Ophthalmic medical personnel===
A collective term for allied health personnel in ophthalmology. It is often used to refer to specialized personnel (unlike ocularists or opticians). In many countries these allied personnel may just be known as an "ophthalmic assistant". Their training is usually combined with a two or three year applied science degree and they assist an [[ophthalmologist]] or [[optometrist]] in the hospital or clinic with vision testing.

In the USA the [[Joint Commission on Allied Health Personnel in Ophthalmology]] administers OMP certifications:

===Oculist===
Oculist is an older term that was primarily used to describe eye care professionals that are trained and specialized in the eye care field, specifically ophthalmologists and optometrists.  The term is no longer used in the United States.

===Vision therapist===
{{main|Vision therapy}}
A vision therapist, usually either an orthoptist or optometrist, works with patients that require vision therapy, such as low vision patients. Commonly, vision therapy is performed in [[children]] who develop problems with their vision mostly because they are using their eyes up close. This type of therapy is however generally used in patients who need visual correction but for whom the corrective lenses are not enough to reverse the condition. Visual therapy in children is performed by optometrists who specialize in children eye care. To specialize in vision therapy, doctors must complete extensive post-graduate training beyond their optometric degree, at which time they are eligible to sit for their national boards to become fully certified as specialists in children's vision. A doctor's title after passing the national board in vision therapy is Fellow in the [[College of Optometrists in Vision Development]], or F.C.O.V.D. Optometrists who provide vision therapy but who have not yet sat for their certification exams are board-eligible Associates in the College of Optometrists in Vision Development.
Vision therapists typically use [[Prism (optics)|prisms]], eye patches, filtered lenses, and computerized systems to conduct therapy sessions.

Most eye care professionals do not practice [[iridology]], citing a significant lack of scientific evidence for the practice.

==Distinction between ophthalmologists, optometrists and orthoptists==
In a gross oversimplification, it can be said that ophthalmologists are eye surgeons and primary eye care physicians while optometrists are primary eye care providers.  There is considerable overlap in scope of practice between professions.  Laws regarding licensure vary by location, but typically ophthalmologists are licensed to provide the same care as an optometrist, with the addition of surgical options.  In most locations surgery is the biggest difference between the two professions.  Optometrists frequently refer patients to ophthalmologists when the condition requires surgery or intra-ocular injection.

Historically, ophthalmology has developed as a specialization of medical doctors while optometry originated as a profession that fitted people with glasses.  This difference has decreased as the majority of optometrists screen for and treat eye disease and many ophthalmologists fit people with [[corrective lenses]].  The difference in background previously caused some conflict between the two professions.  Ophthalmologists have voiced concern that an optometrist's educational background is different from their own.  Optometrists have criticized ophthalmologists of caring for the health structure of the eye while letting other vision disorders go untreated.    For example, consider a patient with [[glaucoma]] and [[spasm of accommodation]].  Ophthalmologists would be concerned that an optometrist would fail to identify or otherwise mistreat the glaucoma.  Optometrist would worry that the ophthalmologist would fail to identify or mistreat the spasm of accommodation.  As of 2012, both these concerns are invalid because the education of both types of professionals prepares them to handle both conditions. (This may not be true globally as the definition and education of both professions varies country to country.)  Because of cooperation between optometrists and ophthalmologists, the quality of care depends more on the abilities of the individual doctors than it does what type of professional they are.

Orthoptists specialize in the diagnosis and management of problems with eye movement and coordination, such as misalignment of the visual axis, binocular vision problems, and pre/post surgical care of strabismus patients.  They do not directly treat ocular disease with medications or surgery. Orthoptists are trained to treat patients using optical aids and eye exercises&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ranzco.edu/orthoptists-and-prescribing-in-nsw/view?searchterm=None&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2015}}. Orthoptists are primarily found working alongside ophthalmologists and optometrists to co-manage binocular vision treatment, visual field loss management and accommodative therapy. They often do standard eye and vision testing along with computerised axillary testing.

All three types of professional perform screenings for common ocular problems affecting children (such as [[amblyopia]] and [[strabismus]]) and adults (such as [[cataract]]s, [[glaucoma]], and [[diabetic retinopathy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Georgievski|first1=Z|last2=Koklanis|first2=K|last3=Fenton|first3=A|last4=Koukouras|first4=I|title=Victorian orthoptists' performance in the photo evaluation of diabetic retinopathy|journal=Clinical &amp; Experimental Ophthalmology|date=November 2007|volume=35|issue=8|pages=733–738|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9071.2007.01576.x|pmid=17997777}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; All are required to participate in ongoing continuing education courses to maintain licensure and stay current on the latest standards of care.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28231">'''Health in Norway''', with its early history of poverty and infectious diseases along with famines and epidemics, was for most of the population not good at least into the 1800s. The country eventually changed from a peasant society to an industrial one and established a public health system in 1860.

== History ==
In the early [[Norway]] faced major challenges. The differences between rich and poor were large, living conditions poor and [[infant mortality]] high. Economic conditions in the country improved, but still some social groups lived under constrained conditions. The nutritional status was poor as well as hygiene and living conditions. The conditions and class differences were worse in the cities than in the countryside.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nordhagen|first1=R|last2=Major|first2=E|last3=Tverdal|first3=A|last4=Irgens|first4=L|last5=Graff-Iversen|first5=S|title=Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014|url=http://www.fhi.no/artikler/?id=110607|publisher=Folkehelseinstituttet|accessdate=2014-09-02|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immunization against smallpox was introduced in the first decade of the 19th century.  In 1855, [[Gaustad Hospital]] opened as the first mental asylum in the country and was the start of an expansion in treating people with such disorders.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt; After 1900 living standards and health conditions improved and the nutritional status improved as poverty decreased. Improvement in public health occurred during development in several areas such as social and living conditions, changes in disease and medical outbreaks, establishment of the health care system and emphasis on public health matters. Vaccination and increased treatment opportunities with antibiotics resulted in great improvements. Average income increased as did improvements in hygiene. Nutrition became better and more effective also improving general health.

In the 1900s the situation improved in Norway and, as a result of decreased poverty, nutritional status improved. Within 100 years Norway became a wealthy nation. Even though Norway experienced a setback during [[World War II]], the country achieved steady development. Improved hygiene led to fewer infectious diseases and scientific discoveries lead to breakthroughs in many fields including health.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;

However, an economic downturn in the 1920s exacerbated the nutritional situation within the country. Nutrition therefore became an important part of social policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordby|first1=T|title=Helsedirektør Evangs planer for velferdsstaten|journal=Michael|date=2009|volume=6|pages=331–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In periods there were high rates of unemployment, and poverty affected women and children most. Children often had to walk long distances to get work as shepherds during the summer in order to help their families with income. In mining towns as [[Røros]], children also had to work in the mines.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt; Living conditions improved during the 1900s. From being a poor country, Norway developed within 100 years to become a wealthy nation. Even though the country experienced a setback under the Second World War, the country achieved steady development. From 1975 Norway was self-sufficient in petroleum products and oil became an important part of the Norwegian economy. Improved hygiene led to fewer infectious diseases and scientific discoveries lead to breakthroughs in many fields including health.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;

After 1945, [[smoking]] became a relevant factor. While infectious diseases decreased, chronic diseases as cardiovascular disease was blooming.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt; From 2000, life expectancy was still on the increase. There are, however, still social differences when it comes to health. While globalization increases the demand for infectious control and knowledge, the Norwegian population demands more from the government in regard to health and treatment.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;

=== Infant mortality ===
Early on, there were no statistics kept for the whole country on infant mortality, but in [[Asker]] and [[Bærum]] in 1809 infant mortality was 40 percent for all live births.&lt;ref&gt;Fure E. Spedbarnsdødeligheten i Asker og Bærum på 1700- og 1800 tallet. Tidsskr Nor Lægeforen 2005; 125: 3468-71.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, infant mortality was higher in Norway than in any other European country. Development of the welfare state has contributed to a great decrease in infant mortality rates. This can be attributed to better nutrition and living conditions, better education and economy, better treatment possibilities and preventive health care (especially immunization).&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt; The infant mortality rate increased again between the 1970 and 1980 due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). SIDS was unknown from earlier, but the increase was dramatic. The trend was reversed when Norwegian parents were encouraged to lay their children on their backs and not their stomachs when sleeping.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;

=== Population ===
At the beginning of the 19th century the total population was just under 1 million, however it doubled within the next hundred years even though many decided to emigrate. Industrialization resulted in many people emigrating from the countryside to the major cities for work.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt; At the beginning of the 1900s the population was 2,2 million and increased to about 4,5 million through the 1900s. 15 percent of the country’s population lived in Oslo and Akershus. The proportion of people associated with agriculture, forestry and fishing declined while the percentage affiliated with industries increased.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;

=== Communicable diseases ===
The Norwegian government recognized that the population needed to improve its health if the country was to become a nation with strong economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moseng|first1=OG|title=Ansvaret for undersåttenes helse (1603-1850)|date=2003|publisher=Universitetsforlaget}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Cholera]] and [[typhoid fever]] were common communicable diseases in the 1800s. Norway experienced several epidemics; cholera was the worst. The last epidemic outbreaks were around the 1840s. Even though these were not as severe as the [[Black Death]] in the 1300s, mortality rates were high.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;
*[[Sexually transmitted disease]]s also caused widespread problems. These were, however, not defined and divided into [[gonorrhea]] and [[syphilis]] until later on{{when|date=September 2014}}.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;
*[[Smallpox]] was the most serious disease in the years around 1800; legislation for vaccination against smallpox was introduced in 1810. At first, the law was not strictly enforced but when people were commanded to show their vaccination cards at confirmations and weddings, there was an increase in the vaccinating of children and Norway finally gained some control over this disease.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;
*[[Leprosy]], also known as Hansen's disease, ravaged the west coast of Norway. Patients were isolated in leprosy hospitals with room for up to 1000 patients. [[Gerhard Armauer Hansen]] (1841-1912), working in [[Bergen]], discovered the leprosy bacillus. He revealed the association between hospitalization for infected patients and a decrease in the number of new cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Irgens|first1=LM|title=Leprosy in Norway. An Epidemiological Study Based on a National Patient Registry|journal=Lepr Rev|date=1980|volume=51 | pages = 1–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Irgens|first1=LM|title=The Discovery of Mycobacterium Leprae. A Medical Achievement in the Light of Evolving Scientific Methods|journal=Am J Dermatopathol|date=1984|volume=6| pages = 337–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tuberculosis]] caused many deaths in the late 1800s while leprosy rates declined. Mortality of tuberculosis was high around 1900, but decreased steadily for the next fifty years. The greatest decrease in tuberculosis happened before vaccinations and medical treatments were available; the decrease was caused by improved living conditions, nutrition, and hygiene.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;
*The [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]] of 1918 affected the country. This influenza pandemic took many lives, especially those of young people who lacked immunity to the new flu virus.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;
*[[Diphtheria]], a common childhood disease, raged during the early years of World War II, but with new vaccines available, the country experienced an immediate positive response.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;
*[[Poliomyelitis|Polio]] had its last major outbreak in 1951 when 2100 cases were registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flugsrud|first1=LB|title=50 år med poliovaksine i Norge|journal=Tidsskr Nor Lægeforen|date=2006|volume=126: 3251}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 immunization of polio started.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;

=== Discovery of microbes ===
In the late 1800s microbes were discovered and prevention of diseases were now possible. Until now, spreading of infections had only been debated. With new discoveries within the field and greater understanding on how bacteria and viruses transfer and spread among humans it was possible to make significant changes in treatment and care of patients. One example was to isolate people with leprosy and tuberculosis in order to stop spreading.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014|url=http://www.fhi.no/publikasjoner-og-haandboker/folkehelserapporten/folkehelse-i-historien|website=Folkehelseinstituttet|accessdate=5 February 2016|language=Norwegian Bokmål|date=2014|quote=[Det kom] lovpålegg om smitteisolasjon, slik som for eksempel ved lepra i 1877 og tuberkulose i 1900.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antibiotics ===
In the 1900s many vaccines were developed and the first antibiotic, penicillin, came about in the 1940s. These introductions were very powerful tools in preventing and treatment of childhood diseases.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;

=== Vaccines ===
More vaccines became available and the child-vaccination-program was growing rapidly. Almost all feared childhood diseases were going extinct. Vaccines against measles (rubella) were introduced to the childhood immunization program in 1978. [[Rubella]] is dangerous to the fetus if the mother is affected during pregnancy. Today, all children are offered free vaccines and the offer is voluntary. The coverage for most vaccines is high.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS ===
In the early 1980s AIDS came as an unknown disease. Norway was early in preventing it in high-risk groups, through information campaigns. The HIV virus was later discovered and HIV tests became available from 1985.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;

=== Cardiovascular diseases ===
Incidences of tuberculosis became fewer and an increase in cases and mortality of chronic diseases appeared, especially cardiovascular disease. Tobacco is one of the most important causes of cardiovascular and cancer diseases. During World War 2, the tobacco use in Norway was limited because of strict rationing. After the war, sale of tobacco bloomed and so did the implications from consuming it.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;
In the late 1900s, chronic diseases are dominating and because of increased life expectancy, people live longer with these chronic diseases. 
Around millennium new treatment and prevention for cardiovascular diseases ensured a decrease in mortality, however, these diseases are still one of the greatest public challenges in the country.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;  The incidence of coronary heart disease in Norway reduced significantly between 1995 and 2010 about 66% of the reduction due to changes in modifiable risk factors like activity levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Mortality reduced from 137 per 100,000 Person-years to 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tromsø Study Documents Dramatic Decline in CHD in Norway|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/854901|accessdate=20 December 2015|publisher=Medscape|date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lifestyle diseases ===
Lifestyle diseases are a new concept from the second half of the 1900s. Tobacco use and increases in cholesterol levels show a strong correlation to higher risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;

=== Mental health ===
Mental health services are part of the Norwegian special health care services. In some cases this includes involuntary mental health treatment.&lt;ref name="Psykisk helsevern"&gt;[[:no:Psykisk helsevern|Psykisk helsevern]]{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The four regional health service institutions, owned by the state, receive fixed economic support from the state budget. They are responsible for special health services including mental health care in hospitals, institutions, district mental health centers, child and adolescent mental health services and nursing homes.&lt;ref name=" Psykisk helsevern i spesialhelsetjenesten"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helsedirektoratet|title=Psykisk helsevern i spesialhelsetjenesten|url=http://www.helsedirektoratet.no/finansiering/finansieringsordninger/psykisk-helse/spesialisthelsetjenesten/Sider/default.aspx|accessdate=2014-09-02|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to providing treatment, the mental health care services provide research, education for health personnel, and follow-up of patients and their relatives.&lt;ref name="Psykisk helsevern i spesialhelsetjenesten"/&gt;

There are different sectors within the mental health services. District mental health centers are responsible for general mental health service. They have outpatient facilities, inpatient facilities and emergency teams. Patients can be referred to the district mental health center by a general practitioner for diagnosing, treatment or admission.&lt;ref name="Distriktspsykiatrisk senter"&gt;[[:no:Distriktspsykiatrisk senter|Distriktspsykiatrisk senter]]{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are specialized centers, ideally at central hospitals, for children and adolescents, the elderly, and severe cases such as drug addiction, personality disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders etc.&lt;ref name="Distriktspsykiatrisk senter"/&gt;  Normally people who are discharged from treatment at central hospitals are referred to the district mental health centers for follow-up and treatment. Treatment can consist of [[psychotherapy]] with or without medications. Physical treatments, such as [[electroconvulsive therapy]], are used for specific disorders. Treatment usually starts at the hospital, with the aim of continuing treatment at home or at the district mental health center.&lt;ref name="Distriktspsykiatrisk senter"/&gt;

==== Children and adolescents ====
Child and adolescent mental health outpatient facilities offer mental health care for children and adolescents between 0–17 years of age. Central child and adolescent mental health service is aimed at challenges which cannot be handled in the regional state facilities, such as the general practitioner, school nurse, school, outreach services for youth and child services. The child and adolescent mental health services work closely with psychologists, child psychiatrists, family therapists, neurologists, social workers etc. Their aim is to diagnose and treat psychiatric disorders, behavioral disorders and learning disorders in close collaboration with care givers.&lt;ref name="Barne- og ungdomspsykiatri"&gt;[[:no:Barne- og ungdomspsykiatrisk poliklinikk|Barne- og ungdomspsykiatri]]{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For patients below the age of 16, parents must consent to admission.&lt;ref name="Barne- og ungdomspsykiatri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tvungent psykisk helsevern"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helsedirektoratet|title= Tvungent psykisk helsevern|url= https://helsenorge.no/psykisk-helsevern/tvungent-psykisk-helsevern|accessdate=2014-09-02|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Involuntary care ====
Involuntary mental health care in Norway is divided into inpatient and outpatient facilities and observation.&lt;ref name=" Tvungent psykisk helsevern"/&gt; In involuntary inpatient facilities patients can be held against their will, and can be picked up by the police if needed.&lt;ref name=" Tvungent psykisk helsevern"/&gt; In involuntary outpatient services the patient lives at home or is voluntarily in an institution, but regularly has to report to the district mental health center. These patients cannot be held against their will, but can be picked up by the police in the case of missed appointments.&lt;ref name=" Tvungent psykisk helsevern"/&gt; For involuntary observation in hospital a person can be held for up to ten days, or in some cases for twenty days, in order for the hospital to decide whether the criteria for involuntary mental health care are met.&lt;ref name=" Tvungent psykisk helsevern"/&gt; The control committee has as their main task to ensure that every patient’s rights are secured and protected in a meeting with involuntary care.&lt;ref name="Kontrollkommisjonen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helsedirektoratet|title=Kontrollkommisjonen|url= https://helsenorge.no/psykisk-helsevern/kontrollkommisjonen|accessdate=2014-09-02|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Financing ====
Mental health services are financed through needs-based basic funding to the regional health services, outpatient clinic refunding, deductibles and ear-marked grants from the state budget. Rates for outpatient work are partly based on hours worked and partly based on procedures; there are rates for diagnosing, treatment and follow-up per telephone or in collaborative meetings. In addition patients pay a deductible for outpatient consultations.&lt;ref name="Psykisk helsevern i spesialhelsetjenesten"/&gt;

==== Burden of disease ====
A survey done in 2011 showed that 10.2% of the population of Norway reported to have experienced symptoms of anxiety and depression within the last two weeks.&lt;ref name="Psykiske plager - et betydelig folkehelseproblem"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Folkehelseinstituttet|title=Psykiske plager - et betydelig folkehelseproblem|url= http://www.fhi.no/eway/default.aspx?pid=239&amp;trg=Content_6496&amp;Main_6157=6263:0:25,6336&amp;MainContent_6263=6496:0:25,6348&amp;Content_6496=6178:89102::0:6276:27:::0:0|accessdate=2014-09-02|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lifetime prevalence of severe depression is estimated to be 15.6%. Treatment and social services for the mentally ill cost society about 70 million Norwegian kroner (more than 10 million US dollars) yearly.&lt;ref name="Fakta om psykisk helse"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norsk Psykologforening|title=Fakta om psykisk helse|url=http://www.psykol.no/Foreningen/For-pressen/Fakta-om-psykisk-helse|accessdate=2014-09-02|year=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908155417/http://www.psykol.no/Foreningen/For-pressen/Fakta-om-psykisk-helse|archivedate=2014-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current health status ==
Norway has a birth register, death register, cancer register, and population register, which enables to authorities to have an overview of the health situation in Norway. The total population in Norway as of 2012, was 4,994,000. The life expectancy at birth was 80 years for males and 84 years for females. The under five mortality per 1000 live births in 2012 were three cases. The probability of dying between 15 and 60 years for males is 73 and 44 for females per 1000 in population. The total expenditure on health per capita (international dollars) was 5,970. Total expenditure on health as percentage of GDP was 9%. Gross national income per capita (PPP international dollars) is 66,960.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/countries/nor/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

A new measure of expected [[human capital]] calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by the [[The Lancet|Lancet]] in September 2018. Norway had the seventh highest level of expected human capital with 25 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lim |first1=Stephen |last2=et |first2=al |title=Measuring human capital: a systematic analysis of 195 countries and territories, 1990–2016 |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31941-X/fulltext |accessdate=5 November 2018 |publisher=Lancet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diseases of affluence ===
A wealthy economy makes it possible to buy tobacco, fast food, sweet drinks, and sweets that few people had access to or could afford until after 1950. These days many people have desk jobs, cars, and less demanding housework. In large, physical activity is decreasing, electronics, computers, social media, and the internet demands more of daily life. Drugs have also become more available in society. ‘New living conditions’ such as these give rise to new challenges for public health.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt; Only 30 percent of adults in Norway are fulfilling the advice to stay physical active for 150 minutes per week.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fhi.no/eway/default.aspx?pid=239&amp;trg=Content_7242&amp;Main_6157=7239:0:25,8904&amp;MainContent_7239=7242:0:25,8907&amp;Content_7242=7244:110551::0:7243:3:::0:0&lt;/ref&gt; In Norway today, municipalities have a higher health responsibility then earlier. Preventing diseases from birth should be prioritized in public health.

=== Smoking ===
{{See|Smoking in Norway}}
In Norway in 2008, approximately 17% of adult men used [[snus]] daily or occasionally, while 4% of adult women used snus daily or occasionally.&lt;ref name="fact sheet" /&gt; In secondary schools  in 2000-2004, 21% of boys and 4% of girls used snus daily or occasionally.&lt;ref name="fact sheet" /&gt; Many people both smoke and use snus.&lt;ref name="fact sheet"&gt; {{cite web
| url=  http://www.fhi.no/eway/default.aspx?pid=238&amp;trg=MainLeft_5976&amp;MainArea_5811=5976:0:15,5012:1:0:0:::0:0&amp;MainLeft_5976=5825:84434::1:5977:23:::0:0
| title= Smoking in Norway - fact sheet 
| publisher=  Norwegian Institute of Public Health
| date=  2010
| accessdate = 2012
}} &lt;/ref&gt;  

The proportion of smokers is higher among immigrants to Norway  than among ethnic Norwegians.&lt;ref name="fact sheet" /&gt; The highest proportion of smokers can be found among immigrants from [[smoking in Turkey|Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[Vietnam]] and [[smoking in Pakistan|Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="fact sheet" /&gt;

=== Non-communicable diseases ===
Diseases in the 21st century that are dominating in Norway are cardiovascular diseases, cancer, COPD, and diabetes. Technological progress and development within medical treatment have since the 1970s had huge impact on survival of diseases and especially cardiovascular diseases.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt; Elders suffer from disabilities and chronic diseases such as cancer, dementia, and pain disorders. Elderly often have multiple diseases simultaneously, which together affect functional capacity, quality of life, and mental health.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;

=== Social differences in health ===
The living standard of the Norwegian population has increased, though there are still differences between educational groups. Those with higher education and economy have generally the best health status. New public health legislation (Folkehelseloven) came into play in 2012, and the purpose of this act is to contribute to a society that promotes public health and evens out social inequalities in health.&lt;ref name="Folkehelse i Norge 1814 - 2014"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3599">In the post-Soviet era, reduced funding has put the health system in poor condition. In 2002 [[Turkmenistan]] had 50 hospital beds per 10,000 population, less than half the number in 1996. Overall policy has targeted specialized inpatient facilities to the detriment of basic, outpatient care. Since the late 1990s, many rural facilities have closed, making care available principally in urban areas. President [[Niyazov]]’s 2005 proposal to close all hospitals outside [[Ashgabat]] intensified this trend. [[Physicians]] are poorly trained, modern medical techniques are rarely used, and medications are in short supply.  Doctors and pharmacists were required to study the works of Avicenna and tested on their knowledge of [[Saparmyrat Niyazov]]'s spiritual writings, the [[Ruhnama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Grim reality of Turkmen health care |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/4440148.stm |accessdate=25 November 2018 |publisher=BBC |date=16 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 Niyazov dismissed 15,000 medical professionals, exacerbating the shortage of personnel. In some cases, professionals have been replaced by military conscripts. Private health care is rare, as the state maintains a near monopoly. Free public health care was abolished in 2004.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Turkmenistan.pdf Turkmenistan country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (February 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

Niyazov's successor, [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]] was a dentist, and took a rather more positive approach to healthcare. Money was invested to modernize the health-care sector, building gleaming new medical facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pictures Of Health: Real State Of Turkmen Medical Care A Far Cry From Official Images |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/25317046.html |accessdate=25 November 2018 |publisher=Radio Free Europe |date=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initiated an annual Month of Health and Sports, which involved people throughout the country taking long walks in parks and  compulsory physical fitness classes at workplaces.  $56 million was spent on an ophthalmology complex in [[Ashgabat]] and $47 million in a traumatology centre.  The rural hospitals reopened, but they had severe shortages of the most basic medical equipment and hygiene standards were poor.  Theoretically the state-funded health insurance covers part of the cost of hospital treatment and medication in public medical facilities, but there are widespread reports of bribery and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Real State Of Turkmen Medical Care A Far Cry From Official Images |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/turkmenistan-health-care-shortcomings/25322982.html |accessdate=25 November 2018 |publisher=Radio Free Europe |date=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an acute shortage of clinical staff and political pressure, for example discouraging from diagnoses of HIV .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hope for health in Turkmenistan? |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)61133-8/fulltext |accessdate=25 November 2018 |publisher=Lancet |date=20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a considerable flow of medical tourism from patients looking for more reliable health systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkmenistan healthcare in coma |url=http://enews.fergananews.com/articles/3042 |accessdate=25 November 2018 |publisher=Fergana News |date=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5278">The [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD) is the code used for the purpose of documenting a person's medical condition. It is usually important for [[health insurance]] reimbursement, administration, [[epidemiology]], and [[research]]. Of the approximately 7,000 [[rare disease]]s, only about 500 have a specific code. An ICD code is needed for a person's medical records—it is important for health insurance [[reimbursement]], administration, epidemiology, and research. Finding the best ICD code for a patient who has a rare disease can be a challenge.&lt;ref name = NIH2016&gt; {{cite web | date = 24 June 2016 | accessdate = 25 July 2017 | title = ICD Coding for Rare Disease | url = https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/guides/pages/123/icd-coding-for-rare-diseases}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different versions of the ICD code exist worldwide. The United States currently uses the [[ICD-10-CM]], a Clinical Modification of the WHO standard for diagnoses adapted for insurance reimbursement and billing purposes. This version allows for further breakdown of a code, which increases diagnosis specificity. Currently, published material that reference ICD-9-CM codes, which were used before October 1, 2015; however, not every code in the ICD-9-CM has a corresponding code in ICD-10-CM. Europe and other parts of the world use the [[ICD-10]]. The root codes for ICD-10 and ICD-10-CM are the same, making it helpful for locating codes for general body systems and disease processes.&lt;ref name = NIH2016/&gt;  

A good place to start is to contact an advocacy organization for the rare disease. These organizations are often aware of how the condition has been coded for other patients with the same diagnosis and may be able to recommend one or more codes to use. Many disease [[advocacy]] organizations also have medical advisory boards or physician directories, which can help to find someone with experience coding for that particular condition. A search can be done on the GARD website for a list of disease advocacy organizations. A GARD Information Specialist can be contacted directly for assistance.&lt;ref name = NIH2016/&gt;

Orphanet is a European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orphanet outlines the ICD-10 coding rules for rare diseases included in their database. The Orphanet database also often includes coding information for the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and more. When a diagnosis has not been established, or when a code does not exist for a specific rare disease, general coding guidelines indicate that it is acceptable to use codes that describe signs and symptoms.&lt;ref name="NIH2016" /&gt;  

==Other versions== 
Several online resources can help locate ICD codes:
*'''WHO ICD-10 Version: 2016''' – A searchable online version of ICD-10 that allows users to search by hierarchy or by entering the disease name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en|title=ICD-10 Version:2016|website=apps.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Orphanet''' – A European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs that includes ICD-10 codes, disease summaries, prevalence data, and more. Some of the ICD-10 codes given to a disease are assigned by Orphanet and not the WHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/Disease_Search.php?lng=EN|title=Orphanet: Search a disease|first=INSERM US14 -- ALL RIGHTS|last=RESERVED|website=www.orpha.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = NIH2016/&gt;

'''ISMETT''', in [[Italian language|Italian]], '''Istituto Mediterraneo per i Trapianti e Terapie ad Alta Specializzazione''' translated as the '''Mediterranean Institute for Transplantation and Advanced Specialized Therapies''', is a center for organ transplantation located in [[Palermo]], [[Italy]]. ISMETT was founded in 1997 as a partnership between the [[Sicily|Region of Sicily]], the Civico and Cervello hospitals in Palermo, and the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] (UPMC).&lt;ref name=ISMETT&gt;[http://www.ismett.edu/?q=it/system/files/ISMETT.doc Istituto Mediterraneo per i Trapianti e Terapie ad Alta Specializzazione (ISMETT)]&lt;/ref&gt;

ISMETT primarily specializes in performing all types of [[organ transplantation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ismett.edu/?q=it/trapianti Trapianti e terapie]&lt;/ref&gt; using both deceased and living donor techniques. ISMETT has 70 beds (14 [[Intensive care unit|ICU]], 21 in semi-intensive, and 35 inpatient), 7 outpatient beds, 4 operating rooms, a hospital pharmacy and laboratory analysis, infectious diseases and pathology in a facility that covers an area of  {{convert|130000|sqft|m2|sing=on}}.

==History==
The idea of creation of the Institute stemmed from a group of [[Hepatology|hepatologists]] at a hospital in Palermo that proposed to the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] (UPMC) the idea of a multi-organ transplant center to be realized in [[Sicily]]. Its creation was also prompted by a 1995 law passed in the United State that capped the total number of foreign patients that can be placed on a waiting list for transplants at 5%. For this reason, transplant leaders in [[Pittsburgh]] began looking toward opportunities in Europe and participated actively in the creation of a transplant center in Palermo. On May 23, 1996, the idea was presented to the Ministry of Health, who welcomed the project.

The first director was Ignazio R. Marino who performed the first successful liver transplantation in Sicily on July 31st, 1999. Ignazio R. Marino's team performed the first 100 solid organ transplantations of ISMETT.

On March 20, 1997, the [[:it:Conferenza permanente per i rapporti tra lo Stato, le Regioni e le Province autonome|State-Region Conference]] officially approved the creation and clinical management of ISMETT in accordance with art. 9/bis of Legislative Decree no. 502/92&lt;ref name=ISMETT /&gt; and proceeded with construction of the new institute. The construction began in 1999 with the laying of a foundation stone and was completed in 2004 when the new center opened its doors.

As of 2007, ISMETT had revenues of  € 2,270,000.  Its [[chairman]] was Camillo Ricordi, with Bruno Gridelli serving as its [[director-general]] and Ugo Palazzo serving as its director of health

==Transplant activities==
ISMETT began its clinical activity in 1999. On July 31, 1999 it performed its first [[Liver transplantation|liver transplant]] from a cadaveric donor in Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it/napoli/notizie/salute/2010/8-ottobre-2010/mille-trapianti-ismett-palermomarino-centro-miei-sogni-1703910397525.shtml Mille trapianti all'Ismett di Palermo. Marino: «È il centro dei miei sogni»]'', [[Corriere del Mezzogiorno]], October 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The same year ISMETT started a cadaveric and living donor [[kidney transplantation]] program. In 2004, ISMETT obtained permission to perform [[heart-lung transplant]]s, thus becoming a multi-organ transplant center.

In 2003 ISMETT started a pediatric liver transplantation program, and that year performed the first  children's transplant done in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Tiziana Lenzo, ''[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2003/07/05/nove-anni-un-fegato-nuovo-il-primo.html Nove anni, un fegato nuovo è il primo trapianto nel Sud]'', [[la Repubblica]], 5 luglio 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transplantation of HIV+ patients==
In 2001, [[Ignazio Marino]] performed the first living donor transplant into and [[HIV-positive people|HIV-positive patient]] in Italy, a procedure that created controversy and criticism,&lt;ref&gt;Tano Gullo, ''[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2001/08/30/ismett-dopo-il-trapianto-una-pioggia-di.html Ismett, dopo il trapianto una pioggia di richieste]'', [[la Repubblica]], 30 agosto 2001&lt;/ref&gt; including complaint from the Ministry of Health. The Ministry moved to censure Marino arguing that this particular type of transplant had the characteristics of clinical trials that required special authorization. That patient transplanted by Dr. Marino is still alive and enjoying an excellent quality of life free of dialysis, 16 years after the kidney transplant. Because of this success the rules in Italy have been changed and now HIV-positive patients are not any longer denied access to transplantation if they need it.

In 2007, for the first time in the world, an ISMETT team led by Dr. Bruno Gridelli performed a lung transplant on an HIV positive patient &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.repubblica.it/2007/05/sezioni/scienza_e_tecnologia/trapianto-polmone-sieropositivo/trapianto-polmone-sieropositivo/trapianto-polmone-sieropositivo.html Trapianto polmoni su sieropositivo. E' la prima volta al mondo]'', [[la Repubblica]], 25 maggio 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the intervention was authorized by the Ministry and was included within an experimental program launched by the National Transplant Center. This time, no controversy was recorded and the procedure received congratulatory press.

In 2007, the Regenerative Medicine and Cell Therapy Unit (Unità di Medicina Rigenerativa e Terapie Cellulari), termed the Cell Factory, was opened at ISMETT with the aim to initiate a program of regenerative medicine that researches the reparation of damaged organs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ismett.edu/?q=it/node/360 Cell factory - Unità di Medicina rigenerativa]&lt;/ref&gt; The mobile production laboratories (GMP Facility) of the unit have been made part of a project sponsored by the Region of Sicily and the Budget and Finance under the "ICT for the excellence of the territories."

Among the research trials carried out at the Cell Factory is the injection of fetal [[hepatocyte]]s as a therapy to bridge the patients waiting for a liver transplant, [[Islet cell transplantation|transplantation of pancreatic islets for patients with diabetes type 1]], and transplantation of human fetal skin cells for the treatment of lesions of the skin.

==The Center for Simulation==
The Center for Simulation became active at ISMETT in June, 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ismett.edu/?q=it/centro_fiandaca Centro di Simulazione]&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim to prevent and reduce medical errors. The use of simulation for training staff is already quite widespread in certain sectors such as aviation, and has now spread into the medical field. The simulation center provides for the implementation of higher risk procedures without risk to personnel and without involving patients.

The center has five life-sized and technologically sophisticated simulator mannequins that can mimic the signs and symptoms of real patients. The center was created thanks to a donation from the Foundation Fiandaca. The training activities of the Centre, which is open to all health care providers, began in January, 2008 .

An '''impairment rating''' is a percentage intended to represent the degree of an individual's impairment, which is a deviation away from one's normal health status and functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cocchiarella|first=Linda|title=Master the AMA Guides Fifth: A Medical and Legal Transition to Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition|year=2001|publisher=AMA Press|location=Chicago, Ill|isbn=978-1579471040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impairment is distinct from [[disability]]. An individual's impairment rating is based on the restrictive impact of an impairment, whereas disability is broadly the consequences one's impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Oosterom|first=FJ|author2=Ettema AM |author3=Mulder PG |title=Impairment and disability after severe hand injuries with multiple phalangeal fractures|journal=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2935">'''The International Radon Project (IRP)''' is a [[World Health Organization]] initiative to reduce the [[lung cancer]] risk around the world.

The IRP released their guidance to member countries in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241547673_eng.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to [[radon]] in the home and workplace is one of the main risks of [[ionizing radiation]] causing tens of thousands of deaths from lung cancer each year globally. In order to reduce this burden it is important that national authorities have methods and tools based on solid scientific evidence and sound public health policy. The public needs to be aware of radon risks and the means to reduce and prevent these.

In 1996 WHO published a report containing several conclusions and recommendations covering the scientific understanding of radon risk and the need for countries to take action in the areas of risk management and risk communication.

Recent findings from case-control studies on lung cancer and exposure to radon in homes completed in many countries allow for substantial improvement in risk estimates and for further consolidation of knowledge by pooling data from these studies. The consistency of the findings from the latest pooled analyses of case-control studies from Europe and North America as well as China provides a strong argument for an international initiative to reduce indoor radon risks.

To fulfill these goals, WHO has developed a program on public health aspects of radon exposure. This project enjoys high priority with WHO's Department of Public Health and Environment. The key elements of the International Radon Project include:

*Estimation of the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]] (GBD) associated with exposure to radon, based on the establishment of a global radon database 
*Provision of guidance on methods for radon measurements and mitigation 
*Developing evidence-based public health guidance for Member States to formulate policy and advocacy strategy including the establishment of radon action levels 
*Development of approaches for radon risk communication. 

To achieve these aims WHO has formed a network of key partner agencies from some 40 Member States. This network is the basis for the WHO International Radon Project which was launched in 2005. Working groups will collect and analyse information on radon risk, radon policies, radon mitigation and prevention as well as risk communication. The project members meet regularly and work towards achieving the outlined objectives.

The '''International Symposium on Endovascular Therapy (ISET)''' is an educational meeting for physicians, scientists, engineers and allied health professionals working in the multidisciplinary field of peripheral and cardiac interventional medicine. The meeting provides information on the latest techniques and technology for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of vascular diseases, among them [[stroke]], [[heart attack]], [[aneurysm]] and hardening of the arteries. The meeting highlights life-saving procedures that are considered{{By who|date=January 2015}} less invasive than traditional surgery.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The five-day course was founded in 1989 by interventionist Barry Katzen, M.D., the founder and medical director of the Miami-based Baptist Cardiac &amp; Vascular Institute (BCVI), which presents the meeting.  

The ISET meeting is presented annually in South Florida and draws attendees and prominent faculty speakers from around the world. In addition to Dr. Katzen, the following serve as course directors and are responsible for the meeting’s programming: James F. Benenati, M.D.; Alex Powell, M.D.; Ramon Quesada, M.D.; Shaun Samuels, M.D.; and Constantino Peña, M.D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7199">The '''International Ventilator Users Network''' ('''IVUN''')&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ventusers.org/  Homepage of International Ventilator Users Network&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[nonprofit]] network of [[mechanical ventilation]] users, respiratory health professionals, and ventilatory equipment manufacturers.  Its focus is on the health and [[independent living]] of ventilator users, whether they are using assisted ventilation long-term – at home or in nursing facilities—or short-term in emergency rooms and critical care units.

Many ventilator users have neuromuscular conditions, such as respiratory [[polio]] or [[post-polio syndrome]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), [[muscular dystrophy]], [[spinal muscular atrophy]] (SMA), [[spinal cord injury]] (SCI), or [[congenital central hypoventilation syndrome]] (CCHS). Historically, IVUN’s efforts have been primarily addressed to ventilator users with neuromuscular conditions.  But people who have [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) or [[obesity hypoventilation syndrome]] may also need to use assisted ventilation.

== Mission==
IVUN’s mission is “to enhance the lives and independence” of ventilator users “through education, advocacy, research, and networking”  among ventilator uses, respiratory health professionals, and ventilatory equipment manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;IVUN homepage.&lt;/ref&gt;   Support comes from individual members, donors, and sponsors.

IVUN’s parent organization is [[Post-Polio Health International]] (PHI).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.post-polio.org/  PHI homepage.&lt;/ref&gt; It shares that organization’s headquarters and staff in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], as well as its volunteer Board of Directors.  IVUN’s publications, website, and volunteer advisory boards are its own, however.

==Current activities==
===Education===
IVUN publishes (both online and in print) authoritative medical information based on interaction between ventilator users and healthcare professionals.  Currently, users can find online free of charge a 16-page introductory document describing the history of ventilators, the various types of ventilators, and the types of user-interfaces;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ventusers.org/edu/vabout1.html  ''Information about Ventilator-Assisted Living''.&lt;/ref&gt;  a packet of documents dealing with emergency medical care for home ventilator users (checklists for users, caregivers, physicians, and [[Emergency medical services]] personnel);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ventusers.org/vume/index.html Emergency Medical Care for Ventilator Users.&lt;/ref&gt; and a comprehensive Home Ventilator Guide which provides technical information on home/portable ventilator equipment from manufacturers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ventusers.org/edu/index.html ''Home Ventilator Guide''&lt;/ref&gt;  Past issues of IVUN’s quarterly newsletter, ''Ventilator-Assisted Living'', are also online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ventusers.org/edu/valnews/index.html ISSN 1066-534X&lt;/ref&gt; IVUN’s staff maintain a telephone answer-line and  answer e-mail inquiries during business hours.

=== Networking===
IVUN publishes, and makes available free online, the ''Resource Directory for Ventilator-Assisted Living'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ventusers.org/net/index.html  ''Resource Directory for Ventilator-Assisted Living''&lt;/ref&gt; which lists respiratory health professionals who are  experts in long-term assisted ventilation, ventilatory equipment manufacturers and their contact information, and organizations whose members use assisted ventilation.  IVUN’s website manages an equipment exchange, a peer-to-peer advice page, and ventilator news digests.

IVUN staff regularly attend medical meetings and international conferences on home ventilator use, and coordinate presentations by ventilator users at medical meetings such as those for the [[American College of Chest Physicians]] (ACCP).  In addition, IVUN/PHI’s periodic international conferences present many sessions relevant to ventilator users.

===Advocacy and Research===
With respect to advocacy and research, IVUN’s activities are integrated with those of PHI.   A recent research grant of direct relevance to ventilator users is a study, conducted in 2005 by a team at [[Johns Hopkins University]], on the “Timing of Noninvasive Ventilation for Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.” An earlier research award (2001) went to researchers at the [[University of Toronto]], [[Canada]] for a study on ”Ventilator Users'  Perspectives on the Important Elements of Health-Related Quality of Life.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ventusers.org/res/index.html Research Awards&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
IVUN was formally established under that name in 1987, but its roots go back to the polio epidemics of the 1940s and 1950s, when the possibility of long-term survival with mechanically assisted ventilation became a reality. Beginning in 1949, IVUN’s founder, [[Gini Laurie]], was an [[American Red Cross]] volunteer in the polio wards of Cleveland’s City Hospital, and later in the part of that hospital (Toomey Pavilion) that became one of the 15 respiratory care and rehabilitation hospitals funded by the [[March of Dimes]].  Those centers all across the country began to close after the polio epidemics in the [[United States]] ended. Laurie, however, was determined to keep the respiratory polio survivors in touch with each other, and with their medical specialists.

She did this first by taking over the editorship of Toomey Pavilion’s alumni newsletter, the ''Toomeyville Jr. Gazette'', and circulating it widely throughout the United States.  Copies also went to individuals and organizations in [[Canada]], [[Great Britain]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]]. In 1960, her informal organization of volunteers was incorporated under the name Iron Lung Polio Assistance, and her newsletter grew into a magazine called the ''Toomey j. Gazette''.  In 1964, the organization changed its name to Iron Lung Polios and Multiplegics, to reflect more accurately Laurie’s cross-disability concerns. The magazine became the ''Rehabilitation Gazette'' in 1970, carrying a wide range of articles on [[independent living]] for people with physical disabilities.  Laurie soon became one of the central figures in the development of the [[independent living movement]] and in the founding of the [[Centers for Independent Living]] in the United States.

Laurie’s central concerns, however, always included ventilator users.  Specifically, they concerned finding ways for ventilator users to leave hospitals and nursing homes with the support necessary for them to live active, effective lives as members of their communities.  As some cross-disability organizations such as the [[American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities]] (ACCD) dissolved into disability-specific organizations, IVUN was formed to make sure there were publications and networks specifically for long-term ventilator users.

[[File:Ziziphus zizyphus MHNT.BOT.2012.10.26.jpg|thumb|''Ziziphus zizyphus'' – [[MHNT]]]]

'''''Ziziphus jujuba''''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ζίζυφον'', ''zízyphon''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dzi%2Fzufon ζίζυφον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;), commonly called '''jujube'''&lt;ref name=GRIN&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|uː|dʒ|uː|b}}; sometimes jujuba), '''red date''', '''Chinese date''',&lt;ref name=GRIN/&gt; '''Korean date''',{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} or '''Indian date'''{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}  is a species of ''[[Ziziphus]]'' in the [[buckthorn]] [[family (biology)|family]] ([[Rhamnaceae]]).

==Description==
[[File:Zizyphus jujuba Blanco1.59.png|thumb|left|Plate from the book ''Flora de Filipinas'']]
It is a small [[deciduous tree]] or [[shrub]] reaching a height of {{convert|5|–|12|m}}, usually with thorny branches. The [[leaf|leaves]] are shiny-green, ovate-acute, {{convert|2|–|7|cm}} long and {{convert|1|–|3|cm}} wide, with three conspicuous veins at the base, and a finely toothed margin. The [[flower]]s are small, {{convert|5|mm|abbr=on}} wide, with five inconspicuous yellowish-green petals. The [[fruit]] is an edible oval [[drupe]] {{convert|1.5|–|3|cm}} deep; when immature it is smooth-green, with the consistency and taste of an [[apple]], maturing brown to purplish-black, and eventually wrinkled, looking like a small [[date palm|date]]. There is a single hard kernel, similar to an [[olive|olive pit]],&lt;ref name="rushforth" /&gt; containing two seeds.

==Distribution==
Its precise natural distribution is uncertain due to extensive cultivation, but is thought to be in southern Asia, between Lebanon, northern India, and southern and central China, and possibly also southeastern Europe though more likely introduced there.&lt;ref name=rushforth&gt;Rushforth, K. (1999). ''Trees of Britain and Europe''. Collins {{ISBN|0-00-220013-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This plant has been introduced in Madagascar and grows as an invasive species in the western part of the island. This plant is known as the "hinap" or "finab" in the eastern part of Bulgaria where it grows wild but is also a garden shrub, kept for its fruit. The fruit is picked in the autumn. The trees grow wild in the eastern Caribbean, and are reported to exist in Jamaica, The Bahamas, and Trinidad as well. In Antigua and Barbuda, the fruit is called "dumps" or "dums"; and in The Bahamas, "juju". It is also known as "pomme surette" on the French islands of the Caribbean. This fruit, more precisely known as "Indian jujube" elsewhere, is different from the "jujube" fruit that is cultivated in various parts of southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/indian_jujube.html|title=Indian Jujube|website=www.hort.purdue.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crfg.org/pubs/ff/jujube.html|title=JUJUBE Fruit Facts|website=www.crfg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Altun Ha]] an ancient [[Mayan city]] in [[Belize]], located in the [[Belize District]] about 50 kilometres (31&amp;nbsp;mi) north of [[Belize City]] and the surrounding woods also boasts some jujube tree and shrub varieties  where it is referred to as plums for lack of a better word among locals.

==Nomenclature==
The species has a curious nomenclatural history, due to a combination of botanical [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|naming regulations]], and variations in spelling. It was first described scientifically by [[Carl Linnaeus]] as ''Rhamnus zizyphus'', in ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753. Later, in 1768, [[Philip Miller]] concluded it was sufficiently distinct from ''[[Rhamnus (plant)|Rhamnus]]'' to merit separation into a new genus, which he named ''Ziziphus jujube'', using Linnaeus' species name for the genus but with a probably accidental single letter spelling difference, "i" for "y". For the species name he used a different name, as [[tautonymy|tautonyms]] (repetition of exactly the same name in the genus and species) are not permitted in botanical naming. However, because of Miller's slightly different spelling, the combination the earlier species name (from Linnaeus) with the new genus, ''Ziziphus zizyphus'', is ''not'' a tautonym, and was therefore permitted as a botanical name. This combination was made by [[Gustav Karl Wilhelm Hermann Karsten|Hermann Karsten]] in 1882.&lt;ref name=rushforth/&gt;&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;Clarke, D. L. (1988). ''W. J. Bean Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles'', Supplement. John Murray {{ISBN|0-7195-4443-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a proposal was made to suppress the name ''Ziziphus zizyphus'' in favor of ''Ziziphus jujuba'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kirkbride |first1=Joseph H. |last2=Wiersma |first2=John H.|last3=Turland |first3=Nicholas J. |year=2006 |title=(1753) Proposal to conserve the name ''Ziziphus jujuba'' against ''Z. zizyphus'' (Rhamnaceae) |journal=Taxon |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=1049–1050 |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iapt/tax/2006/00000055/00000004/art00039 |accessdate=30 January 2013 |doi=10.2307/25065716}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this proposal was accepted in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barrie |first1=Fred R. |year=2011 |title=Report of the General Committee: 11 |journal=Taxon |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=1211–1214 |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iapt/tax/2011/00000060/00000004/art00026 |accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ziziphus jujuba'' is thus the correct scientific name for this species.

==Cultural and religious references==
In Arabic-speaking regions the jujube and alternatively the species ''[[Ziziphus lotus|Z. lotus]]'' are closely related to the [[Sidrat al-Muntaha|lote-trees]] (sing. "sidrah", pl. "sidr") which are mentioned in the [[Quran]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Abdullah, Yusuf Ali]] (1946) ''The Holy Qur-an. Text, Translation and Commentary'', Qatar National Printing Press. p.1139, n. 3814.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sidrah (Lote-Tree) and the Sidrat al-Muntaha  (Lote-Tree of the Extremity): Some Apects of their Islamic and Bābī-Bahā'ī Iintepretations. |author=Stephen Lambden |quote=This is apparently the wild jujube or ''Zizyphus spina-christi''  (Christ's thorn), a tall, stout, tropical tree (see image above) with dense prickly branches which produces a sweet reddish fruit similar to that of the jujube (the `unnāb = ''[[Zizyphus vulgaris]]'' / fruit) |url=http://www.hurqalya.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/baha'i%20encyclopedia/SIDRAH-SIDRAT-BE.htm |accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] it is rather the species ''[[Ziziphus spina-christi|Z. spina-christi]]'' that is called ''sidr''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Illustrated Bible Dictionary and Treasury of Biblical History, Biography, Geography, Doctrine, and Literature |author=[[Matthew George Easton|Easton, M.G., M.A., D.D.]] |year=1893 |location=London, Edinburgh and New York |publisher=T. Nelson and Sons |page=688 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
Varieties of jujube include Li, Lang, Sherwood, Silverhill, So, Shui Men and GA 866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://garden.org/plants/group/jujubes/ |title= Jujubes: Plant Care and Collection of Varieties |website = garden.org |author= Edward T. Hager |access-date= 5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation and uses==
[[File:Ziziphus jujuba.jpg|thumb|left|''Ziziphus jujuba'', written in ''[[Monbusho]]'' chant lyrics. It is now located in [[General]] [[Nogi]]'s residence.]]
Jujube was domesticated in [[south Asia]] by 9000 BC.&lt;ref name=gupta54&gt;Gupta, Anil K. "Origin of agriculture and domestication of plants and animals linked to early Holocene climate amelioration", ''Current Science'', Vol. 87, No. 1, 10 July 2004, 59. Indian Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 400 [[cultivar]]s have been selected.

The tree tolerates a wide range of temperatures and rainfall, though it requires hot summers and sufficient water for acceptable fruiting. Unlike most of the other species in the genus, it tolerates fairly cold winters, surviving temperatures down to about {{convert|−15|°C}}. This enables the jujube to grow in mountain or desert habitats, provided there is access to underground water throughout the summer. The jujube, ''Z. jujuba'' grows in cooler regions of Asia. Five or more other species of ''Ziziphus'' are widely distributed in milder climates to hot deserts of Asia and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;S. Chaudhary. "Rhamnaceae" in: S. Chaudhary (Ed). ''Flora of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia''. Vol II (Part One) 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Madagascar]], jujube trees grow extensively in the western half of the island, from the north all the way to the south. It is widely eaten by free-ranging [[zebu]]s, and its seeds grow easily in zebu feces. It is  an [[invasive species]] there, threatening mostly protected areas.

===Culinary use===
The freshly harvested, as well as the candied [[dried fruit]], are often eaten as a snack, or with coffee. Smoked jujubes are consumed in  Vietnam and are referred to as black jujubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seasonalchef.com/jujubes.htm |title=Rare Fruit: Jujubes |publisher=Seasonalchef.com |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both China and Korea produce a sweetened tea syrup containing jujube fruit in glass jars, and canned jujube tea or jujube tea in the form of teabags. To a lesser extent, jujube fruit is made into juice and jujube [[Vinegar#Fruit|vinegar]] (called [[wikt:枣|枣]][[wikt:醋|醋]] or [[wikt:红枣|红枣]][[wikt:醋|醋]] in Chinese). They are used for making pickles (কুলের আচার) in west Bengal and Bangladesh. In China, a wine made from jujube fruit is called ''hong zao jiu'' (红枣酒).

Sometimes pieces of jujube fruit are preserved by storing them in a jar filled with ''[[baijiu]]'' (Chinese liquor), which allows them to be kept fresh for a long time, especially through the winter. Such jujubes are called ''jiu zao'' (酒枣; literally "alcohol jujube"). The fruit is also a significant ingredient in a wide variety of Chinese delicacies.{{which|date=June 2014}}

In Vietnam and Taiwan, fully mature, nearly ripe fruit is harvested and sold on the local markets and also exported to [[Southeast Asia]]n countries.&lt;ref name="LIM"/&gt; The dried fruit is used in desserts in China and Vietnam, such as ''[[ching bo leung]]'', a cold beverage that includes the dried jujube, longan, fresh seaweed, barley, and lotus seeds.&lt;ref name="LIM"&gt;{{Cite book| others = Lim, T.K.| year = 2013| title = Edible Medicinal and Non-Medicinal Plants| volume = Volume 5, Fruits| publisher = Springer Science+Business Media| location = Dordrecht| ISBN = 978-9400756526| pages = 580
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Korea, jujubes are called ''daechu'' (대추) and are used in ''[[daechucha]]'' teas and ''[[samgyetang]]''.

In Croatia, especially [[Dalmatia]], jujubes are used in marmalades, juices, and ''[[rakija]]'' (fruit brandy).

On his visit to [[Medina]], the 19th-century English explorer, [[Sir Richard Burton]], observed that the local variety of [[Sidrat al-Muntaha|jujube]] fruit was widely eaten. He  describes its taste as "like a bad plum, an unrepentant cherry and an insipid apple." He gives the local names for three varieties as "Hindi (Indian), Baladi (native), Tamri (date-like)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Francis Burton|Burton, Sir Richard Francis]] (1855) ''A Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah'' pp.404,405&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] a hundred years ago, a close variety was common in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan valley]] and around [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew George Easton|Easton, M.G., M.A., D.D.]] (1893) 'Illustrated Bible Dictionary and Treasury of Biblical History, Biography, Geography, Doctrine, and Literature With Numerous Illustrations and Important Chronological Tables and Maps.'' T. Nelson and Sons, London, Edinburgh and New York. p.688. "It overruns a great part of the Jordan valley."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bedouin]] valued the fruit, calling it ''nabk''. It could be dried and kept for winter or made into a paste which was used as bread.&lt;ref&gt;[[Grace Crowfoot|Crowfoot, M. Grace]] with [[Louise Baldenserger]]  (1932) ''From Cedar to Hyssop. A study in the Folklore of Plants in Palestine''. The Sheldon Press, London. pp.112,113&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Persian cuisine]], the dried drupes are known as ''annab'', while in neighboring [[Azerbaijan]], it is commonly eaten as a snack, and is known as ''innab''. Confusion in the common name apparently is widespread. The ''innab'' is ''Z. jujuba'': the local name ''ber'' is not used for ''innab''. Rather, ''ber'' is used for three other cultivated or wild species, e.g., ''Z. spina-christi'', ''Z. mauritiana'', and ''Z. nummularia'' in Pakistan and parts of India and is eaten both fresh and dried. The Arabic name ''sidr'' is used for ''Ziziphus'' species other than ''Z. jujuba''.

Traditionally in India, the fruit is dried in the sun and the hard nuts are removed. Then, it is pounded with [[tamarind]], [[red chillies]], [[salt]], and [[jaggery]]. In some parts of the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]], fresh whole ripe fruit is crushed with the above ingredients and dried under the sun to make cakes called ''ilanthai vadai'' or ''regi vadiyalu'' ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kamalascorner.com/2008/12/indian-jujube-elanthai-pazham.html |title=Kamala's Corner: Indian Jujube – Elanthai Pazham |publisher=Kamalascorner.com |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also commonly consumed as a snack.

In Northern and Northeastern India the fruit is eaten fresh with salt and chilli flakes and also preserved as candy, jam or pickle with oil and spices. 

In Madagascar, jujube fruit is eaten fresh or dried. People also use it to make jam. A jujube honey is produced in the [[Atlas Mountains]] of Morocco.&lt;ref name="LIM"/&gt;

[[Italy]] has an alcoholic syrup called ''brodo di giuggiole''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quoquo.it/la-galleria-dei-beni-culturali/178-la-pastinaca-di-santu-pati|title=La pastinaca di Santu Pati|website=www.quoquo.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Senegal Jujube is called Sii dem and the fruit is used as snack. The fruit is turned into dried paste used by school kids.

The [[Jujube_(confectionery)|commercial jujube candy]] popular in movie theaters originally contained jujube juice but now uses other flavorings.

===Medicinal use===

The '''Lazzaretto''' ({{lang-mt|Lazzarett}}) is a former [[lazaret|quarantine facility]] and [[hospital]] on [[Manoel Island]] in [[Gżira]], [[Malta]]. It is a complex of various buildings dating back to between the 17th and 19th centuries. Most of the structures still exist, although they are in a bad state due to damage sustained during World War II and over 30 years of abandonment. It is planned that the Lazzaretto be restored.

From 1526 onwards, [[Marsamxett Harbour]] began to be used for quarantine purposes. During the {{Interlanguage link multi|Maltese plague of 1592–1593|fr|3=Épidémie de peste à Malte en 1592-1593|lt=plague of 1592–93}}, a temporary lazzaretto was constructed on the island in the middle of the harbour, then known as the ''Isolotto'' and now called [[Manoel Island]]. Some warehouses a chapel dedicated to [[Saint Roch]] were also built at this point, but they were demolished in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name=melitensiawth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cassar|first1=Paul|title=A Tour of the Lazzaretto Buildings|journal=Melita Historica|date=1984|volume=9|issue=4|pages=369-380|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.09(1984-87)/MH.9(1984)4/orig05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1643, the Grand Master of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]], [[Giovanni Paolo Lascaris]], decided to build a permanent lazzaretto due to fears of an epidemic. The Order acquired the island from the Church by exchanging it with some property at ''Tal-Fiddien''. The Lazzaretto as built by Lascaris consisted of a single building, but a second block was built and expanded by Grand Masters [[Nicolas Cotoner]] in 1670, [[Gregorio Carafa]] in 1683, [[Ramon Perellos y Roccaful]] in 1701 and [[António Manoel de Vilhena]] in around 1726. In 1797, Grand Master [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]] built a new block and some warehouses in the Lazzaretto.&lt;ref name=melitensiawth/&gt;

[[Image:Malta; view of the quarantine area. Etching by M-A. Benoist, Wellcome L0019027.jpg |thumb|250px|left|View of [[Manoel Island]] in 1720]]
The Lazzaretto was also used as a hospital, and it saw a lot of use during the plague epidemic of 1813–14, the cholera epidemic of 1865 and the plague epidemic of 1937. It also served as a military hospital for British, French and Italian soldiers during the [[Crimean War]]. Several notable figures stayed in the Lazzaretto throughout its history, including [[Lord Byron]], Sir [[Walter Scott]], [[Horace Vernet]], [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[Alphonse de Lamartine]].&lt;ref name=melitensiawth/&gt;

Part of the Lazzaretto which was known as the Profumo Office was used to fumigate incoming mail. [[Disinfected mail]] was marked with red wax seals from around 1816 to 1844, while a variety of cachets were used later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[JB Catalogue|The JB Catalogue of Malta Stamps and Postal History]]|date=2014|publisher=Sliema Stamp Shop Publishers|location=[[Sliema]]|pages=239–240|edition=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disinfection of mail on a large scale lasted until the 1880s, but was used in rare cases up to 1936.&lt;ref name=melitensiawth/&gt;

The Lazzaretto remained in use by the health authorities until 1939, when it was requisitioned by the [[Admiralty]] to be used for military purposes during [[World War II]]. Between 1941 and 1942, it was used as a submarine depot, and the buildings were bombed a number of times by Italian or German aircraft. Many buildings were destroyed by this aerial bombardment, and some other structures had to be demolished due to the damage they had sustained.&lt;ref name=melitensiawth/&gt;

The Lazzaretto reopened as a hospital in 1949, and remained so until the departure of the [[Royal Navy]] from Malta in the 1970s. It was subsequently abandoned, and it fell into a state of disrepair.&lt;ref name=midi/&gt;

Since its closure, part of the Lazzaretto was also used as a shelter for abandoned dogs.&lt;ref name=midi/&gt;

===Present day===
Today, the Lazzaretto is in a state of neglect, and parts of it have collapsed while others are in danger of collapsing.&lt;ref name=midi&gt;{{cite web|title=The Restoration of The Lazaretto|url=http://www.midimalta.com/restoration-lazaretto|website=MIDI plc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025214739/http://midimalta.com/restoration-lazaretto|archivedate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lazzaretto is set to be restored by the development company MIDI plc, who also restored the nearby [[Fort Manoel]] and [[Fort Tigné]]. The planned restoration would include treatment of the existing stonework and reconstruction of destroyed structures. After restoration, the complex is to be converted into residences, offices, restaurants, a casino and a boutique hotel.&lt;ref name=midi/&gt; An underground car park is also planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Debono|first1=James|title=Manoel Island’s Lazzaretto to be ‘resurrected’ as casino, offices|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/15311/manoel-island-s-lazzaretto-to-be-resurrected-as-casino-offices-20120118#.VnMzIPkrLIU|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=18 January 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217221435/http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/15311/manoel-island-s-lazzaretto-to-be-resurrected-as-casino-offices-20120118|archivedate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex is a Grade 2 national monument, and it is listed on the [[National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands]].&lt;ref name=nicpmi&gt;{{cite web|title=Lazzaretto|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01169.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216224306/http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01169.pdf|archivedate=16 December 2015|date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Malta - Gzira - Manoel Island - Lazzaretto (MSTHC) 05 ies.jpg|thumb|left|Old Palace]]

The Lazzaretto consists of a complex of buildings dating back to the 17th to 19th centuries. Nothing remains of the original 16th century temporary structure, and the oldest extant building within the complex is that built in 1643 during the magistracy of Grand Master Lascaris. This structure, which is known as the ''Palazzo Vecchio'' (Old Palace), the ''Palazzo Grande'' (Great Palace) or simply ''il-Palazz'' (the Palace), is two stories high and consists of eight halls built around a central [[courtyard]]. This building had a number of coats of arms on its façade, but these were defaced probably during the [[French occupation of Malta]]. The building also has two marble inscriptions, one undated and another dated 1787, while a third inscription dated 1797 was removed in the late 1960s. A copy of marble inscription dated 1814 is also affixed on the western façade of the building. The original inscription was affixed on a [[gallows]] in front of [[Fort Manoel]], and it is now in storage in Valletta.&lt;ref name=melitensiawth/&gt;

The complex also contains a building known as the New Palace, which was built in stages between the 1670s and the early 18th century. This block consists of warehouses built around two courtyards, and the façade facing the sea contains a series of high arches. The easternmost warehouse was demolished after it was bombed in World War II.&lt;ref name=melitensiawth/&gt;

[[File:Malta - Gzira - Manoel Island - Lazzaretto (Ix-Xatt Ta' Xbiex) 02 ies.jpg|thumb|New Palace]]

In the 18th century, a Pest House was built near the Old Palace for the isolation of patients suffering from the plague. A number of cattle sheds for the quarantining of animals were also built nearby. The Pest House was demolished to make way for a Disinfection Station, while the cattle sheds were destroyed in the war.&lt;ref name=melitensiawth/&gt;

Between the Pest House and the Old Palace, there is the De Rohan Block which was completed in 1797. The Profumo Office was located near the De Rohan Block, but the building was destroyed in the war.&lt;ref name=melitensiawth/&gt;

The Lazzaretto complex was surrounded by a high wall to prevent people from escaping. Six cemeteries were located in the area, but only one still exists today.&lt;ref name=melitensiawth/&gt;

A number of historical graffiti can be found within the Lazzaretto, with the earliest dated 1681 and the latest 1947.&lt;ref name=melitensiawth/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17347">'''Life story work''' is a social work [[Psychological intervention|intervention]] with children and adults designed to recognise their past, present, and future. It is prominently used with children who will be adopted, and older adults as part of [[reminiscence therapy|reminiscence therapies]]. '''Life story books''' are often incorporated into this work to give a visual aid and reminder of important events or feelings.

==Origins==

Life story work as a concept has dated back to at least the 1960s, possibly further.&lt;ref name=Aust&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aust|first=Patricia H.|title=Using the Life Story Book in Treatment of Children in Placement|journal=Child Welfare|date=September–October 1981|volume=60|issue=8|pages=535}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the concept to children in foster care and adoption was discussed in academia from the early 1980s onward.&lt;ref name=BAAF/&gt; Life story work is well documented in the UK and Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of adolescence|year=2012|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=1441916954|editor=Levesque, Roger J. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been incorporated into UK Adoption legislation. More recently it has been used in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=BAAF/&gt;

==Preparing and planning==
[[Social worker]]s should take the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that children who are expected to be adopted or to be in long term care have a life story book.&lt;ref name="Bedfordshire LSW"&gt;{{cite web|last=Blake|first=Jo|title=Life story work with Looked After Children|url=http://www.bedfordshire.gov.uk/Resources/PDF/HealthAndSocialCare/LookedAfterChildrenPoliciesAndProcedures/QualityOfLife/Policy%20on%20Life%20story%20work%2006.pdf|work=Children Looked After Policy and Procedures|publisher=Bedfordshire County Council|accessdate=13 December 2012 |author2=Neil Candlish |author3=Maureen Cavanagh |author4=Tom Murphy |author5=Fiona MacKirdy |author6=Katherine Peddie |author7=Julie-Anne Saunders |author8=Vivienne White|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social workers often hold the most factual information about the child's background and reasons for becoming Looked After or Adopted and it is important that they provide this information for use in the life story work.&lt;ref name="LSW with traumatized Children"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rose|first=Richard|title=The child's own story : life story work with traumatized children|year=2005|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|location=London|isbn=9781843102878|pages=49–50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2sCVe7DYWVIC&amp;dq=social+worker+providing+factual+information+for+life+story+work&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|edition=[Online-Ausg.].|author2=Terry Philpot |author3=Mary Walsh }}&lt;/ref&gt; Day-to-day carers such as; [[Foster Care]]rs, [[Residential care|Residential Support Worker]]s or [[Adoption|Adoptive Parents]] can offer the best informal life story work. They have the information about the day-to-day events in the child's life, their milestones and achievements.&lt;ref name=Somerset&gt;{{cite web|title=Life Story Work|url=http://www.n-somerset.gov.uk/carewizard/North_Somerset_Life_Story_Procedure_for_Children_in_Care.htm|publisher=North Somerset Council|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birth Parents are a critical part of the life story work with adopted children as they can offer information to construct a family tree and provide pictures or descriptions of family members.&lt;ref name="Life Story Work Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Tony|title=Life story work : a practical guide to helping children understand their past|year=2007|publisher=British Association for Adoption &amp; Fostering|location=London|isbn=9781905664023|pages=15–17|edition=New|author2=Walker, Rodger }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some suggest that life story work can be completed by any adult who is able and willing to spend time with the child and build a trusting relationship.&lt;ref name="Life Story Work Guide" /&gt; However, some feel that some professionals such as student social workers, trainees and foster carers should not be encouraged to complete the life story work as they may not have the experience, training or ability to support the child with life story work over a long enough period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nottinghamshire County Council|title=Life Story Work and Preparation for Adoption|url=http://nottinghamshirechildcare.proceduresonline.com/chapters/p_life_story_prep.html#when_life|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person's needs must be taken into account regarding the gender, ethnicity, religion or culture of the adult assisting with the life story work.&lt;ref name=Somerset /&gt;

==Techniques==

===Life story books===
Life story books have been a part of adoption social workers' practice for over 30 years; though the quality of them has varied.&lt;ref name=Goldberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldberg|first=Joy Rees ; foreword by Alan Burnell ; illustrated by Jamie|title=Life story books for adopted children : a family friendly approach|year=2009|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|location=London|isbn=9781843109532}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should take around 12 months to complete it&lt;ref name=BAAF&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Tony Ryan, Rodger|title=Life story work|year=2003|publisher=British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering|location=London|isbn=1873868103|edition=2nd rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it may need to be updated as the child's understanding develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicholls|first=Edith A.|title=The new life work model : practice guide|year=2005|publisher=Russell House|location=Lyme Regis|isbn=1903855810}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life story work is distinct from life story books, the process of life story work is to assist the person to understand and internalise the feelings associated with their past. However, a life story book does not need to involve the person and can be done by others, this is especially the case when done by social workers before placing a child for adoption. Rees &amp; Goldberg state that a life story book should not include professional reports, later life letters, structured chronology (though this could be recorded in another, more child friendly, format), photo album and should not be an extension of the foster carer's memory book.&lt;ref name=Goldberg /&gt; However, life story books can often be seen as complementary or as an end product to life story work.&lt;ref name=Somerset /&gt;
A life story book is a system of recording information to answer the questions the participant may have in the future.&lt;ref name=Goldberg /&gt; It is an overview of a person's life to help them recall memories and understand their past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fahlberg|first=Vera I.|title=A child's journey through placement|year=2003|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|location=London|isbn=978-1849058988|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A child who does not fully understand their history is at risk of developing an imagined story of fictional family members leading to a misplaced sense of identity as they mature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kammer|first=Betsy Keefer and Jayne E. Schooler ; illustrated by Jack G. and Kristi Anne|title=Mystery history : helping your foster-adopted child understand the past|year=2000|publisher=Bergin &amp; Garvey|location=Westport|isbn=0897896912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, life story books are written from the perspective of the Past-Present though it has been suggested that writing it in this way causes the child anxiety as past issues may be too painful to come to terms with. Therefore, it has been suggested that a new approach: ‘Present – Past – Present – Future’ allows the child to feel that their life with their current family is secure and symbolically encourages the child to feel contained by their family.&lt;ref name=Goldberg /&gt;

===Interactive approach===
It has been identified that [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] can assist with the presentation of life story work such as amending colour schemes to make it personal to the individual, and correcting spelling or grammatical errors. Hardware peripherals such as scanners, digital cameras and printers are also useful.&lt;ref name=SCIE&gt;{{cite web|title=Using ICT in activities for people with dementia|url=http://www.scie.org.uk/publications/ictfordementia/lifestoryactivities.asp|publisher=Social Care Institute for Excellence|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer programmes have been developed to complete life story work with children in a way which they feel comfortable and do not find threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahmad|first=Afshan|title=My Life Story CD Rom|url=http://www.baaf.org.uk/bookshop/cd_lifestory|publisher=British Association of Adoption &amp; Fostering|accessdate=13 December 2012|author2=Betts, Bridget }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital life story work ===
The importance of digital technologies and digital media in the lives of children and young people has seen a growth in interest of the ability of these technologies to support [[Human self-reflection|self-reflection]] and build [[Narrative paradigm|narrative coherence]]. In seeking to make the benefits of conventional life story work accessible to adolescents, Hammond and Cooper&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Digital-Life-Story-Simon-Hammond/dp/1907585672 Hammond, S. P. &amp; Cooper, N. J. (2013)] Digital life story work: Using technology to help young people make sense of their experiences. London: BAAF.&lt;/ref&gt; integrate the ideas of [[narrative psychology]] and build upon established approaches of undertaking life story work with younger children. Recognising that adolescents communicate differently than younger children, Hammond and Cooper incorporate a range of accessible digital technologies to provide interactive and practical activities which aim to support practitioners to empower adolescents to take the lead in the creation of, and reflection upon, their own [[Autobiography|autobiographical narratives]].

===Story-telling===
Creating stories for children that can create a link between their lives and behaviour and that of a fiction character can develop their understanding of why they think and feel the way they do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lacher|first=Denise B.|title=Connecting with kids through stories using narratives to facilitate attachment in adopted children|year=2005|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|location=London|isbn=978-1843107972|author2=Nichols, Todd |author3=May, Joanne C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service user groups==

===Adoption===
The Children's Rights Director in England found that 71% of adopted children thought it was important to know about their lives before adoption. Specific questions that these children wanted answers to included why they were adopted and why they could not stay with birth families.&lt;ref name="Rights4Me - About Adoption"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgon|first=Roger|title=About Adoption: A Children's Views Report|year=2006|publisher=Office of the Children's Rights Director: Commission for Social Care Inspection|location=Newcastle upon Tyne, England, UK|pages=28–29|url=https://www.rights4me.org/~/media/Library%20Documents/Reports/Reports%202006/REPORT%20About%20Adoption.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Adoption and Children Act 2002]] outlines the Local Authorities' and Adoption Agencies' expectations to provide information regarding individual's history upon request.&lt;ref name="Adoption and Children Act 2002"&gt;{{cite web|last=Legislation.gov.uk|title=Adoption and Children Act 2002: Chapter 38|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/38/pdfs/ukpga_20020038_en.pdf|publisher=The Stationery Office, UK|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Guidance relating to this Act specifically mentions Life Story Work to help them 'explore and understand their early history and life before their adoption'.&lt;ref name="Adoption Statutory Guidance"&gt;{{cite web|last=Department for Education|title=Adoption Statutory Guidance: The Adoption and Children Act 2002|url=http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/s/master%20version%2021%20february%202011%20with%20amdts%201%20and%202%20included%201%20june%202012%20final%20version.pdf|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fostering===
Some Local Authorities in the UK have developed procedures which outline the need for all children who are Looked After to have life story work completed with them; usually in conjunction with the social worker and foster carer. Much of the foster carer's role is to collect items for the child's memory box or book and to encourage the child to participate.&lt;ref name=Somerset /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Telford &amp; Wrekin Council|title=4.13.4 Life Story Work|url=http://telfordchildcare.proceduresonline.com/chapters/p_life_story_work.html|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dementia===
{{details|Reminiscence therapy}}

Life story work is used for people with [[dementia]] to support them to be able to tell the story of their life and to create visual tools to help their memories of past events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life Stories|url=http://www.dementiacare.org.uk/index.php/living-well-with-dementia/i-am-a-carer-or-friend/planning-for-today-or-tomorrow/life-stories/life-stories|publisher=Dementia Care|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Present and future goals or plans should be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=E.|title=Reminiscing with people with dementia : a handbook for carers|year=1999|publisher=Age Exchange|location=London|isbn=978-0947860257|author2=Hodgeson, S. |author3=Schweitzer, P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=F.|author2=Carson, Y. |title=Life Story Work in Practice; Aiming for Enduring Change|journal=Journal of Dementia Care|date=May–June 2010|volume=18|issue=3|pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been found to be beneficial as a therapeutic tool for family members to assist in reviewing the person's life and enabling them to remember the person prior to the onset of dementia.&lt;ref name=McKeown&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKeown|first=Jane|author2=Clarke, Amanda |author3=Ingleton, Christine |author4=Ryan, Tony |author5= Repper, Julie |title=The use of life story work with people with dementia to enhance person-centred care|journal=International Journal of Older People Nursing|date=1 June 2010|volume=5|issue=2|pages=148–158|doi=10.1111/j.1748-3743.2010.00219.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Staff and carers of the person may also find it a useful tool to help them better care for a person. Furthermore, research shows that families feel reassured about staff care after life story work has been completed.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=R|title=Realising the potential: Developing life story work in practice.|journal=Foundation of Nursing Studies Dissemination Series|year=2010|volume=5|issue=5|url=http://www.dementiauk.org/assets/files/info_and_support/Realising_the_Potential.pdf|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also identified by staff to be a fun and interesting activity to do with dementia patients.&lt;ref name=McKeown /&gt;
Life story work should identify a person's achievements throughout life so this can allow the person with dementia to feel proud of themselves.&lt;ref name=McKeown /&gt;
Life story work has been linked to person centred/individualised care of people with dementia&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life Story Work|url=http://www.dementiauk.org/information-support/life-story-work/|publisher=Dementia UK|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and national UK guidelines make particular reference to staff being able to learn about individuals' life stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dementia: Supporting people with dementia and their carers in health and social care|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/10998/30318/30318.pdf|publisher=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence &amp; Social Care Institute for Excellence|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning disabilities===
An Australian study of ex-prisoners with 'intellectual' disabilities suggested that life story work may be beneficial to allow this group of people to better communicate their experiences.&lt;ref name="LSW Ex-prisoners"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellem|first=K|author2=Wilson, J |title=Life Story Work &amp; Social Work Practice: a case study with ex-prisoners labelled as having an intellectual disability|journal=Australian Social Work|year=2012|volume=63|issue=1|pages=67–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been identified as a tool to promoting self-advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meininger|first=Herman|title=Narrating, Writing, Reading: Life Story Work as an Aid to (Self) Advocacy|journal=British Journal of Learning Disabilities|date=September 2006|volume=34|issue=3|pages=181–188|doi=10.1111/j.1468-3156.2006.00416.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of life story work==
Research conducted within in-patient older adult mental health wards found that there was sometimes a shortage of qualified staff to complete the work and a reluctance to get involved due to other commitments and responsibilities. There were also limits to the amount of time they had available to complete the work and access to resources such as computers and scanners was identified as a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=R.|title=Realising the potential:Developing life story work in practice|journal=Foundation of Nursing Studies Dissemination Series|year=2010|volume=5|issue=5|editor1-first=K.; Shaw, T.|editor1-last=Sanders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Luvos Heilerde.jpg|thumb|German medicinal clay ([[Luvos]] ''Heilerde'') consisting of [[loess]], i.e., a mixture of sand, clay, and silt]]

The use of '''medicinal clay''' in [[folk medicine]] goes back to prehistoric times. Indigenous peoples around the world still use [[clay]] widely, which is related to [[geophagy]]. The first recorded use of medicinal clay goes back to ancient [[Mesopotamia]].

A wide variety of clays are used for medicinal purposes—primarily for external applications, such as the clay baths in health spas ([[mud therapy]]). Among the clays most commonly used are [[kaolin]] and the [[smectite]] clays such as [[bentonite]], [[montmorillonite]], and [[Fuller's earth]].

==Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia==

The first recorded use of medicinal clay is on Mesopotamian clay tablets around 2500 B.C. Also, ancient Egyptians used clay. The Pharaohs’ physicians used the material as anti-inflammatory agents and antiseptics. It was used as a preservative for making mummies and is also reported that Cleopatra used clays to preserve her complexion.&lt;ref name="ASU research"&gt;{{cite press release |url= https://asunow.asu.edu/content/attacking-mrsa-metals-antibacterial-clays |title= Attacking MRSA with metals from antibacterial clays |publisher= Arizona State University |date= 17 May 2013 |accessdate= 20 October 2017 |first= Richard |last= Harth |work= ASU Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= https://biodesign.asu.edu/news/%E2%80%9Chealing-clays%E2%80%9D-hold-promise-fight-against-mrsa-superbug-infections-and-disease |title= 'Healing clays' hold promise in fight against MRSA superbug infections and disease |date= 7 April 2008 |accessdate= 20 October 2017 |last= Coulumbe |first= Margaret |publisher= The Biodesign Institute: Arizona State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ebers Papyrus]] of about 1550 BC (but containing the tradition going back many centuries earlier) is an important medical text from ancient Egypt. It describes the use of [[ochre]] for a wide variety of complaints, including for intestinal problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url= http://www.macalester.edu/~cuffel/ebers.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050226100008/http://www.macalester.edu/~cuffel/ebers.htm |archive-date= 26 February 2005 |date= 1937 |translator-first= B |translator-last= Ebbell |publisher= Levin &amp; Munksgaard |location= Copenhagen |title= The Papyrus Ebers: The Greatest Egyptian Medical Document |website= www.macalster.edu |ref=CITEREFEbers Papyrus1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for various eye complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dianabuja.wordpress.com/2010/06/21/eyes-and-the-papyrus-ebers/ |title= 'Recipes' for Treating the Eyes: Papyrus Ebers |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110104231643/http://dianabuja.wordpress.com/2010/06/21/eyes-and-the-papyrus-ebers/ |archive-date= 4 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |author= dianabuja |type= Blog |date= 21 June 2010 |website= wordpress.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2017}}

==Classical times==

===Lemnian clay===

This was a clay used in Classical Antiquity. It was mined on the island of [[Lemnos]]. Its use continued until the 19th century, as it was still listed in an important pharmacopoeia in 1848&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |first1= Olle |last1= Selinus |first2= BJ |last2= Alloway |title= Essentials of medical geology: Impacts of the natural environment on public health |publisher= Academic Press |date= 2005 |isbn= 0-12-636341-2 |page= 446 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the deposits may have been exhausted by then).

[[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]] reports about the Lemnian earth:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Mystery and Art of the Apothecary |first= CJS |last= Thompson |location= London |publisher= John Lane |date= 1929 |page= 44 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;if rubbed under the eyes, it moderates pain and watering from the same, and prevents the flow from the lachrymal ducts. In cases of haemorrhage it should be administered with vinegar. It is used against complaints of the spleen and kidneys, copious menstruation, also against poisons, and wounds caused by serpents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lemnian clay was shaped into tablets, or little cakes, and then distinctive seals were stamped into them, giving rise to its name ''[[terra sigillata]]''—Latin for 'sealed earth'. [[Dioscorides]] also commented upon the use of ''terra sigillata''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Another physician famous in antiquity, [[Galen]], recorded numerous cases of the internal and external uses of this clay in his treatise on clay therapy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Galen... used as one of his means for curing injuries, festering wounds, and inflammations ''terra sigillata'', a medicinal red clay compressed into round cakes and stamped with the image of the goddess Diana. This clay, which came from the island of Lemnos, was known throughout the classical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= H. |last= Van Der Loos |title= The Miracles of Jesus |location= Leiden, the Netherlands |publisher= Brill |date= 1965 |page= 82 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clay was prescribed by the Roman obstetrician, gynecologist, and pediatrician [[Soranus of Ephesus]], who practiced medicine around 100-140 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Soranus' gynecology |translator-first= Owsei |translator-last= Temkin |publisher= JHU Press |date= 1991 |edition= reprint |pages= 239–40 |isbn= 0-8018-4320-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other clays used in classical times===

The other types of clay that were famous in antiquity were as follows.

* ''Terra chia, Terra cymolia'' (Cimolean earth): these were both white earths and considered of great value.
* Samian earth: Pliny in c. 50 AD (Nat. Hist.) details two distinct varieties, ''colyrium'' - an eye salve, and ''aster'', which was used as a soap as well as in medicines.
* ''Terra sigillata strigoniensis'' (Strigian earth, derived from [[Silesia]]) - this clay, yellow in colour, appears to have been famous later in medieval times.

All the above seem to have been bentonitic clays.

* The earth which did not stain the hands was known as ''rubrica''.

===Medieval times===

In medieval Persia, [[Avicenna]] (980-1037 CE), the 'Prince of Doctors', wrote about clay therapy in his numerous treatises.

[[Ibn al-Baitar]] (1197–1248), a Muslim scholar born at Malaga, Spain, and author of a famous work on pharmacology, discusses eight kinds of medicinal earth.{{refn|group=notes|For further discussion see:&lt;br&gt;

# the ''terra sigillata'',
# Egyptian earth,
# Samian earth,
# earth of Chios,
# Cimolean earth or pure clay (cimolite), soft earth, called ''al-hurr'', green in color like verdigris, is smoked together with almond bark to serve as food when it will turn red and assume a good flavor; it is but rarely eaten without being smoked—also called 'Argentiera',
# earth of vines called ''ampelitis'' (Pliny XXXV, 56) or ''pharmakitis'' from Seleucia in Syria,
# Armenian earth (also known as the [[Armenian bole]]), salutary in cases of bubonic plague, being administered both externally and internally,
# earth of Nishapur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Laufer |first=Berthold |title= Geophagy | location= Chicago |publisher= Field Museum Press|url=https://archive.org/stream/geophagy182lauf/geophagy182lauf_djvu.txt|year= 1930 |via= Archive.org |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance period===
A French naturalist [[Pierre Belon]] (1517–1564) was interested in investigating the mystery of the Lemnian clay. In 1543, he visited Constantinople where, after making enquiries, he encountered 18 types of different products marketed as Lemnian Earth (he was concerned about possible counterfeits).

He then made a special journey to Lemnos, where he continued his investigation, and tried to find the source of the clay. He discovered that it was extracted only once a year (on 6 August) under the supervision of Christian monks and Turkish officials.

==Preparation of clay==
Clay gathered from its original source deposit is refined and processed in various ways by manufacturers. This can include heating or baking the clay, since the raw clay tends to contain a variety of micro-organisms{{refn|group=notes|"Soil, including kaolinitic and montmorillonitic clays, contains considerable amounts of organic material, including many live microorganisms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc= 3020602 |pmid= 12971372 |last= Callahan |first= GN |title= Eating dirt |journal= Emerg Infect Dis |volume= 9 |issue= 8 |date= August 2003 |ref= harv |doi= 10.3201/eid0908.030033}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Too much processing, likewise, may reduce the clay's therapeutic potential. In particular, Mascolo et al. studied 'pharmaceutical grade clay' versus 'the natural and the commercial herbalist clay', and found an appreciable depletion of trace elements in the pharmaceutical grade clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mascolo | first1 = N | last2 = Summa | first2 = V | last3 = Tateo | first3 = F |display-authors= 2 | doi = 10.1016/S0169-1317(99)00037-X | title = Characterization of toxic elements in clays for human healing use | journal = Applied Clay Science | volume = 15 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 491–500 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = |ref=CITEREFMascolo, Summa et al.1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, certain clays are typically heated or cooked before use.{{refn|group= notes |An example of this is the medieval 'Argentiera' clay, mentioned in this article.}}

Medicinal clay is typically available in health food stores as a dry powder, or in jars in its liquid hydrated state – which is convenient for internal use. For external use, the clay may be added to the bath, or prepared in wet packs or poultices for application to specific parts of the body.

Often, warm packs are prepared; the heat opens up the pores of the skin, and helps the interaction of the clay with the body.{{refn|group=notes|"Hot application is recommended in geotherapy, pelotherapy or paramuds in beauty therapy..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Carretaro |first1= MI |last2= Gomes |first2= CSF |last3= Tateo |first3= F |display-authors= 2 |chapter= Clays and human health |editor1-last= Bergaya |editor1-first= F |editor2-last= Theng |editor2-first= BKG |editor3-last= Lagaly |editor3-first= G |display-editors= 2 |title= Handbook of Clay Science, Developments in Clay Science |volume= 1 |publisher= Elsevier Ltd |location= Amsterdam |date= 2006 |page= 723 |isbn= 0-08-044183-1 |ref=CITEREFCarretaro, Gomes et al.2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the European health spas, the clay is prepared for use in a multitude of ways – depending on the traditions of a particular spa; typically it is mixed with peat and matured in special pools for a few months or even up to two years.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The majority of spas … use artificial ponds where the natural ("virgin") clay is mixed with mineral, thermo-mineral, or sea water that issues in the vicinity of the spas or inside the spa buildings."{{sfnp|Carretaro, Gomes et al.|2006|p=724}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Trace minerals===
Clays contain large amounts of trace minerals. It is common to see as many as 75 different trace minerals in Montmorillonite clays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country= US |number= 6962718 |title= Compositions for treating animal diseases and syndromes |invent1= Ramaekers, Joseph C. |pubdate= 8 November 2005 |url= http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6962718.html}} (US patent). See: Table 1: Montmorillonite Components; Average Nutrient Content. Retrieved 20 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific trace minerals that various clays possess vary very widely. Also, the amount of any particular trace mineral in any specific clay varies a lot among clays from different locations. For example, the amount of [[iron]] in various bentonite clays can vary from well below 1%, and up to 10%.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Uses==

===Skin conditions===

Many types of skin conditions have been treated by the application of medicinal clay. Montmorillonite has shown its effectiveness in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Saary |first1= J |last2= Qureshi |first2= R |last3= Palda |first3= V |last4= DeKoven |first4= J |last5= Pratt |first5= M |last6= Skotnicki-Grant |first6= S |last7= Holness |first7= L |display-authors= 2 | date = November 2005 | title = A systematic review of contact dermatitis treatment and prevention. | url = | journal = J Am Acad Dermatol | volume = 53 | issue = 5| page = 845 |pmid= 16243136 |doi= 10.1016/j.jaad.2005.04.075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Guin | first1 = JD | title = Treatment of toxicodendron dermatitis (poison ivy and poison oak) | journal = Skin Therapy Letter | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 3–5 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11376396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lee |first1= YH |last2= Chen |first2= BY |last3= Lin |first3= FH |last4= Lin |first4= KY |last5= Lin |first5= KF |display-authors= 2 | year = 2008 | title = Cytotoxic assessment of L-ascorbic acid/montmorillonite upon human dermal fibroblasts in vitro: MTT activity assay. | url = | journal = Biomedical Engineering - Applications, Basis and Communications | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 337–43 | doi=10.4015/s1016237208000957}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Carretaro, Gomes et al.|2006|p=722}} It has also been used as a base ingredient for [[tissue engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zheng |first1= JP |last2= Wang |first2= CZ |last3=Wang |first3= XX |last4= Wang |first4= HY |last5= Zhuang |first5= H |last6= Yao |first6= KD |display-authors= 2 | year = 2007 | title = Preparation of biomimetic three-dimensional gelatin/montmorillonite-chitosan scaffold for tissue engineering | url = | journal = Reactive and Functional Polymers | volume = 67 | issue = 9| pages = 780–88 | doi=10.1016/j.reactfunctpolym.2006.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay is used in many dermatological over-the-counter remedies, such as in acne treatments (this information may not be mentioned on the label specifically).

===Internal use===

There are many over the counter remedies for internal use that contained clay before discontinuation. Examples include [[Kaopectate]] (Upjohn), Rheaban (Leeming Div., Pfizer), and Diar-Aid (Thompson Medical Co.). The labels on all of these showed the active ingredient to be [[Attapulgite]], each tablet containing 600 (or 750&amp;nbsp;mg) of this component along with inert materials or adjuvants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |number= 5079201 |country= US |title= Zeolite-clay composition and uses thereof |invent1= Chu, Pochen |invent2= Garwood, William E. |pubdate= 7 January 1992 |url= http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5079201.html}}. (US Patent). Retrieved 20 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, since April 2003, attapulgite medication was discontinued due to lack of evidence according to the U.S. Foods and Drugs Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Numerous medicines also use [[Kaolinite]] clay, which has long been a traditional remedy to soothe an upset stomach. Also, Kaolin is or has been used as the active substance in liquid anti-diarrhea medicines such as Kaomagma. Such medicines were changed away from aluminium substances due to a scare over Alzheimer's disease, but have since changed back to compounds containing aluminum as they are most effective.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Heavy metal chelation===

It has been used as a scientifically unsupported [[Chelation therapy|chelation treatment]] for heart disease and autism.&lt;ref name="AHA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4493 |deadurl= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080419070849/http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4493 |archive-date= 19 April 2008 |title= Chelation Therapy: AHA recommendations |publisher= American Heart Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IOM2004&gt;{{cite book |author= Immunization Safety Review Committee, Board on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, [[Institute of Medicine]] |title= Immunization Safety Review: Vaccines and Autism |publisher= The National Academies Press |location= Washington, DC |year=2004 |isbn=0-309-53275-2 |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10997.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oyanedel-Craver and Smith have studied sorption of four heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Zn and Hg) to 3 kinds of bentonite clay. The overall conclusion of the study was that the organoclays studied have considerable capacity for heavy metal sorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Oyanedel-Craver |first1= VA |last2= Smith |first2= JA | year = 2006 | title = Effect of quaternary ammonium cation loading and pH on heavy metal sorption to Ca bentonite and two organobentonites | url = | journal = J Hazard Mater | volume = 137 | issue = 2| pages = 1102–14 | doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.03.051| pmid = 16647204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aflatoxicosis===

It has been found that prolonged exposure to bentonite in humans can actually have harmful effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/ehc/ehc_231.pdf |title= Bentonite, Kaolin, and Selected Minerals |first1= Zoltán |last1= Adamis |first2= Richard B. |last2= Williams |location= Geneva |publisher= World Health Organization |date= 2005 |isbn= 9241572310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use by the NASA space program===
[[Image:Sedimentary-clay-mountain.jpg|thumb|A mountain of clay — [[Petrified Forest National Park]], Arizona. The white bands represent pure bentonite clay.]]
The effects of weightlessness on human body were studied by [[NASA]] in the 1960s.  Experiments demonstrated that weightlessness leads to a rapid bone depletion, so various remedies were sought to counter that. A number of pharmaceutical companies were asked to develop calcium supplements, but apparently none of them were as effective as clay. The special clay that was used in this case was Terramin, a reddish clay found in California. Benjamin Ershoff of the California Polytechnic Institute demonstrated that the consumption of clay counters the effects of weightlessness. He reported that "the calcium in clay ...is absorbed more efficiently ... [clay] contains some factor or factors other than calcium which promotes improved calcium utilization and/or bone formation." He added, "Little or no benefit was noted when calcium alone was added to the diet."&lt;ref name="research.calacademy.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ubick |first=Suzanne |title=Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud |url=http://research.calacademy.org/calwild/2005winter/stories/mud.html |work= California Wild |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004221952/http://research.calacademy.org/calwild/2005winter/stories/mud.html |archivedate= 4 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects of ingestion==
Substances discontinued such as [[kaolin]] and [[attapulgite]]  were formerly considered gastric [[demulcent]]s and diarrhea medication, until official studies by the USFDA disproved these views. Clays are classified as [[excipient]]s and their main side-effects are that of neutral excipients, which is to impair and slow down absorption of antibiotics, hormones and heart medication amongst others by coating the digestive tract &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.medicinenet.com/kaolin/supplements-vitamins.htm#Interactions |deadurl= no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160728063721/http://www.medicinenet.com/kaolin-page3/supplements-vitamins.htm#Interactions |archive-date= 28 July 2016 |title= Kaolin |page= Are there any interactions with medications? |nopp= yes |publisher= Medicinenet.com |date=  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this slowed down absorption can lead to increased toxicity of some medication (e.g. citrate salts) which can become toxic if not metabolized quickly enough, which is one contraindication of attapulgite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.drugs.com/cdi/attapulgite.html |title= Attapulgite Tablet |publisher= Drugs.com |date=  |archive-date= 26 May 2016 |deadurl= no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160526181135/http://www.drugs.com/cdi/attapulgite.html |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Usual mild side-effects are nausea, slowed down absorption of nutrients from food (in excess dosage of medicinal clay) and constipation.

==Common medicinal clays==

* [[Bentonite]]-type clay has been used to treat infections, indigestion, and other medical problems by both applying wet clay topically to the skin as a [[poultice]], and by ingesting it. Bentonite has been prescribed as a bulk laxative, and it is also used as a base for many dermatologic formulas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://food.oregonstate.edu/glossary/b/bentonite.html Bentonite] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801151406/http://food.oregonstate.edu/glossary/b/bentonite.html |date=2009-08-01 }} from oregonstate.edu website&lt;/ref&gt; Dermatologically, it is used as part of a treatment for [[pruritus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drugs.com/mmx/calamine.html Calamine] from www.drugs.com website&lt;/ref&gt; Bentonite itself is not classified as a [[carcinogenic]], but some bentonite may contain variable amounts of respirable crystalline silica, a human carcinogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maxim LD, Niebo R, McConnell EE |title=Bentonite toxicology and epidemiology - a review |journal=Inhal Toxicol |volume=28 |issue=13 |pages=591–617 |year=2016 |pmid=27809675 |doi=10.1080/08958378.2016.1240727 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Montmorillonite]] is the main constituent of bentonite.
* Attapulgite or [[palygorskite]] is a very absorbent clay, somewhat similar to bentonite. When used in medicine, it physically binds to acids and toxic substances in the stomach and digestive tract. For this reason, it has been used in several anti-diarrheal medications.
* [[Kaolin]] is not as absorbent as most clays used medicinally (it has a low [[shrink-swell capacity]]). Also, it has a low [[cation exchange capacity]]. This clay is also known as 'white cosmetic clay'. Clay, in the form of kaolin, was a common ingredient in western medicines such as [[Kaopectate]], [[Rolaids]] and [[Maalox]], but is no longer present in them nor in similar preparations, as it is considered ineffective by the USFDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/kaolin-page2/supplements-vitamins.htm |title=Kaolin Information &amp;#124; Evidenced-Based Supplement Guide on MedicineNet.com - How does Kaolin work? |publisher=Medicinenet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microperimetry''', sometimes called '''Fundus related perimetry''', is a type of [[visual field test]]&lt;ref&gt;Glaucoma Diagnosis, Structure and function, pp. 83-92. Edited by Robert N. Weinreb and Erik L. Greve. 2004 Kugler Publications, The Hague, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; which uses one of several technologies to create a "retinal sensitivity map" of the quantity of light perceived in specific parts of the retina&lt;ref&gt;Visual Fields, pp. 1-5. Edited by Oxford University Press. David B. Henson.&lt;/ref&gt; in people who have lost the ability to fixate on an object or light source.

==Usage==
[[File:Intermediate age related macular degeneration.jpg|thumb|Macular degeneration]]
Visual field testing is widely used to monitor pathologies affecting the periphery of vision such as [[glaucoma]].&lt;ref name="Markowitz2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Microperimetry and clinical practice: an evidence-based review|journal = Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology |date = 2013-10-01|issn = 0008-4182|pmid = 24093179|pages = 350–357|volume = 48|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.jcjo.2012.03.004|first = Samuel N.|last = Markowitz|first2 = Sophia V.|last2 = Reyes}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a conventional test, patients are asked to look steady (fixate) at a visual target, while light stimuli are projected at varying intensities in different retinal locations. This process is not, however, considered accurate in the evaluation of pathologies affecting the central part of the retina ([[macula]] and [[fovea centralis]]) patients with these pathologies are often unable to fixate reliably.

==Microperimetry with Biofeedback==

In patients with central vision loss, microperimetry experts are able to analyse the eccentric retina in order to find zones with good retinal sensitivity. Once the best retinal area is selected, patients are asked to move their gaze towards that direction, while audio signals guide them to the desired target. This process is called [[biofeedback]], and is based on the theory of brain plasticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tarita-Nistor L. |author2=Gonzalez E. G. |author3=Markowitz S.

[[File:Victor Ion Popa - Nicolae Lupu, 1922.png|thumb|260px|March 1922 caricature of Lupu, by [[Victor Ion Popa]]]]
'''Nicolae L. Lupu''' (November 4, 1876 – 1947) was a [[Romania]]n left-wing politician and social physician. Originally a leader of the [[Labor Party (Romania)|Labor Party]], which was joined with the [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]], Lupu served as [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Interior Minister]] in 1919–1920. He formed his own [[Peasants' Party–Lupu]] in 1927, and also steered the creation of a [[League Against Usury]]. His group became a dissident faction of the [[National Peasants' Party]], and was reestablished, after World War II, as the [[Democratic Peasants' Party–Lupu]].

==Career==
Nik Speakman started a finance company, Personal Money Management, aged 26 with his former partner and was working as a success coach at the time of his and Eva's 2005 appearance in ''That's Rich'', a [[Granada Television]] series focusing on entrepreneurs in the north west of England.&lt;ref name=MENApr05&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/tv-shares-tales-of-life-on-millionaires-1117189|title=TV shares tales of life on millionaires’ row|publisher=Manchester Evening News|date=25 April 2005|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eva Speakman ran the Heavenly Bodies gym in [[Oldham]], at the time of the show.&lt;ref name=MENApr05/&gt;

The Speakmans were subsequently hosts of a [[Living TV]] show, ''A Life Coach Less Ordinary'', and in 2007 published a book, ''You Can Be Fantastic, Too!''.&lt;ref name="Speakman2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nik Speakman|title=Your Life Can Be Fantastic Too!|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6HMXPQAACAAJ|date=1 November 2007|publisher=Goldwing Publishing Limited|isbn=978-0-9793965-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple hosted a [[television pilot]] for the American [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX network]], ''Panic Attack'', in 2010.&lt;ref name=HRApr10&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fox-orders-panic-attack-reality-23000|title=Fox orders 'Panic Attack'|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=26 April 2010|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second daytime television show, ''[[The Speakmans]]'', was broadcast by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. In ''The Speakmans'' they attempted to 'successfully treat ordinary people with extraordinary problems'.&lt;ref name=ROJul14&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rochdaleonline.co.uk/news-features/2/news-headlines/88212/the-speakmans|title=The Speakmans|publisher=Rochdale Online|date=9 July 2014|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show aired for 20 episodes, beginning on 14 July 2014.&lt;ref name="ITV"&gt;{{cite web|title=ITV - The Speakmans|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week29/speakmans|publisher=ITV.com|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Speakmans are regular columnists in 'Love It Magazine'. The couple regularly appears on  [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'' hosting a segment about anxiety issues and phobias.

The Speakmans use 'schema conditioning psychotherapy' to 'find and tackle the root cause of anxiety disorders'.&lt;ref name=MENJul14&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/nik-eva-speakman-speakmans-star-7413352|title=Celeb gurus Nik and Eva Speakman try to help people overcome anxiety disorders in new TV series|author=Emily Heward|publisher=Manchester Evening News|date=13 July 2014|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nik Speakman said of their approach on their television series that "We're really hoping people will look at it and think: 'I can apply that to my life.' Even if it’s an entirely different problem, ultimately our therapy is the same...That’s what we want. There's no need for anyone to suffer. There is absolute hope for everyone."&lt;ref name=MENJul14/&gt; The Speakmans also believe in "practising gratitude", asserting that "Everybody’s got problems and issues but equally everybody has got amazing things to be thankful for."&lt;ref name=MENJul14/&gt;

Therapeutic techniques utilized by the couple include putting clients into a [[DeLorean DMC-12]] sports car in order to 'travel 'back to the future' to confront past demons', a reference to the [[DeLorean time machine]] from the ''[[Back to the Future (franchise)|Back to the Future]]'' film series.&lt;ref name=MENJul10/&gt; The Speakmans presented a DeLorean car to the former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Rochdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochdale]], [[Cyril Smith|Sir Cyril Smith]], at his 80th birthday party in 2008.&lt;ref name=ROJun08&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rochdaleonline.co.uk/news-features/article/9569/sir-cyril-smith-80th-birthday-party|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123742/http://www.rochdaleonline.co.uk/news-features/article/9569/sir-cyril-smith-80th-birthday-party|archivedate=2 April 2015|title=Sir Cyril Smith - 80th Birthday Party|publisher=Rochdale Online|date=29 June 2008|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted celebrity clients of the Speakmans have included [[Peter Andre]], [[Kerry Katona]], [[Kym Marsh]], [[Liz McClarnon]], [[Katie Price]], [[Holly Willoughby]] and [[Jeremy Kyle]].&lt;ref name=MENJul10/&gt;&lt;ref name=MENJul14/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/speakmans-cure-jeremy-kyle-his-creepy-crawly-phobia |title=The Speakmans cure Jeremy Kyle of his creepy crawly phobia |publisher=Itv.com |date=13 July 2014 |accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Speakmans have diplomas in an unspecified subject from [[Newcastle University]],&lt;ref name=Guard06/&gt; but are not accredited psychotherapists.

In December 2015, The Speakmans appeared on [[BBC Radio 2|BBC Radio 2's Breakfast Show]] with [[Sara Cox]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Sara Cox sits in, The Chris Evans Breakfast Show - BBC Radio 2|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06s90hm|website = BBC|access-date = 2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
The Speakmans have lived in [[Littleborough, Greater Manchester|Littleborough]] near [[Rochdale]] in Greater Manchester since 2000.&lt;ref name=BPCitzJul141&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.blackpoolcitizen.co.uk/leisure/tv/interviews/1948119.Interview__Nik_and_Eva_Speakman/|title=Interview: Nik and Eva Speakman|publisher=Blackpool Citizen|date=16 July 2014|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MENJul14/&gt; The Speakmans converted their house from a former pub and restaurant into a nine-bedroomed house.&lt;ref name=MENJul10/&gt; The couple put their house up for sale in 2010 as they worked on the ''Panic Attack'' pilot in the United States, and planned to move to the south of England owing to their work in London and America.&lt;ref name=MENJul10/&gt;

The couple have two children and are supporters of a local children's home, the Duke Bar Burnley Wood NCH Children's Centre&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/leisure/tv/1948119.Interview__Nik_and_Eva_Speakman/?ref=ms&lt;/ref&gt;, and are Celebrity Ambassadors of Variety Children's Charity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.variety.org.uk/photos/i-love-a-bit-of-variety/the-speakmans&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cheshm manuscript.jpg|right|thumb|An Arabic manuscript, dated 1200CE, titled ''Anatomy of the Eye'', authored by [[al-Mutadibih]].]]

'''[[Ophthalmology]]''' was one of the foremost branches '''in medieval [[Islamic medicine]]'''. The oculist or ''kahhal'' (کحال), a somewhat despised professional in [[Galen]]’s time, was an honored member of the medical profession by the [[Abbasid]] period, occupying a unique place in royal households. Medieval Islamic scientists (unlike their classical predecessors) considered it normal to combine theory and practice, including the crafting of precise instruments, and therefore found it natural to combine the study of the eye with the practical application of that knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Science in the Middle Ages|author=[[David C. Lindberg]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1980|isbn=0-226-48233-2|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specialized instruments used in their operations ran into scores. Innovations such as the “[[Injection (medicine)|injection]] [[syringe]]”, a [[hypodermic needle|hollow needle]], invented by [[Ammar Al-Mawsili| Ammar ibn Ali]] of [[Mosul]], which was used for the extraction by suction of soft [[cataracts]], were quite common.

Muslim physicians described such conditions as [[pannus]], [[glaucoma]] (described as ‘headache of the pupil’), [[phlyctenulae]], and operations on the [[conjunctiva]].  They were the first to use the words '[[retina]]' and '[[cataract]]'.

==Education and history==
To become a practitioner, there was no one fixed method or path of training. There was even no formal specialization in the different branches of medicine, as might be expected. But some students did eventually approximate to a specialist by acquiring proficiency in the treatment of certain diseases or in the use of certain drugs.

Nevertheless, it was standard and necessary to learn and understand the works and legacy of predecessors. Among those one can mention, ''The alteration of the eye'' by [[Masawaiyh|Yuhanna ibn Masawayh]], whose work can be considered the earliest work on Ophthalmology, followed by [[Hunain ibn Ishaq]], known in the west as Johannitius, for his work ''The ten treatises of the eye''.  One of Hunain ibn Ishaq's innovations was to describe the crystalline lens as being located in the exact center of the eye.&lt;ref name="Clinical Ophthalmology"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leffler CT, Hadi TM, Udupa A, Schwartz SG, Schwartz D |title=A medieval fallacy: the crystalline lens in the center of the eye |journal=Clinical Ophthalmology |volume=2016 |issue=10 |pages=649–662 |year=2016 |url=https://www.dovepress.com/a-medieval-fallacy-the-crystalline-lens-in-the-center-of-the-eye-peer-reviewed-article-OPTH#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cataract extraction===
The next major landmark text on ophthalmology was the ''Choice of Eye Diseases'' written in [[Egypt]] by the [[Iraq]]i [[Ammar al-Mawsili| Ammar ibn Ali al-Mawsili]][https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_09.html] who attempted the earliest extraction of [[cataract]]s using [[suction]]. He invented a hollow metallic [[syringe]], which he applied through the [[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerotic]] and successfully extracted the cataracts through suction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} He wrote the following on his invention:

{{quote|"Then I constructed the hollow needle, but I did not operate with it on anybody at all, before I came to [[Tiberias]]. There came a man for an operation who told me: Do as you like with me, only I cannot lie on my back. Then I operated on him with the hollow needle and extracted the cataract; and he saw immediately and did not need to lie, but slept as he liked. Only I bandaged his eye for seven days. With this needle nobody preceded me. I have done many operations with it in Egypt."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function|first=Stanley|last=Finger|year=1994|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-514694-8|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other contributions===
[[Avicenna]], in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (c. 1025), described sight as one of the five external [[sense]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function|first=Stanley|last=Finger|year=1994|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-514694-8|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word "[[retina]]" is derived from Avicenna's [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term for the organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function|first=Stanley|last=Finger|year=1994|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-514694-8|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Colliget'', [[Averroes]] (1126–1198) was the first to attribute [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]] properties to the [[retina]],&lt;ref name=Araguz&gt;Martin-Araguz, A.; Bustamante-Martinez, C.; Fernandez-Armayor, Ajo V.; Moreno-Martinez, J. M. (2002). "Neuroscience in al-Andalus and its influence on medieval scholastic medicine", ''Revista de neurología'' '''34''' (9), p. 877-892.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also the first to suggest that the principal organ of [[Visual perception|sight]] might be the [[Arachnoid mater|arachnoid membrane]] (''aranea''). His work led to much discussion in 16th century Europe over whether the principal organ of sight is the traditional [[Galen]]ic crystalline [[Humorism|humour]] or the Averroist ''aranea'', which in turn led to the discovery that the retina is the principal organ of sight.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Theories of Vision from Al-Kindi to Kepler|first=David C.|last=Lindberg|year=1981|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=0-226-48235-9|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn al-Nafis]] wrote a large textbook on ophthalmology called ''The Polished Book on Experimental Ophthalmology''.

==Ottoman Empire==
In the [[Ottoman Empire]], and well into the [[Republic of Turkey]] of the 20th century, a class of ambulatory eye surgeons, popularly known as the ‘kırlangıç oğlanları’ (‘sons of the swallow’) operated on cataract using special knives. From contemporary sources can be glimpsed that the reputation of these “blinding frauds” was far from spotless.&lt;ref&gt;Laban Kaptein (ed.), Ahmed Bican, ''Dürr-i meknûn'', p. 31f.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7088">The '''Pacific Islands Families Study''' is a [[Longitudinal study|long-running]], [[cohort study]] of 1398 children (and their parents) of Pacific Islands origin born in [[Auckland, New Zealand]] during the year 2000.
The cohort of participants was selected from babies born between 15 March 2000 and 17 December 2000 at [[Middlemore Hospital]] with at least one parent identifying as having Pacific Islands origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aut.ac.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/69123/pif_technical_report2002.pdf PIF Technical Report 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/37/2/273 Cohort Profile: The Pacific Islands Families (PIF) Study] ([[International Journal of Epidemiology]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The three overall objectives of the PIF Study are:
# to provide information on Pacific peoples' health, and the cultural, economic, environmental and psychosocial factors that are associated with child health and development outcomes and family functioning,
# to determine how such factors individually and interactively influence positive and negative child, parent and family outcomes over time,
# to provide information that will help set quantifiable targets for Pacific peoples' health.

The study has collected data from mothers, fathers, children and teachers.  Data collection phases have occurred at 6 weeks after birth, 12 months, 24 months, 4 years, 6 years and 9 years.

The study is administered within the Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences at [[Auckland University of Technology]].
Major funding has been provided by the [[Foundation for Research, Science and Technology]] and the [[Health Research Council of New Zealand]].

==Data Collection Phases==

===First Two Years of Life===
At approximately 6 weeks after birth, data were collected from interviews of the ''primary'' caregiver (usually the birth mother) and the ''collateral'' caregiver (the partner of the primary, usually the father).
Data were collected from 1376 families in relation to 1398 children (including 22 pairs of twins).
The ethnic mix of the original cohort was 47% [[Samoans|Samoan]], 21% [[Tongans|Tongan]], 17% [[Cook Islands|Cook Island Maori]], 4% [[Niue]]an and 11% other Pacific or non-Pacific.

At 12 months of age, 1224 primary caregivers and 825 collateral caregivers were interviewed in relation to 1241 children.
At 24 months, 1144 primary caregivers and 854 collateral caregivers were interviewed in relation to 1162 children.

Details of the first two years can be found in a technical report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aut.ac.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/69118/piftechreport.pdf Technical Report 2 - First Two Years of Life]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition to School===
At the age of 4 years, data were collected from primary caregiver interviews and separate child assessments.  At the age of 6 years, data were collected from primary caregiver interviews, collateral caregiver interviews, child assessments and teacher evaluations.

===Towards Adolescence===
As each child turned 9, data were collected from primary caregiver interviews, child assessments and teacher child evaluations. {{as of|2011|June}}, data on 11-year-olds are being collected from primary and collateral caregiver interviews, child assessments and teacher evaluations.

==Key achievements==

===Retention of Participants===
At 6 weeks of age, a total of 1,376 mothers (of 1398 children, including 22 pairs of twins) were interviewed.  Of those, 1224 (89%) participated at 12-months and 1144 (83%) participated at 24-months. No important differential attrition was observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/119-1228/1814/ Pacific Islands Families First Two Years of Life study: design and methodology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624164535/http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/119-1228/1814/ |date=2009-06-24 }} ([[New Zealand Medical Journal]])&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2588">{{Short description|Statistical analyses that were not specified before the data were seen}}
{{Distinguish|Post hoc theorizing}}
In a scientific study, '''post hoc analysis''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[post hoc (disambiguation)|post hoc]]'', "after this") consists of [[statistics|statistical analyses]] that were not specified before the data was seen. This typically creates a [[multiple testing]] problem because each potential analysis is effectively a [[Statistical hypothesis testing|statistical test]]. Multiple testing procedures are sometimes used to compensate, but that is often difficult or impossible to do precisely. ''Post hoc'' analysis that is conducted and interpreted without adequate consideration of this problem is sometimes called ''[[data dredging]]'' by critics, in part because the statistical associations that it finds may be spurious. 

== Causes ==
Sometimes the temptation to engage in ''post hoc'' analysis is motivated by a desire to produce positive results or see a project as successful.  In the case of pharmaceutical research, there may be significant financial consequences to a failed trial, although the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] does not accept ''post hoc'' analysis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/magazine/a-failure-to-heal.html|title=A Failure to Heal|last=Mukherjee|first=Siddhartha|date=2017-11-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In some cases, additional [[subgroup analysis]] may be requested by scientific peers or the editors of academic journals.  In one such incident, journal editors demanded that the statistician [[Richard Peto]] provide a ''post hoc'' analysis of subgroups for the use of aspirin as [[secondary prevention]] for people who had experienced heart attacks.  He refused the request as being statistically unsound and likely to lead to nonsensical results.  When they persisted, he provided the editors with a subgroup analysis that evaluated the supposed response based upon the patients' [[Astrological sign|astrological signs]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Peto]], "Current misconception 3: that subgroup-specific trial mortality results often provide a good basis for individualising patient care", ''[[Br J Cancer]]'', 104(7), pages 1057-1058 (2011). {{doi|10.1038/bjc.2011.79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] has traditionally classified death according to the primary type of [[disease]] or [[injury]]. However, [[causes of death]] may also be classified in terms of preventable risk factors—such as smoking, unhealthy diet, sexual behavior, and reckless driving—which contribute to a number of different diseases. Such risk factors are usually not recorded directly on death certificates, although they are acknowledged in medical reports.

==Worldwide==
It is estimated that of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes because they have aged.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt; In industrialized nations the proportion is much higher, reaching 90 percent.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = August 7, 2011| citeseerx = 10.1.1.395.745 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, albeit indirectly, [[biological aging]] (senescence) is by far the leading cause of death. Whether senescence as a biological process itself can be slowed down, halted, or even reversed is a subject of current scientific speculation and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sens.org/ |title=SENS Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, on average 29,000 children died of preventable causes each day (that is, about 20 deaths per minute). The authors provide the context:

The '''prism fusion range''' ('''PFR''') or '''fusional vergence amplitude''' is a clinical eye test performed by orthoptists, optometrists, and [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologists]] to assess motor fusion, specifically the extent to which a patient can maintain [[binocular single vision]] ([[Binocular vision|BSV]]) in the presence of increasing [[vergence]] demands. Motor fusion is largely accounted to amplitudes of fusional vergences and relative fusional vergences. Fusional vergence is the maximum vergence movement enabling BSV and the limit is at the point of [[diplopia]] (double vision). Relative fusional vergence is the maximum vergence movement enabling a patient to see a comfortable clear image and the limit is represented by the first point of blur.&lt;ref name="Agarwal,"&gt;Agarwal, A., Agarwal, A., Agarwal, S.,  Alio, J.L., Apple, D.J., Burrato, L. &amp; Pandey, S.K. (2002). Textbook of Ophthalmology: Basic Sciences, Optics and Refraction, Neuro-ophthalmology, Strabismus (1st ed.). Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; These motor fusion functions should fall within average values so that BSV can be comfortably achieved. Excessive stress on the [[vergence]] system or inability to converge or diverge adequately can lead to [[Asthenopia|asthenopic symptoms]], which generally result from decompensation of latent deviations ([[heterophoria]]) or loss of control of ocular misalignments.&lt;ref name="American"/&gt; Motor anomalies can be managed in various ways, however, in order to commence treatment, motor fusion testing such as the PFR is required. 
[[File:Prism bar and fixation stick.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Equipment required to perform a Prism Fusion Range Test. From left to right: an accommodative fixation stick, a vertical prism bar, and a horizontal prism bar.]]
The PFR involves placing a [[prism]] bar in front of an eye. In a patient with BSV, a natural shift of the eye occurs. When measuring horizontal fusion ranges, base in prisms assess fusional divergence while base out prisms assess fusional convergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Pediatric Strabismus and Amblyopia|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=huI8NTevArkC|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2006-04-19|isbn = 9780387279244|first = Kenneth W.|last = Wright|first2 = Peter H.|last2 = Spiegel|first3 = Lisa|last3 = Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vertical fusional vergence amplitude can also be measured with base up and base down prisms although the horizontal PFR is typically the main focus when testing. When performing the PFR, prism strengths are increased, placing greater demand on the [[vergence]] system, eventually resulting in a break point accompanying [[diplopia]].&lt;ref name="Codina,"&gt;Codina, C.J. &amp; Ludden, S. M. (2013). Is there an ideal speed for the prism fusion range?. The British and Irish Orthoptic Journal, 10, 51-55. Retrieved from www.bioj.org/index.php/bioj/article/download/103/83&lt;/ref&gt; Break point, recovery and blur are key aspects of this assessment. The break point occurs at the loss of BSV, recovery point when BSV is regained from break and blur point is at the loss of comfortable BSV. These stops can be subjectively indicated when the patient notices a double or blurred image. Both subjective and objective measurements can be considered however the examiner’s objective observation is the gold standard.

== Indications of use ==
This test is designed to assess the following:
* the limits of a patient’s BSV
* strength of binocular functions (control) of a [[heterophoria]] to determine if it is decompensating&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* fusional convergence with a base out prism
* fusional divergence with a base in prism
* vertical amplitude with base up and base down prisms
* positive and negative relative fusional convergence by asking patient to report when blur is appreciated
* progress of a patient undergoing management for ocular misalignments&lt;ref name="Ansons,"/&gt;

== Methods of assessment ==
The PFR is performed in bright lighting conditions at near (33&amp;nbsp;cm) or far (6m), using [[prism]] bars (horizontal and vertical) and an accommodative fixation target such as a letter on a fixation stick for near, or a [[Snellen chart|Snellen Chart]] letter for distance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.optometry.co.uk/uploads/articles/cetarticle_2611.pdf|title = Investigative techniques in binocular vision.|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Weddell|first = L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patient should wear their refractive correction for the distance being tested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The following method relates to assessment of the horizontal PFR.
# The patient, able to appreciate BSV, is asked to fixate on the accommodative target for the entirety of the assessment and to indicate when the target first becomes doubled.
# The examiner places the [[prism]] bar in front of one of the patient’s eyes with the prism placed “base in” to assess the fusional divergence amplitude. The divergence amplitude should be measured before convergence, as measuring the convergence amplitude first could contaminate the results of the divergence amplitude since convergence movements induce significant [[vergence]] adaptation.&lt;ref name="Howard,"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Howard, I. P. (Ed.). (2012). Perceiving in Depth, Volume 1: Basic Mechanisms. [Oxford University Press]. Retrieved from https://books.google.com.au/books?id=TCmuuVc54jwC&amp;pg=PA507&amp;lpg=PA507&amp;dq=fusional+divergence+before+convergence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PqK67ELqOZ&amp;sig=uGZ6-OLcYprn1hjOFzMYpqpwegY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBWoVChMI3oHEtKH-xwIVih2UCh1LuwAh#v=onepage&amp;q=fusional%20divergence%20before%20convergence&amp;f=false &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Starting with the [[prism]] of the smallest power, the examiner increases the prismatic power slowly, allowing a fusion response for each [[prism]], until the patient can no longer fuse and reports [[diplopia]]. The prism power value at which [[diplopia]] was appreciated is recorded as the break point. From the break point, the examiner slowly reduces the prismatic power until the patient regains BSV. The [[prism]] value at which the patient’s BSV is first restored is recorded as the recovery point.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
# The above steps are repeated for the same eye, but with the [[prism]] bar placed with its base out to assess fusional convergence.&lt;ref name="Ansons,"&gt;Diagnosis and Management of Ocular Motility Disorders [John Wiley &amp; Sons]. Retrieved from http://reader.eblib.com.au.ez.library.latrobe.edu.au/(S(xqbcohzqur2arh512r1n55kr))/Reader.aspx?p=1527854&amp;o=155&amp;u=XfNeubn2d7CBZKqnbMXY9g%3d%3d&amp;t=1442499641&amp;h=F78AFAD18023BB379B95676070F3C06B9EA28BA2&amp;s=21338196&amp;ut=492&amp;pg=1&amp;r=img&amp;c=-1&amp;pat=n&amp;cms=-1&amp;sd=1#&lt;/ref&gt;

The results from this method of assessment rely on the patient’s responses, and are therefore subjective. The assessment should also be performed objectively, in which the examiner observes the eye’s movement behind the [[prism]], anticipating the break point at which the eye can no longer make a [[vergence]] movement to maintain BSV.&lt;ref name="Ansons,"/&gt;

== Recording and interpreting outcomes ==
When recording the results obtained from the PFR, it is important to include the following in order:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Clinical Ophthalmology|last = Kanski, Bowling, Nischal, &amp; Pearson|first = J., B., K., &amp; A.|publisher = Elsevier/Saunders|year = 2011|isbn = 9780702055720|location = Edinburgh|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* name of the test performed; i.e.“PFR”
* with optical correction “cc” or without correction “sc”
* distance the test was performed at i.e. far “(6m)” or near “(1/3m)”
* [[prism]] power at which the patient ‘breaks’ and ‘recovers’ i.e. the [[prism]] power number followed by its measuring unit symbol “Δ”
** Note: Some examiners may choose not to assess and/or record ‘recovery’. If recovery is being recorded, separate the ‘break’ and accompanying ‘recovery’ results with a forward slash i.e. “/”.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;
* relevant position of the [[prism]] in front of the eye denoted by: base in “BI” or “-” for fusional divergence; base out “BO” or “+” for fusional convergence; base up “BU” or base down “BD” for vertical fusional vergence.
* what the patient sees when they ‘break’; i.e. “c [[diplopia]]” or “c [[Suppression (eye)|suppression]]”

There are two ways to record the PFR results, the first being the fusion range (break without recovery) and the other including break and recovery. Follow the examples below for guidance:

'''Fusion range''':
* PFR cc (6m) 8Δ BI → 20Δ BO 
* PFR sc  (1/3m) 16Δ BI → 45Δ BO c diplopia
'''Break + recovery:'''
* PFR sc (6m) -8/6Δ → +20/15Δ c diplopia 
* PFR cc (1/3m) -16/14Δ → +45/40Δ c diplopia
Patient results should be compared to the normal values for prism fusional amplitudes to determine if the patient has any anomalies.&lt;ref name="Ansons,"/&gt; Recovery should ideally be within 5Δ of break point.
* Near (1/3m): 15Δ BI → 35-40Δ BO
* Distance (6m): 5-7Δ BI → 15Δ BO
* Vertical: 3Δ BU → 3Δ BD
If patient results do not reflect the normal values, they may have the following issues:
* [[Convergence insufficiency]] - usually associated with [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodative]] difficulties, the fusional convergence range of these patients is reduced.
* Divergence insufficiency- although rare and usually associated with a neurological condition, the PFR is able to detect a reduced divergence range. 
* Divergence excess - when divergence occurs in excess, therefore the eyes demonstrate a reduced ability to converge. Usually occurs with an exo-deviation.&lt;ref name="American"&gt;Care of the Patient with Accommodative and Vergence Dysfunction. Retrieved from https://www.aoa.org/documents/CPG-18.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

===Advantages===
* measures binocular functions and control of deviation simultaneously.
* Minimal equipment required.
* measures horizontal and vertical fusion ranges.
* Can provide subjective and objective measurements.
* Can be performed on patients with [[Retinal correspondence|abnormal retinal correspondence]].
* Determines the [[Orthoptics|orthoptic]] exercises required to manage fusional inadequacies i.e. [[convergence insufficiency]].

===Disadvantages===
* Can not measure [[Cyclotropia|cyclotorsion]].
* Can not be performed on patients with [[Suppression (eye)|suppression]] as patients can not appreciate [[diplopia]].
* Convergence must be measured second to divergence or results will be contaminated.
* Can only be performed on patients with [[Binocular vision|BSV]] to start with.
* Objective measurements rely on examiner expertise and may be difficult for beginners to observe. 
* Subjective measurements require patient cooperation to attain reliable results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5322">'''Street dentistry''' is the unlicensed practice of dentistry in the street, usually for people who are unable to afford licensed dental care.

==History==

[[Image:Johann Liss 002.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A depiction of an early 17th-century dentist practicing outdoors by Johann Liss.]]

Before the 20th century, dentistry was largely unregulated. In [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]], it was often practiced by monks, who were the most educated of the period. Barbers and blacksmiths, too, performed dental services. One of the first attempts to regulate the practice of dentistry came in France in 1400, when royal decrees prohibited barbers not in the [[Guild of Barbers]] from performing surgical procedures except for bleeding, cupping, leeching, and extracting teeth.

In the United States in 1840, [[Horace H. Hayden]] and [[Chapin Harris]] established the world's first school of dentistry, the [[Baltimore College of Dental Surgery]], and created the [[Doctor of Dental Surgery]] (DDS) degree. In the same year, the world’s first national dental organization, the [[American Society of Dental Surgeons]], was founded. In 1841, Alabama instituted the first dental practice act, regulating the practice of dentistry in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/public/resources/history/index.asp|title=History of Dentistry|publisher=American Dental Association|accessdate=2009-02-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125141031/http://www.ada.org/public/resources/history/timeline_19cent.asp|archivedate=2007-01-25|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York around the turn of the century, street dentists like [[Painless Parker|Edgar R.R. "Painless" Parker]] flourished. Despite dentistry becoming regulated, unlicensed dentists still practiced, often offering inferior services, prompting some to call for their prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1909/09/26/archives/the-unlicensed-dentists.html|title=The Unlicensed Dentists|date=Sep 26, 1909|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As many as 5000 unlicensed dentists may have practiced in New York in the early 1900s. In 1900, 283 complaints were received by the Law Committee of the New York State Dental Society. Some patients died from infections and abscesses resulting from lack of sanitation. Others died from improper administration of anaesthetic. According to a newspaper report in 1910, many of these dentists were immigrants whose home countries did not regulate dentistry as stringently as did the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1910/09/18/archives/crusading-against-the-citys-unethical-dentists-the-day-of-the.html|title=CRUSADING AGAINST THE CITY'S "UNETHICAL" DENTISTS; The Day of the Bargain Dental Parlor Where Patients Were Maltreated and Fleeced Is Passing.|date=September 18, 1910|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern street dentistry==

[[Image:Street dentist in Bangalore.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A street dentist in [[Bangalore]].]]

In [[India]], street services are plentiful, with dentists operating alongside other street services, such as apothecaries, repairmen, and barbers. These practitioners charge far less than licensed dentists, often charging as little as 125 rupees for a procedure such as a [[Bridge (dentistry)|bridge]]—which, at a licensed dentist, could be as expensive as 10,000 rupees. Many learn the trade from their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/07/health/07case.html|title=India's Street Dentists Are a Vanishing Breed|last=Stowe|first=Stacy|date=June 7, 2005|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Street dentistry is not confined to India. In [[Paris, France|Paris]] in 2003, 23 unlicensed dentists who practiced out of cafes and grocery stores were arrested. The dentists involved were [[Syria]]n immigrants who provided dental services mostly for other immigrants who did not have [[health insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/11/world/world-briefing-europe-france-back-street-fillings.html|title=France: Back-Street Fillings |date=Sep 11, 2003|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, a man was arrested in [[Van Nuys, California]] for operating an unlicensed dental practice out of the back of a toy store in a strip mall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/11/local/me-41536|title=Man Accused of Illegal Practice of Dentistry at Van Nuys Store|last=Moore|first=Solomon|date=Nov 11, 1998|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

In India, Chapter V, Section 49 of the Dentist Act of 1948 requires dentists, dental mechanics, and dental hygienists to be licensed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dciindia.org/dentistact_1948_pages/dentistact_1948.html?indexposition=1|title=DENTIST Act, 1948|publisher=Dental Council of India|accessdate=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; making street dentistry illegal, though street dentists continue to practice. Most countries in the developed world have laws preventing the unlicensed practice of dentistry (see [[Dentistry throughout the world]]).

'''Strength training''' is a type of [[physical exercise]] specializing in the use of resistance to induce [[muscular contraction]] which builds the [[physical strength|strength]], [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic endurance]], and [[Muscle hypertrophy|size]] of [[skeletal muscle]]s.

When properly performed, strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well-being, including increased [[bone]], muscle, [[tendon]], and [[ligament]] strength and toughness, improved [[joint]] function, reduced potential for injury,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shaw| first = I. |author2=Shaw, B.S. | year = 2014| title = Resistance Training and the Prevention of Sports Injuries.

Training commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output of the muscle through incremental weight increases and uses a variety of exercises and types of [[:Category:Weight training equipment|equipment]] to target specific muscle groups. Strength training is primarily an [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] activity, although some proponents have adapted it to provide the benefits of [[aerobic exercise]] through [[circuit training]].

Strength training is typically associated with the production of lactate, which is a limiting factor of exercise performance. Regular endurance exercise leads to adaptations in skeletal muscle which can prevent lactate levels from rising during strength training. This is mediated via activation of PGC-1alpha which alter the LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) isoenzyme complex composition and decreases the activity of the lactate generating enzyme LDHA, while increasing the activity of the lactate metabolizing enzyme LDHB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Summermatter|first=Serge|last2=Santos|first2=Gesa|last3=Pérez-Schindler|first3=Joaquín|last4=Handschin|first4=Christoph|date=2013-05-21|title=Skeletal muscle PGC-1α controls whole-body lactate homeostasis through estrogen-related receptor α-dependent activation of LDH B and repression of LDH A|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=110|issue=21|pages=8738–43|doi=10.1073/pnas.1212976110|issn=1091-6490|pmc=3666691|pmid=23650363|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.8738S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports where strength training is central are [[bodybuilding]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[powerlifting]], [[strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]], [[Highland games]], [[shot put]], [[discus throw]], and [[javelin throw]]. Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen, notably [[tennis]], [[American football]], [[wrestling]], [[track and field]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[lacrosse]], [[basketball]], [[pole dancing]], [[hockey]], [[professional wrestling]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], and [[soccer]]. Strength training for other sports and physical activities is becoming increasingly popular.

The benefits of weight training include greater muscular strength, improved muscle tone and appearance, increased endurance and enhanced bone density.

=== Increased physical attractiveness ===
Many people take up weight training to improve their [[physical attractiveness]]. There is evidence that a body type consisting of broad shoulders and a narrow waist, attainable through strength training, is the most physically attractive male attribute according to women participating in the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mautz|first=Brian S.|last2=Wong|first2=Bob B. M.|last3=Peters|first3=Richard A.|last4=Jennions|first4=Michael D.|date=2013-04-23|title=Penis size interacts with body shape and height to influence male attractiveness|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/17/6925|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=110|issue=17|pages=6925–30|doi=10.1073/pnas.1219361110|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3637716|pmid=23569234|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.6925M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most men can develop substantial muscles; most women lack the [[testosterone]] to do it, but they can develop a firm, "toned" (see below) physique, and they can increase their strength by the same proportion as that achieved by men (but usually from a significantly lower starting point). An individual's [[Genetics|genetic]] make-up dictates the response to weight training stimuli to a significant extent.  Training can not exceed a muscle's intrinsic genetically determined qualities though polymorphic expression does occur e.g., Myosin heavy chains&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Applications|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Metabolic Monitoring for Military Field|date=2004-01-01|title=Physiological Biomarkers for Predicting Performance|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215705/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies also show that people are able to tell the strength of men based on photos of their bodies and faces, and that physical appearance indicates cues of strengths that are often linked to a man's physical formidability and, therefore, his attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sell|first=Aaron|last2=Cosmides|first2=Leda|last3=Tooby|first3=John|last4=Sznycer|first4=Daniel|last5=Rueden|first5=Christopher von|last6=Gurven|first6=Michael|date=2009-02-07|title=Human adaptations for the visual assessment of strength and fighting ability from the body and face|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1656/575|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=276|issue=1656|pages=575–584|doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.1177|issn=0962-8452|pmid=18945661}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is aligned with studies that reveal those who undergo strength training attain more [[self-esteem]] and [[body cathexis]] when compared to individuals who do not undergo training or exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles and Practice of Resistance Training|last=Stone|first=Michael|last2=Stone|first2=Meg|last3=Sands|first3=William|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2007|isbn=9780880117067|location=Champaign, Illinois|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, people who undergo strength training tend to have a more favorable [[body image]] even than those who also engage in regular [[Exercise|physical activities]] such as [[walking]] and [[running]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Body Image Workbook: An Eight-Step Program for Learning to Like Your Looks|last=Cash|first=Thomas|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|year=2008|isbn=9781608826179|location=Oakland, CA|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; More women are also increasingly revealed to be dissatisfied with their body today than those surveyed in 1984 and they often turn to exercise such as strength training to improve their [[body shape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tighten Your Tummy in 2 Weeks: Lose up to 14 Inches &amp; 14 Pounds of Fat in 14 Days!|last=Darden|first=Ellington|publisher=Rodale|year=2015|isbn=9781623365714|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workouts elevate [[metabolism]] for up to 14 hours following 45-minutes of vigorous exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Shanely|first2=R.

=== Increased general physical health ===
Strength training also provides functional benefits. Stronger muscles improve posture, provide better support for [[joint]]s, and reduce the risk of [[injury]] from everyday activities. [[Old age|Older]] people who take up weight training can prevent some of the loss of muscle tissue that normally accompanies [[aging]]—and even regain some functional strength—and by doing so become less frail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Gordon|first2=P. M.|year=2011|title=Resistance Exercise for the Aging Adult: Clinical Implications and Prescription Guidelines|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|volume=124|issue=3|pages=194–98|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2010.08.020|pmid=21396499|last1=Peterson|first1=M. D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be able to avoid some types of [[physical disability]]. Weight-bearing exercise also helps to prevent [[osteoporosis]] and to improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis.&lt;ref name="pmid21360219"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bergmann|last3=Boonen|last4=Boutsen|last5=Bruyere|last6=Devogelaer|last7=Goemaere|last8=Hollevoet|last9=Kaufman|year=2011|title=Non-pharmacological management of osteoporosis: a consensus of the Belgian Bone Club|journal=Osteoporos Int|volume=22|issue=11|pages=2769–88|doi=10.1007/s00198-011-1545-x|pmc=3186889|pmid=21360219|author=Body JJ, Bergmann P, Boonen S, Boutsen Y, Bruyere O, Devogelaer JP, Goemaere S, Hollevoet N, Kaufman JM, Milisen K, Rozenberg S, Reginster JY|last10=Milisen|last11=Rozenberg|last12=Reginster}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of weight training for older people have been confirmed by studies of people who began engaging in it even in their 80s and 90s.

Though strength training can stimulate the [[cardiovascular system]], many exercise [[physiologist]]s, based on their observation of maximal [[oxygen]] uptake, argue that [[aerobics]] training is a better cardiovascular stimulus. Central [[catheter]] monitoring during resistance training reveals increased [[cardiac output]], suggesting that strength training shows potential for [[cardiovascular exercise]]. However, a 2007 meta-analysis found that, though aerobic training is an effective therapy for heart failure patients, combined aerobic and strength training is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Liang|last3=Pechter|last4=Jones|last5=McAlister|last6=Clark|date=2007-06-19|title=A meta-analysis of the effect of exercise training on left ventricular remodeling in heart failure patients: the benefit depends on the type of training performed|journal=J Am Coll Cardiol|volume=49|issue=24|pages=2329–36|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2007.02.055|pmid=17572248|author=Haykowsky MJ, Liang Y, Pechter D, Jones LW, McAlister FA, Clark AM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength training may be important to metabolic and cardiovascular health. Recent evidence suggests that resistance training may reduce metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk. Overweight individuals with high strength fitness exhibit metabolic/cardiovascular risk profiles similar to normal-weight, fit individuals rather than overweight unfit individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Lee|first2=M. M.|last3=Katiraie|first3=M|last4=Krell|first4=S. L.|last5=Angadi|first5=S. S.|last6=Chronley|first6=M. K.|last7=Oh|first7=C. S.|last8=Ribas|first8=V|last9=Harris|first9=R.

K.|last10=Hevener|first10=A. L.|last11=Croymans|first11=D. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For rehabilitation or to address an impairment ===
For many people in [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]] or with an acquired [[disability]], such as following stroke or orthopaedic surgery, strength training for weak muscles is a key factor to optimise recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Dorsch|first2=S.|last3=Canning|first3=C. G.|year=2006|title=Strengthening interventions increase strength and improve activity after stroke: A systematic review|journal=Australian Journal of Physiotherapy|volume=52|issue=4|pages=241–48|doi=10.1016/S0004-9514(06)70003-4|pmid=17132118|last1=Ada|first1=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For people with such a health condition, their strength training is likely to need to be designed by an appropriate health professional, such as a [[physiotherapist]] or an [[occupational therapist]].

=== Increased sports performance ===
Stronger muscles improve performance in a variety of sports. Sport-specific training routines are used by many competitors. These often specify that the speed of [[muscle contraction]] during weight training should be the same as that of the particular sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Phillips N | year = 1997 | title = Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning | url = | journal = Physiotherapy | volume = 83 | issue = 1| page = 47 | doi = 10.1016/s0031-9406(05)66120-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For the pleasure of the activity ===
One side effect of intense exercise is increased levels of [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], and [[norepinephrine]], which can help to improve mood and counter feelings of [[depression (mood)|depression]] (It should be noted that dopamine and serotonin were not found to be increased by resistance training).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 2001|title=Effects of physical exercise on anxiety, depression, and sensitivity to stress|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=21|issue=1|pages=33–61|doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(99)00032-X|pmid=11148895|last1=Salmon|first1=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exercise and Depression|url=http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/exercise-depression|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as [[myokine]]s which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comprehensive Physiology|year=2013|isbn=9780470650714|volume=3|pages=1337–62|chapter=Muscle as a Secretory Organ|doi=10.1002/cphy.c120033|pmid=23897689|issue=3|author1=Pedersen|first1=B. K.|journal=Comprehensive Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==
The basic principles of strength training involve a manipulation of the number of repetitions (reps), sets, tempo, exercises and force to cause desired changes in strength, endurance or size  by overloading of a group of muscles. The specific combinations of reps, sets, exercises, resistance and force depend on the purpose of the individual performing the exercise: to gain size and strength multiple (4+) sets with fewer reps must be performed using more force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Kargarfard|first2=M.|last3=Danaee|first3=M.|last4=Bahri Mohd Tamrin|first4=S.|year=2015|title=Intensive Resistance Exercise and Circadian Salivary Testosterone Concentrations Among Young Male Recreational Lifters|journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research|volume=29|issue=1|pages=151–58|doi=10.1519/JSC.0000000000000632|pmid=25051005|last1=Shariat|first1=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A wide spectrum of regimens can be adopted to achieve different results, but the classic formula recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine reads as follows:
* 8 to 12 repetitions of a resistance training exercise for each major muscle group at an intensity of 40% to 80% of a one-repetition max (RM) depending on the training level of the participant.
* Two to three minutes of rest is recommended between exercise sets to allow for proper recovery.
* Two to four sets are recommended for each muscle group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 2013|title=High-Intensity Circuit Training Using Body Weight: Maximum Results With Minimal Investment|journal=ACSM's Health &amp; Fitness Journal|volume=17|issue=3|pages=8–13|doi=10.1249/fit.0b013e31828cb1e8|author=Klika, Brett|author2=Jordan, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically failure to use good form during a training set can result in injury or an inability to meet training goals – since the desired muscle group is not challenged sufficiently, the threshold of [[#Progressive overload|overload]] is never reached and the muscle does not gain in strength. There are cases when cheating is beneficial, as is the case where weaker groups become the weak link in the chain and the target muscles are never fully exercised as a result.

=== Terminology ===
Strength training has a variety of specialized terms used to describe parameters of strength training:
* [[Physical exercise|Exercise]] – different movements which involve rotating joints in specific patterns to challenge muscles in different ways.
* [[Form (exercise)|Form]] – each exercise has a specific form, a topography of movement designed to maximize safety and muscle strength gains.
* Rep – short for repetition, a rep is a single cycle of lifting and lowering a weight in a controlled manner, moving through the form of the exercise.
* [[Weight training|Set]] – a set consists of several repetitions performed one after another with no break between them with the number of reps per set and sets per exercise depending on the goal of the individual. The number of repetitions one can perform at a certain weight is called the Rep Maximum (RM). For example, if one could perform ten reps at 75&amp;nbsp;lbs, then their RM for that weight would be 10RM. [[1RM]] is therefore the maximum weight that someone can lift in a given exercise – i.e. a weight that they can only lift once without a break.
* [[Tempo]] – the speed with which an exercise is performed; the tempo of a movement has implications for the weight that can be moved and the effects on the muscle.

=== Realization of training goals ===
For developing endurance, gradual increases in volume and gradual decreases in intensity is the most effective program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1519/1533-4287(2003)017&lt;0082:ACOLAD&gt;2.0.CO;2| title = A Comparison of Linear and Daily Undulating Periodized Programs with Equated Volume and Intensity for Local Muscular Endurance| journal = The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research| volume = 17| pages = 82| year = 2003| last1 = Rhea | first1 = M.

Beginning weight-trainers are in the process of training the neurological aspects of strength, the ability of the brain to generate a rate of [[neuron]]al [[action potential]]s that will produce a muscular contraction that is close to the maximum of the muscle's potential.

Weights for each exercise should be chosen so that the desired number of repetitions can just be achieved.

=== Progressive overload ===
In one common method, weight training uses the principle of progressive overload, in which the [[muscle]]s are overloaded by attempting to lift at least as much weight as they are capable. They respond by growing larger and stronger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brooks | first = G.A. | author2 = Fahey, T.D. &amp; White, T.P. | year =1996 | title = Exercise Physiology:  Human Bioenergetics and Its Applications | publisher = Mayfield Publishing Co | isbn = 0-07-255642-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure is repeated with progressively heavier weights as the practitioner gains strength and endurance.

However, performing exercises at the absolute limit of one's strength (known as [[One rep maximum|one rep max]] lifts) is considered too risky for all but the most experienced practitioners. Moreover, most individuals wish to develop a combination of strength, endurance and muscle size. One repetition sets are not well suited to these aims. Practitioners therefore lift lighter (sub-maximal) weights, with more repetitions, to fatigue the muscle and all fibres within that muscle as required by the progressive overload principle.

Commonly, each exercise is continued to the point of momentary muscular failure. Contrary to widespread belief, this is not the point at which the individual thinks they cannot complete any more repetitions, but rather the first repetition that fails due to inadequate muscular strength. [[Training to failure]] is a controversial topic with some advocating training to failure on all sets while others believe that this will lead to [[overtraining]], and suggest training to failure only on the last set of an exercise.&lt;ref name="Stoppani"&gt;Stoppani, Jim (October 2004). [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-980825861.html Fail – to be strong.] ''Joe Weider's Muscle &amp; Fitness''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners recommend finishing a set of repetitions just before reaching a personal maximum at a given time. Adrenaline and other hormones may promote additional intensity by stimulating the body to lift additional weight (as well as the neuro-muscular stimulations that happen when in "fight-or-flight" mode, as the body activates more muscle fibres), so getting "psyched up" before a workout can increase the maximum weight lifted.

Weight training can be a very effective form of strength training because exercises can be chosen, and weights precisely adjusted, to safely exhaust each individual muscle group after the specific numbers of sets and repetitions that have been found to be the most effective for the individual. Other strength training exercises lack the flexibility and precision that weights offer.

=== Split training ===
Split training involves working no more than three muscle groups or body parts per day, instead spreading the training of specific body parts throughout a training cycle of several days. It is commonly used by more advanced practitioners due to the logistics involved in training all muscle groups maximally. Training all the muscles in the body individually through their full range of motion in a single day is generally not considered possible due to caloric and time constraints. Split training involves fully exhausting individual muscle groups during a workout, then allowing several days for the muscle to fully recover. Muscles are worked roughly twice per week and allowed roughly 72 hours to recover. Recovery of certain muscle groups is usually achieved on days while training other groups, i.e. a 7-day week can consist of a practitioner training trapezius, side shoulders and upper shoulders to exhaustion on one day, the following day the arms to exhaustion, the day after that the rear, front shoulders and back, the day after that the chest. In this way all mentioned muscle groups are allowed the necessary recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kraemer, William J. |author2=Zatsiorsky, Vladimir M. |title=Science and Practice of Strength Training, Second Edition |publisher=Human Kinetics Publishers |location=Champaign, Ill |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWSn4iKgNo8C&amp;pg=PP12&amp;dq=strength+training+weekly |isbn=0-7360-5628-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page= 161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intensity, volume, and frequency ===
Three important variables of strength training are intensity, volume, and frequency. Intensity refers to the amount of [[mechanical work|work]] required to achieve the activity and is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[mass]] of the weights being lifted. Volume refers to the number of muscles worked, exercises, sets, and reps during a single session.  Frequency refers to how many training sessions are performed per week.

These variables are important because they are all mutually conflicting, as the muscle only has so much strength and endurance, and takes time to recover due to [[microtrauma]]. Increasing one by any significant amount necessitates the decrease of the other two, e.g. increasing weight means a reduction of reps, and will require more recovery time and therefore fewer workouts per week. Trying to push too much intensity, volume and frequency will result in [[overtraining]], and eventually lead to injury and other health issues such as chronic soreness and general [[lethargy]], illness or even acute trauma such as [[avulsion fracture]]s. A high-medium-low formula can be used to avoid overtraining, with either intensity, volume, or frequency being high, one of the others being medium, and the other being low. One example of this training strategy can be found in the following chart:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type!!High!!Med!!Low
|-
| Intensity (% of [[One rep maximum|1RM]])||80–100%||40–70%||0–40%
|-
| Volume (per muscle)||1 exercise||2 exercises||3+ exercises
|-
| Sets||1 set||2–3 sets||4+ sets
|-
| Reps||1–6 reps||8–15 reps||20+ reps
|-
| Session frequency||1 p/w||2–3 p/w||4+ p/w
|}

A common training strategy is to set the volume and frequency the same each week (e.g. training 3 times per week, with 2 sets of 12 reps each workout), and steadily increase the intensity (weight) on a weekly basis. However, to maximize progress to specific goals, individual programs may require different manipulations, such as decreasing the weight, and increase volume or frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Luecke|first2=T.|last3=Wendeln|first3=H.|last4=Toma|first4=K.|last5=Hagerman|first5=F.|last6=Murray|first6=T.|last7=Ragg|first7=K.|last8=Ratamess|first8=N.|last9=Kraemer|first9=W.|year=2002|title=Muscular adaptations in response to three different resistance-training regimens: Specificity of repetition maximum training zones|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=88|issue=1–2|pages=50–60|doi=10.1007/s00421-002-0681-6|pmid=12436270|last1=Campos|first1=G.|last10=Staron|first10=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making program alterations on a daily basis (daily undulating periodization) seems to be more efficient in eliciting strength gains than doing so every 4 weeks (linear periodization),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2002|title=A comparison of linear and daily undulating periodized programs with equated volume and intensity for strength|journal=J Strength Cond Res|volume=16|issue=2|pages=250–55|doi=10.1519/1533-4287(2002)016&lt;0250:ACOLAD&gt;2.0.CO;2|pmid=11991778|author=Rhea MR|author2=Ball SD|author3=Phillips WT|author4=Burkett LN}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for beginners there are no differences between different periodization models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=A comparison of periodization models during nine weeks with equated volume and intensity for strength|journal=J Strength Cond Res|volume=21|issue=4|pages=1245–50|doi=10.1519/R-20446.1|pmid=18076234|author=Buford TW|author2=Rossi SJ|author3=Smith DB|author4=Warren AJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Periodization ===
There are many complicated definitions for periodization, but the term simply means the division of the overall training program into periods which accomplish different goals.

Periodization is the modulating of volume, intensity, and frequency over time, to both stimulate gains and allow recovery.

In some programs for example; volume is decreased during a training cycle while intensity is increased. In this template, a lifter would begin a training cycle with a higher rep range than he will finish with.

For this example, the lifter has a 1 rep max of 225&amp;nbsp;lb:

{| class="wikitable"

|}

This is an example of periodization where the number of repetitions decreases while the weight increases.

== Practice of weight training ==

=== Methods and equipment ===
{{See also|Weight training#Types of exercises|l1=Weight training: Types of exercises}}
There are many methods of strength training. Examples include [[weight training]], [[circuit training]], [[isometric exercise]], [[gymnastics]], [[plyometrics]], [[Parkour]], [[yoga]], [[Pilates]], [[Super Slow]].

Strength training may be done with minimal or no equipment, for instance [[bodyweight exercise]]s. [[Exercise equipment|Equipment]] used for strength training includes [[barbells]] and [[dumbbells]], [[weight machine]]s and other [[exercise machine]]s, [[weighted clothing]], [[resistance band]]s, [[:Category:gymnastics apparatus|gymnastics apparatus]], [[Swiss ball]]s, [[wobble board (exercise)|wobble boards]], [[indian club]]s, [[pneumatic exercise equipment]], [[hydraulic exercise equipment]].

=== Aerobic exercise versus anaerobic exercise ===
Strength training exercise is primarily [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]].&lt;ref name="kraemer"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2003|title=Strength training basics: Designing workouts to meet patients' goals|journal=The Physician and Sportsmedicine|volume=31|issue=8|pages=39–45|doi=10.3810/psm.2003.08.457|pmid=20086485|author1=Kraemer|first1=W. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even while training at a lower intensity (training loads of ~20-RM), anaerobic glycolysis is still the major source of power, although [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] metabolism makes a small contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2003|title=What is exercise? A primer for practitioners|journal=The Physician and Sportsmedicine|volume=31|issue=3|pages=31–49|doi=10.3810/psm.2003.03.247|doi-broken-date=2018-05-05|pmid=20086460|author1=Knuttgen|first1=H. G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weight training is commonly perceived as anaerobic exercise, because one of the more common goals is to increase strength by lifting heavy weights. Other goals such as rehabilitation, weight loss, body shaping, and bodybuilding often use lower weights, adding aerobic character to the exercise.

Except in the extremes, a muscle will fire fibres of both the aerobic or anaerobic types on any given exercise, in varying ratio depending on the load on the intensity of the contraction.&lt;ref name=Kraemer /&gt; This is known as the energy system continuum. At higher loads, the muscle will recruit all muscle fibres possible, both anaerobic ("fast-twitch") and aerobic ("slow-twitch"), in order to generate the most force. However, at maximum load, the anaerobic processes contract so forcefully that the aerobic fibers are completely shut out, and all work is done by the anaerobic processes. Because the anaerobic muscle fibre uses its fuel faster than the blood and intracellular restorative cycles can resupply it, the maximum number of repetitions is limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/18/07/06.html "Muscle Metabolism: Aerobic vs. Anaerobic"]. chiroweb.com.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aerobic regime, the blood and intracellular processes can maintain a supply of fuel and oxygen, and continual repetition of the motion will not cause the muscle to fail.

[[Circuit weight training]] is a form of exercise that uses a number of weight training exercise sets separated by short intervals. The cardiovascular effort to recover from each set serves a function similar to an aerobic exercise, but this is not the same as saying that a weight training set is itself an aerobic process.

=== Exercises for specific muscle groups ===
{{Main|Weight training exercises}}
[[File:RomanChairBackExtension.JPG|thumb|right|400px|A ''back extension''.]]
Weight trainers commonly divide the body's [[List of muscles in the human body|individual muscles]] into ten major muscle groups. These do not include the [[hip]], [[neck]] and [[forearm]] muscles, which are rarely trained in isolation. The most common exercises for these muscle groups are listed below.

The sequence shown below is one possible way to order the exercises. The large muscles of the lower body are normally trained before the smaller muscles of the [[Upper body strength|upper body]], because these first exercises require more mental and physical energy. The core muscles of the [[torso]] are trained before the [[shoulder]] and [[arm]] muscles that assist them. Exercises often alternate between "pushing" and "pulling" movements to allow their specific supporting muscles time to recover. The stabilizing muscles in the [[waist]] should be trained last.

=== Advanced techniques ===
A number of techniques have been developed to make weight training exercises more intense, and thereby potentially increase the rate of progress. Many weight lifters use these techniques to bring themselves past a plateau, a duration where a weightlifter may be unable to do more lifting repetitions, sets, or use higher weight resistance.

==== Set structure ====

===== Drop sets =====
A drop set is an easy method of strength training where you perform a set of any exercise to failure or right before failure, and then reduce the weight and continue to lift for more repetitions with the decreased weight.

===== Pyramid sets =====
Pyramid sets are weight training sets in which the progression is from lighter weights with a greater number of repetitions in the first set, to heavier weights with fewer repetitions in subsequent sets.

A reverse pyramid is the opposite in which the heavier weights are used at the beginning and progressively lightened.

===== Burnouts =====
Burnouts combine pyramids and drop sets, working up to higher weights with low reps and then back down to lower weights and high reps.There are a few different ways one could perform burnout sets but the main idea is to perform an exercise until failure. You should start with a weight that is 75% of the amount of the maximum amount of weight you can lift for 1 rep. Once you’ve performed the exercise to exhaustion, reduce the weight and perform another set until failure, which will usually consist of much fewer repetitions. Burnout sets sound very similar to supersets but there are differences in the results they produce. Supersets help increase muscle mass, but are more efficient for producing muscle definition and shape. Burnout sets help increase muscle growth because of the buildup of lactic acid in the muscle when it’s forced to the point of failure.

===== Diminishing set =====
The diminishing set method is where a weight is chosen that can be lifted for 20 reps in one set, and then 70 repetitions are performed in as few sets as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Robert and Ross, Don (1988). ''Muscleblasting! Brief and Brutal Shock Training''. Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. {{ISBN|0-8069-6758-7}}. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Rest-pause =====
The rest-pause training method takes one whole set and breaks it down into a few mini sets. There are two different goals that are associated with rest-pause training, you could use it to increase hypertrophy or increase strength. To increase hypertrophy you would perform a set with weight you are comfortable lifting for 6-10 reps and then set the weight down. Next, take 15 seconds worth of deep breaths and pick the weight back up and lift to failure. Lastly, repeat step two as many times as you want but it is commonly done twice. In order to increase strength using rest-pause method first you would choose a weight that is 85-95% of your one rep max. Then you would perform 1 rep with this weight and follow that up with a 30-45 second break. Then you could repeat this process as many times as you’d like.

===== Giant set =====
The Giant set, is a form of training that targets one muscle group (e.g. the triceps) with four separate exercises performed in quick succession, often to failure and sometimes with the reduction of weight halfway through a set once muscle fatigue sets in. This form of intense training 'shocks' the muscles and as such, is usually performed by experienced trainers and should be used infrequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2000|title=Heat Shock Protein Expression is Increased in Cardiac and Skeletal Muscles of Fischer 344 Rats After Endurance Training|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-445X.2000.01894.x/full|journal=Experimental Physiology|volume=85|issue=1|pages=97–102|doi=10.1111/j.1469-445X.2000.01894.x|last1=Samelman|first1=T. R.|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== {{anchor|Superset}}Combined sets ====
;Supersets: Supersets combine two or more exercises with similar motions to maximize the amount of work of an individual muscle or group of muscles.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The exercises are performed with no rest period between the exercises. An example would be doing bench press, which predominantly works the pectoralis and triceps muscles, and then moving to an exercise that works just the triceps such as the triceps extension or the pushdown.

;Push-pull supersets: Push-pull supersets are similar to regular supersets, but exercises are chosen which work opposing muscle groups. This is especially popular when applied to arm exercises, for example by combining biceps curls with the triceps pushdown. Other examples include the shoulder press and lat pulldown combination, and the bench press and wide grip row combination.

;Pre-exhaustion: Pre-exhaustion combines an isolation exercise with a compound exercise for the same muscle group. The isolation exercise first exhausts the muscle group, and then the compound exercise uses the muscle group's supporting muscles to push it further than would otherwise be possible. For example, the triceps muscles normally help the pectorals perform their function. But in the "bench press" the weaker triceps often fails first, which limits the impact on the pectorals. By preceding the bench press with the pec fly, the pectorals can be pre-exhausted so that both muscles fail at the same time, and both benefit equally from the exercise.

;Breakdowns: Breakdowns were developed by [[Frederick Hatfield]] and [[Mike Quinn (bodybuilder)|Mike Quinn]] to work the different types of [[muscle fiber]]s for maximum stimulation. Three different exercises that work the same muscle group are selected, and used for a superset. The first exercise uses a heavy weight (~85% of [[1 rep max]]) for around five reps, the second a medium weight (~70% of 1 rep max) for around twelve reps, and finally the third exercise is performed with a light weight (~50% of 1 rep max) for twenty to thirty reps, or even lighter (~40% of 1 rep max) for forty or more reps. ([[Training to failure|Going to failure]] is discouraged.) The entire superset is performed three times.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Robert and Ross, Don (1988). ''Muscleblasting! Brief and Brutal Shock Training''. Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. {{ISBN|0-8069-6758-7}}. pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Beyond failure ====
;Forced reps: Forced reps occur after momentary muscular failure. An assistant provides just enough help to get the weight trainer past the [[sticking point]] of the exercise, and allow further repetitions to be completed. Weight trainers often do this when they are [[spotting (weight training)|spotting]] their exercise partner. With some exercises forced reps can be done without a training partner. For example, with one-arm ''biceps curls'' the other arm can be used to assist the arm that is being trained.

;Cheat reps: [[Cheating#Strength training|Cheating]] is a deliberate compromise of [[Form (exercise)|form]] to maximize reps. Cheating has the advantage that it can be done without a training partner, but compromises [[Strength training#Safety|safety]]. A typical example of cheat reps occurs during biceps curls when, beginning with the load at the waist, the exerciser swings the barbell or dumbbell forward and up during the concentric phase utilizing momentum to assist their bicep muscles in moving the load to a shortened muscle position. Momentum assistance during the concentric phase allows them to move greater loads during the more difficult concentric phase. The objective can be to position greater loads of resistance to the biceps in preparation of performing the eccentric phase than the more difficult concentric phase would otherwise allow. Replacing a typical function of a training partner with a solo exerciser performing cheat reps facilitates forced reps or [[negative repetition|negative reps]] when training alone.

;Weight stripping a.k.a. Number Setting: Weight stripping is a technique used after failure with a normal resistance in certain exercises, particularly with easily adjustable machines, whereby the weight trainer or a partner gradually reduces the resistance after a full set is taken to failure. With each reduction in resistance, as many possible reps are completed and the resistance is then reduced again. This is continued until the resistance is approximately half the original resistance.

;Negative reps: [[Negative repetition|Negative reps]] are performed with much heavier weights. Assistants lift the weight, and then the weight trainer attempts to resist its downward progress through an eccentric contraction. Alternatively, an individual can use an exercise machine for negatives by lifting the weight with both arms or legs, and then lowering it with only one. Or they can simply lower weights more slowly than they lift them: for example, by taking two seconds to lift each weight and four seconds to lower it.

;Partial reps: Partial reps, as the name implies, involves movement through only part of the normal path of an exercise. Partial reps can be performed with heavier weights. Usually, only the easiest part of the repetition is attempted.

;Burns: Burns involve mixing partial reps into a set of full range reps in order to increase intensity. The partials can be performed at any part of the exercise movement, depending on what works best for the particular exercise. Also, the partials can either be added after the end of a set or in some alternating fashion with the full range reps.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Robert and Weis, Dennis (1986) ''Mass!, New Scientific Bodybuilding Secrets''. Contemporary Books. {{ISBN|0-8092-4940-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, after performing a set of ''biceps curls'' to failure, an individual would cheat the bar back to the most contracted position, and then perform several partial reps.

==== Other techniques ====
;Progressive movement training: Progressive movement training attempts to gradually increase the [[range of motion]] throughout a training cycle. The lifter will start with a much heavier weight than they could handle in the full range of motion, only moving through the last 3–5" of the movement.  Throughout the training cycle, the lifter will gradually increase the range of motion until the joint moves through the full range of the exercise.  This is a style that was made popular by Paul Anderson.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

;Time under tension: Time under tension or TUT repetitions are performed with lighter weights. Time under tension refers to the amount of time your muscle under stress during a set. This consists of the time spent in the concentric or the shortening phase, peak contraction phase, as well as the eccentric or the lengthening phase. For example, if you go perform a set of 10 reps and each rep takes 3 seconds to complete, your muscle is under tension for a total of 30 seconds. If you were to perform the same exercise but if you spent 2 seconds in the concentric phase, 1 second to stop during peak contraction, and 3 seconds to lower the weight during the eccentric phase of the rep, the same 10 reps would end up putting your muscles under tension for about 60 seconds.

[[File:WristStrap.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Using a wrist strap.]]

;Wrist straps: Wrist straps (lifting straps) are sometimes used to assist in gripping very heavy weights. Wrist straps can be used to isolate muscle groups like in "lat pull-downs", where the trainee would primarily use the latissimus dorsi muscles of the back rather than the biceps. They are particularly useful for the ''deadlift''. Some lifters avoid using wrist straps to develop their [[grip strength]], just as some go further by using thick bars. Wrist straps can allow a lifter initially to use more weight than they might be able to handle safely for an entire set, as unlike simply holding a weight, if it is dropped then the lifter must descend with it or be pulled down. Straps place stress on the bones of the wrist which can be potentially harmful if excessive.

== Combined techniques ==
Strength training may involve the combining of different training methods such as weight training, plyometrics, bodyweight exercises, and ballistic exercises. This is often done in order to improve a person's ability to apply their strength quickly. Or in other words, to improve their ability to apply explosive power.

=== Loaded plyometrics ===
Loaded plyometrics involve the addition of weights to jumping exercises. The weights may be held or worn. For instance, vertical jumps whilst holding a trap bar or jumping split squats whilst holding dumbbells. This helps to enhance the explosive power of the athlete.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Derek, Kennelly, Steve, 'Equipment' in ''Plyometric Anatomy'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complex training ===
Complex training, also known as contrast training, involves the alternation of weight training and plyometric exercises. Ideally, both sets of exercises should move through similar ranges of movement; such a pairing is called a complex, or contrast, pair. For instance, a set of heavy back squats at about 85-95% 1RM followed by a set of jumping exercises. The intention is to utilise the intense nervous system activation and increased muscle fibre recruitment from the heavy lift in the plyometric exercise; thereby increasing the power with which it can be performed. Over a period of training, this may result in the athlete being able to perform the plyometric exercise more powerfully, without the requirement of the preceding heavy lift.&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, Steven J. &amp; Kraemer, William J., ‘Complex Training, or Contrast Loading’ in ''Designing Resistance Training Programmes'', Human Kinetics: Leeds, 2013, p.253&lt;/ref&gt; Working on the same principles, a sports specific action may be incorporated instead of the plyometric exercise; the intention, in this case, being to increase the athlete's ability to perform the sports specific action more powerfully.

=== Ballistic training ===
Ballistic training, sometimes referred to as power training, is based upon the principle of maximising the acceleration phase of the exercise and minimising the deceleration phase; this helps to improve the athlete's explosive power. On this basis, ballistic training may include exercises which involve the throwing of a weight, such as a medicine ball, or jumping whilst holding or wearing a weight.&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, Steven J. &amp; Kraemer, William J., 'Ballistic Training' in ''Designing Resistance Training Programmes'', Human Kinetics:Leeds, 2013, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contrast loading ===
Contrast loading is the alternation of heavy and light loads i.e. a heavy bench press set at about 85-95% 1RM followed by a light bench press set at about 30-60% 1RM. The heavy set should be performed fast with the light set being performed as fast as possible. The joints should not be locked as this inhibits muscle fibre recruitment and reduces the speed at which the exercise can be performed. A loaded plyometric exercise, or ballistic exercise, may take the place of the light lift.

Similarly to complex training, contrast loading relies on the intense nervous system activation and enhanced muscle fibre recruitment from the heavy lift to help improve the power with which the subsequent exercise can be performed.&lt;ref&gt;McGuigan, Mike, ‘Contrast Training’ in ''Developing Power'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2017, 196-197&lt;/ref&gt; This physiological effect is commonly referred to as post-activation potentiation, or the PAP effect. By way of explanation, if a light weight is lifted, and then a heavy weight is lifted, and then the same light weight is lifted again, then the light weight will feel lighter the second time it is lifted. This is due to the increased PAP effect from the heavy lift allowing for greater power to be applied and thus making the subsequent lighter lift feel even lighter than before. Explosive power training programmes are frequently designed to specifically utilise the PAP effect.

== Risks and concerns ==
{{Howto|section|date=July 2009}}
Strength training is a safe form of exercise when the movements are controlled, and carefully defined. Or some safety measures can also be taken before the training. However, as with any form of exercise, improper execution and the failure to take appropriate precautions can result in injury. A helmet, boots, gloves, and back belt can aide in injury prevention. Principles of [[Weight training#Safety|weight training safety]] apply to strength training.

=== Bodybuilding ===
{{Main|Bodybuilding}}
[[Bodybuilding]] is a sport in which the goal is to increase muscle size and definition. Bodybuilding increases the endurance of muscles, as well as strength, though not as much as if it were the primary goal. Bodybuilders compete in bodybuilding competitions, and use specific principles and methods of strength training to maximize muscular size and develop extremely low levels of [[adipose tissue|body fat]]. In contrast, most strength trainers train to improve their strength and endurance while not giving special attention to reducing body fat below normal. Strength trainers tend to focus on compound exercises to build basic strength, whereas bodybuilders often use isolation exercises to visually separate their muscles, and to improve muscular [[symmetry]]. Pre-contest training for bodybuilders is different again, in that they attempt to retain as much muscular tissue as possible while undergoing severe [[dieting]]. However, the bodybuilding community has been the source of many strength training principles, techniques, vocabulary, and customs.

=== Nutrition ===
It is widely accepted that strength training must be matched by changes in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] in order to be effective. Although aerobic exercise has been proven to have an effect on the dietary intake of macronutrients, strength training has not &lt;ref name="IS2008"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Self-reported dietary intake following endurance, resistance and concurrent endurance and resistance training|journal=Journal of Sports Science &amp; Medicine|volume=7|issue=2|pages=255–59|pmc=3761454|pmid=24149458|author=Shaw, B.S.|author2=Shaw, I.|author3=Brown, G.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an increase in dietary [[protein]] is generally believed to be required for building skeletal muscle.

A review of 49 research studies found that supplementation of protein in the diet of healthy adults increased the size and strength of muscles during prolonged resistance exercise training; protein intakes of greater than 1.6 g/kg/day did not additionally increase fat-free mass or muscle size or strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morton RW, Murphy KT, McKellar SR, Schoenfeld BJ, Henselmans M, Helms E, Aragon AA, Devries MC, Banfield L, Krieger JW, Phillips SM |title=A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of the effect of protein supplementation on resistance training-induced gains in muscle mass and strength in healthy adults |journal=Br J Sports Med |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=376–384 |date=March 2018 |pmid=28698222 |pmc=5867436 |doi=10.1136/bjsports-2017-097608 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protein that is neither needed for cell growth and repair nor consumed for energy is converted into urea mainly through the deamination process and is excreted by the kidneys. It was once thought that a high-protein diet entails risk of [[kidney]] damage, but studies have shown that kidney problems only occur in people with previous [[kidney disease]]. However failure to properly hydrate can put an increased strain on the kidney's ability to function.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, Lisa. [http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art14944.asp "Low Carb, Atkins and Kidneys"]. bellaonline.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2005|title=High-protein diets are not hazardous for the healthy kidneys|journal=Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation|volume=20|issue=3|pages=657–58; author reply 658|doi=10.1093/ndt/gfh645|pmid=15735253|author=Manninen AH.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adequate supply of [[Carbohydrate#Nutrition|carbohydrates]] (5–7&amp;nbsp;g per kg) is also needed as a source of energy and for the body to restore [[glycogen]] levels in muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2004|title=Regulation of muscle glycogen repletion, muscle protein synthesis and repair following exercise|journal=Journal of sports science &amp; medicine|volume=3|issue=3|pages=131–38|pmc=3905295|pmid=24482590|author1=Ivy|first1=J. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A light, balanced meal prior to the workout (usually one to two hours beforehand) ensures that adequate energy and amino acids are available for the intense bout of exercise. The type of nutrients consumed affects the response of the body, and [[nutrient timing]] whereby protein and carbohydrates are consumed prior to and after workout has a beneficial impact on muscle growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2004|title=Influence of nutrition on responses to resistance training|url=http://www.purdue.edu/swo/nutrition/KnowItAll/HealthyWeightGain/InfluenceOfNutritionOnWtGain.pdf|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|volume=36|issue=4|pages=689–96|doi=10.1249/01.mss.0000121944.19275.c4|pmid=15064597|author1=Volek|first1=J. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is consumed throughout the course of the workout to prevent poor performance due to [[dehydration]]. A protein shake is often consumed immediately&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Hayes|year=2006|title=Effects of supplement timing and resistance exercise on skeletal muscle hypertrophy|url=http://eprints.vu.edu.au/1436/1/MSSE2006_(3).pdf|journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc|volume=38|issue=11|pages=1918–25|doi=10.1249/01.mss.0000233790.08788.3e|pmid=17095924|author=Cribb PJ, Hayes A}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the workout, because both protein uptake and protein usage are increased at this time.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Glucose (or another simple sugar) is often consumed as well since this quickly replenishes any [[glycogen]] lost during the exercise period.
To maximise muscle protein anabolism, recovery drink should contain glucose (dextrose), protein (usually [[whey]]) hydrolysate containing mainly dipeptides and tripeptides, and [[leucine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Hyperinsulinaemia, hyperaminoacidaemia and post-exercise muscle anabolism: the search for the optimal recovery drink|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=40|issue=11|pages=900–05|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2006.030031|pmc=2465040|pmid=16950882|author=Manninen AH.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some weight trainers also take [[ergogenic aid]]s such as [[creatine]] or [[steroid]]s to aid muscle growth. However, the effectiveness of some products is disputed and others are potentially harmful.

=== Sex differences in mass gains ===

Due to the androgenic hormonal differences between males and females, the latter are generally unable to develop large muscles regardless of the training program used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://us.commercial.lifefitness.com/content.cfm/strengthtrainingforwomen_1 |title=Strength Training for Women |publisher=IDEA Personal Trainer |last=Freedson |first=PS |accessdate=2008-02-06 |date=2000-07-01 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716223517/http://us.commercial.lifefitness.com/content.cfm/strengthtrainingforwomen_1 |archivedate=July 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the most that can be achieved is a look similar to that of a [[fitness and figure competition|fitness model]]. Muscle is [[density|denser]] than fat, so someone who builds muscle while keeping the same body weight will occupy less volume; if two people weigh the same (and are the same height) but have different lean body mass percentages, the one with more muscle will appear thinner.&lt;ref name="Ebben"&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 1998|title=Strength training for women: Debunking myths that block opportunity|journal=The Physician and Sportsmedicine|volume=26|issue=5|pages=86–97|doi=10.3810/psm.1998.05.1020|pmid=20086816|author=Ebben, W.P.|author2=Jensen, R.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, though bodybuilding uses the same principles as strength training, it is with a goal of gaining muscle bulk.  Strength trainers with different goals and programs will not gain the same mass as a professional bodybuilder.

=== Muscle toning ===
{{More citations needed|date=February 2012}}
Some weight trainers perform light, high-repetition exercises in an attempt to "tone" their muscles without increasing their size.

The word tone derives from the Latin "tonus" (meaning "tension"). In anatomy and physiology, as well as medicine, the term "muscle tone" refers to the continuous and passive partial contraction of the muscles, or the muscles' resistance to passive stretching during resting state as determined by a deep tendon reflex. [[Muscle tone|Muscle tonus]] is dependent on neurological input into the muscle. In medicine, observations of changes in muscle tonus can be used to determine normal or abnormal states which can be indicative of pathology. The common strength training term "tone" is derived from this use.

What muscle builders refer to as a ''toned physique'' or "muscle firmness" is one that combines reasonable muscular size with moderate levels of body fat, qualities that may result from a combination of diet and exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Lies, Damned Lies, and Muscle Tone | publisher = CrossFit Impulse|url=http://crossfitimpulse.com/lies-damned-lies-and-muscle-tone/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscle tone or firmness is derived from the increase in [[actin]] and [[myosin]] cross filaments in the [[sarcomere]]. When this occurs the same amount of neurological input creates a greater firmness or tone in the resting continuous and passive partial contraction in the muscle.

Exercises of 6–12 reps cause hypertrophy of the [[sarcoplasm]] in [[Skeletal muscle#Skeletal muscle fiber types|slow-twitch and high-twitch muscle fibers]], contributing to overall increased muscle bulk. This is not to be confused with [[myofibril]] hypertrophy which leads to strength gains. Both however can occur to an extent during this rep range. ''Even though most are of the opinion that higher repetitions are best for producing the desired effect of muscle firmness or tone, it is not.'' Low volume strength training of 5 repetitions or fewer will increase strength by increasing [[actin]] and [[myosin]] cross filaments thereby increasing muscle firmness or tone. The low volume of this training will inhibit the hypertrophy effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 1995|title=Capillary growth in chick skeletal muscle with normal maturation and hypertrophy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0034568795000607|journal=Respiration Physiology|volume=102|issue=2–3|pages=293–301|doi=10.1016/0034-5687(95)00060-7|pmid=8904020|last1=Snyder|first1=Gregory K.|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowered-calorie diets have no positive effect on [[muscle hypertrophy]] for muscle of any  fiber type. They may, however, decrease the thickness of [[subcutaneous fat]] (fat between muscle and skin), through an overall reduction in body fat, thus making muscle striations more visible.

=== Weight loss ===
Exercises like sit-ups, or abdominal crunches, performs less work than whole-body aerobic exercises&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.physsportsmed.com/issues/1997/06jun/sit_up.htm | last = Stamford | first = B | year = 1997 | title = The right way to do sit-ups | journal = The Physician and Sportsmedicine | volume = 25 | issue = 6|doi=10.3810/psm.1997.06.1433| doi-broken-date = 2018-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby expending fewer calories during exercise than jogging, for example.

Hypertrophy serves to maintain muscle mass, for an elevated [[basal metabolic rate]], which has the potential to burn more calories in a given period compared to aerobics. This helps to maintain a higher metabolic rate which would otherwise diminish after metabolic adaption to dieting, or upon completion of an aerobic routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=R.E.|year=2003|title=Physical activity and weight management: Building the case for exercise|journal=The Physical and Sportsmedicine|volume=31|issue=9|pages=39–45|doi=10.3810/psm.2003.11.557|pmid=20086447|author2=Jakicic, J.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight loss also depends on the type of strength training used. Weight training is generally used for bulking, but the bulking method will more than likely not increase weight because of the diet involved. However, when resistance or circuit training is used, because they are not geared towards bulking, women tend to lose weight more quickly. Lean muscles require calories to maintain themselves at rest, which will help reduce fat through an increase in the [[basal metabolic rate]].

== History ==
[[File:EarlyBarbell.png|right|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Saxon]] performing a [[Two Hands Anyhow]] with an early [[kettlebell]] and plate-loaded [[barbell]].]]
Until the 20th century, the history of strength training was very similar to the history of weight training. With the advent of modern technology, materials and knowledge, the methods that can be used for strength training have multiplied significantly.

[[Hippocrates]] explained the principle behind strength training when he wrote "that which is used develops, and that which is not used wastes away", referring to muscular [[Muscle hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] and [[Atrophy#Muscle atrophies|atrophy]]. Progressive resistance training dates back at least to [[Ancient Greece]], when legend has it that wrestler [[Milo of Croton]] trained by carrying a newborn [[calf]] on his back every day until it was fully grown. Another Greek, the physician [[Galen]], described strength training exercises using the [[halteres (ancient Greece)|halteres]] (an early form of [[dumbbell]]) in the 2nd century.  Ancient [[Persia]]ns used the [[Indian club|''meels'']], which became popular during the 19th century as the Indian club, and has recently made a comeback in the form of the clubbell.

The dumbbell was joined by the [[barbell]] in the latter half of the 19th century. Early barbells had hollow globes that could be filled with [[sand]] or [[lead shot]], but by the end of the century these were replaced by the plate-loading barbell commonly used today.&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite journal |last=Todd |first=Jan |year=1995 |format=PDF |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/IGH/IGH0306/IGH0306c.pdf |title=From Milo to Milo: A History of Barbells, Dumbells&lt;!--sic--&gt;, and Indian Clubs |journal=Iron Game History |volume=3 |issue=6 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength training with [[isometric exercise]] was popularised by [[Charles Atlas]] from the 1930s onwards. The 1960s saw the gradual introduction of [[exercise machine]]s into the still-rare strength training gyms of the time. Strength training became increasingly popular in the 1980s following the release of the bodybuilding movie ''[[Pumping Iron]]'' and the subsequent popularity of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref name=U.S.C.D.P.&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13956966/ "Sculpted trend spurs women to pump iron"].

=== Safety concerns related to children ===
[[File:Kids power training.jpeg|thumb|Properly supervised strength training for children.]]
[[Orthopedic surgery|Orthopaedic]] specialists used to recommend that children avoid weight training because the [[growth plate]]s on their [[bone]]s might be at risk. The very rare reports of growth plate fractures in children who trained with weights occurred as a result of inadequate supervision, improper form or excess weight, and there have been no reports of injuries to growth plates in youth training programs that followed established guidelines.&lt;ref name = KH&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/nutrition_fit/fitness/strength_training.html | title = Strength Training and Your Child | publisher = kidshealth.org | last = Dowshen | first = S |author2=Homeier B  | accessdate = 2008-01-18 | date = 2005-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NSCA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Youth%20Hot%20Topics.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2008-01-18 |publisher=National Strength and Conditioning Association |last=Faigenbaum |first=AD |title=Youth Resistance Training |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717045321/http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Youth%20Hot%20Topics.pdf |archivedate=July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the National Strength and Conditioning Association is that strength training is safe for children if properly designed and supervised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/YouthforWeb.pdf |format=pdf |title=Position statement:  Youth Resistance Training |publisher=National Strength and Conditioning Association |accessdate=2008-01-18 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717045336/http://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/YouthforWeb.pdf |archivedate=July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger children are at greater risk of injury than adults if they drop a weight on themselves or perform an exercise incorrectly; further, they may lack understanding of, or ignore the safety precautions around weight training equipment.  As a result, supervision of minors is considered vital to ensuring the safety of any youth engaging in strength training.&lt;ref name = KH /&gt;&lt;ref name = NSCA /&gt;

==== Australia's stance on pre-adolescence strength training  ====
Strength training is the fourth most popular form of fitness in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, S. (2015). [http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/diet-and-fitness/top-fitness-trends-for-2015-20150106-12j220.html Top fitness trends for 2015]. ''The Sydney Morning Herald''&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its popularity amongst all ages, there is great scepticism on what the appropriate age to commence strength training in young athletes is. Some points of the opposing view of strength training in young adolescence are stunted growth, health and bone problems in later stages of life and unhealthy eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;Stenson, J. (2003). [http://www.nbcnews.com/Default.aspx?id=3076614&amp;p1=0#.VzrQuJF97ic Should kids pump iron?]. msnbc.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by Australian experts that have been recognised by the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS) have debunked these myths. There is no link between any prolonged health risks and strength training in pre-adolescence if the procedures of strength training are followed correctly and under suitable supervision. Strength training for pre-adolescents should focus on skills and techniques. Children should only work on strengthening all the big muscle groups, using free weight and body weight movements with relatively light loads. The benefits of these practices include increased strength performance, injury prevention and learning good training principles.&lt;ref&gt;Sibte, N.

=== For older adults ===
Older adults are prone to loss of muscle strength.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Progressive resistance strength training for improving physical function in older adults|journal=International Journal of Older People Nursing|volume=6|issue=3|pages=244–46|doi=10.1111/j.1748-3743.2011.00291.x|pmid=21884490|author=Christie, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Chiung-Ju|last2=Latham|first2=Nancy K.|date=2009-07-08|title=Progressive resistance strength training for improving physical function in older adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=3|pages=CD002759|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002759.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=4324332|pmid=19588334}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more strength older adults have  better health, better [[quality of life]], better physical function&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and fewer [[Falling (accident)|falls]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In cases in which an older person begins strength training, their doctor or health care provider may neglect to emphasize a strength training program which results in muscle gains.

In setting up an exercise program for an older adult, they should go through a [[Baseline (medicine)|baseline]] fitness assessment to determine their current limits. Any exercise program for older adults should match the intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise that the person can perform. The program should have a goal of increased strength as compared to the baseline measurement.&lt;ref name="APTAfive" /&gt;

Recommended training for older adults is three times a week of light strength training exercises. Exercise machines are a commonly used equipment in a gym setting, including treadmills with exercises such as walking or light jogging. Home-based exercises should usually consist of body weight or elastic band exercises that maintain a low level of impact on the muscles. Weights can also be used by older adults if they maintain a lighter weight load with an average amount of repetitions (10–12 reps) with suitable supervision. It is important for older adults to maintain a light level of strength training with low levels of impact to avoid injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Progressive resistance strength training can reduce physical disability in older adults|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=46|issue=5|pages=323–24|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2012-091018|pmid=22442190|author1=Keuerleber, J.|author2=Henschke, N.|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older people who exercise against a resistance or force become stronger .&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Progressive resistance training (PRT)  also improves physical functioning in older people, including the performance of  simple (e.g.: walking, climbing stairs, rising from a chair more quickly) and complex daily activities (e.g.: bathing, cooking).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Caution is recommended when transferring PRT exercises for clinical populations, as adverse effects are unclear.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''The Swedish Parkinson Academy''' ({{lang-sv|Svenska Parkinsonakademien}}; SPA) was founded in 2007 and is based at [[Lund University]] in [[Sweden]].

The main aim of the academy is to stimulate [[medical research|preclinical]] and [[clinical research]] related to [[Parkinson's disease]], especially to support [[translational research|translational projects]] (projects bridging the border between preclinical and clinical research, bringing promising preclinical results to clinical studies).

Main research areas include:
*methods for early diagnosis ([[biomarker]]s),
*[[neuroprotective]] therapies ([[growth factors]]),
*restorative therapies ([[cell therapy|cell]] and [[gene therapy]]), and
*improved methods for evaluation of symptomatology and effect of therapy.

The SPA employs (partly or fully) ten scientists and is led by a steering group consisting of representatives from preclinical and clinical [[neuroscience]] as well as patient organizations. SPA organizes education and meetings regarding Parkinson's disease, on Swedish and international level.

'''World AIDS Day''', designated on 1 December every year since 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About World Aids Day|url=http://www.worldaidsday.org/about-world-aids-day.php|website=worldaidsday.org|publisher=National Aids Trust|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[list of minor secular observances#December|international day]] dedicated to [[raising awareness]] of the [[AIDS pandemic]] caused by the spread of [[HIV]] infection and mourning those who have died of the disease. Government and health officials, non-governmental organizations, and individuals around the world observe the day, often with education on [[AIDS prevention]] and control.

World AIDS Day is one of the eight official [[global health|global public health]] campaigns marked by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), along with [[World Health Day]], [[World Blood Donor Day]], [[World Immunization Week]], [[World Tuberculosis Day]], [[World No Tobacco Day]], [[World Malaria Day]] and [[World Hepatitis Day]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/en WHO campaigns.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2017}}, AIDS has killed between 28.9&amp;nbsp;million and 41.5&amp;nbsp;million people worldwide, and an estimated 36.7&amp;nbsp;million people are living with HIV,&lt;ref name="UNAIDS2017"&gt;[http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet Fact sheet - Latest statistics on the status of the AIDS epidemic] UNAIDS. Accessed 30 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the most important global [[public health]] issues in [[recorded history]]. Thanks to recent improved access to [[antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral treatment]] in many regions of the world, the death rate from AIDS epidemic has decreased since its peak in 2005 (1&amp;nbsp;million in 2016, compared to 1.9&amp;nbsp;million in 2005).&lt;ref name="UNAIDS2017"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:AidsRusStamp1993.jpg|thumb|right|208px|Russian stamp, 1993]]
World AIDS Day was first conceived in August 1987 by James W. Bunn and Thomas Netter, two public information officers for the Global Programme on AIDS at the [[World Health Organization]] in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|title=NPR: How World AIDS Day Began|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/01/143017936/how-world-aids-day-began}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, International News, "World AIDS Day Co-Founder Looks Back 20 Years Later", CDC HIV/Hepatitis/STD/TB Prevention News Update, 12 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Bunn and Netter took their idea to Dr. Jonathan Mann, Director of the Global Programme on AIDS (now known as [[UNAIDS]]). Dr. Mann liked the concept, approved it, and agreed with the recommendation that the first observance of World AIDS Day should be on 1 December 1988.&lt;ref name=newsworks&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventors of World AIDS Day: James Bunn and Thomas Netter|url=http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local//speak-easy/30571-inventors-of-world-aids-day-james-bunn-and-thomas-netter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bunn, a former television broadcast journalist from San Francisco, had recommended the date of 1 December that believing it would maximize coverage of World AIDS Day by western news media, sufficiently long following the US elections but before the Christmas holidays.&lt;ref name=newsworks/&gt;

In its first two years, the theme of World AIDS Day focused on children and young people. While the choice of this theme was criticized at the time by some for ignoring the fact that people of all ages may become infected with HIV, the theme helped alleviate some of the stigma surrounding the disease and boost recognition of the problem as a family disease.&lt;ref name="Speicher" /&gt;

The [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]] (UNAIDS) became operational in 1996, and it took over the planning and promotion of World AIDS Day.&lt;ref name="Speicher"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/130044.php |author= Speicher, Sara| title= "World AIDS Day Marks 20th Anniversary Of Solidarity." |work= Medical News Today  |publisher=Medicalnewstoday.com |date= 19 November 2008 |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than focus on a single day, UNAIDS created the World AIDS Campaign in 1997 to focus on year-round communications, prevention and education.&lt;ref name="Speicher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Soest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/Resources/FeatureStories/archive/2006/20061020_Interview_Marcel_van_Soest.asp |title=van Soest, Marcel.

Vol. 59. Geneva, Switzerland: United Nations Publications, 2007. {{ISBN|92-1-100967-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, Popes [[John Paul II]] and [[Benedict XVI]] have released a greeting message for patients and doctors on World AIDS Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/1988/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19881128_aids_it.html |title=First World AIDS Day in 1988 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthpastoral.org/text.php?cid=267&amp;sec=4&amp;docid=21&amp;lang=en Message for the World AIDS Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304103134/http://www.healthpastoral.org/text.php?cid=267&amp;sec=4&amp;docid=21&amp;lang=en |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gheddo |first=Piero |url=http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=4758 |title=Pope: "I feel near to people with AIDS and their families" |publisher=Asianews.it |date= |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:65e95Hr5YywJ:data.unaids.org/pub/PressStatement/2006/World%2520AIDS%2520Day%2520-%2520CI%2520Statement%25202006%2520-%2520Eng.pdf+aids+day+pope+2006&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;sig=AHIEtbT8DSFpREHZcQo4yw6rDo64M8Xw8w Message of Caritas Internationalis On Occasion of World AIDS Day 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pullella |first=Philip |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2007/11/30/pope-skirts-condoms-issue-in-world-aids-day-statement/ |title=Pope skirts condoms issue in World AIDS Day statement |publisher=Blogs.reuters.com |date= |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a collection of HIV and AIDS related [[NGOs]] (including [[Panagea Global AIDS]] and [[The AIDS and Rights Alliance for Southern Africa]]) started a campaign to rename World AIDS Day to World HIV Day. They claim the change will put the emphasis on social justice issues, and the advancement of treatments like [[PrEP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The World Has Changed: The HIV Response Must Change Too On World HIV Day|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/12/prweb13888541.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the [[White House]] began marking World AIDS Day with the iconic display of a {{convert|28|foot|m}} AIDS Ribbon on the building's North Portico in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two-Story AIDS Ribbon at White House|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2007/11/the-2-story-tal/|author= Jennifer Parker| publisher=ABC News|date=30 November 2007| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729222802/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2007/11/the-2-story-tal/| archivedate= 29 July 2013| accessdate= 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=Proclamation 8207: World AIDS Day, 2007 |wslink=Proclamation 8207 |date=29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; White House aid Steven M.

Since 1993, the President of the United States has made an official [[List of observances in the United States by presidential proclamation|proclamation]] for World AIDS Day (see section [[#US Presidential Proclamations for World AIDS Day]] for copies of those proclamations). On 30 November 2017, President [[Donald Trump]] proclaimed ''World AIDS Day'' for 1 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[White House Office of the Press Secretary|Office of the Press Secretary]]|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/11/30/president-donald-j-trump-proclaims-december-1-2017-world-aids-day|title=President Donald J.

==Themes==
All the World AIDS Day campaigns  focus on a specific theme, chosen following consultations with [[UNAIDS]], [[WHO]] and a large number of grassroots, national and international agencies involved in the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. As of 2008, each year's theme is chosen by the Global Steering Committee of the World AIDS Campaign (WAC).&lt;ref name="Speicher" /&gt;

For each World AIDS Day from 2005 through 2010, the theme was "Stop AIDS. Keep the Promise", designed to encourage political leaders to keep their commitment to achieve universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support by the year 2010.&lt;ref name="Speicher" /&gt;

As of 2012, the multi-year theme for World AIDS Day is "Getting to Zero: Zero new HIV infections. Zero deaths from AIDS-related illness. Zero discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2012/aids_20121129/en/ World Aids Day 2012: Closing in on global HIV targets.] Accessed 8 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The US Federal theme for the year 2014 is "''Focus, Partner, Achieve: An AIDS-Free Generation''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aids Day 2014|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/world-aids-day-2014-history-significance-theme-top-10-must-read-facts-virus-615663|publisher=ibtimes|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The themes are not limited to a single day but are used year-round in international efforts to highlight HIV/AIDS awareness within the context of other major global events including the [[Group of Eight|G8 Summit]], as well as local campaigns like the [[Student Stop AIDS Campaign]] in the UK.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1744">'''Zam system''' ({{lang-ur|زم}}) is a form of irrigation system in [[Pakistan]]. ''Zam'' means the flow of perennial water coming out of [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], whereas [[Rod Koh]] is the main torrent bed which remains usually dry, when there is no flood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spate-irrigation.org/librar/documents/HistoryofDrabanZamDIKhan_000.doc History of Daraban Zam]&lt;/ref&gt;

The flood and perennial water of the Zam is used for irrigation as well as for drinking purpose. Zam water is classified into two categories: ''Buga pani'' (flood water) and ''Kala Pani'' (perennial water). 

[[Rod Koh]] (torrent-spate-irrigation) systems go back at least as early as 330 BC and provided economic basis for some of the early civilisations. [[Alexander the Great]], according to [[Arrian]], sailed down the river [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]] to its junction with [[Indus River]]. His land forces marched in two bodies on either side of the river. They noticed some form of torrent agriculture although in a very poor state in a few locations of the [[Sulaiman Mountains|Sulaiman]] piedmont. 

Heavy rains in the catchments, which extend up to [[Balochistan region]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Sulaiman Mountains|Sulaiman Range]], [[Shirani Hills]] and [[Bhattani Range]] result in water rushing into torrents in the foothill plains, named Daman area, where torrent agriculture (Rod Kohi) is practised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spate-irrigation.org/pdf/Overview%20of%20Rod%20Kohi%20Project%20WRRI.pdf Rod-Kohi system development and management in Pakistan A National Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
