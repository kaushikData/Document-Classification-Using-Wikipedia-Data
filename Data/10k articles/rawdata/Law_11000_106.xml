The '''Protocol Amending the Agreements, Conventions and Protocols on Narcotic Drugs concluded at The Hague on 23 January 1912, at Geneva on 11 February 1925 and 19 February 1925, and 13 July 1931, at Bangkok on 27 November 1931 and at Geneva on 26 June 1936''' was a treaty, signed on 11 December 1946 at [[Lake Success, New York|Lake Success]], that shifted the drug control functions previously assigned to the [[League of Nations]] to the United Nations. As the Protocol's official title says, it modifies the provisions of the:
*1912 and 1925 [[International Opium Convention]]s,
*1931 [[Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs]], and the
*1936 [[Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs]].

Under this Protocol, the [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]], appointed by the [[UN Economic and Social Council]], took over drug policy making from the League of Nations' Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs. In an important precedent, the Supervisory Body that was created to administer the estimate system (which required nations to keep within their predetermined estimates of necessary narcotics production, imports, exports, etc.) was appointed by:
*The [[World Health Organization]] (two members)
*The Commission on Narcotic Drugs (one member)
*The Permanent Central Board (one member).
The Supervisory Body's successor, the [[International Narcotics Control Board]], also had 3 of its 13 members nominated by the World Health Organization, with the rest nominated by UN members, with nominations subject to approval by the [[UN Economic and Social Council]]. No doubt in both cases, lobbying by the pharmaceutical industries influenced the inclusion of a requirement to place some scientific and medical experts on the board. However, the influence of [[Harry J. Anslinger]] and his Canadian counterpart [[Charles Henry Ludovic Sharman]], both narcotics control officials, could be seen in the decision to allow the Commission to select some members (thus allowing law enforcement officials to be appointed to the Supervisory Body).

In accordance with the provisions of the drug control treaties, the revisions instituted by the Protocol did not require ratification to enter into force. For each party, the treaty entered into force immediately upon their (a) signature without reservation as to approval, (b) signature subject to approval followed by acceptance or (c) acceptance. Since there were far fewer independent nations in the 1940s than there are today, the Protocol's initial 40 parties &amp;ndash; including populous [[empire]]s and unions such as the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Soviet Union]] &amp;ndash; encompassed the vast majority of the world's population. As of 2013, the Protocol has 62 state parties; of the ratifying states, the Netherlands has denounced the treaty.

The Protocol was superseded by the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], except as it affected the 1936 [[Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs]]. However, the Protocol's influence can be plainly seen in the power structure established by the Single Convention, which remains in force.

[[File:Rock mort gaza 2008.JPG|thumb|200px|Monthly rocket hits in Israel in 2008, according to Israeli military-tied Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center.&lt;ref name="rockmort"/&gt;]] 
The '''2008 Israel–Hamas ceasefire''' was an [[Egypt]]ian-brokered six-month [[Tahdia]] (an Arabic term for a lull) "for the Gaza area", which went into effect between Hamas and Israel on 19 June 2008.&lt;ref name=Guardian1&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/19/israelandthepalestinians|title=Gaza militants and Israel begin fragile truce|author=Peter Walker and agencies|publisher=The Guardian |date=19 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Egyptian-brokered agreement, Israel promised to halt air strikes and other attacks, while in return, there would not be rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza. Once the ceasefire held, Israel was to gradually begin to ease its [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade of Gaza]].&lt;ref name=Guardian1 /&gt;

During the initial week of the ceasefire, Islamic Jihad militants fired rockets on Israel. Under pressure from Hamas, Islamic Jihad had agreed to abide by the temporary truce, which was meant to apply only to Gaza, but had balked at the idea of not responding to Israeli military actions in the West Bank. The New York Times reported that the Islamic Jihad action broke the Hamas-Israeli Gaza truce.&lt;ref name=kershner&gt;{{cite news |title=Rockets hit Israel, breaking Hamas truce |work=International Herald Tribune |author=Isabel Kershner |date=25 June 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/world/middleeast/25mideast.html |accessdate=16 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210013724/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/06/25/africa/25mideast.php |archivedate=10 February 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the next 5 months of the ceasefire, Gazan attacks decreased significantly for a total of 19 rocket and 18 mortar shell launchings,&lt;ref name=kershner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/data/pdf/PDF_19045_2.pdf|title=Summary of rocket fire and mortar shelling in 2008|publisher=Israel Intelligence Heritage &amp; Commemoration Center (IICC)|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to 1199 rockets and 1072 mortar shells in 2008 up to 19 June, a reduction of 98%.&lt;ref name=Sadaka&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sadaka.ie/Files/Gaza_Ceasefire.pdf |title=The Israel-Hamas ceasefire of 19 June to 4 Nov. 2008 |author=Dr. David Morrison |publisher=SADAKA |date=2 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826203113/http://sadaka.ie/Files/Gaza_Ceasefire.pdf |archivedate=26 August 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement called on Israel to increase the level of goods entering Gaza by 30 percent over the pre-lull period within 72 hours and to open all border crossings and "allow the transfer of all goods that were banned and restricted to go into Gaza" within 13 days after the beginning of the ceasefire. The increase in supplies of food, water, medicine and fuel did improve, but the increase was only to an average of about 20 percent of normal levels.&lt;ref name=Sadaka /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/07/AR2009010702645.html|title=An Unnecessary War|author=Jimmy Carter|publisher=Washington Post|date=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later the volume of goods arriving was too low to significantly improved living conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7570605.stm|title=Truce barely eases Gaza embargo|author=Aleem Maqbool |publisher=BBC News|date=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; preventing UNRWA from replenishing its stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xuQstngyHdEC&amp;pg=PT175&amp;lpg=PT175&amp;dq|title=Hopes and Prospects|author=Noam Chomsky|edition=Hardcover|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2011|isbn=978-0-241-14476-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel told U.S. officials in 2008 it would keep Gaza's economy "on the brink of collapse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/wikileaks-israel-aimed-to-keep-gaza-economy-on-brink-of-collapse-1.335354|title=WikiLeaks: Israel aimed to keep Gaza economy on brink of collapse|author=Reuters|publisher=Haaretz|date=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 2008, Israel raided Gaza, killing six Hamas militants. The Israeli military claimed the target of the raid was a tunnel that they said Hamas was planning to use to capture Israeli soldiers positioned on the border fence 250m away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/05/israelandthepalestinians|title=Gaza truce broken as Israeli raid kills six Hamas gunmen|author=Rory McCarthy|publisher=The Guardian|date=5 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas officials claimed that the tunnel was being dug for defensive purposes. Hamas replied to the Israeli attack with a barrage of rocket fire. On December 20, Hamas announced it would not renew the ceasefire. [[Operation Cast Lead]] commenced on 27 December 2008.

==Background==
{{See also|Israel-Gaza conflict}}
[[File:Number of Morter and Rocket Attacks 2001 Through 2008V5.jpg|thumb|left|325px|Number of Mortar &amp; Rocket hits in Israel]] After its [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006]] victory, Hamas assumed administrative control of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], consolidating its this control after [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|a military conflict with Fatah]].  Israel and [[Egypt]] then partially sealed their border crossings with Gaza, on the grounds that [[Fatah]] was no longer providing security.  They imposed a [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade on the territory]], prohibiting many exports and allowing only enough imported goods to avert a humanitarian or health crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abbas’s Premier Tells Israel to Reopen Gaza|work=New York Times |author=Isabel Kershner|date=14 December 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/world/middleeast/14mideast.html| accessdate=16 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111130045542/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/world/middleeast/14mideast.html| archivedate=30 November 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After many acts of violence, foreign journalists left the Gaza strip due to the lack of security in the zone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsgd.com/news/world1/200701040010.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6592055.stm | work=BBC News | title=Reporting risks leave Gaza neglected | date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2010 | first=Martin | last=Patience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the June 2007 tightening of the Israeli embargo on Gaza&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/peace/conflict_resolution/middle-east/index.html |title=Hamas, the Gaza Siege, and Palestinian Unity|publisher=The Carter Center |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas and other Palestinian paramilitias more than doubled the monthly number of [[Qassam rockets]] and mortars [[List of Qassam rocket attacks|fired from the Gaza strip into Southern Israel]]. Israel conducted airstrikes and raids against Hamas and other targets in Gaza during 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name=2007Airstrikes&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3402910,00.html |accessdate=14 January 2009 |date=21 May 2007 |publisher=Ynetnews |title=Airstrike targets Qassam cell |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106011125/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0%2C7340%2CL-3402910%2C00.html |archivedate=6 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hamas considers Israel an illegitimate state and Israel views Hamas as a terrorist group that must be dismantled.&lt;ref name=revive&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/20/world/middleeast/20mideast.html?scp=2&amp;sq=Ethan%20Bronner%20December%202008%20gaza&amp;st=cse Gaza Truce May Be Revived by Necessity]. By Ethan Bronner. ''The New York Times''. Published 19 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no mutually agreed text or enforcement mechanism in the understanding brokered between the two parties, neither of which recognizes the other, that would facilitate a formal ceasefire or armistice.&lt;ref name=revive/&gt;

After visiting Israel and Palestine in April 2008, former President [[Jimmy Carter]] stated that "Palestinian leaders from [[Gaza City|Gaza]] were noncommittal on all issues, these leaders claimed that rockets were the only way to respond to their imprisonment and to dramatize their humanitarian plight. The top Hamas leaders in Damascus, however, agreed to consider a cease-fire in Gaza only, provided Israel would not attack Gaza and would permit normal humanitarian supplies to be delivered to Palestinian citizens."&lt;ref name=nichols/&gt; Hamas was willing to consider a cease-fire in both Gaza and the [[Fatah]] controlled [[West Bank]], but the Israelis were only interested in a Gaza agreement.&lt;ref name=revive/&gt;&lt;ref name=nichols/&gt;

At the beginning of the cease-fire, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert stated that "We have no illusions. The calm is fragile and likely to be short-lived."&lt;ref name=fragile/&gt; He also said that "Hamas is the address in Gaza, and it carries responsibility for everything that happens in Gaza".&lt;ref name=fragile&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/1.4993054 Olmert: Gaza cease-fire is fragile, may be short lived]. By Amos Harel and Jack Khoury. Published 18 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas leadership had low expectations as well. Just minutes before the start, Israeli aircraft fired on a Gazan rocket launching squad, killing one militant.&lt;ref name=wash&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jun/20/olmert-says-truce-with-hamas-fragile/ Olmert: Truce with Hamas 'fragile']. By Joshua Mitnick. ''[[The Washington Times]]''. Published 20 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Prime Minister]] [[Ismail Haniyeh]] described the proposed period in Arabic as a ''[[Tahdia]]'', meaning a temporary moment of calm and not a formal cease-fire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-03-12-374518999_x.htm Hamas offering Israel truce, not peace]. ''USA Today''. Published 3/12/2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli opposition in the [[Knesset]] blasted the agreement. [[Likud]] Chairman [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] said, "This is not a relaxation, it's an Israeli agreement to the rearming of Hamas... What are we getting for this?" In Palestine, [[Palestinian Authority|Authority]] President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] praised it, and he used the lull to seek reconciliation with Hamas.&lt;ref name=wash/&gt; ''Ha'aretz'' has alleged that even at the very beginning of the cease-fire Defense Minister [[Ehud Barak]] prepared a comprehensive intelligence-gathering program setting up battle plans against Hamas.&lt;ref name=ravid/&gt;

==Ceasefire Terms==
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) summarised the key components of the ceasefire as follows: 
:“On June 19, at 6 am, the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect. As part of the ceasefire, Palestinian militants agreed to immediately halt their attacks on Israel and Israel agreed to cease its military operations in Gaza. Israel also agreed to ease its blockade of Gaza and to gradually lift its ban on the import of a large number of commodities. The ceasefire is supposed to be in force for six months.”

A report by the British House of Commons Library, published on 22 January 2009, provides Hamas’ understanding of the terms of the ceasefire: 
# Mutual agreement to cease all military activities by the start of “zero hour” on Thursday 19 June, at 6:00 AM. 
# Duration of ceasefire is six months according to agreement concluded among the national parties under Egyptian auspices. 
# Ceasefire will be implemented under national consensus and under Egyptian auspices.

==Ceasefire Progress==

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', neither side fully respected the terms of the cease-fire.&lt;ref name=revive/&gt; Hamas undertook to stop other groups from firing rockets at Israel. It took some days, but it was largely successful, with Hamas imposing its will and even imprisoning some of those who were firing rockets. Nonetheless some rockets still continued to be fired from Gaza. On the other hand, the Israeli blockade of Gaza was loosened, but the goods shipments, while up some 25 to 30 percent and including a mix of more items, never began to approach the pre-blockade levels. Hamas hoped that the accord would lead Israel to suspend attacks on the West Bank and Gaza. Israeli forces continued to attack Hamas and other militants in the West Bank, prompting the rogue Palestinian militants in Gaza to fire rockets. The Israeli military also found several dozen improvised explosive devices and sniper fire cases on the Gaza border. Israel in turn hoped that the accord would lead to progress on negotiations for the release of [[Gilad Shalit]]; neither hope was met.&lt;ref name=revive/&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' stated on 1 July that it was not clear how Hamas would know definitively whether a rocket was fired. Several militant factions operate inside Gaza. But Israel had taken a [[zero tolerance]] policy towards the truce in which every rocket and/or mortar attack would be punished in some way.&lt;ref name=USA/&gt;{{Disputed inline|Talk page section|date=July 2017}} On 11 August 2008 Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said that a military invasion of the Gaza Strip would not stop cross-border rocket attacks by Palestinian militants, but that the seven-week-old truce mediated by Egypt had halted the barrages for the first time in years. He said the numbers of short-range unguided rockets hitting Israel from Gaza had been reduced from hundreds to a handful. The same day a senior Hamas official said that the Islamic organization was not interested in renewing talks to free the abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit until Israel completely lifted the siege on Gaza.&lt;ref name=DivPal3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/A3DB135139D4C97D852574C8006C245C |title=Chronological Review of Events Relating to the Question of Palestine, August 2008 |author=Division for Palestinian Rights|publisher=UNISPAL|year=2008| accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli violations of the ceasefire prior to November 4, 2008===
[[Palestinian Center for Human Rights]] recorded several IDF violations in the early days of the lull.

On 19 June 2008, just a few hours after the beginning of the ceasefire Israeli forces opened fire against fishermen and farmers in Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;"IOF troops breach truce in Gaza Strip, shoot at Palestinian fishermen" Palestinian Information Center 20 June 2008 [http://www.palestine-info.co.uk/en/default.aspx?xyz=U6Qq7k%2bcOd87MDI46m9rUxJEpMO%2bi1s7ciPmZzO4AXIIgtY58Ua0zX7qTXjkqeWIPpEpPMxmREjVvakAsy9E%2bwAURSW4noW%2fuVrjfzkM1uV7PEPACUWmnbYxwOqorrVHeqaKPJknxEk%3d]&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak ordered the closure of all the crossings into the Gaza Strip. In response the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade fired a Qassam rocket at the western Negev the next day.

On 28 June IDF troops killed 7-year-old Mohamed Al Allami during a military operation in the village of Beit Omer, south of Hebron. Islamic Jihad fired a rocket or mortar shell into southern Israel, threatening to resume rocket attacks if Israel continued military operations in the West Bank.

On 29 June a Hamas official in charge of agriculture in the Gaza Strip Mohammad Ramadan Al-Agha said that the IDF was shooting at Gaza’s farmers whenever they went to their land near the borders.&lt;ref name=DivPal /&gt;

On 1 July a Palestinian woman was shot and wounded in the leg by the Israeli Army near the Sufa border crossing in the southern Gaza Strip while she was tending her sheep.

On 10 July Israeli troops killed an unarmed Palestinian near the border in the southern Gaza Strip, an IDF spokesman said. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed the victim had been one of its members. Palestinians fired two Qassam rockets into Israel’s western Negev region, hours after the killing. Hamas arrested three militants from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades immediately after they launched the rockets at targets in Israel.

On 14 July the PA Ministry of Agriculture said that 75 per cent of agricultural lands in the Gaza Strip had been razed by the IDF.

On 23 July the IDF shot and wounded a Palestinian in the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref name=DivPal2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/D33DD4A30C6FBE77852574C8006B6400 |title=Chronological Review of Events Relating to the Question of Palestine, July 2008|author=Division for Palestinian Rights|publisher=UNISPAL|year=2008| accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hamas' observance of the ceasefire prior to November 4, 2008===

Prior to the incident on November 4, in which Israeli forces destroyed a cross-border tunnel and killed six of its operatives, Hamas had been scrupulously adhering to the ceasefire - not firing rockets itself and reigning in other Palestinian groups.&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;{{cite book |last=Mason|first=Victoria|editor-last1=Poynting|editor-first1=Scott |editor-last2=Whyte|editor-first2=David|title=Counter-Terrorism and State Political Violence: The 'war on Terror' as Terror|chapter='No permission to shoot in Gaza is necessary': Israeli State terror against Palestinians in Gaza during Operation Cast Lead|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|pages=119–122 |isbn=978-0-415-60720-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas' adherence to the ceasefire was admitted by official Israeli spokesperson, Mark Regev.&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt; In an interview with David Fuller on More4 News (a sister programme of the U.K.'s Channel 4 News) on 9 January 2009, two weeks into Israel’s assault on Gaza, Regev explained that "“Success is freeing the civilian population of southern Israel from the fear of an incoming Hamas rockets.”&lt;ref name=Fuller&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.david-morrison.org.uk/palestine/israel-hamas-ceasefire.htm|title=How Israel torpedoed its ceasefire with Hamas to produce a casus belli|author=Morrison, David|year=2009| accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Fuller put it to Regev that “there were no Hamas rockets during the ceasefire before November the 4th, there were no Hamas rockets for 4 months”, Regev replied: “That’s correct”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video |title=Who Broke The Cease Fire - Hamas or Israel 2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SILJxPTqjAM |first=David |last=Fuller |publisher=More4 News|date=January 9, 2009|time=0:56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for Regev's view is found in a document provided to journalists, published by Israel's Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Centre: "Hamas was careful to maintain the ceasefire".&lt;ref name=ITIC2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/en/article/18366|title=The Six Months of the Lull Arrangement|publisher=The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Centre|date=December 19, 2008| accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Israel’s refusal to comply with the truce agreement to end the siege, Hamas brought rocket and mortar fire from Gaza to a virtual halt during the summer and fall of 2008. Hamas “tried to enforce the terms of the arrangement” on other Palestinian groups, taking “a number of steps against networks which violated the arrangement,” including short-term detention and confiscating their weapons, but it could not completely end the rocket and mortar shell attacks by these rogue factions in Gaza. Hamas had sought support in Gazan public opinion for its policy of maintaining the ceasefire.&lt;ref name=Porter&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/09/israel-rejected-hamas-cea_n_156639.html?show_comment_id=19558888|title=Israel Rejected Hamas Ceasefire Offer In December|author=Gareth Porter|publisher=Huffington Post|year=2009| accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ITIC2/&gt;

===Violations of the Hamas-Israel agreement by other Gaza organisations===
A week after the cease-fire agreement was reached, Hamas called on other Palestinian factions to abide by the truce. A rocket attack on Israel by [[al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]] was condemned by Hamas as "unpatriotic."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3561133,00.html Haniyeh: All Palestinian factions should honor truce].

[[Hamas]] believed that 19 June agreement required it to end rocket attacks upon [[Israel]] in exchange for an end of the blockade.&lt;ref name=revive/&gt; According to ''The New York Times'':
{{cquote|It took some days, but they were largely successful. Hamas imposed its will and even imprisoned some of those who were firing rockets. Israeli and United Nations figures show that while more than 300 rockets were fired into Israel in May, 10 to 20 were fired in July, depending on who was counting and whether mortar rounds were included. In August, 10 to 30 were fired, and in September, 5 to 10.&lt;ref name=revive/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

On 5 July Egyptian authorities found weapons and explosives in the Sinai desert they believe were destined for the Gaza Strip. On 8 July the IDF said Gaza militants fired a mortar shell into the western Negev in another violation of the truce. On 11 July Hamas arrested another four members of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in the village of Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip. On 12 and 13 July Gaza militants fired single rockets into Israel &lt;ref name=DivPal2 /&gt;

{{cquote|We recognize that until last week Hamas took efforts to halt rocket attacks by other groups as part of the 19 June ceasefire.

We also urge you to take all necessary measures to curb such unlawful attacks whether or not the current ceasefire remains in place or is extended beyond its 19 December deadline. Security forces under your control in Gaza have also demonstrated an ability to curb rocket fire. On at least two occasions, Hamas security personnel arrested people accused of firing rockets. On 10 July at least three members of the Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades were detained for firing rockets.

A group of Gaza militants, including Hamas' armed wing [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]],&lt;ref name=vague/&gt; captured Israeli Staff Sergeant Gilad Shalit in June 2006 and had held him as a [[hostage]] ever since, connecting his release to the Israel release of Palestinian prisoners.&lt;ref name=bid/&gt; Israel directly tied his release to the cease-fire.&lt;ref name=fragile/&gt; However, the issue was not mentioned in the initial cease-fire itself, which led Shalit's father and grandfather to attack the Israeli government.&lt;ref name=wash/&gt; In the early stage of the lull, Israeli officials had stated that they found “a certain sense of progress” on Shalit's release.&lt;ref name=implement/&gt; Hamas considered Shalit's status to be entirely separate from the cease-fire negotiations themselves.&lt;ref name=revive/&gt; It conditioned a deal about his release to the end of the Israeli blockade of Gaza.&lt;ref name=vague/&gt;

On 4 November 2008, the IDF made an incursion at least 250 meters into the Gaza Strip searching for a tunnel, claiming it was intended for the capture of Israeli soldiers and that it intended to continue with the truce, calling the raid a "pinpoint operation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/05/israelandthepalestinians|work=The Guardian |date=5 November 2008|first=Roy|last=McCarthy|title=Gaza truce broken as Israeli raid kills six Hamas gunmen|accessdate=6 June 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Robert Pastor, senior advisor to the Carter Center,  who met with Khaled Meshal, chairman of the Hamas political bureau in Damascus, Hamas asserted that the tunnel was being dug for defensive purposes, not to capture IDF personnel. Pastor said further that one IDF official confirmed that fact to him.&lt;ref name=Pastor&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/09/israel-rejected-hamas-cea_n_156639.html?show_comment_id=19558888|title=Gareth Porter, 'Israel Rejected Hamas Ceasefire Offer In December'|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date= 9 January 2009|accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As six Hamas fighters were killed,&lt;ref name=revive/&gt;&lt;ref name="hider"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article5089940.ece|work=The Times|accessdate=8 January 2009|date=6 November 2008|title=Six die in Israeli attack over Hamas 'tunnel under border to kidnap soldier'|author=Hider, James | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas stated that the attack was a "massive breach of the truce".&lt;ref name=Guardian20091105&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaza truce broken as Israeli raid kills six Hamas gunmen|work=The Guardian |author=Rory McCarthy|date=5 November 2008|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/05/israelandthepalestinians | location=London| accessdate=16 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090117092822/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/05/israelandthepalestinians| archivedate= 17 January 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Israeli military attack on Hamas in Gaza on November 4, Hamas resumed intensive rocket attacks on Israel.&lt;ref name="novattacks"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=July 13, 2017|date=August 6, 2009|title=Rockets from Gaza|work=Human Rights Watch|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2009/08/06/rockets-gaza/harm-civilians-palestinian-armed-groups-rocket-attacks |first=Bill|last=Van Esveld}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 17 November article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', "since violence flared on 5 Nov, Israeli forces and militants, some of them from Hamas, have engaged in almost daily tit-for-tat exchanges."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/3469836/Israel-decides-to-maintain-Gaza-blockade.html Israel decides to maintain Gaza blockade] ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''.

The reliability of the IDF allegation that the tunnel was intended to kidnap Israeli soldiers on the other side of the border has been challenged by various sources{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. A member of the Carter Centre, involved in negotiations at the time with both Hamas and Israel, reported that Hamas had claimed that the tunnel was defensive against IDF shelling, with an anonymous IDF officer confirming that fact.&lt;ref name=Pastor /&gt;

Likud MK Yuval Steinitz acknowledged in an al-Jazeera interview on January 4, 2009 that Israel began actively preparing for Operation Cast Lead months beforehand, around June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Institute for Palestine Studies|year=2009|title=Israeli Military Operations against Gaza, 2000–2008|journal=Institute for Palestine Studies|volume=38 |issue= Spring|pages=122–138|url=http://www.palestine-studies.org/sites/default/files/uploads/files/Israeli%20Military%20Attacks%20on%20Gaza%202009.pdf|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

On 13 December 2008, Israel announced that it was in favor of extending the cease-fire, provided Hamas adhered to its conditions.&lt;ref name=sofer&gt;{{Cite news | last = Sofer | first = Roni | title = Israel in favor of extending Gaza lull | work=Ynetnews | accessdate=27 December 2008 | date = 13 December 2008 | url = http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3637877,00.html| archive-url = https://archive.is/20081230145625/http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3637877,00.html| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 30 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions posed by a Hamas delegation in Cairo on 14 December, were that the parties return to the original Hamas-Israel ceasefire arrangement. Hamas would undertake to stop all rocket attacks against Israel if the Israelis would agree to open up the border crossings, not to reduce commercial traffic thereafter, and not to launch attacks in Gaza. At an Israeli Cabinet meeting on 21 December, [[Yuval Diskin]], head of [[Shin Bet|Israel's internal security agency]], said he thought Hamas was "interested in continuing the truce, but wants to improve its terms... It wants us to lift the siege [of Gaza], stop attacks, and extend the truce to include [the West Bank]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7794577.stm|title=Israeli leaders 'to topple Hamas'|date=22 December 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090111102212/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7794577.stm| archivedate= 11 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December, Hamas officially announced that they would not be extending the cease-fire, which had expired on 19 December, citing Israeli border closures as the primary reason, and resumed its shelling of the western [[Negev]]. Hamas continued to offer a re-establishment of the cease-fire, given the Israeli government would accept its terms. The terms were defined as the lifting of the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade]] and a complete ban of military incursions into Gaza. At that time, Hamas also refused European mediation of the talks to release Gilad Shalit, citing Israel's unwillingness to cooperate on a cease-fire agreement.&lt;ref name=harel&gt;{{Cite news | last = Harel | first = Amos |author2=Avi Issacharoff  |author3=Barak Ravid  | title = Hamas declares end to cease-fire, Israeli gov't sources fear violence is unavoidable | work=Haaretz | accessdate=27 December 2008 | date = 21 December 2008 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1048055.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081220235316/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1048055.html| archivedate= 20 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Abington School District v. Schempp''''', 374 U.S. 203 (1963),&lt;ref name="Abington"&gt;{{ussc|name=Abington School District v. Schempp|volume=374|page=203|pin=|year=1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court decided 8–1 in favor of the respondent, Edward Schempp, and declared school-sponsored Bible reading in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] in the United States to be [[unconstitutional]]. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court during this case was [[Earl Warren]].

== Background ==

===Origin of case===
The ''Abington'' case began when Edward Schempp, a [[Unitarian Universalist]] and a resident of [[Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Abington Township, Pennsylvania]], filed suit against the [[Abington School District]] in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]] to prohibit the enforcement of a [[Pennsylvania]] state law that required his children, specifically [[Ellery Schempp]], to hear and sometimes read portions of the Bible as part  of their [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] education.&lt;ref&gt;Dierenfield, Bruce J. "The Most Hated Woman in America: Madalyn Murray and the Crusade Against School Prayer"], ''Journal of Supreme Court History'' 32, no.1 (2007), 62-84&lt;/ref&gt; That law (24 Pa. Stat. 15-1516, as amended, Pub. Law 1928) required that "[a]t least ten verses from the Holy Bible [be] read, without comment, at the opening of each public school on each school day." Schempp specifically contended that the statute violated his and his family's rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.&lt;ref name="Abington"/&gt;

Pennsylvania law, like that of four other states, included a statute compelling school districts to perform Bible readings in the mornings before classes. Twenty-five states had laws allowing "optional" Bible reading, with the remainder having no laws supporting or rejecting Bible reading. In eleven of those states with laws supportive of Bible reading or state-sponsored prayer, the state courts had declared them unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boston|1993|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related case was that brought by [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]], mother of plaintiff [[William J. Murray|William J. Murray III]] (b. 1946), who filed suit against the local school system in ''Murray v. Curlett'' to prohibit compulsory prayer and Bible reading in public schools. In 1963 she founded the group [[American Atheists]] (originally known as the Society of Separationists).  The Murray case was consolidated with Schempp's on appeal to the Supreme Court.

=== District court arguments ===
During the first trial in federal [[United States district court|district court]], Edward Schempp and his children testified as to specific religious doctrines purveyed by a literal reading of the Bible "which were contrary to the religious beliefs which they held and to their familial teaching" (177 F. Supp. 398, 400). The children testified that all of the doctrines to which they referred were read to them at various times as part of the exercises. Edward Schempp testified at the second trial that he had considered having his children excused from attendance at the exercises but decided against it for several reasons, including his belief that the children's relationships with their teachers and classmates would be adversely affected.

=== District court ruling ===
The district court ruled in Schempp's favor, and struck down the Pennsylvania statute. The school district appealed the ruling, and while that appeal was pending, the Pennsylvania legislature amended the statute to allow children to be excused from the exercises upon the written request of their parents&lt;!-- (described on p. 227, Footnote 1) --&gt;. This change did not satisfy Schempp, however, and he continued his action against the school district, charging that the amendment of the law did not change its nature as an unconstitutional establishment of religion. Because of the change in the law, the Supreme Court had responded to the school district's appeal by vacating the first ruling and remanding the case to the district court. &lt;!-- According to Footnote 1, the events were as follows: 1) the district court found the un-amended law unconstitutional at the 1st trial, 2) the school district appealed, 3) the legislature amended the statute, 4) the S.C. vacated the judgment and remanded it (sent it back to the district court, 5) the school district successfully moved to amend their original stance to reflect the change in the law, 6) the district court found for Schempp, and 7) the school district appealed the ruling.--&gt; The district court again found for Schempp. The school district [[appeal]]ed to the Supreme Court again, and, on appeal, the case was consolidated with a similar [[Maryland]] case launched by O'Hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boston|1993|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district court ruling in the second trial, in striking down the practices and the statute requiring them, made specific findings of fact that the children's attendance at Abington Senior High School was compulsory and that the practice of reading 10 verses from the Bible was also compelled by law. It also found that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reading of the verses, even without comment, possesses a devotional and religious character and constitutes in effect a religious observance. The devotional and religious nature of the morning exercises is made all the more apparent by the fact that the Bible reading is followed immediately by a recital in unison by the pupils of the [[Lord's Prayer]]. The fact that some pupils, or theoretically all pupils, might be excused from attendance at the exercises does not mitigate the obligatory nature of the ceremony for ... Section 1516 ... unequivocally requires the exercises to be held every school day in every school in the Commonwealth. The exercises are held in the school buildings and perforce are conducted by and under the authority of the local school authorities and during school sessions. Since the statute requires the reading of the 'Holy Bible,' a Christian document, the practice ... prefers the Christian religion. The record demonstrates that it was the intention of ... the Commonwealth ... to introduce a religious ceremony into the public schools of the Commonwealth. (201 F. Supp., at 819; quoted in {{ussc|374|203|1963}})&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Precedents for case ===
The Court explicitly upheld ''[[Engel v. Vitale]],'' in which  the Court ruled that the sanctioning of a prayer by the school amounted to a violation of the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], which states, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." The ''Abington'' court held that in organizing a reading of the Bible, the school was conducting "a religious exercise," and "that cannot be done without violating the 'neutrality' required of the State by the balance of power between individual, church and state that has been struck by the First Amendment" ({{ussc|374|203|1963}}).
&lt;!-- Might be appropriate someplace else in the article:
The decision in ''Abington'' led the way for future Establishment Clause rulings, leading up to ''Lemon v. Kurtzman,'' which established the three-prong "Lemon test" for determining whether federal or state legislation violates the Establishment Clause.
--&gt;
Over the previous two decades, the Supreme Court, by [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporating]] specific rights into the [[Due process|Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], had steadily increased the extent to which rights contained in [[United States Bill of Rights]] were applied against the states.{{efn|The process of [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation]] (also known as "nationalization") of the United States Bill of Rights began with cases {{ussc|name=Missouri Pacific Railway Co. v. State of Nebraska Board of Transportation|volume=164|page=403|pin=|year=1896}} and {{ussc|name=Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co. v. City of Chicago|volume=166|page=226|pin=|year=1897}} pitting the [[railroads]] against the government over just compensation for the taking of private property, due all persons (and corporations) under the Fifth Amendment. Next was First Amendment Freedom of Speech, in {{ussc|name=Fiske v. Kansas|link=|volume=274|page=380|pin=|year=1927}}. Freedom of Religion was first incorporated (albeit in dictum) in {{ussc|name=Hamilton v. Regents of the University of California|volume=293|page=245|pin=|year=1934}}, and made official in {{ussc|name=Cantwell v. Connecticut|link=|volume=310|page=296|pin=|year=1940}}. Finally in {{ussc|name=Engel v. Vitale|volume=370|page=421|pin=|year=1962}}, the court ruled that a state could not write or sanction an official prayer to be read by students at school. For a more detailed history of Incorporation, see [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)]].}} ''Abington'' was a continuation of this trend with regard to the Establishment of Religion Clause of the First Amendment, and specifically built upon Supreme Court precedents in {{ussc|name=Cantwell v. Connecticut|volume=310|page=296|pin=|year=1940}}, {{ussc|name=Everson v. Board of Education|volume=330|page=1|pin=|year=1947}}, and {{ussc|name=McCollum v. Board of Education|volume=333|page=203|pin=|year=1948}}.

== Opinions of the Court ==
The Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] in order to settle the persistent and vigorous protests resulting from its previous decision in ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' regarding religion in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|Zimmerman|1990|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry W. Sawyer]] argued the case for Schempp.
&lt;!--
=== Oral arguments ===
This section needs work...
--&gt;

=== Decision ===
The Supreme Court upheld the District Court's decision and found the Pennsylvania prayer statute unconstitutional by virtue of the facts in the case, as well as the clear line of precedent established by the Supreme Court. In writing the opinion of the Court, Justice Tom C. Clark stated, "This Court has decisively settled that the First Amendment's mandate [in the [[Establishment Clause]]&amp;#93; has been made wholly applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment ... in a series of cases since ''Cantwell''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eastland|1993|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|1991|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What was unexpected, however, were the ideas expressed in the second portion of Justice Clark's opinion written for the majority. The Court's recognition of religious ideals as valuable to the culture of the United States in that opinion are generally not cited much by either side of the church-state debate when discussing the case and the effect it had on the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} His opening thoughts explicitly spelled out that view in past [[jurisprudence]] with cases similar to ''Abington v. Schempp.''

Clark continued that the Court was of the feeling that no matter the religious nature of the citizenry, the government at all levels, as required by the Constitution, must remain neutral in matters of religion "while protecting all, prefer[ring] none, and disparag[ing] none."&lt;!-- (p.  [31]--&gt; The Court had clearly rejected "the contention by many that the Establishment Clause forbade only governmental preference of one faith over another."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eastland|1993|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing Justice [[Hugo Black]] in ''[[Torcaso v. Watkins]]'', Justice Clark added, "We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally force a person 'to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion.' Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against non-believers, and neither can aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs."&lt;!-- (p. 220) [33]--&gt; Such prohibited behavior was self-evident in the Pennsylvania law requiring Bible reading (and allowing recitation of the Lord's Prayer) in its public schools. The Court recognized the value of such ideal neutrality from lessons of history when government and religion were either fully fused or cooperative with one another and religious liberty was nonexistent or seriously curtailed&lt;!-- (p. 220, 222) [34]--&gt;.

=== Brennan's concurrence ===
[[William J. Brennan|Justice Brennan]] filed a lengthy and historically significant concurrence, taking seventy-three pages to elaborate his ideas about what the Framers intended in the formation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, gauging the value of religion in American culture, reviewing legal [[precedents]], and suggesting a course for future church-state cases. Brennan focused on the history of the Establishment Clause to counter numerous critics of the Court's Engel decision, who pointed out that prayer in public schools, as well as in many other areas of public life, was a longstanding practice going back to the framing of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. He professed to be aware of the "ambiguities in the historical record",&lt;ref&gt;Quoting author in {{harvnb|Davis|1991|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and felt a modern-day interpretation of the First Amendment was warranted. In defense of that approach, Brennan stated:

{{quote|1=Whatever [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] or [[James Madison|Madison]] would have thought of Bible reading or the recital of the Lord's Prayer in ... public schools ..., our use of the history ... must limit itself to broad purposes, not specific practices. ... [T]he Baltimore and Abington schools offend the First Amendment because they sufficiently threaten in our day those substantive evils the fear of which called forth the Establishment Clause. ... [O]ur interpretation of the First Amendment must necessarily be responsive to the much more highly charged nature of religious questions in contemporary society. A too literal quest for the advice of the Founding Fathers upon the issues of these cases seems to me futile and misdirected.}}

In answer to critics of a broad interpretation of the prohibitions against government in the realm of religion, Brennan said, "nothing in the text of the Establishment Clause supports the view that the prevention of the setting up of an official church was meant to be the full extent of the prohibitions against official involvements in religion"&lt;!-- (p. 233) [38]--&gt;.

In the third section of his exhaustive concurrence, Justice Brennan charted the course that led to the incorporation of the First Amendment's religion clauses by way of answering the charge of Abington Township's counsel that Pennsylvania's Bible reading statute was a state issue, outside the purview of the federal court system, including that of the Supreme Court&lt;!-- (p. 253–256) [38]--&gt;. He labeled the daily recitals of the Lord's Prayer and reading of the Bible as "quite [clear] breaches of the command of the Establishment Clause"&lt;!-- (p. 267) [40]--&gt;. He noted the long history of such practices, even before the "founding of our Republic"&lt;!-- (p. 268) --&gt;. Additionally, he stated that most of those who demanded reading of the Bible and prayer in schools were hoping to serve "broader goals than compelling formal worship of God or fostering church attendance"&lt;!-- (p. 271) [41]--&gt;. He cited the 1858 words of the Wisconsin Superintendent of Public Instruction, who saw the Bible as aptly suited to "teaching the noblest principles of virtue, morality, patriotism, and good order"&lt;!-- (p. 271) [41]--&gt;.

Justice Brennan took great pains to also show that many states, such as [[South Dakota]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Ohio]] and [[Massachusetts]], had already enacted and revoked laws similar to Pennsylvania's by the first half of the 20th century. In addition, many political leaders including attorneys general and presidents like [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] insisted that "matters of religion be left to family altars, churches and private schools" and "[It] is not our business to have the Protestant Bible or the Catholic Vulgate or the Talmud read in [public] schools"&lt;!-- (p. 273) [42]--&gt; .

Brennan's concurrence also recognized the plurality of religious thought in the nation as basis enough for restriction of church and state relations. He cited this lack of appreciation of that [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]] as the "basic flaw" of Pennsylvania's Bible reading statute and Abington Township's defense of it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are persons in every community—often deeply devout—to whom any version of the Judaeo-Christian Bible is offensive. There are others whose reverence for the Holy Scriptures demands private study or reflection and to whom public reading or recitation is sacrilegious.... To such persons it is not the fact of using the Bible in the public schools, nor the content of any particular version, that is offensive, but the manner in which it is used&lt;!-- (p. 284–285) [44]--&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Stewart's dissent ===
Justice [[Potter Stewart]] filed the only dissent in the case. In it, he was critical of both the [[lower court]] opinions and the decision the Supreme Court had reached regarding them. He wished to remand the case to lower courts for further proceedings.

Stewart had dissented in ''Engel v. Vitale'' and viewed the doctrine relied on in that case as implausible, given the long history of government religious practice in the United States, including the fact that the Supreme Court opens its own sessions with the declaration, "God Save this Honorable Court" and that Congress opens its sessions with prayers, among many other examples. Stewart believed that such practice fit with the nation's long history of permitting free exercise of religious practices, even in the public sphere.

He declared the cases consolidated with Schempp as "so fundamentally deficient as to make impossible an informed or responsible determination of the constitutional issues presented"—specifically, of whether the Establishment Clause was violated. As to the intent and scope of the religion clauses of the First Amendment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is, I think, a fallacious oversimplification to regard the [religion clauses] as establishing a single constitutional standard of "separation of church and state", which can be applied in every case to delineate the required boundaries between government and religion.... As a matter of history, the First Amendment was adopted solely as a limitation upon the newly created National Government. The events leading to its adoption strongly suggest that the Establishment Clause was primarily an attempt to insure that Congress not only would be powerless to establish a national church, but would also be unable to interfere with existing state establishments. ... So matters stood until the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, or more accurately, until this Court's decision in ''Cantwell''....&lt;!-- (pp. 308–309) [47].--&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He stated his agreement with the doctrine of the Fourteenth Amendment's embrace and application of the Bill of Rights, but pointed out the irony of such an amendment "designed to leave the States free to go their own way should now have become a restriction upon their autonomy".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{harvnb|Eastland|1993|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- [48]--&gt;

Other critics of the Court's findings in ''Abington v. Schempp'' often quote the following excerpt from Justice Stewart's opinion:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;!-- [49]--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If religious exercises are held to be an impermissible activity in schools, religion is placed in an artificial and state-created disadvantage.... And a refusal to permit religious exercises thus is seen, not as the realization of state neutrality, but rather as the establishment of a religion of secularism, or at least, as governmental support of the beliefs of those who think that religious exercises should be conducted only in private.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Subsequent developments ==
The public was divided in reaction to the Court's decision; the decision has sparked persistent and ongoing criticism from proponents of prayer in school. In 1964, ''Life'' magazine declared [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]], the mother of the plaintiff in one of the associated cases, to be "the most hated woman in America."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Madalyn Murray O'Hair Biography |url=http://www.who2.com/bio/madalyn-murray-ohair |accessdate=2013-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Newspaper]]s were no exception. The ''[[Washington Evening Star]]'', for example, criticized the decision, declaring that "God and religion have all but been driven from the public schools. What remains? Will the [[baccalaureate service]] and [[Christmas carol]]s be the next to go? Don't bet against it."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eastland|1993|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- [50]--&gt; In contrast, the ''New York Times'' was more accepting of the Court's ruling. The paper printed significant portions of the opinions with no significant comments, either supportive or critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1963|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents characterized the decision as the one which "kicked God and prayer out of the schools".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2008|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The views of various religious entities on the decision split between mainline Protestants and Jews, who in general strongly supported the decision, and evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics, who strongly opposed the decision. Speaking from the conservative [[Protestant]] perspective, the [[Reverend]] Dr. [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]] said, "[i]n my opinion ... the Supreme Court ... is wrong. ... Eighty percent of the American people want Bible reading and prayer in the schools. Why should a majority be so severely penalized ...?"&lt;ref&gt;''Billy Graham voices shock over decision''. (June 18, 1963). ''New York Times''. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The mainline denominations, with the exception of the Roman Catholic Church, expressed less critical opinions of the verdict. Some considered it to support religious freedom because it limited governmental authority in the sphere of public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dugan|1963|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Congress reacted by drafting more than 150 resolutions to overturn the ruling by a constitutional amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Hair|1974|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Abington v. Schempp'' was used as precedent for similar cases such as ''[[Board of Education v. Allen]]'' and ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' in the decades that followed. The three-part Lemon test had its basis in the jurisprudence of ''Abington v. Schempp''. Under the test, the constitutionality of a given church-state law is weighed by three criteria: whether a law has a non-secular purpose, advances or inhibits religion, or results in excessive government entanglement with religion.

'''Attachment of earnings''' is a [[legal process]] in [[civil litigation]] by which a [[defendant]]'s wages or other earnings are taken to pay for a [[debt]].  This collections process is used in the [[common law]] system, especially [[U.K.|Britain]] and the [[United States]], but in other legal regimes as well.&lt;ref&gt;Some cites are needed for other countries, esp. India, Africa&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Ballentine's Law Dictionary]]'' notes that this process is not literal, whereby a "person's property is figuratively brought into the court."&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine's Law Dictionary, at p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[earnings]] seized may be [[wages]], certain benefits, or [[sales]] commissions. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

A [[sheriff]], [[constable]], or [[Marshal#Law enforcement|marshall]] enforces the court order. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==United Kingdom==
In [[England]], an attachment of earning order can stop money being paid to a defendant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/infoabout/enforcement/ae/index.htm See the British government web site regarding this]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under English law, a self-employed, unemployed, or member of the armed forces can '''not''' have an attachment against them.
 
In England, the District Council can attach earnings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eden.gov.uk/main.asp?page=369 See the Eden Council web page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927101929/http://www.eden.gov.uk/main.asp?page=369 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be by a physical removal of the money or other personal property.  However, more commonly, the officer merely contacts the [[bank]], [[landlord]], [[employer]], [[trustee]], [[bailment|bailee]] or other person holding the property, with a [[certified copy]] of the order, for them to hand over the debtor's property for attachment; this is especially true with intangible personal property and [[real property]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==United States==
At present four U.S. states — North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Texas — do not allow wage garnishment at all except for debts related to taxes, child support, federally guaranteed student loans, and court-ordered fines or restitution for a crime the debtor committed.  Several other states observe maximum thresholds that are lower than the 25 percent maximum provided by federal law.  States may also prohibit garnishment altogether in certain circumstances. For example, in Florida the wages of a person who provides more than half the support for a child or other dependent are exempt from garnishment altogether (though this exemption is subject to waiver).

In New York, a limit of 10 percent of gross earnings may be taken for ordinary debts.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., N.Y. CPLR section 5205; also, see 11 U.S.C.A. Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, 15 percent may be taken for student loans, {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} and up to 40 percent for [[child support]] arrears,&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. CPLR sections 5241, 5241&lt;/ref&gt; or even higher. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

In many [[United States|American]] jurisdictions, attachment of earnings is treated the same as, or is just called, [[garnishment]].  This is when either earnings, and/or [[property]] may be taken by the court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1648">'''Change of position''' is a defence to a claim in [[unjust enrichment]] which operates to reduce a defendant's liability to the extent to which his or her circumstances have changed as a consequence of an enrichment.

== History ==
The historical core of the law of unjust enrichment consists of the [[quasi-contract]]ual actions of [[money had and received]], money paid to the defendant's use, [[quantum meruit]] and quantum valebat. These personal [[common law]] actions generated an obligation on the part of the defendant to give [[restitution]] of a gain acquired at the expense of the plaintiff. This liability was [[Strict liability|strict]] and independent of any wrongdoing on the part of the recipient. Change of position provides a defence to a defendant where it would be inequitable to compel him or her to make restitution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6622">'''Co-belligerence''' is the waging of a [[war]] in cooperation against a common enemy with or without a formal treaty of [[military alliance]]. Generally, the term is used for cases where no alliance exists. Co-belligerents are defined in the ''Encyclopaedic Dictionary of International Law'' as "states engaged in a conflict with a common enemy, whether in alliance with each other or not".&lt;ref&gt;"Co-belligerent(s)", in John P. Grant and J. Craig Barker, eds., ''Encyclopaedic Dictionary of International Law'', 3 ed. (Oxford University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Allies may not become co-belligerents if a ''[[casus foederis]]'' invoking the alliance has not arisen.

==Historical examples==

===The Allies as co-belligerents with former enemies===
The term was used in 1943–45 during the latter stages of [[World War II]] to define the status of former [[Germany|German]] allies and associates (chiefly [[Italy]], but also from 1944 [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Hungary]] and [[Finland]]), after they joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war against Germany.

===Finland as co-belligerent with Germany in World War II===
Co-belligerence is also the term used by [[Finland]] for her military co-operation with [[Germany]] during the Second World War. Between 1941 and 1944, during what the Finns called the [[Continuation War]], both countries had the [[Soviet Union]] as a common enemy. Finnish reentry into World War II was a direct consequence of Germany's attack on the Soviet Union, [[Operation Barbarossa]].

While the [[Allied powers of World War II|Allied states]] often referred to Finland as one of the [[Axis Power]]s, Finland was never a signatory to the German-Italian-Japanese [[Tripartite Pact]] of September 1940. The Allies, in turn, pointed to the fact that Finland, like Japan and Italy, as well as a number of countries including neutral Spain, belonged to Hitler's [[Anti-Comintern Pact]].

[[Adolf Hitler]] declared Germany to be ''im Bunde'' (in league) with the Finns, but Finland's government declared their intention to remain first a [[non-belligerent]] country, then co-belligerent after the Soviets started bombing Finnish cities all over the country, not the least due to a remaining [[neutralist]] public opinion. The truth was somewhere in-between:
# By mining the [[Gulf of Finland]] Finland's navy together with the [[Kriegsmarine]] before the start of Barbarossa locked the Leningrad fleet in, making the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] practically domestic German waters, where submarines and navy could be trained without risks in addition to securing Finland's fundamental trade routes for food and fuel.
# Germany was allowed to recruit a [[Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS]] which served under direct German command in operations away from Finnish-Soviet border. (It also recruited from [[non-belligerent]] Sweden and Spain. Germany did not recruit from countries formally allied with it until 1943, when Italy surrendered)&lt;ref name="Jokipii"&gt;[[Mauno Jokipii]], ''Hitlerin Saksa ja sen vapaaehtoisliikkeet'', Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura, 2002, {{ISBN|951-746-335-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The initial Finnish offensive was co-ordinated with [[Operation Barbarossa]] (see [[Continuation War]] for details of the pre-offensive staff talks).
# Finnish invasion of the [[Karelian Isthmus]] (historically former territory), and to a lesser extent the occupation of [[East Karelia]] contributed to the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. Finland also helped to block Soviet supply deliveries into the city and hosted, supplied and participated within the [[Naval Detachment K|Lake Ladoga Flotilla]] which aimed to disrupt Soviet supply delivery.
# A German army corps invaded the Soviet Union from Finnish Lapland, and German army and air force units reinforced the Finnish army during the decisive 1944 battles on the Karelian isthmus. Finland and Germany executed several joint German-Finnish Operations at the Finnish front. The Finnish invasion far exceeded the territory of pre [[Winter War]] Finland. Finland occupied as far as [[Lake Onega]] and Finnish troops even crossed the [[River Svir]] for a possible link-up with German troops.
# Great Britain declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941.
# Germany supplied Finland with military equipment of all kinds, ranging from weapons, uniforms and helmets to tanks and assault guns. Finland in exchange delivered rare resources like nickel.
# Finland also extradited eight [[Jew]]s (on orders from the then head of the State Police [[Arno Anthoni]] who was deeply anti-semitic – [[Finnish prime minister]] [[Paavo Lipponen]] issued an official apology for deportations in 2000), 76 political prisoners with non-Finnish citizenship and 2,600–2,800 prisoners of war to Germany in exchange for 2,100 [[Finnic peoples|Fennic]]/[[Karelians|Karelian]] prisoners of war from Germany. Some of the extradited had Finnish nationality, but had moved to Soviet Union before the war, received Soviet citizenship and returned to Finland in secret.
# Jews were not discriminated against. A number of them served in the Finnish Army (204 during the [[Winter War]], and about 300 during the [[Continuation War]]){{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. When [[Himmler]] tried to persuade Finnish leaders to deport the Jews to [[Nazi concentration camps]], [[Marshal Mannerheim]] is said to have replied: "While Jews serve in my army I will not allow their deportation"{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. [[Yad Vashem]] records that 22 [[Finnish Jews]] died in the [[Holocaust]], all fighting for the [[Finnish Army]]. Two Jewish officers of the Finnish army and one female [[Lotta Svärd]] member were awarded the German [[Iron Cross]], but they refused to accept them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reime|first1=Hannu|title=Un-Finnish Business|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/un-finnish-business-1.317886|accessdate=30 August 2017|work=Haaretz|date=8 October 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3632">'''Contract city''' is a term used in some [[U.S. state]]s for a city that contracts one or more municipal services to another unit of government, or to a private or commercial organization.  Most of the contracts are for police or fire / rescue / paramedic services to the county in which the city lies.

In the traditional method, ''franchising'', a private company has a [[government-granted monopoly|franchise]], or legal right, to perform certain public services normally done by municipal government. Cities of all kinds have entered into contracts for non-core governmental services, such as facilities and grounds maintenance, auditing, legal counsel, road construction, garbage collection, water and waste water treatment, engineering services, animal control, and others. Such cities rely on the private sector to provide public service delivery, while the public sector maintains oversight. Public officials are specifically responsible for writing, signing, managing and enforcing contracts.

Another method of contracting is for the city to contract with its county government or with neighboring cities to provide municipal services such as police and public safety, libraries, or parks and recreation. 

In contrast, independent cities are cities which provide basic governmental services themselves, without contracting (this usage is not to be confused with the more common usage of [[independent city]] as a city that is not part of any [[County (United States)|county]]). Most older cities are independent cities. In practice, many cities are hybrids of both. For instance, they may directly operate parks programs, but contract with the county for police and fire services. Most contract cities do their own [[land use planning]], since cities were incorporated to exert local control over land use.

==History==
In 1954, [[Lakewood, California]], became the first city to contract with its county for public services. The previously [[unincorporated area]] was facing a hostile annexation from adjacent [[Long Beach, California]], and residents favored retaining local control while maintaining the existing services provided by [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]. The so-called Lakewood Plan has been the model for most new contract cities incorporated since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasdhq.org/lasd_services/contract_law/index.html |title=Welcome to contract law enforcement |work=Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department |accessdate=28 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304185244/http://www.lasdhq.org/lasd_services/contract_law/index.html |archivedate=4 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of contract cities. Several that have received attention from the media include:

The '''[[Jordan]]ian Copyright Law''' and its Amendment No. (22) for the year 1992 is based on the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] and does not contain a definition of [[copyright]]; however in Article (3) it clearly states that the law offers legal protection to any kind of original work in literature, art and science regardless of the value or purpose of the work.

== Copyright registration ==

In Jordan copyright automatically attaches upon the creation of an original work of authorship, however registration / deposit with the [[National Library of Jordan|National Library]] of the [[Jordanian Ministry of Culture]] puts a [[copyright holder]] in a better position if litigation arises over the copyright.

A copyright holder desiring to register his/her copyright should:

# Obtain and complete the appropriate form(s).
# Prepare clear renditions of material being submitted for copyright.
# If relevant, obtain any necessary forfeit documents from persons who contributed to the work.
# Deposit the work at the National Library.

Each work is issued a depository number, and no official fees are required.

(See Jordanian Copyright Law and Regulation)

== Copyright duration ==

Copyright protection begins when a work is actually created and fixed in a tangible form. For the majority of cases the duration of a copyright is for the life of the copyright owner plus fifty years following his/her death. There are two categories of exceptions to the standard duration of life plus fifty years, however.

# The author of a work only enjoys copyright protection for fifty years from the date the work was created in the following circumstances
#* the author or rightsholder is a corporation, or other type of [[Juristic person|legal entity]] that grants some of the same rights as those that apply to [[natural person]]s
#* the work is a cinema or television production
#* the work is published for the first time after the death of the author
#* the work is published under a pseudonym. In this case, if the work's author reveals his/her identity within the protection period then the copyright duration is extended until 50 years following the author's death.
# Photographs and applied arts enjoy only a 25-year protection period, commencing on January 1 of their creation year.

When the protection period expires the work enters into the public domain, making it legal for all to use.

(see Articles 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34 of the Jordanian Copyright Law No. 22 for the year 1992 and its amendments)

== Copyright holder ==

An author or creator is the ''copyright holder'' for any work they publish that is attributed to them, whether or not copyright is clearly stated in the work or by any other means. If an employee creates, during employment, a work related to the activities or business of the employer, or by using the material placed under their disposal to arrive at the work, then the copyright shall be that of the employer unless agreed otherwise in writing.

(see Article 6 of the Jordanian Copyright Law)

== Copyright exceptions ==

Works that have entered into the public domain have no copyright protection. Also some works have what is referred to as a ''copylife license'', meaning that the author has granted everyone permission to freely use and improve upon the work.

Also if the exploitation of the work is for educational purposes or for personal use, then in such cases the use of the work will be legal and therefore not qualified as an infringement.

Laws, regulations and court judgments, news items and reports do not carry a copyright. The Minister of Culture holds the copyright for works that fall into the category of national heritage and is charged with preventing misuse of such works while at the same time allowing public access to those works.

== Rights Associated with Copyright ==
{{Expert-subject|Law|section|date=November 2008}}

The rights that attach to copyright can be classified into economic rights and moral rights. Moral rights can not be sold or surrendered and require that the work be attributed to its author. In contrast, economic rights may be assigned by the author as they wish provided the assignment is in writing and unequivocally states the right at issue, its scope, purpose, place and term. (see Article 13 of the Jordanian Copyright Law)

Conversely, the law nullified any action taken by the author/copyright holder in their collective future thought product.(see Article 14 of the Jordanian Copyright Law)

A copyright holder's [[exclusive rights]] grant the holder the freedom to exercise the rights associated with copyright, and require others to obtain the consent of the copyright holder before exercising those rights.

Several exclusive rights attach to the copyright holder, including

* the right to publish and produce copies or reproductions of the work and to sell those copies (including electronic copies)
* the right to make amendments to the work (to improve or change the work)
* the right to create derivative works (works that adapt the original work)
* the right to perform or display the work publicly
* the right to sell or assign these rights to others
* the right to withdraw the work from circulation
* the right to challenge any infringement of the work

(see Article 8 of the Jordanian Copyright Law No.22 for the year 1992 and its amendments)

An [[Copyright infringement|infringement]] on a copyright typically occurs when one or more of the copyright holder’s rights are utilized by others without the authorization of the copyright holder.

== Compulsory licensing ==
{{Expert-subject|Law|section|date=November 2008}}

The Jordanian Minister of Culture has the right to assign a nonexclusive, non-assignable license to Jordanian nationals for either of two purposes:

# translation and publication of a foreign work to the Arabic language, provided that no such translation was made by the author within three years form the work's initial publication
# publication of a work for sale at a lower or equal price as similar works offered for sale in Jordan

[[Compulsory licensing]] is only granted for uses tied to education, and in all cases the author of the original work remains entitled to [[just compensation]].

(see Article 11 of the Jordanian Copyright Law No. 22 for the year 1992)

== Copyright protection ==

Authors/copyright holders whose copyrights have been infringed have the right to receive just compensation. When determining such compensation the courts take a number of elements into account such as the author’s cultural standing, the value of the work as such, the value of the work in the market place and the extent to which the infringing party has profited from the exploitation of the work.

In addition the author (or the heirs or legal successors) may request that the courts take measures to:

* halt the infringement
* confiscate the infringing work, its reproductions, copies or any other material used in the reproduction
* destroy the work’s reproductions or copies.
* confiscate the revenues resulting from the copyright infringement

In instances of counterfeiting or the utilization of an author’s exclusive right without authorization, the infringing party may be subject to criminal penalties in the form of imprisonment for a period not less than three months and not more than three years and a fine not less than one thousand Jordanian [[Dinars]] and not more than three thousand Jordanian Dinars.

A '''dead man's statute''', also known as a '''dead man act''' or '''dead man's rule''', is a statute designed to prevent [[perjury]] in a [[civil case]] by prohibiting a [[witness]] who is an interested party from [[testimony|testifying]] about communications or transactions with a deceased person (a "decedent") against the decedent unless there is a [[waiver]].

This prohibition applies only against a witness who has an interest in the outcome of the case and applies only where that witness is testifying for his own interests and against the interests of the decedent. Furthermore, the restriction only exists in civil cases, never in [[Criminal law|criminal]] cases.

The restriction can be waived. A waiver can occur in a number of ways: 
#The decedent's representative fails to object to the testimony;
#The decedent's own representative testifies to the communication;
#The decedent's testimony is brought before the jury in the form of a deposition or in another form.

With respect to U.S. federal courts, Rule 601 of the Federal Rules of Evidence defers to state law the determination of whether a witness is competent to testify. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_601 Federal Rules of Evidence. Rule 601. Competency to Testify in General.] Every person is competent to be a witness unless these rules provide otherwise. But in a civil case, state law governs the witness’s competency regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision. (Pub. L. 93–595, §1, Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1934; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of the [[U.S. State]]s have enacted a dead man statute, more commonly referred to as the "dead man's rule." Some states have enacted compromise variations to the rule. For example, in [[Virginia]], an interested witness may testify only as to the statements of the deceased if this testimony is corroborated by a disinterested witness. In other states, such as [[Illinois]], the rule has been expanded to prevent an interested party from testifying about communications with a minor or a legally incompetent person.

The Texas dead man's rule, found at Texas Rules of Evidence, 601)b)reads:  (b) "Dead Man Rule" in Civil Actions. In civil actions by or against executors, administrators, or guardians, in which judgment may be rendered for or against them as such, neither party shall be allowed to testify against the others as to any oral statement by the testator, intestate or ward, unless that testimony to the oral statement is corroborated or unless the witness is called at the trial to testify thereto by the opposite party; and, the provisions of this article shall extend to and include all actions by or against the heirs or legal representatives of a decedent based in whole or in part on such oral statement. Except for the foregoing, a witness is not precluded from giving evidence of or concerning any transaction with, any conversations with, any admissions of, or statement by, a deceased or insane party or person merely because the witness is a party to the action or a person interested in the event thereof. The trial court shall, in a proper case, where this rule prohibits an interested party or witness from testifying, instruct the jury that such person is not permitted by the law to give evidence relating to any oral statement by the deceased or ward unless the oral statement is corroborated or unless the party or witness is called at the trial by the opposite party.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7052">The '''Decree of Dionysopolis''' was written around 48 BC by the citizens of [[Dionysopolis]] (today's [[Balchik]], on the [[Black Sea]] coast of [[Bulgaria]]) to [[Akornion]], who traveled far away in a diplomatic mission to meet somebody's farther in ''Argedauon''.{{sfn|Crisan|1978|p=61}} The decree, a fragmentary marble inscription, is located in the [[National Historical Museum (Bulgaria)|National Historical Museum]] in [[Sofia]].{{sfn|Mihailov|1970}}

== Inscription ==
The decree mentions a [[Dacians|Dacian]] town named Argedauon ({{lang-grc|Αργεδαυον}}), potentially [[Argidava]] or [[Argedava]].

The stone is damaged and name was read differently by various editors and scholars:
* [ἐπορεύθη εἰς] Ἀργέδα[υι]ον by [[Wilhelm Dittenberger]] (1898){{sfn|Dittenberger|1898|p=547}}
* [πέμψας?] Αρ[γ]έδα[ρ]ον by [[Ernst Kalinka]] (1905){{sfn|Kalinka|1905|pp=87,90-92}}
* [...εἰ]ς Ἀργέδαυον by Wilhelm Dittenberger and [[Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen|Friedrich Hiller]] (1917), noting that the υ is an uncertain reading{{sfn|Dittenberger|Hiller|1917|p=446}}
* Ἀργέδαβον by [[Vasile Pârvan]] (1923){{sfn|Pârvan|1923|pp=14,29-30}}

The inscription also refers to the Dacian king [[Burebista]], and one interpretation is that Akornion was his chief adviser ({{lang-grc|πρῶτοσφίλος}}, literally "first friend") in Dionysopolis.{{sfn|Daicoviciu|1972|p=127}} Other sources indicate that Akornion was sent as an ambassador of Burebista to [[Pompey]], to discuss an alliance against [[Julius Caesar]].{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=47}}

This leads to the assumption that the mentioned ''Argedava'' was Burebista's capital of the Dacian kingdom. This source unfortunately doesn't mention the location of Argedava and historians opinions are split in two groups.

One school of thought, led by historians [[Constantin Daicoviciu]] and [[Hadrian Daicoviciu]], assume the inscription talks about Argidava and place the potential capital of Burebista at [[Vărădia]], [[Caraş-Severin County]], [[Romania]]. The forms ''Argidava'' and ''Arcidava'' found in other ancient sources like [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Geographia]] (c. 150 AD) and [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] (2nd century AD), clearly place a Dacian town with those names at this geographical location. The site is also close to [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]], a later Dacian capital.

Others, led by historian [[Vasile Pârvan]] and professor [[Radu Vulpe]] place ''Argedava'' at [[Popeşti, Giurgiu|Popeşti]], a district in the town of [[Mihăilești]], [[Giurgiu County]], Romania. Arguments include the name connection with the [[Argeş River]], geographical position on a potential road to Dionysopolis which Akornion followed, and most importantly the size of the archaeological discovery at Popeşti that hints to a royal palace. However no other sources seem to name the [[Dava (Dacian)|dava]] discovered at Popeşti, so no exact assumptions can be made about its Dacian name.

It is also quite possible for the two different davae to be just [[homonyms]].

The marble inscription is damaged in many areas, including right before the word "Argedauon", and it is possible the original word could have been "Sargedauon" ({{lang-grc|Σαργεδαυον }}) or "Zargedauon". This form could potentially be linked to "Zargidaua" mentioned by [[Ptolemy]] at a different geographical location. Or again, these two could be simple homonyms.

'''''Devlin v. Smith''''', 89 N.Y. 470 (1882)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawrence.edu/fast/boardmaw/Devlin_v_Smith.html Opinion]&lt;/ref&gt; was a seminal case decided by the [[New York Court of Appeals]] in the area of [[product liability]] law.

The Court held that a duty to third parties "exists when a defect is such as to render the article in itself imminently dangerous, and serious injury to any person using it is a natural and probable consequence of its use." The Court further held that [[scaffolding]] to be used in the painting of a courthouse was an inherently dangerous article.

==Background==
Smith, a painter, employed Stevenson, a contractor, to build a 90-foot-tall scaffold for the express purpose of enabling the painter's workmen to stand upon it.  A workman employed by Smith was killed by a fall, caused by the [[negligence]] of Stevenson in the construction of the scaffold upon which he was working.  As Cardozo noted in McPherson, the contractor knew that workmen would use the scaffold and that, if improperly constructed, the scaffold was a dangerous trap.

The [[administratrix]] sued both Smith and Stevenson for negligence. The trial court dismissed her complaint.  The Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) affirmed. The administratrix appealed.

==Opinion of the court==

On appeal, the court affirmed as to the employer and reversed as to the scaffold-builder. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to require the submission to the jury of the question of whether the failure of the scaffold was attributable to negligence in its construction. The question of [[contributory negligence]] on the part of the deceased was also one for the jury. There was no evidence of negligence on the part of the employer in selecting the scaffold-builder, nor was there any evidence that the employer knew or had reason to know of any defect in the scaffold. The scaffold-builder was not the agent or servant of the employer but an independent contractor for whose acts or omissions the employer was not liable.

Smith's employee was injured when the scaffold collapsed; however, the court held that Smith was not liable under a restricted rule of employer's liability. But as the party responsible for the negligent construction of the scaffold, Stevenson was held liable to the injured workman because he constructed a scaffold that would be imminently dangerous to the user if negligently constructed. Thus, the common-law rule was extended to provide liability for the negligent manufacture of a product that becomes dangerous because it was defectively produced. The court limited liability with a narrow rule of foreseeability. Accordingly, liability to third parties could arise if a defect rendered a product imminently dangerous and serious personal injury was a natural and probable consequence of its use. Id. at 477.

The court noted that ordinarily liability of a manufacturer for defects of a product would be limited by privity. Here the court held, however, that the defendant was liable. The court reasoned:
::[N]otwithstanding this rule, liability to third parties has been held to exist when the defect is such as to render the article in itself imminently dangerous, and serious injury to any person using it is a natural and probable consequence of its use. As where a dealer in drugs carelessly labeled a deadly poison as a harmless medicine, it was held that he was liable not merely to the person to whom he sold it, but to the person who ultimately used it, though it passed through many hands. This liability was held to rest, not upon any contract or direct privity between him and the party injured, but upon the duty which the law imposes on every one to avoid acts in their nature dangerous to the lives of others.
Id.

==Aftermath==

===''Heaven v. Pender''===

Contrast ''[[Heaven v. Pender]]'', 11 Q.B.D. 503., an English case of the next year, in which the court also permitted recovery to a worker injured as the result of defective scaffolding used in the painting of a ship but based its decision not on the inherently dangerous product rule but on the grounds that the dock owner had invited the worker onto the property.

===''McPherson v. Buick Motor Co.''===

Judge Cardozo cited this case in ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'' There, the defendant argued that imminently dangerous products included only poisons, explosives, and firearms; therefore, Buick Motor Company was not liable for its automobile. Disagreeing, Cardozo's majority opinion first traced the judicial development of the imminent danger rule articulated in ''[[Thomas v. Winchester]]'',  in which the court held poison to be imminently dangerous. In Thomas, the New York Court of Appeals held that if a defendant's product placed human life in imminent danger, the defendant would be liable regardless of whether the defendant directly sold the product to the plaintiff. Next, Cardozo's opinion examined the case of ''Devlin v. Smith'',  where the court held a scaffold builder liable to a painter's employee when faulty scaffolding injured the employee.  Finally, Cardozo discussed ''Statler v. George A. Ray Manufacturing Co.'',  in which the court expanded its concept of "imminently dangerous" to include a coffee urn that exploded after the defendant had installed it in a restaurant.

Relying on these precedents, Cardozo wrote in ''MacPherson'': "It may be that Devlin v. Smith and Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co. have extended the rule of Thomas v. Winchester. If so, this court is committed to the extension." Thus, Cardozo concluded, it would be consistent with the "Trend of judicial thought" to classify an automobile as imminently dangerous.

'''The Engraving Copyright Act 1734''' or '''Engravers' Copyright Act''' (8 Geo.2 c.13) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] first read on 4 March 1734/35 and eventually passed on 25 June 1735 to give protections to producers of [[engraving]]s. It is also called '''Hogarth's Act''' after [[William Hogarth]], who prompted the law together with some fellow engravers. Historian Mark Rose notes, "The Act protected only those engravings that involved original designs and thus, implicitly, made a distinction between artists and mere craftsmen. Soon, however, Parliament was persuaded to extend protection to all engravings."&lt;ref name="rose"&gt;Rose, Mark. Technology and Copyright in 1735: The Engraver's Act. The Information Society, Volume 21, Number 1, January–March 2005. pp. 63-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

This Act was one of the [[Copyright Acts 1734 to 1888]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Short Titles Act 1896]], section 2(1) and Schedule 2&lt;/ref&gt;

This Act was [[repeal]]ed by sections 36 and 37(2) of, and schedule 2 to, the [[Copyright Act 1911]] (c.46).

The '''European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)''' is a body of [[European Union|European]] legislation for the regulation of [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]]. It was originally adopted by the EU legislature on July 4, 2012 and came into force on August 16, 2012. Its full technical standards were adopted by the [[European Commission]] on December 19, 2012 and came into effect on March 15, 2013.

The regulations include requirements for reporting of derivative contracts and implementation of risk management standards. It established common rules for [[central counterparty|central counterparties]] and [[Trade Repository|trade repositories]].

The objective of the legislation is to reduce [[systemic risk|systemic]] counterparty and operational risk, and help prevent future financial system collapses. 

==Overview==
The European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) is a body of legislation for [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives]], [[Central Counterparty Clearing|central counterparties]] and [[Trade Repository|trade repositories]].&lt;ref name=FCA14&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/markets/international-markets/emir |title=European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) – what you need to know |author= |date=2014 |work= |publisher=Financial Conduct Authority |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMIR was introduced by the [[European Union]] (EU) as implementation of the [[G-20 major economies|G20 commitment]] to reduce [[Systemic risk|systemic]], [[Credit risk#Counterparty risk|counterparty]] and [[operational risk]], and increase transparency in the OTC [[derivatives market]].&lt;ref name=London15&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year= |title=Implications of a Financial Transaction Tax for the European Regulatory Reform Agenda |journal=City of London Corporation |volume= |issue= |pages=11 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/research-publications/Documents/Research-2014/Implications%20of%20a%20Financial%20Transactions%20Tax%20on%20the%20Regulatory%20Reform%20Agenda.pdf |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also designed as a preventative measure to avoid fallout during possible future [[Financial crisis|financial crises]] similar to the collapse that followed the [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers bankruptcy]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=EMIRspecial&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloombergbriefs.com/content/uploads/sites/2/2014/07/FinReg_EMIR_final-3.pdf |title=EMIR SPECIAL ISSUE 2014 |author= |date=4 February 2014 |work=Bloomberg Briefs |publisher=Bloomberg Business |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It establishes common rules for central counterparties, which interpose themselves between involved parties in a contract to serve as the focal point of each trade,&lt;ref name=ECblogCCP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esma.europa.eu/page/Central-Counterparties |title=Central Counterparties |author= |date= |work= |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and trade repositories, which collect and maintain all records of trades.&lt;ref name=ECblogTR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esma.europa.eu/page/Trade-repositories |title=Trade Repositories |author= |date= |work= |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMIR requires the reporting of all derivatives, whether OTC or [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]] traded, to a trade repository.&lt;ref name=London15/&gt; EMIR covers entities that qualify for derivative contracts in regards to [[interest rate]], [[equity (finance)|equity]], [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]], or [[Credit derivative|credit]] and [[Commodity market|commodity derivatives]].&lt;ref name=FCA14/&gt; It also outlines three sets of obligations, including the clearing, reporting and risk mitigation of applicable products.&lt;ref name=Risk15&gt;{{cite news |title=Evolving post-trade requirements in the new regulatory environment |author= |url=https://www.risk.net/hedge-funds-review/advertisement/2392039/evolving-post-trade-requirements-in-the-new-regulatory-environment |work=Risk.net |date=22 March 2015 |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EMIR's set of obligations were designed to take effect on a phased basis over a period of several years.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2014 |title=EMIR Special Report |journal=Bloomberg Business Briefs |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.bloombergbriefs.com/content/uploads/sites/2/2014/08/EMIR-Supplement-opt2.pdf |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key aspects==
Entities that qualify for EMIR must report every derivative contract they enter into to a trade repository. They must also implement new risk management standards according to EMIR, including operational processes and [[Margin (finance)|margining]] related to their bilateral OTC derivatives. EMIR also covers trades that are not cleared by a central counterparty, and entities that qualify must submit all OTC derivatives subject to a mandatory clearing obligation for review.&lt;ref name=FCA14/&gt; Counterparties must file reports wherever they enter into derivatives transactions, in the [[European Economic Area]] or elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Oblig&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/markets/international-markets/emir/obligations-non-financial-counterparties |title=Obligations for non-financial counterparties under EMIR |author= |date=10 January 2013 |work= |publisher=Financial Conduct Authority |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clearing===
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) applies mandatory [[Clearing (finance)|clearing]] obligations for specific OTC derivative contracts if a contract has been assigned a central counterparty under EMIR.&lt;ref name=FCAclearing&gt;{{cite news |title=One Minute Guide - EU Regulation on OTC derivatives (EMIR) |author= |url=http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/being-regulated/meeting-your-obligations/firm-guides/emir |work=Financial Conduct Authority |date=9 December 2014 |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The obligations require that over-the-counter derivatives trades are cleared through central counterparties. EMIR granted a temporary exemption from these guidelines to [[pension fund]]s until August 2017.&lt;ref name=FCA14/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESMAclearing&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esma.europa.eu/page/OTC-derivatives-and-clearing-obligation |title=OTC derivatives and clearing obligation |author= |date= |work= |publisher=European Securities and Markets Authority |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All parties involved in trades must submit timely notifications of approaching, exceeding, and no longer exceeding the clearing threshold as defined by EMIR. This clearing regulation applies to financial counterparties such as banks, insurers, and [[asset management|managers of assets]], as well as non-financial counterparties.&lt;ref name=ESMAclearing2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esma.europa.eu/page/OTC-derivatives-and-clearing-obligation |title=OTC derivatives and clearing obligation |author= |date= |work= |publisher=ESMA |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reporting===
EMIR requires that all entities entering into derivative contracts must submit reports to their corresponding trade repositories, outlining each over-the-counter trade.&lt;ref name=FCA14/&gt; These mandatory reports must also include a [[Unique Transaction Identifier]] (UTI), legal entity identifier (LEI), information on the trading capacity of the counterparty, and the marked-to-market valuation of the position.&lt;ref name=Hill14&gt;{{cite news |title=European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR): Incomplete Reports Will Be Sent Back, Creating Costs and Other Burdens for Counterparties |author=Charlotte Hill |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/european-market-infrastructure-regulation-emir-incomplete-reports-will-be-sent-back- |work=National Law Review |date=28 July 2014 |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counterparty data in a report includes 26 fields for data and the common data includes 59 fields of data.&lt;ref name=Hill14/&gt; These fields include an LEI, or a unique 20 digit alphanumeric code that may be used for eight of the 26 counterparty data fields, and the unique trade identifier, which are generated based on the report's LEI.&lt;ref name=Hill14/&gt;

[[Block trade]]s, which are large-scale transactions of shares, and any subsequent allocations must be reported to the fund manager, but block trades concluded by a TR are not subject to the obligation.&lt;ref name=FCAppt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fca.org.uk/static/fca/documents/emir-trade-reporting-presentation.pptx |title=EMIR Reporting Technical Standards |author=Victoria Cooley |date= |work=Financial Conduct Authority |publisher= |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESMAtrade&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esma.europa.eu/page/Trade-reporting |title=Trade Reporting |author= |date= |work= |publisher=European Securities and Markets Authority |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the block trade is allocated to the manager’s individual funds on the trade date, only the allocations need to be reported.&lt;ref name=FCAppt/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESMAtrade/&gt; In the event that the block trade is not allocated on the trade date, the block itself must be reported with the fund manager as counterparty.&lt;ref name=FCAppt/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESMAtrade/&gt;

===Risk mitigation===
One of EMIR's central purposes is to manage and avoid [[systemic risk]].&lt;ref name=Williams15&gt;{{cite news |title=Focus on customisation to support HF operational workflows |author=James Williams |url=http://www.hedgeweek.com/2015/05/19/223679/focus-customisation-support-hf-operational-workflows |work=HedgeWeek |date=19 May 2015 |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMIR, and other legislation like it, aim to reduce systemic risk in part by increasing regulations on clearing and trading, which decreases [[Rate of return|returns]] and industry efforts.&lt;ref name=FTSEglobalmarket&gt;{{cite news |title=Keeping transaction reporting up to scratch: you know it makes sense!|author= |url=http://www.ftseglobalmarkets.com/news/keeping-transaction-reporting-up-to-scratch-you-know-it-makes-sense.html |work=FTSE Global Markets |date=5 May 2015 |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under EMIR, the risk mitigation regime applies to contracts involving both EU countries and over the counter derivative contracts involving third country entities.&lt;ref name=Moloney14&gt;{{cite book |title=EU Securities and Financial Markets Regulation |author=Niamh Moloney |authorlink= |year=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn= |page=580 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iS4DBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=emir+risk+mitigation+financial+times&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk mitigation standards outlined in EMIR's Article 11 impose risk management regulation on bilaterally cleared derivatives, as these derivatives are not appropriate for standard central counterparty clearing.&lt;ref name=Moloney14/&gt;

EMIR also advises against [[Mutual fund fees and expenses#Front-end load|front-loading]] over the counter derivatives, or applying any associated fees to sellers alone, as this practice typically increases systemic risk.&lt;ref name=FCAarchiverisk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/markets/international-markets/emir/news-archive |title=EMIR News Archive: European Commission response to ESMA letter regarding frontloading requirement under EMIR |author=ESMA |date=8 July 2014 |work= |publisher=Financial Conduct Authority |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other risk mitigation techniques as defined by EMIR include timely submission of reports and confirmations of adherence to regulation by all counterparties, and open reconciliation and compression of [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolios]] between involved parties.&lt;ref name=ComRegDec&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2013 |title=Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 149/2013 |journal=Official Journal of the European Union |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages= |publisher=European Union |doi= |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:052:0011:0024:EN:PDF |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other techniques include a new dispute resolution process, daily market reports and exchanges and the public exchange of collateral between parties.&lt;ref name=ESMAclearing/&gt;

==History==

===Level 1===
EMIR Regulation No 648/2012, as EMIR is referred to in European legal documentation, was implemented in 2012 through the standard [[co-decision procedure]] of the [[Council of the European Union]], and the [[European Parliament]], which set out a detailed framework for the legislation.&lt;ref name=directive&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2012 |title=Regulations |journal=Official Journal of the European Union |volume=201 |issue= |pages= |publisher=European Union |doi= |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:201:0001:0059:EN:PDF |accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Securities and Markets Authority]] (ESMA) began developing technical standards on regulation of OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories to implement EMIR in February 2012.&lt;ref name=ESMAEMIR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/finance/financial-markets/derivatives/index_en.htm#maincontentSec3 |title=Derivatives / EMIR |author= |date= |work= |publisher=European Markets and Securities Authority |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESMA released a discussion paper on the topic, and in March 2012, the Authority held a public discussion in Paris to receive input on the questions put forth in the discussion paper.&lt;ref name=ESMAEMIR/&gt;&lt;ref name=ECflowchart&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/codecision/stepbystep/diagram_en.htm |title=Codecision Flowchart |author= |date=21 August 2012 |work= |publisher=The European Commission |accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Level 2===
On June 25, 2012, ESMA released a consultation paper publicizing its proposed technical standards.&lt;ref name=ESMAEMIR/&gt;&lt;ref name=ECflowchart/&gt; In July, ESMA hosted another open hearing in Paris. The authority released a final draft technical standards to the European Commission on September 27, 2012.&lt;ref name=ESMAEMIR/&gt;&lt;ref name=ECflowchart/&gt;

EMIR entered into force on August 16, 2012, but most of its provisions only began to apply after a regulation's technical standards take place.&lt;ref name=FCA14/&gt; These technical standards were adopted by the European Commission on December 19, 2012.&lt;ref name=ECfaq&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/finance/financial-markets/docs/derivatives/emir-faqs_en.pdf |title=EMIR: Frequently asked questions |author= |date=10 July 2014 |work= |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After more discussion and public reports, EMIR was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on July 27, 2012, and the technical standards of EMIR came into effect on March 15, 2013.&lt;ref name=FCA14/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESMAFR&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year= |title=Draft technical standards under the Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC Derivatives, CCPs and Trade Repositories |journal=Final Report |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher=European Securities and Markets Authority |doi= |url=http://www.esma.europa.eu/system/files/2012-600_0.pdf |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many involved parties expressed difficulty reporting during the first six months of the regulations being in effect, and many experienced delays in reporting.&lt;ref name=FCA14/&gt;&lt;ref name=ATM15&gt;{{cite news |title=JWG regulatory trading digest - The end of the beginning: conclusions from Paris |author= |url=http://www.automatedtrader.net/articles/regulation/153399/jwg-regulatory-trading-digest-_-the-end-of-the-beginning--conclusions-from-paris |work=Automated Trader Magazine |date=2015 |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wigan14&gt;{{cite news |title=Industry divided as regulators mull NDF clearing |author=David Wigan |url=http://www.euromoney.com/Article/3399735/Industry-divided-as-regulators-mull-NDF-clearing.html |work=Euromoney Magazine |date=12 November 2014 |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, the European Commission adopted a Delegated EMIR Regulation to include the central banks and debt management offices in Japan and the United States to be exempt from EMIR.&lt;ref name=ECEmirder&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/finance/financial-markets/derivatives/index_en.htm |title=Adoption of a Delegated Regulation on the list of exempted entities under EMIR – 12.07.2013 |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=27 April 2015}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=directive/&gt; On July 12, 2013, ESMA published a discussion paper specifically describing the clearing obligation as defined by EMIR. The discussion was closed on September 16, 2013.&lt;ref name=esmadiscussions&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.esma.europa.eu/consultations/overview/10?title=emir&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;field_consultation_status_value=Open+Closed&amp;name= |title=Consultations Overview |author= |date= |work= |publisher=European Securities and Markets Authority |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, UK Parliament reviewed a second EMIR statutory instrument, which outlines additional supervisory and enforcement powers allotted to central counterparties during trading and clearing.&lt;ref name=FCAarchive&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/markets/international-markets/emir/news-archive |title=FCA EMIR News Archive |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Financial Conduct Authority |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, new obligations embedded into EMIR took effect, requiring EU banks and their counterparties to discuss and agree on processes and procedures for portfolio reconciliation and dispute resolution of derivatives executed in the OTC market.&lt;ref name=FCA14/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt; In October 2013, in response to the reported difficulties, ESMA announced that trade repositories should send back incomplete reports to counterparties, asking for their rectification, instead of trying to reconcile them.&lt;ref name=FCA14/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wigan14/&gt; In November 2013, ESMA published the final draft on EMIR's technical standards in regards to non-EU counterparties.&lt;ref name=FCAarchive/&gt; In January 2014, mandatory transaction reporting for OTC derivatives began under EMIR.&lt;ref name=FCA14/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;

On October 1, 2014, ESMA began a consultation on EMIR's clearing obligation. The consultation closed on November 6, 2014.&lt;ref name=esmadiscussions/&gt; ESMA published the eleventh iteration of its Q&amp;A report on EMIR on October 24, 2014.&lt;ref name=FCA14/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt; In the report, ESMA announced that any third country firm not originally subject to EMIR trade reporting obligations that subsequently becomes a financial counterparty subject to EMIR must comply with the EMIR reporting obligation in respect of all outstanding derivatives contracts.&lt;ref name=FCA14/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;

ESMA conducted another consultation on the technical standards of reporting under EMIR between November 10, 2014 and February 3, 2015.&lt;ref name=esmadiscussions/&gt;

Mandatory reporting for exchange-traded derivatives began in January 2015, and in February of the same year, a European Commission report recommended an extension to the exemption until August 2017.&lt;ref name=FCA14/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt; As of March 2015, EMIR's regulations are under analysis in regards to pension funds, with the possibility of extending the extension to 2018.&lt;ref name=FCA14/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt; As of May 5, 2015, ESMA has been discussing a fourth consultation, this time revisiting the clearing obligation under EMIR.&lt;ref name=esmadiscussions/&gt; The 2013 report on clearing indicated a need for further analysis of the classes of OTC interest rate derivatives denominated in other currencies than the ones included in the first report, and the 2015 consultation is expected to present new analysis and invite discussion on these other currencies.&lt;ref name=esmadiscussions/&gt; The consultation is expected to conclude on July 15, 2015.&lt;ref name=esmadiscussions/&gt;

The '''''German Law Journal''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]], online-only [[open access]] [[law journal]] reporting on the developments in [[Law of Germany|German]], [[European Union Law|European]] and [[International law|international]] [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |url=http://germanlawjournal.com/about_glj.php |title=About the journal |format= |work=German Law Journal |accessdate=2011-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513083326/http://www.germanlawjournal.com/about_glj.php |archivedate=2009-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published by [[Washington &amp; Lee University School of Law]].

Publication of the journal started in 2000. The journal was co-founded by its [[editor-in-chief]], Russell A. Miller and [[Peer Zumbansen|Peer C. Zumbansen]]. The journal is published bi-monthly.

On the occasion of its 10th anniversary, the journal was honoured by the [[Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany)|German Minister of Justice]], [[Brigitte Zypries]], for being an "ambassador of German law".&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.de/enid/98579d0c6d61f0f5d123e608c224f824,29d47a706d635f6964092d0936303637093a0979656172092d0932303039093a096d6f6e7468092d093037093a095f7472636964092d0936303637/Pressestelle/Pressemitteilungen_58.html |title=BMJ &amp;#124; Pressemitteilungen &amp;#124; Zypries ehrt "Botschafter für das deutsche Recht" |language=German |work= |accessdate=2010-11-08 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special issues ==
In addition to its regular monthly publications, from time to time the journal publishes special issues devoted to a particular developing topic in German, European, or international [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name=issues&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.germanlawjournal.com/index.php?pageID=13 |title=Past Special Issues |format= |work=German Law Journal |accessdate=2011-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018093904/http://www.germanlawjournal.com/index.php?pageID=13 |archivedate=2011-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the past, the journal published special issues on "The Transnationalization of Legal Education", "The Transnationalization of Legal Cultures", and "Legal Positivism", among others.&lt;ref name="issues"/&gt;

'''Haleigh Poutre''' (born February 24, 1994) is an [[United States|American]] girl who became the subject of a legal controversy regarding the removal of [[life support]] for patients in [[Vegetative states|persistent vegetative states]]. In 2006, eleven-year-old Poutre awoke from a coma shortly before she was scheduled to be removed from life support. Poutre had a severe [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]] thought to be caused by abuse by her adoptive mother.&lt;ref name="bherald"&gt;Boston Herald [http://bostonherald.com/news/regional/general/view.bg?articleid=1076311&amp;format=text Court records: Haleigh Poutre ’making statements’ about abuse], February 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The case brought about many changes in the [[Massachusetts]] [[Department of Social Services]], both in the way they handle reports of [[child abuse]] as well as their policies on end-of-life care for children in their custody.&lt;ref name="Ring"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ring|first=Dan|title=Gov.

==Background==
At the age of four, Haleigh Poutre went to live with her maternal aunt, Holli Strickland, and Strickland's husband Jason, following allegations of [[sexual abuse]] at the hands of her mother's boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wen|first=Patricia|title=Haleigh Poutre's mother seeks documents from DSS|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/05/15/haleigh_poutres_mother_seeks_documents_from_dss/|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=May 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Holli Strickland alone legally adopted Haleigh. When asked in court why he never legally adopted Haleigh, Jason Strickland replied "Honestly, I didn't feel like I needed a piece of paper to say I was her father."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Buffy|title=Jason Strickland denies hitting his stepdaughter, Haleigh Poutre|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/11/jason_strickland_tells_court_h.html|newspaper=The Republican|date=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injury==
On September 11, 2005, Haleigh was taken to the emergency room at Noble Hospital in [[Westfield, Massachusetts]], by Holli and Jason Strickland. They reported to medical staff that she had become [[unresponsive]] after suffering from "flu-like symptoms". Physicians determined that her [[brain stem]] was partly [[Diffuse axonal injury|sheared]], leaving her in a vegetative state. Physicians also noted a number of other injuries including broken teeth, numerous [[contusions]] and [[lacerations]] on Haleigh's body, and several [[Burn (injury)|burns]] in various stages of healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Buffy|title=Nurses tell court about Haleigh Poutre's lifeless condition when she was brought to hospital|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/11/nurses_tell_court_about_haleig.html?category=Crime&amp;category=Westfield|accessdate=November 5, 2008|newspaper=The republican}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2005, the Stricklands were arrested and charged with [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]]. Holli Strickland was shot to death two days later while out on [[Bail (law)|bond]]. Police believe her death on September 22, 2005, to be a [[murder-suicide]] at the hands of her grandmother, Constance Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Buffy|title=Strickland sentenced to 12 to 15 years in state prison in Haleigh Poutre case|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/12/strickland_sentenced_to.html|newspaper=The Republican|date=December 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chronology of alleged abuse case|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/01/18/chronology_of_alleged_abuse_case/|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=January 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== End of life debate ==
Following criminal charges, the department of social services took custody of eleven-year-old Poutre. Eight days after she was admitted to the hospital, Harry Spence, the commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Social Services, sought to remove her from life support. Physicians involved in the case asserted that Poutre was in a vegetative state, and "virtually [[brain dead]]." On Oct. 5, 2005, a judge approved the request. Jason Strickland, Poutre's stepfather, appealed the decision.&lt;ref name="Conley"/&gt; Although Jason Strickland had never legally adopted Poutre, he asserted his right to make the decision as the ''[[de facto]]'' parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fahrenthold|first=David|title=Comatose girl can be removed from life support, court rules|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/17/AR2006011701258.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complicating the issue was the criminal case against Jason Strickland. If Poutre died, the state could bring [[Homicide|murder charges]] against Strickland. But if she lived, even in a vegetative state, the charges brought against Strickland were significantly less severe. Many perceived the actions of Strickland to be an attempt at evading homicide charges.&lt;ref name="Conley"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wen|first=Patricia|title=Girl with damage to brain is sent to rehab center|url=http://www.boston.com/yourlife/health/other/articles/2006/01/27/girl_with_damage_to_brain_is_sent_to_rehab_center/|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=January 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2006, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of the Department of Social Services that life support could be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wen|first=Patricia|title=SJC: State can remove 11 year old from life support|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/01/17/sjc_state_can_remove_11_year_old_from_life_support/|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=January 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 18, 2006, as physicians were preparing to remove life support, Poutre regained consciousness. In the presence of Harry Spence, [[social workers]] asked Poutre to identify a series of items in front of her and she successfully completed the task. The order to remove life support was cancelled.&lt;ref name="Conley"/&gt; 

A number of [[Right to Life]] groups involved themselves with Poutre's case. They noted parallels between this case and the high profile [[Terri Schiavo]] case which had ended in her death earlier that year. Schiavo's family, who runs the Terri Schindler Schiavo Foundation Center for Health Care Ethics Inc., contacted [[Mitt Romney]] regarding the Poutre case. Schiavo's father, Bob Schindler Sr., commented that there have been many similar cases and his foundation's goal is "essentially to guard against this rush to judgment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Helman|first=Scott|title=SCHIAVO'S KIN JOIN POUTRE DEBATE|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=Apr 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy changes in response to the case==

The Department of Social Services faced harsh criticism for their role in the case. On June 14, 2006, a legislative oversight committee determined that Department of Social Services was at fault for failing to protect Poutre. Department of Social Services officials have acknowledged that they missed signs of abuse before she was brought to the hospital in September.&lt;ref name="Levenson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Levenson|first=Michael|title=Lawmakers criticize DSS care of Haleigh Poutre|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2006/06/lawmakers_criti.html|newspaper=the Boston Globe|date=June 14, 06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Department of Social Services received at least twelve reports of abuse or [[neglect]] of Poutre between 2001 and 2005. The department had been working with the Strickland family since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Buffy|title=Jury in Jason Strickland trial sees videotape showing Haleigh Poutre in rehabilitation hospital|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/11/jury_sees_haleigh_poutre_helpe.html|newspaper=The Republican|date=November 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel recommended a number of changes, including the creation of an audit bureau to review cases, an increase of educational requirements for social workers, and a revamping of abuse reporting systems.&lt;ref name="Levenson"/&gt;

In March 2006, Governor Mitt Romney appointed a panel of specialists to evaluate the case. "Haleigh's case highlights a frightening confluence of a health care system ignorant of abuse and a child protective system ignorant of medicine," they said. The panel also said current Department of Social Services procedures are "substantially insufficient" in their ability to make decisions regarding the withdrawal of life support from children in their [[Child custody|custody]]. Recommendations included a number of changes, including increased access to medical, psychiatric, and child abuse expertise, and the creation of a new system for making end-of-life decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wen|first=Patricia|title=Romney panel blasts system familure in haleigh poutre case|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2006/03/romney_panel_bl.html|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=March 21, 06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2008, Governor [[Deval L. Patrick]] passed a new law to overhaul the child welfare system in Massachusetts. Changes include a requirement that the case undergo a special review by a state board if the Department of Social Services receives three or more reports of suspected child abuse. The results of that review will then be evaluated by prosecutors and police in the area. A new child-advocate position was also created. This advocate reports directly to the governor regarding severe child abuse or [[neglect]] in the state. The new law also involves increased penalties for failing to report child abuse. A new registry for keeping track of [[foster parents]] was also implemented. These changes were made largely in response to the Poutre case.&lt;ref name="Ring"/&gt;

==Criminal case==
In 2008, Jason Strickland was tried for the assault. Strickland admitted noticing Poutre's injuries, but claimed he believed Holli's story that the injuries were [[Self inflicted injury|self inflicted]]. The story was also believed by the Department of Social Services and was the reason she was not removed from the home despite numerous reports to the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wen|first=Patricia|title=Video shows Haleigh Poutre writing, feeding self|url=http://www.bostoncriminallawyerblog.com/2008/12/haleigh_poutres_stepdad_is_sen.html|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=November 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During deliberations, jurors questioned whether Jason Strickland had to be present at the time of the assault in order for them to return a guilty verdict. Judge Carhart instructed them that he did not have to be present, but they would have to believe that an "ordinary person" would have realized that leaving Poutre in the care of Holli Strickland presented a serious risk of bodily harm. Strickland was convicted under this premise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Buffy|title=Sentencing delayed for Jason Strickland, convicted of allowing assault on his stepdaughter, Haleigh Poutre|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/12/sentencing_delayed_for_jason_s.html|newspaper=The Republican|date=December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the trial, a friend of Holli Strickland's testified that she witnessed Holli push Poutre down the stairs three times in a row as a punishment, each time screaming at her to walk back up before pushing her down them again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Buffy|title=Haleigh Poutre's babysitter testifies she saw child abuse|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/11/haleigh_poutres_babysitter_tes.html|newspaper=The Republican|date=November 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jurors did not believe that Jason Strickland was present for the specific assault that led to Poutre's near fatal injuries, but that he knew the abuse was ongoing. He was also convicted of other charges of assault and battery for striking Poutre himself on previous occasions; he was convicted on the assumption that although Holli was the primary abuser, he failed to stop that abuse. Strickland was sentenced to twelve to fifteen years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reitz|first=Stephanie|title=Mass. man gets 12-15 years for stepchild beating|url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2008Dec18/0,4675,BrainInjuredGirl,00.html|newspaper=Fox News|date=December 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poutre's recovery==

In 2008, Poutre was released from Brighton rehabilitation hospital to live as a foster child with Keith and Becky Arnett in [[Southwick, Massachusetts]]. She was adopted by the Arnetts in 2010 at the age of sixteen and attended a special education program in the Southwick public school system. She remains substantially disabled and relies on a wheelchair, but is able to feed herself and use a letterboard to communicate.&lt;ref name=adoption&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wen|first1=Patricia|title=Timeline: The case of Haleigh Poutre|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/2014/08/02/timeline-the-case-haleigh-poutre/9j3BhnkLrA8AxlYo4PZWoN/story.html|agency=The Boston Globe|date=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the attack, Poutre's adoptive father reports that she knows she was hurt, but she is unable to remember any specifics about the event.&lt;ref name=Goslee&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goslee|first1=Kaitlin|title=Haleigh Poutre, 10 years later|url=http://wwlp.com/2015/05/11/haleigh-poutre-10-years-later/|agency=WWLP News 22|date=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wen|first=Patricia|title=Video shows Haleigh Poutre writing, feeding self|url=http://www.bostoncriminallawyerblog.com/2008/12/haleigh_poutres_stepdad_is_sen.html|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=November 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harold Joseph Pringle''' (died 5 July 1945) was the only soldier of the [[Canadian Army]] to be [[Execution by firing squad|executed]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name=CMJ&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo4/no2/book-livre-04-eng.asp |title=A Keen Soldier: The Execution of Second World War Private Harold Pringle (book review) |last=Lukits |first=Dr. Steve |magazine=[[Canadian Military Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pringle and his father tried to enlist in [[The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment]] of the Canadian Army.&lt;ref name=CMJ/&gt; On medical examination, he was accepted, but his father was turned away due to poor eyesight.

Pringle was a disciplinary problem for his unit, going [[Desertion#Absence without leave|AWOL]] many times, and he was sent to a reformatory camp for a year. He escaped after serving six months there and was sent to Italy where he was posted to the 1st Battalion, The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment, as a private with the service number C/5292. Pringle's combat record after the escape was unblemished until after the battle for the [[Hitler Line]] in central [[Italy]], when he deserted to Rome to join the Sailor Gang. 

The Sailor Gang, though only five members strong, was similar to the larger and better organized Lane Gang&amp;mdash;both gangs smuggled goods into Rome for the [[black market]]. The members of the Sailor Gang lived pleasantly for many months, but then things started going downhill. They were almost always drunk, got into fights, and made rash decisions, to the point where one of their members shot another. They tried to take him to the local field hospital, and all of his gang (except one who was given immunity for his testimony at their trials) alleged that he died on the way, claiming also that Pringle and the gang leader shot the man after he was dead several times so it would look like a Mafia killing. The dead gang member was discovered and police apprehended almost all the members of the Sailor Gang, along with the members of the similar, but larger, Lane Gang. 

The various gang members were tried, and Pringle was sentenced to death for murder.&lt;ref name=CMJ/&gt; An appeal against the decision was rejected. On 5 July 1945, Pringle was executed by a Canadian Army firing squad.&lt;ref name=CMJ/&gt; He was buried in grave number 11, row B, plot VII at [[Caserta]] [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|CWGC]] Cemetery in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2067516 CWGC :Casualty Details&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.cwgc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herschel Feibel Grynszpan''' ({{lang-de|Hermann Grünspan}}; 28 March 1921 – last rumoured to be alive 1945, declared dead 1960) was a Polish-Jewish refugee, born in Germany. His assassination of the German diplomat [[Ernst vom Rath]] on 7 November 1938 in Paris was used by the Nazis as a pretext to launch ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] [[pogrom]] of 9–10 November 1938. Grynszpan was seized by the [[Gestapo]] after the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] and brought to Germany. Grynszpan's eventual fate remains unknown. It is generally assumed that he did not survive the [[Second World War]], and he was [[declared death in absentia|declared dead]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grynszpan, Herschel|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%206321.pdf|publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 a photograph of a man resembling Grynszpan was cited as evidence to support the claim that he was still alive in [[Bamberg]], [[Germany]], as of 3 July 1946.&lt;ref name="Guardian - 18-12-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connolly|first1=Kate|title=Photo mystery of Jewish assassin used by Nazis to justify Kristallnacht|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/18/herschel-grynszpan-photo-mystery-jewish-assassin-kristallnacht-pogrom|accessdate=23 December 2016|work=The Guardian|date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the subject of the book ''The Short, Strange Life of Herschel Grynszpan'', by author [[Jonathan Kirsch]].&lt;ref name="Kirsch2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Kirsch|title=The Short, Strange Life of Herschel Grynszpan: A Boy Avenger, a Nazi Diplomat, and a Murder in Paris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HgbGAgAAQBAJ|date=10 February 2014|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-87140-740-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Herschel Grynszpan was born in [[Hanover]], Germany. His parents, Sendel and Riva, were [[Polish Jews]] who had emigrated from Poland in 1911 and settled in Hanover, where Sendel opened a tailor's shop, from which the family made a modest living. Because of the German Citizenship Law of 1913, based on the principles of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', Grynszpan was never a German citizen despite being born in Germany.&lt;ref name="Steinweis pages 471-488"&gt;Steinweis, Alan "The Trials of Herschel Grynszpan: Anti-Jewish Policy and German Propaganda, 1938-1942" pages 471-488 from ''German Studies Review'', Volume 31, Issue #3, October 2008 page 472&lt;/ref&gt; They became Polish citizens after the [[First World War]], and retained that status during their years in Germany.{{sfn|Schwab|1990|p=43}} Herschel was the youngest of six children, only three of whom survived childhood. The first child was stillborn in 1912. The second child, daughter Sophie Helena, born in 1914, died of [[scarlet fever]] in 1928. A daughter Esther was born on 31 January 1916, and a son, Mordechai, on 29 August 1919. A fifth child, Salomone, was born in 1920 and died in 1931 in a road accident. On 28 March 1921, Herschel was born.{{sfn|Schwab|1990|p=43}}

The Grynszpan family were ''[[Ostjuden]]'' ("Eastern Jews") as the Germans and many Jews in West Europe described Jews from [[Eastern Europe]]. The ''Ostjuden'' usually spoke [[Yiddish]] and they also tended to be considerably more religiously observant, impoverished and less well educated than [[German Jews]]. Given the situation of the ''Ostjuden'' in Germany, unlike German Jews who tended to see themselves as Germans first and Jews second, Grynszpan grew up with an intense sense of his Jewishness, and he always regarded himself first and foremost as a Jew. Grynszpan dropped out of school at the age of 14.&lt;ref name="Schmitteroth, Linda page 198"&gt;Schmitteroth, Linda &amp; Rosteck, Mary Kay ''People of the Holocaust'', U-X-L: Detroit, 1998 page 198&lt;/ref&gt; Grynszpan was considered by his teachers to be an intelligent, if rather lazy, student who never seemed to try to excel at his studies.&lt;ref name="Schmitteroth, Linda page 198"/&gt; Grynszpan himself later complained that his teachers disliked him because he was an ''Ostjude'', and that he was treated as an "outcast" by both his German teachers and fellow students.&lt;ref name="Schmitteroth, Linda page 198"/&gt; As a child and a teenager, Grynszpan was well known for his violent temper, and his tendency to respond to any anti-Semitic insult with his fists, leading him to be frequently suspended from school for the fights that he was often getting into.&lt;ref name="Schmitteroth, Linda page 198"/&gt;

==Hanover to Paris==
Herschel attended a state primary school until he was 14, in 1935. He later said that he left school because Jewish pupils were already facing discrimination. He was an intelligent, too sensitive and easily provoked youth with few close friends who found him too touchy, although he was an active member of the Jewish youth sports club, [[Bar-Kochba]] Hanover. When he left school, his parents decided there was no future for him in Germany, and tried to arrange for him to emigrate to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. With financial assistance from Hanover's Jewish community, Herschel was sent to a [[yeshiva]] (rabbinical seminary) in [[Frankfurt]], where he studied [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and the [[Torah]]: he was, by all accounts, more religious than his parents. After eleven months he left the yeshiva and returned to Hanover, where he applied to emigrate to Palestine. But the local Palestine emigration office told him he was too young, and would have to wait a year. Rather than wait, Herschel and his parents decided that he should go to live with his uncle and aunt, Abraham and Chawa Grynszpan, in [[Paris]]. He obtained a Polish passport and a German residence permit, and received permission to leave Germany for Belgium, where another uncle, Wolf Grynszpan, was living. He had no intention of staying in Belgium, however, and in September 1936, he entered France illegally. He was unable to enter France legally because he had no financial support, while Jews were not permitted to take money out of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Falk|first=Gerhard|title=The Persecution of the German Jews, 1933 - 1941|url=http://jbuff.com/c011013.htm|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, Grynszpan lived in a small [[Yiddish]]-speaking enclave of Polish [[Orthodox Jews]], and he met few people outside it, learning only a few words of French in two years. Initially, Grynszpan lived a carefree, bohemian life as a "poet of the streets", spending his days aimlessly wandering the streets of Paris reciting Yiddish poems to himself; Grynszpan's two biggest interests other than exploring Paris were hanging out in coffeehouses and going to the cinema.&lt;ref name="Schmitteroth, Linda page 198"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwab, Gerald pages 57-58"&gt;Schwab, Gerald ''The Day the Holocaust Began'', New York: Praeger, 1990 pages 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Grynszpan spent this period trying to get legal residence in France, without which he could not work or study legally, but was rejected by French officials. His re-entry permit for Germany expired in April 1937 and his Polish passport expired in January 1938, leaving him without legal papers. In July 1937, the Prefecture of Police ruled that Grynszpan had no basis for his request to stay in France, and in August he was ordered to leave the country. He had no re-entry permit for Germany and in any case had no desire to go there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jdFtAAAAMAAJ The Day the Holocaust Began: The Odyssey of Herschel Grynszpan], page 194&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1938, Poland had passed a law depriving Polish citizens who had lived continuously abroad for more than five years of their citizenship.&lt;ref name="Dz.U. 1938"&gt;[http://niniwa2.cba.pl/CYTATY3.HTM ''Commentary by Jerzy Tomaszewski''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102081125/http://niniwa2.cba.pl/CYTATY3.HTM |date=2 November 2012 }} {{Who|date=May 2013}} {{cite web|url=http://sejmometr.pl/ustawy/2175|title=Ustawa z dnia|date=31 March 1938|publisher=Fundacja ePaństwo|work=Dz.U. z 1938 r.

The lonely Grynszpan living in poverty on the margins of French life as an illegal immigrant, and with no real skills or having much in the way of a future, grew increasingly desperate and angry as his situation continued to worsen.&lt;ref name="Schwab, Gerald pages 57-58"/&gt; Grynszpan was afraid to take a job because of his illegal immigrant status, and depended upon his uncle Abraham to support him, who himself was extremely poor, and could only provide so much for his nephew.&lt;ref name="Schmitteroth, Linda page 198"/&gt; Grynszpan's refusal to work caused much tension with his uncle and aunt, who frequently told him that he was a major drain on their finances, and he had to take a job, regardless of the heightened risk of deportation that it entailed.&lt;ref name="Schmitteroth, Linda page 198"/&gt; From October 1938 onwards, Grynszpan was in constant hiding as the French police were looking for him in order to deport him, a situation that put Grynszpan under considerable stress and strain.&lt;ref name="Schwab, Gerald pages 57-58"/&gt; The few who did know Grynszpan in Paris described him as a shy, but intensely emotional teenager who often cried when discussing the sufferings of Jews around the world, a subject that he was obsessed with, especially the suffering of his beloved family back in Germany.&lt;ref name="Schwab, Gerald pages 57-58"/&gt; Grynszpan came from an extremely close-knit, loving family and for him, his family was his world; Grynszpan often spoke of his great love for his family and of how much he missed them.&lt;ref name="Schwab, Gerald pages 57-58"/&gt;

== From exile to assassin ==
Meanwhile, the position of the Grynszpan family in Hanover was becoming increasingly precarious. Sendel's business was declining, and Herschel's siblings both lost their jobs. In August 1938 the German authorities announced that all residence permits for foreigners were being cancelled and would have to be renewed. This was in reaction to a Polish decree which was to take away the Polish citizenship of Jews living outside the country, including those in Germany. A few days before that decree was to come into force, on 26 October, the [[Gestapo]] was ordered to arrest and deport all Polish Jews residing in Germany immediately, an event called the [[Polenaktion]]. The Grynszpan family was among the estimated 12,000 Polish Jews arrested, stripped of their property, and herded aboard trains headed for Poland. At the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]], Sendel Grynszpan recounted the events of their deportation on the night of 27 October 1938: "Then they took us in police trucks, in prisoners' lorries, about 20 men in each truck, and they took us to the railway station. The streets were full of people shouting: "Juden raus! Raus nach Palästina!" ("Out with the Jews! Off to Palestine!").&lt;ref&gt;[[Hannah Arendt|Arendt, Hannah]]. ''Eichmann in Jerusalem'', p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

When they reached the border, they were forced to walk {{convert|2|km}} to the Polish border town of [[Zbąszyń]] (''Bentschen'', in German). Poland refused to admit them at first, as the ''[[Sanation]]'' regime had no intention to accept the return of those it had just stripped of their Polish citizenship.&lt;ref name="Longerich, Peter pages 109-110"&gt;Longerich, Peter ''The Holocaust'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010 pages 109-110&lt;/ref&gt; The "Polenaktion" stopped on October 29, when the Polish government threatened to start expelling German nationals from Poland.&lt;ref name="Longerich, Peter pages 109-110"/&gt; The Grynszpans and thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees stranded at the border were fed by the [[Polish Red Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zbaszyn1938.pl/zbaszyn/en | title=The deportations of Polish Jews from Germany to Zbąszyń in 1938 | accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions for the hapless refugees trapped out in the open on the German-Polish frontier were extremely bad. A British woman who went to work with the Red Cross in providing help reported: "I found thousands crowded together in pigsties. The old, the sick and children herded together in the most inhumane conditions."&lt;ref name="Gilbert, Martin page 68"&gt;Gilbert, Martin ''The Holocaust The Jewish Tragedy'', New York: HarperCollins, 1987 page 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Life there was so bad, she continued "that some actually tried to escape ''back'' to Germany and were shot".&lt;ref name="Gilbert, Martin page 68"/&gt; It was from Zbąszyn that his sister Berta sent a postcard to Herschel in Paris, recounting what had happened and, in a line that was crossed out, apparently pleading for help. The postcard was dated 31 October and reached Herschel on Thursday, 3 November.

On the evening of Sunday, 6 November 1938, Grynszpan asked his uncle Abraham to send money to his family. Abraham said he had little to spare, and that he was incurring both financial cost and legal risks by harbouring his nephew, an [[undocumented alien]] and unemployed youth. There was a furious scene, and Herschel walked out of his uncle's house carrying about 300 [[French franc|francs]] which was a day's average wage in Paris at the time. He spent the night in a cheap hotel. On the morning of 7 November, Grynszpan wrote a farewell [[postcard]] to his parents, which he put in a pocket. He went to a gunshop in the Rue du Faubourg St Martin, where he bought a 6.35mm [[revolver]] and a box of 25 bullets for 235 francs. He caught the [[Paris Métro|metro]] to the [[Solférino (Paris Métro)|Solférino station]] and walked to the German Embassy at 78 Rue de Lille. It is generally believed that Grynszpan wanted to assassinate Count Johannes von Welczeck, the German ambassador to France.&lt;ref&gt;Norden, Margaret "The American Editorial to the Rise of Adolf Hitler: A Preliminary Consideration" pages 211-222 from ''America, American Jews, and the Holocaust: American Jewish History'' edited by Jeffrey Gurock, London: Routledge, 1998 page 222.&lt;/ref&gt; As he entered the embassy, Grynszpan walked past Count von Welczeck, who was leaving for his daily morning walk on the Paris streets. At 09:45 am at the Embassy reception desk, Grynszpan represented himself as a German resident and asked to see an Embassy official; he did not ask for anyone by name (an important point in the light of later events). Grynszpan claimed to be some sort of spy who had very important intelligence, which he had to hand over to the most senior diplomat available, preferably the ambassador. Unaware that he had just walked past Count von Welczeck, Grynszpan asked if he could see "His Excellency, the ambassador", to hand over the "most important document" he claimed to have.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsch, Jonathan ''The Short, Strange Life of Herschel Grynszpan'', New York: W.W. Norton page 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The clerk on duty asked [[Ernst vom Rath]], the more junior of the two Embassy officials available, to see him. When Grynszpan entered vom Rath's office, Rath asked to see the "most important document". Instead, Grynszpan pulled out his gun and shot him five times in the abdomen. According to the French police account, he shouted "You're a filthy [[Wiktionary:Boche|boche]]" and that he acted in the name of 12,000 persecuted Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prempain|first1=Laurence|last2=Wyler|first2=Manuela|title=Kristalnacht 9-19 novembre 1938|url=http://jewishtraces.org/kristalnacht-9-10-novembre-1938/|work=Jewishtraces.org|accessdate=3 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926033829/http://jewishtraces.org/kristalnacht-9-10-novembre-1938/|archivedate=26 September 2014|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grynszpan made no attempt to resist or escape, and he identified himself correctly to the French police. He confessed to shooting vom Rath (who was in critical condition in a hospital), and again said that his motive for doing so was to avenge the persecuted Jews. In his pocket was the postcard to his parents. It said: "With God's help. My dear parents, I could not do otherwise, may God forgive me, the heart bleeds when I hear of your tragedy and that of the 12,000 Jews. I must protest so that the whole world hears my protest, and that I will do. Forgive me. Hermann [his German name]"{{sfn|Schwab|1990|p=43}}

==Consequences==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kristallnacht example of physical damage.jpg|Kristallnacht, example of physical damage|right|thumb|Looted Jewish shops on the morning after ''Kristallnacht'']] --&gt;
Despite the best efforts of French and German doctors, including [[Adolf Hitler]]'s personal physician [[Karl Brandt (Nazi physician)|Karl Brandt]], vom Rath died on 9 November, aged 29. On 17 November, vom Rath was given a state funeral in [[Düsseldorf]], which was attended by Hitler and Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] with considerable publicity. In his funeral oration, Ribbentrop described the shooting as an attack by the Jews on the German people: "We understand the challenge, and we accept it", he said. Then, vom Rath's assassination was used as a justification for planned anti-semitic atrocities and pogroms in Germany. The day of Rath's death was the fifteenth anniversary of the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] of 1923, the "''Tag der Bewegung''" (Day of the Movement): the greatest day of the Nazi calendar. That evening Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]], after consulting with Hitler, made an inflammatory speech at the [[Bürgerbräukeller]] beer hall in [[Munich]] where the Putsch had been organised, in front of a crowd of veteran Nazis from all over Germany. It would not be surprising, he said, if the German people were so outraged by the assassination of a German diplomat by a Jew that they took the law into their own hands and attacked Jewish businesses, community centres and [[synagogue]]s. Such "spontaneous outbursts", he said, should not be openly organised by the [[Nazi Party]] or the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] but neither should they be opposed or prevented. That Rath's death was only a pretext was shown by Goebbels's diary entry from that day where Goebbels wrote: "In the afternoon the death of the German diplomat vom Rath is announced. That's good...I go to the Party reception in the old Rathaus. Terrific activity. I brief Hitler on the affair. He decides: allow the demonstrations to go on. Withdraw the police. The Jews should feel the people's fury. That's right. I issue appropriate instructions to the police and party. Then I give a brief speech on the subject to the Party's leadership. Thunderous applause. Everyone dashed to the telephone. Now the people will act".&lt;ref&gt;Longerich, Peter ''The Holocaust'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010 page 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours, Nazis began a [[pogrom]] against Jewish communities throughout Germany, known as ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' ("Night of Broken Glass"), which lasted all night and into the next day. More than 90 people were killed, more than 30,000 Jews arrested and sent to concentration camps (where over a thousand died of mistreatment before the remainder were released some months later) and thousands of Jewish shops, homes, offices and more than 200 synagogues smashed up or burned.&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2011/06/world-war-ii-before-the-war/100089/ "World War II: Before the War"], ''The Atlantic'', 19 June 2011. "Windows of shops owned by Jews which were broken during a coordinated anti-Jewish demonstration in Berlin, known as ''Kristallnacht'', on 10 November 1938. Nazi authorities turned a blind eye as SA stormtroopers and civilians destroyed storefronts with hammers, leaving the streets covered in pieces of smashed windows. Ninety-one Jews were killed, and 30,000 Jewish men were taken to concentration camps.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1 billion Reichsmarks' damage to property was reported (about US$400 million at the time, or US$6.7 billion in 2015 dollars). Although Jews were able to make insurance claims for their property losses, [[Hermann Göring]], in charge of German economic planning, ruled that the claims would not be paid in this instance. These events shocked and horrified world opinion and helped bring to an end the climate of support for [[appeasement]] of Hitler in Britain, France and the United States. They also caused a new wave of Jewish emigration from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Sir Martin. ''Kristallnacht: Prelude to Disaster'', HarperCollins (2006) {{ISBN|0-00719-240-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grynszpan felt distraught when he learned that his action was used by the Nazis as a 'justification' for further violent assaults on the German Jews (although his own family, having already been deported to the Polish border, was safe from this particular manifestation of Nazi anti-Semitism). The assassination of vom Rath was used as a pretext for the launch of the pogrom. The Nazi government had been planning violence against the Jews for some time and it was waiting for an appropriate pretext.&lt;ref&gt;Saul Friedländer. ''Nazi Germany and the Jews'', Volume 1 ''The Years of Persecution 1933–1939'', Phoenix, London. 1997, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grynszpan's defence==
[[File:Herschel Grynszpan nov 7 1938.jpg|thumb|Grynszpan after he was arrested by French police]]
The death of vom Rath and the horrors of the ''Kristallnacht'' pogrom brought Herschel Grynszpan international notoriety. Grynszpan enjoyed the celebrity status that killing Rath brought him, and from his prison cell, he basked in the media spotlight, giving frequent interviews with journalists and writing letters to famous people around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitteroth, Linda &amp; Rosteck, Mary Kay ''People of the Holocaust'', U-X-L: Detroit, 1998 page 202&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November, [[Dorothy Thompson]], who in 1934 had become the first American journalist to be expelled from Nazi Germany, made an impassioned broadcast to an estimated 5 million listeners in defence of Grynszpan, pointing out that the Nazis themselves had made heroes of the assassins of Austrian Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and German Foreign Minister [[Walther Rathenau]].

{{quote|I am speaking of this boy [she said]. Soon he will go on trial. The news is that on top of all this terror, this horror, one more must pay. They say he will go to the guillotine, without a trial by jury, with the rights that any common murderer has... Who is on trial in this case? I say we are all on trial. I say the men of Munich are on trial, who signed a pact without one word of protection for helpless minorities. Whether Herschel Grynszpan lives or not won't matter much to Herschel. He was prepared to die when he fired those shots. His young life was already ruined. Since then, his heart has been broken into bits by the results of his deed.

They say a man is entitled to a trial by a jury of his peers, and a man's kinsmen rally around him, when he is in trouble. But no kinsman of Herschel's can defend him. The Nazi government has announced that if any Jews, anywhere in the world, protest at anything that is happening, further oppressive measures will be taken. They are holding every Jew in Germany as a hostage. Therefore, we who are not Jews must speak, speak our sorrow and indignation and disgust in so many voices that they will be heard. This boy has become a symbol, and the responsibility for his deed must be shared by those who caused it. {{sfn|Schwab|1990|p=36}} }}

Liberal and left-wing newspapers and commentators in many countries echoed her sentiments. While deploring the assassination, they argued that Grynszpan had been driven to his act by the Nazi persecution of German Jews in general and the persecution of his family in particular. Jewish organizations were horrified by Grynszpan's action, which they condemned more severely than most non-Jewish liberals, while echoing the plea of extenuating circumstances, and condemning the subsequent victimization of all German Jews in response to the act of an isolated individual. The [[World Jewish Congress]] "deplored the fatal shooting of an official of the German Embassy by a young Polish Jew of seventeen", but "protested energetically against the violent attacks in the German press against the whole of Judaism because of this act" and especially against the "reprisals taken against the German Jews." In France The [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] "rejected all forms of violence, regardless of author or victim", but "indignantly protested against the barbarous treatment inflicted on an entire innocent population."{{sfn|Schwab|1990|p=41}}

Several appeals were launched to raise money for Grynszpan's defence. In the U.S., Thompson launched an appeal which raised more than $40,000 in a few weeks: she asked that Jews not donate to the fund, so that the Nazis could not attribute Grynszpan's defence to a Jewish conspiracy. Jewish organizations also raised money. In the immediate aftermath of the assassination, two Paris Jewish lawyers, Szwarc and Vésinne-Larue, were engaged by the Grynszpan family. Once the case became internationally known the family sought a well-known lawyer and retained [[Isidore Franckel]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Franckel.com/ Isidore Franckel]&lt;/ref&gt; one of Paris's leading advocates and President of the Central Committee of the Alliance of Revisionist Zionists, also known as [[Hatzohar]].

Isidore Franckel wanted a well-known but non-Jewish lawyer as co-counsel and he engaged [[Vincent de Moro-Giafferi]], a flamboyant [[Corsica]]n, leading anti-fascist activist, and a former Education Minister in the [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical]] government of [[Édouard Herriot]], and a Yiddish-speaking lawyer, Serge Weill-Goudchaux, as his associate. Legal fees and costs were paid from Thompson's fundraising for Grynszpan's defence. Until Franckel and Moro-Giafferi took over the defence, everybody had accepted the fact that Grynszpan went to the Embassy in a rage and shot the first German he saw, as a political act in order to avenge the persecution of his family in particular and German Jews in general. Grynszpan's own statements after his arrest supported this: he told the Paris police: "Being a Jew is not a crime. I am not a dog. I have a right to live and the Jewish people have a right to exist on this earth. Wherever I have been, I have been chased like an animal."&lt;ref name="Steinweis pages 471-488"/&gt; Franckel and Moro-Giafferi, however, took the view that if Grynszpan was allowed to claim that he had shot vom Rath with such a motive, this would result in his certain conviction and possibly take him to the [[guillotine]] (despite his being a minor), since French law took a severe view of political assassination. If, on the other hand, the crime could be shown to have had a non-political motive, this might lead to an acquittal, or at least to a lesser sentence, since French law traditionally took a lenient view of the ''[[Crime of passion|crime passionel]]'' (crime of passion). Moro-Gaifferi's legal strategy was thus to "depoliticize" Grynszpan's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, Gerald ''The Day the Holocaust Began'', New York: Praeger, 1990 page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Grynszpan himself was enraged by Moro-Giafferi's proposed homosexual ''crime passionel'' defense, insisting vehemently that he was not gay, and that he had killed Rath as an act of political protest against the anti-Semitic policies of the German government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==The homosexual theory==
A theory that Grynszpan was acquainted with [[Ernst vom Rath]] prior to the shooting has been circulated. According to this theory, vom Rath was [[homosexual]], and he had met Grynszpan in a Paris bar, [[Le Boeuf sur le Toit (cabaret)|Le Boeuf sur le Toit]]. It is not clear whether Grynszpan was himself alleged to be homosexual, or whether he was said to be using his youth and appearance to win an influential friend. According to this theory, vom Rath had promised to use his influence to get Grynszpan's position in France regularized. When vom Rath reneged on this promise, Grynszpan went to the Embassy and shot him. In support of the theory, [[Hans-Jürgen Döscher]], a leading German authority on the period and author of ''Reichskristallnacht'', published documents in 2001 which he said showed that Grynszpan and vom Rath had had a sexual relationship. Döscher quoted extracts from the diary of French author [[André Gide]], himself homosexual and well-informed regarding Parisian gay gossip. Vom Rath, Gide supposedly wrote, "had an exceptionally intimate relationship with the little Jew, his murderer"; and further: "The idea that such a highly thought-of representative of the [[Third Reich]] sinned twice according to the laws of his country is rather amusing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Corinne Chaponnière]], a Swiss researcher, has lately shown that this quotation is wrongly attributed to André Gide. It is his close friend and neighbour Maria Van Rysselberghe who quotes information that their common friend Jean Schlumberger has brought home in December 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Corinne Chaponnière, Les quatre  coups de la Nuit de cristal, L'affaire Grynszpan-vom Rath, Albin Michel, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

There are arguments against the theory that vom Rath had a sexual relationship with Grynszpan. There is no evidence that they had ever met other than second-hand gossip of the type recorded by Maria Van Rysselberghe. The officials at the German Embassy were clear that Grynszpan had not asked to see vom Rath by name, and that he saw vom Rath only because he happened to be on duty at the time Grynszpan visited the Embassy, and because the desk clerk asked vom Rath to see Grynszpan. While interned in the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] in 1941, Grynszpan told fellow inmates that he was intending to claim at his trial that he had engaged in homosexual relations with vom Rath, but he then said that this was not true.{{sfn|Schwab|1990|p=183}} [[Michael Marrus]], a post-war historian, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The origin of the story of homosexuality was the defendant's French attorney, Maitre [[Vincent de Moro-Giafferi|Moro-Giafferi]]. He claimed in 1947 that he simply invented the story as a possible line of defence, one that would put the affair in an entirely new light. In fact, however, rumors about vom Rath's homosexuality were in the air in Paris immediately after the assassination. Whatever the origins of the story, its utility was obvious: the murder could be presented not as a political act but as a ''crime passionel'' &amp;ndash; a lover's quarrel, in which the German diplomat could be judged incidentally as having seduced a minor. Moro-Giafferi shared the fears of the Grynszpan committee at the time of ''Kristallnacht'' that a political trial would be a catastrophe for the Jews of Germany and elsewhere. By adopting this legal strategy, they hoped to defuse the affair and also reduce the penalty drastically, possible even prompting a suspended sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Marrus]], "The Strange Story of Herschel Grynszpan", ''American Scholar'', Winter 1988, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Further evidence is presented by Gerald Schwab in the form of a letter, sent to Ernst vom Rath's brother in 1964 by Erich Wollenberg, a [[communist]] exile from Nazi Germany who claimed to be an associate of Moro-Giafferi:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One day, and unless I am mistaken it was in the spring of 1939, I met Moro-Giafferi on Boulevard St. Michel, and I asked him for news of Grunspahn{{sic}} for whom he was the defence lawyer. He had just come from visiting him in his cell, and was revolted by the attitude of his client. "That young man is a fool, infatuated with himself", he said. "He refuses to give a non-political character to his act by saying for example that he assassinated vom Rath because he had had money quarrels with him following homosexual relations. Yet, such an attitude in regard to the murder of vom Rath is necessary, in order to save the Jews of the Third Reich, whose lives are becoming more and more precarious in regard to the prosperity, their health, their futures, etc. If only ... he would deny the political motives of his crime, and assert that he had only personal vengeance in mind, vengeance as a victim of homosexuality, the Nazis would lose their best pretext for exercising their reprisals against the German Jews who are victims of his fit of madness and now, of his obstinacy." I asked him if Grunspahn really had had relations with vom Rath. He replied, "Absolutely not!" I said to him then, "But as a defender of Gruhnspahn [sic] shouldn't you protect not only the interests of your client, but his honour as well?" It was at that moment that Moro-Giafferi exclaimed, "Honour! Honour! What is the honour of that absurd little Jew in the face of the criminal action of Hitler? What does the honour of Grunspahn [sic] weigh in the face of the destiny of thousands of Jews?"&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, Gerald ''The Day the Holocaust Began'', New York: Praeger, 1990 page 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the eve of the 75th anniversary of [[Kristallnacht]] (November 2013), Dutch author Sidney Smeets published a book based on previously inaccessible archival sources. The book ''De wanhoopsdaad: hoe een zeventienjarige jongen de Kristallnacht ontketende'' (''An Act of Desperation'') delves into the court files regarding German journalist [[Michael Soltikow]]'s ([[:de:Michael Graf Soltikow|de]]) defamation-trials in the 1950s-60s. Soltikow was sued by Vom Rath's surviving brother in 1952 for libeling the deceased's name. New research reveals that the 'evidence' Soltikow presented to support his claims of a homosexual relationship between Vom Rath and Grynszpan did not stand up in a court of law. All witnesses, even those quoted to the contrary by Soltikow, under oath denied any knowledge of the alleged affair. Subsequently the author argues that Döscher's argument is untenable as he based it almost entirely on Soltikow's allegations. The book concludes Grynszpan and Vom Rath did not know each other and that there is no evidence either was homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Smeets. [http://www.dewanhoopsdaad.com/english ''De wanhoopsdaad: hoe een zeventienjarige jongen de Kristallnacht ontketende''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205080854/http://www.dewanhoopsdaad.com/english |date=5 February 2015 }}, Balans, Amsterdam, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the claim of homosexuality proved very damaging to Grynszpan's reputation. American journalist Jonathan Mark (who believed in the theory of the Rath-Grynszpan relationship) wrote in 2010: "I guarantee you, if everything about Grynszpan's case was the same, except that he slept with Anne Frank, or some other nice Jewish girl, instead of Ernst vom Rath, he'd be the subject of symposiums and seminars every Kristallnacht and Yom HaShoah, too, and day school lesson-plans, and there'd be floats in his honor at the Salute to Israel Parade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Paris to Berlin==
From November 1938 to June 1940, Grynszpan was imprisoned in the [[Fresnes Prison]] in Paris while legal arguments continued over the conduct of his trial. He was in Nazi hands as he was illegally [[Extradition|extradited]] to Germany on 18 July 1940, and was being interrogated by the Gestapo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.auschwitz.dk/Grynszpan.htm|title=Herschel Grynszpan|website=www.auschwitz.dk|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defence sought to delay the trial as long as possible by making procedural difficulties, in the hope that the publicity surrounding the vom Rath murder would quiet down and the trial would be less politicized, but the prosecution was also in no hurry. Goebbels sent Wolfgang Diewerge, a lawyer and a journalist who had joined the NSDAP in 1930 to represent the German government in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Steinweis, Alan "The Trials of Herschel Grynszpan: Anti-Jewish Policy and German Propaganda, 1938-1942" pages 471-488 from ''German Studies Review'', Volume 31, Issue #3, October 2008 page 474.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent German lawyer and a professor of international law at the [[University of Münster]], Friedrich Grimm, was also sent to Paris, supposedly representing the vom Rath family, but in fact was widely known to be an agent of Goebbels.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Steinweis, Alan "The Trials of Herschel Grynszpan: Anti-Jewish Policy and German Propaganda, 1938-1942" pages 471-488 from ''German Studies Review'', Volume 31, Issue #3, October 2008 page 476&lt;/ref&gt; Grimm tried to argue that Grynszpan should be extradited to Germany, even though he was not a German citizen &amp;ndash; there was no way the French government could agree to this. Grimn and Diewerge knew each other well, having worked closely together in the "Cairo Jew Trial" of 1934, and in many ways their efforts in [[Paris]] in 1938-39 was a repeat of their work in [[Cairo]] in 1934.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Germans argued that Grynszpan had acted as the agent of a Jewish conspiracy, and their fruitless efforts to find evidence to support this contention further delayed the trial. Grimn and Diewerge, who were both fanatical anti-Semites, were obsessed by the belief that Grynszpan had acted on behalf of unknown Jewish "''Hintermänner''" ("backers") who were also responsible for the assassination of [[Wilhelm Gustloff]] by [[David Frankfurter]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Steinweis, Alan "The Trials of Herschel Grynszpan: Anti-Jewish Policy and German Propaganda, 1938-1942" pages 471-488 from ''German Studies Review'', Volume 31, Issue #3, October 2008 pages 476-477&lt;/ref&gt; Their attempts to find the "''Hintermänner''" and to link Grynszpan to Frankfurter served to slow down the case, not the least because neither man would accept the contention of the Paris police that the "''Hintermänner''" did not exist and there was no connection between the killings of Rath and Gustloff.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Steinweis, Alan "The Trials of Herschel Grynszpan: Anti-Jewish Policy and German Propaganda, 1938-1942" pages 471-488 from ''German Studies Review'', Volume 31, Issue #3, October 2008 page 477&lt;/ref&gt; The American historian Alan Steinweis sarcastically commented that the complete lack of any evidence for the existence of the Jewish "''Hintermänner'' did not lead either Grimn and Diewerge to the conclusion that the ''Hintermänner'' did not in fact exist, but rather to the conclusion that the Jewish conspiracy against Germany was far more insidious than either had realized as the ''Hintermänner'' had managed to erase all evidence of their existence."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939 made it impossible for the Germans to participate further directly as their country was now at war with France (although they engaged a Swiss lawyer to represent their interests), and also causing the French authorities to lose interest in prosecuting Grynszpan{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}{{clarify|date=November 2013}}. Grynszpan applied for release from detention so that he could join the [[French Foreign Legion]], but this was refused. {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Once war broke out, Moro-Giafferi changed tactics and demanded an immediate trial, confident that the anti-German mood, and the inability of the Germans to present evidence, would result in Grynszpan's acquittal. But the investigating judge had joined the army, the Ministry of Justice did not want the trial to proceed, and the Swiss lawyer engaged by the Germans employed various delaying tactics. As a result, there was no trial, and Grynszpan was still in prison when the invading German Army approached Paris in June 1940. The French authorities evacuated the inhabitants of the Paris prisons to the south in early June. Grynszpan was sent first to [[Orléans]], from where he was sent by bus to the prison at [[Bourges]]. En route, however, the convoy was attacked by German aircraft. Some prisoners were killed, while others escaped in the confusion. One of these was apparently Grynszpan, since he was not among the survivors who arrived in Bourges. But Grynszpan had not escaped; he had merely been left behind. Remarkably, instead of making good his escape, he walked to Bourges and turned himself in to the police. From Bourges he was sent to make his own way to [[Toulouse]]. Presumably the French expected him to disappear, but he duly presented himself at the prison in Toulouse and was incarcerated. Grynszpan had no money, knew no one in France, and spoke little French. Apparently he believed he would be safer in a French prison than wandering the countryside. {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The Nazis, however, were on Grynszpan's trail. Grimm, by now an official of the German Foreign Ministry, and SS Sturmbannführer [[Karl Bömelburg]] arrived in Paris on 15 June with orders to find Grynszpan. They followed him to Orléans, then to Bourges, where they learned that he had been sent to Toulouse, which was in the Unoccupied Zone run by the authorities of [[Vichy France]]. France had surrendered on 22 June, and one of the terms of the armistice gave the Germans the right to demand that France surrender all "Germans named by the German Government" to the German occupation authorities. Although Grynszpan was not a German citizen, Germany had been his last place of legal residence, and the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] authorities made no objection to Grimm's formal demand that he be handed over. On 18 July, Grynszpan was delivered to Bömelburg at the border of the Occupied Zone. He was driven back to Paris, flown to Berlin, and locked up in the [[Gestapo]]'s headquarters on [[Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse]].{{sfn|Schwab|1990|p=131}}

==Legal maneuvers in Germany==
Grynszpan spent the remainder of his life in German custody, being shuttled between [[Moabit]] Prison in Berlin and the [[concentration camp]]s at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] and [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]]. At Sachsenhausen he was housed in the "bunker" reserved for "special prisoners" &amp;ndash; he shared it with the last pre-[[Anschluss]] [[Chancellor of Austria]], [[Kurt Schuschnigg]]. He received comparatively mild treatment because Goebbels intended that Grynszpan be the subject of a propaganda [[show trial]], to prove the complicity of "international Jewry" in the vom Rath killing. Grimm and an official of Goebbels's ministry, Wolfgang Diewerge, were put in charge of the preparations, using the files which had been seized from Moro-Giafferi's offices in Paris (Moro-Giafferi himself had escaped to Switzerland).{{sfn|Schwab|1990|p=131}}

Goebbels, however, found it just as difficult to bring Grynszpan to trial in Germany as he had done in France. The Nazis held unchallenged political power, but the state bureaucracy retained its independence in many areas (and in fact harboured the most effective networks of the [[German Resistance]]). The Justice Ministry, still staffed by lawyers concerned to uphold the letter of the law, argued correctly that since Grynszpan was not a German citizen, he could not be tried in Germany for a murder he had committed outside Germany, and since he had been a minor at the time he could not face the [[death penalty]]. These arguments dragged on through 1940 and into 1941. The solution was to charge Grynszpan with high [[treason]], for which he could be legally tried and executed if convicted. It took some time to persuade everyone concerned of the "legality" of this, and it was not until October 1941 that he was formally [[indictment|indicted]]. The indictment argued that Grynszpan's objective in shooting vom Rath had been to "prevent through force of threats the Führer and Reichschancellor from the conduct of their constitutional functions" at the behest of international Jewry.{{sfn|Schwab|1990|p=133}} In November Goebbels saw Hitler and gained his approval for a show trial that would put "World Jewry in the dock". The trial was set for January 1942. It was arranged for the former French Foreign Minister [[Georges Bonnet]] to testify that "World Jewry" had been responsible for dragging France into a war with Germany. This was the political objective of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Steinweis, Alan The Trials of Herschel Grynszpan: Anti-Jewish Policy and German Propaganda, 1938-1942 pages 471-488 from ''German Studies Review'', Volume 31, Issue #3, October 2008 page 480&lt;/ref&gt;

January 1942 came, however, and the trial did not take place. This was partly because of more momentous events. The [[United States]] had entered the war in December, the same month that the German armies had suffered a major setback on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] before battling the Soviets near Moscow. In February the [[Riom Trial]] of [[Léon Blum]] and other French politicians was due to begin &amp;ndash; Goebbels did not want two show trials at once. It was partly also because of further legal difficulties. It was feared that Grynszpan would challenge the legality of his deportation from France, which the Justice Ministry officials felt had been "irregular". Most disturbing of all, however, was the revelation that Grynszpan would claim that he had shot vom Rath because he had had homosexual relations with him. This was communicated to Grimm, Diewerge, and other officials by [[Roland Freisler]], later the head of the People's Court, but at this time State Secretary of the Justice Ministry, on 22 January. Apparently Grynszpan, having rejected the idea of using this line of defence when Moro-Giafferi had thought of it in 1938, had decided that it was worth a try. He had told one of his Gestapo interrogators, Dr. Heinrich Jagusch, that he intended using this defence as long ago as mid-1941, but the Justice Ministry had not informed Goebbels, who was furious. He wrote in his diary:

{{quote|Grynszpan has invented the insolent argument that he had a homosexual relationship with... vom Rath. That is, of course, a shameless lie; however it is thought out very cleverly and would, if brought out in the course of a public trial, certainly become the main argument of enemy propaganda. {{sfn|Schwab|1990|p=142}} }}

The Justice Ministry reacted to this claim by indicting Grynszpan under [[Paragraph 175]], an act that infuriated Goebbels who argued that this additional indictment implied there was something to the claim of a homosexual relationship between Grynszpan and Rath.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Steinweis, Alan The Trials of Herschel Grynszpan: Anti-Jewish Policy and German Propaganda, 1938-1942 pages 471-488 from ''German Studies Review'', Volume 31, Issue #3, October 2008 page 483.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March Goebbels again saw Hitler, and assured him that the trial would get under way in May. He did not, however, warn Hitler of the problem of the possibility that Grynszpan might claim that he had had homosexual relations with vom Rath. In April he was still grappling with the problem. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am having lots of work preparing the Grynszpan trial. The Ministry of Justice has deemed it proper to furnish the defendant, the Jew Grynszpan, the argument of Article 175 [the German law against homosexuality]. Grynszpan until now has always claimed, and rightly so, that he had not even known the Counsellor of the Legation whom he shot. Now there is in existence some sort of anonymous letter by a Jewish refugee, which leaves open the likelihood of homosexual intercourse between Grynszpan and vom Rath. It is an absurd, typically Jewish, claim. The Ministry of Justice, however, did not hesitate to incorporate this claim in the indictment and to send the indictment to the defendant. This shows again how foolishly our legal experts have acted in this case, and how shortsighted it is to entrust any political matter whatever to the jurists.{{sfn|Schwab|1990|p=169}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 10 April the acting Justice Minister, [[Franz Schlegelberger]], wrote to Goebbels demanding to know whether Hitler, when he had authorized the trial, had been aware that Grynszpan was planning to use the "homosexual defence". The issue that was troubling the Justice Ministry was not the allegation that vom Rath had had a sexual relationship with Grynszpan &amp;ndash; they knew that to be false, and in fact they knew Grynszpan had told some of his fellow prisoners at Sachsenhausen that it was false. The problem was their belief that vom Rath had in fact been homosexual, that Grynszpan knew details of this (these had been given to him by Moro-Giafferi in Paris), and that he would reveal them in court. This would embarrass both the vom Rath family and the Foreign Ministry. It was also learned that vom Rath's brother Gustav, a Wehrmacht officer had been convicted by a court-martial for homosexuality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The fact that Gustav vom Rath was gay suggested the possibility that Ernst vom Rath may have also been gay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

[[File:Stolperstein Grünspan verlegt.jpg|thumb|Memorial for Herschel and his sister, Esther, at their last place of residence in Hanover.]]
Soon after this, Hitler was made aware of the problem &amp;ndash; by whom it is not clear, but it is probable that the matter had reached the ears of [[Martin Bormann]], head of the [[Party Chancellery]] and Hitler's private secretary, who thought it his duty to inform Hitler that Goebbels had not told him the whole truth about the Grynszpan case. It is probably not coincidental that the Riom Trial was called off on 4 April, after Blum and the other defendants had used it as a platform to attack the Vichy regime. This no doubt helped influence Hitler against a further risky show trial.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In any event, by the beginning of May 1942 it was clear to all that Hitler did not favour a trial. The matter was raised on and off for several months more, but without Hitler's approval there could be no progress. In recognition of this, Grynszpan was moved in September to the prison at [[Magdeburg]]. Grynszpan's fate after September 1942 is not known. Since his trial was never actually called off, merely postponed indefinitely, he was probably intended to be kept alive in case circumstances changed and a trial became possible. He may still have been alive in late 1943 or early 1944, according to [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s recollection, at Gestapo headquarters in Berlin.

Despite not knowing what he looked like, [[Adolf Eichmann]] believed he inspected Grynszpan in 1943 or 1944 according to Eichmann's own testimony at his trial in 1961, although Eichmann said he neither remembered nor knew what happened to him in the end.&lt;ref name="Nizkor"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Trial of Adolf Eichmann |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/Sessions/Session-011-03.html |publisher=[[The Nizkor Project]] |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I received an order that Grynszpan was in custody in [[Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse]] 8, and he had to be further examined concerning who was likely to have been behind the scenes. Accordingly I gave instructions to bring Grynszpan no, not this way &amp;ndash; accordingly Krischak gave orders &amp;ndash; Krischak was dealing with the matter &amp;ndash; to bring Grynszpan and...either way it would have been useless, I said to myself. I still remember exactly, for I was curious to see what Grynszpan looked like.

Nothing, obviously, emerged from the whole thing and I merely said then to Krischak that if he had completed the interrogation, I wanted him to bring him to me upstairs, for I very much wanted &amp;ndash; for once &amp;ndash; to look at the man Grynszpan. I wanted to talk to him. And I did then, exchange a few words with Grynszpan. [...] I don't know what...what happened to him. I did not hear anything more. I didn't hear anything more about it.&lt;ref name="Nizkor"/&gt;}}

==The fate of Grynszpan and his rumoured survival==
Grynszpan's precise fate is unknown.

One report said that he was executed in 1940, while Fritz Dahms, an official in the German Foreign Office, stated that he had died just before the end of the war. There were frequent rumors after the war that he had survived and was living under another name in Paris, but there is no evidence to support them.&lt;ref name="Roizen"&gt;{{cite web

In April 1952, Michael von Soltikow, a German journalist and a former ardent National Socialist during the era of the Third Reich, published two articles claiming that Grynszpan was living in Paris, and he repeated the gay lover theory surrounding Rath's killing.&lt;ref name="Roizen" /&gt; Graf von Soltikow as he liked to call himself (his real name was Walter Bennecke and he was not an aristocrat) was a self-promoting former SS officer who had specialized in writing anti-Semitic tracts during the era of the Third Reich, and after the war he engaged in much sensationalist journalism, usually with the claim that he was boldly revealing "secrets" that no one else dared to mention.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsch, Jonathan ''The Short, Strange Life of Herschel Grynszpan'', New York: W.W. Norton pages 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt; Soltikow professed that he was doing a service to "World Jewry" by "proving" that Grynszpan had killed Rath as the result of a homosexual relationship gone bad rather than as the product of a world Jewish conspiracy.&lt;ref name="Roizen" /&gt;

Likewise, the theory that Grynszpan was living in Paris and was not being prosecuted for the murder of Rath despite the overwhelming evidence of his guilt would have been attractive to many Germans after the war. In the 1950s, there were thousands of Germans who had been involved in the Holocaust who had not been prosecuted for their crimes and were being allowed to live out their days in peace. The German historian [[Wolfram Wette]] wrote in 2002 that in the 1950s "the vast majority of the population retained the nationalistic attitudes that had been inculcated in them earlier. Not only did they not accept the verdict that war crimes had been committed, but they also expressed solidarity with those who had been convicted, protected them and demanded their release, preferably in the form of a general amnesty".&lt;ref&gt;Wette, Wolfram ''The Wehrmacht'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2006 page 239&lt;/ref&gt; That the Jew who had murdered a German was not prosecuted for his crime by the French despite that he was supposedly living openly in Paris was used as argument for not prosecuting those Germans who had been involved in the murder of Jews during the ''Shoah''.

After publishing his articles, Soltikow was sued for defamation by the vom Rath family. In 2013, the Dutch historian Sidney Smeets called Solitkow a "con-man" whose statements about Grynszpan and Rath were all lies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his trial in Munich, Soltikow claimed that Grynszpan was present during the previous day's court proceedings, watching the trial as a spectator.&lt;ref name="Roizen" /&gt; When the judge stated if that were the case, then Grynszpan would have to be arrested for Rath's murder, an angry Soltikow claimed that Grynszpan would never show his face again.&lt;ref name="Roizen" /&gt;

In 1957 an article written by the German historian Helmut Heiber claimed that he was sent to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] and survived the war, while another one by Egon Larsen published two years later argued that Grynszpan had changed his name and was living in Paris and working as a garage mechanic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herschel Grynszpan|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERgrynszpan.htm|work=[[Spartacus Educational]]|accessdate=15 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222214143/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERgrynszpan.htm|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heiber's article was revealed to be based entirely upon various rumors that he claimed to have heard that Grynszpan was alive and well, living in Paris while Larsen's report was likewise based on talks with people who claimed in their turn to have met people who knew Grynszpan was living in Paris; despite their claims of Grynszpan's survival, no one had ever actually seen Grynszpan in the flesh.&lt;ref name="Roizen" /&gt; The only person who claimed to have seen Grynszpan was the shady character Soltikow while everyone else claimed to have talked with other people who supposedly met Grynszpan.&lt;ref name="Roizen" /&gt; In 1981, Heiber retracted his article of 1957, stating he now believed that Grynszpan had died during the war.&lt;ref name="Roizen" /&gt;

The French doctor Alain Cuenot who carried out the most complete search for Grynszpan in the late 1950s reported that not only could he find no evidence that Grynszpan was alive, but that he found no references to Grynszpan in the German documents after 1942, which strongly suggested that Grynszpan had died that year.&lt;ref name="Roizen" /&gt; Dr. Cuenot wrote: "If Grynszpan had survived the years 1943, 1944 and 1945, it would seem quite unusual that documents would not have been added to those already gathered".&lt;ref name="Roizen" /&gt; Cuenot further noted that because of the poor living conditions that the inmates of Sachsenhausen were forced to live under, epidemics of various diseases regularly killed thousands of inmates at Sachsenhausen. Cuenot speculated that it was quite possible that Grynszpan had died in one of those epidemics, and that because Grynszpan was supposed to be kept alive to be tried one day, that the SS camp officers would have a vested interest in covering up his death.&lt;ref name="Roizen" /&gt;

By contrast, the American historian [[Alan E. Steinweis]] wrote that Grynszpan was executed by the SS in 1942 when it become clear that he would not be tried after all for the murder of vom Rath.&lt;ref&gt;Steinweis, Alan "The Trials of Herschel Grynszpan: Anti-Jewish Policy and German Propaganda, 1938-1942" pages 471-488 from ''German Studies Review'', Volume 31, Issue #3, October 2008 page 484.&lt;/ref&gt; Grynszpan was declared legally dead by the West German government in 1960 with the date of death being fixed as {{death date|1945|5|8}}, at the request of his parents who declared that they had heard nothing from him since the war.&lt;ref name="Roizen" /&gt; Given that Grynszpan was extremely close to his parents and siblings (indeed had been moved to assassinate vom Rath out of outrage at their treatment), it is highly unlikely that Grynszpan would have not contacted his parents or his brother if he were alive after the war. During his two years living in Paris between 1936 to 1938, the lonely Grynszpan had written frequently to his family in Hanover, declaring how much he missed them and how he desperately wanted to see them again.&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite web

His parents, having sent him to "safety" in Paris while they and his siblings stayed in Germany, survived the war. Having been deported to Poland, they escaped in 1939 to the Soviet Union, where his sister, Esther, was murdered in 1942.

After the war the remaining family members immigrated to the [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine Mandate]], which became [[Israel]]. Sendel Grynszpan, Herschel's father, was present at the Israeli premiere in 1952 of Sir [[Michael Tippett]]'s [[oratorio]] about Herschel Grynszpan, ''[[A Child of Our Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Roizen. [http://www.roizen.com/ron/grynszpan.htm "Herschel Grynszpan: the fate of a forgotten assassin"], ''[[Holocaust and Genocide Studies]]'', Vol 1 No 2, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

In his own lifetime, Grynszpan was a figure widely shunned by Jewish communities around the world who viewed him as an irresponsible, immature teenager who by recklessly killing a minor official like vom Rath brought down the wrath of the Nazis in the form of the ''Kristallnacht''.&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt; Writer Ron Roizen suggested that the frequent claims of Grynszpan's survival despite all of the evidence suggesting that he died sometime in late 1942 reflected a bad conscience on the part of those Jews who shunned Grynszpan during his lifetime, because his "abandonment seems a little less problematic, too, once it is believed that the boy miraculously survived the war. Grynszpan alive permits us to avoid more easily the painful moral issues his case so profoundly symbolizes. Was Grynszpan's action that of a heroic martyr or a misguided pariah? Were the reactions to Grynszpan's action among those for whom it was carried out appropriate or inappropriate? Though nearly a half century has passed since Herschel Grynszpan's assassination of Ernst vom Rath, little or no progress has been made on these painful questions."&lt;ref name="Roizen" /&gt;

=== Purported 1946 photo ===
In December 2016, a photograph discovered in the archives of Vienna's Jewish Museum led some people to suggest that Grynszpan could have survived the war. The photograph was taken at a [[displaced persons camp]] in  [[Bamberg]], [[Germany]], on 3 July 1946. The photograph shows a man who resembles Grynszpan participating in a demonstration of Holocaust survivors against the British authorities' refusal to let them emigrate to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British mandate of Palestine.]] A facial recognition test showed a 95% chance that the photo was of Grynszpan, the highest possible outcome.&lt;ref name="Guardian - 18-12-2016" /&gt;

'''''Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada''''', 542 U.S. 177 (2004), is a [[United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that statutes requiring suspects to disclose their names during a police [[Terry stop]] did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] ''if'' the statute first required reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal involvement. Under the rubric of ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|392|1|1968}}, the minimal intrusion on a suspect's privacy, and the legitimate need of law enforcement officers to quickly dispel suspicion that an individual is engaged in criminal activity, justified requiring a suspect to disclose his or her name.

The Court also held that the identification requirement did not violate Hiibel's [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights because he had no reasonable belief that his name would be used to incriminate him; however, the Court left open the possibility that Fifth Amendment privilege might apply in a situation where there ''was'' a reasonable belief that giving a name could be incriminating.&lt;ref name="FifthAmendmentHolding"&gt;
In upholding Hiibel′s conviction, the Court noted
:"In this case petitioner's refusal to disclose his name was not based on any articulated real and appreciable fear that his name would be used to incriminate him.... As best we can tell, petitioner refused to identify himself only because he thought his name was none of the officer's business." {{nowrap|— 542 U.S. 177,}} at 190
But the Court left open the possibility of different circumstances:
:"Still, a case may arise where there is a substantial allegation that furnishing identity at the time of a stop would have given the police a link in the chain of evidence needed to convict the individual of a separate offense. In that case, the court can then consider whether the privilege applies, and, if the Fifth Amendment has been violated, what remedy must follow. We need not resolve those questions here." {{nowrap|— 542 U.S. 177,}} at 191
&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Hiibel'' decision was narrow in that it applied only to states that have [[stop and identify statutes]]. Consequently, individuals in states without such statutes cannot be lawfully arrested solely for refusing to identify themselves during a Terry stop.

== Background of the case ==
Nevada has a "[[Stop and Identify statutes|stop-and-identify]]" law that allows [[police officer]]s to detain any person they encounter "under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the person has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime"; the person may be detained only to "ascertain his identity and the suspicious circumstances surrounding his presence abroad." In turn, the law requires the person detained to "identify himself", but does not compel the person to answer any other questions put to him by the officer. The Nevada Supreme Court has interpreted that "identify himself" to mean to merely state his name. As of April 2008, 23 other states&lt;ref&gt;
See the article [[Stop and identify statutes]] for a list of states with "stop-and-identify" laws.
&lt;/ref&gt; have similar laws.

On the evening of May 21, 2000, the sheriff's department in [[Humboldt County, Nevada]] received a report that a man had assaulted a woman in a red and silver GMC truck on Grass Valley Road. The responding deputy found a truck parked on the side of the road. A man was smoking a cigarette beside the truck, and a young woman was sitting inside it. The deputy observed skid marks in the gravel behind the vehicle, leading him to believe the vehicle had come to a sudden stop.

The deputy explained to the man that there had been a report of a fight between the man and the young woman, and asked the man if he had any identification on him. The man protested that he had no reason to provide identification, and became ill-tempered when the deputy continued to press him for his identification. The man then asked the deputy what crime he was being accused of, as the deputy continued his requests for identification, stating that he was "conducting an investigation". The man persisted in his refusal to provide identification, asking instead to be handcuffed and taken to jail. The deputy continued to ask for the man's identification, stating that the man would face arrest if he did not cooperate and provide identification.&lt;ref&gt;
From the opinion of the Nevada Supreme Court in ''Hiibel v.  Dist. Ct.'', as well as the State of Nevada's brief to the Supreme Court (Brief for Respondent, p. 4), the Court understood the statute to require only that the suspect state his name or communicate it to the officer by other means. The majority opinion noted that Hiibel was asked to provide identification, which the Court understood as a request to produce a driver's license or some other form of written identification, 11 different times; however, it did not indicate that Hiibel was ever asked simply to identify himself. Hiibel did not raise this argument until his petition for rehearing by the Supreme Court (Petition for Rehearing, p. 1).
&lt;/ref&gt;
In response, the man declared he would not cooperate because he had not committed any crime. He then turned around and was arrested by the deputy.

That man was Larry Dudley Hiibel, the petitioner in this case, and the young woman was his daughter Mimi Hiibel. Larry Hiibel was charged with "willfully resist[ing], delay[ing], or obstruct[ing] a public officer in discharging or attempting to discharge any legal duty of his office."&lt;ref&gt;
Nev. Rev. Stat. (NRS) §171.123(3) provides that:
:"The officer may detain the person pursuant to this section only to ascertain his identity and the suspicious circumstances surrounding his presence abroad. Any person so detained shall identify himself, but may not be compelled to answer any other inquiry of any peace officer."
It was determined that by refusing to identify himself, Hiibel violated NRS §199.280, which states:
:"A person who, in any case or under any circumstances not otherwise specially provided for, willfully resists, delays or obstructs a public officer in discharging or attempting to discharge any legal duty of his office shall be punished&amp;nbsp;..."
&lt;/ref&gt; In the Justice Court for Union Township, Nevada, Hiibel was convicted of this charge and fined $250. He appealed to the [[Nevada District Courts|Sixth Judicial District Court]], which affirmed the conviction. He then appealed to the [[Nevada Supreme Court]], arguing that the requirement that he identify himself to any police officer upon request violated the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures and his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights against self-incrimination. The Nevada Supreme Court rejected these arguments, and Hiibel asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.

== Majority opinion ==
Stop-and-identify laws have their roots in early English vagrancy laws under which suspected vagrants were subject to arrest unless they gave a "good account" of themselves; this practice, in turn, derived from the common-law power of any person to arrest suspicious persons and detain them until they gave "a good account" of themselves. Modern stop-and-identify laws combine aspects of the old vagrancy laws with a guide for police officers conducting investigatory stops, such as those authorized under ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|392|1|1968}}.

However, the Court has identified a constitutional difficulty with many modern vagrancy laws. In ''[[Papachristou v. Jacksonville]]'', {{ussc|405|156|1972}}, the Court held that a traditional vagrancy law was void for vagueness because its "broad scope and imprecise terms denied proper notice to potential offenders and permitted police officers to exercise unfettered discretion in the enforcement of the law." In ''[[Brown v. Texas]]'', {{ussc|443|47|1979}}, the Court struck down Texas's stop-and-identify law as violating the Fourth Amendment because it allowed police officers to stop individuals without "specific, objective facts establishing reasonable suspicion to believe the suspect was involved in criminal activity." And in ''[[Kolender v. Lawson]]'', {{ussc|461|352|1983}}, the Court struck down a California stop-and-identify law that required a suspect to provide "credible and reliable identification" upon request.&lt;ref&gt;
The requirement of California Penal Code § 647(e) to provide "credible and reliable identification" derived not from the statutory language but from a construction of the statute given by a California appellate case, ''People v. Solomon'' (1973), 33 Cal.App.3d 429.
In ''Wainwright v. Stone'', {{ussc|414|21|1973}}, the U.S. Supreme Court had held, "For the purpose of determining whether a state statute is too vague and indefinite to constitute valid legislation 'we must take the statute as though it read precisely as the highest court of the State has interpreted it.{{'"}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The words "credible and reliable" were vague because they "provided no standard for determining what a suspect must do to comply with [the law], resulting in virtually unrestrained power to arrest and charge persons with a violation."

"The present case begins where our prior cases left off.  Here there is no question that the initial stop was based on reasonable suspicion, satisfying the Fourth Amendment requirements noted in ''Brown''.  Further, the petitioner has not alleged that the statute is unconstitutionally vague, as in ''Kolender''.  Here the Nevada statute is narrower and precise."  The Nevada Supreme Court had held that the Nevada statute required only that the suspect divulge his name; presumably, he could do so without handing over any documents whatsoever.  As long as the suspect tells the officer his name, he has satisfied the dictates of the Nevada stop-and-identify law.

The narrow requirements of Nevada's stop-and-identify law meant that it did not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment.  "In the ordinary course a police officer is free to ask a person for identification without implicating the Fourth Amendment."  Since ''Terry'', it has been clear that a police officer who reasonably suspects that a person is involved in criminal activity may detain a person long enough to dispel that suspicion.  Questions related to a person's identity are a "routine and accepted part of many ''Terry'' stops."  Knowing a person's identity may, of course, help to clear a suspect and divert the attention of the police to another suspect.  On the other hand, knowing the suspect's name may just as quickly confirm to the officer that the person is wanted for another, unrelated crime.  In cases such as this, where the police are investigating a domestic dispute, officers "need to know whom they are dealing with in order to assess the situation, the threat to their own safety, and possible danger to the potential victim."  "The request for identity has an immediate relation to the purpose, rationale, and practical demands of a ''Terry'' stop.  The threat of criminal sanction helps ensure that the request for identity does not become a legal nullity."  Balancing the intrusion into the individual's privacy against the extent to which the stop-and-identify law promotes legitimate government interests, the Court concluded that the Fourth Amendment did not prohibit Nevada from making it a crime for a person detained under conditions of ''Terry'' to refuse to disclose his name to a police officer upon request.  

Furthermore, the officer's request that Hiibel identify himself did not implicate Hiibel's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  There was no "articulated real and appreciable fear that [Hiibel's] name would be used to incriminate him, or that it 'would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute' him."  Because Hiibel did not articulate reasonable belief that his name could be used as an incriminating piece of evidence, he could not invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege in refusing to disclose it.

== Dissenting opinions ==
Justice Stevens opined that the Court's precedent required it to strike down Nevada's stop-and-identify law.  Under the Court's ''Terry'' jurisprudence, a suspect has always had the right to refuse to answer questions put to him by police officers during a ''Terry'' stop.  And the Fifth Amendment privilege had always attached during custodial interrogations because information extorted by the police during such interrogations is unavoidably testimonial.  Why else would the police ask for a person's name, if not to determine whether that person was either wanted for committing a crime or directly suspected of committing a crime?  "The officer in this case told [Hiibel] that he was conducting an investigation and needed to see some identification.  As the target of that investigation, [Hiibel], in my view, acted well within his rights when he opted to stand mute.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent."

Justice Breyer noted that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;the Court wrote that an 'officer may ask the [''Terry''] detainee a moderate number of questions to determine his identity and to try to obtain information confirming or dispelling the officer's suspicions. ''But the detainee is not obliged to respond''.' ''Berkemer v. McCarty'', {{ussc|468|420|1984}} (emphasis added).... the Court's statement in ''Berkemer'', while technically dicta, is the kind of strong dicta that the legal community typically takes as a statement of the law. And that law has remained undisturbed for more than 20 years.  There is no good reason now to reject this generation-old statement of the law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justice Breyer also expressed a "slippery-slope" concern that the majority's opinion would lead to allowing the police to ask follow-up questions, such as what the person's license number is, or where a person lives, without running afoul of constitutional protections.

}}The [[history]] of the Italian State Police ([[Polizia di Stato]]) began in 1848, continued through the State Police Reform Act of 1981, until today, thus producing more than a century and a half of the institutional history of the men and women who have performed this duty and sometimes gave their lives.

==The nineteenth century: the birth, growth==

The department of the Cavalry of the [[Italian State Police]] inherits a very ancient tradition, dating back to 'the nineteenth century, the predominant use is for law and order patrols and detail the origins of the administration of public security in the modern sense, be traced back to King Carlo Alberto, who formed in 1848 as civil administration. In the reorganization of the Savoy state, the spatial distribution of the forces of military control [2], was joined by a civilian structure composed of delegates from the police. Soon, the peculiar needs of these, together with the observation of what was developing in other states, required the establishment of the armed forces specially dedicated to police functions, preferably released from certain obligations typical of traditional military forces.
[[File:Polizia di Stato horseback parade 2 June 2007.jpg|thumb|Mounted State Police]]

The first corps that gave life to the police at the time were the Municipal Militia and National Guard. Successively, with the law July 11, 1852, and 1404, created the Public Safety Guards, who had two companies at Turin and Genoa (in addition to some stations). The law November 13, 1859, and 3720, it extended the territorial jurisdiction for all states (minus Tuscany), which were gradually annexing the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], the same rule given command of the duties of public security as quaestor of the city capital of the province with over 60,000 inhabitants, and for the first time it was established the role of inspectors.

The Royal Decree of October 9, 1861, n. 255, created the General Directorate of Public Security, thereby increasing temporarily the structure, then grew up to the rank of division, but the 'next year, with the establishment of the Secretariat General of the Interior Ministry, the administration was reduced to the rank Division and placed under the responsibility of the Secretary General. The activities of the Corps were also distinct in 1880, in police administration, police and judicial affairs division reserved.

By Royal Decree of July 3, 1887, n. 4707, the government De Pretis restored the Directorate General. In December 1890 (Interior Minister Francesco Crispi) The union of the Militia and the Municipal Public Security Guards, was born on Guards City.

==The twentieth century==
===Science and politics===
[[File:It police giulia.jpg|thumb|left|The Italian police 1971 [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]] Super, the "Pantera", in the classic green livery, the vehicle and symbol of State Police in the 1960s.]]

In 1902, mainly by Salvatore Ottolenghi, a student of Cesare Lombroso [3], during the Giolitti Government II founded the school of forensic science [4], led by its founder, the same Ottolenghi, first student of the techniques scientific investigation.

In 1917 was instituted the UCI, Central Office investigations, which gathered in part the legacy of the Political Affairs Division confidential and would spent on counterintelligence, and the control was assigned to Gast.

In August 1919, during the Nitti Government II, City Guards were disbanded and were up the body of the Royal Guard of Public Safety (12 divisions with 40,000 men), hand-to-order military deputy to the maintenance of 'public order and quite free from any influence of politics, and the corps of detectives (8,000 men), specializing in the tasks of the judicial police.

===The Fascist Police Scheme===

On December 31, 1922 [[Benito Mussolini]], head of the infant government, led the two bodies (causing violent reactions of some negligence on the part of the troops involved), which were then absorbed into the Army of the Royal [[Carabinieri]]. In the same maneuver, was created the [[Blackshirts|Volunteer Militia for National Security]] or MVSN.
[[File:Polizia di stato jeep.JPG|thumb|A [[Fiat Campagnola|FIAT Campagnola]], the vehicle that replaced the American jeep, beyond the obvious urban use, was used by the [[Celere]] riot police and many other departments.]]

Among the many reasons that have been proposed for this choice, many scholars are inclined to consider it more likely the need for the new chairman of the board to refer to more easily control all the state structures (what would later be most evident when all Fascist governments were organized as a paramilitary): If the troops of the two military police was certainly in the upper part of the chain of command was rather civil, so do not undergo the rigors of the regulations that underlie the men in uniform, first of all precisely the iron chain of command. With the unification of the carabinieri would be easier to control over all the police through the control of the only weapon that Mussolini considered within his reach. The formation of the Militia, due also to [[Dino Grandi]], responded to the need instead to frame forms legally acceptable (as well as smuggled grateful "recognition") the "de facto forces" of the squad.

Nevertheless, the distinction of a special police functions still needed to fascism, but being able to resolve the issue with the centralization of command at the Interior Ministry, which could have the forces of the Ministry of War [5]. The offices of government were therefore maintained direct emanation in place, with even some small operation that showed continued attention. By Royal Decree of November 11, 1923, n. 2395, the figure of the Director General of Public Security was renamed (without other substantive changes) in "General Intendant of Police", by Royal Decree December 20, 1923, n. 2908, which converted the existing anchor name "Chief of Police."

In April 1925 was (re) constitute the body of public security officials, which resumed if only the tradition of the dissolved bodies, in part to regain the consent from the police, far above the melting down (which collaterally had also undermined the internal consistency between the Police, in which they were paid indiscriminately former police officers) and the growth of the power of the militia, in which there were, during the fascism, a number of skills or interference in fact. The reconstitution of the body is reached, however, because the Carabinieri, the most ancient traditions, had remained loyal to the crown and it was argued, the attempt to gain control was stopped before colliding with an unfortunate defeat.

==The Bocchini Era==
In 1926 he was appointed [[Police Chief]] [[Arturo Bocchini]], just days after his appointment was issued the text of the Law of Public Security (TULPS), which regulates in minute detail the daily life so unusual, and shortly after that was established the Special Tribunal (which had as its task the fight against political opponents), and reinstated the death penalty.

[[File:2june 2007 509.jpg|thumb|left|Two Alfa Romeo 159s assigned to the [[Reparto volanti]] (flying squad).]]
Bocchini had always the supreme mission of safeguarding the Duce and in this task he increased the common organizational capacity building in 1930 the [[OVRA]] (Organismo di Vigilanza per la Repressione dell'Antifascismo - Supervisory Body for the Suppression of anti). In addition, he introduced significant changes in the organizational and technical operation of police stations (many of which have not abolished the Republican era), so you can easily set up an impressive collection of data in real time that the Palazzo Venezia was also analyzed to monitor the popular consensus. Among these changes the so-called "morning" bureaucratic relationship with data on present strength and statements of facts (crime, accidents, other events of importance) of the previous day, traditionally the morning is delivered to the recipient (typically the commissioner, but also responsible other commands) just when taking office in the morning, hence the name.

From an operational standpoint, with the conquest of colonies, Bocchini devised a special mini-police force for the new territories, the Colonial Police Corps, later renamed the [[Italian Africa Police]] (PAI) with unusual uniforms and equipment, echoed from the experiences of explorers from England, and fitted with a preview of the newly made [[Beretta Model 38]] [[submachine gun]], characterized by a kind of radiator for cooling the barrel.

Bocchini was a very capable Chief of Police, who managed to run almost single organization soon returned impressive and delicate, a body whose control was obviously essential for the proper keeping of the government and that he himself seems to have wanted to recreate after dissolution of '22, in order to constitute a sort of army to the government (which also had already framed the elements of the militia squads). The police, therefore, was loyal to the government, the Carabinieri the [[King of Italy]], Bocchini was because the real author of a duplication of the national structures of police and military (and intelligence) that best represents the reason for the substantial balance between the Crown and the black fez. In this role, Bocchini was one of the fundamental pillars upon which the edifice of the regime. Bocchini was responsible for conducting the most sensitive profiling of the most prominent of the Italian society of the period, contributing to the creation of the famous "secret archive" of Mussolini. Bocchini was still to return to the Duce personally witnessed a very popular discontent caused by the racial laws.

In this regard, it was among the many dead of Police (through its various denominations), the noble if not unique, Giovanni Palatucci, an official of the Immigration Office, which prevented the deportation of thousands of [[Jews]] and that he was deported and died at [[Mauthausen]].

Bocchini died in circumstances that some have considered "not clear" (not least because very little after the presentation of disclosures in which it warned Mussolini very little consensus on the military and the population faced with the prospect of following the Germany in the war), succeeded Carmine Senise, which some was a man of [[Badoglio]], that the king also Senise, indeed, was aware of the discontent and indeed foresaw the possible dismissal of Mussolini by King, but managed to maintain its appears distinct from the regime.

===The Senise Era and the Police War===

The war led the police to update their purpose of use, to cope with situations of public policy course exceptional. In this, it was noted, the zeal of repression was brought to an end almost physiologically, registering an infinite number of crimes committed with actual causes of severe need, while for political offenses, the jurisdiction was transferred almost entirely to military forces. Much as the recruitment of temporary staff required for military forces to fight.

Senise was replaced in April 1943 on the occasion of a general reshuffling of institutional leaders wanted by Mussolini, this reshuffle (which deprived the crown of a man ever trusted a chair so delicate) was considered by some historians real time when the [[Quirinal]] was decided, approaching Dino Grandi, to get rid of Mussolini. It is true indeed, that after the July 25, Senise was quickly renamed by Badoglio as Chief of Police. It should be mentioned that Senise was one of the few authorities who do not follow the King and Badoglio in his flight to the South after the 'armistice Cassibile and that was why he was arrested in Rome by the Germans (by [[Erich Priebke]]) and was deported to a [[concentration camp]] from which he was released at the end of the war.

===Post Armistice===
On September 6, 1943, when the [[Armistice of Cassibile]] had already been signed in secret, before they were given public notice had been disbanded the militia, returning to the police all its major functions.

On November 2, 1944, a legislative decree Lieutenant of the Realm, was re-imposed the guards, public security, which this time had the status of military force, breaking the tradition that had always seen the police as armed civilian body (except in the short term absorption Carabinieri in war).

The end of the war was preceded and followed by situations of serious hardship administration, unable to fulfill its institutional duties with satisfactory results. The division of the country and the civil war, along with the widespread banditry, prevented to consider Italy a country "safe." In addition, the police under the leadership of Bocchini was very closely linked to governmental affairs, and then not to collect the most appropriate trust. Shortly before the liberation, it was therefore necessary to issue the ban on membership in political parties or trade unions to all members of the Body, to dispel the suspicion that the police activities could still suffer "guidelines." The spontaneous effiorescenza abundance of problems, also joined the controversial use of police from the government Badoglio, who made use geared towards a concept quite briskly on how to counter the movements of the square and the brawls: animosities were sedated with frequent use of weapons, causing dozens of deaths, despite the time was already plenty of conflict on their behalf, aroused wide condemnation in civil society.

Despite the gravity of the situation generally, in 1945 it gave birth to the specialty of the Railway Police and Traffic Police, the first compartment was installed at the police headquarters in Milan.

==Post World War Two: Towards the new police==
The Ministry of the Interior, after the liberation, was [[Giuseppe Romita]], who also made use of the police later considered questionable by many parties. Romita was to establish the "[[Celere]]" [6], mandated to help in public security in the post-Liberation era. The Celere was fitted with wooden truncheons at first [7] and some jeeps were provided by the United States Armed Forces.
[[File:Polizia di stato giulietta.JPG|thumb|In the seventies, under minister Cossiga, the cars were repainted in the new white and blue livery. The newly designed [[Alfa Romeo Giulietta (750/101)|Alfa Romeo Giulietta]] came directly supplied with the new colors.]]

Romita, proud of his creation, he turned his attention to the large Celere, who took so once brisk and sometimes nonchalant: during the referendum of 1946 for the option between monarchy and republic, the new Celere raised serious allegations against the royal police who would, they argued, hampered its actions.

The appointment as Minister of Interior [[Mario Scelba]], in 1947, had a large effect in the rapid reorganization of the police. Elements introduced at the end of the war were disbanded, the so-called [[auxiliary police]], and taken care of loyalty to the state and democracy.

The Celere, however, still grew by perfecting the equipment (it was equipped with heavy machine guns and even mortars) as a full-time paramilitary national police force capable of situations that the onset of war the cold war made it not unlikely. At the same time, the organization of being revised and certain specialties were divided into separate departments directly dependent on the general direction. These were among the [[postal police]], the traffic police, the railway police and border police.

In December 1959 the Women's Police Corps was created, evidently composed of female staff and dedicated to sensitive issues of great moral importance, such as the protection of women and the protection of minors, the body, parallel to the police "traditional", had also practical purpose of supporting this for some tasks that could not be entrusted to men, such as searching corporal women. The almost simultaneous introduction of the discussed [[Merlin Law]], which came into force on 1 September 1959 and the regulations on prostitution, contributing to increase the skills and staffing needs, making the female corps of even more immediate utility.

===Angelo Vicari and the new Police===
The sixties, the story dominated by youth movements and changes of society, which linked the review to revitalizing the economy of social relations, were led by the figure of the police prefect [[Angelo Vicari]], who left a trail of critical importance.

Vicari created the criminal police (Criminalpol), initially as a division for Coordination (concept once again borrowed from other foreign corps) 's Interpol with some internal investigative services. He also had a review of the organization of schools of education, constituted an autonomous division, and the transformation of the Higher School of Police in the Academy of Police. His era was marked by an increased difference and distinguishment between the military and civil police officers within the police services of the republic.

[[File:2june2006 310.jpg|thumb|left|With the reform of 1981, women have had access to all roles and departments of the State Police, including the departments of Traffic Police has always been considered especially selective and renowned for training and performances, such as on parade.]]

In any event, the 'military' officers were trained and managed in a manner akin to the officers of the Carabinieri and, as such potential field grade officers were to study in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Scuola di guerra dell'esercito|it}} before posting to more higher commands of the police.

In this particular situation the police had come to interpret "Italian" with the strict provisions of the "diktat", the peace treaty which imposed a severe limitation on the number of soldiers that Italy could recruit: with the militarization Police Commissioner, who had not been considered by the Treaty, the police could act as soldiers, "added 'cunningly evading the terms of the yield and making the country the troops believed that Rome needed. In addition, the costs for maintaining organ so large is justified both by the availability of police force capable of guaranteeing a certain robustness to the system, both on a sort of solidarity (with the recruitment of unemployed) that was even easier for certain forms of political clientelism (and therefore indirectly support of consensus).

The police were not only a collection center for day laborers that the crisis of agriculture pushed towards the 'emigration and forced new buildings, badly paid and less gratifying: on the one hand, this seemed to be on the other grew technically and soon gained among the population, although it had almost absolute confidence in the Carabinieri, a new reputation as a rewarding effect. Historian physiological antagonism with the weapon was done in terms of technological competition, and was the golden age, for some almost mythological transformation of the police in a body of sophisticated efficiency. Many specialties were created, while the police stations specializing special teams dedicated to certain types of employment: aviation, homicide investigation and mobile patrol units.

Accomplice a taste of journalism, who poured in newspapers the echoes of literary noir fashion, great emphasis was given to the police every day inspired the fantasies of ordinary people. From the pages of news, which made it exciting too bogged sheets increasingly politicized, it evoked the names of policemen who were making daily actions worthy of cinema (and then the new medium of television) and popular amongst all should probably remember the name of [[Marshal Armando Spatafora]], called "Armandino", the only licensed guide service of the Ferrari (250 GTE), black, supplied with the [[Flying Squad]] in Rome. His actions, which gave rise to a surreal urban legends like the famous chase down the steps of Trinita dei Monti, were a spectacular side of the police, which still constitutes a charm sui generis.

Spatafora also modernized the patrol units within the civil police. The first radio station was established at police headquarters in Milan, where he installed a gigantic apparatus "Westinghouse 21" American-made, the original brand ( "W") was made in the code radio as "Double Sail" and "Double Vela 21 "thus became the code name of the plant, while cars derive their names in radio code on the brand of equipment on board," Iris ". he plant was actually a trading desk which began to flow all the information necessary for prompt intervention in the urban areas of expertise, and soon would become the terminal of the single emergency, the 113.

The financial administration of the Treasurer, who was struggling to cope with new demands that the daily reality, the election promises and agreements with other police forces and Interpol imposed could not keep up. The "modern" pistol Beretta Model "51", as the name indicates it was some time available, was slow to replace the old "34" (and its updated version, the "35") and if you could, there were sometimes problems with the cartridges in the innovative arms "9 mm Parabellum. Worse were rifles, obsolete [[Beretta MAB]], which magazines were often empty and the function of which was often only that of visual deterrence, being completely harmless to the lack of bullets.

The evolution of technology was also followed closely by crime, which began to organize themselves and that soon the police would have undermined the control of some parts of the territory. The old "bad" is urbanized and became a sort of underground network that was left over to everyday life, which emerged to perform robberies, murders and extortion, and then immediately submerge into the new in the anonymity of metropolitan cities. The police, for obvious reasons select "good people", was struggling to find points of contact useful for the prevention and repression, losing ground in favor of offenders despite many efforts.

===The Challenging Years===
[[File:Polizia di Stato.jpg|thumb|PS655 police boat in the channels of Venice. The State Police also has a maritime service, which carries out surveillance and rescuing the dependencies of the relevant police station. A new divers service joins the Operations Department and is based in [[La Spezia]].]]

The seventies saw the police services beyond the homologous areas of the Carabinieri, under operating pressures of commitment and seriousness comparable to a state of siege.

In this decade there were indeed dramatic increase in crime which reached dangerous numbers tragic simultaneously in many "specialists", including (but not limited to) [[terrorism]], attempted [[coups]], [[banditry]] ([[kidnapping]]), [[smuggling]], trafficking in narcotics, [[robbery]], [[extortion]], [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] robberies, [[racketeering]] and of 'wear, as well as political effervescence that for many years resulted in daily armed clashes between young people from opposing factions and between them and the police. This last point was perhaps the main theme of the troubled decade and brought home by the echoes of the "French May" (1968), arrived in Italy with a lag. Spontaneous student movements, mostly grouped in one area, though of uncertain terms, left, took on the role of opposition to a system whose effective and substantive democracy was seriously challenged. The fresh knowledge that remained stuck in the first wave of change in direction purely capitalist and consumerist economic system, was turning in the direction of fighting the state which promoted this system through its institutions and its symbols, the most obvious of these - and perhaps the most immediately attacked - was just the police (this also means the weapon).

From the first riots in the Faculty of Architecture of Rome (Valle Giulia), ran a road of violence increasing frequency in all major Italian cities, they saw the police forced in practice to organize real actions against guerrillas, cooling, however, and not without advantage, tactics and strategies of the army of Imperial Rome (e.g. Testudo, training of soldiers who joined the shields to protect themselves from the launch of blunt objects). The study of tear gas shells was accelerated, a kind of grenades are capable of emitting just gas tear, and therefore the department of public police were never again bear the sunset "Musket 91", which was applied a small Tromboncino for such launches. They were quickly (and expensively) provided armored cars and vans (later called directly "armored"), are the budgetary funds for bullets and introduced the short machine gun [[Beretta M12]] [8], were reviewed in full service anti-sabotage and Stock, and profiling "policies" were strengthened, as had not happened even in the police mouthpieces. On the other hand, cases of violence and repression of movements by the police occurred that echoed in the years to follow.

Police uniforms were now unified while separate rank insignia remained (blue-gray jacket and blue pants or skirts were now worn by all ranks), all service vehicles (first gray for public police and green, indeed "bucks" for the rest) were all repainted with the innovative white and blue livery for all forces. Disappeared the differences between the uniforms of the officers and those of the staff of the roles below (although recently have been reintroduced small differences, for example for the alamari (frogmen)).

Occurred in the heart of the Left, among others, the dissenting voice of [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], who with raw honesty the cops knew, sometimes among enrolled in danger threshold of 'literacy, fault, and often unknowingly sent against demonstrators, the real concrete holders of that proletariat in whose name the guerrilla actions were thrown - it marked the poet - from young people "spoiled children", intent on fighting a public middle classes that provide them with the shield which went home privately.

Undoubtedly remain the full vividness of the political debate in many cases is still controversial, for reasons that were erect the flag: the death of [[Giuseppe Pinelli]], such as that of commissioner [[Luigi Calabresi]], already occurred at the time to foresee that the relationship between a part of citizens and institutions would be seriously flawed.

But the events were able to overcome the weather and the terror took hold, from right and left, with massacres, bombings, murders and other crimes (including robbery for self-financing), giving the title of the disastrous decade "years of lead. In these, the police suffered a terrible toll of human lives, regaining the solidarity with the blood of the population.

The emergency was met by the governments in office with some legislative maneuvering it, providing more flexible powers to staff (for example on police custody [9]), stoke controversy over the King's laws and the alleged "authoritarian," while managers were refurbished branches dedicated to the fight against terrorism. Born 's [[UCIGOS]] [[special branch]] officers, operating on the territory through the DIGOS of each police station and through the [[NOCS]], elite corps for special operations.

In 1977 the law of reorganization of the intelligence services, which on one hand he centralized the government the direct political control with the submission to [[CESIS]] other, it opened to facilitate operational coordination of services and the police, opened the operators hope the prospect of a reform of the police. Officials and the state demanded, his voice even more pressing, a review of working conditions, supervision of career, streamlining and facilitation of tasks, as well as better compliance with the task of sacrifice in which they found, however unseemly for salaries for reasons of occupation.

===The Reforms of 1981===

Law No. 121 of 1 April 1981 was created to answer some of those instances and problems facing the police. Until the eighties, under the heading Police were grouped subjects belonging to three separate organizations:

* State Police officials, civil servants who had the responsibility of managing the offices of the Department of Public Order and in police stations and Commissariats which were responsible for conducting the business and services of the Judicial Police and Public Order;
* Officers, noncommissioned officers and enlisted men of the Public Security Corps, which operates, to the respective levels of responsibility, the services of the Judicial Police and Police, as well as personnel from the Traffic Police, Railway Police, Border Police and Postal Police;
* and the inspectors, commissioners, assistants and constables of the women's police force who are involved in preventing and combating crime of morality, women and children.

[[File:2june 2007 495.jpg|thumb|With the reform of 1981, the State Police was no longer a military corps, but it preserves its past military traditions. Women officer cadets in the Republic Day 2007.]]

With the reform imposed by the Law 121, the new State Police, a " corpo civile militarmente organizzato " (civic body militarily organization) to protect the State and citizens from crime and disturbance of public order, integrated personnel from the Public Security Corps and the Women's Police Corps into one, joining the civil officials and commissariats under the old police. The new Police became a civil police organization in all respects (new recruits and all agents no longer wore the star, the symbol of the armed forces, and was replaced by the monogram "RI" [10]), open to men and women. With the end of the militarized police systems the new PdS ended the long-standing ban for the creation of labour unions, [11] thus police trade unions began to be formed, the largest of them later became the SIULP (Sindacato Italiano Unitario Lavoratori Polizia - Union of Italian Workers Unitary Police) and enactment of major trade union confederations, and SAP (Sindacato Autonomo di Polizia - Union of Autonomous Police), placed on a position of equidistance from the political and social forces. [12].

Police ranks were finally unified into a common system of police officials, non-commissioned personnel and agents, while separate systems for the medical and technical service personnel were issued. Today the PdS also sports the dark blue uniforms which were adopted in the early 1980s.

'''Howden v Ministry of Transport''' CA195/87 [1987] NZCA 113; [1987] 2 NZLR 747; (1987) 2 CRNZ 417  is a cited case in New Zealand regarding trespass and the defence of implied licence to enter a property &lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Howden, one early Sunday morning, was driving home to his parents house in [[Mosgiel]]. Unbeknown to him, a MOT traffic officer was following him with the intent to do a random stop on him.

However, before the traffic officer could pull him over, he had reached his destination, and had pulled up his parents driveway and entered the house. The traffic officer then parked his car up the driveway and proceeded to talk to Howden.

Howden was then asked to sit in the patrol car whilst his driving licence details were checked. The officer then parked his car on the Road (a public place), where Howden admitted he had consumed alcohol.

As a result of this statement, he was ordered to perform a breath test, which he failed.

He was charged and later convicted of the offence of driving under the influence of alcohol, being fined $250 and disqualified from driving for 6 months.

Howden subsequently appealed the conviction unsuccessfully to the District Court, on the basis that the breath test was illegally obtained as a result of the traffic officer trespassing, and appealed this time to the High Court.

==Held==
The court held that although a person has an implied licence to enter a property, this licence can only be actioned in a reasonable manner. Entering a property at 1.30am in the morning, most people would find an unreasonable hour. That meant that the Traffic officer was trespassing at the time, making the breath test illegal, resulting in the court overturning the [[conviction]].

Footnote: As a result of this court case, the government soon changed the law to make such situations legal.

{{coord|49|27.2603|N|11|02.9103|E|region:DE_type:event|display=title}}

The '''Judges' Trial''' ({{Lang-de|Juristenprozess}}; or, the '''Justice Trial''', or, officially, '''''The United States of America vs. Josef Altstötter, et al.''''') was the third of the 12 trials for [[war crime]]s the [[United States|U.S.]] authorities held in their occupation zone in [[Germany]] in [[Nuremberg]] after the end of [[World War II]]. These twelve trials were all held before U.S. military courts, not before the [[International Military Tribunal]], but took place in the same rooms at the [[Palace of Justice (Nuremberg)|Palace of Justice]]. The twelve U.S. trials are collectively known as the "[[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials]]" or, more formally, as the "Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals" (NMT).

The defendants in this case were 16 German jurists and lawyers. Nine had been officials of the [[Reich Ministry of Justice]], the others were prosecutors and judges of the [[Sondergerichte|Special Courts]] and [[People's Court (German)|People's Courts]] of [[Nazi Germany]]. They were—amongst other charges—held responsible for implementing and furthering the Nazi "racial purity" program through the eugenic and racial laws.

The judges in this case, held in Military Tribunal III, were [[Carrington T. Marshall]] (presiding judge), former Chief Justice of the [[Supreme Court of Ohio]]; [[James T. Brand]], Associate Justice of the [[Supreme Court of Oregon]]; Mallory B. Blair, formerly judge of the [[Texas Courts of Appeals|Third Court of Appeals of Texas]]; and [[Justin Woodward Harding]] of the Bar of the State of Ohio as an alternate judge. Marshall had to retire due to illness on June 19, 1947, at which point Brand became president and Harding a full member of the tribunal. The Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution was [[Telford Taylor]]; his deputy was [[Charles M. LaFollette]]. The [[indictment]] was presented on January 4, 1947; the trial lasted from March 5 to December 4, 1947. Ten of the defendants were found guilty; four received sentences for lifetime imprisonment, and six received prison sentences of varying lengths. Four persons were acquitted of all charges.

==Indictment==
# Participating in a common plan or conspiracy to commit [[war crime]]s and [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]];
# War crimes through the abuse of the judicial and penal process, resulting in [[mass murder]], [[torture]], [[plunder]] of [[private property]].
# Crimes against humanity on the same grounds, including [[slave labor]] charges.
# Membership in a criminal organization, the [[NSDAP]] or [[SS]] leadership corps.

Count 4 applied only to Altstötter, Cuhorst, Engert, Joel (with respect to the SS) and to Cuhorst, Oeschy, Nebelung, and Rothaug concerning the NSDAP leadership. Both organizations had been found criminal previously by the [[Nuremberg Trials|IMT]].

Count 1 was dropped: the court declared the charge to be outside its jurisdiction. Judge Blair filed a dissenting opinion that stated that the court should have made a statement that the Military Tribunals of the NMT in fact ''did'' have jurisdiction over charges of "conspiracy to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity".

All defendants pleaded "not guilty".

The highest-ranking officials of the Nazi judicial system could not be tried: [[Franz Gürtner]], Minister of Justice died in 1941; [[Otto Georg Thierack]], Minister of Justice since 1942, had committed suicide in 1946, and [[Roland Freisler]], the President of the [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]] since 1942, was killed in a 1945 [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raid on Berlin]]; [[Günther Vollmer]], the [[Gauführer]] of Nazi Jurists had been killed in 1945. One who was alive but not tried was [[Hans Globke]] (died 1973).

All convicts were found guilty on all charges brought before them, except Rothaug, who was found guilty only on count 3 of the indictment, while he was found not guilty on counts 2 and 4. However, the court commented in its judgment that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"By his manner and methods he made his court an instrumentality of terror and won the fear and hatred of the population. From the evidence of his closest associates as well as his victims, we find that Oswald Rothaug represented in Germany the personification of the secret Nazi intrigue and cruelty. He was and is a sadistic and evil man. Under any civilized judicial system he could have been impeached and removed from office or convicted of malfeasance in office on account of the scheming malevolence with which he administered injustice."''&lt;ref name="Mazal"&gt;[http://www.mazal.org/archive/nmt/03/NMT03-T1156.htm Mazal].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The public considered the sentences generally too low. Most of the convicts were released already in the early 1950s; some (Lautz, Rothenberger, Schlegelberger) even received retirement pensions in [[West Germany]]. The guide to German law entitled ''Das Recht der Gegenwart'' is still being published under the name Franz Schlegelberger ({{ISBN|3-8006-2260-2}}).

The Judges' Trial was the inspiration for the 1961 movie ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'', starring [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Richard Widmark]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Maximilian Schell]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Montgomery Clift]], [[Werner Klemperer]] and [[William Shatner]].

[[Image:RudolfvonIhering2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Rudolf von Ihering, one of the juris philosophers of the jurisprudence of concepts]]
The '''jurisprudence of concepts''' was the first ''sub-school'' of [[legal positivism]],&lt;ref name="ARCOS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcos.org.br/livros/hermeneutica-juridica/capitulo-iii-o-positivismo-normativista/3-a-jurisprudencia-dos-conceitos/|title=A Jurisprudência dos Conceitos|author=Costa, Alexandre Araújo|publisher=Arcos|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdv.br/publicacoes/periodicos/revistadepoimentos/n7/6.pdf|title=A importância da Jurisprudência dos Conceitos para a Metodologia Jurídica|author=Pepino, Elsa Maria Lopes Ferreira; Graviorno, Gracimeri, Vieira Soeiro de Castro; Filgueira, Sofia Varejão|publisher=Revista Depoimentos, da Faculdade de Direito de Vitória|accessdate=17 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119225127/http://www.fdv.br/publicacoes/periodicos/revistadepoimentos/n7/6.pdf|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to which, the written [[law]] must reflect [[concept]]s, when [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpreted]].&lt;ref&gt;that means that the interpretation of the words stated in the law must be guided by the scientific concepts that these words represent.&lt;/ref&gt; Its main representatives were [[Rudolf von Ihering|Ihering]], [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Savigny]] and [[Georg Friedrich Puchta|Puchta]].

This school was, thus, the preceding trigger of the idea that law comes from a dogmatic source, imposition from man over man and not a ''natural'' consequence of other sciences or of metaphysical faith.

Among the main characters of the ''jurisprudence of concepts'' are:
* formalism, search of rights in written law
* systemisation
* search for justifying specific norm with basis from more generic ones.&lt;ref name="RSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seer.ucp.br/seer/index.php/LexHumana/article/download/5/4|title=Evolução Histórica da Teoria Hermenêutica - do Formalismo do Século XVIII ao Pós-Positivismo|author=Rocha, Sérgio André|year=2009|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, according to this school, law should have prevailing sources based upon the legislative process, although needing to be proven by more inclusive ideas of a social sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18008">The '''language of adoption''' is changing and evolving, and since the 1970s has been a controversial issue tied closely to [[adoption]] reform efforts. The controversy arises over the use of terms which, while designed to be more appealing or less offensive to some persons affected by adoption, may simultaneously cause offense or insult to others. This controversy illustrates the problems in adoption, as well as the fact that coining new words and phrases to describe ancient social practices will not necessarily alter the feelings and experiences of those affected by them. Two of the contrasting sets of terms are commonly referred to as '''positive adoption language''' (PAL) (sometimes referred to ''respectful adoption language (RAL)''), and '''honest adoption language''' (HAL).

==Positive adoption language==
In the 1970s, as adoption search and support organizations developed, there were challenges to the language in common use at the time. The term "natural mother" had been in common use previously.  The term "birth mother" was first used in 1956 by Nobel Prize winning author and adoptive mother Pearl S. Buck. As books like ''Adoption Triangle'' by Sorosky, Pannor and Baran were published, and support groups formed like CUB ([[Concerned United Birthparents]]), a major shift from natural parent to birthparent &lt;ref name=Birthparent&gt;[http://www.sacredhealing.com/triadoption/Misc./Origin%20of%20the%20Term%20Birthparent.pdf Birthparent Legacy Term] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219211754/http://sacredhealing.com/triadoption/Misc./Origin%20of%20the%20Term%20Birthparent.pdf |date=2010-12-19 }} TRIADOPTION® Archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~adoption/topics/birthparents.htm Birth Parents] The Adoption History Project&lt;/ref&gt; occurred. Along with the change in times and social attitudes came additional examination of the language used in adoption.

Social workers and other professionals in the field of adoption began changing terms of use to reflect what was being  expressed by the parties involved. In 1979, Marietta Spencer wrote "The Terminology of Adoption" for the [[Child Welfare League of America]] (CWLA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~adoption/archive/CwlaAT.htm Adoption Terminology] Child Welfare League of American 1980s&lt;/ref&gt; which was the basis for her later work "Constructive Adoption Terminology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.adoption.com/articles/a-few-words-on-words-in-adoption.html Adoption Language] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426035439/http://library.adoption.com/articles/a-few-words-on-words-in-adoption.html |date=2011-04-26 }} by Brenda Romanchik&lt;/ref&gt; This influenced Pat Johnston's "positive adoption language" (PAL) and "respectful adoption language" (RAL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perspectivespress.com/pjpal.html Speaking Positively: Using Respectful Adoption Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624013827/http://www.perspectivespress.com/pjpal.html |date=2008-06-24 }}, by Patricia Irwin Johnston&lt;/ref&gt; The terms contained in "positive adoption language" include the terms "birth mother" (to replace the terms "natural mother" and "real mother"), "placing" (to replace the term "surrender").

Language, at its best, honors the self-referencing choices of the persons involved, utilizes inclusive terms and phrases,  and is sensitive to the feelings of the primary parties. Language evolves with social attitudes and experiences. The example below is one of the earliest and it should be noted that these lists, too, have evolved and changed some over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adoptivefamilies.com/pdf/PositiveLanguage.pdf PAL 1992] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112220547/http://www.adoptivefamilies.com/pdf/PositiveLanguage.pdf |date=2011-01-12 }} OURS 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holtinternational.org/adoption/language.shtml Holt 1997] Holt International 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

''The reasons for its use'': Some terms like birth parents, birth mother, birth father were chosen by those working in adoption reform as terms to replace 'natural' and it took nearly a decade before agencies, social workers, courts and laws embraced the change in self-referencing. Some adoptive parents supported this change as they felt using "natural" indicated they were "unnatural". In some cultures, adoptive families face an anti-adoption bias. This can be evident in English-speaking cultures when there is prominent use of negative or inaccurate language describing adoption. So, to combat it, many adoptive families choose the use of positive adoption language.

''The reasons against its use'': Some adoptees believe "positive adoption language" creates cognitive dissonance, denies certain realities for the adoptee, &amp; treats the status of being an adopted person as if it is something to be ashamed of by insisting adoption should not be part of their identity.  Some birth parents see "positive adoption language" as terminology which glosses over painful facts they face as they go into the indefinite post-adoption period of their lives. They feel PAL has become a way to present adoption in the friendliest light possible, in order to obtain even more infants for adoption; i.e., a sales and marketing tool. Some feel the social work system has negatively compromised the intention of the birth family references and other terms, so that either the initial intent needs to be honored, or the terminology must again change.

=== Example of terms used in positive adoption language ===

| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |

| valign="top" align="left" width="50%" |
Some adoptees believe that their adoption is not their identity, but is an event that happened to them. ("Adopted" becomes a [[participle]] rather than an [[adjective]].) Others contend that "is adopted" makes adoption sound like an ongoing disability, rather than a past event.

give up for adoption
| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |

| valign="top" align="left" width="50%" |
"Give up" implies a lack of value. The preferred terms are more emotionally neutral.   
|-----
| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |
real mother/father/parent
| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |
birth, biological or genetic&lt;br&gt;

The use of the term "real" implies that the adoptive family is artificial, and is not as descriptive.

| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |
natural parent
| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |
birth parent or first parent
| valign="top" align="left" width="50%" |
The use of the term "natural" implies that the adoptive family is unnatural, and so is not a descriptive or accurate term. Although it can be seen as unnatural to conceive and relinquish children, the purpose is to present the adoption of those children in need as natural. The term "natural" in its origin means a family by the natural means of conception and birth and its primal bond which exists by itself since the beginning unless it's severed.

The use of the adjective "adopted" signals that the relationship is qualitatively different from that of parents to birth children.

| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |
surrender for adoption
| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |
placed or placed for adoption
| valign="top" align="left" width="50%" |
The use of the adjective "surrendered" implies "giving up."  For many parents placing a child for adoption is an informed completely voluntary choice. For others, there is no choice as the parent's rights were terminated because the parent was deemed to be unfit. 
|}

==Honest adoption language==
"Honest adoption language" refers to a set of terms that reflect the point of view that: (1) family relationships (social, emotional, psychological or physical) that existed prior to the legal adoption continue, and that (2) mothers who have "voluntarily surrendered" children to adoption (as opposed to involuntary terminations through court-authorized child-welfare proceedings) seldom view it as a choice that was freely made, but instead describe scenarios of powerlessness, lack of resources, and overall lack of choice.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, J. (1996). "Birth Mothers and Their Mental Health:  Uncharted Territory", ''British Journal of Social Work'', 26, 609-625.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, S. (1993). "What do Birthmothers Want?", ''[[Adoption &amp; Fostering (journal)|Adoption and Fostering]]'', 17(4), 22-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also reflects the point of view that the term "birth mother" is derogatory in implying that the woman has ceased being a mother after the physical act of giving birth.  Proponents of HAL liken this to the mother being treated as a "breeder" or "incubator".&lt;ref&gt;[http://foundandlostsupport.com/birthmothermeansbreeder.html "Why Birthmother Means Breeder,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706174005/http://www.foundandlostsupport.com/birthmothermeansbreeder.html |date=2008-07-06 }} by Diane Turski&lt;/ref&gt;  Terms included in HAL include the original terms that were used before PAL, including "natural mother", "Mother" and "surrendered for adoption", "own child" rather than "birth child" etc.  The organization [[Origins Canada]] has been a pioneer in promoting honest adoption language &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.originscanada.org/adoption-practices/adoption-language/language-of-adoption.html]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The reasons for its use'':  In most cultures, the adoption of a child does not change the identities of its mother and father:  they continue to be referred to as such.  Those who adopted a child were thereafter termed its "guardians," "foster," or "adoptive" parents.  Some people choose to use "honest adoption language" (HAL) because it reflects the original terminology. Some of those directly affected by adoption separation believe these terms more accurately reflect important but hidden and/or ignored realities of adoption. They feel this language also reflects continuing connection and does not exclude further contact.

''The reasons against its use'': The term "honest" implies that all other language used in adoption is dishonest.  HAL does not honor the historical aspects of the early adoption reform movement who requested and worked years to have terminology changed from natural to birth. Some adoptive parents feel disrespected by language like 'natural parent' because it can indicate they are unnatural.

| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |

| valign="top" align="left" width="50%" |
HAL views term "birth mother" as being derogatory, limiting a woman's purpose in her child's life to the physical act of reproduction and thus implying that she is a "former mother" or "breeder."  HAL terms reflect the point of view that there is a continuing mother-child relationship and/or bond that endures despite separation&lt;br&gt;

| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |
birth child
| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |
natural child, child of one's own&lt;br /&gt;
| valign="top" align="left" width="50%" |
HAL views the term "birth child" as being derogatory, implying that the adoptee was a "birth product" produced for the adoption market, and having no relationship or connection with his or her natural mother past the event of having been born.  It also implies that the mother is a "birth mother" with no connection to her child or interest in her child past this point&lt;br&gt;
|-----
| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |

| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |
surrender for adoption&lt;br /&gt;(have) &lt;br /&gt;(are) separated by adoption,
| valign="top" align="left" width="50%" |
HAL acknowledges that past adoption practice facilitated the taking of children for adoption, often against their mother's expressed wishes.  Many women who have gone through the process and who are separated from their children by adoption believe that [[social work]] techniques used to prepare single mothers to sign Termination Of Parental Rights papers closely resembles a psychological war against natural motherhood; hence the term "surrender."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclectica.org/v6n1/buterbaugh.html Not By Choice], by Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh, ''Eclectica'', 6(1), Jul/Aug 2001
&lt;/ref&gt; "Surrender" is also the legal term for the mother's signing a Termination of Parental Rights. "Realistic Plan", "Make a plan" and "place for adoption" are viewed by HAL proponents as being dishonest terms which marginalize or deny the wrenching emotional effect of separation on the mother/child dyad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.att.net/~judy.kelly/thesis.htm "The Trauma of Relinquishment,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216004357/http://home.att.net/~judy.kelly/thesis.htm |date=2009-02-16 }}" by Judy Kelly (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and imply the mother has made a fully informed decision.

| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |

| valign="top" align="left" width="50%" |
Referring to the people who have adopted the child as the mother or father (singular), ignores the emotional and psychological (and often physical) presence of a second set of parents in the child's life.  In contrast to RAL, HAL reflects the opinion that there are two sets of parents in the adopted person's life:  adoptive parents and natural parents.
|-----
| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |
adopted child
| valign="top" align="left" width="25%" |

| valign="top" align="left" width="50%" |
The use of the adjective 'adopted' signals that the relationship is qualitatively different from that of parents to other children. The use of the word "child" is accurate up until the end of childhood. After that the continued use of "child" is infantilizing. 
|}

== Inclusive adoption language ==

There are supporters of various lists, developed over many decades, and there are persons who find them lacking, created to support an agenda, or furthering division. All terminology can be used to demean or diminish, uplift or embrace. In addressing the linguistic problem of naming, [[Edna Andrews]] says that using "inclusive" and "neutral" language is based upon the concept that "language represents thought, and may even control thought."&lt;ref name="cs"&gt;Cultural Sensitivity and Political Correctness: The Linguistic Problem of Naming, Edna Andrews, ''American Speech'', Vol. 71, No. 4 (Winter, 1996), pp.389-404.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of [[inclusive language]] defend it as inoffensive-language usage whose goal is multi-fold:

# The rights, opportunities, and freedoms of certain people are restricted because they are reduced to [[stereotype]]s.
# Stereotyping is mostly implicit, unconscious, and facilitated by the availability of pejorative labels and terms.
# Rendering the labels and terms socially unacceptable, people then must consciously think about ''how'' they describe someone unlike themselves.
# When labeling is a conscious activity, the described person's ''individual'' merits become apparent, rather than his or her stereotype.

A common problem is that terms chosen by an identity group, as acceptable descriptors of themselves, can be then used in negative ways by detractors. This compromises the integrity of the language and turns what was intended to be positive into negative or vice versa, thus often devaluing acceptability, meaning and use.

In this evolving debate about which terms are acceptable in any era, there can be disagreements within the group itself. To be inclusive requires that no group ascribes to others what they must call themselves. Words and phrases must reflect mutual respect and honor the individual choice.

Inclusive adoption language is far more than an aesthetic matter of identity imagery that one embraces or rejects; it can focus the fundamental issues and ideals of social justice.  Language that is truly inclusive affirms the humanity of all the people involved, and shows respect for difference.  Words have the power to communicate hospitality or hostility, to exploit and exclude, as well as affirm and liberate. Inclusive language honors that each individual has a right to determine for themselves what self-referencing term is comfortable and best reflects their personal identity.

'''''Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.''''', 550 U.S. 618 (2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.|550|618|2007}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[employment discrimination]] decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].  Employers cannot be sued under Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] over race or gender pay discrimination if the claims are based on decisions made by the employer 180 days ago or more. [[Samuel Alito|Justice Alito]] held for the five-justice majority that each paycheck received did not constitute a discrete discriminatory act, even if affected by a prior decision outside the time limit. Ledbetter's claim of the “paycheck accrual rule” was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook journal | first=Jeremy A. | last=Weinberg | title=Blameless Ignorance?

R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons|link=|volume=541|page=369|pin=|year=2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a case of statutory rather than constitutional interpretation, explaining the meaning of a law, not its constitutionality. The plaintiff in this case, [[Lilly Ledbetter]], characterized her situation as one where "disparate pay is received during the statutory limitations period, but is the result of intentionally discriminatory pay decisions that occurred outside the limitations period."  In rejecting Ledbetter's appeal, the Supreme Court said that "she could have, and should have, sued" when the pay decisions were made, instead of waiting beyond the 180-day statutory charging period.  The Court did leave open the possibility that a plaintiff could sue beyond the 180-day period if she did not, and could not, have discovered the discrimination earlier.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Ledbetter'', 550 U.S. at 642 n.10 (“we have previously declined to address whether Title VII suits are amenable to a discovery rule. . . .Because Ledbetter does not argue that such a rule would change the outcome in her case, we have no occasion to address this issue.”)&lt;/ref&gt;  The effect of the Court's holding was reversed by the passage of the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act]] in 2009.

==Background of the case==
In 1979 Lilly Ledbetter, the plaintiff, began work at the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] in its [[Gadsden, Alabama]] location, a union plant. She started with the same pay as male employees, but by retirement, she was earning $3,727 per month compared to 15 men who earned from $4,286 per month (lowest paid man) to $5,236 per month (highest paid man).&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website|first=Kristin D. |last=Sostowski |title=U.S. Supreme Court Rules in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. That Title VII Pay Discrimination Claims Must Be Filed Within EEOC Statute of Limitations |publisher=[[Gibbons P.C.]] |url=https://www.gibbonslaw.com/us-supreme-court-rules-in-ledbetter-v-goodyear-tire--rubber-co-that-title-vii-pay-discrimination-claims-must-be-filed-within-eeoc-statute-of-limitations-07-06-2007/ |date=July 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her years at the factory as a salaried worker, raises were given and denied based partly on evaluations and recommendations regarding worker performance. From 1979-1981 Ledbetter received a series of negative evaluations, which she later claimed were discriminatory. Although her subsequent evaluations were good, in part as a result of those early negative evaluations, her pay never reached the level of similar male employees. All merit increases had to be substantiated by a formal evaluation.  In March 1998, Ledbetter inquired into the possible sexual discrimination of the [[Goodyear Tire Company]].  In July she filed formal charges with the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]].  In November 1998, after early retirement, Ledbetter sued claiming pay discrimination under Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]]. The Supreme Court did not rule on whether this was discrimination, just the statute of limitations to sue.

===Statutory provisions at issue===

*"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer… --to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin...."&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|42|2000e-2|a|1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"A charge under this section shall be filed within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred."&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|42|2000e-5|e|1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different standards of compensation...provided that such differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|42|2000e-2|h}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower court proceedings===
The District Court found in favor of Goodyear on the Equal Pay Act claim, because that Act allows pay differences that are based on merit. The court allowed the Title VII and other claims to proceed to trial.  Ledbetter claimed that she had been evaluated unfairly because of her sex and therefore had been paid significantly less than her male colleagues.  Goodyear claimed that their evaluations were non-discriminatory and focused only on worker competence. The jury found for Ledbetter and awarded back pay and damages. Goodyear appealed, arguing that all claims to damages before September 26, 1997 were void due to the [[statute of limitations]] placed on discrimination claims.

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] reversed the lower court's decision stating that Ledbetter could sue only for allegations regarding pay decisions that occurred less than 180 days before her beginning the EEOC process in March 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. |vol=421 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1169 |pinpoint= |court=[[11th Cir.]] |date=2005 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/421/1169/609066/ |accessdate=2018-07-09 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ledbetter, as the court ruled, could not sue on decisions that merely affected pay in the 180 day period.  Furthermore, all decisions made concerning pay in the 180 day period could not be unequivocally linked to her gender.  Ledbetter sought a writ of [[certiorari]], but did not contest the sufficiency of the evidence concerning decisions in the 180 day period.  The Supreme Court granted the writ and heard the appeal.

===Supreme Court precedent===
In ''United Airlines v. Evans'', Justice Stevens wrote as follows for the Court: "A discriminatory act which is not made the basis for a timely charge...is merely an unfortunate event in history which has no present legal consequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United Airlines v. Evans|431|553|1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court in ''Ledbetter'' said that "it would be difficult to speak to the point more directly."

}}
Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the court.  The Court held that according to Title VII, discriminatory intent must occur during the 180-day charging period.  Ledbetter did not claim that Goodyear acted with discriminatory intent in the charging period by issuing the checks, nor by denying her a raise in 1998.  She argued that the discriminatory behavior occurred long before but still affected her during the 180-day charging period.  [[Stare decisis|Prior caselaw]], the Court held, established that the actual intentional discrimination must occur within the charging period.  The Court also stated that according to those prior cases, Ledbetter’s claim that each check is an act of discrimination is inconsistent with the statute, because there was no evidence of discriminatory intent in the issuing of the checks. Alito was joined in his opinion by Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.

Justice Ginsburg wrote the dissent and read it from the bench, a rare practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website|first=Linda |last=Greenhouse |title=Justices Limit Discrimination Suits Over Pay |publisher=[[New York Times]] |url=https://nyti.ms/2pY9iRA |pin= |date=May 29, 2007 |access-date=July 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website|first=Robert |last=Barnes |title=Over Ginsburg's Dissent, Court Limits Bias Suits |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/29/AR2007052900740.html |pin= |date=May 30, 2007 |access-date=July 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Breyer, she argued against applying the 180-day limit to pay discrimination, because discrimination often occurs in small increments over large periods of time.&lt;ref name=Ginsburg&gt;''Ledbetter'', 550 U.S. at 645 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the pay information of fellow workers is typically confidential and unavailable for comparison.  Ginsburg argued that pay discrimination is inherently different from adverse actions, such as termination.&lt;ref name=Ginsburg/&gt;  Adverse actions are obvious, but small pay discrepancy is often difficult to recognize until more than 180 days of the pay change.  Ginsburg argued that the broad remedial purpose of the statute was incompatible with the Court's "cramped" interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;''Ledbetter'', 550 U.S. at 661.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her dissent asserted that the employer had been, "Knowingly carrying past pay discrimination forward" during the 180-day charging period, and therefore could be held liable.&lt;ref&gt;''Ledbetter'', 550 U.S. at 660.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''legal humanists''' were a group of scholars of [[Roman law]], which arose in Italy during the Renaissance with the works of [[Lorenzo Valla]] and [[Andrea Alciato]] as a reaction against the [[Postglossator|Commentators]].  In the 16th century, the movement  reached [[France]] (Bourges, where Alciato taught), where it became very influential. They had a general disdain for the [[Middle Ages]] and felt nothing good could come from then. They also had a great love of antiquarianism and were greatly concerned with the authority and accuracy of the [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]]. Thus, they described the work of the glossators and commentators as a malignant cancer on the text. They particularly disliked the commentators because in their attempt to apply law in practice, they had moved further and further away from the texts.

==Overview==

This was the time of the [[Renaissance]] in Europe, where people sought a new birth of society. They believed this would come through a return to the eternal principles underlying classical society. The religious reformers sought a return to the pure Word. In law, the humanists were a parallel movement, seeking a return to classical [[Roman law]]. This involved purifying the texts. The humanists had great confidence in the mind and so originally this was done through a conjectural knowledge of antiquity. However, [[Jacques Cujas|Cujaccius]] recognized the importance of studying the best and most original text, and thus used the Florentine manuscript. This enabled a better study of the interpolations of the text. However, as more and more interpolations were revealed, the quasi-[[bible|Biblical]] status of the texts was undermined, which undermined the work of the humanists.

Since the humanists were primarily concerned with a return to classical society, they were not solely interested in the law, but instead in the historical context. Some humanists placed little emphasis on the law except in respect to what it revealed about the Roman society, for example, Alicus. Pure law was thus given a monumental status. However, this resulted in a move away from practical application of the text. It was recognized that Roman law was the product of Roman society. This undermined the humanist movement as at the same time as arguing that [[Roman law]] was perfect for today’s society, they revealed it was a product of Roman society. The logical conclusion of this was that French law should be a product of French society. The humanists, for example, [[Hugues Doneau|Donellus]], presumed that [[Roman law]] was rational and so tried to find an underlying rational structure. They distinguished sharply between questions of procedure (the means of obtaining an answer) and questions of substantive law (what is due).

==Impact==

The humanists had little impact on the immediate practice of law. Court advocates and notaries remained faithful to the commentaries because the work of the commentators had been better circulated. Since they already knew the works of the commentators, they had a vested interest in ensuring that they remained the basis of the court system. Consequently, there were fierce rebuttals, such as that of [[Scipione Gentili]]. Humanism was largely irrelevant since it was based around the discovery of pure Roman law, and pure Roman law was only appropriate for Roman society.

In the long term, however, humanism did significantly influence legal science. The principle of using the best available text was established and the quasi-biblical authority of the texts was undermined, resulting in the rise of legal science. The systematisation of the texts was both aided and encouraged, giving rise to the Pandectist school. The logical skills of the humanists in their search for interpolations meant that lawyers had skills that were useful for society as a whole. They were thus the natural mediator in Italy when there was no emperor (and they had Imperial authority), they created a comprehensive system of law. When in French the church and crown were opposed, the humanists were able to help the king gain control with their use of logic.

A disputed impact of the humanists was on the law of contract. The Gordley thesis does not consider their work at all, and opponents to this thesis have argued that they were crucial to the development of modern [[contract law]].  The humanists and commentators had reached the point where they acknowledged a large number of ways that agreement could be “clothed” in order to give rise to legal action, however, they still maintained that these were exceptions to the general rule that an agreement could not give rise to an action on its own. However, it was only a small step from this to the recognition that generally an agreement would give an action, but there were a few exceptions. That the transition was not made by the commentators is thought to be because of their adherence to the texts. This was undermined by the humanists. Thus, we might expect that the humanists would have brought the change that Gordley credits to the Spanish NeoScholastics. However, there is no evidence that this took place, perhaps because the humanists despised the work of the commentators to such an extent that they were unwilling to effectively build on the foundations laid down by the commentators in this area.

Most of the humanists were Protestants and so died or fled after the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of Protestants in 1573. However, the direct link that Donellus fled to [[Leiden]] (via [[Germany]]) and started the Dutch Elegant School, has been questioned by Osler, who points out that the French Humanist school continued after the massacre and that the Dutch Elegant School did not really take off until Noodt at the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Osler |first=Douglas J. |title=Legal Humanism |publisher= [[Max-Planck Institute]] |url=http://www.rg.mpg.de/research/legal-humanism/ |accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''letter of marque and reprisal''' ({{lang-fr|lettre de marque; lettre de course}}) was a government license in the [[Age of Sail]] that authorized a private person, known as a [[privateer]] or [[French corsairs|corsair]], to attack and capture vessels of a nation at war with the issuer. Once captured, the privateer could then bring the case of that prize before their own [[admiralty court]] for condemnation and transfer of ownership to the privateer. A letter of marque and reprisal would include permission to cross an international border to effect a reprisal (take some action against an attack or injury) and was authorized by an issuing jurisdiction to conduct reprisal operations outside its borders.

Popular among Europeans from the late [[Middle Ages]] up to the 19th century, cruising for enemy prizes with a letter of marque was considered an honorable calling that combined patriotism and profit. Such privateering contrasted with attacks and captures of random ships, which was unlicensed and known as [[piracy]]; piracy was almost universally reviled.&lt;ref&gt;Upton's ''Maritime Warfare and Prize'' pp 170–171; 176. Discusses the history of letters of marque and reprisal. Upton is considered the foremost 19th-century American scholar on prize law.{{According to whom|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the differences between privateers and pirates were often at best subtle, and at worst more a matter of interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitson, ''Skull and Satire'', p. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konstam, ''Pirates: Predators of the Seas'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the meaning of the license itself, the terms letter of marque and privateer were sometimes used to describe the vessels used to pursue and capture prizes. In this context, a letter of marque was a lumbering, [[square rig|square-rigged]] cargo carrier that might pick up a prize if the opportunity arose in its normal course of duties. In contrast, the term privateer generally referred to a fast and weatherly [[fore-and-aft rig]]ged vessel, heavily armed and heavily crewed, intended exclusively for fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Petrie, ''The Prize Game'' p. 4: Noting cumberous square-rigged cargo carriers that often secured letters of marque "just in case", {{nowrap|"[c]onfusingly,}} such vessels were themselves called 'letters of marque'." Geoffrey Footner, ''Tidewater Triumph'', pp ?: Discusses  the difference between letter of marque vessels and privateers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and history of nomenclature==
Marque derives from the Old English ''mearc'', which is from the Germanic *''mark-'', which means boundary, or boundary marker, which is derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*merǵ-'', meaning boundary, or border. The French ''marque'' is from the [[Provençal language]] ''marca'', which is from ''marcar'', also Provençal, meaning, seize as a pledge.

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the first recorded use of "letters of marque and reprisal" was in an English statute in 1354 during the reign of [[Edward III]]. The phrase referred to "a licen[c]e granted by a sovereign to a subject, authorizing him to make reprisals on the subjects of a hostile state for injuries alleged to have been done to him by the enemy's army."&lt;ref&gt;2nd ed. (Clarendon Press, 1989) ( def. 1 of "marque" &amp; def. 2a of "marque" defining "letter of marque").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
[[File:Drake-treasure.jpeg|thumb|left|Drake viewing treasure taken from a Spanish ship, print&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchdetail.cfm?trg=1&amp;strucID=714871&amp;imageID=831578&amp;word=drake%20treasure&amp;s=1&amp;notword=&amp;d=&amp;c=&amp;f=&amp;k=0&amp;lWord=&amp;lField=&amp;sScope=&amp;sLevel=&amp;sLabel=&amp;total=1&amp;num=0&amp;imgs=20&amp;pNum=&amp;pos=1 from the Digital Gallery], New York Public Library (Drake/treasure)&lt;/ref&gt; courtesy [[New York Public Library]]]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], armed private vessels enjoying their sovereign's tacit consent, if not always an explicit formal commission, regularly raided shipping of other nations, as in the case of [[Francis Drake]]'s attacks on Spanish shipping, of which [[Elizabeth I]] (despite protestations of innocence) took a share.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Russell, ''The French Corsairs'' p. 10 (discussing history of private plundering ventures).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grotius]]'s 1604 seminal work on international law, ''De Iure Praedae'' (''Of The Law of Prize and Booty''), was an advocate's brief defending Dutch raids on Spanish and Portuguese shipping.&lt;ref&gt;Grotius, ''De Iure Praedae Commentarius (Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty)''pp 216-182 (Carnegie endowment translation of Grotius's Commentaries; the 12th Chapter later became the basis of the noted ''Mare Liberum'' (Freedom of the Seas) principle).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[King Henry III of England]] first issued what later became known as privateering commissions in 1243.&lt;ref&gt;Francis R. Stark, "The Abolition of Privateering and the Declaration of Paris," in ''Studies in History, Economics and Public Law'' 221, 270–71 (Faculty of Political Sci. of Columbia Univ. eds., Columbia University, 1897).&lt;/ref&gt;  These early licences were granted to specific individuals to seize the king’s enemies at sea in return for splitting the proceeds between the privateers and [[The Crown]].

The letter of marque and reprisal first arose in 1295,&lt;ref&gt;Stark at 272&lt;/ref&gt; 50 years after wartime privateer licenses were first issued. According to Grotius, letters of marque and reprisal were akin to a "private war", a concept alien to modern sensibilities but related to an age when the ocean was lawless and all merchant vessels sailed armed for self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;Grotius, ''De Iure Praedae Commentarius (Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty),'' pp. 62 (stating "the power to wage war privately resides in the individual, and the power to wage war publicly resides in the state").&lt;/ref&gt; A reprisal involved seeking the sovereign's permission to exact private retribution against some foreign prince or subject.  The earliest instance of a licensed reprisal recorded in England was in the year 1295 under the reign of Edward I.&lt;ref&gt;Eastman, ''Famous Privateers of New England'' p. 1 (citing Edward I 1295 reprisal commission).&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of reprisal, and behind it that just war involved avenging a wrong, clung to the letter of marque until 1620 in England, in that to apply for one a shipowner had to submit to the Admiralty Court an estimate of actual losses.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Russell, ''The French Corsairs'' p. 12(discussing early practice in England).&lt;/ref&gt;

Licensing privateers during wartime became widespread in Europe by the 16th Century,&lt;ref&gt;Eastman, ''Famous Privateers of New England'' p. 1 (recounting early letters of marque issued in contest between Spain and her revolted Low Countries in 1569).&lt;/ref&gt; when most countries&lt;ref&gt;Lord Russell, ''The French Corsairs'' p. 11(discussing history of letters of marque: in France the first recorded use of letters of marque and reprisal was 1681).&lt;/ref&gt; began to enact laws regulating the granting of letters of marque and reprisal.&lt;ref&gt;Upton's ''Maritime Warfare and Prize'' p. 176 (discussing the history of letters of marque and reprisal).&lt;/ref&gt; Business could be very profitable; during the eight years of the [[American Revolutionary War]] ships from the tiny island of [[Guernsey]] carrying letter of marque captured French and American vessels to the value of £900,000 and continued to operate during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref name="RBduV"&gt;{{cite book |first=R.A. |last=Henry |title=The Reclamation of the Braye du Valle 1806-2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Of course, profitable cruises paid for unprofitable ones, including cruises in which the enemy captured the privateer before it had captured anything.)

Although privateering commissions and letters of marque were originally distinct legal concepts, such distinctions became purely technical by the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Starkey, British Privateering Enterprise in the Eighteenth Century 20, 81 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States Constitution, for instance, states that "The Congress shall have Power To ... grant Letters of marque and reprisal ...",&lt;ref&gt;[[Enumerated powers|"The Constitution of the United States", Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11.]]&lt;/ref&gt; without separately addressing privateer commissions.

During the [[American War of Independence]], [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the [[War of 1812]], it was common to distinguish verbally between privateers (also known as private ships of war) on the one hand, and armed merchantmen, which were referred to as "letters of marque", on the other, though both received the same commission. The [[Sir John Sherbrooke (Halifax)|''Sir John Sherbrooke'' (Halifax)]] was a privateer; the [[Sir John Sherbrooke (Saint John)|''Sir John Sherbrooke'' (Saint John)]] was an armed merchantman. The [[East India Company]] arranged for letters of marque for its [[East Indiaman|East Indiamen]] such as the [[Lord Nelson (East Indiaman)|''Lord Nelson'']], not so that they could carry cannons to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China—that they could do without permission—but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the [[Earl of Mornington (1799 ship)|''Earl of Mornington'']], an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, too carried a letter of marque.

In July 1793, the East Indiamen {{ship||Royal Charlotte|1789 EIC ship|2}}, ''Triton'', and [[HMS Calcutta (1795)|''Warley'']] participated in the capture of [[Puducherry|Pondichéry]] by maintaining a blockade of the port. Afterwards, as they were on their way to China, the same three East Indiamen participated in an action in the [[Straits of Malacca]]. They came upon a French [[Sailing frigate|frigate]], with some six or seven British{{clarify|What nation did these vessels belong to?  The term "retake" suggests they were British.|date=March 2018}} prizes, replenishing her water casks ashore. The three British vessels immediately gave chase. The frigate fled towards the [[Sunda Strait]]. The Indiamen were able to catch up with a number of the prizes, and, after a few cannon shots, were able to retake them. Had they not carried letters of marque, such behaviour might well have qualified as piracy. Similarly, on 10 November 1800 the East Indiaman [[Phoenix (1785)|''Phoenix'']] captured the French privateer ''General Malartic'',&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=1006|issue=15397|date=15 August 1801}}&lt;/ref&gt; under [[Jean-Marie Dutertre]], an action made legal by a letter of marque. Additionally, vessels with a letter of marque were exempt from having to sail in convoy, and nominally their crew members were exempt, during a voyage, from [[impressment]].&lt;ref&gt;"Answers" (1911) ''Mariner's Mirror'', Vol. 1, №9 (September), pp.255-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Napoleonic Wars there were also two cases ([[Dart (1806 ship)|''Dart'']] and [[Kitty (1810 ship)|''Kitty'']]), where British privateers spent some months off the coast of Sierra Leone hunting slave-trading vessels.

==Applying for, and legal effect of, letter of marque==
[[File:Hanging of William Kidd.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|right| The body of [[Captain William Kidd]] hanging in a [[Gibbeting|gibbet]] over the [[Thames]], the result of confusion over whether Captain Kidd took prizes legally under a letter of marque, or illegally as a pirate.]]
The procedure for issuing letters of marque and the issuing authority varied by time and circumstance. In colonial America, for instance, colonial governors issued them in the name of the king. During the American War of Independence, first the state legislatures, then both the states and the Continental Congress, then, after ratification of the [[Constitution]], Congress authorized and the President signed letters of marque. A shipowner would send in an application stating the name, description, tonnage, and force (armaments) of the vessel, the name and residence of the owner, and the intended number of crew, and tendered a bond promising strict observance of the country's laws and treaties and of international laws and customs. The commission was granted to the vessel, not to its captain, often for a limited time or specified area, and stated the enemy upon whom attacks were permitted. For instance, during the [[Second Barbary War]] President James Madison authorized the Salem, Mass., brig ''Grand Turk'' to cruise against  "Algerine vessels, public or private, goods and effects, of or belonging to the [[Dey of Algiers]]".&lt;ref&gt;Eastman, ''Some Famous Privateers'' p. 45 (reproducing a letter of marque granted in 1815 to the ''Grand Turk'').&lt;/ref&gt;  (This particular commission was never put to use, as it was issued the same day the treaty was signed ending the U.S. involvement in the war—July 3, 1815.)

In England in the 18th century, a Letter of Marque was issued by the High Court of Admiralty of England. It was normal for the proposed privateer to pay a deposit or bond, possibly £1,500 (current value £150,000) as surety for good behaviour. The details of the ship, including tonnage, crew and weapons were recorded. The ownership of these ships was often split into ⅛ shares. Prizes were assessed and valued with profits split in pre agreed proportions between the government, the owners and the captain and crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Girard |first=Peter |title=More of Peter Girard's Guernsey: A Second Miscellany of Guernsey's History and Its People |publisher=Guernsey Press |ISBN=978-0902550421 |date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75}}

A letter of marque and reprisal in effect converted a private merchant vessel into a naval auxiliary. A commissioned privateer enjoyed the protection and was subject to the obligations of the laws of war. If captured, the crew was entitled to honorable treatment as prisoners of war, while without the licence they were deemed mere pirates "at war with all the world," criminals who were properly hanged.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Petrie, ''The Prize Game'' pp. 3-6, 68, 145 (noting difference between privateering and piracy; some, like [[Captain William Kidd]], crossed back and forth over the line).&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, enterprising maritime raiders commonly took advantage of "[[flag of convenience]]" letters of marque, shopping for cooperative governments to license and legitimize their depredations. French/Irishman [[Captain Luke Ryan]] and his lieutenants in just over two years commanded six vessels under the flags of three different nations and on opposite sides in the same war.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''The Prize Game'' p. 68 (discussing Luke Ryan--in these two years they took 140 recorded prizes).&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise the notorious Lafitte brothers in New Orleans cruised under letters of marque secured by bribery from corrupt officials of tenuous Central American governments, to cloak plunder with a thin veil of legality.&lt;ref&gt;William Davis, ''The Pirates Laffite'' p. ?.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adjudicating captures, invalid letter of marque, or illegal cruelty==
The letter of marque by its terms required privateers to bring captured vessels and their cargoes before [[admiralty courts]] of their own or allied countries for condemnation. Applying the rules and customs of [[Prize (law)|prize law]], the courts decided whether the letter of marque was valid and current, and whether the captured vessel or its cargo in fact belonged to the enemy (not always easy, when flying false flags was common practice), and if so the prize and its cargo were "condemned", to be sold at auction with the proceeds divided among the privateer's owner and crew. A prize court's formal condemnation was required to transfer title; otherwise the vessel's previous owners might well reclaim her on her next voyage, and seek damages for the confiscated cargo.&lt;ref&gt;Upton, ''Maritime Warfare and Prize'' p. 188 (saying prize court condemnation essential to convey clear title).&lt;/ref&gt;

Often questions arose as to the legitimacy of the letter of marque in the case of divided sovereignty during civil wars. An English court, for instance, refused to recognize the letters of marque issued by rebellious Ireland under [[James II of England|James II]], and hanged eight privateer captains as pirates.  Seventy-nine years later during the [[American Civil War]], the Union charged officers and crew of the [[Confederate privateer]] ''Savannah'' with piracy, calling their letter of marque invalid since the Union refused to acknowledge the breakaway Confederacy as a sovereign nation.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''The Prize Game'' p. 81 (discussing English hangings after rejecting as illegitimate letters of marque issued by Irish under James II, and the Confederate case of the ''Savannah'').&lt;/ref&gt; The case resulted in a [[hung jury]], and after Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] threatened to retaliate by hanging one Union officer for each executed Confederate privateer, the Union relented and thereafter treated Confederate privateersmen honorably as prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bbprivateer.ca/?q=node/11|title=An Introduction to Privateering History {{!}} Shady Isle Pirate Society|website=bbprivateer.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, ''The Confederate Privateers'' pp 133-151(chapter recounting trial of crew of ''Savannah'' and Davis's response; noting the Earl of Derby in the House of Lords protested the Union's treating privateers as pirates).&lt;/ref&gt;

Privateers were also required by the terms of their letters of marque to obey the laws of war, honour treaty obligations (avoid attacking neutrals), and in particular to treat captives as courteously and kindly as they safely could.&lt;ref&gt;Eastman, Famous Privateers of New England p. 44-45 (recounting a custom of the War of 1812, that British captives would insert in New England newspapers "a card of thanks expressing their appreciation for kind treatment accorded them as prisoners."&lt;/ref&gt;  If they failed to live up to their obligations, the Admiralty courts could — and did — revoke the letter of marque, refuse to award prize money, forfeit bonds, or even award [[tort]] (personal injury) damages against the privateer's officers and crew.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, ''The Prize Game'' p. 158 (noting that in 1803 Lord Stowall fined the British captors of two vessels for keeping the captive Spanish crews in irons).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition of privateering==
{{expand section|background on when major European nations and the US (Asian, and
others) abolished privateering|date=March 2018}}
Nations often agreed by treaty to forgo privateering, as England and France repeatedly did starting with the diplomatic overtures of [[Edward III]] in 1324; privateering nonetheless recurred in every war between them for the next 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Russell, ''French Corsairs'' at 13-33 (discussing repeated diplomatic efforts to ban privateering between France and England).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Franklin]] had attempted to persuade the French to lead by example and stop issuing letters of marque to their corsairs, but the effort foundered when war loomed with Britain once again.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Russell, ''French Privateering'' p. 34-35(discussing Franklin's efforts to persuade the French Legislative Assembly to ban privateering).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French Convention]] did forbid the practice, but it was reinstated after the [[Thermidorian Reaction]], in August 1795; on 26 September 1797, the Ministry of the Navy was authorized to sell small ships to private parties for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Histoire des Marins français 1789-1815|first=Hubert|last=Granier|others=illustrations by Alain Coz|publisher=Marines éditions|year=1998|isbn=2-909675-41-6|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, after the Congress of Paris at the end of the [[Crimean War]], seven European nations signed the [[Paris Declaration of 1856]] renouncing privateering, and forty-five more eventually joined them, which in effect abolished privateering worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;

Petrie, ''The Prize Game'' p. 143 (discussing the end of privateering.)&lt;/ref&gt; The United States was not a signatory to that declaration. Despite the attempt to end privateering around the world, nations continued issuing letters of marque. In 1879 at the beginning of the [[War of the Pacific]], [[Bolivia]] issued letters of marque to any vessels willing to fight for them. At the time Bolivia was under threat from Chile's fleet but had no navy.

==20th century==
In December 1941 and the first months of 1942, Goodyear commercial [[L class blimp]] ''Resolute'' operating out of [[Moffett Federal Airfield#History|Moffett Field in Sunnyvale]], California, flew anti-submarine patrols. As the civilian crew was armed with a rifle, many{{who|date=March 2018}} thought this made the ship a privateer, and that she and sister commercial blimps were operated under letter of marque until the Navy took over operation.&lt;ref&gt;Shock, James R.; Smith, David R., ''The Goodyear Airships'', Bloomington IL, Airship International Press, 2002, p. 43, {{ISBN|0-9711637-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without congressional authorization, the Navy would not have been able to legally issue any letters of marque.

==21st-century American reconsideration of letters of marque==
[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article 1]] of the [[United States Constitution]] lists issuing letters of marque and reprisal in Section 8 as one of the [[enumerated powers]] of [[United States Congress|Congress]], alongside the power to tax and to declare War. However, since the American Civil War, the United States as a matter of policy has consistently followed the terms of the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law|1856 Paris Declaration]] forbidding the practice.  The United States has not legally commissioned any privateers since 1815, although the status of submarine-hunting Goodyear airships in the early days of [[World War II]] created significant confusion. Various accounts refer to airships ''Resolute'' and ''Volunteer'' as operating under a "privateer status", but Congress never authorized a commission, nor did the President sign one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1591039 Theodore Richard, Reconsidering the Letter of Marque: Utilizing Private Security Providers Against Piracy (April 1, 2010). Public Contract Law Journal, Vol. 39, No. 3, pp. 411-464 at 429 n.121, Spring 2010. Available at ssrn.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of marque and reprisal was raised before Congress after the [[September 11 attacks]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2001/tst091701.htm TST: Statement on the Congressional Authorization of the Use of Force] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930113538/http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2001/tst091701.htm |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and again on July 21, 2007, by Congressman [[Ron Paul]]. The attacks were defined as acts of "air piracy" and the ''Marque and Reprisal Act of 2001'' was introduced, which would have granted the president the authority to use letters of marque and reprisal against the specific terrorists, instead of warring against a foreign state. The terrorists were compared to pirates in that they are difficult to fight by traditional military means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press2001/pr101101.htm Paul offers President New Tool in the War on Terrorism] on the homepage of United States House of Representatives, accessed at April 29, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502184326/http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press2001/pr101101.htm |date=May 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 15, 2009, Paul also advocated the use of letters of marque to address the issue of [[Piracy in Somalia|Somali pirates]] operating in the Gulf of Aden.  However, the bills Paul introduced were not enacted into law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10623">Literal contracts (''contractus litteris'') formed part of the [[Roman law]] of [[contract]]s. Of uncertain origin, in terms of time and any historical development, they are often seen as subsidiary in the Roman law to other forms. They had developed by at the latest 100&amp;nbsp;BC, and continued into the late [[Roman Empire]].

The form itself was a written entry in some form of account book, which [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] describes as either replacing an existing obligation from another source, or transferring a debt from one person to another. At least the second form was unavailable to [[peregrinus (Roman)|peregrines]]. It seems to have been limited to certain sums which were unconditional and which had the consent of the debtor. Its later development was shaped by changes in the oral contract, the ''[[stipulatio]]''.

==Origin==
The origin of the literal contract in uncertain. It is only towards the end of the second century BC that the evidence is suitably lucid for its existence.&lt;ref name="watson18"/&gt; The ability to discern a distinction between financial accounts in general and a literal contract plagues early sources.&lt;ref name="watson19"/&gt; Many, for example, describe the recording of receipts rather than disbursements. [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], writing later, considers the disbursement the central element, and so this throws doubt on the efficacy of the earlier sources to establish the presence of a literal contract.&lt;ref name="watson1920"/&gt; Dragomir Stojčević notes the presence of the terms "af" and "abs" in the early texts of [[Velius Longus]], drawing on the later works of [[Cicero]] to demonstrate that they were only used in conjunction with literal accounts.&lt;ref name="watson20"/&gt; However, the distinction between general accounts and a literal contract cannot be shown to any certainty, and the texts are still concerned only with the recording of receipts.&lt;ref name="watson20"/&gt; Cicero's account of a knight called C. Canius, known to have been active in 115&amp;nbsp;BC, does at least provide significant (and accepted) evidence of them literal contract's existence at this time.&lt;ref name="watson20"/&gt;

[[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]] identifies the main areas of uncertainty, which, if showed one way or the other, would elucidate the dating problem.  Of Gaius' two forms, which was the original form would also give an indication of the historical development. If the ''a re in personam'' form came first, then it must surely have come after the creation of ''bonae fidei'' contract forms, since the transfer of a ''[[stipulatio]]'' of ''[[mutuum]]'' form into a literal contract would have otherwise given no real benefit. It might have done if the literal contract was used to consolidate several different debts between two parties, to simplify them into a single action, but none of the texts point to this: they refer to a singular preceding obligation.&lt;ref name="watson2122"/&gt; If the ''a personam in personam'' form came first, then the development could have come much earlier.&lt;ref name="watson22"/&gt; The consent of the debtor was probably required: this is stated as fact by some modern lawyers,&lt;ref name="buckland456"/&gt; although Watson points to the alternative explanation of Stojčević. Under the normal explanation, the tablets of [[Herculaneum]] show that something other than the written contract itself was required, necessarily debtor's consent.&lt;ref name="watson2223"/&gt; Exactly how the record shows the debtor's consent is uncertain, however.&lt;ref name="thomas267"/&gt;

==Form==
The details of literal contracts are taken from a brief account in Gaius' ''Institutes'', a considerably different account by [[Theophilus (jurist)|Theophilus]], brief references in other legal texts and mere allusions in texts by non-legal authors.&lt;ref name="buckland456"/&gt; How exactly an early literal contract differed from ''mutuum'' itself is not certain.&lt;ref name="watson24"/&gt; The literal contract was formal: any claim would be based on the written form and not any facts which had led to its creation.&lt;ref name="nicholas196"/&gt;

The literal contract was, according to Gaius, a ''nomina transcripta'', and capable of functioning in two ways. The first is ''a re in personam'' ("from thing to person"), and transformed a debt resulting from another contractual arrangement (sale, hire, for example). A fictitious loan would then be constructed from the creditor to the debtor, thereby charging the debtor with fulfilling that obligation whilst discharging the other. The alternative  was in transferring a debt from person to another: ''a personam in personam''. The debt would be entered under the name of the person to whom it was being transferred.&lt;ref name="buckland456"/&gt;  Gaius' account indicates that it was a previous obligation was required in the classical law, and Watson believes this can be conclusively shown for the last century of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]]. However, it is possible that that was not the case originally. Appert was argued that the literal contract was created as an enforcement method for [[consensual contract]]s, before they became actionable in their own right.&lt;ref name="watson20"/&gt;

It must always for a certain, set monetary sum.&lt;ref name="buckland457"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thomas267"/&gt; It is recording as having always to be unconditional, although Cicero appears to mention a conditional case. It is possible that the parties waited for the eventuality to occur before making a record of the literal contract at all.&lt;ref name="buckland456"/&gt;  As mentioned above, it seems that the debtor was required to consent. Whilst a debtor would be expected to make an entry in his own accounts, this does not seem to have affected the validity of the literal contract.&lt;ref name="buckland456457"/&gt; It was ''[[stricti iuris]]'', and enforceable under the ''actio certae pecuniae creditae''. The respondent could claim under the ''exceptio non numeratae pecuniae'' that the loan had never been made. However, this would normally be true, for the loan was normally a fictitious construct. Accordingly, the exception probably related to the non-existence of the prior agreement or debt.&lt;ref name="buckland457"/&gt;

The accepted approach in terms of physical form is an entry into the household's ''codex accepti and depensi'' &amp;ndash; which would have to be balanced with a second fictitious entry. In the case of the ''a rem'' form, it would be a receipt of the amount owed on the account of the previous transaction; ''a personam'', it would be an entry showing the receipt from the debtor from whom the debt was being transferred.&lt;ref name="buckland457"/&gt; If the literal contract was indeed limited to entries in ''tabulae'' ("account books"), then it must necessarily post-date their existence (and some measure of use), thus pointing to a later date than might be supposed if the literal contract extended to other forms of written words. The latter is favoured by Stojčević.&lt;ref name="watson21"/&gt;

The Sabinian school believed that neither form could be conducted by [[peregrinus (Roman)|peregrine]]s, the Sabinians that they could use the ''a re'' form, but not the ''a personam'' could.&lt;ref name="buckland456"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thomas268"/&gt; Before the classical age is unclear, as is the basis for making such a distinction. It is possible that like the ''[[spondeo]]'' form of verbal contract, it was derived mostly from tradition: that is considered entirely peculiar to Romans. This would suggest that it was much older. The alternative is that the completion of orderly account books were assumed to be restricted to Romans, and not something that a peregrine would or could do.&lt;ref name="watson24"/&gt;

==Later law==
The literal contract disappeared late into the classical age, sustained by its use in the banking trade.&lt;ref name="buckland457458"/&gt; In [[Justinian]]'s law, it had been replaced by the written form of the ''[[stipulatio]]'', and by a form of conclusive evidence for another sort of loan (''mutuum'' or ''commodatum'') where the holder lost his ''exceptio'' that the loan had not taken place after a period of time. Authors such as [[W. W. Buckland]] and [[Barry Nicholas]] believe Justinian's claim that this was a new form of literal contracts to be badly mistaken, the latter suggesting it was created mainly to bring the number of types up to four, the preferred number of divisions.&lt;ref name="buckland458"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nicholas197"/&gt; Accordingly, no mention is made in the Digest to the original form.&lt;ref name="thomas267"/&gt; Gaius refers to two types of document: the [[chirograph]], made by a debtor only, and a [[syngraph]] made by both parties. He identifies them with the peregrine's law only; after the extension of citizenship to the majority of the free peoples of the Empire by [[Caracalla]], they continued to be used, but only in an evidentiary role.&lt;ref name="buckland458"/&gt;

The '''Massachusetts Teachers' Oath''' was a [[loyalty oath]] required to teach in [[Massachusetts]] from 1935 to 1967.

==Passage==
In response to political radicalism during the [[Great Depression]], several states passed legislation that required public school teachers to submit signed oaths of loyalty to the state and/or federal [[Constitution]]s.  This movement, supported by the national American Legion and other organizations, gained strength in Massachusetts in 1934 and 1935.

In 1935, after stormy hearings before the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]]'s Joint Education Committee at which [[Harvard]] President [[James B. Conant]], historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison]], and the presidents of several colleges and universities spoke against the legislation, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-dominated House and Senate enacted teachers' oath legislation.  The oath bill was introduced by Democratic state Representative [[Thomas Dorgan]].  Dorgan became known as the "Father of the Teachers' Oath," and resisted all efforts at repeal, both in and out of office.

The Massachusetts legislation was unique in that it applied to private educational institutions as well as public.  It prompted the resignations of two [[Tufts University]] professors, [[Earle Winslow]] and [[Alfred C. Lane]] in December 1935.  Lane moved to Florida, but Winslow decided to run for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s nomination for the 9th [[Congressional District]] in 1936.  In the September primary, he came in 5th out of six candidates, earning only 1,452 votes out of 27,948 cast.  Thomas Dorgan lost in his bid for the nomination for  Suffolk County Court Clerk.  He secured a position with the state Department of Taxation, and in 1939 Democratic Mayor [[Maurice Tobin]] appointed him "legislative agent" for the [[City of Boston]].

==In force==
Harvard Geology Professor [[Kirtley Mather]] took a strong stand against the oath, but under pressure from President Conant he submitted a signed oath form in December 1935. The Quaker Harvard Professor  of Religion, [[Henry Cadbury]], rejected the teacher's oath in the 1930s, for reasons of conscience, telling the truth, and as a form of social activism. He turned down the Hollis Professorship in Divinity at Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalistfriends.org/UF035.html#Cadbury Universalist Friend: Fall/Winter 2000: Vol 35&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The controversy also cost the long-serving state Commissioner of Education [[Payson Smith]] his job.  Smith had spoken out against the legislation during the hearings, but nevertheless strictly enforced the law despite a compromise worked out with leading educators and the Attorney General, [[Paul Dever]].  Despite this, Democratic Governor [[James Michael Curley]] wanted Smith out.  Smith's term expired on December 1, 1935, and he continued to serve as Acting Commissioner while he awaited his fate.  The media and educational leaders pressured Curley to re-appoint Smith, so Curley met with the Democrats on the [[Governor's Council]] in closed session shortly before they were to vote on the issue.  When the Council met, Curley submitted Smith's name and it was promptly rejected.  Curley then nominated [[Adams, Massachusetts]] school superintendent [[James G. Reardon]], and the Council voted to approve him.  Reardon, a graduate of [[Boston College]], had spoken out in favor of the oath law.  

==Repeal==
In 1936, several well-respected educators, including Morison and Mather, joined together to form the [[Massachusetts Society for Freedom in Teaching]] (MSFT) to coordinate efforts to repeal the oath legislation.  This organization worked closely with educational leaders like Conant and President Daniel Marsh of [[Boston University]] to lobby for repeal.  As a result of the November elections, sixty representatives who supported the oath were not returned to the House, and oath opponents hoped that this change could lead to repeal.

The Republican House and Senate did pass repeal legislation in March 1937, but the vote in both chambers proved very close: 21&amp;ndash;19 in the Senate, and 120&amp;ndash;112 in the House.  Democratic Governor [[Charles Francis Hurley]] vetoed the legislation, claiming that it was an important part of the fight against radicals and [[Communists]].  Opponents of the oath in the House were unable to muster the two-thirds majority required to override Hurley's veto, which was sustained by a vote of 101&amp;ndash;100.

Although newly elected Republican Governor [[Leverett Saltonstall]] indicated that he would sign a repeal bill in early 1939, it failed to pass the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Shawn M. Lynch, "'In Defense of True Americanism': The Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and Radical Free Speech, 1915&amp;ndash;1945" (Ph.D. Dissertation, Boston College, December 2006), 103&amp;ndash;165.&lt;/ref&gt;

The teachers' oath legislation remained in force until invalidated by the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] in 1967 in its ruling on ''[[Pedlosky v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]''.  The [[Massachusetts General Court]] passed legislation to repeal all loyalty oaths in 1986, which was signed by Governor [[Michael Dukakis]].

The '''''Modern Law Review''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] on behalf of Modern Law Review Ltd. and which has traditionally maintained close academic ties with the Law Department of the [[London School of Economics]]. The ''Modern Law Review'' has been identified as the "pre-eminent United Kingdom law journal" in a ranking based on statistical data from the 2001 [[Research Assessment Exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell K, Goodacre A, Little G |title=Ranking of United Kingdom Law Journals: An Analysis of the Research Assessment Exercise 2001 Submissions and Results |journal=Journal of Law and Society |volume=33 |pages=335–63 |year=2006 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6478.2006.00362.x/abstract |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6478.2006.00362.x}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal is a general [[law review]] that publishes original articles relating to [[common law]] jurisdictions and the law of the [[European Union]]. In addition, the journal contains sections devoted to recent legislation and reports, to case analysis, to [[review article]]s, and to [[book review]]s.  The current [[editor-in-chief]] is Julia Black (London School of Economics). Previous editors included [[Robert Chorley, 1st Baron Chorley|Lord Chorley]], [[Lord Wedderburn of Charlton|Lord Wedderburn]], and [[Hugh Collins]].

The contents of the first 59 volumes (published between 1937 and 1996) are freely available online; more recent volumes are available on a subscription basis.

== Foundations ==
The Modern Law Review Ltd. is a [[Charitable organization|charity]] that was established in 1937 to promote the study of law and related fields. To this end, it publishes the law review and organises lectures and seminars and offers scholarships and awards.&lt;ref name="modernlawreview1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernlawreview.co.uk/scholarship.asp |title=The Chorley Lectures |publisher=Modern Law Review |date= |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the review provides the funding to host the annual Chorley Lecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernlawreview.co.uk/seminars.asp |title=Seminars |publisher=Modern Law Review |date= |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chorley Lecture ==
The annual Chorley Lectures started in 1972 and are named in honour of [[Robert Chorley, 1st Baron Chorley]], the founding editor of the ''Modern Law Review''. The lecture is usually delivered in early June at the London School of Economics and subsequently published as the lead article in the January issue of the following year's volume.&lt;ref name="modernlawreview1"/&gt;

== Wedderburn Prize ==
The annual Wedderburn Prize is awarded for "a contribution to that year's volume which in the opinion of the [[Editorial board|editorial committee]] is exemplary of the type of scholarship that ''The Modern Law Review'' aims to promote".&lt;ref name="modernlawreview2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modernlawreview.co.uk/about-wedderburn-prize/ |title=The Wedderburn Prize |publisher=Modern Law Review |date= |accessdate=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named in honour of [[Lord Wedderburn of Charlton]], who served as general editor of the review from 1971 to 1988. Preference is given to the work of authors who are at a relatively early stage of their careers.&lt;ref name="modernlawreview2"/&gt; Previous winners of the Wedderburn Prize include [[Kimberlee Weatherall]], [[David Kershaw]], and [[Nico Krisch]].&lt;ref name="modernlawreview2"/&gt;

Because of uneven modernization, Bloch argues, there remained in Germany, "this classical land of non-simultaneity",&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''Heritage'', p.106.&lt;/ref&gt; significant traces of pre-capitalist relations of production:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Not all people exist in the same Now. They do so only externally, by virtue of the fact that they may all be seen today. But that does not mean that they are living at the same time with others.

Rather, they carry earlier things with them, things which are intricately involved. One has one's times according to where one stands corporeally, above all in terms of classes. Times older than the present continue to effect older strata; here it is easy to return or dream one's way back to older times. [...] In general, different years resound in the one that has just been recorded and prevails. Moreover, they do not emerge in a hidden way as previously but rather, they contradict the Now in a very peculiar way, awry, from the rear. [...] Many earlier forces, from quite a different Below, are beginning to slip between. [...]

Over and above a great deal of false nonsynchronism [non-simultaneity] there is this one in particular: Nature, and more than that, the ghost of history comes very easily to the desperate peasant, to the bankrupt petty bourgeois; the depression which releases the ghost takes place in a country with a particularly large amount of pre-capitalist material. It is important to ask whether Germany is not more undeveloped, even more vulcanic than, for instance, France, in terms of its ''power''. Certainly it has not formed and evened out capitalist ''ratio'' nearly as synchronously.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, "Nonsynchronism", pp.22–30.&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The text signals that to some extent these ideas derive from [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy|Critique of Political Economy]]'', and in particular his notion of "the unequal rate of development",&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, "Nonsynchronism", p.29.&lt;/ref&gt; or "uneven development" (as it is more usually rendered in its [[Leon Trotsky|Trotskyist]] formulation). Marx had also used the term "simultaneity" (''Gleichzeitigkeit'') in his explanation of the concentration of production processes under the demands of commodity production in the first volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' ([[#In the work of Marx|see below]]). But Bloch's argument is also an attempt to counter simplistic interpretations of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] and Marxist [[teleology]], by introducing what he terms "the polyrhythm and the counterpoint of such dialectics",&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, "Nonsynchronism", p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; a "polyphonous", "multispatial" and "multitemporal" [[dialectics]],&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, "Nonsynchronism", pp.37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; not in order to deny the possibility of proletarian revolution, but in order to "gain ''additional revolutionary force'' from the ''incomplete'' wealth of the past":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The still subversive and utopian contents in the relations of people to people and nature, which are not past because they were never quite attained, can only be of use in this way. These contents are, as it were, the goldbearing gravel in the course of previous labor processes and their superstructures in the form of works. Polyphonous dialectics, as a dialectics of the "contradictions" which are more concentrated today than ever, has in any case enough questions and contents in capitalism that are not yet "superseded by the course of economic development".&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, "Nonsynchronism", p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This argument touches on the need to understand the spatial dynamics of capitalism that would be taken up in the 1960s and 1970s by Marxist urban philosopher [[Henri Lefebvre]], with his analysis of the dialectics of (urban) space, and his work on "[[rhythmanalysis]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== The simultaneity of the non-simultaneous ==
Although often attributed to "Nonsynchronism and the Obligation to its Dialectics", the phrase ''die Gleichzeitigkeit des Ungleichzeitigen'' ("the simultaneity of the non-simultaneous" or "the synchronism/synchronicity of the nonsynchronous") — i.e., a reversal of Pinder's "non-simultaneity of the simultaneous" — is not explicitly used in this work. Bloch elaborates instead the idea of synchronous and nonsynchronous ''contradictions'' with "the Now".&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, "Nonsynchronism", pp.31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; By "synchronous contradiction" he means those forces of contradiction (to capital) that capitalism itself generates, principally the contemporary industrialized proletariat (as analysed by Marx). "Nonsynchronous contradiction" refers to the [[atavism|atavistic]] survival of an "uncompleted ''past'' which has not yet been '[[Aufheben|sublated]]' by capitalism"&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, "Nonsynchronism", p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; as discussed above.

== In the work of Marx ==
{{Marxism}}
After the posthumous publication of Marx's ''[[Grundrisse]]'' in 1939, it became clear that a dialectic of simultaneity and non-simultaneity had been implicit in Marx's thinking on the spatiality and geography of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Harvey2001"&gt;{{cite book

|chapter=The Geography of Capitalist Accumulation: A Reconstruction of the Marxian Theory
|origyear=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (1867–94) had argued on the one hand that the money form had arisen in order to allow for non-simultaneous or delayed exchange of commodities (as opposed to face-to-face bartering), and on the other that "simultaneity" (''Gleichzeitigkeit'') was a requirement of (and a phenomenon produced by) the demands of commodity ''production'' (the capitalist has to be able to synchronize the disparate activities required to manufacture a product).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch14.htm | title = Economic Manuscripts: Capital Vol. I - Chapter Fourteen | accessdate = 19 May 2011 | last = Marx | first = Karl |authorlink=Karl Marx| year = 1867 | website = Das Kapital}}&lt;/ref&gt; The powerful spatio-temporal effects of the dual demands of exchange and commodity production were summarized in the ''Grundrisse'' with the concept of "the annihilation of space by time",&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Marx's concept, see Harvey, "The Geography of Capitalist Accumulation", pp.242–49.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. with the imposition of simultaneity or synchronicity over spatial separation and geographical diversity:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The more production comes to rest on exchange value, hence on exchange, the more important do the physical conditions of exchange — the means of communication and transport — become for the costs of circulation. Capital by its nature drives beyond every spatial barrier. Thus the creation of the physical conditions of exchange — of the means of communication and transport — the annihilation of space by time — becomes an extraordinary necessity for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch10.htm | title = Economic Manuscripts: Grundrisse: p 501 - p 550 | accessdate = 20 May 2011 | last = Marx | first = Karl |authorlink=Karl Marx| date = 1939 |origyear=1858 | website = Grundrisse: Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the same time, Marx showed himself to be acutely aware of the resistances to this overcoming of spatio-temporal barriers, and, more importantly, to the fact that capitalism ''itself generates its own resistances'', or contradictions, to the universalization of its [[mode of production]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But from the fact that capital posits every such limit as a barrier and hence gets ''ideally'' beyond it, it does not by any means follow that it has ''really'' overcome it, and, since every such barrier contradicts its character, its production moves in contradictions which are constantly overcome but just as constantly posited. Furthermore. The universality towards which it irresistibly strives encounters barriers in its own nature, which will, at a certain stage of its development, allow it to be recognized as being itself the greatest barrier to this tendency, and hence will drive towards its own suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch08.htm | title = Economic Manuscripts: Grundrisse: p 401 - p 450 | accessdate = 22 May 2011 | last = Marx | first = Karl |authorlink=Karl Marx| date = 1939 |origyear=1858 | website = Grundrisse: Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Due to the late publication of the ''Grundrisse'', Bloch would not have been acquainted with these precise words at the time of the writing of "Nonsynchronism", although the similarity of concepts relating to the way in which capitalism posits its own (simultaneous and non-simultaneous) contradictions to production ultimately derives from ''Das Kapital'' as discussed above.

As [[structural Marxism|structural Marxists]], Althusser and Balibar were concerned to understand how "the problems of [[wikt:diachronic|diachrony]]" in the transition from one mode of production to another could be related to the overall structure or "synchrony" of production.&lt;ref name="Balibar, p.307"&gt;Althusser and Balibar, ''Reading "Capital"'', p.307.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Reading Capital]]'' (1970), they argue, in similar vein to Bloch, that the succession of different modes of production as theorized by Marx is not a teleological process driven by "the forward march of the productive forces",&lt;ref name="Cutler1977"&gt;{{cite book

|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that instead periods of transition are marked by "the coexistence of several modes of production":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus it seems that the dislocation [''décalage''] between the connexions and instances in transition periods merely reflects the coexistence of two (or more) modes of production in a single 'simultaneity ', and the dominance of one of them over the other. This confirms the fact that the problems of diachrony, too, must be thought within the problematic of a theoretical 'synchrony': the problems of the transition and of the forms of the transition from one mode of production to another are problems of a more general synchrony than that of the mode of production itself, englobing several systems and their relations.&lt;ref name="Balibar, p.307"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the Greek political sociologist and structural Marxist [[Nicos Poulantzas]], forms of socio-cultural difference such as "territory and historico-cultural tradition [...] produce the uneven development of capitalism as an unevenness of historical moments affecting those differentiated, classified and distinct spaces that are called nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Henri Lefebvre and Ernest Mandel===
Althusser and Balibar's contemporary, Henri Lefebvre, was sharply critical of what he saw as these writers' fetishization of a fixed, abstract and purely structural notion of "general" synchronic space subsuming diachronic or historical processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-631-18331-0
|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Lefebvre's own "turbulent ''spatiality''"&lt;ref name="Gregory, p.356"&gt;Gregory, ''Geographical Imaginations'', p.356.&lt;/ref&gt; which "would restore geography to history, history to geography",&lt;ref name="Gregory, p.356"/&gt; together with his [[rhythmanalysis]], shares at least a common vocabulary with Bloch's multispatial and multitemporal dialectics. Lefebvre was also one of the first commentators to link uneven development to the production of space on a global scale: "The law of unevenness of growth and development, so far from becoming obsolete, is becoming world-wide in its application — or, more precisely is presiding over the globalization of a world market".&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, ''The Production of Space'', 1991 (1975), p.335 cited in Harootunian, "Some Thoughts on Comparability and the Space-Time Problem", p.42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Belgian Marxist [[Ernest Mandel]] was developing, at the same time as Lefebvre, a characterization of "late capitalism" which also refuses the idea that (global) capitalism produces homogeneity. Instead, he argues, capitalism must ''produce'' "underdevelopment" in order to maximize the production of surplus profit:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The entire capitalist system thus appears as a hierarchical structure of different levels of productivity, and as the outcome of the uneven and combined development of states, regions, branches of industry and firms, unleashed by the quest for surplus-profit. It forms an integrated unity, but it is an integrated unity of non-homogeneous parts, and it is precisely the unity that here determines the lack of homogeneity. In this whole system development and underdevelopment reciprocally determine each other, for while the quest for surplus-profits constitutes the prime motive power behind the mechanisms of growth, surplus-profit can only be achieved at the expense of less productive regions and branches of production.&lt;ref name="Mandel1975"&gt;{{cite book

===In theories of modernity and postmodernity===
Perhaps the most famous use of Bloch's terminology to date is that made by the Marxist cultural critic [[Fredric Jameson]] when describing the economic basis of [[modernism]] in ''Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism'' (1991):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Modernism must thus be seen as uniquely corresponding to an uneven moment of social development, or to what Ernst Bloch called the "simultaneity of the nonsimultaneous," the "synchronicity of the nonsynchronous" (''Gleichzeitigkeit des Ungleichzeitigen''): the coexistence of realities from radically different moments of history — handicrafts alongside the great cartels, peasant fields with the Krupp factories or the Ford plant in the distance.&lt;ref name="Jameson1991" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jameson goes on, however, to argue that with the advent of postmodernity and its attendant [[postmodernism]]s, the "uneven moment" of [[modernity]] has been completely replaced by the mass standardization and homogenization of the third, multinational, phase of capitalist development:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the postmodern must be characterized as a situation in which the survival, the residue, the holdover, the archaic, has finally been swept away without a trace. In the postmodern, then, the past itself has disappeared (along with the well-known "sense of the past" or historicity and collective memory). Where its buildings still remain, renovation and restoration allow them to be transferred to the present in their entirety as those other, very different and postmodern things called ''simulacra''. Everything is now organized and planned; nature has been triumphantly blotted out, along with peasants, petit-bourgeois commerce, handicraft, feudal aristocracies and imperial bureaucracies. Ours is a more homogeneously modernized condition; we no longer are encumbered with the embarrassment of non-simultaneities and non-synchronicities. Everything has reached the same hour on the great clock of development or rationalization (at least from the perspective of the "West"). This is the sense in which we can affirm, either that modernism is characterized by a situation of incomplete ''modernization'', or that postmodernism is more modern than modernism itself.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, ''Postmodernism'', pp.309–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In postcolonial theory===
[[Subaltern studies]] and postcolonial theory, however, tend to maintain that the idea of a globally homogenized space, even under postmodernity, is undercut precisely by Bloch's "nonsynchronous remnants" and diverse temporalities. [[Homi K. Bhabha]], commenting on Jameson, claims that

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is manifestly new about this version of international space and its social (in)visibility is its temporal measure [...] The non-synchronous temporality of global and national cultures opens up a cultural space — a third space — where the negotiation of incommensurable differences creates a tension peculiar to borderline existences.&lt;ref name="Bhabha1994"&gt;{{cite book

Postcolonial anthropologist [[Arjun Appadurai]] makes a similar point in his book ''Modernity at Large'' (1996) via an implicit critique of Wallerstein: "The new global cultural economy has to be seen as a complex, overlapping, disjunctive order that cannot any longer be understood in terms of existing center-periphery models (even those that might account for multiple centers and peripheries)".&lt;ref name="Appadurai1996"&gt;{{cite book

'''''Pari passu''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase that literally means "with an equal step" or "on equal footing". It is sometimes translated as "ranking equally",&lt;ref name="Harriman"&gt;{{cite book | title=Harriman's Financial Dictionary: Over 2,600 Essential Financial Terms | author=Briscoe, Simon | year=2007 | pages=348 | author2=Fuller, Jane | quote=Ranking equally, meaning literally 'with equal step'. }}&lt;/ref&gt; "hand-in-hand", "with equal force", or "moving together", and by extension, "fairly", "without partiality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pari passu|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/pari-passu.html|website=Business Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
:* ''[[Wiktionary:par#Inflection_2|pari]]'' is the [[ablative]] [[Singular number|singular]] [[masculine]] (since it must grammatically agree with ''passu'') of the [[adjective]] ''par'', "equal". If it were [[nominative]], "an equal step" it would be ''par passus''.
:* ''[[Wiktionary:passus#Inflection|passu]]'' is the [[ablative]] of the Latin noun ''passus'', "step".

This term is commonly used in law. ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (8th ed., 2004) defines ''pari passu'' as "proportionally; at an equal pace; without preference". 

==Usage==
===In inheritance===
In inheritance, an ''in pari passu'' (''[[per capita]]'') distribution can be distinguished from a ''[[per stirpes]]'' (by family branch) distribution.&lt;ref name="per stirpes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Black's Law Dictionary |url=http://thelawdictionary.org/per-stirpes/ |work=2nd Edition|publisher=West Publishing|accessdate=10 December 2012|author=Henry Campbell Black}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, suppose a [[testator]] had two children A and B. A has two children, and B has three. The testator leaves his entire estate to his grandchildren in equal shares ''in pari passu'', each grandchild would inherit one fifth of the estate. If the testator left his entire estate to his grandchildren ''per stirpes'' (by family branch), the children of A would share one half of the estate equally between the two of them, and the children of B would share one half of the estate equally amongst the three of them. 

The problem with a per capita ''in pari passu'' distribution in the example given is as follows. Assume A dies before B. On A's death a distribution could not be made to his or her children: they would have to await the death of B &amp;ndash; on the assumption that B could have additional children, and thereby consequently all grandchildren (of both A and B) would be entitled to less than one fifth each.

===In lending, bankruptcy and default===
This term is also often used in the [[lending]] area and in [[bankruptcy]] proceedings, where [[creditors]] are said to be paid ''pari passu'', or each creditor is paid ''[[pro rata]]'' in accordance with the amount of his claim. Here its meaning is "equally and without preference".
There have been cases where decisions were based on different interpretations of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Devi Sookun  Stop [[Vulture fund|Vulture Fund]] Lawsuits: A Handbook 2010 p34 2010 "The case succeeded because the court departed from the traditional meaning of the term pari passu. This section looks first at the original case of Elliott Associates v Republic of Peru."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd's maritime and commercial law quarterly 1983 "Obviously Lord Scott, in leaving out the preferential creditors, does not use the term pari passu in its multi-layered sense. Instead, his Lordship was referring to pari passu in its orthodox meaning."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]], as the result of the [[Greek government-debt crisis]], a retroactive [[Collective action clause]] passed by the Greek government with the support of the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] and [[IMF]], enabled the debtor (who also controlled the courts) to impose a 70% loss on the creditors, more than 75% of whom had voted in favour of the cut.  In this case, ''pari passu'' means that all private-sector investors are equally treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stevis|first1=Matina|last2=Burne|first2=Katy|title=Greek Legal Maneuvers Raise Fears of Euro-Zone Debt Fallout|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/eurocrisis/2012/02/23/greek-legal-maneuvers-raise-fears-of-euro-zone-debt-fallout/|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Stewart Williamson''' (born 1948) is a controversial [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] priest in the [[Church of England]]. He has brought high-profile civil suits in English courts over matters of Anglican faith and practice, including the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|ordination of women to the priesthood]] and the legality of the marriage of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] to [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]].

==Early life and education==
Williamson was born in 1948. He studied [[theology]] at [[King's College London]], and graduated in 1971 with a [[Bachelor of Divinity]] (BD) degree and the [[Associateship of King's College]] (AKC).&lt;ref name="crockford" /&gt;

==Ordained ministry==
Williamson was [[ordained]] in the [[Church of England]] as a [[deacon]] in 1972 and as a [[priest]] in 1973. From 1972 to 1975, he served his [[curacy]] at [[St Paul's, Deptford]] in the [[Anglican Diocese of Southwark|Diocese of Southwark]]. He was an honorary curate of [[St John the Divine, Kennington]] between 1976 and 1977.&lt;ref name="crockford"&gt;{{Crockford| surname = Williamson | forenames = Paul Stewart | id = 28086 | accessed = 30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Williamson moved to the [[Diocese of London]]. He served as a curate at Holy Trinity with St Mary, [[Hoxton]] from 1978 to 1983, at [[All Saints, Margaret Street]] from 1983 to 1984, and at St Mary's, [[Willesden]] from 1984 to 1985. For the next three years, he was not attached to any parish but held [[Permission to Officiate]] in the diocese. In 1989, he joined [[St George's Church, Hanworth|St George's Church]], [[Hanworth]] as a curate. Since 1992, he has been [[Priest-in-Charge]] of St George's.&lt;ref name="crockford" /&gt;

Williamson is an [[Anglo-Catholic]]. He is a member of the [[Society of Mary (Anglican)|Society of Mary]].

==Activism==
Williamson is a well-known opponent of the [[ordination of women]] to the priesthood. In 1997 he sued the Dean and Chapter of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] for appointing a woman as a [[minor canon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/frailty-thy-name-is-williamson-1267226.html|title=Frailty, thy name is Williamson|work=The Independent|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 July 1997, he was declared to be a [[vexatious litigant]] by justice [[Christopher Rose (judge)|Christopher Rose]] at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infotextmanuscripts.org/vexatiouslitigant/vex_lit_queens_bench_williamson.html|title=VEXATIOUS LITIGANT - ATTORNEY GENERAL v WILLIAMSON|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he is no longer allowed to bring action within the Courts of England and Wales without permission.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/vexatious-litigants&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Williamson protested against the legality of [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Camilla Parker Bowles|the marriage]] of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] to [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]].&lt;ref name="Guardian - Turbulent priest"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dutta|first1=Kunal|title=Turbulent priest|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/feb/25/religion.monarchy|accessdate=30 October 2015|work=The Guardian|date=25 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, with others, Williamson challenged a major grant by the [[Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament]] to the [[Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham]]. The Charity Commission for England and Wales, which described the complainants as "a substantial number", subsequently ruled that the grant had been unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;The ruling of the Charity Commission for England &amp; Wales is available in full [http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Our_regulatory_activity/Compliance_reports/fdcase.aspx#54 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2015, Williamson interrupted the consecration service for the Church of England's first woman to become a bishop, [[Libby Lane]], at [[York Minster]]. His objection was responded to by [[John Sentamu]], [[Archbishop of York]] (who was officiating) and the service continued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11369400/Rev-Libby-Lane-consecrated-as-Church-of-Englands-first-female-bishop.html ''The Telegraph''], 26 January 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Taxation}}

A '''poll tax''', also known as '''head tax''' or '''capitation''', is a [[tax]] levied as a fixed sum on every liable individual.&lt;!-- A poll tax based on the modern meaning of "poll" is a tax levied as a precondition for registering to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Head taxes were important sources of revenue for many governments from ancient times until the 19th century.{{citation needed}} In the United Kingdom, poll taxes were levied by the governments of [[John of Gaunt]] in the 14th century{{citation needed}}, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in the 17th{{citation needed}} and [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the 20th century{{citation needed}}. In the United States, voting poll taxes have been used to [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchise]] impoverished and minority voters (especially under [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]).&lt;ref&gt;Reconstruction After the Civil War by John Hope Franklin, U. of Chicago Press, 1961,pp. 127-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poll taxes are considered{{by whom?}} very [[regressive tax]]es, and are usually very unpopular and have been implicated in many uprisings.{{citation needed}}

The word "poll" is an archaic term for "head" or "top of the head".[[citation needed]] The sense of "counting heads" is found in phrases like [[polling place]] and [[opinion poll]].&lt;ref&gt;Nick Moon, ''Opinion Polls: History, Theory and Practice'' (Manchester University Press, 1999), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious law==

===Mosaic law===
As prescribed in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] (30: 11-16) [[Jewish law]] imposed a poll tax of half-[[shekel]], payable by every man above the age of twenty ("the rich shall not pay more and the poor shall not pay less").

{{quote|Exodus 30:11-16:

11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

12 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.

13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty [[gerah]]s:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.

14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.

15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.

16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. ([[Authorized Version]])|}}

The money was designated for the [[Tabernacle]] in the Exodus narrative and later for the upkeep of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]]. Priests, women, slaves and minors were exempted, although they could offer it voluntarily. Payment by [[Samaritans]] or [[Gentiles]] was rejected. It was collected yearly during the month of [[Adar]], both at the Temple and at special collection bureaux in the provinces.

===Islamic law===
[[Zakat al-Fitr]] is an obligatory charity that must be given by every Muslim (or their guardian) near the end of every [[Ramadan]]. Muslims in dire poverty are exempt from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sociology of Islam: Secularism, Economy and Politics|author=Tugrul Keskin|page=449|year=2012|publisher=UWA Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount is 2 kg of wheat or barley, or its cash equivalent. Zakat al-Fitr is to be given to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of American Islam|author=Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad, Jane I. Smith|page=166|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jizya]] was a poll tax imposed under [[Islamic law]] on non-Muslims permanently residing in a Muslim state as part of their ''[[dhimmi]]'' status. The tax is levied on free-born abled-bodied men of military age. The indigent were exempt, as well as slaves, women, children, the old, the sick, monks and hermits.

Several rationales for the jizya have been advanced. They include the argument that jizya was a fee in exchange for the dhimma (permission to practice one's faith, enjoy communal autonomy, and to be entitled to Muslim protection from outside aggression), and the argument that imposition of jizya on non-Muslims is similar to the imposition of [[zakat]] (one of the Five Pillars of Islam, an obligatory wealth tax paid on certain assets which are not used productively for a period of a year) on Muslims.

Although jizya is often called a poll tax, its assessment and collection was commonly qualified by income. For instance, [[Amr ibn al-As]], after conquering Egypt, set up a census to measure the population for the jizya, and thus the total expected jizya revenue for the whole province, but organized the actual collection by partitioning the population into wealth classes, so that the rich paid more and the poor less jizya of that total sum. Elsewhere, it is reported customary to partition into three classes, e.g. 48 [[dirhams]] for the rich, 24 for middle class and 12 for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Mannan ''Islamic Economics: Theory and Practice'', p.247&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, the [[Ottoman Empire]] abolished the jizya tax, as part of reforms to equalize the status of Muslims and non-Muslims. It was replaced by a military-exemption tax on non-Muslims, the Bedel-i Askeri.

==Canada==
{{Main article|Chinese head tax in Canada}}
The [[Chinese head tax]] was a fixed fee charged to each [[China|Chinese]] person entering [[Canada]]. The [[tax per head|head tax]] was first levied after the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]] passed the [[Chinese Immigration Act of 1885]] and was meant to discourage Chinese people from entering Canada after the completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. The tax was abolished by the [[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923]], which stopped all Chinese immigration except for business people, clergy, educators, students, and other categories.&lt;ref name="JamesMorton"&gt;James Morton. "[[In the Sea of Sterile Mountains: The Chinese in British Columbia]]". Vancouver, BC: J.J. Douglas, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Scotland==
The poll tax was essentially a lay subsidy (a tax on the [[movable property]] of most of the population) to help fund war. It had first been levied in 1275 and continued, under different names, until the 17th century. People were taxed a [[percentage]] of the assessed value of their movable goods. That percentage varied from year to year and place to place, and which goods could be taxed differed between [[urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] locations. [[Churchmen]] were exempt, as were the poor, workers in the [[Royal Mint]], inhabitants of the [[Cinque Ports]], [[tin]] workers in [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]], and those who lived in the [[County palatine|Palatinate counties]] of [[Cheshire]] and [[County Durham|Durham]].

===14th century===
The Hilary Parliament, held between January and March 1377, levied a poll tax in 1377 to finance the war against [[France]] at the request of [[John of Gaunt]] who, since [[King Edward III]] was mortally sick, was the de facto head of government at the time. This tax covered almost 60% of the population, far more than lay subsidies had earlier. It was levied two more times after 1377, in 1379 and 1381. Each time the taxation basis was slightly different. In 1377, every lay person over the age of 14 years who was not a beggar had to pay a [[groat (coin)|groat]] (4d) to the Crown. By 1379 that had been graded by social class, with the lower age limit changed to 16, and to 15 two years later. The levy of 1381 operated under a combination of both flat rate and graduated assessments. The minimum amount payable was set at 4d, however tax collectors had to account for a 12d a head mean assessment. Payments were therefore variable; the poorest in theory would pay the lowest rate with the deficit being met by a higher payment from those able to afford it. &lt;ref&gt; See Carolyn Christine Fenwick, “The English Poll Taxes of 1377, 1379 and 1381: A Critical Examination of the Returns” (London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London), 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1381 tax has been credited as one of the main reasons behind the [[Peasants Revolt|Peasants' Revolt]] in that year, due in part to attempts to restore feudal conditions in rural areas.

===17th century===
The poll tax was resurrected during the 17th century, usually related to a military emergency. It was imposed by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1641 to finance the raising of the army against the Scottish and Irish uprisings. With the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660, the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament of 1660]] instituted a poll tax to finance the disbanding of the [[New Model Army]] (pay arrears, etc.) (12 Charles II c.9).&lt;ref&gt;''Statutes of the Realm'', vol. v, p.207-225&lt;/ref&gt; The poll tax was assessed according to "rank", e.g. dukes paid £100, earls £60, knights £20, esquires £10. Eldest sons paid 2/3rds of their father's rank, widows paid a third of their late husband's rank. The members of the [[livery companies]] paid according to company's rank (e.g. masters of first-tier guilds like the Mercers paid £10, whereas masters of fifth-tier guilds, like the Clerks, paid 5 shillings). Professionals also paid differing rates, e.g. physicians (£10), judges (£20), advocates (£5), attorneys (£3), and so on. Anyone with property (land, etc.) paid 40 shillings per £100 earned, anyone over the age of 16 and unmarried paid 12-pence and everyone else over 16 paid 6-pence.

The poll tax was imposed again by [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] in 1689 (1 Will. &amp; Mar. c.13), reassessed in 1690 adjusting rank for fortune, and then again in 1691 back to rank irrespective of fortune. The poll tax was imposed again in 1692, and one final time in 1698 (the last poll tax in England until the 20th century). A poll tax was imposed on Scotland between 1694 and 1699.

As the greater weight of the 17th century poll taxes fell primarily upon the wealthy and powerful, it was not too unpopular. There were grumblings within the taxed ranks about lack of differentiation by income within ranks. Ultimately, it was the inefficiency of their collection – what they brought in routinely fell far short of expected revenues – that prompted the government to abandon the poll tax after 1698.

Far more controversial was the [[hearth tax]] introduced in 1662 (13 &amp; 14 Charles II c.10), which imposed a hefty two shillings on every hearth in a family dwelling (which was easier to count than persons). Heavier, more permanent and more regressive than the poll tax proper, the intrusive entry of tax inspectors into private homes to count hearths was a very sore point, and it was promptly repealed with the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1689. It was replaced with a "window tax" in 1695 (inspectors could count windows from outside homes).

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Poll tax (Great Britain)}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Militant tendency]] --&gt;
The Community Charge, unofficially known as the "Poll Tax" , was a tax to fund [[local government in the United Kingdom]], instituted in 1989 by the government of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. It replaced the [[rates (tax)|rates]] that were based on the notional rental value of a house. The abolition of rates was in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] manifesto for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], and the replacement was proposed in the Green Paper of 1986, ''Paying for Local Government'' based on ideas developed by [[Madsen Pirie|Dr. Madsen Pirie]] and [[Douglas Mason]] of the [[Adam Smith Institute]]. It was a [[fixed tax]] per adult resident, but there was a reduction for those with lower household income. Each person was to pay for the services provided in their community. This proposal was contained in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] [[Manifesto]] for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]]. The new tax replaced the rates in Scotland from the start of the 1989/90 financial year, and in England and Wales from the start of the 1990/91 financial year.

The system was unpopular. Many thought it shifted the tax burden from the rich to the poor, as it was based on the number of occupants living in a house rather than on the estimated market value of the house. Many tax rates set by local councils proved to be much higher than earlier predictions; this led to resentment, even among some who had supported the introduction of it. The tax in different boroughs differed because local taxes paid by businesses varied and grants by central government to local authorities sometimes varied capriciously.

Mass protests were called by the [[All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation]], with which the vast majority of local [[Anti-Poll Tax Unions]] (APTUs) were affiliated. In Scotland, the APTUs called for mass non-payment and these calls rapidly gathered widespread support which spread as far as [[England and Wales]], even though non-payment meant that people could be prosecuted. In some areas, 30% of former ratepayers defaulted. While [[owner-occupier]]s were easy to tax, those who regularly changed accommodation were almost impossible to pursue if they chose not to pay. The cost of collecting the tax rose steeply while the returns from it fell. Unrest grew and resulted in a number of [[poll tax riots]]. The most serious was in a protest at [[Trafalgar Square]], London, on 31 March 1990, of more than 200,000 protesters. [[Terry Fields]],  Labour MP for [[Liverpool Broadgreen (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Broadgreen]]; was jailed for 60 days for his refusal to pay the poll tax.

This unrest led, in part, to the end of Thatcher's premiership. Her successor, [[John Major]], replaced the poll tax with the [[Council Tax]], similar to the rating system that preceded the Poll Tax. The main differences were that it was levied on capital value rather than notional rental value of a property, and that it had a 25% discount for single-occupancy dwellings.

In 2015  Lord Waldegrave reflected in his memoirs that the poll tax was all his own work and that it was a serious mistake. Although he felt the policy looked like it would work, it wasn't implemented how he thought it would be. "They went gung ho and introduced it overnight in one go, which was never my plan and I thought they must know what there were doing - but they didn't." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-33594395&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
In France, a poll tax, the '''''capitation''''', was first imposed by King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1695 as a temporary measure to finance the [[War of the League of Augsburg]], and thus repealed in 1699.  It was resumed during the [[War of Spanish Succession]] and in 1704 set on a permanent basis, remaining until the end of the ''[[Ancien regime]]''.

Like the English poll tax, the French capitation tax was assessed on rank – for taxation persons, French society was divided in twenty-two "classes", with the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] (a class by himself) paying 2,000 [[French livre|livres]], princes of the blood paying 1500 livres, and so on down to the lowest class, composed of day laborers and servants, who paid 1 livre each. The bulk of the common population was covered by four classes, paying 40, 30, 10 and 3 livres respectively. Unlike most other direct French taxes, nobles and clergy were not exempted from capitation taxes. It did, however, exempt the [[mendicant order]]s and the poor who contributed less than 40 sous.

The French clergy managed to temporarily escape capitation assessment by promising to pay a total sum of 4 million livres per annum in 1695, and then obtained permanent exemption in 1709 with a lump sum payment of 24 million livres. The ''[[Pays d'états]]'' (Brittany, Burgundy, etc.) and many towns also escaped assessment by promising annual fixed payments. The nobles did not escape assessment, but they obtained the right to appoint their own capitation tax assessors, which allowed them to escape most of the burden (in one calculation, they escaped ⅞ of it).

Compounding the burden, the assessment on the capitation did not remain stable. The ''pays de taille personelle'' (basically, [[Pays d'élection]], the bulk of France and Aquitaine) secured the ability to assess the capitation tax proportionally to the taille – which effectively meant adjusting the burden heavily against the lower classes. According to the estimates of [[Jacques Necker]] in 1788, the capitation tax was so riddled in practice, that the privileged classes (nobles and clergy and towns) were largely exempt, while the lower classes were heavily crushed: the lowest peasant class, originally assessed to pay 3 livres, were now paying 24, the second lowest, assessed at 10 livres, were now paying 60 and the third-lowest assessed at 30 were paying 180. The total collection from the capitation, according to Necker in 1788, was 41 million livres, well short of the 54 million estimate, and it was projected that the revenues could have doubled if the exemptions were revoked and the original 1695 assessment properly restored.

The old capitation tax was repealed with the [[French Revolution]] and replaced, on January 13 1791&lt;ref&gt;Jones C, 2013, The Longman Companion to the French Revolution, Addison Wesley Longman limited, London https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xcXKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=contribution+fonciere+date+introduced+revolution&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E7FAxB4DMg&amp;sig=BecAtoSj11znheyxp_JwESHRYwg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik77yUxYbXAhXBbbwKHQePAqAQ6AEIMzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=contribution%20fonciere%20date%20introduced%20revolution&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;, with a new poll tax as part of the ''contribution personnelle mobilière'', which lasted well into the late 19th century. It was fixed for every individual at "three days's labor" (assessed locally, but by statute, no less than 1 franc 50 centimes and no more than 4 francs 50 centimes, depending on the area). A dwelling tax (''impôt sur les portes et fenêtres'', similar to the English window-tax) was imposed in 1791.

==Roman Empire==
{{see also|List of Roman taxes}}
The [[ancient Romans]] imposed a ''tributum capitis'' (poll tax) as one of the principal direct taxes on the peoples of the Roman provinces (''Digest'' 50, tit.15). In the Republican period, poll taxes were principally collected by private [[Tax farming|tax farmers]] (''[[publican]]i''), but from the time of Emperor [[Augustus]], the collections were gradually transferred to magistrates and the senates of provincial cities. The Roman [[census]] was conducted periodically in the provinces to draw up and update the poll tax register.

The Roman poll tax fell principally on Roman subjects in the provinces, but not on Roman citizens. Towns in the provinces who possessed the ''Jus Italicum'' (enjoying the "privileges of Italy") were exempted from the poll tax. The 212 edict of Emperor [[Caracalla]] which formally conferred Roman citizenship on all residents of Roman provinces, did not however exempt them from the poll tax.

The Roman poll tax was deeply resented—[[Tertullian]] bewailed the poll tax as a "badge of slavery"—and it provoked numerous revolts in the provinces. Perhaps most famous is the [[First Jewish Revolt|Zealot revolt]] in [[Judaea]] of 66 AD. After the [[destruction of the temple]] in 70 AD, the Emperor imposed an extra poll tax on Jews throughout the empire, the ''[[Fiscus Judaicus|fiscus judaicus]]'', of two [[denarius|denarii]] each.

The Italian revolt of the 720s, organized and led by [[Pope Gregory II]], was originally provoked by the attempt of the Constantinople Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] to introduce a poll tax in the [[Exarchate of Ravenna|Italian provinces]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 722, and set in motion the permanent separation of Italy from the Byzantine empire. When King [[Aistulf]] of the [[Lombards]] availed himself of the Italian dissent and invaded the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] in 751, one of his first acts was to institute a crushing poll tax of one gold [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]] per head on every Roman citizen. Seeking relief from this burden, [[Pope Stephen II]] appealed to [[Pepin the Short]] of the [[Franks]] for assistance, that led to the establishment of the [[Papal States]] in 756.

===Poll tax===
{{main article|Poll taxes in the United States}}
[[File:PollTaxRecieptJefferson1917.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Receipt for payment of poll tax, [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana]], 1917 (the $1 tax has the purchasing power of ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1|1917|r=2}}}} today)]]

Prior to the mid 20th century, a poll tax was implemented in some U.S. state and local jurisdictions and paying it was a pre-condition before one could exercise their [[Voting rights in the United States|right to vote]]. After this right was extended to all races by the [[ratification]] of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the Constitution, many Southern states enacted poll tax laws as a means of restricting eligible voters; such laws often included a [[grandfather clause]], which allowed any adult male whose father or grandfather had voted in a specific year prior to the abolition of slavery to vote without paying the tax. These laws, along with [[literacy tests]] and extra-legal intimidation,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crmvet.org/info/lithome.htm&lt;/ref&gt; achieved the desired effect of [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising African-Americans]], as well as poor whites. Often in US discussions, the term ''poll tax'' is used to mean a tax that must be paid in order to vote, rather than a capitation tax simply. The [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]], ratified in 1964, prohibits both [[US Congress|Congress]] and the [[State legislature (United States)|states]] from conditioning the right to vote on payment of a poll tax or other types of tax.

===Capitation and federal taxation===
{{Main article|Taxation in the United States}}

The [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Limits on Congress|ninth section]] of Article One of the Constitution places several limits on Congress' powers. Among them, "No capitation, or other direct, tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken". Capitation here means a tax of a uniform, fixed amount per taxpayer.&lt;ref name="US State Dept constitution"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government levied direct taxes from time to time during the 18th and early 19th centuries. It levied direct taxes on the owners of houses, land, slaves and estates in the late 1790s but cancelled the taxes in 1802.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

An income tax is neither a poll tax nor a capitation, as the amount of tax will vary from person to person, depending on each person's income. Until a United States Supreme Court decision in 1895, all income taxes were deemed to be excises (i.e., indirect taxes). The [[Revenue Act of 1861]] established the first [[income tax]] in the United States, to pay for the cost of the [[American Civil War]]. This income tax was abolished after the war, in 1872. Another income tax statute in 1894 was overturned in ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.]]'' in 1895, where the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] held that income taxes on income from property, such as rent income, interest income, and dividend income (however excepting income taxes on income from "occupations and labor" if only for the reason of not having been challenged in the case, "We have considered the act only in respect of the tax on income derived from real estate, and from invested personal property") were to be treated as direct taxes. Because the statute in question had not apportioned income taxes on income from property by population, the statute was ruled unconstitutional. Finally, [[ratification]] of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1913 made possible modern income taxes, by limiting the Sixteenth Amendment income tax to the class of indirect excises (i.e. excises, duties, and imposts) – thus requiring no apportionment,&lt;ref name="BRUSHABER v.

'''Rameshwari Photocopy Services''' is a shop licensed to it within the precincts of the [[Delhi School of Economics]] ([[University of Delhi]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/114459608/|title=The Chancellor, Masters &amp; ... vs Rameshwari Photocopy Services &amp; ... on 9 December, 2016|website=indiankanoon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came into limelight due to copyright litigation filed by five prominent publishers which included [[Oxford University Press]], [[Cambridge University Press]] and [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=bb41f1ab-d0b8-4706-8b7b-87342c645351|title=The Appeal Bench’s decision Delhi university photocopying case: fair use re-visited - Lexology|first=|last=Krishna &amp; Saurastri Associates LLP - Janhvi Chadha|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case also colloquially came to be known as the 'DU Photocopy Case'.

Albeit with an initial denial by the University of Delhi, the ultimate picture which
emerged was that the professors imparting teaching in the Delhi School of
Economics had authorized preparation of [[Coursepacks|course packs]] and Rameshwari
Photocopy Services was entrusted with the task of photocopying the pages
from the books published by the plaintiffs, and after binding the same, to
supply them to the students charging 50 paisa per page.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Rameshwari Photocopy shop background==
Rameshwari Photocopy shop was established in 1998 and is owned by Mr. Dharampal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/a-day-in-the-life-of-rameshwari-photocopy-service-shop-delhi-university-4432772/|title=A day in the life of Rameshwari Photocopy Service shop, Delhi University|date=18 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impleadment==
Association of Students for Equitable Access to Knowledge (ASEAK) and Society for Promoting Educational Access and Knowledge (SPEAK) sought and allowd for impleadment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lobis.nic.in/ddir/dhc/RSE/judgement/16-09-2016/RSE16092016S24392012.pdf | title=The Chancellor, Masters &amp; Scholars of the University of Oxford &amp; Ors. vs Rameshwari Photocopy Services &amp; ANR. | publisher=High Court of Delhi | date=16 September 2016 | accessdate=3 September 2018 }} See Point 11 and Point 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case of the plaintiffs==
The case of the plaintiffs that the inclusion of specific pages of its
publications by Rameshwari Photocopy Services, under the authority of the
Delhi School of Economics, amounts to institutional sanction for
infringement of its copyright.

It is the further case of the plaintiffs that the
professors of the Delhi School of Economics, through its Library, issued the
books published by the plaintiffs to Rameshwari Photocopy Services for
preparing course packs.

It is the case of the plaintiffs that the [[Coursepacks|course packs]],
which contain no additional material apart from photocopies of its
copyrighted publications, were being used like textbooks and therefore, the
compilations prepared were competing with the publications of the plaintiffs.

According to the plaintiffs, Rameshwari Photocopy Services was operating
commercially as was evident from the rate charged by it for selling the course
pack is 40/50 paisa per page, as distinct from the market rate of 20/25 paisa
per page being charged by other photocopiers from the students while
photocopying material given by the students to be photocopied.

Anticipating that the defence would be predicated under Section 52(1)(i) of the [[Copyright Act, 1957]], the plaintiffs have pleaded that Section 52(1)(i) was not applicable since reproduction by Rameshwari Photocopy Services, with the assistance of Delhi School of Economics, could not be classified as reproduction by a
teacher or a pupil in the course of instruction. Additionally/alternatively the reproduction in the manner carried out by Rameshwari Photocopy Services if held falling within the ambit of Section 52(1)(i) would render Section 52(1)(h) superfluous was the contention. Meaning thereby, the plaintiffs had required the two sub-Sections to be harmonized. The plaintiffs have further
pleaded that Section 52(1)(i) only covered reproduction in the course of
instruction‘ and not in the course of preparation for instruction‘ as was
evident from the replacement of the expression in the course of preparation
for instruction‘ in the Bill which was tabled before the Legislature with the
expression in the course of instruction‘ in the Act as finally promulgated
upon the Bill being adopted; with modifications by the Legislature.
According to the plaintiffs, reproduction by Rameshwari Photocopy Services
fell within the ambit of Section 52(1)(h) and would have to be limited to two
passages from works by the same author published by the same publisher
during any period of five years as provided under the sub-Section.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;lobis.nic.in/ddir/dhc/PNJ/judgement/09-12-2016/PNJ09122016RFAOS812016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defence==
Rameshwari Photocopy Services contested the copyright of the
plaintiffs in the books from which the [[Coursepacks|course packs]] were prepared.
Rameshwari Photocopy Services pleaded that the preparation of course packs
by it amounts to fair use within the meaning of Sections 52(1)(a) and (h) of the [[Copyright Act, 1957]]. Rameshwari Photocopy Services pleaded that its activity does not affect the market for the plaintiffs’ books since it charges a nominal rate for its services as fixed by the License Deed executed between the Delhi School of Economics and Rameshwari Photocopy Services. As per it, the students cannot afford to buy all the books, extracts of which were mentioned in the syllabi prepared by the Delhi School of Economics.

Apart from adopting the stand taken by Rameshwari Photocopy
Services, in its written statement, the University of Delhi pleaded that Section 52(1)(i) of the [[Copyright Act, 1957]] permits students and educational institutions to copy portions from any work for research and educational purpose. The University pleaded that Rameshwari Photocopy Services has been licensed by it to operate a photocopy shop within its premises in order to facilitate photocopying by students for educational and research purpose. Denying issuing books to Rameshwari Photocopy Services for the purposes of preparation of [[Coursepacks|course packs]], the University pleaded that no limitation on the quantum of reproduction under Section 52(1)(i) has been provided under the [[Copyright Act, 1957]] and because Section 52(1)(i) covers reproduction
for educational purposes, unlimited photocopying would be permitted. For
which argumentative pleadings reference to the limitation of two passages
provided under Section 52(1)(h) was highlighted. The argument was that
wherever the legislature had deemed fit, it had limited the extent of the
copying which was permissible. It was argued, by way of pleading, that the
term ‘reproduction‘ used in Section 52(1)(i) was distinct from the term
‘publication‘ used in Section 52(1)(h), with Section 3 of the Act defining
publication‘ as making a work available to the public‘, with the term
‘public‘ having a wider connotation than the term students‘ and therefore, Section 52(1)(h) would not be applicable to preparation of [[Coursepacks|course packs]] to be used by students for an educational purpose. University of Delhi pleaded that the expression course of instruction‘ must be interpreted expansively.

==Highlights of Delhi Highcourt judgement on 9 December 2016==
* Judgements Point No.31:"...unless the legislative intent  expressly excludes fair use, and especially when a person’s result of labour is being utilized by somebody else, fair use must be read into the statute..."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Judgements Point No.33 &amp; 35: "..In the context of teaching and use of copyrighted material, the fairness in the use can be determined on the touchstone of ‘extent justified by the purpose’...."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* "...that the four factors on which fair use is determined in jurisdictions abroad would guide fair use of copyrighted material during course of instruction.  The qualitative and quantitative test which is one of the four tests would not apply to clause (i).."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;    
* Judgements Point No. 57 clarifies difference between reproduction‘ and ‘publication‘ according to this ruling, "...Publication need not be for the benefit of or available to or meant for reading by all the members of the community.  A targeted audience would also be a public as rightly urged by learned counsel for the appellants. But, a publication would have the element of profit, which would be missing in the case of reproduction of a work by a teacher to be used in the course of instruction while imparting education to the pupils. That apart, if reproduction includes the plural, it cannot be held that making of multiple copies would be impermissible.  It happens in law that footprints of one concept fall in the territory of other but that does not mean that the former should be restricted.."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Announcement of withdrawing the suit==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11677">A '''Recorder''' is a judicial officer in [[England and Wales]] and some other [[common law]] jurisdictions.

==England and Wales==
In the courts of England and Wales the term Recorder has two distinct meanings.  The senior [[Circuit judge (England and Wales)|circuit judge]] of a borough or city is often awarded the title of "Honorary Recorder".  However, "Recorder" is also used to denote a barrister or solicitor who sits as a part-time circuit judge.
 
===Historic office===
In England and Wales, originally a recorder was a certain [[magistrate]] or [[judge]] having criminal and civil jurisdiction within the [[corporation]] of a city or [[borough]]. Such incorporated bodies were given the right by the Crown to appoint a recorder. He was a person with legal knowledge appointed by the mayor and [[aldermen]] of the corporation to 'record' the proceedings of their courts and the customs of the borough or city. Such recordings were regarded as the highest evidence of fact.&lt;ref&gt;Riley Munimenta Gildhallæ I. 42-3&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, the appointment would be given to a senior and distinguished practitioner at the Bar, and it was, therefore, usually executed part-time only, by a person whose usual practice was as a barrister.  It carried a great deal of prestige and power of patronage. The recorder of a borough was often entrusted by the mayor and corporation to nominate its [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]], as was the case with the [[Recorder of Barnstaple]], who in 1545 nominated the two MPs to represent the [[Barnstaple (UK Parliament constituency)|Borough of Barnstaple]].&lt;ref&gt;History of Parliament biography of  [[George Rolle]] (d.1552) of [[Stevenstone]], MP{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/rolle-george-1486-1552 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001055248/http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/rolle-george-1486-1552 |archivedate=2015-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only survival today of the historic office is the [[Recorder of London]] who is still appointed by the [[Court of Aldermen]] of the [[Corporation of the City of London]] and thereby becomes a member of that court. He is a senior Circuit Judge sitting at the Central Criminal Court (the [[Old Bailey]]).

===Titular and honorific recorders===
{{see also|List of honorary recorders}}
The ancient recorderships of England and Wales now form part of a system of honorary recorderships which are filled by the most senior full-time circuit judges. At each [[Crown Court]] centre, a particular judge is appointed "resident judge", leads the team of judges who sit there and provides the essential link between the judiciary and the administration. In the larger city court centres, the resident judge is usually a senior circuit judge who is recruited and appointed specifically to that post.  An exception is the [[Corporation of the City of London]] which still follows ancient custom as stated above.

In the many smaller towns and cities where the resident judge is not a senior circuit judge, the position is different. The resident judge is deployed specifically to that post by the Lord Chief Justice (with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor) from the ranks of the circuit bench.  They then hold office as resident judge for a set period, normally four years, although such appointments are renewable.
 
Whilst the appointment of an honorary recorder has lain with the borough council since the Courts Act 1971, in practice the resident judge is appointed as the honorary recorder.  In a borough that is coincident with an ancient assize the position is titular; that is, the resident judge is automatically entitled honorary recorder and continues to hold that title until their retirement from the post.

In the case where the resident judge is a fixed-term appointment, it is expected that the city or borough council will appoint them as honorary recorder for the duration of their tenure as resident judge. Boroughs which had a power by charter to appoint a recorder before 1971, but which had no quarter sessions, have a preserved right to appoint anyone, including non-lawyers, as honorary recorder, but an honorary recorder who is not a judge cannot sit as a judge in court or exercise any judicial functions.  The procedure to be followed is that laid down by the [[Lord Chief Justice]] in his "''Guidelines for the Appointment of Honorary Recorders''", which states that it has been the practice of most large city councils to appoint the resident judge to be honorary recorder of the city during his tenure of the office. Some new positions have been created since 1971, for example for the [[Borough of Redbridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://moderngov.redbridge.gov.uk/Published/C00000267/M00004450/AI00034013/$HonoraryRecorder.docA.ps.pdf moderngov.redbridge.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;
The appointment of an honorary recorder is made by the borough council concerned, and although it does not require the approval of a higher authority, the [[Lord Chief Justice]] has let it be known that he would be pleased if boroughs considering making such an appointment would first consult the Senior Presiding Judge for England and Wales.

Due to the reorganisation of courts, especially where local government reorganisation has occurred at the same time, some titles bestowed by one council may be held by the senior resident judge sitting in another borough; a prominent example is the Recorder of the [[City of Westminster]] who presides at the [[Crown Court]] situated in the [[London Borough of Southwark]].

The protocol of the use of the title is that it is customary for an honorary recorder, when sitting in the Crown Court in the city or town where he holds that office, to be described as such in the published court lists. This should not be done, however, when the judge is sitting in the Crown Court in another city or town, whether or not that city or town has an honorary recorder of its own.

[[File:Legal Service for Wales 2013 (105).JPG|thumbnail|[[Eleri Rees]], the Recorder of Cardiff (red robes), at a ceremonial event with circuit judges (purple robes)]]
Honorary recorders who are also senior circuit judges are authorised by the Lord Chief Justice to wear red robes when sitting in court. These robes are based on the design of the robes worn by judges of the county courts, but in red and black. They were designed for the recorders of Manchester and Liverpool in 1956. The right to wear them in court was extended in the 1980s to the other senior circuit judges appointed as honorary recorders, but has not been extended to those who are not senior circuit judges. Accordingly, when sitting in court, honorary recorders who are not senior circuit judges continue to wear the normal robes of a circuit judge sitting in the Crown Court.  In addition, honorary recorders who are also senior circuit judges are addressed in court as "My Lord/Lady" (as for a High Court Judge) instead of "Your Honour" (as for other circuit judges, including senior circuit judges who are not honorary recorders). In the law reports and in court lists an honorary recorder is usually styled "The Recorder of X".

===Recorders as part-time appointments===
Since 1971 the term "Recorder" has also been used for a part-time judicial appointment in England and Wales, providing part-time experience of judicial office. The part-time appointees were initially designated "Assistant Recorder", with a view to promotion to full "Recorder".  Appointments are no longer made to the position of Assistant Recorder.

Appointments are made by the Crown by Royal Warrant, on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor.  Since 2006 the Lord Chancellor's recommendations are based upon an independent appointments process by the Judicial Appointments Commission.
Eligibility is restricted to [[barrister]]s or [[solicitor]]s of at least seven years' standing.  A Recorder, when acting as such, has all the powers of a Circuit Judge and may sit in the [[Crown Court]] or in the [[County Court]]. A Recorder sitting in the Crown Court or County Court is addressed as "Your Honour" (save in the [[Old Bailey|Central Criminal Court (or Old Bailey)]] where all judges are addressed as "My Lord (or Lady)").  If appointed to do so under section 9(1) of the [[Senior Courts Act 1981]], a Recorder may sit as a part-time [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|High Court Judge]].

A Recorder is paid a daily fee and is expected to sit as a judge for between three and six weeks a year.

==In other jurisdictions==

===Ireland and Northern Ireland===
The [[Recorder of Dublin]]  was the principal magistrate for the city of [[Dublin]] until the office was abolished in 1924. The judicial offices of [[Recorder of Belfast]] and Recorder of [[Derry]] still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judiciary of Northern Ireland|url=https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/AboutUs/OrganisationalStructure/Pages/Judiciary-of-Northern-Ireland.aspx|publisher=Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service|accessdate=17 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111171210/https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/AboutUs/OrganisationalStructure/Pages/Judiciary-of-Northern-Ireland.aspx|archivedate=11 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also Recorders of Cork and Galway.

===Hong Kong===

Hong Kong operates a system of appointing part-time recorders similar to that in England &amp; Wales except that recorders are appointed to the [[High Court of Hong Kong]] and have the same powers as a full judge when sitting.  The qualification for appointment is the same as that for High Court Judge: that is, having practised as a [[barrister]] or [[solicitor]] in a [[common law]] jurisdiction for more than 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;S.6A and S.9 High Court Ordinance&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States and Canada===
In some U.S. and Canadian jurisdictions, the Recorder's Court is a local court of limited jurisdiction, most often hearing [[misdemeanor]]s, traffic violations, and other petty criminal offenses. The [[Recorder of New York City]] was one of the judges of the Court of General Sessions (the local court of general jurisdiction on criminal cases) and presided over most murder trials in [[New York City]].

==Historic usage==
In historic times, the recorder was the [[chancellor]] or [[vizier]] of the kingdom. He brought all weighty matters under the notice of the king, such as complaints, [[petition]]s, and wishes of [[British subject|subject]]s or foreigners. He also drew up papers for the king's guidance, and prepared drafts of the royal will for the [[scribe]]s. All [[Treaty|treaties]] came under his oversight; and he had the care of the national [[archives]] or records, to which, as royal [[historiographer]], he added the current [[annals]] of the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;M.G. Easton. "[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/easton/ebd2.html?term=Recorder Recorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021231126/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/easton/ebd2.html?term=Recorder |date=2012-10-21 }}."

Apart from religion, the Red Shirts also attacked other things they considered to be detrimental to progress, most notably [[alcohol]].

The Red Shirts have been described as "shock troops of indoctrination for the intense campaign against 'God and religion.'"&lt;ref name="Krauze"&gt;Krauze, Enrique [http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20060619&amp;s=krauze061906&amp;c=2 "The Troubling Roots of Mexico's Lopez Obrador: Tropical Messiah"], ''The New Republic'', June 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Shirts were also used against the [[Cristeros]] revolt, an uprising against the persecution of Catholics by the government of [[Plutarco Calles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/mexico/32.htm ''The Calles Presidency, 1924-28'' Country Studies, Mexico, U.S. Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Shirts practiced socialist marriages, and two Red Shirt members, José Correa and Victoria Ley, pronounced their own vows:

{{Quote|Before society, before Comrade Tomas Garrido Canabal, and all present, we declare that we have united in matrimony by our express will&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;Parsons, Wilfrid. ''Mexican Martyrdom''. Kessinger Publishing, 2003, pp. 238, 239, 241, 243.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And another two members sent out invitations:

{{Quote|J. Felix Gutierrez and Amalia Gonzalez have the honor to invite you to the civil and socialist matrimonial act, to take place at 21 o' clock the 17th of this month at 305 Gomez Farias Street. Please honor us...&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt;}}

The Red Shirts celebrated the death of Christ on Good Friday 1935&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt; and the connected League against Religious Fanaticism had their own radio show call "Anti-Fanatic Hour", which was made up of 12 parts, including the "Hymn To The Socialist School", the song "Anti-Alcoholic Protest" and six speeches (including one on "The Class Struggle").&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt; 

In 1934 Garrido was named secretary of Agriculture by the new president [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], hoping to contain the Red Shirts that way. However, Garrido took the Red Shirts with him to Mexico City at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] to intervene in student politics.&lt;ref name="historicaltextarchive.com"/&gt;

==Attacks==
On December 30, 1934, the Red Shirts opened fired on Catholic exiles who were seeking to return to Tabasco as they were leaving Mass at the Immaculate Conception Church in [[Coyoacán]], killing five and wounding many others.&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt; Garrido sent the murderers a case of Champagne in jail and declared that they were under his protection.&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt;

In 1935, after he ordered his Red Shirts to kill Catholic activists in Mexico City who were seeking to return to Tabasco, Garrido was forced to step down and into exile in [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref name="Krauze" /&gt; His paramilitary groups, including the Camisas Rojas, were subsequently disbanded.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

The Red Shirts hunt for a priest from Concepción, Tabasco, in [[Graham Greene]]'s 1940 novel ''[[The Power and the Glory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greene|first1=Graham|title=The Power and the Glory|date=1940|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=9780140184990|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his 10-year rule as Chief Minister, Hooda, licensed a massive 24,825 acres of land compared to just 8,550.32 acres by successive Chief Ministers in the 23 years preceding Hooda rule.&lt;ref name=uddar2&gt;[http://www.firstpost.com/politics/hooda-haryana-vadra-scam-huda-2781232.html Hooda’s land largesse for pvt builder ‘clear fraud’, SC restores it to HUDA], [[Firstpost]], 15 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
===Modus of scam===
Builders coerce farmers to sell their land by getting the government to use the Section 4 of the land law to have a government notification issued to the farmer that their land is required for the ''"public purpose"''. Builders try to acquire this land by offering a small premium above the government’s rate for the acquisition of the land. If landowners farmers still resist the sale, then Section 6 of land law is applied by declaring the government's intention to acquire land, which forces the reluctant farmers to sell the land to builders at small premium. Once the land is acquired by the builders, government cancels the acquisition process and releases the land to new build owners, along with the change in land use permission to build residential and industrial building on the farm land. This results in steep rise in the land prices, resulting in massive gains for the builders, opportunity cost loss to the farmers and land tax revenue loss to the government.&lt;ref name=uddar2/&gt; Robert Vadra and DLF were the beneficiary builders in Hooda's regime.&lt;ref name=scam1/&gt;

Vadra made an illegal profit of more than INR50 crore after buying 3 acre land for INR 7 crore and by onselling it to [[DLF (company)|DLF]] for INR 58 crore after a few months after Hooda's [[Indian National Congress]] government had granted a Change in Land Use license to convert its usage from agriculture to commercial.&lt;ref name=vad1/&gt;&lt;ref name=vad2/&gt; vadra has bought properties using unsecured loans from DLF.&lt;ref name=vad5&gt;[http://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-gandhi-son-in-law-robert-vadras-shady-haryana-land-dea/60119 All you need to know about Robert Vadra's shady Haryana land deal], Times Now, 22 Dec 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) government came to power in Haryana, the ''"Justice Dhingra Commission"'' was formed in 2015 to investigate the scam.&lt;ref name=vad1/&gt;&lt;ref name=vad2/&gt; Dhings Commission indicted Hooda.&lt;ref name=vad1/&gt;&lt;ref name=vad3&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/india/bhupinder-singh-hooda-fails-in-bid-to-block-report-on-dhingra-probe-into-land-deals-land-dlf-scam-vadra-4631254/ Bhupinder Singh Hooda fails in bid to block report on Dhingra probe into land deals], [[The Indian Express]], 27 Apr 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vad4&gt;[http://www.firstpost.com/india/justice-sn-dhingra-panel-report-on-robert-vadras-shady-land-deals-leaked-the-story-so-far-3410418.html Justice SN Dhingra panel report on Robert Vadra's 'shady' land deals leaked: The story so far], [[Firstpost]], 28 Apr 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Dingra Commission's report states that there was collusion aimed at benefiting Vadra’s company Skylight Hospitality, and it sought further inquiry.&lt;ref name=vad2/&gt; Consequently, the case was handed over to CBI for the further investigation.&lt;ref name=vad1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4918">In [[United States law]], ''[[City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.]]'' (1989) established the basic principle that a [[government]]al actor must provide a '''strong basis in evidence''' for its conclusion that [[remedial action]] is necessary.

The application of this rule has produced conflicting results.&lt;ref&gt;See Patricia L. Donze, Comment, The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] Denial of [[Certiorari]] in Dallas Firefighters Leaves Unsettled the Standard for Compelling Remedial Interests, 50 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 759, 779 (2000) (finding that some circuits require clear proof of the casual connection between past discrimination and present effects to satisfy the strong basis in evidence requirement, whereas other circuits let an inference suffice).&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, ''Croson'' did not offer guidance as to what amount and type of factual showing would provide a strong basis in evidence that [[discrimination]] existed in a particular industry.&lt;ref&gt;See Derek M. Alphran, Articles, Proving Discrimination After ''Croson'' and ''Adarand'': "If it Walks Like a Duck", 37 U.S.F. L. Rev. 887, 892-93 (2003) at 902 (noting that Croson did not produce a clear framework for courts to follow in deciding "whether a governmental actor has made a sufficient showing regarding the discriminatory effects alleged to exist or have existed in the public or private workplace in question").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justifying affirmative action by a government entity==
In order to uphold an [[affirmative action]] program under [[strict scrutiny]], there must exist a "strong basis in evidence" of past discrimination by the specific entity to support the conclusion that remedial action is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;See ''City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.'', 488 U.S. 469, 500 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; A generalized assertion that there has been past discrimination in an entire industry will not be enough to justify a program under strict scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;See ''id.'' at 498.&lt;/ref&gt; The government must have actively discriminated in its award of [[contract]]s or [[employment]] or have been a passive participant in a system of [[racial discrimination|racial exclusion]] practiced by elements of a local industry.

The most [[Relevance (law)|probative]] type of [[evidence]] seems to be statistical data showing "gross [[statistics|statistical]] disparities between the proportion of [[minority group|minorities]] hired... and the proportion of minorities willing and able to do the work."&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering Contractors Ass'n v. Metropolitan Dade County'', 122 F.3d 895, 907 (11th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1186 (1998) (quoting ''Ensley Branch, NAACP v. Seibels'', 31 F.3d 1548, 1565 (11th Cir. 1994)); see also ''Contractors Ass'n v. City of Phila.'', 6 F.3d 990, 1004 (3d Cir. 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[government contract]]ing cases, this is often shown through the use of a disparity index, which is a comparison between the share of contracts awarded to minority contractors and the percentage of qualified [[minority-owned]] firms in the local population that do such work.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Contractors Ass'n'', ''supra'', 1005.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, while the combination of "convincing anecdotal and statistical evidence is potent,"&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 1003 (quoting ''Coral Constr. Co. v. King County'', 941 F.2d 910, 919 (9th Cir. 1991)).&lt;/ref&gt; [[anecdotal evidence]], by itself, will rarely suffice to justify an affirmative action program evaluated under strict scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;For example, while the Third Circuit allows that "anecdotal evidence alone may, in an exceptional case, be so dominant or pervasive that it passes muster under ''Croson''," ''Contractors Ass'n'', ''supra'', at 1003, the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals|Ninth Circuit]] indicates that "anecdotal evidence... rarely, if ever, can... show a systemic pattern of discrimination necessary for the adoption of an affirmative action plan," ''Coral Constr.'', 941 F.2d at 919, and the Eleventh Circuit says that "only in the rare case will anecdotal evidence suffice standing alone." ''Engineering Contractors'', 122 F.3d at 925. See also ''Concrete Works, Inc. v. City &amp; County of Denver'', 36 F.3d 1513, 1521 (10th Cir. 1994) ("We deem anecdotal evidence...appropriate supplementary evidence in our strict scrutiny calculus.") (emphasis added). These statements also seem consistent with O'Connor's plurality in ''Croson'', which noted that "evidence of a pattern of individual discriminatory acts can, if supported by appropriate statistical proof, lend support to a local government's determination that broader remedial relief is justified." ''Croson'', ''supra'', at 509 (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Supreme Court of Hong Kong''' ({{zh|t=香港最高法院}}) was the highest court in [[Hong Kong]] prior to the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty]] of Hong Kong from the [[United Kingdom]] to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1997 and heard cases of first instance and appeals from the District and Magisrates Courts as well as certain tribunals. The Supreme Court was made up of the High Court of Justice (High Court) and the Court of Appeal.

On 1 July 1997, the Supreme Court became the [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]] which is made up of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal.

==History==
The Supreme Court was established in 1844 after Hong Kong became a British [[Crown colony]] under the [[Treaty of Nanjing]].  The first sitting of the court was on 1 October 1844 presided over by the first Chief Justice, [[John Walter Hulme]].

For almost 70 years after establishment of the court, there was no Court of Appeal in Hong Kong.   Appeals were either by way or re-hearing or direct to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. From 1913, appeals were heard by a Full Court made up of 3 judges. From 1913 to 1943, a judge of the [[British Supreme Court for China and Japan|British Supreme Court for China]] in Shanghai was eligible to sit on the Full Court. In the 1910s and 1920s, a Shanghai judge would regularly travel to Hong Kong to sit on the Full Court.  Sir [[Havilland de Sausmarez]], a judge of the Shanghai court, was the President of the Full Court from 1910 to 1920. From 1926 to 1941, a judge of the Hong Kong Supreme Court also sat on the full court of the [[British Supreme Court for China and Japan|British Supreme Court for China]].

The Court of Appeal was established in 1976.  Appeals from the Court of Appeal and Full Court and, certain criminal appeals from the High Court, lay to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in the United Kingdom.  In order to appeal to the Privy Council, leave to appeal was required either from the court appealed from or the Privy Council.

After the transfer of sovereignty the Supreme Court was renamed as the [[High Court of Hong Kong|High Court]] and the High Court of the former Supreme Court was renamed the Court of First Instance. Appeals from the Court of Appeal (and where there is such a direct appeal, the Court of First Instance) are now heard by the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]] which was established on 1 July 1997.

The interest income is exempt from [[federal income tax]] for the recipient—a treatment similar to that for interest income from [[municipal bonds]]. Tax anticipation notes are short term notes, issued at a discount, with a maturity period usually less than a year or a stated future date. Tax anticipation notes are used by municipalities to bridge funding gaps.

In the U.S. state of [[California]], Revenue Anticipation Notes (RANS) are issued and paid back within a [[fiscal year]], while Revenue Anticipation Warrants (RAWS) are issued on a fiscal year and paid back the following fiscal year.&lt;ref name="dukeistheremitchell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Daniel J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4065">{{About|the method of movie copying|information on the device|Telecine}}

The term '''telecine''' refers both to a [[Telecine|film-to-tape transferring machine]], as well as the process by which film is transferred to tape (or directly to a digital file).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/terms/telecine.cfm |title=AfterDawn.com Glossary - Telecine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telecine process is frequently used by filmmakers to transfer production footage to video, which can then be captured by various non-linear digital editing systems (e.g., [[Final Cut Pro]], Avid, etc.).

== Piracy ==
The term may also refer to a form of copying of movies (normally [[Copyright infringement|without authorization]] from the copyright holder) created using a [[telecine]] machine, as opposed to [[Cam (bootleg)|recording the projected image with a video camera]] (the camera method with a direct audio source is called a [[telesync|tele''sync'']]). Since this process requires both access to a print of the movie on film and expensive equipment, telecine bootlegs are less common than camera bootlegs.&lt;ref name="cg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projectspace.adc.rmit.edu.au/2006/comm2320/digifilm/Forms%20of%20Piracy.htm|title=What are the different types of Piracy?|author=Christopher George|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301104217/http://projectspace.adc.rmit.edu.au/2006/comm2320/digifilm/Forms%20of%20Piracy.htm|archivedate=2012-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Craig2005&gt;{{cite book |last1=Craig |first1=Paul |last2=Honick |first2=Ron |editor-first=Mark |editor-last=Burnett |title=Software Piracy Exposed - Secrets from the Dark Side Revealed |date=April 2005 |publisher= Syngress Publishing |location=United States of America |isbn=1-932266-98-4 |doi=10.1016/B978-193226698-6/50033-7 |pages=165–166 |chapter=Chapter 8: The Piracy Scene |quote=A telecine is the result of capturing each frame of footage directly from the film reel. This is achieved by projecting each frame of the film onto a charge coupled device (CCD). CCDs capture and record the projected video, giving Telecines a substantial increase in picture quality over both [[telesync]] and [[Cam (bootleg)|CAM]]. Although telecines are essentially an analog film capture, the film quality is close to that of a DVD. If a pirate has the technology and the time to produce a telecine, chances are it will pass as a DVD copy on the black market. Telecine audio comes directly from the mixing desk, which makes the telecine version of a film hard to distinguish from the real DVD. However, creating a telecine can take days of work. CCDs operate slowly, and a standard movie will take six to seven hours to capture. After capturing the video, the sound must be included and synced with each frame of video. Because they must be re-mastered, cleaned up, and packed, the full process of creating a telecine can take three to four days. |laysummary=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/705731/description}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also often seen used as in the naming of bootleg movie releases.&lt;ref name="VCDQuality"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vcdq.com/index.php?page=faq#3 |title=VCDQuality: Terms}} Lists recent video releases in the [[warez scene]].&lt;/ref&gt; A naming scheme would look something like this: Movie.title.year-of-production.TELECINE.[[Codec]]-[[List of warez groups#Movie groups|Groupname]]. Alternatively some groups simply use the TC tag instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orlydb.com/?q=.TC.+xvid|title=OlryDB.com}} [[Nuke_(warez)#Pre_database|Predb]] showing the usage of the TC tag in the [[Warez scene|scene]].&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of a good telecine is generally comparable to a DVD without any post-processing.&lt;ref name="cg" /&gt; This has motivated movie studios to develop countermeasures, such as [[Coded Anti-Piracy]] (CAP) to track the source of telecine copies in the hope of identifying the person responsible for the copy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2404">'''Tonnage and Poundage''' were certain duties and taxes first levied in [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]'s reign on every tun (cask) of imported [[wine]], which came mostly from [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], and on every pound weight of [[merchandise]] exported or imported.  Traditionally tonnage and poundage was granted by [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] to the king for life until the reign of  [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].  Tonnage and poundage were swept away by the Customs Consolidation Act of 1787.

==History==
[[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s first Parliament, known as the [[Useless Parliament]], broke with tradition and granted the king tonnage and poundage for a year rather than life out of concern over the manner in which tonnage and poundage's life grant of 1604 had been used by James to justify impositions, which were additional duties imposed on certain items. This restriction was seen as a provocative step by Parliament as it was one of the King's main sources of revenue, and Parliament intended the one-year limit to curb Charles' autonomy by forcing him to request money from Parliament every year thereafter.  Although Parliament passed this bill, [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] led a successful effort in the [[House of Lords]] to block it.  As a result, Parliament granted Charles no tonnage and poundage rights at all, which, combined with Parliament's efforts to impeach the Duke of Buckingham, led to Charles' first Parliament being dissolved.

Charles, however, continued to collect unauthorised tonnage and poundage duties, and this action became a chief complaint of Charles' failed Parliament of 1629.  When Charles moved to adjourn the Parliament, members held the speaker, [[John Finch, 1st Baron Finch|John Finch]], in his seat until three resolutions could be read, one of which declared anyone who paid unauthorised tonnage and poundage to be a betrayer and enemy of England.

==Impact==
Charles I's levying of tonnage and poundage without parliamentary sanction continued to be one of the complaints of his [[Long Parliament]].  The refusal of and subsequent disputes about tonnage and poundage rights is seen as one of the many events bearing responsibility for the [[English Civil War]].

The '''Universal Declaration of the Rights of Peoples''' was first drafted and elaborated during three round-table conferences that were organized by the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] (UNPO) [[Tartu]] Coordination Office on 29–30 August 1998; 31 October&amp;nbsp;– 1 November 1998, and 16–17 April 1999 in Tartu and [[Otepää]], [[Estonia]].

More than forty people participated in the discussions and hundreds of formulations of statements were considered. As a result, the draft of the document was adopted simultaneously in three languages ([[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]) at the last session on 17 April 1999 in Tartu.

This document is not to be confused with the [[Universal Declaration on the Rights of Peoples]] adopted in [[Algiers]], 4 July 1976.

The '''Wagoner Doctrine''' is an American 2nd Circuit legal principle applying the longstanding common law ''[[in pari delicto]]'' (roughly translated "in equal fault") rule in the bankruptcy setting.

Though controversial due to its willingness to bar recovery in what is typically considered an equitable proceeding (i.e. [[bankruptcy]]) and thus not well accepted in other circuits, Wagoner holds that "a claim against a third party for defrauding a corporation with the cooperation of corporate management accrues to the creditors, and not to the guilty corporation."

See ''[[in pari delicto]]'' for more information.
