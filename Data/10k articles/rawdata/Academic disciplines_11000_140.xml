'''Ace Centre''' (previously  '''ACE Centre''' (Aiding Communication in Education), ACE Centre North) provides support for people with complex communications difficulties. Ace Centre offer assessment, training and information services across England, with a focus on Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) and Assistive Technology (AT). AThe ACE Centre have two offices are based in [[Oldham]] and Abingdon, and provide assessment services to [[England and Wales]] and are non-profit making independent organisation with charitable status.

== Brief outline ==
Ace Centre is a registered charity (No. 1089313) providing support for people with complex communications difficulties. 

== Foundation ==

The first ACE Centre was started in 1984 through UK government funding as part of the new initiative to introduce information technology into schools in England and Wales following the end of the Micro-Electronics Project MEP.  During MEP four [[Special education|Special Education]] Micro-technology Resource Centres (SEMERCs) were set up in London (Redbridge), Manchester, Bristol and Newcastle. A special education [[Software engineering|software development]] centre was also established in Manchester.  It was felt that those pupils with severe language or physical disabilities required more specialist support.

This idea for the first ACE centre to support these students came from Tim Southgate (Head of Ormerod Special School) and Prue Fuller, a teacher at the school. They were inspired by the computer research of Patrick Poon at the school. The original staff at the opening of the Centre in May 1984 were Prue Fuller (Director), Andrew Lysley (SEN Teacher), David Colven (Technical Officer) and Pauline Paine (Administrator).  The Centre was managed by Mary Hope at MESU, a post that was later taken over by Tina Detheridge now of Wigit Software.

It was essentially a project under the management of MESU (Micro Electronics Support Unit) a government quango which later merged with CET (Centre for [[Educational technology|Educational Technology]]) to become NCET (the National Centre for Educational Technology). This eventually became Becta (British Educational Communications and Technology Agency) in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;ACE Centre: [http://www.ace-centre.org.uk/index.cfm?pageid=12D0CFAF-3048-7290-FE61D857018897C3 History of the ACE Centre]. (Source for part of the "Founcation" section.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 a second Centre was opened in [[Oldham]]  at Park Dean School It was managed by the head teacher Rhys Williams, who later became principal of Hereward College, and Roger Bates (now of Inclusive Technology).  The first Director proper of ACE Oldham as it was then was Steve Broadbent.  The two Centres in Oldham and Oxford service the north and south of England and Wales respectively.

== History ==

'''Location'''
The ACE Center was housed in a spare classroom at Ormerod special school in [[Headington|Headington, Oxford]] .  Later it moved to temporary buildings on the same site and remained there until the new 'Wooden Spoon' building was erected on [[Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre]] site in 1998.  The new 'Wooden Spoon' building was largely funded by the Wooden Spoon Society&lt;ref&gt;Wooden Spoon: [http://www.woodenspoon.com/projects/project_history.php?sortd=wspoon_commitment&amp;includeref=dynamic Project History].&lt;/ref&gt; and was officially opened by [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] in April 1999. The new building has custom build facilities for assessment and training.

'''Staff'''
It has occupational therapists, speech and language Therapists, special needs and mainstream teachers, assistive technology specialists and support staff.  Early members of staff were Caroline Gray ([[occupational therapist]]), Gillian Hazell (the Nelms, Speech and Language Therapist) and Mark Saville (web page and publications creator).

Prue Fuller retired as director in 1999 and was later awarded an MBE for her services to Assistive and Alternative Communication.  She was also bi-annual president of ISAAC 1998 - 2000.  Caroline Grey became director of the ACE Centre following Prue's retirement until she retired in 2007.  Liz Tapper took over as temporary director until September 2008 and Dr Ben Janubi has been in post since January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;ACE Centre: [http://www.ace-centre.org.uk/index.cfm?pageid=CC3AA672-3048-7290-FE03DC64593E3CD8 Staff Profiles] (incomplete source).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The CAP Project''' This was a government initiative to boost the support and provision of communication aids to school students.&lt;ref&gt;Teach Training Resource Bank: [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100605151523/http://www.ttrb.ac.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?anchorId=17790&amp;selectedId=18229&amp;menu=17837&amp;ContentId=13930 Evaluation of the Communication Aids Project].&lt;/ref&gt;  The ACE Centres were two of the organisations involved with assessment for this project.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  It initially had a two-year timetable and a £10M budget but was extended for a further two years on the same funding basis. During this time the staffing in the centre increased considerably to cope with the assessment demand.

== Software developments ==
The first software developments at the ace centre was to re-write Sentence Scan and Start-Write for the increasingly popular [[BBC Micro]].  Sentence scan was a switch or keyboard accessible sentence builder with speech support.  Sentences could be built up from sets of stored words or phrases.  Start-Write was a letter/keyboard based program with speech support and sophisticated user support configurations.  Staff from the Centre also contributed to the design of the programs such as 'Prompt Writer' and 'Concept', being created by the Special Needs Software Centre based at the Manchester SEMERC managed by Dave King.

The advent of the [[IBM PC compatible|IBM compatible]] computer lead to more graphics based programs being developed for switch users such as 'Plocka' (Swedish for 'pick up').  Plocka has facilities for creating sorting and matching scenarios for switch users and has a built in [[graphics library]].

* AccessMaths is a program developed for students that need to create geometric drawings but cannot manipulate a mouse. Users can use a laptop keyboard only to produce accurate and detailed mathematical constructions and drawings. Switch users can also manipulate the program via programs like 'The Grid 2' and 'SAW' (see below). It was originally developed on the BBC Master computer but later versions were created for use in [[Microsoft Windows|Windows 3]] and later.  The current version is version 4 which is available in English, Swedish and French.  Number Navigator is also a maths based utility which enables students to do 'sums' within a formatted grid.
* SAW (Special Access to Windows) is a program that was created from a grant from the then [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] to enable switch users to manipulate mathematical equations on screen.  It was quickly realised that creating a programmable scanning on-screen keyboard for Windows (version 3 at the time,) the full functionality of what they were hoping to create - and much more - could be realised by using other programs such as 'MathType'.  These programmable on-screen keyboards (selection sets) are now available for a number of very different applications.  SAw 5 is now an [[Open-source software|open source]] program available from the [[OATS|Oatsoft web site]].
* Hotspots - This program has similar user characteristics to SAW, but is designed for [[Point-and-click|point and click]] environments.  In addition to scanning user defined spots on the screen it can annotate these with sounds, images and text.  It is easy to make simple software switch accessible.

== Publications ==
The Ace Centre has published a number of reviews, guides, and 'how to' documents over the years. as well as contributing articles to conferences and [[peer review]]ed journals.  The main forum for disseminating out work is increasingly through the web site but they regularly give papers at conferences including the ISAAC conference,  Communication Matters, AAATE and others.

== Research and projects ==
Ace Centre works with companies, universities and other charities to:
* Investigate health and education issues for children and adults with complex disabilities
* Support companies to trial new products and develop progressive technology
* Find solutions for an individual or a sector
Research and development projects enhance achievement and good practice in the field; directly, through the development of AT &amp;  AAC, and indirectly through awareness raising, skills building and informing government policy. Service-users with communication disabilities are involved throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://acecentre.org.uk/services/research/|title=Research {{!}} Ace Centre|work=Ace Centre|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AYNI Social Lab''' is the social innovation laboratory of the [[Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion of Peru]]. It was created in October 2016 to promote the generation of cost-effective [[innovations]] for [[social policy]], through the identification and implementation of innovative solutions aimed at improving the quality of life of the population in conditions of [[poverty]] or [[vulnerability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In addition to the specialists and the technical team of the AYNI Lab Social, the "Working Group" is the one which has the responsibility of guiding all its activities. This group is made up of: the Deputy Minister of Social Policy and Evaluation (President of the team), the Deputy Minister of Social Benefits, the Director General of Quality Management of Social Programs, the Director General of Articulation or Coordination of Social Benefits, the Director General of Monitoring and Evaluation, the Director of Evaluation, and the Head of the Planning and Investment Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The AYNI Lab Social seeks to facilitate the development of social innovations that are original, transferable and reproducible, capable of being transformed into policies, cost-effective, and scalable.{{fact|date=September 2017}} In this context, the development of both institutional and technological innovations are being addressed. A good deal of institutional innovations make use of insights from [[behavioral economics]] and [[psychology]] to achieve cost-effective mechanisms and solutions;{{fact|date=September 2017}}  moreover, all these seek to be evaluated using experimental methodologies and [[impact evaluation]]. As for the technological innovations, these have been addressed on the basis of the open calls "Competitions of Social Innovations", promoted jointly with the [[Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion of Peru]], the [[Ministry of Production of Peru]] and [[Innóvate Perú]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3937">[[File:Sound-transmission.png|300px|thumb|Example of airborne and structure-borne transmission of sound, where Lp is sound pressure level, A is attenuation, P is acoustical pressure, S is the area of the wall [m²], and τ is the transmission coefficient]]
'''Acoustic transmission''' is the transmission of sounds through and between materials, including air, wall, and musical instruments.

The degree to which sound is transferred between two materials depends on how well their [[acoustical impedance]]s match. 

==In musical instrument design==
[[Musical instrument]]s are generally designed to radiate sound effectively. A high-impedance part of the instrument, such as a string, transmits vibrations through a bridge (intermediate impedance) to a sound board (lower impedance). The soundboard then moves the still lower-impedance air. Without bridge and soundboard, the instrument does not transmit enough sound to the air, and is too quiet to be performed with. An electric guitar has no soundboard; it uses a microphone pick-up and artificial amplification. Without amplification, electric guitars are very quiet.

==Stethoscope==
[[Stethoscope]]s roughly match the acoustical impedance of the human body, so they transmit sounds from a patient's chest to the doctor's ear much more effectively than the air does. Putting an ear to someone's chest would have a similar effect.

==In building design==
Acoustic transmission in building design refers to a number of processes by which sound can be transferred from one part of a building to another. Typically these are:
#Airborne transmission - a noise source in one room sends air pressure waves which induce vibration to one side of a wall or element of structure setting it moving such that the other face of the wall vibrates in an adjacent room. [[Structural isolation]] therefore becomes an important consideration in the [[Soundproofing|acoustic design]] of buildings. Highly sensitive areas of buildings, for example recording studios, may be almost entirely isolated from the rest of a structure by constructing the studios as effective boxes supported by springs. Air tightness also becomes an important control technique. A tightly sealed door might have reasonable sound reduction properties, but if it is left open only a few millimeters its effectiveness is reduced to practically nothing. The most important acoustic control method is adding mass into the structure, such as a heavy dividing wall, which will usually reduce airborne sound transmission better than a light one.
#Impact transmission - a noise source in one room results from an impact of an object onto a separating surface, such as a floor and transmits the sound to an adjacent room. A typical example would be the sound of footsteps in a room being heard in a room below. Acoustic control measures usually include attempts to isolate the source of the impact, or cushioning it. For example carpets will perform significantly better than hard floors.
#Flanking transmission - a more complex form of noise transmission, where the resultant vibrations from a noise source are transmitted to other rooms of the building usually by elements of structure within the building. For example, in a steel framed building, once the frame itself is set into motion the effective transmission can be pronounced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8256">An '''allele-specific oligonucleotide''' ('''ASO''') is a short piece of synthetic [[DNA]] complementary to the sequence of a variable target DNA. It acts as a [[Hybridization probe|probe]] for the presence of the target in a [[Southern blot]] assay or, more commonly, in the simpler [[Dot blot]] assay. It is a common tool used in [[genetic testing]], [[forensics]], and [[Molecular Biology]] research.

An ASO is typically an [[oligonucleotide]] of 15–21 [[nucleotide|nucleotide bases]] in length. It is designed (and used) in a way that makes it specific for only one version, or [[allele]], of the DNA being tested. The length of the ASO, which strand it is chosen from, and the conditions by which it is [[Nucleic acid hybridization|bound to]] (and washed from) the target DNA all play a role in its specificity. These probes can usually be designed to detect a difference of as little as 1 base in the target's genetic sequence, a basic ability in the assay of [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs), important in [[genotype|genotype analysis]] and the [[Human Genome Project]]. To be detected after it has bound to its target, the ASO must be labeled with a radioactive, enzymatic, or fluorescent tag. The [[Illumina Methylation Assay]] technology takes advantage of ASO to detect one base pair difference (cytosine versus thymine) to measure methylation at a specific CpG site.

==Example==
[[File:Allele-specific oligonucleotide (sample).jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Binding of the "S" ASO probe to "S" DNA (top) or "A" DNA (bottom).&lt;/center&gt;]]
The human disease [[sickle-cell disease|sickle cell anemia]] is caused by a genetic [[mutation]] in the [[codon]] for the sixth [[amino acid]] of the blood protein [[HBB|beta-hemoglobin]]. The normal DNA sequence G-A-G codes for the amino acid [[glutamate]], while the mutation changes the middle [[adenine]] to a [[thymine]], leading to the sequence G-T-G (G-U-G in the [[messenger RNA|mRNA]]). This altered sequence substitutes a [[valine]] into the final protein, distorting its structure.

To test for the presence of the mutation in a DNA sample, an ASO probe would be synthesized to be complementary to the altered sequence,&lt;ref name="Studencki"&gt;Studencki AB, Conner BJ, Impraim CC, Teplitz RL, and Wallace RB "Discrimination among the human beta A, beta S, and beta C-globin genes using allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization probes." Am J Hum Genet vol. 37(1), pp. 42–51 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; here labeled as "S". As a control, another ASO would be synthesized for the normal sequence "A". Each ASO is fully complementary to its target sequence (and will bind strongly), but has a single mismatch against its non-target allele (leading to weaker interaction). The first diagram shows how the "S" probe is fully complementary to the "S" target (top), but is partially mismatched against the "A" target (bottom).

[[image:DotBlotDemo.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Schematic of dot-blots using the "A" or "S" ASO probes.&lt;/center&gt;]]
A segment of the beta-hemoglobin genes in the sample DNA(s) would be amplified by PCR, and the resulting products applied to duplicate support membranes as [[Dot blot]]s. The sample's DNA strands are separated with alkali, and each ASO probe is applied to a different blot. After hybridization, a washing protocol is used which can discriminate between the fully complementary and the mismatched hybrids. The mismatched ASOs are washed off of the blots, while the matched ASOs (and their labels) remain.

In the second diagram, six samples of amplified DNA have been applied to each of the two blots. [[Autoradiography|Detection]] of the ASO label that remains after washing allows a direct reading of the [[genotype]] of the samples, each with two copies of the beta-hemoglobin gene. Samples 1 and 4 only have the normal "A" allele, while samples 3 and 5 have both the "A" and "S" alleles (and are therefore [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|heterozygous]] [[Genetic carrier|carriers]] of this [[Dominance relationship#Recessive allele|recessive mutation]]). Samples 2 and 6 have only the "S" allele, and would be affected by the disease. The small amount of 'cross hybridization' shown is typical, and is considered in the process of interpreting the final results.

==Alternatives==
ASO analysis is only one of the methods used to detect genetic polymorphisms. Direct [[DNA sequencing]] is used to initially characterize the mutation, but is too laborious for routine screening. An earlier method, [[Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism]] (RFLP) didn't need to know the sequence change beforehand, but required that the mutation affect the cleavage site of a [[Restriction Enzyme]]. The RFLP assay was briefly adapted to the use of oligonucleotide [[Oligomer restriction|probes]],&lt;ref name="Saiki1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/ebind2html/pcr/034 |title=Enzymatic amplification of beta-globin genomic sequences and restriction site analysis for diagnosis of sickle cell anemia |last=Saiki |first=RK |author2=Scharf S |author3=Faloona F |author4=Mullis KB |author5=Horn GT |author6=Erlich HA |author7=Arnheim N |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=20 Dec 1985 |volume=230 |issue=4732 |pages=1350–4 |doi=10.1126/science.2999980 |pmid=2999980 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this technique was quickly supplanted by ASO analysis of [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) amplified DNA. The PCR technique itself has been adapted to detect polymorphisms, as [[Variants of PCR|allele-specific PCR]]. However, the simplicity and versatility of the combined PCR/ASO method has led to its continued use, including with non-radioactive labels, and in a "reverse dot blot" format where the ASO probes are bound to the membrane and the amplified sample DNA is used for [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]].

==History==
The use of synthetic oligonucleotides as specific probes for genetic sequence variations was pioneered by R. Bruce Wallace, working at the [[City of Hope National Medical Center]] in [[Duarte, California]]. In 1979 Wallace and his coworkers reported the use of ASO probes to detect variations in a single-stranded bacterial virus,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace RB, Shaffer J, Murphy RF, Bonner J, Hirose T, and Itakura K "Hybridization of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides to Phi-X 174 DNA: the effect of single base pair mismatch." Nucleic Acids Research, vol. 6(11), pp. 3543–3558 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and later applied the technique to cloned human genes. In 1983&lt;ref&gt;Conner BJ, Reyes AA, Morin C, Itakura K, Teplitz RL, and Wallace RB "Detection of sickle cell beta S-globin allele by hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotides." Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. vol. 80(1), pp. 278–282 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; and 1985&lt;ref name="Studencki"/&gt; Wallace's lab reported the detection of the mutation for [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cell anemia]] in samples of whole genomic DNA, although this application was hampered by the small amount of label that could be carried by the ASO.&lt;ref name="Studencki"/&gt;

Fortunately PCR, a method to greatly amplify a specific segment of DNA, was also reported in 1985.&lt;ref name="Saiki1"/&gt; In less than a year PCR had been paired with ASO analysis.&lt;ref name="Saiki2"&gt;Saiki RK, Bugawan TL, Horn GT, Mullis KB, and Erlich HE "Analysis of enzymatically amplified beta-globin and HLA-DQ DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes" Nature vol. 324(6093) pp. 163–166 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; This combination solved the problem of ASO labeling, since the amount of target DNA could be amplified over a million-fold. Also, the specificity of the PCR process itself could be added to that of the ASO probes, greatly reducing the problem of spurious binding of the ASO to non-target sequences. The combination was specific enough that it could be used in a simple [[Dot blot]], avoiding the laborious and inefficient [[Southern blot]] method.

'''Applied ontology''' involves the practical application of [[ontological]] resources to specific domains, such as [[management]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], [[biomedicine]] or [[geography]]. Much work in applied ontology is carried out within the framework of the [[semantic web]].

==Applying ontology to relationships==
The challenge of applying ontology is ontology's emphasis on a [[world view]] [[orthogonal]] to [[epistemology]].  The emphasis is on being rather than on doing (as implied by "[[applied science|applied]]") or on [[knowledge|knowing]].  This is explored by philosophers and pragmatists like [[Fernando Flores]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].

One way in which that emphasis plays out is in the concept of "[[speech acts]]": acts of promising, ordering, apologizing, requesting, inviting or sharing.  The study of these acts from an ontological perspective is one of the driving forces behind relationship-oriented applied ontology.&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote = Talk all you want to, Flores says, but if you want to act powerfully, you need to master 'speech acts': language rituals that build trust between colleagues and customers, word practices that open your eyes to new possibilities. Speech acts are powerful because most of the actions that people engage in -- in business, in marriage, in parenting -- are carried out through conversation.
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This can involve concepts championed by [[Ordinary-language philosophy|ordinary language]] philosophers like [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

Applying ontology can also involve looking at the relationship between a person's world and that person's actions.  The context or [[Heideggerian terminology#Clearing|clearing]] is highly influenced by the being of the subject or the field of [[Category of being|being]] itself.  This view is highly influenced by the philosophy of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/ |title=Phenomenology |date=2013-12-16 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the works of Heidegger, and others.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32182">{{Automation}}
'''Automation bias''' is the propensity for humans to favor suggestions from automated [[decision support system|decision-making systems]] and to ignore contradictory information made without automation, even if it is correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.2514/6.2004-6313 |chapter=Automation Bias in Intelligent Time Critical Decision Support Systems |title=AIAA 1st Intelligent Systems Technical Conference |year=2004 |last1=Cummings |first1=Mary |isbn=978-1-62410-080-2 |chapter-url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20141101113133/http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/labs/halab/papers/CummingsAIAAbias.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101113133/http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/labs/halab/papers/CummingsAIAAbias.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-01 |df= |url=http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/labs/halab/papers/CummingsAIAAbias.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Automation bias stems from the social psychology literature that found a bias in human-human interaction that people believe assign more positive evaluations to decisions made by humans than to a neutral object.&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, J. S., &amp; Tagiuri, R. (1954). The perception of people. HARVARD UNIV CAMBRIDGE MA LAB OF SOCIAL RELATIONS.&lt;/ref&gt; The same type of positivity bias has been found for human-automation interaction, where the automated decisions are rated more positively than neutral.&lt;ref&gt;Dzindolet, M. T., Peterson, S. A., Pomranky, R. A., Pierce, L. G., &amp; Beck, H. P. (2003). The role of trust in automation reliance. International journal of human-computer studies, 58(6), 697-718.&lt;/ref&gt; This has become a growing problem for decision making as [[intensive care units]], [[nuclear power plants]], and aircraft [[cockpit]]s have increasingly involved computerized system monitors and decision aids. Errors of automation bias tend to occur when decision-making is dependent on computers or other automated aids and the human is in an observatory role. Examples of automation bias range from urgent matters like flying a plane on automatic pilot to such mundane matters as the use of [[spell-checking]] programs.&lt;ref name="University of Illinois at Chicago"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Skitka|first1=Linda|title=Automation|url=https://lskitka.people.uic.edu/styled-7/styled-14/index.html|website=University of Illinois|publisher=University of Illinois at Chicago|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disuse and Misuse==

An operator's trust in the system can also lead to different interactions with the system, including system use, misuse, disuse, and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parasuraman|first1=Raja|last2=Riley|first2=V|title=Humans and automation: Use, misuse, disuse, abuse.|journal=Human factors|date=1997|volume=39|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tendency toward overreliance on automated aids is known as "automation misuse".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Parasuraman, R., &amp; Riley, V. (1997). Humans and automation: Use, misuse, disuse, abuse. Human factors, 39(2), 230-253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="international Journal of Aviation Psychology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mosier|first1=Kathleen|last2=Skitka|first2=Linda|last3=Heers|first3=Susan|last4=Burdick|first4=Mark|title=Automation Bias: Decision Making and Performance in High-Tech Cockpits|journal=International Journal of Aviation Psychology|date=February 1997|volume=8|issue=1|pages=47–63|doi=10.1207/s15327108ijap0801_3|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11805395_Automation_Bias_Decision_Making_and_Performance_in_High-Tech_Cockpits|accessdate=17 January 2017|pmid=11540946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misuse of automation can be seen when a user fails to properly monitor an automated system, or when the automated system is used when it should not be. This is in contrast to disuse, where the user does not properly utilize the automation either by turning it off or ignoring it. Both misuse and disuse can be problematic, but automation bias is directly related to misuse of the automation through either too much trust in the abilities of the system, or defaulting to using heuristics. Misuse can lead to lack of monitoring of the automated system or blind agreement with an automation suggestion, categorized by two types of errors, errors of omission and errors of commission, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tversky, A., &amp; Kahneman, D. (1974). Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases. science, 185(4157), 1124-1131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Automation use and disuse can also influence stages of information processing: information acquisition, information analysis, decision making and action selection, and action implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wickens|last2=Hollands|last3=Banbury|last4=Parasuraman|title=Engineering psychology &amp; human performance.|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, information acquisition, the first step in information processing, is the process by which a user registers input via the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wickens|first1=Christopher|last2=Hollands|first2=Justin|last3=Banbury|first3=Simon|last4=Parasuraman|first4=Raja|title=Engineering Psychology and Human Performance|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An automated engine gauge might assist the user with information acquisition through simple interface features—such as highlighting changes in the engine's performance—thereby directing the user's selective attention. When faced with issues originating from an aircraft, pilots may tend to overtrust an aircraft's engine gauges, losing sight of other possible malfunctions not related to the engine. This attitude is a form of automation complacency and misuse. If, however, the pilot devotes time to interpret the engine gauge, and manipulate the aircraft accordingly, only to discover that the flight turbulence has not changed, the pilot may be inclined to ignore future error recommendations conveyed by an engine gauge—a form of automation complacency leading to disuse.

== Errors of commission and omission ==
Automation bias can take the form of commission errors, which occur when users follow an automated directive without taking into account other sources of information. Conversely, omission errors occur when automated devices fail to detect or indicate problems and the user does not notice because they are not properly monitoring the system.&lt;ref name="Sagepub"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mosier|first1=Kathleen|last2=Dunbar|first2=Melisa|last3=McDonnell|first3=Lori|last4=Skitka|first4=Linda|last5=Burdick|first5=Mark|last6=Rosenblatt|first6=Bonnie|title=Automation Bias and Errors: Are Teams Better than Individuals?|journal=PROCEEDINGS of the HUMAN FACTORS AND ERGONOMICS SOCIETY|date=October 1, 1998|pages=201–205|url=http://pro.sagepub.com/content/42/3/201.abstract|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Errors of omission have been shown to result from cognitive vigilance decrements, while errors of commission result from a combination of a failure to take information into account and an excessive trust in the reliability of automated aids.&lt;ref name="University of Illinois at Chicago"/&gt; Errors of commission occur for three reasons: (1) overt redirection of attention away from the automated aid; (2) diminished attention to the aid; (3) active discounting of information that counters the aid's recommendations.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parasuraman|first1=Raja|last2=Manzey|first2=Dietrich|title=Complacency and Bias in Human Use of Automation: An Attentional Integration|journal=The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society|date=June 2010|volume=52|issue=3|pages=381–410|doi=10.1177/0018720810376055|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47792928_Complacency_and_Bias_in_Human_Use_of_Automation_An_Attentional_Integration|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omission errors occur when the human decision-maker fails to notice an automation failure, either due to low vigilance or overtrust in the system.&lt;ref name="University of Illinois at Chicago"/&gt; For example, a spell-checking program incorrectly marking a word as misspelled and suggesting an alternative would be an error of commission, and a spell-checking program failing to notice a misspelled word would be an error of omission. In these cases, automation bias could be observed by a user accepting the alternative word without consulting a dictionary, or a user not noticing the incorrectly misspelled word and assuming all the words are correct without reviewing the words.

Training that focused on the reduction of automation bias and related problems has been shown to lower the rate of commission errors, but not of omission errors.&lt;ref name="University of Illinois at Chicago"/&gt;

==Factors==
The presence of automatic aids, as one source puts it, "diminishes the likelihood that decision makers will either make the cognitive effort to seek other diagnostic information or process all available information in cognitively complex ways." It also renders users more likely to conclude their assessment of a situation too hastily after being prompted by an automatic aid to take a specific course of action.&lt;ref name="international Journal of Aviation Psychology"/&gt;

According to one source, there are three main factors that lead to automation bias. First, the human tendency to choose the least cognitive approach to decision-making, which is called the [[cognitive miser]] hypothesis. Second, the tendency of humans to view automated aids as having an analytical ability superior to their own. Third, the tendency of humans to reduce their own effort when sharing tasks, either with another person or with an automated aid.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

Other factors leading to an over-reliance on automation and thus to automation bias include inexperience in a task (though inexperienced users tend to be most benefited by automated decision support systems), lack of confidence in one's own abilities, a lack of readily available alternative information, or desire to save time and effort on complex tasks or high workloads.&lt;ref name=goddard2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goddard|first1=K.|last2=Roudsari|first2=A.|last3=Wyatt|first3=J. C.|title=Automation bias: a systematic review of frequency, effect mediators, and mitigators|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|date=2012|volume=19|issue=1|pages=121–127|doi=10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000089|pmid=21685142|pmc=3240751}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alberdi2009"&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-04468-7_3|chapter=Why Are People's Decisions Sometimes Worse with Computer Support?|title=Computer Safety, Reliability, and Security|volume=5775|pages=18–31|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2009|last1=Alberdi|first1=Eugenio|last2=Strigini|first2=Lorenzo|last3=Povyakalo|first3=Andrey A.|last4=Ayton|first4=Peter|isbn=978-3-642-04467-0|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goddard2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goddard|first1=Kate|last2=Roudsari|first2=Abdul|last3=Wyatt|first3=Jeremy C.|title=Automation bias: Empirical results assessing influencing factors|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|date=2014|volume=83|issue=5|pages=368–375|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.01.001|pmid=24581700}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It has been shown that people who have greater confidence in their own decision-making abilities tend to be less reliant on external automated support, while those with more trust in decision support systems (DSS) were more dependent upon it.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goddard|first1=Kate|last2=Roudsari|first2=Abdul|last3=Wyatt|first3=Jeremy|title=Automation bias: a systematic review of frequency, effect mediators, and mitigators|journal=J Am Med Inform Association|date=June 16, 2011|volume=19|issue=1|pages=121–127|doi=10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000089|pmc=3240751|pmid=21685142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screen design===
One study, published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association]]'', found that the position and prominence of advice on a screen can impact the likelihood of automation bias, with prominently displayed advice, correct or not, is more likely to be followed; another study, however, seemed to discount the importance of this factor.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt; According to another study, a greater amount of on-screen detail can make users less "conservative" and thus increase the likelihood of automation bias.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt; One study showed that making individuals accountable for their performance or the accuracy of their decisions reduced automation bias.&lt;ref name="University of Illinois at Chicago"/&gt;

===Availability===

"The availability of automated decision aids," states one study by [[Linda Skitka]], "can sometimes feed into the general human tendency to travel the road of least cognitive effort."&lt;ref name="University of Illinois at Chicago"/&gt;

===Awareness of process===

One study also found that when users are made aware of the reasoning process employed by a decision support system, they are likely to adjust their reliance accordingly, thus reducing automation bias.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt;

===Team vs. individual===
The performance of jobs by crews instead of individuals acting alone does not necessarily eliminate automation bias.&lt;ref name="The International Journal of Aviation Psychology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mosier|first1=Kathleen|last2=Skitka|first2=Linda|last3=Dunbar|first3=Melisa|last4=McDonnell|first4=Lori|title=Aircrews and Automation Bias: The Advantages of Teamwork?|journal=The International Journal of Aviation Psychology|date=November 13, 2009|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1–14|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/S15327108IJAP1101_1?needAccess=true&amp;|accessdate=17 January 2017|doi=10.1207/S15327108IJAP1101_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagepub"/&gt; One study has shown that when automated devices failed to detect system irregularities, teams were no more successful than solo performers at responding to those irregularities.&lt;ref name="University of Illinois at Chicago"/&gt;

===Training===
Training that focuses on automation bias in [[aviation]] has succeeded in reducing omission errors by student pilots.&lt;ref name="The International Journal of Aviation Psychology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagepub"/&gt;

===Automation failure and "learned carelessness"===
It has been shown that automation failure is followed by a drop in operator trust, which in turn is succeeded by a slow recovery of trust. The decline in trust after an initial automation failure has been described as the first-failure effect.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt; By the same token, if automated aids prove to be highly reliable over time, the result is likely to be a heightened level of automation bias. This is called "learned carelessness."&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

=== Provision of system confidence information ===
In cases where system confidence information is provided to users, that information itself can become a factor in automation bias.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

=== External pressures ===
Studies have shown that the more external pressures are exerted on an individual's cognitive capacity, the more he or she may rely on external support.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt;

===Definitional problems===
Although automation bias has been the subject of many studies, there continues to be complaints that it remains ill-defined and that reporting of incidents involving automation bias is unsystematic.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyell|first=David|last2=Coiera|first2=Enrico|date=August 2016|title=Automation bias and verification complexity: a systematic review|url=https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/24/2/423/2631492/Automation-bias-and-verification-complexity-a|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|volume=24|issue=2|pages=424–431|doi=10.1093/jamia/ocw105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of various automation bias studies categorized the different types of tasks where automated aids were used as well as what function the automated aids served. Tasks where automated aids were used were categorized as monitoring tasks, diagnosis tasks, or treatment tasks. Types of automated assistance were listed as Alerting automation, which track important changes and alert the user, Decision support automation, which may provide a diagnosis or recommendation, or Implementation automation, where the automated aid performs a specified task.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Generalizing the effects of automation bias may undermine the development of specific and effective solutions.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Automation-induced complacency==
The concept of automation bias is viewed as overlapping with automation-induced complacency, also known more simply as automation complacency. Like automation bias, it is a consequence of the misuse of automation and involves problems of attention. While automation bias involves a tendency to trust decision-support systems, automation complacency involves insufficient attention to and monitoring of automation output, usually because that output is viewed as reliable.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt; "Although the  concepts  of complacency  and automation bias have been discussed separately as if they were independent," writes one expert, "they share several commonalities, suggesting they reflect different aspects of the same  kind of automation misuse." It has been proposed, indeed, that the concepts of complacency and automation bias be combined into a single "integrative concept" because these two concepts "might represent different manifestations of overlapping automation-induced phenomena" and because "automation-induced complacency and automation bias represent closely linked theoretical concepts that show considerable overlap with respect to the underlying processes."&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

Automation complacency has been defined as "poorer detection of system malfunctions under automation compared with under manual control." [[NASA|NASA's]] [[Aviation Safety Reporting System]] (ASRS) defines complacency as "self-satisfaction that  may result in non-vigilance based on an unjustified assumption of satisfactory system state." Several studies have indicated that it occurs most often when operators are engaged in both manual and automated tasks at the same time. In turn, the operators' perceptions of the automated system's reliability can influence the way in which the operator interacts with the system. Endsley (2017) describes how high system reliability can lead users to disengage from monitoring systems, thereby increasing monitoring errors, decreasing situational awareness, and interfering with an operator's ability to re-assume control of the system in the event performance limitations have been exceeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Endsley|first1=Mica|title=From Here to Autonomy Lessons Learned From Human–Automation Research|journal=Human Factors|volume=59|issue=1|pages=5–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This complacency can be sharply reduced when automation reliability varies over time instead of remaining constant, but is not reduced by experience and practice. Both expert and inexpert participants can exhibit automation bias as well as automation complacency. Neither of these problems can be easily overcome by training.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

The term "automation complacency" was first used in connection with aviation accidents or incidents in which [[Aircraft pilot|pilots]], [[Air traffic controller|air-traffic controllers]], or  other workers failed to check systems sufficiently, assuming that everything was fine when, in reality, an accident was about to occur. Operator complacency, whether or not automation-related, has long been recognized as a leading factor in air accidents.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

As such, perceptions of reliability, in general, can result in a form of automation irony, in which more automation can decrease cognitive workload but increase the opportunity for monitoring errors. In contrast, low automation can increase workload but decrease the opportunity for monitoring errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bainbridge|first1=Lisanne|title=Ironies of automation|journal=Analysis, Design and Evaluation of Man–Machine Systems|date=1983|pages=129–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Take, for example, a pilot flying through inclement weather, in which continuous thunder interferes with the pilot's ability to understand information transmitted by an air traffic controller (ATC). Despite how much effort is allocated to understanding information transmitted by ATC, the pilot's performance is limited by the source of information needed for the task. The pilot therefore has to rely on automated gauges in the cockpit to understand flight path information. If the pilot perceives the automated gauges to be highly reliable, the amount of effort needed to understand ATC and automated gauges may decrease. Moreover, if the automated gauges are perceived to be highly reliable, the pilot may ignore those gauges to devote mental resources for deciphering information transmitted by ATC. In so doing, the pilot becomes a complacent monitor, thereby running the risk of missing critical information conveyed by the automated gauges. If, however, the pilot perceives the automated gauges to be unreliable, the pilot will now have to interpret information from ATC and automated gauges simultaneously. This creates scenarios in which the operator may be expending unnecessary cognitive resources when the automation is in fact reliable, but also increasing the odds of identifying potential errors in the weather gauges should they occur. To calibrate the pilot's perception of reliability, automation should be designed to maintain workload at appropriate levels while also ensuring the operator remains engaged with monitoring tasks. The operator should be less likely to disengage from monitoring when the system's reliability can change as compared to a system that has consistent reliability (Parasuraman, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parasuraman|first1=Raja|title=Performance Consequences of Automation Induced Complacency|journal=The International Journal of Aviation Psychology|date=1993|volume=1|issue=3|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To some degree, user complacency offsets the benefits of automation, and when an automated system's reliability level falls below a certain level, then automation will no longer be a net asset. One 2007 study suggested that this automation occurs when the reliability level reaches approximately 70%. Other studies have found that automation with a reliability level below 70% can be of use to persons with access to the raw information sources, which can be combined with the automation output to improve performance.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

==Sectors==
Automation bias has been examined across many research fields.&lt;ref name=goddard2012/&gt; It can be a particularly major concern in aviation, [[medicine]], [[process control]], and [[military]] [[command-and-control]] operations.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

===Aviation===
At first, discussion of automation bias focused largely on aviation. Automated aids have played an increasing role in cockpits, taking a growing role in the control of such flight tasks as determining the most fuel-efficient routes, navigating, and detecting and diagnosing system malfunctions. The use of these aids, however, can lead to less attentive and less vigilant information seeking and processing on the part of human beings. In some cases, human beings may place more confidence in the misinformation provided by flight computers than in their own skills.&lt;ref name="international Journal of Aviation Psychology"/&gt;

An important factor in aviation-related automation bias is the degree to which pilots perceive themselves as responsible for the tasks being carried out by automated aids. One study of pilots showed that the presence of a second crewmember in the cockpit did not affect automation bias. A 1994 study compared the impact of low and high levels of automation (LOA) on pilot performance, and concluded that pilots working with a high LOA spent less time reflecting independently on flight decisions.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

In another study, all of the pilots given false automated alerts that instructed them to shut off an engine did so, even though those same pilots insisted in an interview that they would not respond to such an alert by shutting down an engine, and would instead have reduced the power to idle. One 1998 study found that pilots with approximately 440 hours of flight experience detected more automation failures than did nonpilots, although both groups showed complacency effects. A 2001 study of pilots using a cockpit automation system, the [[Engine-indicating and crew-alerting system]] (EICAS), showed evidence of complacency. The pilots detected fewer engine malfunctions when using the system than when performing the task manually.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

In a 2005 study, experienced air-traffic controllers used high-fidelity simulation of an [[Air traffic control|ATC]] (Free Flight) scenario that involved the detection of conflicts among "self-separating" aircraft. They had access to an automated device that identified potential conflicts several minutes ahead of time. When the device failed near the end of the simulation process, considerably fewer controllers detected the conflict than when the situation was handled manually. Other studies have produced similar findings.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

Two studies of automation bias in aviation discovered a higher rate of commission errors than omission errors, while another aviation study found 55% omission rates and 0% commission rates.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt; Automation-related omissions errors are especially common during the cruise phase of When a [[China Airlines]] flight lost power in one engine, the autopilot attempted to correct for this problem by lowering the left wing, an action that hid the problem from the crew. When the autopilot was disengaged, the airplane rolled to the right and descended steeply, causing extensive damage. The 1983 shooting down of a Korean Airlines 747 over [[Soviet]] airspace occurred because the Korean crew "relied on automation that had been inappropriately set up, and they never checked their progress manually."&lt;ref name="international Journal of Aviation Psychology"/&gt;

===Health care===
[[Clinical decision support system]]s (CDSS) are designed to aid clinical decision-making. They have the potential to effect a great improvement in this regard, and to result in improved patient outcomes. Yet while CDSS, when used properly, bring about an overall improvement in performance, they also cause errors that may not be recognized owing to automation bias. One danger is that the incorrect advice given by these systems may cause users to change a correct decision that they have made on their own. Given the highly serious nature of some of the potential consequences of AB in the health-care field, it is especially important to be aware of this problem when it occurs in clinical settings.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt;

Sometimes automation bias in clinical settings is a major problem that renders CDSS, on balance, counterproductive; sometimes it is  minor problem, with the benefits outweighing the damage done. One study found more automation bias among older users, but it was noted that could be a result not of age but of experience. Studies suggest, indeed, that familiarity with CDSS often leads to desensitization and habituation effects. Although automation bias occurs more often among persons who are inexperienced in a given task, inexperienced users exhibit the most performance improvement when they use CDSS. In one study, the use of CDSS improved clinicians' answers by 21%, from 29% to 50%, with 7% of correct non-CDSS answers being changed incorrectly.&lt;ref name="J Am Med Inform Association"/&gt;

A 2005 study found that when [[Primary care physician|primary-care physicians]] used electronic sources such as [[PubMed]], [[Medline]], and [[Google]], there was a "small to medium" increase in correct answers, while in an equally small percentage of instances the physicians were misled by their use of those sources, and changed correct to incorrect answers.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

Studies in 2004 and 2008 that involved the effect of automated aids on diagnosis of [[breast cancer]] found clear evidence of automation bias involving omission errors. Cancers diagnosed in 46% of cases without automated aids were discovered in only 21% of cases with automated aids that failed to identify the cancer.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

===Military===
Automation bias can be a crucial factor in the use of intelligent decision support systems for military command-and-control operations. One 2004 study found that automation bias effects have contributed to a number of fatal military decisions, including [[friendly-fire]] killings during the [[Iraq War]]. Researchers have sought to determine the proper LOA for decision support systems in this field.&lt;ref name="The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society"/&gt;

==Correcting bias==
Automation bias can be mitigated by the design of automated systems, such as reducing the prominence of the display, decreasing detail or complexity of information displayed, or couching automated assistance as supportive information rather than as directives or commands.&lt;ref name=goddard2012 /&gt; Training on an automated system, which includes introducing deliberate errors has been shown to be significantly more effective at reducing automation bias than just informing users that errors can occur.&lt;ref name=bahner2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bahner|first1=J. Elin|last2=Hüper|first2=Anke-Dorothea|last3=Manzey|first3=Dietrich|title=Misuse of automated decision aids: Complacency, automation bias and the impact of training experience|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|date=2008|volume=66|issue=9|pages=688–699|doi=10.1016/j.ijhcs.2008.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, excessive checking and questioning automated assistance can increase time pressures and complexity of tasks thus reducing the benefits of automated assistance, so design of an automated decision support system can balance positive and negative effects rather than attempt to eliminate negative effects.&lt;ref name=Alberdi2009 /&gt;

These changes are largely deleterious, having a negative effect on fitness; however, they can also be neutral and even advantageous.&lt;ref name="Futuyma 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2007PNAS..104.6504S |jstor=25427413 |title=Prevalence of positive selection among nearly neutral amino acid replacements in ''Drosophila'' |last1=Sawyer |first1=Stanley A. |last2=Parsch |first2=John |last3=Zhang |first3=Zhi |last4=Hartl |first4=Daniel L. |volume=104 |year=2007 |pages=6504–10 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701572104 |issue=16 |pmid=17409186 |pmc=1871816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is theorized that these mutations, along with [[Recombination (biology)|genetic recombination]], are the raw material upon which [[natural selection]] can act to form evolutionary processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carroll |first1=Sean B. |last2=Grenier |first2=Jennifer |last3=Weatherbee |first3=Scott |year=2005 |title=From DNA to Diversity: Molecular Genetics and the Evolution of Animal Design |edition=2nd |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=978-1-4051-1950-4}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to selection's tendency to "pick and choose" mutations which are advantageous and pass them on to an organism's offspring, while discarding deleterious mutations. In [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] lineages, these mutations will always be passed on, causing them to become a crucial factor in whether the lineage will survive or go extinct.&lt;ref name="Futuyma 2009" /&gt;

Behaviour mutations have important implications on the nature of the evolution of animal behaviour. They can help us understand how different forms of behaviour evolve, especially behaviour which can seem strange or out of place. In other cases, they can help us understand how important patterns of behaviour were able to arise – on the back of a simple gene mutation.&lt;ref name="Hamilton1964"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 |title=The genetical evolution of social behaviour.

== History ==
Ethology, the study of animal behaviour, has been a topic of interest since the 1930s. The pioneers of the field include great names such as Dutch biologist [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and Austrian biologists [[Karl von Frisch]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/sBIPH-004-0537-z |title=Instinct in the '50s: The British reception of Konrad Lorenz's theory of instinctive behavior |year=2004 |last1=Griffiths |first1=Paul E. |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=609–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tinbergen |first=Niko |title=The Animal in its World: Explorations of an Ethologist 1932–1972 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=London |year=1973}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.05.002 |title=A gene mutation which changed animal behaviour: Margaret Bastock and the yellow fly |year=2007 |last1=Cobb |first1=Matthew |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=163–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the three won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973 for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1973 |publisher=Nobel Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first published demonstration of how a mutation in a single gene could change an organism's behaviour was carried out by [[Margaret Bastock]] in 1956, while she was a Ph.D. student working under Tinbergen at Oxford University.&lt;ref name="Cobb 2007" /&gt;

Bastock investigated the yellow mutant of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', the common fruit fly. Upon comparison of courtship rituals in 19 yellow mutants and 19 wild types, wild types were noted to court 92% of the time, while yellow ones courted only 83% of the time. In addition, when the yellow mutants courted it took them noticeably longer than the wild types. Even after significant generations of crossing, the flies homozygous for the "yellow" allele were less successful in mating with wild type females than their heterozygous brothers. These results led Bastock to conclude that the origin of this deficient mating behaviour was the very same mutant gene that caused yellow discolouration.&lt;ref name="Bastock 1956" /&gt;

Bastock's work directly and indirectly influenced a new way of observing behaviour patterns and analyzing them, as well as changed the way we look at the evolution of these behavioural patterns in animals.&lt;ref name="Hamilton1964" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton1964a" /&gt; However, it was not until much later that her work was fully recognized and accredited in further studies on genes influencing animal behaviour.&lt;ref name="Cobb 2007" /&gt; [[Seymour Benzer]] worked further on ''D. melanogaster'' in the 1960s, focusing on different novel [[phenotypes]] such as [[phototaxis]] and [[circadian rhythms]].&lt;ref name="Benzer 1967"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1967PNAS...58.1112B |jstor=58086 |title=Behavioral Mutants of Drosophila Isolated by Countercurrent Distribution |last1=Benzer |first1=Seymour |volume=58 |year=1967 |pages=1112–9 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |doi=10.1073/pnas.58.3.1112 |pmid=16578662 |issue=3 |pmc=335755}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, J.C.

== Notable experiments ==
Behaviour mutations have been studied in a variety of animals, but most commonly in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' due to being able to produce large numbers with short generation time as well as a rich diversity of behaviours. Many tests have been used in drosophila by specifying behavioural mutations to further understand the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Benzer 1967"/&gt; In order to understand how behaviour is controlled by the nervous system, it's key to identify the neuronal substrates important for the specific activity studied, as well as to explain how they are incorporated into a functional circuit. Most tests used allowed researches to directly observe the mutation, such as altering [[phototaxis]] or flight-reduction. It was also shown in some experiments that certain mutations affect experience-based behaviour. Behavioural mutation has also been extensively tested in mice.

In one test involving ''Drosophila'', a temperature-sensitive allele of shibire is overexpressed in neuronal subsets using the [[GAL4/UAS system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/neu.1018 |title=Conditional modification of behavior inDrosophila by targeted expression of a temperature-sensitiveshibire allele in defined neurons |year=2001 |last1=Kitamoto |first1=Toshihiro |journal=Journal of Neurobiology |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=81–92 |pmid=11291099}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shi gene is used for [[synaptic vesicle]] recycling, and a change in the temperature would cause an accelerated and reversible effect on the synaptic transmission of shi expressing neurons. When shi was tested to cholinergic neurons, the flies showed a quick response to the temperature and were paralyzed within two minutes at 30 degrees, which was reversible. When shi was expressed in [[photoreceptor cell]], fly larva showed temporary temperature-dependent blindness. This experiment shows that shi can be expressed in specific neurons to cause temperature-dependent alterations in behaviours. This research will further be helpful in studying the neuronal subsets in the behaviour of intact animals due to the reversible and controlled manner it is performed in.

In more recent studies the [[Zebrafish]] ennui mutation was identified from mutagenesis identification for defects in early behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/dneu.20569 |title=The zebrafishennui behavioral mutation disrupts acetylcholine receptor localization and motor axon stability |year=2008 |last1=Saint-Amant |first1=Louis |last2=Sprague |first2=Shawn M. |last3=Hirata |first3=Hiromi |last4=Li |first4=Qin |last5=Cui |first5=Wilson W. |last6=Zhou |first6=Weibin |last7=Poudou |first7=Olivier |last8=Hume |first8=Richard I. |last9=Kuwada |first9=John Y. |journal=Developmental Neurobiology |volume=68 |pages=45–61 |pmid=17918238 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homozygous ennui embryo swam more slowly than the wild-type but gained normal swimming as it aged. When tested, the motor output of the [[central nervous system]] following mechano-sensory stimulation was normal in ennui, which means that the reaction-time and reaction-style was normal to the wild-types and the [[motoneuron]] were not affected. The synaptic current at the neuromuscular junction was significantly reduced in ennui which means that the [[neuromuscular junction]] was affected. The [[acetylcholine receptor]] were significantly reduced in the adult ennui in size as well as localization at the [[myotome]] segment borders of fast-twitch muscles. [[Genetic mosaic]] analysis revealed that ennui is necessary cell autonomously in muscle fibers for normal synaptic localization of acetylcholine receptors. Also, ennui is very important for [[agrin]] function. Ennui is very important in nerve-dependent acetylcholine clustering and the stability of axon growth.

In mice, chemical mutagenesis is a phenotype-driven approach to map the mouse mutant catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Nolan |first1=P |last2=Peters |first2=J |last3=Vizor |first3=L |last4=Washbourne |first4=R |last5=Thornton |first5=C |last6=Glenister |first6=P |last7=Greenaway |first7=S |last8=Hewitt |first8=M |year=1999 |title=Systematic approaches to identifying novel behavioural mutations using ENU mutagenesis |conference=13th International Mouse Genome Conference |location=Philadelphia |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/126922/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of mice in behavioural mutation tests allows scientists to increase our understanding of the genetic basis of mammalian behaviour as well as applying this information to human [[neurological disorder]]s and [[psychiatric disorder]]s. [[SHIRPA]] is a hierarchal screening protocol that efficiently searches for mutations in muscle and lower [[Motor neuron#Function|motor neuron function]], [[Spinocerebellar]],|[[:en:Sensory neuron|sensory neuron]] function, [[neuropsychiatry]] function, and [[Autonomic nervous system#Function|autonomic nervous system function]]. The mice are then further tested for defects in parameters that are associated with human psychiatric disorders by using two well-known behaviour tests. The mice are tested for [[locomotor activity]] (LMA) as well as [[prepulse inhibition]] (PPI). For LMA, mice are placed in cages with beam-splitting monitors that will measure the activity of the mice as well as calculate their habituation to that environment.  LMA is recorded in 35-minute time spans in bins of a 5-minute duration. The PPI measures the acoustic startle response, which is an exaggerated response to an unexpected stimulus. The acoustic startle is measured over a range of frequencies and amplitudes to calculate the average response. These tests allow us to detect abnormal behaviours and document them.

== Behavioural degradation under spontaneous mutation accumulation ==

In each generation, the [[genetic variation]] within a population increases due to accumulation of [[mutation]]s and decreases in response to [[natural selection]] and [[genetic drift]]. Mutation accumulation occurs when mutations of small effect accumulate at certain [[Locus (genetics)|loci]], yielding a large phenotypic effect in the aggregate. Multiple genes may simultaneously affect behavioural traits. [[Mutation#Spontaneous mutation|Spontaneous mutations]] arise from sources including errors in [[DNA replication]], spontaneous lesions, and [[Transposable element|transposable genetic elements]] in the absence of [[mutagen]]s. Spontaneous mutations play a central role in the maintenance of genetic variation and persistence of natural population of many organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.39.110707.173437 |title=Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation Studies in Evolutionary Genetics |year=2009 |last1=Halligan |first1=Daniel L. |last2=Keightley |first2=Peter D. |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=40 |pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01276.x |title=Fitness Recovery and Compensatory Evolution in Natural Mutant Lines of C. Elegans |year=2011 |last1=Estes |first1=Suzanne |last2=Phillips |first2=Patrick C. |last3=Denver |first3=Dee R. |journal=Evolution |volume=65 |issue=8 |pages=2335–44 |pmid=21790579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary biologists have used mutation accumulation experiments, in which mutations are allowed to drift to fixation in [[inbred line]]s, to study the effect of spontaneous mutations on [[phenotype]] character. Phenotypic assays significantly determine whether and how quickly population with accumulated deleterious mutational loads can result in degradation of behavioural responses over time.&lt;ref name="Futuyma 2009"/&gt;

Based on laboratory experimental evolution with long-term mutation accumulation (MA) lines of the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', a team of researchers at the [[University of Oregon]] investigated that mutation accumulation of behaviour is capable of generating significant levels of individual variation in ecologically relevant behavioural traits within populations. This variation will be dependent largely on the [[genetic structure]] and demographic characteristics of individuals. As a result, small or isolated populations are at high risk of experiencing behavioural degradation. For instance, the rate of mutation for behavioural traits has more effects for behavioural mutation within [[Captive breeding|captive populations]] and some [[endangered species]]. The study of two closely related behavioural traits of the free-living soil nematode [[Caenorhabditis elegans|''C. elegans'']], [[chemotaxis]] and [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]], indicates that behavioural degradation is a direct source of competitive [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] loss under genomic mutation accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1534/genetics.104.040014 |title=Behavioral Degradation Under Mutation Accumulation in ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' |year=2005 |last1=Ajie |first1=Beverly C. |journal=Genetics |volume=170 |issue=2 |pages=655–60 |pmid=15834141 |last2=Estes |first2=Suzanne |last3=Lynch |first3=Michael |last4=Phillips |first4=Patrick C. |pmc=1450389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond B. Huey]] and his colleagues used the same MA lines method, suggesting that mutation accumulation in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' significantly depresses only some behavioural traits. There are several explanations for this. It is possible that traits are influenced only by few [[locus (genetics)|loci]] so that their mutational target is small. Alternatively, the values of the behavioural traits are not maximized by [[directional selection]], but rather are under the influence of [[stabilizing selection]]. Since behavioural traits are highly variable, mutation accumulation does not negatively affect all traits equivalently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/icb/43.3.387 |jstor=3884985 |title=Mutation Accumulation, Performance, Fitness |year=2003 |last1=Huey |first1=Raymond B. |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=387–95 |pmid=21680447 |last2=Gilchrist |first2=George W. |last3=Ward |first3=Kimiora |last4=Maves |first4=Lisa |last5=Pepin |first5=David |last6=Houle |first6=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex-ratio behaviour ===
The study of [[sex allocation]] has provided some of the most convincing tests of adaptive behaviour. Theory predicts that organisms can adjust the allocation of resources to male and female offspring in response to environmental conditions. [[Sex ratio]] behaviour is the sex ratio response of a female in various conditions. Mutation accumulation is important because it is one evolutionary cause that increases variation between individuals in sex-ratio behaviour. For example, female wasps can adjust their offspring sex ratios by choosing whether to fertilize an egg because they are [[haplodiploid]]. In particular, female ''Nasonia vitripennis'' produce less males when laying eggs alone, and more males when laying eggs on a patch with other females. If female parasitoid wasps produce too few male offspring, then some of the female offspring will remain unmated. On the other hand, if too many sons are produced, then resources are wasted that could have been used to produce more daughters. Females of other strains show no similar conditional sex ratio behaviours. Researchers find that these behaviours are indeed subject to genetic variation. However, genetic variation in natural population is low and it has low [[heritability]] as for other fitness-related traits. The observation of this type of behavioural mutation has been argued to pose a problem for sex-ratio theory because the mutations are likely to have decreased fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00434.x |title=Effects of Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation on Sex Ratio Traits in a Parasitoid Wasp |year=2008 |last1=Pannebakker |first1=Bart A. |last2=Halligan |first2=Daniel L. |last3=Reynolds |first3=K.

== Mutations affecting passive/aggressive characteristics ==
[[Aggression]] is a survival trait that can be favoured by [[Natural selection|Natural Selection]] in nearly any species. Aggressive individuals can be better able to compete for resources including food, territory and mates, as well as more successful in protecting themselves and their progeny from predators. It can also be energetically costly, and extreme or out of context aggression can be disadvantageous or deleterious, especially in social organisms.&lt;ref name="Edwards et al 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020154 |title=Quantitative Genomics of Aggressive Behavior in Drosophila melanogaster |year=2006 |last1=Edwards |first1=Alexis C. |last2=Rollmann |first2=Stephanie M. |last3=Morgan |first3=Theodore J. |last4=MacKay |first4=Trudy F. C. |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=e154 |pmid=17044737 |pmc=1564424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aggression is a complex trait that is regulated by many interacting genes and [[gene expression]] is highly variable depending on environment ([[phenotypic plasticity]]). Mutations in genes that influence aggressive behaviours can potentially increase aggression or [[deference|passivity]].

=== Neurotransmitters ===
[[Neurotransmitters]], [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]] in particular, play an important role in the regulation of aggressive behaviours. Many studies are focused on genes that change the way neurotransmitters interact with receptors within the organism. For example, when individuals suffer from a mutation that causes them to have low levels of serotonin, there is an observed increase in impulsivity and depression&lt;ref name="Brunner et al 1993"/&gt; With neurotranmitters playing such a central role in the development of aggressive behaviour, it isn't surprising that many of the gene mutations that have been implicated with aggressive behaviours are involved in the breakdown and/or receipt of neurotransmitters.

Alexis Edwards and her team identified 59 mutations in 57 genes that affected aggressive behaviour in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''.&lt;ref name="Edwards et al 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1741-7007-7-29 |title=Mutations in many genes affect aggressive behavior in Drosophila melanogaster |year=2009 |last1=Edwards |first1=Alexis C |last2=Zwarts |first2=Liesbeth |last3=Yamamoto |first3=Akihiko |last4=Callaerts |first4=Patrick |last5=MacKay |first5=Trudy FC |journal=BMC Biology |volume=7 |pages=29 |pmid=19519879 |pmc=2707370}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of their research showed that 32 of the mutants displayed increased aggression and 27 of the mutants displayed less aggression than the control group.  Several of the genes examined were found to affect [[nervous system]] development and function. Aggression was assessed in this experiment by depriving [[mutant]] Drosophila flies from food and then allowing them to defend a limited food source. The number of contest competitions between flies was recorded and compared to non-mutant flies to assess whether the mutants were more or less aggressive than the [[wild type]]. Examples of mutations that increase aggression are mutations in the [[Fruitless (gene)|''fruitless'']] or ''dissatisfaction'' genes which result in observable increases in male-male aggression.&lt;ref name="Edwards et al 2009"/&gt;

=== Amines ===

Mutations involving [[amines]] have been shown to be a prevalent source of changes in behaviour. A [[point mutation]] in the structural gene for [[Monoamine Oxidase A]], also known as MAO-A, is responsible for the breakdown of neurotransmitters.&lt;ref name="Brunner et al 1993"/&gt; This mutation is [[X-linked]], affecting only males, and eliminates the production of MAO-A. Males afflicted with this mutation are prone to mild mental retardation as well as violent and [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial behaviour]]. Another amine affecting aggression is [[β-alanine]] which is a bioamine neurotransmitter that has been implicated in Drosophila aggression. A mutation known as the ''black'' mutation causes reduced levels of β-alanine and results in less reactive flies than the wild type.

=== Testosterone ===
In nearly all species, there is an obvious disequilibrium between frequency and severity of aggression in males versus females.&lt;ref name="Jasnow et al 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/hbeh.2000.1604 |title=Short-Day Increases in Aggression Are Inversely Related to Circulating Testosterone Concentrations in Male Siberian Hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) |year=2000 |last1=Jasnow |first1=Aaron M. |last2=Huhman |first2=Kim L. |last3=Bartness |first3=Timothy J. |last4=Demas |first4=Gregory E. |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=102–10 |pmid=10964524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males are almost always the more aggressive sex and there are genetic differences that back up this observation. A common explanation for this phenomenon is the higher [[testosterone]] levels in males. Testosterone levels have a direct effect on neurotransmitter functioning contributing to physical aggression. Mutations affecting neurotransmitters, as stated above, are the dominanting cause of changes in aggressive behaviour. Another contributors to the unequal male-female aggression ratio are the sex-linked gene mutations that affect only male behaviour, such as MAO-A mentioned above. These mutations could be the reason why males are nearly always more aggressive than females, although, testosterone levels are a much more feasible explanation.

Other evolutionary and genetic explanations of violent behaviour include: dopamine receptors mutations, [[DRD2]] and [[DRD4]],&lt;ref name="Brunner et al 1993" /&gt; that, when mutate simultaneously, are hypothesized to cause [[personality disorders]], low serotonin levels increasing irritability and gloom&lt;ref name="Edwards et al 2006"/&gt; and the effects of testosterone&lt;ref name="Jasnow et al 2000" /&gt; on neurotransmitter functioning to explain the increased occurrence of aggression in males.

== Effects of mutations on mating ==
Behavioural mutations play a detrimental part towards the [[genome]]s of many species, however they can greatly affect the outcome of [[mating]]; affecting the success of fitness, how many offspring will arise and the likelihood that the male will actually procreate. When [[mutation]]s affect the mating habits of species, different traits that would otherwise benefit the species procreating are compromised.

A couple chemicals that are altered from mutation and have a great impact on mating, are [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]]. Each of these chemicals either has a reaction to how the animal acts, or how the species body is formed to benefit their mating success. An example of a mutation in serotonin was found in a species of [[Nematode]]s. The serotonin caused their tails to curl during mating, when the mutation occurred the tails did not curl. Without the curling of the tail the nematode was unlikely to find the hermaphrodites sex organs to procreate, and results in less of that nematodes sperm being spread to other offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Loer |first1=Curtis M. |last2=Kenyon |first2=Cynthia J. |year=1993 |title=Serotonin-deficient mutants and male mating behavior in the nematode ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |pmid=8254383 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8254383 |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=5407–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is when the [[Dopamine receptor D1|D1 dopamine receptor]] has a mutation on it; the arousal of a ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' is increased, which also increases the courtship of the animal.&lt;ref name="sdbonline"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Thomas B. |last1=Brody |title=Two different forms of arousal in Drosophila are oppositely regulated by the dopamine D1 receptor ortholog DopR via distinct neural circuits |year=1996 |work=The Interactive Fly |url=http://www.sdbonline.org/fly/aimain/6behavior.htm#Arousal}}{{self-published inline|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a study was found in the 'yellow' ''D.melanogaster'', the mating of these males was only beneficial when it was dark outside, or when they were in a dark environment. The mutation is not yet known why it occurs this way, but studies have mentioned that the females of this fly species may be turned off by the certain colour of the mutated fly, and therefore in the dark the female is less likely to tell what colour this fly is.&lt;ref name="sdbonline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HeyJody"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Jody |editor1-last=Hey |editor2-first=Walter M. |editor2-last=Fitch |editor3-first=Francisco J. |editor3-last=Ayala |chapter=Drosophila mating behavior |chapterurl=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11310&amp;page=308 |title=Systematics and the Origin of Species |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Academies Press |year=2005 |pages=308–31 |isbn=978-0-309-09536-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A beneficial component of a mutation in the behaviour of a mating ''D. melanogaster'', was when the mutation caused the male to have a longer courtship time period. The flies that had a longer courtship had a tendency to have a higher probability of procreating. This means that the fly that took longer to actually initiate the courtship with the female fly, was more likely to be successful with the female successfully accepting the male.&lt;ref name="HeyJody" /&gt;

[[File:Black body.svg|thumb|303px|As the temperature decreases, the peak of the black-body radiation curve moves to lower intensities and longer wavelengths. The black-body radiation graph is also compared with the classical model of Rayleigh and Jeans.]]

[[Image:PlanckianLocus.png|thumb|303px|The color ([[chromaticity]]) of black-body radiation depends on the temperature of the black body; the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of such colors, shown here in [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931 ''x,y'' space]], is known as the [[Planckian locus]].]]

'''Black-body radiation''' is the [[thermal radiation|thermal]] [[electromagnetic radiation]] within or surrounding a body in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its environment, or emitted by a [[black body]] (an opaque and non-reflective body).  It has a specific spectrum and intensity that depends only on the body's temperature, which is assumed for the sake of calculations and theory to be uniform and constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loudon|2000}}, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mandel|Wolf|1995}}, Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kondepudi|Prigogine|1998}}, Chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Landsberg&gt;{{harvnb|Landsberg|1990}}, Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The thermal radiation spontaneously emitted by many ordinary objects can be approximated as black-body radiation.  A perfectly insulated enclosure that is in thermal equilibrium internally contains black-body radiation and will emit it through a hole made in its wall, provided the hole is small enough to have negligible effect upon the equilibrium.

A black-body at room temperature appears black, as most of the energy it radiates is [[infra-red]] and cannot be perceived by the human eye. Because the human eye cannot perceive light waves at lower frequencies, a black body, viewed in the dark at the lowest just faintly visible temperature, subjectively appears grey, even though its objective physical spectrum peak is in the infrared range.&lt;ref&gt;[[J.R. Partington|Partington, J.R.]] (1949), p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt; When it becomes a little hotter, it appears dull red. As its temperature increases further it becomes yellow, white, and ultimately blue-white.

Although planets and stars are neither in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings nor perfect [[black body|black bodies]], black-body radiation is used as a first approximation for the energy they emit.&lt;ref name=Morison&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Astronomy and Cosmology |author=Ian Morison |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yrV8vvJzgWkC&amp;pg=PA48 |page=48 |isbn=0-470-03333-9 |year=2008 |publisher=J Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black holes]] are near-perfect black bodies, in the sense that they absorb all the radiation that falls on them. It has been proposed that they emit black-body radiation (called [[Hawking radiation]]), with a temperature that depends on the mass of the black hole.&lt;ref name=Fabbri&gt;{{cite book |title=Modeling black hole evaporation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUhZZtb6yA8C&amp;pg=PA1 |chapter=Chapter 1: Introduction |author1=Alessandro Fabbri |author2=José Navarro-Salas |isbn=1-86094-527-9 |year=2005 |publisher=Imperial College Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''black body'' was introduced by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;From (Kirchhoff, 1860) (''Annalen der Physik und Chemie''), p. 277:  ''"Der Beweis, welcher für die ausgesprochene Behauptung hier gegeben werden soll, … ''vollkommen schwarze'', oder kürzer ''schwarze'', nennen."''  (The proof, which shall be given here for the proposition stated [above], rests on the assumption that bodies are conceivable which in the case of infinitely small thicknesses, completely absorb all rays that fall on them, thus [they] neither reflect nor transmit rays.  I will call such bodies "completely black [bodies]" or more briefly "black [bodies]".)  See also (Kirchhoff, 1860) (''Philosophical Magazine''), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Black-body radiation is also called [[thermal radiation]], ''cavity radiation'', ''complete radiation'' or ''temperature radiation''.

==Spectrum==
Black-body radiation has a characteristic, continuous [[spectral energy distribution|frequency spectrum]] that depends only on the body's temperature,&lt;ref name=Kogure&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  called the Planck spectrum or [[Planck's law]].  The spectrum is peaked at a characteristic frequency that shifts to higher frequencies with increasing temperature, and at [[room temperature]] most of the emission is in the [[infrared]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;Wien, W.

Viewed in the dark by the human eye, the first faint glow appears as a "ghostly" grey (the visible light is actually red, but low intensity light activates only the eye's grey-level sensors). With rising temperature, the glow becomes visible even when there is some background surrounding light: first as a dull red, then yellow, and eventually a "dazzling bluish-white" as the temperature rises.&lt;ref&gt;[[John William Draper|Draper, J.W.]] (1847).

The Sun, with an [[effective temperature]] of approximately 5800 K,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goody|Yung|1989|pages=482, 484}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an approximate black body with an emission spectrum peaked in the central, yellow-green part of the [[visible spectrum]], but with significant power in the ultraviolet as well.

Black-body radiation provides insight into the [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] state of cavity radiation. If each [[Fourier mode]] of the equilibrium radiation in an otherwise empty cavity with perfectly reflective walls is considered as a degree of freedom capable of exchanging energy, then, according to the [[equipartition theorem]] of classical physics, there would be an equal amount of energy in each mode.  Since there are an infinite number of modes this implies infinite [[heat capacity]] (infinite energy at any non-zero temperature), as well as an unphysical spectrum of emitted radiation that grows without bound with increasing frequency, a problem known as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].  Instead, in quantum theory the [[quantum field theory|occupation numbers]] of the modes are quantized, cutting off the spectrum at high frequency in agreement with experimental observation and resolving the catastrophe.  The study of the laws of black bodies and the failure of classical physics to describe them helped establish the foundations of [[history of quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]].

[[Image:Color temperature black body 800-12200K.svg|thumb|512px|Color of a black body from 800 K to 12200 K. This range of colors approximates the range of colors of stars of different temperatures, as seen or photographed in the night sky.]]

All normal ([[baryon]]ic) matter emits electromagnetic radiation when it has a temperature above [[absolute zero]]. The radiation represents a conversion of a body's internal energy into electromagnetic energy, and is therefore called [[thermal radiation]]. It is a [[spontaneous process]] of radiative distribution of [[entropy]].

Conversely all normal matter absorbs electromagnetic radiation to some degree. An object that absorbs all radiation falling on it, at all [[wavelength]]s, is called a black body. When a black body is at a uniform temperature, its emission has a characteristic frequency distribution that depends on the temperature. Its emission is called black-body radiation.

The concept of the black body is an idealization, as perfect black bodies do not exist in nature.&lt;ref name="Planck 1914 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graphite]] and [[carbon black|lamp black]], with emissivities greater than 0.95, however, are good approximations to a black material. Experimentally, black-body radiation may be established best as the ultimately stable steady state equilibrium radiation in a cavity in a rigid body, at a uniform temperature, that is entirely opaque and is only partly reflective.&lt;ref name="Planck 1914 42"/&gt;  A closed box of graphite walls at a constant temperature with a small hole on one side produces a good approximation to ideal black-body radiation emanating from the opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wien|1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black-body radiation has the unique absolutely stable distribution of radiative intensity that can persist in thermodynamic equilibrium in a cavity.&lt;ref name="Planck 1914 42"/&gt; In equilibrium, for each frequency the total intensity of radiation that is emitted and reflected from a body (that is, the net amount of radiation leaving its surface, called the ''spectral radiance'') is determined solely by the equilibrium temperature, and does not depend upon the shape, material or structure of the body.&lt;ref name=Caniou&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-aFGcf6pOEC&amp;pg=PA107 |page=107 |chapter=§4.2.2: Calculation of Planck's law |title=Passive infrared detection: theory and applications |author=Joseph Caniou |isbn=0-7923-8532-2 |year=1999 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a black body (a perfect absorber) there is no reflected radiation, and so the spectral radiance is entirely due to emission.  In addition, a black body is a diffuse emitter (its emission is independent of direction). Consequently, black-body radiation may be viewed as the radiation from a black body at thermal equilibrium.

Black-body radiation becomes a visible glow of light if the temperature of the object is high enough. The [[Draper point]] is the temperature at which all solids glow a dim red, about {{val|798|u=K}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At {{val|1000|u=K}}, a small opening in the wall of a large uniformly heated opaque-walled cavity (let us call it an oven), viewed from outside, looks red; at {{val|6000|u=K}}, it looks white. No matter how the oven is constructed, or of what material, as long as it is built so that almost all light entering is absorbed by its walls, it will contain a good approximation to black-body radiation.  The spectrum, and therefore color, of the light that comes out will be a function of the cavity temperature alone. A graph of the amount of energy inside the oven per unit volume and per unit frequency interval plotted versus frequency, is called the ''black-body curve''. Different curves are obtained by varying the temperature.

Two bodies that are at the same temperature stay in mutual thermal equilibrium, so a body at temperature ''T'' surrounded by a cloud of light at temperature ''T'' on average will emit as much light into the cloud as it absorbs, following Prevost's exchange principle, which refers to [[radiative equilibrium]]. The principle of [[detailed balance]] says that in thermodynamic equilibrium every elementary process works equally in its forward and backward sense.&lt;ref&gt;de Groot, SR., Mazur, P. (1962). ''Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics'', North-Holland, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kondepudi|Prigogine|1998}}, Section 9.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Prevost also showed that the emission from a body is logically determined solely by its own internal state. The causal effect of thermodynamic absorption on thermodynamic (spontaneous) emission is not direct, but is only indirect as it affects the internal state of the body. This means that at thermodynamic equilibrium the amount of every wavelength in every direction of thermal radiation emitted by a body at temperature ''T'', black or not, is equal to the corresponding amount that the body absorbs because it is surrounded by light at temperature ''T''.&lt;ref name="Stewart 1858"/&gt;

When the body is black, the absorption is obvious: the amount of light absorbed is all the light that hits the surface. For a black body much bigger than the wavelength, the light energy absorbed at any wavelength ''λ'' per unit time is strictly proportional to the black-body curve. This means that the black-body curve is the amount of light energy emitted by a black body, which justifies the name. This is the  condition for the applicability of [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]: the black-body curve is characteristic of thermal light, which depends only on the [[temperature]] of the walls of the cavity, provided that the walls of the cavity are completely opaque and are not very reflective, and that the cavity is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;{{cite book |last=Huang |first=Kerson|title=Statistical Mechanics |year=1967 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York |isbn=0-471-81518-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the black body is small, so that its size is comparable to the wavelength of light, the absorption is modified, because a small object is not an efficient absorber of light of long wavelength, but the principle of strict equality of emission and absorption is always upheld in a condition of thermodynamic equilibrium.

In the laboratory, black-body radiation is approximated by the radiation from a small hole in a large cavity, a [[hohlraum]], in an entirely opaque body that is only partly reflective, that is maintained at a constant temperature. (This technique leads to the alternative term ''cavity radiation''.) Any light entering the hole would have to reflect off the walls of the cavity multiple times before it escaped, in which process it is nearly certain to be absorbed. Absorption occurs regardless of the [[wavelength]] of the radiation entering (as long as it is small compared to the hole). The hole, then, is a close approximation of a theoretical black body and, if the cavity is heated, the [[Power spectral density|spectrum]] of the hole's radiation (i.e., the amount of light emitted from the hole at each wavelength) will be continuous, and will depend only on the temperature and the fact that the walls are opaque and at least partly absorptive, but not on the particular material of which they are built nor on the material in the cavity (compare with [[emission spectrum]]).

Calculating the black-body curve was a major challenge in [[theoretical physics]] during the late nineteenth century. The problem was solved in 1901 by [[Max Planck]] in the formalism now known as [[Planck's law]] of black-body radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making changes to [[Wien's radiation law]] (not to be confused with [[Wien's displacement law]]) consistent with [[thermodynamics]] and [[electromagnetism]], he found a mathematical expression fitting the experimental data satisfactorily. Planck had to assume that the energy of the oscillators in the cavity was quantized, i.e., it existed in integer multiples of some quantity. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] built on this idea and proposed the quantization of electromagnetic radiation itself in 1905 to explain the [[photoelectric effect]]. These theoretical advances eventually resulted in the superseding of classical electromagnetism by [[quantum electrodynamics]]. These quanta were called [[photon]]s and the black-body cavity was thought of as containing a [[photon gas|gas of photons]]. In addition, it led to the development of quantum probability distributions, called [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] and [[Bose–Einstein statistics]], each applicable to a different class of particles, [[fermion]]s and [[boson]]s.

The wavelength at which the radiation is strongest is given by Wien's displacement law, and the overall power emitted per unit area is given by the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]. So, as temperature increases, the glow color changes from red to yellow to white to blue. Even as the peak wavelength moves into the ultra-violet, enough radiation continues to be emitted in the blue wavelengths that the body will continue to appear blue. It will never become invisible—indeed, the radiation of visible light increases [[monotonic function|monotonically]] with temperature.&lt;ref name="Landau"&gt;{{cite book |last=Landau |first=L. D.|author2=E. M. Lifshitz|title=Statistical Physics |edition=3rd Edition Part 1 |year=1996|publisher=Butterworth–Heinemann |location=Oxford |isbn=0-521-65314-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stefan–Boltzmann law also says that the total radiant heat energy emitted from a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its [[absolute temperature]]. The law was formulated by Josef Stefan in 1879 and later derived by Ludwig Boltzmann. The formula {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''σT''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} is given, where ''E'' is the radiant heat emitted from a unit of area per unit time, ''T'' is the absolute temperature, and {{nowrap|1=''σ'' = {{val|5.670367|e=-8|u=W·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;⋅K&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]] .&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/science/Stefan-Boltzmann-law&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[radiance]] or observed intensity is not a function of direction. Therefore, a black body is a perfect [[Lambert's cosine law|Lambertian]] radiator.

Real objects never behave as full-ideal black bodies, and instead the emitted radiation at a given frequency is a fraction of what the ideal emission would be. The [[emissivity]] of a material specifies how well a real body radiates energy as compared with a black body. This emissivity depends on factors such as temperature, emission angle, and wavelength. However, it is typical in engineering to assume that a surface's spectral emissivity and absorptivity do not depend on wavelength, so that the emissivity is a constant. This is known as the ''gray body'' assumption.

With non-black surfaces, the deviations from ideal black-body behavior are determined by both the surface structure, such as roughness or granularity, and the chemical composition. On a "per wavelength" basis, real objects in states of [[Thermodynamic equilibrium#Local and global equilibrium|local thermodynamic equilibrium]] still follow [[Kirchhoff's law (thermodynamics)|Kirchhoff's Law]]: emissivity equals absorptivity, so that an object that does not absorb all incident light will also emit less radiation than an ideal black body; the incomplete absorption can be due to some of the incident light being transmitted through the body or to some of it being reflected at the surface of the body.

In [[astronomy]], objects such as [[star]]s are frequently regarded as black bodies, though this is often a poor approximation. An almost perfect black-body spectrum is exhibited by the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. [[Hawking radiation]] is the hypothetical black-body radiation emitted by [[black hole]]s, at a temperature that depends on the mass, charge, and spin of the hole.  If this prediction is correct, black holes will very gradually shrink and evaporate over time as they lose mass by the emission of photons and other particles.

A black body radiates energy at all frequencies, but its intensity rapidly tends to zero at high frequencies (short wavelengths). For example, a black body at room temperature ({{val|300|u=K}}) with one square meter of surface area will emit a photon in the visible range (390–750&amp;nbsp;nm) at an average rate of one photon every 41 seconds, meaning that for most practical purposes, such a black body does not emit in the visible range.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Planck's law of black-body radiation===

{{Main article|Planck's law}}

Planck's law states that&lt;ref name="Rybicki 1979 22"&gt;{{harvnb|Rybicki|Lightman|1979|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B_\nu(\nu, T) = \frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2}\frac{1}{e^{h\nu/kT} - 1},&lt;/math&gt;
where
:B''&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''(''T'') is the spectral radiance (the [[Power (physics)|power]] per unit [[solid angle]] and per unit of area normal to the propagation) density of frequency ''ν'' radiation per unit [[frequency]] at thermal equilibrium at temperature ''T.''
:''h'' is the [[Planck constant]];
:''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum;
:''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]];
:''ν'' is the [[frequency]] of the electromagnetic radiation;
:''T'' is the absolute [[temperature]] of the body.
For a black body surface the spectral radiance density (defined per unit of area normal to the propagation) is independent of the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; of emission with respect to the normal. However, this means that, following [[Lambert's cosine law]], &lt;math&gt; B_\nu(T) \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt; is the radiance density per unit area of emitting surface as the surface area involved in generating the radiance is increased by a factor &lt;math&gt; 1/\cos \theta&lt;/math&gt; with respect to an area normal to the propagation direction. At oblique angles, the solid angle spans involved do get smaller, resulting in lower aggregate intensities.

===Wien's displacement law===

[[Wien's displacement law]] shows how the spectrum of black-body radiation at any temperature is related to the spectrum at any other temperature. If we know the shape of the spectrum at one temperature, we can calculate the shape at any other temperature. Spectral intensity can be expressed as a function of wavelength or of frequency.

A consequence of Wien's displacement law is that the wavelength at which the intensity ''per unit wavelength'' of the radiation produced by a black body is at a maximum, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\max&lt;/math&gt;, is a function only of the temperature:
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_\max = \frac{b}{T},&lt;/math&gt;
where the constant ''b'', known as Wien's displacement constant, is equal to {{val|2.8977729|(17)|e=-3|u=K m}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?bwien&lt;/ref&gt;

Planck's law was also stated above as a function of frequency. The intensity maximum for this is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\nu_\max = T \times 1.04 \times 10^{11} \ \mathrm{Hz}/\mathrm{K}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

===Stefan–Boltzmann law===
By integrating &lt;math&gt;B_\nu(T)&lt;/math&gt; over the frequency the integrated radiance &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; L=\frac{2\pi^5}{15} \frac{k^4 T^4}{c^2h^3} \frac{1}{\pi}=:\sigma T^4 \frac{1}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

by using &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty dx\, \frac{x^3}{e^x - 1}=\frac{\pi^4}{15}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x \equiv \frac{h\nu}{k T} &lt;/math&gt; and with &lt;math&gt;\sigma \equiv \frac{2\pi^5}{15} \frac{k^4}{c^2h^3}=5.670373 \times 10^{-8} \frac{W}{m^2 K^4}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]]. The radiance &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is then
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma T^4 \frac{\cos \theta}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;
per unit of emitting surface.

On a side note, at a distance d, the intensity &lt;math&gt;dI&lt;/math&gt; per area &lt;math&gt;dA&lt;/math&gt; of radiating surface is the useful expression
:&lt;math&gt; dI=\sigma T^4 \frac{\cos\theta}{\pi d^2}dA&lt;/math&gt;
when the receiving surface is perpendicular to the radiation.

By subsequently integrating over the solid angle &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;) the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]] is calculated, stating that the power ''j''* emitted per unit area of the surface of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature:
:&lt;math&gt;j^\star = \sigma T^4,&lt;/math&gt;
by using
:&lt;math&gt;\int \cos\theta\, d\Omega = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\pi/2}  \cos\theta\sin\theta \,d\theta\,d\phi= \pi.&lt;/math&gt;

The human body radiates energy as [[infrared]] light. The net power radiated is the difference between the power emitted and the power absorbed:
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{net} = P_\text{emit} - P_\text{absorb}.&lt;/math&gt;
Applying the Stefan–Boltzmann law,
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{net} = A \sigma \varepsilon \left( T^4 - T_0^4 \right),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' and ''T'' are the body surface area and temperature, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the [[emissivity]], and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the ambient temperature.

The total surface area of an adult is about 2 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the mid- and far-infrared [[emissivity]] of skin and most clothing is near unity, as it is for most nonmetallic surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{net} = 100~\text{W}.&lt;/math&gt;
The total energy radiated in one day is about 8 [[megajoule|MJ]], or 2000 kcal (food [[calorie]]s).

However, the mean metabolic rate of sedentary adults is about 50% to 70% greater than their basal rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Levine, J|title=Nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT): environment and biology|journal=Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab|volume=286|year=2004|pages=E675–E685|url=http://ajpendo.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/286/5/E675|doi=10.1152/ajpendo.00562.2003|pmid=15102614|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other important thermal loss mechanisms, including [[convection]] and [[evaporation]]. Conduction is negligible – the [[Nusselt number]] is much greater than unity. Evaporation by [[perspiration]] is only required if radiation and convection are insufficient to maintain a steady-state temperature (but evaporation from the lungs occurs regardless). Free-convection rates are comparable, albeit somewhat lower, than radiative rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| author=DrPhysics.com
| title=Heat Transfer and the Human Body
| url=http://www.drphysics.com/convection/convection.html
| accessdate=2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, radiation accounts for about two-thirds of thermal energy loss in cool, still air. Given the approximate nature of many of the assumptions, this can only be taken as a crude estimate. Ambient air motion, causing forced convection, or evaporation reduces the relative importance of radiation as a thermal-loss mechanism.

Application of [[Wien's displacement law|Wien's law]] to human-body emission results in a peak wavelength of
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{peak} = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}~\text{K} \cdot \text{m}}{305~\text{K}} = 9.50~\mu\text{m}.&lt;/math&gt;
For this reason, thermal imaging devices for human subjects are most sensitive in the 7–14 micrometer range.

[[Image:Erbe.gif|thumb|300px|Earth's longwave thermal [[Earth's energy budget#Outgoing energy|radiation]] intensity, from clouds, atmosphere and ground]]
The temperature of a planet depends on several factors:
*Incident radiation from its star
*Emitted radiation of the planet, e.g., [[Earth's energy budget#Outgoing energy|Earth's infrared glow]]
*The [[albedo]] effect causing a fraction of light to be reflected by the planet
*The [[greenhouse effect]] for planets with an atmosphere
*Energy generated internally by a planet itself due to [[radioactive decay]], [[tidal heating]], and [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism|adiabatic contraction due by cooling]].

The analysis only considers the Sun's heat for a planet in a Solar System.

The [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]] gives the total [[power (physics)|power]] (energy/second) the Sun is emitting:

[[Image:Sun-Earth-Radiation.png|frame|The Earth only has an absorbing area equal to a two dimensional disk, rather than the surface of a sphere.]]
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm S\ emt} = 4 \pi R_{\rm S}^2 \sigma T_{\rm S}^4 \qquad \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law|Stefan–Boltzmann constant]],
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\rm S} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the effective temperature of the Sun, and
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\rm S} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the Sun.

The Sun emits that power equally in all directions. Because of this, the planet is hit with only a tiny fraction of it. The power from the Sun that strikes the planet (at the top of the atmosphere) is:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm SE} = P_{\rm S\ emt} \left( \frac{\pi R_{\rm E}^2}{4 \pi D^2} \right) \qquad \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\rm E} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the planet and
:&lt;math&gt;D \,&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the [[Sun]] and the planet.

Because of its high temperature, the Sun emits to a large extent in the ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) frequency range. In this frequency range, the planet reflects a fraction &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of this energy where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[albedo]] or reflectance of the planet in the UV-Vis range. In other words, the planet absorbs a fraction &lt;math&gt;1-\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of the Sun's light, and reflects the rest. The power absorbed by the planet and its atmosphere is then:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm abs} = (1-\alpha)\,P_{\rm SE} \qquad \qquad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

Even though the planet only absorbs as a circular area &lt;math&gt;\pi R^2&lt;/math&gt;, it emits equally in all directions as a sphere. If the planet were a perfect black body, it would emit according to the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm emt\,bb} = 4 \pi R_{\rm E}^2 \sigma T_{\rm E}^4 \qquad \qquad (4)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm E} &lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the planet.  This temperature, calculated for the case of the planet acting as a black body by setting &lt;math&gt;P_{\rm abs} = P_{\rm emt\,bb}&lt;/math&gt;, is known as the [[effective temperature]].  The actual temperature of the planet will likely be different, depending on its surface and atmospheric properties. Ignoring the atmosphere and greenhouse effect, the planet, since it is at a much lower temperature than the Sun, emits mostly in the infrared (IR) portion of the spectrum. In this frequency range, it emits &lt;math&gt;\overline{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; of the radiation that a black body would emit where &lt;math&gt;\overline{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; is the average emissivity in the IR range. The power emitted by the planet is then:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm emt} = \overline{\epsilon}\,P_{\rm emt\,bb} \qquad \qquad (5)&lt;/math&gt;

For a body in [[Radiative equilibrium#Definitions of radiative equilbrium#radiative exchange equilibrium|radiative exchange equilibrium]] with its surroundings, the rate at which it emits radiant energy is equal to the rate at which it absorbs it:&lt;ref name="Prevost 1791"&gt;Prevost, P. (1791). Mémoire sur l'equilibre du feu. ''Journal de Physique'' (Paris), vol 38 pp. 314-322.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iribarne, J.V., Godson, W.L. (1981). ''Atmospheric Thermodynamics'', second edition, D. Reidel Publishing, Dordrecht, {{ISBN|90-277-1296-4}}, page 227.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm abs}=P_{\rm emt} \qquad \qquad (6)&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the expressions for solar and planet power in equations 1–6 and simplifying yields the estimated temperature of the planet, ignoring greenhouse effect, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;T_P = T_S\sqrt{\frac{R_S\sqrt{\frac{1-\alpha}{\overline{\varepsilon}}}}{2D}} \qquad \qquad (7) &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, given the assumptions made, the temperature of a planet depends only on the surface temperature of the Sun, the radius of the Sun, the distance between the planet and the Sun, the albedo and the IR emissivity of the planet.

Notice that a gray (flat spectrum) ball where &lt;math&gt; ({1-\alpha}) ={\overline{\varepsilon}} &lt;/math&gt; comes to the same temperature as a black body no matter how dark or light gray .

===Effective temperature of Earth===

Substituting the measured values for the Sun and Earth yields:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\rm S} = 5778 \ \mathrm{K},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html NASA Sun Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\rm S} = 6.96 \times 10^8 \ \mathrm{m},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;D = 1.496 \times 10^{11} \ \mathrm{m},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 0.306 \ &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cole, George H. A. |author2=Woolfson, Michael M. |title=Planetary Science: The Science of Planets Around Stars (1st ed.)

With the average emissivity &lt;math&gt; \overline{\varepsilon} &lt;/math&gt; set to unity, the [[effective temperature]] of the Earth is:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\rm E} = 254.356\  \mathrm{K}&lt;/math&gt;
or −18.8&amp;nbsp;°C.

This is the temperature of the Earth if it radiated as a perfect black body in the infrared, assuming an unchanging albedo and ignoring [[greenhouse effect]]s (which can raise the surface temperature of a body above what it would be if it were a perfect black body in all spectrums&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Planetary Climate'' by Raymond T. Peirrehumbert, Cambridge University Press (2011), p. 146. From Chapter 3 which is available online [http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~deshler/Atsc4400_5400_Climate/PierreHumbert_Climate_Ch3.pdf here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328102328/http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~deshler/Atsc4400_5400_Climate/PierreHumbert_Climate_Ch3.pdf |date=March 28, 2012 }}, p. 12 mentions that Venus' black-body temperature would be 330 K "in the zero albedo case", but that due to atmospheric warming, its actual surface temperature is 740 K.&lt;/ref&gt;). The Earth in fact radiates not quite as a perfect black body in the infrared which will raise the estimated temperature a few degrees above the effective temperature. If we wish to estimate what the temperature of the Earth would be if it had no atmosphere, then we could take the albedo and emissivity of the Moon as a good estimate. The albedo and emissivity of the Moon are about 0.1054&lt;ref name="Saari"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saari |first1=J. M. |last2=Shorthill |first2= R. W.|year=1972 |title=The Sunlit Lunar Surface. I.

Estimates of the Earth's average albedo vary in the range 0.3–0.4, resulting in different estimated effective temperatures. Estimates are often based on the [[solar constant]] (total insolation power density) rather than the temperature, size, and distance of the Sun. For example, using 0.4 for albedo, and an insolation of 1400 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, one obtains an effective temperature of about 245 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Cosmology==

The [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation observed today is the most perfect black-body radiation ever observed in nature, with a temperature of about 2.7&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite news |first1=M. |last1=White |year=1999 |title= Anisotropies in the CMB |arxiv= astro-ph/9903232 |bibcode = 1999dpf..conf.....W }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a "snapshot" of the radiation at the time of [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]] between matter and radiation in the early universe. Prior to this time, most matter in the universe was in the form of an ionized plasma in thermal, though not full thermodynamic, equilibrium with radiation.

According to Kondepudi and Prigogine, at very high temperatures (above 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K; such temperatures existed in the very early universe), where the thermal motion separates protons and neutrons in spite of the strong nuclear forces, electron-positron pairs appear and disappear spontaneously and are in thermal equilibrium with electromagnetic radiation. These particles form a part of the black body spectrum, in addition to the electromagnetic radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kondepudi|Prigogine|1998|pages = 227–228}}; also Section 11.6, pages 294–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doppler effect for a moving black body==

The [[relativistic Doppler effect]] causes a shift in the frequency ''f'' of light originating from a source that is moving in relation to the observer, so that the wave is observed to have frequency ''f''':
:&lt;math&gt;f' = f \frac{1 - \frac{v}{c} \cos \theta}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''v'' is the velocity of the source in the observer's rest frame, ''θ'' is the angle between the velocity vector and the observer-source direction measured in the reference frame of the source, and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;The Doppler Effect, T. P. Gill, Logos Press, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; This can be simplified for the special cases of objects moving directly towards (''θ'' = π) or away (''θ'' = 0) from the observer, and for speeds much less than ''c''.

Through Planck's law the temperature spectrum of a black body is proportionally related to the frequency of light and one may substitute the temperature (''T'') for the frequency in this equation.

For the case of a source moving directly towards or away from the observer, this reduces to
:&lt;math&gt;T' = T \sqrt{\frac{c-v}{c+v}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here ''v'' &gt; 0 indicates a receding source, and ''v'' &lt; 0 indicates an approaching source.

This is an important effect in astronomy, where the velocities of stars and galaxies can reach significant fractions of ''c''. An example is found in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], which exhibits a dipole anisotropy from the Earth's motion relative to this black-body radiation field.

==History==

===Balfour Stewart===

In 1858, [[Balfour Stewart]] described his experiments on the thermal radiative emissive and absorptive powers of polished plates of various substances, compared with the powers of lamp-black surfaces, at the same temperature.&lt;ref name="Stewart 1858"&gt;{{harvnb|Stewart|1858}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart chose lamp-black surfaces as his reference because of various previous experimental findings, especially those of [[Pierre Prevost]] and of [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]]. He wrote "Lamp-black, which absorbs all the rays that fall upon it, and therefore possesses the greatest possible absorbing power, will possess also the greatest possible radiating power." More an experimenter than a logician, Stewart failed to point out that his statement presupposed an abstract general principle, that there exist either ideally in theory or really in nature bodies or surfaces that respectively have one and the same unique universal greatest possible absorbing power, likewise for radiating power, for every wavelength and equilibrium temperature. 

Stewart measured radiated power with a thermo-pile and sensitive galvanometer read with a microscope. He was concerned with selective thermal radiation, which he investigated with plates of substances that radiated and absorbed selectively for different qualities of radiation rather than maximally for all qualities of radiation. He discussed the experiments in terms of rays which could be reflected and refracted, and which obeyed the Stokes-[[Helmholtz reciprocity]] principle (though he did not use an eponym for it). He did not in this paper mention that the qualities of the rays might be described by their wavelengths, nor did he use spectrally resolving apparatus such as prisms or diffraction gratings. His work was quantitative within these constraints. He made his measurements in a room temperature environment, and quickly so as to catch his bodies in a condition near the thermal equilibrium in which they had been prepared by heating to equilibrium with boiling water. His measurements confirmed that substances that emit and absorb selectively respect the principle of selective equality of emission and absorption at thermal equilibrium.

Stewart offered a theoretical proof that this should be the case separately for every selected quality of thermal radiation, but his mathematics was not rigorously valid.&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;{{harvnb|Siegel|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made no mention of thermodynamics in this paper, though he did refer to conservation of ''[[vis viva]]''. He proposed that his measurements implied that radiation was both absorbed and emitted by particles of matter throughout depths of the media in which it propagated. He applied the Helmholtz reciprocity principle to account for the material interface processes as distinct from the processes in the interior material. He did not postulate unrealizable perfectly black surfaces. He concluded that his experiments showed that in a cavity in thermal equilibrium, the heat radiated from any part of the interior bounding surface, no matter of what material it might be composed, was the same as would have been emitted from a surface of the same shape and position that would have been composed of lamp-black. He did not state explicitly that the lamp-black-coated bodies that he used as reference must have had a unique common spectral emittance function that depended on temperature in a unique way.

===Gustav Kirchhoff===

In 1859, not knowing of Stewart's work, [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Gustav Robert Kirchhoff]] reported the coincidence of the wavelengths of spectrally resolved lines of absorption and of emission of visible light. Importantly for thermal physics, he also observed that bright lines or dark lines were apparent depending on the temperature difference between emitter and absorber.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchhoff then went on to consider some bodies that emit and absorb heat radiation, in an opaque enclosure or cavity, in equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}}.

Here is used a notation different from Kirchhoff's. Here, the emitting power {{math|''E''(''T'', ''i'')}} denotes a dimensioned quantity, the total radiation emitted by a body labeled by index {{math|''i''}} at temperature {{math|''T''}}. The total absorption ratio {{math|''a''(''T'', ''i'')}} of that body is dimensionless, the ratio of absorbed to incident radiation in the cavity at temperature {{math|''T''}} . (In contrast with Balfour Stewart's, Kirchhoff's definition of his absorption ratio did not refer in particular to a lamp-black surface as the source of the incident radiation.) Thus the ratio {{math|''E''(''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''T'', ''i'')}} of emitting power to absorption ratio is a dimensioned quantity, with the dimensions of emitting power, because {{math|''a''(''T'', ''i'')}} is dimensionless. Also here the wavelength-specific emitting power of the body at temperature {{math|''T''}} is denoted by {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} and the wavelength-specific absorption ratio by {{math|''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} . Again, the ratio {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} of emitting power to absorption ratio is a dimensioned quantity, with the dimensions of emitting power.

In a second report made in 1859, Kirchhoff announced a new general principle or law for which he offered a theoretical and mathematical proof, though he did not offer quantitative measurements of radiation powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860b}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schirrmacher 2001"&gt;{{harvnb|Schirrmacher|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; His principle, however, has endured: it was that for heat rays of the same wavelength, in equilibrium at a given temperature, the wavelength-specific ratio of emitting power to absorption ratio has one and the same common value for all bodies that emit and absorb at that wavelength. In symbols, the law stated that the wavelength-specific ratio {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} has one and the same value for all bodies, that is for all values of index {{math|''i''}} . In this report there was no mention of black bodies.

In 1860, still not knowing of Stewart's measurements for selected qualities of radiation, Kirchhoff pointed out that it was long established experimentally that for total heat radiation, of unselected quality, emitted and absorbed by a body in equilibrium, the dimensioned total radiation ratio {{math|''E''(''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''T'', ''i'')}}, has one and the same value common to all bodies, that is, for every value of the material index {{math|''i''}}.&lt;ref name="Kirchhoff 1860c"&gt;{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again without measurements of radiative powers or other new experimental data, Kirchhoff then offered a fresh theoretical proof of his new principle of the universality of the value of the wavelength-specific ratio {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} at thermal equilibrium. His fresh theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schirrmacher 2001"/&gt;

But more importantly, it relied on a new theoretical postulate of "perfectly black bodies," which is the reason why one speaks of Kirchhoff's law. Such black bodies showed complete absorption in their infinitely thin most superficial surface. They correspond to Balfour Stewart's reference bodies, with internal radiation, coated with lamp-black. They were not the more realistic perfectly black bodies later considered by Planck. Planck's black bodies radiated and absorbed only by the material in their interiors; their interfaces with contiguous media were only mathematical surfaces, capable neither of absorption nor emission, but only of reflecting and transmitting with refraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchhoff's proof considered an arbitrary non-ideal body labeled {{math|''i''}} as well as various perfect black bodies labeled {{math|BB}} . It required that the bodies be kept in a cavity in thermal equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}} . His proof intended to show that the ratio {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} was independent of the nature {{math|''i''}} of the non-ideal body, however partly transparent or partly reflective it was.

His proof first argued that for wavelength {{math|''λ''}} and at temperature {{math|''T''}}, at thermal equilibrium, all perfectly black bodies of the same size and shape have the one and the same common value of emissive power {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)}}, with the dimensions of power. His proof noted that the dimensionless wavelength-specific absorption ratio {{math|''a''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)}} of a perfectly black body is by definition exactly 1. Then for a perfectly black body, the wavelength-specific ratio of emissive power to absorption ratio {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', BB) / ''a''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)}} is again just {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)}}, with the dimensions of power. Kirchhoff considered, successively, thermal equilibrium with the arbitrary non-ideal body, and with a perfectly black body of the same size and shape, in place in his cavity in equilibrium at temperature {{math|''T''}} . He argued that the flows of heat radiation must be the same in each case. Thus he argued that at thermal equilibrium the ratio {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'') / ''a''(''λ'', ''T'', ''i'')}} was equal to {{math|''E''(''λ'', ''T'', BB)}}, which may now be denoted {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; (''λ'', ''T'')}}, a continuous function, dependent only on {{math|''λ''}} at fixed temperature {{math|''T''}}, and an increasing function of {{math|''T''}} at fixed wavelength {{math|''λ''}}, at low temperatures vanishing for visible but not for longer wavelengths, with positive values for visible wavelengths at higher temperatures, which does not depend on the nature {{math|''i''}} of the arbitrary non-ideal body. (Geometrical factors, taken into detailed account by Kirchhoff, have been ignored in the foregoing.)

Thus [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]] can be stated: ''For any material at all, radiating and absorbing in thermodynamic equilibrium at any given temperature {{math|T}}, for every wavelength {{math|λ}}, the ratio of emissive power to absorptive ratio has one universal value, which is characteristic of a perfect black body, and is an emissive power which we here represent by {{math|B&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; (λ, T)}} .'' (For our notation {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; (''λ'', ''T'')}}, Kirchhoff's original notation was simply {{math|''e''}}.)&lt;ref name="Kirchhoff 1860c"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1950|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|1930|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rybicki|Lightman|1979|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mihalas|Weibel-Mihalas|1984|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goody|Yung|1989|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchhoff announced that the determination of the function {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; (''λ'', ''T'')}} was a problem of the highest importance, though he recognized that there would be experimental difficulties to be overcome. He supposed that like other functions that do not depend on the properties of individual bodies, it would be a simple function. Occasionally by historians that function {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; (''λ'', ''T'')}} has been called "Kirchhoff's (emission, universal) function,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Paschen|Paschen, F.]] (1896), personal letter cited by {{harvnb|Hermann|1971|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hermann|1971|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1978|pages=8, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mehra and Rechenberg|1982|pages=26, 28, 31, 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; though its precise mathematical form would not be known for another forty years, till it was discovered by Planck in 1900. The theoretical proof for Kirchhoff's universality principle was worked on and debated by various physicists over the same time, and later.&lt;ref name="Schirrmacher 2001"/&gt; Kirchhoff stated later in 1860 that his theoretical proof was better than Balfour Stewart's, and in some respects it was so.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt; Kirchhoff's 1860 paper did not mention the second law of thermodynamics, and of course did not mention the concept of entropy which had not at that time been established. In a more considered account in a book in 1862, Kirchhoff mentioned the connection of his law with [[Carnot's principle]], which is a form of the second law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1862/1882|page=573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Helge Kragh, "Quantum theory owes its origin to the study of thermal radiation, in particular to the "black-body" radiation that Robert Kirchhoff had first defined in 1859–1860."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kragh|1999|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Descartes}}
'''Cartesian doubt''' is a form of '''methodological skepticism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; associated with the writings and methodology of [[René Descartes]] (1596{{ndash}}1650).&lt;ref name="Philosophical Glossary"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20010621215141/http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?Cartesian+doubt A Philosophical Glossary]" edited by Justin Leiber, Philosophy Department, University of Houston, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt; Cartesian doubt is also known as '''Cartesian skepticism''', '''methodic doubt''', '''methodological skepticism''', '''universal doubt''', '''systematic doubt''' or '''hyperbolic doubt'''.

Cartesian doubt is a systematic process of being skeptical about (or doubting) the truth of one's beliefs, which has become a characteristic method in [[philosophy]]. This method of doubt was largely popularized in Western philosophy by René Descartes, who sought to doubt the truth of all his beliefs in order to determine which beliefs he could be certain were true. It is the basis for Descartes' statement, "''[[Cogito ergo sum]]''" ("I think, therefore I am").

Methodological skepticism is distinguished from [[philosophical skepticism]] in that methodological skepticism is an approach that subjects all knowledge claims to scrutiny with the goal of sorting out true from false claims, whereas philosophical skepticism is an approach that questions the possibility of certain knowledge.

== Characteristics ==
Cartesian doubt is methodological. Its purpose is to use doubt as a route to certain knowledge by finding those things which could not be doubted. The fallibility of sense data in particular is a subject of Cartesian doubt.

There are several interpretations as to the objective of Descartes' skepticism. Prominent among these is a [[W:foundationalism|foundationalist]] account which claims that Descartes' skepticism is aimed at eliminating all belief which it is possible to doubt, thus leaving Descartes with only [[basic belief]]s (also known as foundational beliefs). From these indubitable basic beliefs, Descartes then attempts to derive further knowledge. It's an archetypal and significant example that epitomizes the [[Rationalism|Continental Rational]] schools of philosophy.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

== Technique ==
Descartes' method of hyperbolic doubt included:
# accepting only information you know to be true
# breaking down these truths into smaller units
# solving the simple problems first
# making ''complete'' lists of further ''problems''

Hyperbolic doubt means having the tendency to doubt, since it is an extreme or exaggerated form of doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Skirry (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; (Knowledge in the Cartesian sense means to know something beyond not merely all reasonable, but all possible, doubt.) In his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' (1641), Descartes resolved to systematically doubt that any of his beliefs were true, in order to build, from the ground up, a belief system consisting of only certainly true beliefs; his end goal—or a major one, at the least—was to find an undoubtable basis for the sciences. Consider Descartes' opening lines of the ''Meditations'':

{{Quotation | Several years have now elapsed since I first became aware that I had accepted, even from my youth, many false opinions for true, and that consequently what I afterward based on such principles was highly doubtful; and from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking once in my life to rid myself of all the opinions I had adopted, and of commencing anew the work of building from the foundation... | René Descartes | Meditation I'', 1641}}

== Descartes's method ==
René Descartes, the originator of Cartesian doubt, put all beliefs, ideas, thoughts, and matter in doubt. He showed that his grounds, or reasoning, for any knowledge could just as well be false. Sensory experience, the primary mode of knowledge, is often erroneous and therefore must be doubted. For instance, what one is seeing may very well be a [[hallucination]]. There is nothing that proves it cannot be. In short, if there is any way a belief can be disproved, then its grounds are insufficient. From this, Descartes proposed two arguments, the dream and the demon.&lt;ref name="Scruton"&gt;[[Roger Scruton]]. ''Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey''. London: Penguin Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The dream argument ===
{{See also|Dream argument}}

Descartes, knowing that the context of our dreams, while possibly unbelievable, are often lifelike, hypothesized that humans can only believe that they are awake. There are no sufficient grounds by which to distinguish a dream experience from a waking experience. For instance, Subject A sits at the computer, typing this article. Just as much evidence exists to indicate that the act of composing this article is reality as there is evidence to demonstrate the opposite. Descartes conceded that we live in a world that can create such ideas as dreams. However, by the end of ''The Meditations'', he concludes that we can distinguish dream from reality at least in retrospect:&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"But when I distinctly see where things come from and where and when they come to me, and when I can connect my perceptions of them with my whole life without a break then I can be certain that when I encounter these things  I am not asleep but awake." &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;— Descartes: Selected Philosophical Writings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tNxSphqAYkC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=%22But+when+I+distinctly+see+where+things+come+from+and%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5_iRLDxEc-&amp;sig=4qw-RoWL9GPSHQvlI4cgzBEC1pw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjIkbHR9o_dAhUBUK0KHf07DMcQ6AEwAnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22But%20when%20I%20distinctly%20see%20where%20things%20come%20from%20and%22&amp;f=false|title=Descartes: Selected Philosophical Writings|last=Descartes|first=René|date=1988-02-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521358125|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Evil Demon ===

{{Main|Evil demon}}

Descartes reasoned that our very own experience may very well be controlled by an ''evil demon'' of sorts. This demon is as clever and deceitful as he is powerful. He could have created a superficial world that we may think we live in.&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt; As a result of this doubt, sometimes termed the Malicious Demon Hypothesis, Descartes found that he was unable to trust even the simplest of his perceptions.

In ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy#Meditation I: Concerning Those Things That Can Be Called into Doubt|Meditation I]]'', Descartes stated that if one were mad, even briefly, the insanity might have driven  man into believing that what we thought was true could be merely our minds deceiving us. He also stated that there could be '[[evil demon|some malicious, powerful, cunning demon]]' that had deceived us, preventing us from judging correctly.

Descartes argued that all his senses were lying and since your senses can easily fool you, his idea of an infinitely powerful being must be true as that idea could have only been put there by an infinitely powerful being which would have no reason to be deceitful to him.

== I think, therefore I am ==

While methodic doubt has a nature, one need not hold that knowledge is impossible in order to apply the method of doubt.  Indeed, Descartes' attempt to apply the method of doubt to the existence of himself spawned the proof of his famous saying, "''[[Cogito, ergo sum]]''" (I think, therefore I am).  That is, Descartes tried to doubt his own existence, but found that even his doubting showed that he existed, since he could not doubt if he did not exist.&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6356">The '''Centre of Research in Theories and Practices that Overcome Inequalities''' ('''CREA''') was founded in 1991 by a current professor of [[Sociology]] at the [[University of Barcelona]], [[Doctor Honoris Causa]] of [[West University of Timisoara]] and also a recognized researcher in [[Europe]] in the [[Social Science]] area, [[Ramon Flecha]]. After Ramon Flecha’s resignation as the Director of CREA, in 2006; Marta Soler, Doctor by Harvard, a current Professor of Sociological Theory, assumed the post. 
CREA, one of the centres that first joined the Scientific Park of Barcelona (University of Barcelona); is indisciplinary;  [[multicultural]]  and open accepting different [[ideology|ideologies]], [[religion]]s, [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]], [[sexual orientation]]s ; transparent, since its knowledge is at everyone’s disposal; and it is a centre where the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of [[argument]]s prevails over the positions of power of their members, creating, in this way, an environment of an [[egalitarian dialogue]]. This centre is formed by University [[research]] professors, researchers and professional collaborators of diverse disciplines (sociology, pedagogy, economy, mathematics, communication, biology, etc.).

==Methodology==
All the [[research]] CREA carries out is done with the direct collaboration of the subjects researched, using the [[critical communicative methodology]]. The subject of research is directly included providing its interpretations, experiences and opinions, enriching, in this way, the research. It is about facilitating the participation of the researched in the research through an [[egalitarian dialogue]] with the researcher where [[Validity (logic)|validity]] claims prevail over [[Power (philosophy)|power]] ones.

==Lines of research==
The [[Research]] Centre carries out both, international and national projects developing the following lines of research:

* [[Dialogic]] Theories (including the Critical Communicative Research [[Methodology]] and [[Speech]] Acts, [[Social]] uses of the information and [[Communication]] technologies).
* [[Cultural]] Groups ([[Romani people|Roma]], [[Arab]]- [[Muslim]] and [[Jewish community]]) and [[human migration|migration]]
* [[Learning]] Communities
* [[Gender]] (Gender [[Violence]])
* [[Governance]] and Active [[Citizenship]]

==Groups==
And from the lines of research described above, five groups were created by CREA:
*	[[Romani people|Roma]] Studies Group
*	[[Jewish Studies]] Group
*	Alhiwar [[Arab]]-[[Muslim]] Group
*	Interreligious [[Dialogue]]
*	SAFO CREA [[Women]]’s Group

==International dimension==
CREA is, today, internationally well- known for its international research oriented to overcoming inequalities; already present in Europe and in various countries such as [[Brazil]], [[United States]], [[Korea]] or [[Australia]].
Concretely, from its origins, CREA has collaborated with international research groups, as well as with different authors of the Scientific International Community. Some of the seminars were held with important authors such as: [[Paulo Freire]] (1994), [[Ulrich Beck]] and Elisabeth Beck Gernsheim(1998), [[Alain Touraine]] (1999), [[Jon Elster]] (2001), [[Judith Butler]] ( 2001), [[Alejandro Portes]] (2002), Gordon Wells(2003), [[John Searle]] (2003) or [[Gary Orfield]] (2003).

Different members of CREA have given lectures and seminars at several universities in [[Brazil]], [[United States]], [[Germany]], Australia, [[Korea]] and others. [[Ramon Flecha]] participated in The [[Harvard]] Education Forum celebrated on February 27, 1998; in honor of [[Paulo Freire]], alongside important international referents such as: [[Noam Chomsky]] (Institute Professor and Professor of Linguistics, [[MIT]]), Eileen de los Reyes (Moderator, Assistant Professor [[Harvard Graduate School of Education|HGSE]]), Carolyn Higgins (Earlhm College), Yamila Hussein ([[Harvard Graduate School of Education|HGSE]] master’s degree candidate), [[Donaldo Macedo]] ([[UMass Boston]]), Nancy Richardson (associate dean for ministry, [[Harvard Divinity School]]), [[Ira Shor]] ([[City College of New York]]).

In addition, and as another example, in 2008, professor of Sociological Theory and director of CREA, Marta Soler, gave two lectures about literary gatherings and Community involvement for [[social change]]  and about the role of critical communicative methodology in Overcoming [[social exclusion]] ; and led a seminar at the Havens Center for Study of Social of Structure and Social Change, in the [[University of Wisconsin- Madison]].

{{no footnotes|date=November 2017}}
The '''cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence''' ('''CAPS''') method is a technique in [[molecular biology]] for the analysis of [[genetic marker]]s. It is an extension to the [[Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism]] (RFLP) method, using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) to more quickly analyse the results.

Like RFLP, CAPS works on the principle that genetic differences between individuals can create or abolish [[restriction endonuclease]] restriction sites, and that these differences can be detected in the resulting DNA fragment length after digestion. 

In the CAPS method, PCR amplification is directed across the altered restriction site, and the products digested with the restriction enzyme. When fractionated by [[agarose]] or [[acrylamide]] [[gel electrophoresis]], the digested PCR products will give readily distinguishable patterns of bands. Alternatively, the amplified segment can be analyzed by [[allele-specific oligonucleotide]] (ASO) probes, a process that can often be done by a simple [[dot blot]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3412">'''Distance decay''' is a [[Human geography|geographical]] term which describes the effect of [[distance]] on cultural or spatial [[interaction]]s.  The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.

With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-[[abandoned railway]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in [[communications technology]], such as telegraphs, telephones, [[broadcasting]], and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692313000653 | doi=10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2013.04.001 | volume=31 | title=Boots are made for walking: interactions across physical and social space in infrastructure-poor regions | year=2013 | journal=Journal of Transport Geography | pages=226–235 | author=Matous Petr, Todo Yasuyuki, Mojo Dagne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distance decay is graphically represented by a curving line that swoops [[convex function|concavely]] downward as distance along the x-axis increases.  Distance decay can be mathematically represented as an [[Inverse-square law]] by the expression

&lt;math&gt;I = const. \times d^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; 
or
&lt;math&gt;I \propto 1/d^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where I is interaction and d is distance. It can take other forms such as [[Exponential decay|negative exponential]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nekola J. C., White P. S. | year = 1999 | title = The distance decay of similarity in biogeography and ecology | url = http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Peet/ecoinfo/distance_decay/nekolapeter.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Biogeography | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 867–878 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00305.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e.

&lt;math&gt;I \propto e^{-d}&lt;/math&gt;
.

Distance decay is evident in town/[[city centre]]s. It can refer to various things which decline with greater distance from the center of the [[Central Business District]] (CBD):
* density of [[pedestrian]] traffic
* street quality 
* quality of shops (depending on definitions of 'quality' and 'center')
* height of buildings 
* [[bid rent theory|price of land]]

Distance decay weighs into the decision to migrate, leading many [[Human migration|migrants]] to move less far.

== Related concepts ==

Related terms include "[[friction of distance]]", which describes the force that creates distance decay and [[Waldo R. Tobler]]'s "[[Tobler's first law of geography|First law of geography]]", an informal statement that "All things are related, but near things are more related than far things." 
"[[Loss of Strength Gradient]]" holds that the amount of a nation's military power that could be brought to bear in any part of the world depends on geographic distance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1197">'''Ecosharing''' is an environmental ethic for people to live by: that their own impact on the Earth’s [[biosphere]] be limited to no more than their own fair ecoshare. The term seems to have been first used by G. Tyler Miller, Jr. in the 1975 edition of his ''Living in the Environment'' text.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Jr., G. Tyler ''Living in the Environment'' CA: Wadsworth Publishing Co, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990 book ''Coming of Age in the Global Village'' sought to quantify an "ecoshare" by linking it to average world per capita income and energy use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectworldview.org/comingofage.htm Cook, Stephen P. and Meadows, Donella H. ''Coming of Age in the Global Village'' AR: Parthenon Books, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; A more modern approach might extend this by also including one's [[carbon footprint]]. However it is gauged, an ecoshare is determined by overall assessment of the human impact on the biosphere, computer models of its future condition, and necessary limits imposed by [[sustainability]] criteria.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5849">[[File:Elements of art.jpg|thumb|right|Elements of art and design]]
A work of art can be analyzed by considering a variety of aspects of it individually. These aspects are often called the '''elements of art'''.  A commonly used list of the main elements include form, shape, line, color, value, space and texture.

== Point ==
[[File:Stars in orion constellation.jpg|thumb|right|Stars in a constellation are a natural example of using points in a composition]]
A point is basically the beginning of “something” in “nothing”. It forces the mind to think upon its position and gives something to build upon in both imagination and space. Some abstract points in a group can provoke human imagination to link it with familiar shapes or forms.

== Line ==
[[Line (geometry)|Lines]] and [[curve]]s are marks that span a distance between two points (or the path of a moving point). As an element of visual art, line is the use of various marks, outlines, and implied lines during  artwork and design. A line has a width, direction, and length.&lt;ref name="getty" /&gt; A line's width is most times called its "thickness". Lines are sometimes called "strokes", especially when referring to lines in digital artwork.
[[File:Stars in orion constellation (connected).jpg|thumb|right|Similarly stars in a constellation connected via imaginary lines are a natural example of using lines in a composition]]

== Shape ==
Shape refers to a 2-dimensional, enclosed area. Shapes could be geometric, such as squares, circles, triangles etc. or organic and curvaceous.

== Form ==
The form of a work is its shape, including its volume or perceived volume. A [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] artwork has depth as well as width and height. Three-dimensional form is the basis of [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name="getty"&gt;{{cite web|title = Understanding Formal Analysis|url = http://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/formal_analysis.html|publisher = Getty|accessdate = 9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] artwork can achieve the illusion of form with the use of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and/or [[shading]] or modelling techniques.&lt;ref name="incredible art"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elements and Principles of Design|url=http://www.incredibleart.org/files/elements2.htm|publisher=IncredibleArt.org|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are the Elements of Art?|url=http://arthistory.about.com/cs/reference/f/elements.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] is the analysis of works by their form or shapes in [[art history]] or [[archeology]].

== Color ==
[[Color]] is the element of art that is produced when light, striking an object, is reflected back to the eye.&lt;ref name="getty" /&gt; There are three properties to color. The first is [[hue]], which simply means the name we give to a color (red, yellow, blue, green, etc.). The second property is intensity, which refers to the vividness of the color. A color's intensity is sometimes referred to as its "[[colorfulness]]", its "saturation", its "purity" or its "strength".The third and final property of color is its [[Value (colorimetry)|value]], meaning how light or dark it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Value in Art? |url=http://arthistory.about.com/cs/glossaries/g/v_value.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The terms [[Tints and shades|shade and tint]] refer to value changes in colors. In painting, shades are created by adding black to a color, while tints are created by adding white to a color.&lt;ref name="incredible art" /&gt;

== Space ==
Space is any conducive  area that an artist provides for a particular purpose.&lt;ref name="getty"/&gt; Space includes the background, foreground and middle ground, and refers to the distances or area(s) around, between, and within things. There are two kinds of space: [[negative space]] and positive space.&lt;ref name="oberlin"&gt;{{cite web|title = Vocabulary: Elements of Art, Principles of Art|url = http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/asia/sculpture/documents/vocabulary.pdf|publisher = Oberlin|accessdate = 9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative space is the area in between, around, through or within an object. Positive spaces are the areas that are occupied by an object and/or form.

==Texture==
Texture, another element of art, is used to describe how something feels or looks. There are many forms of texture; the two main forms are actual and visual. 

Visual texture is strictly two-dimensional and is perceived by the eye that makes it seem like the texture.

Actual texture (tactile texture) is one not only visible, but can be felt. It rises above the surface transitioning it from two-dimensional to three-dimensional. 

Some Examples: Furry, Bumpy, Smooth, Rough, Soft, Hard... etc... 

== Value ==
Value is the degree of lightness and darkness in a color. The difference in values is called contrast. Value can relate to shades, where a color gets darker by adding black to it, or tints, where a color gets lighter by adding white to it. White is considered the lightest value whereas black is the darkest. The middle value between these extremes is also known as a half-tone, all of which can be found on a value scale. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedrawingsource.com/value-drawing.html|title=Value Drawing- The Key to Realism|last=Friedman|first=Marina|date=|website=The Drawing Source|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5154">{{Occupational hazards}}

'''Engineering controls''' are strategies designed to protect workers from [[Occupational hazard|hazardous conditions]] by placing a barrier between the worker and the hazard or by removing a hazardous substance through air [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/engcontrols/|title=NIOSH Directory of Engineering Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roelofs2007"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4lTEuFWtdIC&amp;pg=PA9|title=Preventing Hazards at the Source|first=Cora|date=1 January 2007|publisher=[[American Industrial Hygiene Association]]|year=|isbn=978-1-931504-83-6|location=|pages=9ff|author=Roelofs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Engineering controls involve a physical change to the workplace itself, rather than relying on workers' behavior or requiring workers to wear protective clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dte/grant_materials/fy10/sh-20839-10/hierarchy_of_controls.pdf|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineering controls is the third of five members of the [[hierarchy of hazard control]]s, which orders control strategies by their feasibility and effectiveness. Engineering controls are preferred over [[administrative controls]] and [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) because they are designed to remove the hazard at the source, before it comes in contact with the worker. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection. The initial cost of engineering controls can be higher than the cost of administrative controls or PPE, but over the longer term, operating costs are frequently lower, and in some instances, can provide a cost savings in other areas of the process.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/default.html|title=Hierarchy of Controls - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-30}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hazard elimination|Elimination]] and [[Hazard substitution|substitution]] are usually considered to be separate levels of hazard controls, but in some schemes they are categorized as types of engineering control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsaa.ca/effective-representation/hazard-identification-elimination-and-control|title=Hazard Identification, Elimination and Control|last=|first=|date=|website=Health Sciences Association of Alberta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314062833/https://www.hsaa.ca/effective-representation/hazard-identification-elimination-and-control|archive-date=2017-03-14|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://machinerysafety101.com/2011/02/28/understanding-the-hierarchy-of-controls/|title=Understanding the Hierarchy of Controls|last=Nix|first=Doug|date=2011-02-28|website=Machinery Safety 101|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30597">[[Image:Process and data modeling.svg|thumb|360px|Graphical representation of some types of models in enterprise modelling. A [[business model]] illustrates the functions associated with a process that are performance and the organizations that perform these functions. In software development often both [[business process model]]s and [[data model]]s are being developed as part of the process of creating application programs on the one side and [[database]]s on the other side.&lt;ref name="SS93"&gt;Paul R. Smith &amp; Richard Sarfaty (1993). [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/servlets/purl/10160331-YhIRrY/ Creating a strategic plan for configuration management using Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools.] Paper For 1993 National DOE/Contractors and Facilities CAD/CAE User's Group.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Enterprise modelling''' is the abstract representation, description and definition of the structure, processes, information and resources of an identifiable [[business]], [[government]] body, or other large organization.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius T. Leondes, Richard Henry Frymuth Jackson (1992). ''Manufacturing and Automation Systems: Techniques and Technologies''. Academic Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-12-012745-8}}, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

It deals with the process of understanding an organization and improving its performance through creation and analysis of enterprise models. This includes the modelling of the relevant business domain (usually relatively stable), [[business process modeling|business process]]es (usually more volatile), and uses of [[information technology]] within the business domain and its processes.

== Overview ==
Enterprise modelling is the process of building [[business model|model]]s of whole or part of an [[Business|enterprise]] with [[process model]]s, [[data model]]s, [[resource model]]s and or new [[ontologies]] etc. It is based on knowledge about the enterprise, previous models and/or [[reference model]]s as well as domain ontologies using model representation languages.&lt;ref name="Vern97"&gt;[[François Vernadat|F.B. Vernadat]] (1997). [http://www.mel.nist.gov/workshop/iceimt97/pap-ver3/pap-ver3.htm Enterprise Modelling Languages ICEIMT'97 Enterprise Integration - International Consensus]. EI-IC ESPRIT Project 21.859.&lt;/ref&gt; An enterprise in general is a unit of economic organization or activity. These activities are required to develop and deliver [[Product (business)|product]]s and/or [[Service (economics)|services]] to a customer. An enterprise includes a number of functions and operations such as purchasing, manufacturing, marketing, finance, engineering, and research and development. The enterprise of interest are those corporate functions and operations necessary to manufacture current and potential future variants of a product.&lt;ref name="Ostie96"&gt;James K. Ostie (1996). [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/432930-yXrz5I/webviewable/432930.PDF "An Introduction to Enterprise Modeling and Simulation"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "enterprise model" is used in industry to represent differing enterprise representations, with no real standardized definition.&lt;ref&gt;E. Aranow (1991). "Modeling Exercises Shape Up Enterprises". In: ''Software Magazine'' Vol.11, p. 36-43&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the complexity of enterprise organizations, a vast number of differing enterprise modelling approaches have been pursued across industry and academia.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Pétrie Jr. (1992). "Introduction", In: ''Enterprise Integration Modeling - Proceedings of the First International Conference'' MIT Press, p. 563.&lt;/ref&gt; Enterprise modelling constructs can focus upon manufacturing operations and/or business operations; however, a common thread in enterprise modelling is an inclusion of assessment of information technology. For example, the use of networked computers to trigger and receive replacement orders along a material supply chain is an example of how information technology is used to coordinate manufacturing operations within an enterprise.&lt;ref name="Ostie96"/&gt;

The basic idea of enterprise modelling according to [[Ulrich Frank]]&lt;ref name="FU09"&gt;[http://www.wi-inf.uni-due.de/FGFrank/index.php?lang=en&amp;&amp;groupId=1&amp;&amp;contentType=ResearchInterest&amp;&amp;topicId=14 "Enterprise modeling"] by [[Ulrich Frank]] (2009) at wi-inf.uni-due.de. Retrieved May 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is "to offer different [[View model|views]] on an enterprise, thereby providing a medium to foster dialogues between various [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] - both in academia and in practice. For this purpose they include abstractions suitable for [[strategic planning]], [[Business process reengineering|organisational (re-) design]] and [[software engineering]]. The views should complement each other and thereby foster a better understanding of [[complex system]]s by systematic abstractions. The views should be generic in the sense that they can be applied to any enterprise. At the same time they should offer abstractions that help with designing [[information systems]] which are well integrated with a company's long term strategy and its organisation. Hence, [[enterprise model]]s can be regarded as the conceptual infrastructure that support a high level of integration."&lt;ref name="FU09"/&gt;

== History ==
Enterprise modelling has its roots in [[systems modelling]] and especially information systems modelling. One of the earliest pioneering works in modelling information systems was done by Young and Kent (1958),&lt;ref&gt;Young, J. W., and Kent, H. K. (1958). "Abstract Formulation of Data Processing Problems". In: ''Journal of Industrial Engineering''. Nov-Dec 1958. 9(6), pp. 471-479&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JAB07"&gt;[[Janis A. Bubenko jr]] (2007) "From Information Algebra to Enterprise Modelling and Ontologies - a Historical Perspective on Modelling for Information Systems". In: ''Conceptual Modelling in Information Systems Engineering''. [[:w:John Krogstie|John Krogstie]] et al. eds. pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt; who argued for "a precise and abstract way of specifying the informational and time characteristics of a [[data processing]] problem". They wanted to create "a notation that should enable the [[Systems analyst|analyst]] to organize the problem around any piece of [[computer hardware|hardware]]". Their work was a first effort to create an abstract specification and invariant basis for designing different alternative implementations using different hardware components. A next step in IS modelling was taken by [[CODASYL]], an IT industry consortium formed in 1959, who essentially aimed at the same thing as Young and Kent: the development of "a proper structure for machine independent problem definition language, at the system level of data processing". This led to the development of a specific IS [[information algebra]].&lt;ref name="JAB07"/&gt;

The first methods dealing with enterprise modelling emerged in the 1970s. They were the [[Entity-relationship model|entity-relationship approach]] of [[Peter Chen]] (1976) and [[SADT]] of [[Douglas T. Ross]] (1977), the one concentrate on the [[information view]] and the other on the [[function view]] of business entities.&lt;ref name="Vern97"/&gt; These first methods have been followed end 1970s by numerous methods for [[software engineering]], such as [[SSADM]], [[Structured Design]], [[Structured Analysis]] and others. Specific methods for enterprise modelling in the context of [[Computer Integrated Manufacturing]] appeared in the early 1980s. They include the [[IDEF]] family of methods (ICAM, 1981) and the [[GRAI method]] by [[Guy Doumeingts]] in 1984&lt;ref&gt;[[Doumeingts, Guy]] (1984) ''La Méthode GRAI''. PhD. Thesis, University of Bordeaux I, Bordeaux, France. (In French).&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[GRAI/GIM]] by Doumeingts and others in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Doumeingts|Doumeingts, G.]], [[Bruno Vallespir|Vallespir, B.]], Zanettin, M. and Chen, D. (1992) ''GIM, GRAI Integrated Methodology - A methodology for Designing CIM systems, Version 1.0''. Unnumbered Report, LAP/GRAI, University of Bordeaux I, France&lt;/ref&gt;

These second generation of methods were activity-based methods which have been surpassed on the one hand by process-centred modelling methods developed in the 1990s such as [[Architecture of Integrated Information Systems]] (ARIS), [[CIMOSA]] and [[Integrated Enterprise Modeling]] (IEM). And on the other hand by [[Object-Oriented Modeling|object-oriented methods]], such as [[Object-oriented analysis and design|Object-oriented analysis]] (OOA) and [[Object-modeling technique|Object-modelling technique]] (OMT).&lt;ref name="Vern97"/&gt;

== Enterprise modelling basics ==
=== Enterprise model ===
An enterprise model is a representation of the structure, activities, processes, information, resources, people, behavior, goals, and constraints of a business, government, or other enterprises.&lt;ref name="FG98"&gt;[[Mark S. Fox]] and [[Michael Gruninger]] (1998) "[http://www.eil.utoronto.ca/enterprise-modelling/papers/fox-aimag98.pdf Enterprise Modeling]". American Association for Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Naylor]] (1970) defined a (simulation) model as "an attempt to describe the interrelationships among a corporation's financial, marketing, and production activities in terms of a set of mathematical and logical relationships which are programmed into the computer."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Naylor|Naylor, T.]] (1970) Corporate simulation models and the economic theory of the firm, in Schrieber, A. (editor) "Corporate simulation models", University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1970, pp 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt; These interrelationships should according to Gershefski (1971) represent in detail all aspects of the firm including "the physical operations of the company, the accounting and financial practices followed, and the response to investment in key areas"&lt;ref&gt;Gershefski, G. (1971) "What's happening in the world of corporate models?", Interfaces, Vol 1, No 4. p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Programming the modelled relationships into the computer is not always necessary: enterprise models, under different names, have existed for centuries and were described, for example, by Adam Smith, Walter Bagehot, and many others.

According to Fox and [[Michael Gruninger|Gruninger]] (1998) from "a design perspective, an enterprise model should provide the language used to explicitly define an enterprise... From an operations perspective, the enterprise model must be able to represent what is planned, what might happen, and what has happened. It must supply the information and knowledge necessary to support the operations of the enterprise, whether they be performed by hand or machine."&lt;ref name="FG98"/&gt;

In a two-volume set entitled ''The Managerial Cybernetics of Organization'' Stafford Beer introduced a model of the enterprise, the Viable System Model (VSM). Volume 2, ''The Heart of Enterprise,''&lt;ref name="MCO2"&gt;Beer, Stafford. (1979) ''The Heart of Enterprise,'' Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the VSM as a recursive organization of five systems: System One (S1) through System Five (S5). Beer's model differs from others in that the VSM is recursive, not hierarchical: "In a recursive organizational structure, any viable system contains, and is contained in, a viable system."&lt;ref name="MCO2"/&gt;

=== Function modelling ===
[[Image:IDEF Diagram Example.jpg|thumb|320px|Example of a function model of the process of "Maintain Reparable Spares" in [[IDEF0]] notation.]]
[[Function model]]ling in systems engineering is a structured representation of the [[Function (engineering)|functions]], activities or [[Process modeling|process]]es within the modelled [[system]] or subject area.&lt;ref name= "ITL93"&gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/idef02.doc FIPS Publication 183] released of IDEFØ December 1993 by the Computer Systems Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&lt;/ref&gt;

A function model, also called an [[activity diagram|activity model]] or [[process model]], is a graphical representation of an [[Business|enterprise]]'s function within a defined scope. The purpose of the function model are to describe the functions and processes, assist with discovery of information needs, help identify opportunities, and establish a basis for determining product and service costs.&lt;ref name="rmsc-1995"&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/era/pdf/rmsc-19951006-dod-rm-function-and-information-models.pdf Reader's Guide to IDEF0 Function Models]. Accessed 27 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A function model is created with a functional [[Modeling perspectives|modelling perspective]]. A functional perspectives is one or more perspectives possible in process modelling. Other perspectives possible are for example behavioural, organisational or informational.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.jyu.fi/~jpt/ME2000/Me14/sld004.htm Process perspectives]. In: ''Metamodeling and method engineering'', Minna Koskinen, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A functional modelling perspective concentrates on describing the [[dynamic system|dynamic process]]. The main concept in this modelling perspective is the process, this could be a function, transformation, activity, action, task etc. A well-known example of a modelling language employing this perspective is [[data flow diagram]]s. The perspective uses four symbols to describe a process, these being:
*Process: Illustrates transformation from input to output.
*Store:	   Data-collection or some sort of material.
*Flow:	   Movement of data or material in the process.
*External Entity: External to the modelled system, but interacts with it.
Now, with these symbols, a process can be represented as a network of these symbols. This decomposed process is a DFD, data flow diagram. In [[Dynamic Enterprise Modeling]], for example, a division is made in the [[Control model]], Function Model, [[Process model]] and [[Organizational model]].

=== Data modelling ===
[[Image:4-3 Data Modelling Today.svg|240px|thumb|left|The [[data modeling|data modelling]] process.]] 
[[Data modeling|Data modelling]] is the process of creating a [[data model]] by applying formal data model descriptions using data modelling techniques. Data modelling is a technique for defining business [[requirement]]s for a [[database]]. It is sometimes called ''database modelling'' because a [[data model]] is eventually implemented in a database.&lt;ref name= "WBD04"&gt;[[Whitten, Jeffrey L.]]; [[Lonnie D. Bentley]], [[Kevin C. Dittman]]. (2004). ''Systems Analysis and Design Methods''. 6th edition. {{ISBN|0-256-19906-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure illustrates the way data models are developed and used today. A [[conceptual data model]] is developed based on the data requirements for the application that is being developed, perhaps in the context of an [[activity diagram|activity model]]. The data model will normally consist of entity types, attributes, relationships, integrity rules, and the definitions of those objects. This is then used as the start point for interface or database design.&lt;ref name="MW99"&gt;Matthew West and Julian Fowler (1999). [http://www.matthew-west.org.uk/documents/princ03.pdf Developing High Quality Data Models] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221084613/http://www.matthew-west.org.uk/documents/princ03.pdf |date=2008-12-21 }}. The European Process Industries STEP Technical Liaison Executive (EPISTLE).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business process modelling ===
[[Image:BPMN-AProcesswithNormalFlow.svg|thumb|320px|Example of [[business process modeling|business process modelling]] with [[Business Process Model and Notation]].]]

[[Business process modeling|Business process modelling]], not to be confused with the wider [[Business process management|Business Process Management]] (BPM) discipline, is the activity of [[process modeling|representing processes]] of an enterprise, so that the current ("as is") process may be analyzed and improved in future ("to be"). Business process modelling is typically performed by business analysts and managers who are seeking to improve process efficiency and quality. The process improvements identified by business process modelling may or may not require [[Information Technology]] involvement, although that is a common driver for the need to model a business process, by creating a process master.

[[Change management]] programs are typically involved to put the improved business processes into practice. With advances in technology from large platform vendors, the vision of business process modelling models becoming fully executable (and capable of simulations and round-trip engineering) is coming closer to reality every day.

=== Systems architecture ===
The [[RM-ODP]] reference model identifies enterprise modelling as providing one of the five viewpoints of an open distributed system. Note that such a system need not be a modern-day IT system: a banking clearing house in the 19th century may be used as an example (&lt;ref&gt;Haim Kilov. ''Business models - A Guide for Business and IT.'' Prentice-Hall, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Enterprise modelling techniques ==
There are several techniques for modelling the enterprise such as 
* Active Knowledge Modeling,&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lillehagen, [[John Krogstie]] (2008). ''Active Knowledge Modeling of Enterprises''. Springer, 2008. {{ISBN|3-540-79415-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Design &amp; Engineering Methodology for Organizations]] (DEMO)
* [[Dynamic Enterprise Modeling]]
* [[Enterprise Modelling Methodology/Open Distributed Processing]] (EMM/ODP)
* [[Extended Enterprise Modeling Language]]
* Multi-Perspective Enterprise Modelling (MEMO),&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulrich Frank]] (2002). "[http://www.wi-inf.uni-essen.de/FGFrank/documents/Konferenzbeitraege/HICSS2002.pdf Multi-Perspective Enterprise Modeling (MEMO): Conceptual Framework and Modeling Languages]". In: ''Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS-35). Los Alamitos, CA.'' Ralph H. Sprague, Jr. (eds.). IEEE Computer Society Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Process modelling such as [[Business Process Model and Notation|BPMN]], [[CIMOSA]], [[DYA framework|DYA]], [[IDEF3]], LOVEM, [[Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture|PERA]], etc.
* [[Integrated Enterprise Modeling]] (IEM), and
* Modelling the enterprise with [[multi-agent systems]].

More enterprise modelling techniques are developed into [[Enterprise Architecture framework]] such as:
* [[Architecture of Integrated Information Systems|ARIS]] - ARchitecture of Integrated Information Systems
* [[DoDAF]] - the US Department of Defense Architecture Framework
* [[RM-ODP]] - Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing
* [[TOGAF]] - The [[Open Group]] Architecture Framework
* [[Zachman Framework]] - an architecture framework, based on the work of [[John Zachman]] at IBM in the 1980s
* [[service-oriented modeling#Service-oriented modeling framework|Service-oriented modeling framework (SOMF)]], based on the work of [[Michael B.T. Bell|Michael Bell]]
And metamodelling frameworks such as:
* [[Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology]]

== Enterprise engineering ==
[[Enterprise engineering]] is the discipline concerning the design and the engineering of [[Business|enterprises]], regarding both their [[business process|business]] and [[organization]].&lt;ref name="Die06"&gt;[[Jan Dietz]] (2006). ''Enterprise Ontology - Theory and Methodology''. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory and practice two types of enterprise engineering has emerged. A more general connected to engineering and the management of enterprises, and a more specific related to software engineering, enterprise modelling and enterprise architecture.

In the field of [[engineering]] a more general enterprise engineering emerged, defined&lt;ref name="Pil08"&gt;[http://personal.rhul.ac.uk/uhtm/001/homepage.html Enterprise Engineering Research at Royal Holloway] led by Dr [[Alan Pilkington]], Ver 9.08. Accessed 4 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; as the application of [[engineering]] principals to the [[management]] of [[Company|enterprises]]. It encompasses the application of  knowledge, principles, and disciplines related to the analysis, design, implementation and operation of all elements associated with an enterprise. In essence this is an [[interdisciplinary field]] which combines [[systems engineering]] and [[strategic management]] as it seeks to engineer the entire enterprise in terms of the [[Product (business)|product]]s, [[Process modeling|process]]es and [[business operations]]. The view is one of continuous improvement and continued adaptation as firms, processes and markets develop along their [[Enterprise Life Cycle|life cycle]]s. This total systems approach encompasses the traditional areas of research and development, product design, operations and manufacturing as well as information systems and strategic management.&lt;ref name="Pil08"/&gt; This fields is related to [[engineering management]], [[operations management]], [[service management]] and systems engineering.

In the context of [[software development]] a specific field of enterprise engineering has emerged, which deals with the modelling and integration of various organizational and technical parts of [[business process]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[[François Vernadat|Vernadat, F.B]]. (1996) ''Enterprise Modeling and Integration: Principles and Applications''. Chapman &amp; Hall, London, {{ISBN|0-412-60550-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of information systems development it has been the area of activity in the organization of the [[systems analysis]], and an extension of the scope of [[Information Modelling]].&lt;ref&gt;J A Bubenko (1993). "Extending the Scope of Information Modelling". In: ''Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on the Deductive Approach to Information Systems and Databases, Costa Brava, Catalonia''. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be viewed as the extension and generalization of the [[systems analysis]] and [[systems design]] phases of the [[software development process]].&lt;ref name="GG03"&gt;Gustas, R and Gustiene, P (2003) "Towards the Enterprise engineering approach for Information system modelling across organisational and technical boundaries", in: ''Proceedings of the fifth International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems'', vol. 3, Angers, France, 2003, pp. 77-88.&lt;/ref&gt; Here Enterprise modelling can be part of the early, middle and late [[Systems Development Life Cycle|information system development life cycle]]. Explicit representation of the organizational and technical system infrastructure is being created in order to understand the orderly transformations of existing work practices.&lt;ref name="GG03"/&gt; This field is also called [[Enterprise architecture]], or defined with [[Enterprise Ontology]] as being two major parts of Enterprise architecture.&lt;ref name="Die06"/&gt;

== Related fields ==
=== Business reference modelling ===
[[Image:Government Business Reference Model.svg|thumb|320px|Example of the US [[Federal Enterprise Architecture|FEA]] Business Reference Model.&lt;ref&gt;FEA (2005) [https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/pdf/rm-profile.pdf FEA Records Management Profile, Version 1.0]. December 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Business reference model]]ling is the development of [[reference model]]s concentrating on the functional and organizational aspects of the [[core business]] of an [[Business|enterprise]], [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service organization]] or [[government agency]]. In enterprise engineering a business reference model is part of an [[enterprise architecture framework]]. This framework defines in a series of reference models, how to organize the structure and [[view model|views]] associated with an [[Enterprise Architecture]].

A [[reference model]] in general is a model of something that embodies the basic goal or idea of something and can then be looked at as a reference for various purposes. A business reference model is a means to describe the [[business operations]] of an organization, independent of the [[organizational structure]] that perform them. Other types of business reference model can also depict the relationship between the [[business process]]es, business functions, and the [[business area]]’s business reference model. These reference model can be constructed in layers, and offer a foundation for the analysis of service components, technology, data, and performance.

=== Economic modelling ===
[[Image:Islm.svg|thumb|left|A diagram of the [[IS/LM model]]]]
[[Economic model]]ling is the theoretical representation of economic processes by a set of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] and a set of [[logic]]al and/or quantitative relationships between them. The economic model is a simplified framework designed to illustrate complex processes, often but not always using [[Mathematical model|mathematical techniques]]. Frequently, economic models use structural parameters. Structural parameters are underlying [[Parameter#Statistics and econometrics|parameters]] in a model or class of models.&lt;ref&gt;Moffatt, Mike. (2008) [[About.com]] ''[http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/structuralp.htm Structural Parameters]'' Economics Glossary; Terms Beginning with S. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A model may have various parameters and those parameters may change to create various properties.&lt;ref name="structure"&gt;Moffatt, Mike. (2008) [[About.com]] ''[http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/structure.htm Structure]'' Economics Glossary; Terms Beginning with S. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general terms, economic models have two functions: first as a simplification of and abstraction from observed data, and second as a means of selection of data based on a [[paradigm]] of [[econometric]] study. The simplification is particularly important for economics given the enormous [[complexity]] of economic processes.  This complexity can be attributed to the diversity of factors that determine economic activity; these factors include: individual  and [[co-operation|cooperative]] decision processes, [[Natural resource|resource]] limitations, [[natural environment|environment]]al and [[geography|geographical]] constraints, institutional and [[law|legal]] requirements and purely random fluctuations.  Economists therefore must make a reasoned choice of which variables and which relationships between these variables are relevant and which ways of analyzing and presenting this information are useful.

=== Ontology engineering ===
[[Ontology engineering]] or ''ontology building'' is a subfield of [[knowledge engineering]] that studies the methods and methodologies for building ontologies. In the domain of enterprise architecture, an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] is an outline or a schema used to structure objects, their attributes and relationships in a consistent manner.&lt;ref name="Ostie96"/&gt; As in enterprise modelling, an ontology can be composed of other ontologies. The purpose of ontologies in enterprise modelling is to formalize and establish the sharability, re-usability, assimilation and dissemination of information across all organizations and departments within an enterprise. Thus, an ontology enables integration of the various functions and processes which take place in an enterprise.&lt;ref name="FFG94"&gt;G. Fadel, M. Fox, [[M. Gruninger]] (1994). "A Generic Enterprise Resource Ontology". In: ''Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises''. p. 117-128&lt;/ref&gt;

One common language with well articulated structure and vocabulary would enable the company to be more efficient in its operations. A common ontology will allow for effective communication, understanding and thus coordination among the various divisions of an enterprise. There are various kinds of ontologies used in numerous environments. While the language example given earlier dealt with the area of information systems and design, other ontologies may be defined for processes, methods, activities, etc., within an enterprise.&lt;ref name="Ostie96"/&gt;

Using ontologies in enterprise modelling offers several advantages. Ontologies ensure clarity, consistency, and structure to a model. They promote efficient model definition and analysis. Generic [[enterprise ontologies]] allow for reusability of and automation of components. Because ontologies are schemata or outlines, the use of ontologies does not ensure proper enterprise model definition, analysis, or clarity. Ontologies are limited by how they are defined and implemented. An ontology may or may not include the potential or capability to capture all of the aspects of what is being modelled.&lt;ref name="Ostie96"/&gt;

=== Systems thinking ===
{{main|Systems thinking}}
The modelling of the enterprise and its environment could facilitate the creation of enhanced understanding of the business domain and processes of the extended enterprise, and especially of the relations—both those that "hold the enterprise together" and those that extend across the boundaries of the enterprise. Since enterprise is a system, concepts used in system thinking&lt;ref&gt;(see, for example, (Weinberg, 1982), or, more generally, works by Bunge, for example, (Bunge, 2003) and by Hayek, for example, (Hayek, 1967))&lt;/ref&gt; can be successfully reused in modelling enterprises.

This way a fast understanding can be achieved throughout the enterprise about how business functions are working and how they depend upon other functions in the organization.

'''Estuarine acidification''' happens when the [[pH]] balance of water in coastal marine ecosystems, specifically those of [[estuaries]], decreases. Water, generally considered neutral on the [[PH|pH scale]], normally perfectly balanced between [[alkalinity]] and [[Acid|acidity]].While [[ocean acidification]] occurs due to the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans, caused by the absorption of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the atmosphere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/425365a |pmid=14508477 |title=Oceanography: Anthropogenic carbon and ocean pH |journal=Nature |volume=425 |issue=6956 |pages=365 |year=2003 |last1=Caldeira |first1=Ken |last2=Wickett |first2=Michael E. |bibcode=2003Natur.425..365C }}&lt;/ref&gt; pH change in '''estuaries''' is more complicated than in the open ocean due to direct impacts from land run-off, human impact, and coastal current dynamics. In the ocean, wave and wind movement allows carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to mixes with water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) forming carbonic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Through wave motion this chemical bond is mixed up, allowing for the further break of the bond, eventually becoming [[carbonate]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) which is [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] and helps form shells for ocean creatures, and two [[Hydronium|hydron]] molecules. This creates the potential for acidic threat since hydron ions readily bond with any [[Lewis structure|Lewis Structure]] to form an acidic bond. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-7424-4_24|title=The Structure of Small Molecules and Ions|last=Weinhold|first=Frank|last2=Carpenter|first2=John E.|date=1988|publisher=Springer, Boston, MA|isbn=9781468474268|pages=227–236|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-7424-4_24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is referred to as an [[Redox|oxidation-reduction reaction]]. 

The basic chemical equation is as follows: 

:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

When this pattern of absorption is transferred into an '''estuary''', however, acidity increases simply due to relative volume. Ocean water counts for the absorption of 30-40 percent of all CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted into the atmosphere and yet, due to its immense volume, it remains relatively resilient. &lt;ref name="Kitack"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feely|first1=R.

==Causes of variable pH==

===Freshwater flow===
An [[estuary]] is defined as "a water passage where the tide meets a river current". The pH of estuaries is highly variable because of freshwater flow from rivers and groundwater, as well as primary productivity (exacerbated by nutrient loading) and coastal upwelling. Fresh water from rivers typically has a lower pH than ocean water (~7 compared to ~8). Seasonal and annual changes in river flow entering an estuary can change the pH by whole units.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ozcoasts.gov.au/indicators/ph_coastal_waterways.jsp{{full|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photosynthesis and respiration===
[[Primary production]] (plant growth) changes pH on a daily, seasonal, and annual basis. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is removed from the water, increasing pH. Organisms release carbon dioxide during respiration.&lt;ref&gt;NOAA [http://estuaries.noaa.gov/Doc/PDF/LS1_SurvivalEstuary.pdf "Estuary Education"]&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a daily cycle of increased pH during daylight hours and a decrease in pH during the night, when respiration is dominant. Similarly, pH is higher during the winter when grazing is low compared to productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ecss.2010.05.004 |bibcode=2010ECSS...88..442F |title=The combined effects of ocean acidification, mixing, and respiration on pH and carbonate saturation in an urbanized estuary |journal=Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=442–9 |year=2010 |last1=Feely |first1=Richard A. |last2=Alin |first2=Simone R. |last3=Newton |first3=Jan |last4=Sabine |first4=Christopher L. |last5=Warner |first5=Mark |last6=Devol |first6=Allan |last7=Krembs |first7=Christopher |last8=Maloy |first8=Carol }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effluent===
Many estuaries experience nutrient loading from runoff containing wastewater effluent or fertilizers, natural or artificial. Increased nutrients can stimulate primary productivity and alter the balance between primary productivity and respiration. This process can change pH by whole units within the estuary. Both these processes make it difficult to measure the overall change in pH associated with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.This causes a change in pH by whole units in the estuary. This makes it hard to measure the overall change in pH, as well as the increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/2049/chapter/9|title=A   THE ROLE OF NUTRIENTS IN COASTAL WATERS {{!}} Managing Wastewater in Coastal Urban Areas {{!}} The National Academies Press|language=en|doi=10.17226/2049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Currents===
Areas with coastal upwelling such as the west coast of North America have experienced increases in acidification due to more acidic deep water upwelling into the estuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1155676 |pmid=18497259 |title=Evidence for Upwelling of Corrosive "Acidified" Water onto the Continental Shelf |journal=Science |volume=320 |issue=5882 |pages=1490–2 |year=2008 |last1=Feely |first1=R.

==Impact on marine life==
[[File:Coccolithus pelagicus.jpg|link=coccolithophore|thumb|A [[coccolithophore]] with many [[coccolith]]s (plates) formed from calcium carbonate]]
As the pH of marine systems decreases, it causes [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]]&lt;ref name=Kitack/&gt; to keep in [[chemical equilibrium]]. Calcium carbonate is vital to calcifying organisms such as shellfish, corals, and [[coccolithophores]] (a type of phytoplankton). Acidification also harms micro-organisms in the environment. These organisms either directly provide humans with a food source or supports an ecosystem important to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02571.x |pmid=21906222 |title=Effects of ocean acidification on microbial community composition of, and oxygen fluxes through, biofilms from the Great Barrier Reef |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=13 |issue=11 |pages=2976–89 |year=2011 |last1=Witt |first1=Verena |last2=Wild |first2=Christian |last3=Anthony |first3=Kenneth R.

[[Image:Tree of life.svg|right|thumb|A [[phylogenetic tree]] of living things]]
'''Evolutionary ecology''' lies at the intersection of [[ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. It approaches the study of ecology in a way that explicitly considers the evolutionary histories of species and the interactions between them. Conversely, it can be seen as an approach to the study of evolution that incorporates an understanding of the interactions between the species under consideration. The main subfields of evolutionary ecology are [[Life history theory|life history evolution]], [[sociobiology]] (the [[evolution]] of social [[behavior]]), the evolution of inter specific relations ([[cooperation]], [[Predator-prey interaction|predator–prey interactions]], [[parasitism]], [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]) and the evolution of [[biodiversity]] and of [[Community|communities]].

Evolutionary ecology mostly considers two things: how interactions (both among species and between species and their physical environment) shape species through selection and adaptation, and the consequences of the resulting evolutionary change.

==Evolutionary models==
{{Evolutionary biology}}
A large part of evolutionary ecology is about utilising models and finding empirical data as proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morozov|first=Andrew|date=2013-12-06|title=Modelling biological evolution: recent progress, current challenges and future direction|journal=Interface Focus|volume=3|issue=6|pages=20130054|doi=10.1098/rsfs.2013.0054|issn=2042-8898|pmc=3915852}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the Lack clutch size model devised by [[David Lack]] and his study of [[Darwin's finches]] on the Galapagos Islands. Lack's study of Darwin's finches was important in analyzing the role of different ecological factors in [[speciation]]. Lack suggested that differences in species were adaptive and produced by [[natural selection]], based on the assertion by G.F. Gause that two species cannot occupy the same niche.&lt;ref&gt;"Lack, David Lambert." Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography, vol. 17, Charles Scribner's Sons, 2008, pp. 521–523. Gale Virtual Reference Library, go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;u=tusc49521&amp;v=2.1&amp;id=GALE%7CCX2830905204&amp;it=r&amp;asid=f73ad736d17e749682f6a72c03aeca54. Accessed 10 Nov. 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Levins]] introduced his model of the specialization of species in 1968, which investigated how habitat specialization evolved within heterogeneous environments using the fitness sets an organism or species possesses. This model developed the concept of spatial scales in specific environments, defining fine-grained spatial scales and coarse-grained spatial scales.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Joel S., and Noel B. Pavlovic. “Evolution in heterogeneous environments: Effects of migration on habitat specialization.” Evolutionary Ecology, vol. 6, no. 5, 1992, pp. 360–382. {{doi|10.1007/bf02270698}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of this model include a rapid increase in environmental ecologists' understanding of how spatial scales impact species diversity in a certain environment.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Simon P., et al. “The spatial scales of species coexistence.” Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution, vol. 1, no. 8, 2017, pp. 1066–1073. {{doi|10.1038/s41559-017-0230-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model is Law and Diekmann's 1996 models on [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], which is defined as a relationship between two organisms that benefits both individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Bronstein, Judith. “Mutualisms and Symbioses.” Oxford Bibliographies, 20 Nov 2017, www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0006.xml.&lt;/ref&gt; Law and Diekmann developed a framework called adaptive dynamics, which assumes that changes in plant or animal populations in response to a disturbance or lack thereof occurs at a faster rate than mutations occur. It is aimed to simplify other models addressing the relationships within communities.&lt;ref&gt;Akçay, Erol. (2015). Evolutionary models of mutualism. In J. L. Bronstein (Ed.), Mutualism (pp. 57–76). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tangled nature model ==
The tangled nature model provides different methods for demonstrating and predicting trends in evolutionary ecology. The model analyzes an individual prone to [[mutation]] within a population as well as other factors such as extinction rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Tangled Nature Model of Evolutionary Ecology: An Overview |author=Laird, Simon |journal=Mathematical Modeling of Biological Systems| volume= II|pages= 49–62 |doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4556-4_5|year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8176-4555-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was developed by Simon Laird, Daniel Lawson, and Henrik Jeldtoft Jensen of the Imperial College London in 2002. The purpose of the model is to create a simple and logical ecological model based on observation. The model is designed such that ecological effects can be accounted for when determining form, and fitness of a population.

== Ecological genetics ==
Ecological genetics tie into evolutionary ecology through the study of how traits evolve in natural populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0021214.html |title=Ecological Genetics |publisher=Wiley |date=September 2016 |access-date=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists are concerned with how the environment and timeframe leads to genes becoming dominant. Organisms must continually adapt in order to survive in natural habitats. Genes define which organisms survive and which will die out. When organisms develop different genetic variations, even though they stem from the same species, it is known as polymorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Polymorphism |title=Polymorphism |publisher=biology online |date=December 6, 2008 |access-date=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms that pass on beneficial genes continue to evolve their species to have an advantage inside of their niche.

=== Charles Darwin ===

The basis of the central principles of evolutionary ecology can be attributed to [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882), specifically in referencing his theory of [[natural selection]] and [[population dynamics]], which discusses how populations of a species change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/ecologyapp/modules/population-dynamics/|title=Population Dynamics {{!}} e-cology|website=sites.nicholas.duke.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ernst Mayr]], professor of Zoology at Harvard University, Darwin’s most distinct contributions to evolutionary biology and ecology are as follows: “The first is the non-constancy of species, or the modern conception of [[evolution]] itself. The second is the notion of branching evolution, implying the common descent of all species of living things on earth from a single unique origin.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/darwins-influence-on-modern-thought/|title=Darwin's Influence on Modern Thought|last=Mayr|first=Ernst|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, “Darwin further noted that evolution must be gradual, with no major breaks or discontinuities. Finally, he reasoned that the mechanism of evolution was natural selection.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/darwins-influence-on-modern-thought/|title=Darwin's Influence on Modern Thought|last=Mayr|first=Ernst|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== George Evelyn Hutchinson ===
[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson|George Evelyn Hutchinson’s]] (1903–1991) contributions to the field of ecology spanned over 60 years, in which he had significant influence in systems ecology, radiation ecology, [[limnology]], and [[entomology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slobodkin|first=L.B.|date=1993|title=An Appreciation: George Evelyn Hutchinson|jstor=5370|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|volume=62|issue=2|pages=390–394|doi=10.2307/5370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as the “father of modern ecology” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slobodkin|first=L.B.|date=1993|title=An Appreciation: George Evelyn Hutchinson|jstor=5370|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|volume=62|issue=2|pages=390–394|doi=10.2307/5370}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Stephen Jay Gould]], Hutchinson was one of the first scientists to link the subjects of ecology and mathematics. According to Hutchinson, he constructed “mathematical models of populations, the changing proportions of individuals of various ages, birthrate, the [[ecological niche]], and population interaction in this technical introduction to population ecology.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60322007|title=Introduction to population ecology|last=1943-|first=Rockwood, Larry L.,|date=2006|publisher=Blackwell Pub|isbn=9781405132633|location=Malden, MA|oclc=60322007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also had a vast interest in limnology, due to his belief that lakes could be studied as a [[microcosm (experimental ecosystem)|microcosm]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;that provides insight into system behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyland|first=Callen|date=Summer 2011|title=The Art of Ecology, Writings of G.

If a set of properties in either system changes in such a way that the action of the first system on the second changes, this may cause changes in properties of the second system which alter the mode of action of the second system on the first.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutchinson|first=G.

=== Robert MacArthur ===

[[Robert H. MacArthur|Robert MacArthur]] (1930–1972) is best known in the field of Evolutionary Ecology for his work ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]'', in which he and his co-author propose “that the number of species on any island reflects a balance between the rate at which new species colonize it and the rate at which populations of established species become [[Extinction|extinct]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Island_Biogeography.html|title=Island Biogeography|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eric Pianka ===

According to the University of Texas, [[Eric Pianka]]’s (1939–present) work in evolutionary ecology includes foraging strategies, reproductive tactics, competition and niche theory, community structure and organization, species diversity, and understanding rarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/ERP-Contributions.html|title=Eric Pianka's Contributions to Ecology|website=www.zo.utexas.edu|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pianka is also known for his interest in lizards to study ecological occurrences, as he claimed they were “often abundant, making them relatively easy to locate, observe, and capture.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/ERP-Contributions.html|title=Eric Pianka's Contributions to Ecology|website=www.zo.utexas.edu|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Michael Rosenzweig ===

[[Michael Rosenzweig|Michael L. Rosenzweig]] (1941–present) created and popularized [[Reconciliation ecology]], which began with his theory that designated nature preserves would not be enough land to conserve the [[biodiversity]] of Earth, as humans have used so much land that they have negatively impacted [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and had other ecological impacts that have negatively affected species compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62866022|title=Win-win ecology : how the earth's species can survive in the midst of human enterprise|last=L.|first=Rosenzweig, Michael|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195156041|location=Oxford|oclc=62866022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Michael Rosenzweig's idea of [[reconciliation ecology]] was developed based on existing research, which was conducted on the principle first suggested by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] stating that larger areas of land will have increased species diversity as compared to smaller areas. This research focused on [[Species–area relationship|species-area relationships]] (SPARs) and the different scales on which they exist, ranging from sample-area to interprovincial SPARs. Steady-state dynamics in diversity gave rise to these SPARs, which are now used to measure the reduction of species diversity on Earth. In response to this decline in diversity, Rosenzweig's reconciliation ecology was born.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenzweig, Michael L. “Reconciliation ecology and the future of species diversity.” Oryx, vol. 37, no. 02, 10 Feb. 2003, {{doi|10.1017/s0030605303000371}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary ecology has been studied using symbiotic relationships between organisms to determine the evolutionary forces by which such relationships develop. In symbiotic relationships, the [[symbiont]] must confer some advantage to its host in order to persist and continue to be evolutionarily viable. Research has been conducted using aphids and the symbiotic bacteria with which they coevolve. These bacteria are most frequently conserved from generation to generation, displaying high levels of [[vertical transmission]].

'''Expectancy theory''' (or '''expectancy theory of motivation''') proposes an individual will behave or act in a certain way because they are motivated to select a specific behavior over other behaviors due to what they expect the result of that selected [[behavior]] will be.&lt;ref name="Oliver, R. 1974"&gt;Oliver, R. (August, 1974). Expectancy is the probability that the individual assigns to work effort being followed by a given level of achieved task performance. Expectancy Theory Predictions of Salesmen's Performance. Journal of Marketing Research 11, 243-253.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the motivation of the behavior selection is determined by the desirability of the outcome. However, at the core of the theory is the [[cognitive]] process of how an individual processes the different motivational elements. This is done before making the ultimate choice. The outcome is not the sole determining factor in making the decision of how to behave.&lt;ref name="Oliver, R. 1974"/&gt;

Expectancy theory is about the mental processes regarding choice, or choosing. It explains the processes that an individual undergoes to make choices. In the study of [[organizational behavior]], expectancy theory is a [[motivation]] theory first proposed by [[Victor Vroom]] of the [[Yale School of Management]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"This theory emphasizes the needs for organizations to relate rewards directly to performance and to ensure that the rewards provided are those rewards deserved and wanted by the recipients."&lt;ref&gt;Montana, Patrick J; Charnov, Bruce H, Management – 4th edition; (2008) – Barron's Educational Series, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-7641-3931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Victor H. Vroom (1964) defines [[motivation]] as a process governing choices among alternative forms of voluntary activities, a process controlled by the individual. The individual makes choices based on estimates of how well the expected results of a given behavior are going to match up with or eventually lead to the desired results. Motivation is a product of the individual's expectancy that a certain effort will lead to the intended performance, the instrumentality of this performance to achieving a certain result, and the desirability of this result for the individual, known as ''valence''.&lt;ref&gt;(S.E. Condrey, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;482)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
In 1964, Victor H. Vroom developed the expectancy theory through his study of the motivations behind decision making. This theory is relevant to the study of [[management]].

==Key elements==
The expectancy theory of motivation explains the behavioral process of why individuals choose one behavioral option over the other. This theory explains that individuals can be motivated towards goals if they believe that there is a positive correlation between efforts and performance, the outcome of a favorable performance will result in a desirable reward, a reward from a performance will satisfy an important need, and/or the outcome satisfies their need enough to make the effort worthwhile.
Vroom introduced three variables within the expectancy theory which are [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] (V), expectancy (E) and instrumentality (I). The three elements are important behind choosing one element over another because they are clearly defined: effort-performance expectancy (E&gt;P expectancy), performance-outcome expectancy (P&gt;O expectancy).&lt;ref&gt;P. Subba Rao, Personnel and Human Resource Management – Text and cases; (2000) – Himalaya Publishing House {{ISBN|81-7493-777-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expectancy theory has three components: expectancy, instrumentality, and valence.

# Expectancy: effort → performance (E→P)
# Instrumentality: performance → outcome (P→O)
# Valence: V(R) outcome → reward

===Expectancy: effort → performance (E→P)===
Expectancy is the belief that one's effort (E) will result in attainment of desired performance (P) goals. Usually based on an individual's past experience, self-confidence (self efficacy), and the perceived difficulty of the performance standard or goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chiang |first1=Chun-Fang |last2=Jang |first2=SooCheong (Shawn) |date=June 2008 |title=An expectancy theory model for hotel employee motivation |journal=Journal of Hospitality Management |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=313–322 |doi=10.1016/j.ijhm.2007.07.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
# Self efficacy – the person's belief about their ability to successfully perform a particular behavior. The individual will assess whether they have the required skills or knowledge desired to achieve their goals.
# Goal difficulty – when goals are set too high or performance expectations that are made too difficult. This will most likely lead to low expectancy. This occurs when the individual believes that their desired results are unattainable.
# Perceived control – Individuals must believe that they have some degree of control over the expected outcome. When individuals perceive that the outcome is beyond their ability to influence, expectancy, and thus motivation, is low.

===Instrumentality: Performance → Outcome (P→O)===
Instrumentality is the belief that a person will receive a reward if the performance expectation is met. This reward may present itself in the form of a pay increase, promotion, recognition or sense of accomplishment. Instrumentality is low when the reward is the same for all performances given.

Another way that instrumental outcomes work is commissions. With commissions performance is directly correlated with outcome (how much money is made). If performance is high and many goods are sold the more money the person will make.

Factors associated with the individual's instrumentality for outcomes are trust, control and policies:
* Trusting the people who will decide who gets what outcome, based on the performance,
* Control of how the decision is made, of who gets what outcome,
* Policies understanding of the correlation between performance and outcomes.

===Valence V(R)===
Valence:&lt;ref name="scholar.lib.vt.edu"&gt;Maslow—Move Aside! A Heuristical Motivation Model for Leaders in Career and Technical Education Pg. 10 – 11 http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JITE/v44n2/pdf/kroth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the value an individual places on the rewards of an outcome, which is based on their needs, goals, values and sources of motivation. Influential factors include one's values, needs, goals, preferences and sources that strengthen their motivation for a particular outcome.

Valence is characterized by the extent to which a person values a given outcome or reward. This is not an actual level of satisfaction rather the expected satisfaction of a particular outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Redmond|first=Brian|title=Expectancy Theory|url=https://wikispaces.psu.edu/display/PSYCH484/4.+Expectancy+Theory|publisher=Shaun Miller|accessdate=12/04/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The valence refers to the value the individual personally places on the rewards. -1 →0→ +1

'''-1= avoiding the outcome 0 = indifferent to the outcome +1 = welcomes the outcome'''

In order for the valence to be positive, the person must prefer attaining the outcome to not attaining it.

 Valence is one behavioral alternative, where the decision is measured on the value of the reward. The model below shows the direction of motivation, when behavior is energized:

'''Motivational Force (MF) = Expectancy x Instrumentality x Valence'''

When deciding among behavioral options, individuals select the option with the greatest amount of motivational force (MF). 
[[Expectancy]] and [[Instrumental and value rationality|instrumentality]] are attitudes (cognitions), whereas valence is rooted in an individual's value system.
 
Examples of valued outcomes in the workplace include, pay increases and bonuses, promotions, time off, new assignments, recognition, etc. If management can effectively determine what their employee values, this will allow the manager to motivate employees in order to get the highest result and effectiveness out of the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidt|first=Charles|title=Motivation: Expectancy Theory|url=http://www.uri.edu/research/lrc/scholl/webnotes/Motivation_Expectancy.htm|publisher=Richard Scholl|accessdate=12/04/2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009113406/http://www.uri.edu/research/lrc/scholl/webnotes/Motivation_Expectancy.htm|archive-date=2014-10-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==
===Management===
Victor Vroom's expectancy theory is one such [[management theory]] focused on motivation. According to Holdford and Lovelace-Elmore (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;8), Vroom asserts, "intensity of work effort depends on the perception that an individual's effort will result in a desired outcome".

In order to enhance the performance-outcome tie, managers should use systems that tie rewards very closely to performance. Managers also need to ensure that the rewards provided are deserved and wanted by the recipients.&lt;ref name="Montana, Patrick J 2008"&gt;Montana, Patrick J; Charnov, Bruce H, Management - 4th edition; (2008) - Barron's Educational Series, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-7641-3931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to improve the effort-performance tie, managers should engage in training to improve their capabilities and improve their belief that added effort will in fact lead to better performance.&lt;ref name="Montana, Patrick J 2008"/&gt;

- Emphasizes [[self-interest]] in the alignment of rewards with employee's wants.

- Emphasizes the connections among expected behaviors, rewards and organizational goals

Expectancy Theory, though well known in work motivation literature, is not as familiar to scholars or practitioners outside that field.

===Computer users===

Lori Baker-Eveleth and Robert Stone, [[University of Idaho]] in 2008 conducted an [[empirical]] study on 154 faculty members' reactions to the use of new software.&lt;ref&gt;Baker-Eveleth L., Stone,R.W.(2008) Expectancy theory and behavioral intentions to use computer applications - Interdisciplinary Journal of Information&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that ease of system use affects both [[self-efficacy]] (self-confidence) and anticipated usefulness. These in turn influenced the decision, or anticipated decision, to use the software. 

Self-efficacy and outcome expectancy impact a person's affect and behavior separately: 

- Self-efficacy is the belief that a person possesses the skills and abilities to successfully accomplish something.

- Outcome expectancy is the belief that when a person accomplishes the task, a desired outcome is attained. 

Self-efficacy has a direct impact on outcome expectancy and has a larger effect than outcome expectancy. Employees will accept [[technology]] if they believe the technology is a benefit to them. If an employee is mandated to use the technology, the employees will use it but may feel it is not useful. On the other hand, when an employee is not mandated, the employee may be influenced by these other factors (self-confidene and confidence in outcome) that it should be used.

The self-efficacy theory can be applied to predicting and perceiving an employee's belief for computer use (Bandura, 1986; Bates &amp; Khasawneh, 2007). This theory associates an individual's cognitive state with effective behavioral outcomes (Staples, Hulland, &amp; Higgins, 1998).

Other constructs of the self-efficacy theory that impact attitudes and intentions to perform are:

- past experience or mastery with the task; 

- vicarious experience performing the task; 

- emotional or physiological arousal regarding the task; 

- and social persuasion to perform the task.

===Models of teacher expectancy effects===
[[Jere Brophy]] and Thomas Good&lt;ref&gt;Jere Brophy, Thomas Good (1974) Teacher-Student Relationships: Causes and Consequences New York, Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jere Brophy, Thomas Good (1987)Looking in classrooms (4th ed.), New York, Harper and Row&lt;/ref&gt; provided a comprehensive model of how teacher expectations could influence children's achievement. Their model posits that teachers' expectations indirectly affect children's achievement: "teacher expectations could also affect student outcomes indirectly by leading to differential teacher treatment of students that would condition student attitudes, expectations, and behavior" (Brophy, 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;639). The model includes the following sequence. Teachers form differential expectations for students early in the school year. Based on these expectations, they behave differently toward different students, and as a result of these behaviors the students begin to understand what the teacher expects from them. If students accept the teachers' expectations and behavior toward them then they will be more likely to act in ways that confirm the teacher's initial expectations. This process will ultimately affect student achievement so that teachers' initial expectancies are confirmed.&lt;ref name="Schunk, Dale H. 2012. pp. 96-97"&gt;Schunk, Dale H.; Meece, Judith L.. Student Perceptions in the Classroom. Mahwah: Routledge, 2012. Ebook Library. pp. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing work related to this model, Brophy (1983) made several important observations about teacher expectation effects. First and foremost, he argued that most of the beliefs teachers hold about student are accurate, and so their expectations usually reflect students' actual performance levels. As a result, Brophy contended that self-fulfilling prophecy effects have relatively weak effects on student achievement, changing achievement 5% to 10%, although he did note that such effects usually are negative expectation effects rather than positive effects. Second, he pointed out that various situational and individual difference factors influence the extent to which teacher expectations will act as self-fulfilling prophecies. For instance, Brophy stated that expectancy effects may be larger in the early elementary grades, because teachers have more one-on-one interactions with students then, as they attempt to socialize children into the student role. In the upper elementary grades more whole-class teaching methods are used, which may minimize expectation effects. Some evidence supports this claim; expectancy effects in Rosenthal and Jacobson's (1968) study were strongest during the earlier grades. Raudenbush's (1984) meta-analysis of findings from different teacher expectancy studies in which expectancies were induced by giving teachers artificial information about children's intelligence showed that expectancy effects were stronger in Grades 1 and 2 than in Grades 3 through Grade 6, especially when the information was given to teachers during the first few weeks of school. These findings are particularly relevant because they show a form of the expectancy theory: how teachers have certain expectations of students, and how they treat the students differently because of those expectations.&lt;ref name="Schunk, Dale H. 2012. pp. 96-97"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
Critics of the expectancy model include Graen (1969), Lawler (1971), Lawler and Porter (1967), and Porter and Lawler (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0030-5073(73)90066-4 |title=Expectancy theory and job behavior |journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Performance |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=482 |year=1973 |last1=Lawler |first1=Edward E |last2=Suttle |first2=J.Lloyd }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their criticisms of the theory were based upon the expectancy model being too simplistic in nature; these critics started making adjustments to Vroom's model.

Edward Lawler claims that the simplicity of expectancy theory is deceptive because it assumes that if an employer makes a reward, such as a financial bonus or promotion, enticing enough, employees will increase their productivity to obtain the reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ceo.usc.edu/pdf/T922205.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610224740/http://ceo.usc.edu/pdf/T922205.pdf |archive-date=2010-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this only works if the employees believe the reward is beneficial to their immediate needs. For example, a $2 increase in salary may not be desirable to an employee if the increase pushes her into a tax bracket in which she believes her net pay is actually reduced, which is actually impossible in the United States with marginal tax brackets. Similarly, a promotion that provides higher status but requires longer hours may be a deterrent to an employee who values evening and weekend time with their children.

In addition to that, if anyone in the armed forces or security agencies is promoted, there is a must condition for such promotions, that he/she will be transferred to other locations. In such cases, if the new place is far from their permanent residence, where their family is residing, they will not be motivated by such promotions, and the results will be other way round. Because, the outcome, which this reward (promotion) will yield, may not be valued by those who are receiving it.

Lawler's new proposal for expectancy theory is not against Vroom's theory. Lawler argues that since there have been a variety of developments of expectancy theory since its creation in 1964; the expectancy model needs to be updated. Lawler's new model is based on four claims.&lt;ref name="web.dcp.ufl.edu"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.dcp.ufl.edu/hinze/Expectancy.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027133712/http://web.dcp.ufl.edu/hinze/Expectancy.htm |archive-date=2010-10-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, whenever there are a number of outcomes, individuals will usually have a preference among those outcomes. Two, there is a belief on the part of that individual that their action(s) will achieve the outcome they desire. Three, any desired outcome was generated by the individual's behavior. Finally, the actions generated by the individual were generated by the preferred outcome and expectation of the individual.

Instead of just looking at expectancy and instrumentality, W.F. Maloney and J.M. McFillen&lt;ref name="web.dcp.ufl.edu"/&gt; found that expectancy theory could explain the motivation of those individuals who were employed by the construction industry. For instance, they used worker expectancy and worker instrumentality. Worker expectancy is when supervisors create an equal match between the worker and their job. Worker instrumentality is when an employee knows that any increase in their performance leads to achieving their goal.

In the chapter entitled "On the Origins of Expectancy Theory" published in ''Great Minds in Management'' by Ken G. Smith and Michael A. Hitt, Vroom himself agreed with some of these criticisms and stated that he felt that the theory should be expanded to include research conducted since the original publication of his book.

[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|Before flue gas desulfurization was installed, the emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained a significant amount of sulfur dioxide.]]
[[File:G_G_Allen_Steam_Plant,_scrubber.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[G. G. Allen Steam Station]] scrubber]]
'''Flue-gas desulfurization''' ('''FGD''') is a set of technologies used to remove [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|SO|2}}) from [[Flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion|exhaust flue gases of fossil-fuel power plant]]s, and from the emissions of other sulfur oxide emitting processes (e.g [[trash incineration]])

==Methods==
As stringent environmental regulations regarding SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions have been enacted in many countries, {{chem|SO|2}} is now being removed from flue gases by a variety of methods. Below are common methods used:

*[[Wet scrubber|Wet scrubbing]] using a slurry of alkaline [[sorbent]], usually [[limestone]] or [[lime (mineral)|lime]], or seawater to scrub gases;
*[[Spray drying|Spray-dry]] scrubbing using similar sorbent slurries;
*[[Wet sulfuric acid process]] recovering [[sulfur]] in the form of commercial quality [[sulfuric acid]];
*[[SNOX process|SNOX Flue gas desulfurization]] removes sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates from flue gases;
*Dry sorbent injection systems that introduce powdered hydrated lime (or other sorbent material) into exhaust ducts to eliminate SO2 and SO3 from process emissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nol-tec.com/documents/pdfs/NTS_FGD_02_09_B.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

For a typical coal-fired power station, flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) may remove 90 percent or more of the {{chem|SO|2}} in the flue gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.compositech-filters.com/power-exhaust-filters|title=Flue Gas Desulfurization - FGD Wastewater Treatment {{!}} Compositech Filters Manufacturer|last=Inc.|first=Compositech Products Manufacturing,|website=www.compositech-filters.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Methods of removing [[sulfur dioxide]] from boiler and furnace exhaust gases have been studied for over 150 years.  Early ideas for flue gas desulfurization were established in [[England]] around 1850.

With the construction of large-scale power plants in England in the 1920s, the problems associated with large volumes of {{chem|SO|2}} from a single site began to concern the public.  The {{chem|SO|2}} emissions problem did not receive much attention until 1929, when the [[House of Lords]] upheld the claim of a landowner against the Barton Electricity Works of the [[Manchester Corporation]] for damages to his land resulting from {{chem|SO|2}} emissions.  Shortly thereafter, a press campaign was launched against the erection of power plants within the confines of London.  This outcry led to the imposition of {{chem|SO|2}} controls on all such power plants.&lt;ref name=Biondo&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Biondo |first1=S.J. |last2=Marten |first2=J.C. |title=A History of Flue Gas Desulphurization Systems Since 1850 |journal=Journal of the Air Pollution Control Association |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=948–61 |date=October 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major FGD unit at a utility was installed in 1931 at [[Battersea Power Station]], owned by [[London Power Company]].  In 1935, an FGD system similar to that installed at Battersea went into service at Swansea Power Station.  The third major FGD system was installed in 1938 at [[Fulham Power Station]]. These three early large-scale FGD installations were abandoned during [[World War II]].  Large-scale FGD units did not reappear at utilities until the 1970s, where most of the installations occurred in the [[United States]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=Biondo/&gt;

As of June 1973, there were 42 FGD units in operation, 36 in Japan and 6 in the United States, ranging in capacity from 5 [[Megawatt|MW]] to 250 MW.&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;Beychok, Milton R., ''Coping With SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', Chemical Engineering/Deskbook Issue, 21 October 1974&lt;/ref&gt; As of around 1999 and 2000, FGD units were being used in 27 countries, and there were 678 FGD units operating at a total power plant capacity of about 229 [[gigawatts]]. About 45% of the FGD capacity was in the U.S., 24% in [[Germany]], 11% in Japan, and 20% in various other countries. Approximately 79% of the units, representing about 199 gigawatts of capacity, were using lime or limestone wet scrubbing. About 18% (or 25 gigawatts) utilized spray-dry scrubbers or sorbent injection systems.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;Nolan, Paul S., ''Flue Gas Desulfurization Technologies for Coal-Fired Power Plants'', The Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company, U.S., presented by Michael X.

==Sulfuric acid mist formation==
[[Fossil fuel]]s such as coal and oil can contain a significant amount of sulfur. When fossil fuels are burned, about 95 percent or more of the sulfur is generally converted to [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|SO|2}}). Such conversion happens under normal conditions of temperature and of oxygen present in the [[flue gas]]. However, there are circumstances under which such reaction may not occur.

When flue gas has too much oxygen, the {{chem|SO|2}} further oxidizes into [[sulfur trioxide]] ({{chem|SO|3}}). Too much oxygen is only one of the ways that {{chem|SO|3}} is formed. Gas temperature is also an important factor. At about 800&amp;nbsp;°C, formation of {{chem|SO|3}} is favored. Another way that {{chem|SO|3}} can be formed is through catalysis by metals in the fuel. Such reaction is particularly true for heavy fuel oil, where a significant amount of [[vanadium]] is present. In whatever way {{chem|SO|3}} is formed, it does not behave like {{chem|SO|2}} in that it forms a liquid [[aerosol]] known as [[sulfuric acid]] ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}) mist that is very difficult to remove. Generally, about 1% of the sulfur dioxide will be converted to {{chem|SO|3}}. Sulfuric acid mist is often the cause of the blue haze that often appears as the flue gas plume dissipates. Increasingly, this problem is being addressed by the use of wet [[electrostatic precipitator]]s.

== FGD chemistry ==

=== Basic principles ===
Most FGD systems employ two stages: one for [[fly ash]] removal and the other for {{chem|SO|2}} removal. Attempts have been made to remove both the fly ash and {{chem|SO|2}} in one scrubbing vessel. However, these systems experienced severe maintenance problems and low removal efficiency. In wet scrubbing systems, the flue gas normally passes first through a fly ash removal device, either an electrostatic precipitator or a baghouse, and then into the {{chem|SO|2}}-absorber. However, in dry injection or spray drying operations, the {{chem|SO|2}} is first reacted with the lime, and then the flue gas passes through a particulate control device.

Another important design consideration associated with wet FGD systems is that the flue gas exiting the absorber is saturated with water and still contains some {{chem|SO|2}}. These gases are highly corrosive to any downstream equipment such as fans, ducts, and stacks. Two methods that may minimize corrosion are: (1) reheating the gases to above their [[dew point]], or (2) using materials of construction and designs that allow equipment to withstand the corrosive conditions. Both alternatives are expensive. Engineers determine which method to use on a site-by-site basis.

=== Scrubbing with an alkali solid or solution ===
[[File:Flue gas desulfurization unit EN.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Schematic design of the absorber of an FGD]]
{{chem|SO|2}} is an [[acid gas]], and, therefore, the typical sorbent slurries or other materials used to remove the {{chem|SO|2}} from the flue gases are alkaline. The reaction taking place in wet scrubbing using a {{chem|CaCO|3}} ([[limestone]]) slurry produces [[calcium sulfite]] ({{chem|CaSO|3}}) and may be expressed in the simplified dry form as:

:{{chem|CaCO|3}}{{sub|(s)}} + {{chem|SO|2}}{{sub|(g)}} → {{chem|CaSO|3}}{{sub|(s)}} + {{CO2}}{{sub|(g)}}

When wet scrubbing with a Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[hydrated lime]]) slurry, the reaction also produces CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[calcium sulfite]]) and may be expressed in the simplified dry form as:

:Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(s)}} + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} → CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(s)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}}

When wet scrubbing with a Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[magnesium hydroxide]]) slurry, the reaction produces MgSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[magnesium sulfite]]) and may be expressed in the simplified dry form as:

:Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(s)}} + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} → MgSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(s)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}}

To partially offset the cost of the FGD installation, some designs, particularly dry sorbent injection systems, further oxidize the CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (calcium sulfite) to produce marketable CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ([[gypsum]]) that can be of high enough quality to use in [[wallboard]] and other products. The process by which this synthetic gypsum is created is also known as forced oxidation:

:CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(aq)}} + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}} + ½O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} → CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; · 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(s)}}

A natural alkaline usable to absorb SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is seawater. The {{chem|SO|2}} is absorbed in the water, and when oxygen is added reacts to form sulfate ions SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;- and free H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The surplus of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is offset by the carbonates in seawater pushing the carbonate equilibrium to release {{CO2}} gas:

:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}} + ½O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} → SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;{{sub|(aq)}} + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

:HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}} + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}}

In industry [[Caustic soda|caustic]] (NaOH) is often used to scrub {{chem|SO|2}}, producing [[sodium sulfite]]:

:2NaOH{{sub|(aq)}} + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(aq)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}}&lt;ref name="RJC"&gt;[http://rasayanjournal.co.in/vol-3/issue-2/23.pdf] REMOVAL OF SULPHUR DIOXIDE FROM FLUE GASES IN

==== Types of wet scrubbers used in FGD ====
To promote maximum [[Liquid-to-gas ratio|gas–liquid surface area]] and residence time, a number of wet scrubber designs have been used, including spray towers, venturis, plate towers, and mobile [[packed bed]]s. Because of scale buildup, plugging, or erosion, which affect FGD dependability and absorber efficiency, the trend is to use simple scrubbers such as spray towers instead of more complicated ones. The configuration of the tower may be vertical or horizontal, and flue gas can flow cocurrently, countercurrently, or crosscurrently with respect to the liquid. The chief drawback of spray towers is that they require a higher liquid-to-gas ratio requirement for equivalent {{chem|SO|2}} removal than other absorber designs.

FGD scrubbers produce a scaling wastewater that requires treatment to meet discharge regulations.&lt;ref name="EPA reg"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. [http://www2.epa.gov/eg/steam-electric-power-generating-effluent-guidelines-2015-final-rule "Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category."] Final Rule. 2015-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt; However, technological advancements in [[ion exchange membranes]] and [[electrodialysis]] systems has enabled high-efficiency treatment of FGD wastewater to meet recent EPA discharge limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lowering Cost and Waste in Flue Gas Desulfurization Wastewater Treatment|url=http://www.powermag.com/lowering-cost-waste-flue-gas-desulfurization-wastewater-treatment/|website=Power Mag|publisher=Electric Power|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment approach is similar for other highly scaling industrial wastewaters.

=====Venturi-rod scrubbers=====
{{main|venturi scrubber}}
A [[venturi scrubber]] is a converging/diverging section of duct. The converging section accelerates the gas stream to high velocity. When the liquid stream is injected at the throat, which is the point of maximum velocity, the turbulence caused by the high gas velocity atomizes the liquid into small droplets, which creates the surface area necessary for mass transfer to take place. The higher the pressure drop in the venturi, the smaller the droplets and the higher the surface area. The penalty is in power consumption.

For simultaneous removal of {{chem|SO|2}} and fly ash, venturi scrubbers can be used. In fact, many of the industrial sodium-based throwaway systems are venturi scrubbers originally designed to remove particulate matter. These units were slightly modified to inject a sodium-based scrubbing liquor. Although removal of both particles and {{chem|SO|2}} in one vessel can be economic, the problems of high pressure drops and finding a scrubbing medium to remove heavy loadings of fly ash must be considered. However, in cases where the particle concentration is low, such as from oil-fired units, it can be more effective to remove particulate and {{chem|SO|2}} simultaneously.

=====Packed bed scrubbers=====
A packed scrubber consists of a tower with packing material inside. This packing material can be in the shape of saddles, rings, or some highly specialized shapes designed to maximize the contact area between the dirty gas and liquid. Packed towers typically operate at much lower pressure drops than venturi scrubbers and are therefore cheaper to operate. They also typically offer higher {{chem|SO|2}} removal efficiency. The drawback is that they have a greater tendency to plug up if particles are present in excess in the exhaust air stream.

=====Spray towers=====
{{main|spray tower}}
A [[spray tower]] is the simplest type of scrubber. It consists of a tower with spray nozzles, which generate the droplets for surface contact. [[Spray tower]]s are typically used when circulating a slurry (see below). The high speed of a venturi would cause erosion problems, while a packed tower would plug up if it tried to circulate a slurry.

Counter-current packed towers are infrequently used because they have a tendency to become plugged by collected particles or to scale when [[lime (mineral)|lime]] or [[limestone]] scrubbing slurries are used.

==== Scrubbing reagent ====

As explained above, alkaline sorbents are used for scrubbing flue gases to remove SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Depending on the application, the two most important are [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] and [[sodium hydroxide]] (also known as [[caustic soda]]). Lime is typically used on large coal- or oil-fired boilers as found in power plants, as it is very much less expensive than caustic soda. The problem is that it results in a slurry being circulated through the scrubber instead of a solution. This makes it harder on the equipment. A spray tower is typically used for this application. The use of lime results in a slurry of calcium sulfite (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) that must be disposed of. Fortunately, calcium sulfite can be oxidized to produce by-product gypsum (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; · 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) which is marketable for use in the building products industry.

Caustic soda is limited to smaller combustion units because it is more expensive than lime, but it has the advantage that it forms a solution rather than a slurry. This makes it easier to operate. It produces a "[[spent caustic]]" solution of [[sodium sulfite]]/bisulfite (depending on the pH), or sodium sulfate that must be disposed of.  This is not a problem in a [[kraft pulp]] mill for example, where this can be a source of makeup chemicals to the recovery cycle.

=== Scrubbing with sodium sulfite solution ===

It is possible to scrub [[sulfur dioxide]] by using a cold solution of [[sodium sulfite]]; this forms a sodium hydrogen sulfite solution. By heating this solution it is possible to reverse the reaction to form sulfur dioxide and the sodium sulfite solution. Since the sodium sulfite solution is not consumed, it is called a regenerative treatment. The application of this reaction is also known as the [[Wellman–Lord process]].

In some ways this can be thought of as being similar to the reversible [[liquid–liquid extraction]] of an [[inert gas]] such as [[xenon]] or [[radon]] (or some other solute which does not undergo a chemical change during the extraction) from water to another phase. While a chemical change does occur during the extraction of the sulfur dioxide from the gas mixture, it is the case that the extraction equilibrium is shifted by changing the temperature rather than by the use of a chemical reagent.

=== Gas phase oxidation followed by reaction with ammonia ===

A new, emerging flue gas desulfurization technology has been described by the [[IAEA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-tc.iaea.org/tcweb/publications/factsheets/sheet16p.pdf IAEA Factsheet] about pilot plant in Poland.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[radiation]] technology where an intense beam of [[electrons]] is fired into the flue gas at the same time as [[ammonia]] is added to the gas. The Chendu power plant in China started up such a flue gas desulfurization unit on a 100 MW scale in 1998.  The Pomorzany power plant in Poland also started up a similar sized unit in 2003 and that plant removes both sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Both plants are reported to be operating successfully.&lt;ref name=Wu&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/36/116/36116306.pdf |chapter=Electron beam application in gas waste treatment in China |last1=Haifeng |first1=Wu |publisher=INET Tsinghua University |location=Beijing, China |title=Proceedings of the FNCA 2002 workshop on application of electron accelerator}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IAEA&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Reports/Anrep2003/physical.pdf Section of IAEA 2003 Annual Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221100739/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Reports/Anrep2003/physical.pdf |date=21 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the accelerator design principles and manufacturing quality need further improvement for continuous operation in industrial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ichtj.waw.pl/ichtj/nukleon/back/full/vol50_2005/v50s3p17f.pdf ''Application of ionizing radiation to environmental protection''] by A.G. Chmielewski, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland.&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[radioactivity]] is required or created in the process. The electron beam is generated by a device similar to the [[electron gun]] in a TV set. This device is called an accelerator. This is an example of a radiation chemistry process&lt;ref name=IAEA/&gt; where the physical effects of radiation are used to process a substance.

The action of the electron beam is to promote the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur(VI) compounds. The ammonia reacts with the sulfur compounds thus formed to produce [[ammonium sulfate]], which can be used as a nitrogenous [[fertilizer]]. In addition, it can be used to lower the nitrogen oxide content of the flue gas. This method has attained industrial plant scale.&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=20634234 ''Industrial Plant for Flue Gas Treatment with High Power Electron Accelerator''] by A.G. Chmielewski, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts and statistics==
:''The information in this section was obtained from a US EPA published fact sheet.''&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/catc/dir1/ffdg.pdf Air Pollution Control Fact Sheet] US EPA date coded 2003, accessed 24 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Flue gas desulfurization scrubbers have been applied to combustion units firing coal and oil that range in size from 5 MW to 1500 MW. [[Scottish Power]] are spending £400 million installing FGD at [[Longannet power station]], which has a capacity of over 2 GW. Dry scrubbers and spray scrubbers have generally been applied to units smaller than 300 MW.

FGD has been fitted by [[RWE npower]] at [[Aberthaw Power Station]] in south Wales using the seawater process and works successfully on the 1580MW plant.

Approximately 85% of the flue gas desulfurization units installed in the US are wet scrubbers, 12% are spray dry systems, and 3% are dry injection systems.

The highest {{chem|SO|2}} removal efficiencies (greater than 90%) are achieved by wet scrubbers and the lowest (less than 80%) by dry scrubbers. However, the newer designs for dry scrubbers are capable of achieving efficiencies in the order of 90%.

In spray drying and dry injection systems, the flue gas must first be cooled to about 10–20&amp;nbsp;°C above [[adiabatic]] [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturation]] to avoid wet solids deposition on downstream equipment and plugging of baghouses.

The capital, operating and maintenance costs per [[short ton]] of {{chem|SO|2}} removed (in 2001 US dollars) are:

*For wet scrubbers larger than 400 MW, the cost is $200 to $500 per ton
*For wet scrubbers smaller than 400 MW, the cost is $500 to $5,000 per ton
*For spray dry scrubbers larger than 200 MW, the cost is $150 to $300 per ton
*For spray dry scrubbers smaller than 200 MW, the cost is $500 to $4,000 per ton

== Alternative methods of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions==

An alternative to removing [[sulfur]] from the flue gases after burning is to remove the sulfur from the fuel before or during combustion.  [[Hydrodesulfurization]] of fuel has been used for treating [[fuel oil]]s before use.  [[Fluidized bed combustion]] adds lime to the fuel during combustion. The lime reacts with the SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form [[sulfate]]s which become part of the [[Coal assay#Ash|ash]].
This elemental sulfur is then separated and finally recovered at the end of the process for further usage in, for example, agricultural products. Safety is one of the greatest benefits of this method, as the whole process takes place at [[atmospheric pressure]] and ambient temperature. This method has been developed by Paqell, a joint venture between [[Shell Global Solutions]] and Paques.&lt;ref name=Paqell&gt;[http://paqell.com/thiopaq/process-description/ THIOPAQ Oil &amp; Gas process description and flow diagram] – official Paqell website&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''funerary cult''' is a body of [[anthropology of religion|religious]] teaching and practice centered on the [[veneration of the dead]], in which the living are thought to be able to confer benefits on the dead in the [[afterlife]] or to appease their otherwise wrathful [[ghost]]s. Rituals were carried on for the benefit of the dead, either by their relatives or by a class of [[priest]]s appointed and paid to perform the rites. These rituals took place at the [[tomb]]s of the dead themselves or at [[mortuary temple]]s appointed to this purpose. Funerary cults are found in a wide variety of cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Yayoi Shirai, "Ideal and reality in Old Kingdom private funerary cults", in ''The Old Kingdom Art and Archaeology'', Miroslav Bárta, ed.;  (Czech Institute of Egyptology, 2004), pp. [http://www.gizapyramids.org/pdf%20library/shirai_okaa_2006.pdf 325 et. seq.], accessed June 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cults==

===Egypt===
Funerary cults are especially associated with [[ancient Egypt]], where it was common for royalty, those associated with royalty, cats, and the wealthy to be mummified. This practice was done so as to preserve their bodies for the journey to the afterlife. The [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] [[Osiris]], who was the [[dying and reviving god]] and Lord of the Egyptian afterlife, was usually depicted as a [[mummy]] in [[Egyptian art]]. Also at [[Bubastis]], where Bast was worshiped, there was a massive cat cemetery. Cats were also thought to journey to the afterlife, usually to join their owners. These needed their own material goods for this journey, such as food.&lt;ref&gt;(p50 1910 encyclopedia  Britannica)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Empire===
The [[Roman Empire]] also had a funerary cult, revolving around Dionysus.  Dionysus, (along with being lord of wine and parties) had been reborn many times and had rescued his mother Semele from the Underworld (the Roman afterlife, ruled by Hades). Each [[Roman God]] had his or her own clique of devotees, and it was thought that Dionysus could protect his initiates from death. He was also one of the Gods associated with plants (grapes in particular) and harvest.  He was occasionally depicted in conjunction with other Gods (representatives of rebirth or plants of some kind) to indicate the dead also participated in the rejuvenation of the seasons.&lt;ref&gt;(The cults of the Roman Empire By Robert Turcan, p 312-313)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesopotamia===
In [[Sumer]], [[Assyria]], and [[Babylonia]], funerary cults were called ''kispu.'' This funerary cult mostly revolved around caring for deceased kin, with a specific family member assigned to providing for a specific ghost. The ghosts were provided with food and other goods, however the provision of clean water was of particular importance. Both deceased men and women were supposed to receive this care.  Without this care, the dead had the potential to become a malicious supernatural force.  With this care, the dead family continue to participate in the lives of the living family. Also, the practice of recycling the names of the deceased allowed for familial continuity. In Assyria, this was done by any consanguineal kin. A Babylonian variation of this cult treats the veneration of the dead as an extension of the veneration for parents. Offspring were responsible for this care. Scholar Miranda Bayliss had stated the function of this cult was to alleviate guilt and other tensions from the death of the deceased and form solidarity and continuity within the family. Typically only close kin received this care. When ancestors beyond the individual's grandparents were venerated, it was done at large gatherings of extended kin groups. This also functioned to promote solidarity within the larger kin group.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Bayliss, "The Cult of Dead Kin in Assyria and Babylonia", ''Iraq'', v. 35, no. 2. seq.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4199959]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bram Jagersma, "The Calendar of the Funerary Cult in Ancient Lagash", ''Bibliotheca Orientalis'', v.: 64 nos: 3-4, pp 289-307 [http://poj.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?id=2023945&amp;url=article]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
The ancient [[Greek hero cult]] was also a funerary cult; in the original sense, a ''[[hero]]'' was a deified or [[demigod|semi-divine]] ancestor, worshiped at a shrine for his power to assist the living. The ancient Greek religion had three main aspect: the Gods, the heroes, and the dead. The dead are powerless and the Gods all-powerful, while the heroes are dead (live only in legend and memory) and are powerful. Heroes occupy a liminal space between the Gods and mortals. Mortals sacrificed livestock and plants at Heroes' tombs to intervene and commune with the Gods on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;A companion to Greek Religion, by Daniel Ogden, p113-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''gastrovascular cavity''' is the primary organ of [[digestion]] and [[Circulatory system#Absence of circulatory system|circulation]] in two major animal phyla: the [[Cnidaria]] (including [[jellyfish]] and [[coral]]s) and [[Platyhelminthes]] (flatworms). The cavity may be extensively branched into a system of canals. In cnidarians, the gastrovascular system is also known as the '''coelenteron''', and is commonly known as a "blind gut" or "blind sac", since food enters and waste exits through the same orifice.

The [[Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]] cnidarians have a sac-like body in two distinct layers, the epidermis and [[gastrodermis]], with a jellylike layer called the [[mesoglea]] between. Extracellular digestion takes place within the central cavity of the sac-like body.  This cavity has only one opening to the outside which, in most cnidarians, is surrounded by [[tentacle]]s for capturing prey.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16697">'''Glycosylation''' (see also [[chemical glycosylation]]) is the reaction in which a [[carbohydrate]], i.e. a [[glycosyl donor]], is attached to a hydroxyl or other functional group of another molecule (a [[glycosyl acceptor]]). In biology, '''glycosylation''' mainly refers in particular to the enzymatic process that attaches [[glycans]] to [[glycoprotein|protein]]s, or other [[glycoside|organic molecules]]. This enzymatic process produces one of the fundamental [[biopolymers]] found in cells (along with [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[proteins]]). Glycosylation is a form of co-translational and [[post-translational modification]]. Glycans serve a variety of structural and functional roles in membrane and secreted proteins.&lt;ref name="varki"&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 2nd | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Press | isbn = 978-0-87969-770-9 | editor-first = Ajit | editor-last = Varki | name-list-format = vanc | title = Essentials of Glycobiology | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1908/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of proteins synthesized in the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] undergo glycosylation. It is an [[enzyme]]-directed site-specific process, as opposed to the non-enzymatic chemical reaction of [[glycation]]. Glycosylation is also present in the [[cytoplasm]] and nucleus as the ''O''-GlcNAc modification. Aglycosylation is a feature of engineered antibodies to bypass glycosylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jung ST, Kang TH, Kelton W, Georgiou G | title = Bypassing glycosylation: engineering aglycosylated full-length IgG antibodies for human therapy | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 858–67 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 21420850 | doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2011.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263802548_Transgenic_plants_of_Nicotiana_tabacum_L._express_aglycosylated_monoclonal_antibody_with_antitumor_activity|title=Transgenic plants of ''Nicotiana tabacum'' L. express aglycosylated monoclonal antibody with antitumor activity|year=2013|journal=Biotecnologia Aplicada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five classes of glycans are produced:
* ''N''-linked glycans attached to a [[nitrogen]] of [[asparagine]] or [[arginine]] [[Side chain|side-chains]]. [[N-linked glycosylation|''N''-linked glycosylation]] requires participation of a special lipid called dolichol phosphate. 
* ''O''-linked glycans attached to the [[hydroxyl]] [[oxygen]] of [[serine]], [[threonine]], [[tyrosine]], [[hydroxylysine]], or [[hydroxyproline]] side-chains, or to oxygens on lipids such as [[ceramide]]
* phosphoglycans linked through the phosphate of a phosphoserine;
*''C''-linked glycans, a rare form of glycosylation where a sugar is added to a carbon on a [[tryptophan]] side-chain
* [[glypiation]], which is the addition of a GPI anchor that links proteins to lipids through glycan linkages.

== Purpose ==
Glycosylation is the process by which a [[carbohydrate]] is [[covalent]]ly attached to a target [[macromolecule]], typically [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s.  This modification serves various functions.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 2nd | publisher = Oxford University Press, USA | isbn = 978-0-19-928278-4 | vauthors = Drickamer K, Taylor ME | title = Introduction to Glycobiology | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, some proteins do not fold correctly unless they are glycosylated.&lt;ref name="varki"/&gt;  In other cases, proteins are not stable unless they contain [[oligosaccharide]]s linked at the [[amide]] [[nitrogen]] of certain [[asparagine]] residues. The influence of glycosylation on the folding and stability of glycoprotein is twofold. Firstly, the highly soluble glycans may have a direct physicochemical stabilisation effect. Secondly, ''N''-linked glycans mediate a critical quality control check point in glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dalziel M, Crispin M, Scanlan CN, Zitzmann N, Dwek RA | title = Emerging principles for the therapeutic exploitation of glycosylation | journal = Science | volume = 343 | issue = 6166 | pages = 1235681 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24385630 | doi = 10.1126/science.1235681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glycosylation also plays a role in cell-to-cell adhesion (a mechanism employed by cells of the [[immune system]]) via sugar-binding proteins called [[lectins]], which recognize specific carbohydrate moieties.&lt;ref name="varki"/&gt; Glycosylation is an important parameter in the optimization of many glycoprotein-based drugs such as [[monoclonal antibodies]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Glycosylation also underpins the [[ABO blood group]] system. It is the presence or absence of [[glycosyltransferase]]s which dictates which blood group [[antigen]]s are presented and hence what antibody specificities are exhibited. This immunological role may well have driven the diversification of glycan heterogeneity and creates a barrier to [[zoonotic]] transmission of viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crispin M, Harvey DJ, Bitto D, Bonomelli C, Edgeworth M, Scrivens JH, Huiskonen JT, Bowden TA | title = Structural plasticity of the Semliki Forest virus glycome upon interspecies transmission | language = EN | journal = Journal of Proteome Research | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 1702–12 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24467287 | pmc = 4428802 | doi = 10.1021/pr401162k | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr401162k }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, glycosylation is often used by viruses to shield the underlying viral protein from immune recognition. A significant example is the dense glycan shield of the envelope spike of the [[human immunodeficiency virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crispin M, Doores KJ | title = Targeting host-derived glycans on enveloped viruses for antibody-based vaccine design | journal = Current Opinion in Virology | volume = 11 | pages = 63–9 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25747313 | pmc = 4827424 | doi = 10.1016/j.coviro.2015.02.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625715000267 | series = Viral pathogenesis • Preventive and therapeutic vaccines }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, glycosylation needs to be understood by the likely evolutionary selection pressures that have shaped it. In one model, diversification can be considered purely as a result of endogenous functionality (such as [[cell trafficking]]). However, it is more likely that diversification is driven by evasion of pathogen infection mechanism (e.g. ''[[Helicobacter]]'' attachment to terminal saccharide residues) and that diversity within the multicellular organism is then exploited endogenously.

==Glycoprotein diversity==

Glycosylation increases diversity in the [[proteome]], because almost every aspect of glycosylation can be modified, including:
*[[Glycosidic bond]]—the site of glycan linkage
*Glycan composition—the types of sugars that are linked to a given protein
*Glycan structure—can be unbranched or branched chains of sugars
*Glycan length—can be short- or long-chain oligosaccharides

== Mechanisms ==

There are various mechanisms for glycosylation, although most share several common features:&lt;ref name="varki"/&gt;
*Glycosylation, unlike [[glycation]], is an enzymatic process. Indeed, glycosylation is thought to be the most complex [[Posttranslational modification|post-translational modification]], because of the large number of enzymatic steps involved.&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Roberts and Co. Publishers, Englewood, CO | isbn = 0974707732 | last = Walsh | first = Christopher |  name-list-format = vanc |title = Posttranslational Modification of Proteins: Expanding Nature's Inventory | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The donor molecule is often an activated [[nucleotide sugar]].
*The process is non-templated (unlike DNA [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] or protein [[Translation (biology)|translation]]); instead, the cell relies on segregating enzymes into different cellular compartments (e.g., [[endoplasmic reticulum]], cisternae in [[Golgi apparatus]]). Therefore, glycosylation is a site-specific modification.

== Types ==

=== ''N''-linked glycosylation ===
{{main article|N-linked glycosylation}}
''N''-linked glycosylation is a very prevalent form of glycosylation and is important for the folding of many eukaryotic glycoproteins and for cell&amp;ndash;cell and cell&amp;ndash;[[extracellular matrix]] attachment. The ''N''-linked glycosylation process occurs in [[eukaryotes]] in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and widely in [[archaea]], but very rarely in [[bacteria]].  In addition to their function in protein folding and cellular attachment, the ''N''-linked glycans of a protein can modulate a protein's function, in some cases acting as an on/off switch.&lt;ref name = "immune_glycan"/&gt;

=== ''O''-linked glycosylation ===
{{main article|O-linked glycosylation}}
''O''-linked glycosylation is a form of glycosylation that occurs in [[eukaryotes]] in the [[Golgi apparatus]],&lt;ref name="Flynne2008"&gt;{{cite book|first=William G. |last=Flynne | name-list-format = vanc | title=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WEBBP5IYqJQC&amp;pg=PA45|access-date=13 November 2010|year=2008|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-60456-067-1|pages=45ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also occurs in [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]].

=== Phosphoserine glycosylation ===
[[Xylose]], [[fucose]], [[mannose]], and [[GlcNAc]] [[phosphoserine]] [[glycan]]s have been reported in the literature.  Fucose and GlcNAc have been found only in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'', mannose in ''[[Leishmania mexicana]]'', and xylose in ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]''.  Mannose has recently been reported in a vertebrate, the mouse, ''Mus musculus'', on the cell-surface laminin receptor alpha dystroglycan&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. It has been suggested this rare finding may be linked to the fact that alpha dystroglycan is highly conserved from lower vertebrates to mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoshida-Moriguchi T, Yu L, Stalnaker SH, Davis S, Kunz S, Madson M, Oldstone MB, Schachter H, Wells L, Campbell KP | title = O-mannosyl phosphorylation of alpha-dystroglycan is required for laminin binding | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5961 | pages = 88–92 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20044576 | pmc = 2978000 | doi = 10.1126/science.1180512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''C''-mannosylation ===
A [[mannose]] sugar is added to the first [[tryptophan]] residue in the sequence W&amp;ndash;X&amp;ndash;X&amp;ndash;W (W indicates tryptophan; X is any amino acid).  [[Thrombospondins]] are one of the most commonly ''C''-modified proteins, although this form of glycosylation appears elsewhere as well. ''C''-mannosylation is unusual because the sugar is linked to a [[carbon]] rather than a reactive atom such as [[nitrogen]] or [[oxygen]]. Recently,{{when|date=January 2018}} the first crystal structure of a protein containing this type of glycosylation has been determined—that of human complement component 8, {{PDB|3OJY}}.

=== Formation of GPI anchors (glypiation) ===
(Main Article:[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glypiation|Glypiation]])
A special form of glycosylation is the formation of a [[GPI anchor]]. In this kind of glycosylation a protein is attached to a lipid anchor, via a glycan chain. (See also [[prenylation]].)

=== Chemical glycosylation ===
Glycosylation can also be effected using the tools of [[synthetic organic chemistry]].  Unlike the biochemical processes, synthetic glycochemistry relies heavily on protecting groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crich D | title = Mechanism of a chemical glycosylation reaction | journal = Accounts of Chemical Research | volume = 43 | issue = 8 | pages = 1144–53 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20496888 | doi = 10.1021/ar100035r }}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. the 4,6-O-benzylidene) in order to achieve desired regioselectivity. The other challenge of chemical glycosylation is the stereoselectivity that each glycosidic linkage has two stereo-outcomes, alpha-/beta or cis-/trans. Generally, the alpha- or cis- glycoside is more challenging to synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nigudkar SS, Demchenko AV | title = cis glycosylation as the driving force of progress in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry | journal = Chemical Science | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 2687–2704 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 26078847 | pmc = 4465199 | doi = 10.1039/c5sc00280j | url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C5SC00280J }}&lt;/ref&gt; New methods have been developed based on solvent participation or the formation of bicyclic sulfonium ions as chiral-auxiliary groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fang T, Gu Y, Huang W, Boons GJ | title = Mechanism of Glycosylation of Anomeric Sulfonium Ions | language = EN | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 138 | issue = 9 | pages = 3002–11 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26878147 | pmc = 5078750 | doi = 10.1021/jacs.5b08436 | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5b08436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Clinical==
Over 40 [[congenital disorder of glycosylation|disorders of glycosylation]] have been reported in humans.&lt;ref name=Jaeken2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaeken J | title = Congenital disorders of glycosylation | journal = Handbook of Clinical Neurology | volume = 113 | issue =  | pages = 1737–43 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23622397 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-444-59565-2.00044-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be divided into four groups: disorders of protein [[N-linked glycosylation|''N''-glycosylation]], disorders of protein ''O''-glycosylation, disorders of lipid glycosylation and disorders of other glycosylation pathways and of multiple glycosylation pathways. No effective treatment is known for any of these disorders. 80% of these affect the nervous system.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

=== Effects on therapeutic efficacy ===
It has been reported that mammalian glycosylation can improve the therapeutic efficacy of [[biotherapeutic]]s. For example, therapeutic efficacy of recombinant [[Interferon gamma|human interferon gamma]], expressed in [[HEK 293 cells|HEK&amp;nbsp;293]] platform, was improved against drug-resistant [[ovarian cancer]] cell lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Razaghi A, Villacrés C, Jung V, Mashkour N, Butler M, Owens L, Heimann K | title = Improved therapeutic efficacy of mammalian expressed-recombinant interferon gamma against ovarian cancer cells | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 359 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–29 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28803068 | doi = 10.1016/j.yexcr.2017.08.014 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2017.08.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fibonacci spiral 34.svg|thumb|right|The golden spiral is calculated by tiling the square of [[Fibonacci number]]s, which are related by the golden ratio.]]

In [[mathematics]], two quantities are in the '''golden ratio''' if their [[ratio]] is the same as the ratio of their [[summation|sum]] to the larger of the two quantities. The figure on the right illustrates the geometric relationship. The golden ratio is also called the '''golden mean''' or '''golden section''' (Latin: ''sectio aurea'').{{sfn|Livio|2003|pp=3, 81}}&lt;ref name="Sadowski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dunlap"&gt;Richard A Dunlap, ''The Golden Ratio and Fibonacci Numbers'', World Scientific Publishing, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Other names include '''extreme and mean ratio''',&lt;ref name="Elements 6.3"&gt;Euclid, ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', [https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVI/defVI3.html Book 6, Definition 3].&lt;/ref&gt; '''medial section''', '''divine proportion''', '''divine section''' (Latin: ''sectio divina''), '''golden proportion''', '''golden cut''',&lt;ref&gt;Summerson John, ''Heavenly Mansions: And Other Essays on Architecture'' (New York: W.W. Norton, 1963) p.&amp;nbsp;37. "And the same applies in architecture, to the [[rectangle]]s representing these and other ratios (e.g. the 'golden cut'). The sole value of these ratios is that they are intellectually fruitful and suggest the rhythms of modular design."&lt;/ref&gt; and '''golden number'''.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Hambidge, ''Dynamic Symmetry: The Greek Vase'', New Haven CT: Yale University Press, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Lidwell, Kritina Holden, Jill Butler, ''Universal Principles of Design: A Cross-Disciplinary Reference'', Gloucester MA: Rockport Publishers, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pacioli"&gt;Pacioli, Luca.

[[Mathematician]]s since [[Euclid]] have studied the properties of the golden ratio, including its appearance in the dimensions of a [[regular pentagon]] and in a golden rectangle, which may be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with the same [[aspect ratio]]. The golden ratio has also been used to analyze the proportions of natural objects as well as man-made systems such as [[financial market]]s, in some cases based on dubious fits to data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Steven|last=Strogatz|authorlink=Steven Strogatz|title=Me, Myself, and Math: Proportion Control|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 24, 2012|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/proportion-control/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden ratio appears in some [[patterns in nature]], including the [[phyllotaxis|spiral arrangement of leaves]] and other plant parts.

Some twentieth-century [[artist]]s and [[architect]]s, including [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Salvador Dalí]], have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio—especially in the form of the [[golden rectangle]], in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio—believing this proportion to be [[aesthetics|aesthetically]] pleasing.

==History==
{{further|Fibonacci number#Origins}}

The golden ratio has a wide range of demonstrations throughout history. According to [[Mario Livio]]:
{{quote|Some of the greatest mathematical minds of all ages, from [[Pythagoras]] and [[Euclid]] in [[ancient Greece]], through the medieval Italian mathematician &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Fibonacci]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the Renaissance astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]], to present-day scientific figures such as Oxford physicist [[Roger Penrose]], have spent endless hours over this simple ratio and its properties. ... it is probably fair to say that the Golden Ratio has inspired thinkers of all disciplines like no other number in the history of mathematics.{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=6}}}}

[[File:Pentagram-phi.svg|right|thumb|A pentagram colored to distinguish its line segments of different lengths. The four

==Applications and observations==

===Aesthetics===
{{See also|History of aesthetics (pre-20th-century)|Mathematics and art}}

''De Divina Proportione'', a three-volume work by [[Luca Pacioli]], was published in 1509. Pacioli, a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]], was known mostly as a mathematician, but he was also trained and keenly interested in art. ''De Divina Proportione'' explored the mathematics of the golden ratio. Though it is often said that Pacioli advocated the golden ratio's application to yield pleasing, harmonious proportions, Livio points out that the interpretation has been traced to an error in 1799, and that Pacioli actually advocated the [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] system of rational proportions.{{sfn|Livio|2003|pp=134-35}} Pacioli also saw Catholic religious significance in the ratio, which led to his work's title. ''De Divina Proportione'' contains illustrations of regular solids by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], Pacioli's longtime friend and collaborator; these are not directly linked to the golden ratio.

[[File:7234014 Parthenonas (cropped).jpg|thumb|x150px|right|Many of the proportions of the [[Parthenon]] are alleged to exhibit the golden ratio.]]

The [[Parthenon]]'s façade as well as elements of its façade are said by some to be circumscribed by golden rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., "Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis with a Philosophical Polemic", ''Communication Quarterly'', Vol. 46 No. 2, 1998, pp 194–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars deny that the Greeks had any aesthetic association with the golden ratio. For example, Midhat J. Gazalé says, "It was not until Euclid, however, that the golden ratio's mathematical properties were studied. In the ''Elements'' (308&amp;nbsp;BC) the Greek mathematician merely regarded that number as an interesting irrational number, in connection with the middle and extreme ratios. Its occurrence in regular pentagons and [[decagon]]s was duly observed, as well as in the [[dodecahedron]]".&lt;ref&gt;Midhat J. Gazalé , ''Gnomon'', Princeton University Press, 1999. {{isbn|0-691-00514-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Keith Devlin]] says, "Certainly, the oft repeated assertion that the Parthenon in Athens is based on the golden ratio is not supported by actual measurements. In fact, the entire story about the Greeks and golden ratio seems to be without foundation. The one thing we know for sure is that Euclid, in his famous textbook ''Elements'', written around 300&amp;nbsp;BC, showed how to calculate its value."&lt;ref&gt;Keith J. Devlin ''The Math Instinct: Why You're A Mathematical Genius (Along With Lobsters, Birds, Cats, And Dogs)'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=eRD9gYk2r6oC&amp;pg=PA108 p.&amp;nbsp;108]. New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 2005, {{isbn|1-56025-672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later sources like [[Vitruvius]] exclusively discuss proportions that can be expressed in whole numbers, i.e. commensurate as opposed to irrational proportions. One researcher concluded that the golden ratio was totally absent from Greek architecture of the classical fifth century&amp;nbsp;BC, and almost absent during the following six centuries, based on measurements of 15 temples, 18 monumental tombs, 8 sarcophagi, and 58 grave stelae.&lt;ref&gt;Patrice Foutakis, "Did the Greeks Build According to the Golden Ratio?", ''Cambridge Archaeological Journal'', vol. 24, n° 1, February 2014, pp.&amp;nbsp;71–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent book, author Jason Elliot speculated that the golden ratio was used by the designers of the [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]] and the adjacent Lotfollah mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Jason Elliot | title = Mirrors of the Unseen: Journeys in Iran | year = 2006 | pages = 277, 284 | publisher = Macmillan | isbn = 978-0-312-30191-0 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Gcs4IjUx3-4C&amp;pg=PA284}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 geometrical analysis of earlier research into the [[Mosque of Oqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] reveals a consistent application of the golden ratio throughout the design, according to Boussora and Mazouz.&lt;ref&gt;Boussora, Kenza and Mazouz, Said, ''The Use of the Golden Section in the Great Mosque of Kairouan'', Nexus Network Journal, vol. 6 no. 1 (Spring 2004), [http://www.emis.de/journals/NNJ/BouMaz.html]&lt;/ref&gt; They found ratios close to the golden ratio in the overall proportion of the plan and in the dimensioning of the prayer space, the court, and the [[minaret]]. The authors note, however, that the areas where ratios close to the golden ratio were found are not part of the original construction, and theorize that these elements were added in a reconstruction.

The Swiss [[architect]] [[Le Corbusier]], famous for his contributions to the [[modernism|modern]] [[International Style (architecture)|international style]], centered his design philosophy on systems of harmony and proportion. Le Corbusier's faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden ratio and the Fibonacci series, which he described as "rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages and the learned."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'' p.&amp;nbsp;25, as cited in Padovan, Richard, ''Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture'' (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;316, Taylor and Francis, {{isbn|0-419-22780-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Frings: The Golden Section in Architectural Theory, Nexus Network Journal vol. 4 no. 1 (Winter 2002), available online [http://belveduto.de/text-nnj.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|Leonardo da Vinci's ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'']]
Le Corbusier explicitly used the golden ratio in his [[Modulor]] system for the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[Proportion (architecture)|architectural proportion]]. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of Vitruvius, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of [[architecture]]. In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier based the system on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], [[Fibonacci number]]s, and the double unit. He took suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the [[Modulor]] system. Le Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in [[Garches]] exemplified the Modulor system's application. The villa's rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'', p.&amp;nbsp;35, as cited in Padovan, Richard, ''Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture'' (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;320. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{isbn|0-419-22780-6}}: "Both the paintings and the architectural designs make use of the golden section".&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Swiss architect, [[Mario Botta]], bases many of his designs on geometric figures. Several private houses he designed in Switzerland are composed of squares and circles, cubes and cylinders. In a house he designed in [[Origlio]], the golden ratio is the proportion between the central section and the side sections of the house.&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, Simon.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a time when deviations from the truly beautiful page proportions 2:3, 1:√3, and the Golden Section were rare. Many books produced between 1550 and 1770 show these proportions exactly, to within half a millimeter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Design===
Some sources claim that the golden ratio is commonly used in everyday design, for example in the shapes of postcards, playing cards, posters, wide-screen televisions, photographs, light switch plates and cars.&lt;ref&gt;

===Music===
[[Ernő Lendvai]] analyzes [[Béla Bartók]]'s works as being based on two opposing systems, that of the golden ratio and the [[acoustic scale]],&lt;ref&gt;Lendvai, Ernő (1971). ''Béla Bartók: An Analysis of His Music''. London: Kahn and Averill.&lt;/ref&gt; though other music scholars reject that analysis.{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=190}} French composer [[Erik Satie]] used the golden ratio in several of his pieces, including ''[[Sonneries de la Rose+Croix]]''. The golden ratio is also apparent in the organization of the sections in the music of [[Debussy]]'s ''[[Reflets dans l'eau]] (Reflections in Water)'', from ''Images'' (1st series, 1905), in which "the sequence of keys is marked out by the intervals 34, 21, 13 and 8, and the main climax sits at the phi position".&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Peter F.

[[Adolf Zeising]], whose main interests were mathematics and philosophy, found the golden ratio expressed in the [[phyllotaxis|arrangement of parts]] such as leaves and branches along the stems of plants and of [[Leaf#Veins|veins]] in leaves. He extended his research to the [[skeleton]]s of animals and the branchings of their veins and nerves, to the proportions of chemical compounds and the geometry of [[crystal]]s, even to the use of proportion in artistic endeavors. In these [[patterns in nature]] he saw the golden ratio operating as a universal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Proportion

Since 1991, several researchers have proposed connections between the golden ratio and [[human genome]] [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Perez (1991), [http://golden-ratio-in-dna.blogspot.com/2008/01/1991-first-publication-related-to.html "Chaos DNA and Neuro-computers: A Golden Link"], in ''Speculations in Science and Technology'' vol. 14 no. 4, {{ISSN|0155-7785}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamagishi, Michel E.B., and Shimabukuro, Alex I.

However, some have argued that many apparent manifestations of the golden ratio in nature, especially in regard to animal dimensions, are fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;Pommersheim, James E., Tim K. Marks, and [[Erica Flapan|Erica L. Flapan]], eds. 2010. "Number Theory: A Lively Introduction with Proofs, Applications, and Stories". John Wiley and Sons: 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceptual studies===
Studies by psychologists, starting with [[Gustav Fechner]], have been devised to test the idea that the golden ratio plays a role in human perception of [[beauty]]. While Fechner found a preference for rectangle ratios centered on the golden ratio, later attempts to test such a hypothesis have been inconclusive.{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=7}}&lt;ref name=livio/&gt;

===Disputed observations===
Examples of disputed observations of the golden ratio include the following:
*Historian [[John Man (author)|John Man]] states that the pages of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] were "based on the golden section shape". However, according to Man's own measurements, the ratio of height to width was 1.45.&lt;ref&gt;Man, John, ''Gutenberg: How One Man Remade the World with Word'' (2002) pp. 166–167, Wiley, {{isbn|0-471-21823-5}}. "The half-folio page (30.7 × 44.5 cm) was made up of two rectangles—the whole page and its text area—based on the so called 'golden section', which specifies a crucial relationship between short and long sides, and produces an irrational number, as pi is, but is a ratio of about 5:8."&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some specific proportions in the bodies of many animals (including humans)&lt;ref name=pheasant&gt;{{Cite book |first=Stephen |last=Pheasant |title=Bodyspace |location=London |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1998 |isbn=0-7484-0067-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanLaack&gt;{{Cite book |first=Walter |last=van Laack |title=A Better History Of Our World: Volume 1 The Universe |location=Aachen |publisher=van Laach GmbH |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and parts of the shells of mollusks&lt;ref name="dunlap"/&gt; are often claimed to be in the golden ratio. There is a large variation in the real measures of these elements in specific individuals, however, and the proportion in question is often significantly different from the golden ratio.&lt;ref name=pheasant/&gt; The ratio of successive phalangeal bones of the digits and the metacarpal bone has been said to approximate the golden ratio.&lt;ref name=vanLaack/&gt; The [[nautilus]] shell, the construction of which proceeds in a [[logarithmic spiral]], is often cited, usually with the idea that any logarithmic spiral is related to the golden ratio, but sometimes with the claim that each new chamber is proportioned by the golden ratio relative to the previous one;&lt;ref name=moscovich&gt;[[Ivan Moscovich]], ''Ivan Moscovich Mastermind Collection: The Hinged Square &amp; Other Puzzles,'' New York: Sterling, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; however, measurements of nautilus shells do not support this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Sea shell spirals|last=Peterson|first=Ivars|journal=Science News|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/6030/title/Sea_Shell_Spirals}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In investing, some practitioners of [[technical analysis]] use the golden ratio to indicate support of a price level, or resistance to price increases, of a stock or commodity; after significant price changes up or down, new support and resistance levels are supposedly found at or near prices related to the starting price via the golden ratio.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Osler writes that "38.2 percent and 61.8 percent retracements of recent rises or declines are common," in {{Cite journal|author=Osler, Carol|title=Support for Resistance: Technical Analysis and Intraday Exchange Rates|journal=Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review|year=2000|volume=6|issue=2|pages= 53–68| url=http://ftp.ny.frb.org/research/epr/00v06n2/0007osle.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the golden ratio in investing is also related to more complicated patterns described by [[Fibonacci numbers]] (e.g. [[Elliott wave principle]] and [[Fibonacci retracement]]).  However, other market analysts have published analyses suggesting that these percentages and patterns are not supported by the data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roy Batchelor]] and Richard Ramyar, "[https://www.webcitation.org/5reh6NujR?url=http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/media/stories/resources/Magic_Numbers_in_the_Dow.pdf Magic numbers in the Dow]," 25th International Symposium on Forecasting, 2005, p.  13, 31.

====Pyramids====
[[File:Mathematical Pyramid.svg|right|thumb|250px|A regular square pyramid is determined by its medial right triangle, whose edges are the pyramid's apothem (a), semi-base (b), and height (h); the face inclination angle is also marked. Mathematical proportions b:h:a of &lt;math&gt;1:\sqrt{\varphi}:\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3:4:5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1:4/\pi:1.61899&lt;/math&gt; are of particular interest in relation to Egyptian pyramids.]]
Both Egyptian pyramids and the regular [[square pyramid]]s that resemble them can be analyzed with respect to the golden ratio and other ratios.

=====Mathematical pyramids and triangles=====
A pyramid in which the apothem (slant height along the bisector of a face) is equal to {{φ}} times the semi-base (half the base width) is sometimes called a ''golden pyramid''. The isosceles triangle that is the face of such a pyramid can be constructed from the two halves of a diagonally split golden rectangle (of size semi-base by apothem), joining the medium-length edges to make the apothem. The height of this pyramid is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; times the semi-base (that is, the slope of the face is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;); the square of the height is equal to the area of a face, {{φ}} times the square of the semi-base.

The medial [[right triangle]] of this "golden" pyramid (see diagram), with sides &lt;math&gt;1:\sqrt{\varphi}:\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is interesting in its own right, demonstrating via the [[Pythagorean theorem]] the relationship &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi} = \sqrt{\varphi^2 - 1}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\varphi = \sqrt{1 + \varphi}&lt;/math&gt;. This [[Kepler triangle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Best of Astraea: 17 Articles on Science, History and Philosophy | url = https://books.google.com/?id=LDTPvbXLxgQC&amp;pg=PA93 | publisher = Astrea Web Radio | isbn = 1-4259-7040-0 | year = 2006 | author1 = Radio, Astraea Web }}&lt;/ref&gt;
is the only right triangle proportion with edge lengths in [[geometric progression]],&lt;ref name=herz&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Shape of the Great Pyramid | author = Roger Herz-Fischler | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-88920-324-5 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=066T3YLuhA0C&amp;pg=PA81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; just as the 3–4–5 triangle is the only right triangle proportion with edge lengths in [[arithmetic progression]]. The angle with tangent &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the angle that the side of the pyramid makes with respect to the ground, 51.827... degrees (51° 49' 38").&lt;ref&gt;Midhat Gazale, ''Gnomon: From Pharaohs to Fractals'', Princeton Univ. Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

A nearly similar pyramid shape, but with rational proportions, is described in the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] (the source of a large part of modern knowledge of ancient [[Egyptian mathematics]]), based on the 3:4:5 triangle;&lt;ref name = "maor"/&gt; the face slope corresponding to the angle with tangent 4/3 is 53.13 degrees (53 degrees and 8 minutes).&lt;ref name=Herkommer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petrospec-technologies.com/Herkommer/pyramid/pyramid.htm |title=The Great Pyramid, The Great Discovery, and The Great Coincidence |accessdate=2007-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194148/http://www.petrospec-technologies.com/Herkommer/pyramid/pyramid.htm |archivedate=2014-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The slant height or apothem is 5/3 or 1.666... times the semi-base. The Rhind papyrus has another pyramid problem as well, again with rational slope (expressed as run over rise). Egyptian mathematics did not include the notion of irrational numbers,&lt;ref&gt;Lancelot Hogben, ''Mathematics for the Million'', London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1942, p.&amp;nbsp;63., as cited by Dick Teresi, ''Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science—from the Babylonians to the Maya'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2003, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; and the rational inverse slope (run/rise, multiplied by a factor of 7 to convert to their conventional units of palms per cubit) was used in the building of pyramids.&lt;ref name = "maor"/&gt;

Another mathematical pyramid with proportions almost identical to the "golden" one is the one with perimeter equal to 2{{pi}} times the height, or h:b = 4:{{pi}}. This triangle has a face angle of 51.854° (51°51'), very close to the 51.827° of the Kepler triangle. This pyramid relationship corresponds to the [[mathematical coincidences|coincidental relationship]] &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi} \approx 4/\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

Egyptian pyramids very close in proportion to these mathematical pyramids are known.&lt;ref name=Herkommer/&gt;

=====Egyptian pyramids=====
In the mid-nineteenth century, Röber studied various Egyptian pyramids including Khafre, Menkaure and some of the Giza, Sakkara, and Abusir groups, and was interpreted as saying that half the base of the side of the pyramid is the middle mean of the side, forming what other authors identified as the Kepler triangle; many other mathematical theories of the shape of the pyramids have also been explored.&lt;ref name=herz/&gt;

One Egyptian pyramid is remarkably close to a "golden pyramid"—the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu). Its slope of 51° 52' is extremely close to the "golden" pyramid inclination of 51° 50' and the {{pi}}-based pyramid inclination of 51° 51'; other pyramids at Giza (Chephren, 52° 20', and Mycerinus, 50° 47')&lt;ref name="maor"&gt;[[Eli Maor]], ''Trigonometric Delights'', Princeton Univ. Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; are also quite close. Whether the relationship to the golden ratio in these pyramids is by design or by accident remains open to speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Adding fuel to controversy over the architectural authorship of the Great Pyramid, [[Eric Temple Bell]], mathematician and historian, claimed in 1950 that Egyptian mathematics would not have supported the ability to calculate the slant height of the pyramids, or the ratio to the height, except in the case of the 3:4:5 pyramid, since the 3:4:5 triangle was the only right triangle known to the Egyptians and they did not know the Pythagorean theorem, nor any way to reason about irrationals such as {{pi}} or {{φ}}.{{Disputed inline|Egyptian Pyramids|date=November 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bell |first=Eric Temple |title=The Development of Mathematics |location=New York |publisher=Dover |year=1940 |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_5KAnw3QMC8C&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Rice&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Michael, ''Egypt's Legacy: The Archetypes of Western Civilisation, 3000 to 30 B.C'' pp. 24 Routledge, 2003, {{isbn|0-415-26876-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that principal authorities on the history of [[Egyptian architecture]] have argued that the Egyptians were well acquainted with the golden ratio and that it is part of mathematics of the Pyramids, citing Giedon (1957).&lt;ref&gt;S. Giedon, 1957, The Beginnings of Architecture, The A.W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts, 457, as cited in Rice, Michael, ''Egypt's Legacy: The Archetypes of Western Civilisation, 3000 to 30 B.C'' pp.24 Routledge, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Historians of science have always debated whether the Egyptians had any such knowledge or not, contending rather that its appearance in an Egyptian building is the result of chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Markowsky | first = George | date = January 1992 | title = Misconceptions about the Golden Ratio | journal = College Mathematics Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | doi = 10.2307/2686193 | url = http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = | jstor = 2686193 | publisher = Mathematical Association of America | pages = 2–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, the [[Pyramidology|pyramidologist]] [[John Taylor (1781–1864)|John Taylor]] claimed that, in the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], the golden ratio is represented by the ratio of the length of the face (the slope height), inclined at an angle [[θ]] to the ground, to half the length of the side of the square base, equivalent to the [[Cosecant|secant]] of the angle θ.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''The Great Pyramid: Why Was It Built and Who Built It?'', 1859&lt;/ref&gt; The above two lengths were about 186.4 and 115.2 meters respectively. The ratio of these lengths is the golden ratio, accurate to more digits than either of the original measurements. Similarly, [[Richard William Howard Vyse|Howard Vyse]], according to Matila Ghyka,&lt;ref&gt;Matila Ghyka ''The Geometry of Art and Life'', New York: Dover, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; reported the great pyramid height 148.2 m, and half-base 116.4 m, yielding 1.6189 for the ratio of slant height to half-base, again more accurate than the data variability.

==Mathematics==
Usually, the lowercase form of phi (φ or {{math|''φ''}}) is used to symbolize the golden ratio. Sometimes the uppercase form (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;) is used for the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of the golden ratio, 1/{{math|''φ''}}.&lt;ref name="MathWorld GR Conjugate"/&gt;

Two quantities ''a'' and ''b'' are said to be in the ''golden ratio'' {{math|''φ''}} if

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a+b}{a} = \frac{a}{b} = \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

One method for finding the value of {{math|''φ''}} is to start with the left fraction. Through simplifying the fraction and substituting in b/a = 1/{{math|''φ''}},

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a+b}{a} = \frac{a}{a}+\frac{b}{a} = 1 + \frac{b}{a} = 1 + \frac{1}{\varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt; 1 + \frac{1}{\varphi} = \varphi. &lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by {{math|''φ''}} gives

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi + 1 = \varphi^2&lt;/math&gt;

which can be rearranged to

:&lt;math&gt;{\varphi}^2 - \varphi - 1 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[quadratic formula]], two solutions are obtained:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.61803\,39887\dots&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = -0.6180\,339887\dots&lt;/math&gt;

Because {{math|''φ''}} is the ratio between positive quantities {{math|''φ''}} is necessarily positive:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.61803\,39887\dots&lt;/math&gt; .

The golden ratio is an [[irrational number]]. Below are two short proofs of irrationality:

====Contradiction from an expression in lowest terms====
[[File:Whirling squares.svg|thumb|right|If &amp;phi; were [[Rational number|rational]], then it would be the ratio of sides of a rectangle with integer sides (the rectangle comprising the entire diagram). But it would also be a ratio of integer sides of the smaller rectangle (the rightmost portion of the diagram) obtained by deleting a square. The sequence of decreasing integer side lengths formed by deleting squares cannot be continued indefinitely because the integers have a lower bound, so &amp;phi; cannot be rational.]]

Recall that:

: the whole is the longer part plus the shorter part;
: the whole is to the longer part as the longer part is to the shorter part.

If we call the whole ''n'' and the longer part ''m'', then the second statement above becomes

: ''n'' is to ''m'' as ''m'' is to ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'',

or, algebraically

: &lt;math&gt; \frac nm = \frac{m}{n-m}.\qquad (*) &lt;/math&gt;

To say that the golden ratio {{math|''φ''}} is rational means that {{math|''φ''}} is a fraction ''n''/''m'' where ''n'' and ''m'' are integers.  We may take ''n''/''m'' to be in [[lowest terms]] and ''n'' and ''m'' to be positive. But if ''n''/''m'' is in lowest terms, then the identity labeled (*) above says ''m''/(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'') is in still lower terms. That is a contradiction that follows from the assumption that {{math|''φ''}} is rational.

====By irrationality of {{radic|5}}====
Another short proof—perhaps more commonly known—of the irrationality of the golden ratio makes use of the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of rational numbers under addition and multiplication. If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is rational, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle2\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right) - 1= \sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt; is also rational, which is a contradiction if it is already known that the square root of a non-[[square number|square]] [[natural number]] is irrational.

===Minimal polynomial===
The golden ratio is also an [[algebraic number]] and even an [[algebraic integer]]. It has [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]]

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 - x - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Having degree 2, this polynomial actually has two roots, the other being the golden ratio conjugate.

===Golden ratio conjugate===
The conjugate root to the minimal polynomial x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − x − 1 is

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{\varphi}=1-\varphi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = -0.61803\,39887\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value of this quantity (≈ 0.618) corresponds to the length ratio taken in reverse order (shorter segment length over longer segment length, ''b/a''), and is sometimes referred to as the ''golden ratio conjugate''.&lt;ref name="MathWorld GR Conjugate"&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Golden Ratio Conjugate|urlname=GoldenRatioConjugate}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is denoted here by the capital Phi ('''&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;'''):

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = {1 \over \varphi} = \varphi^{-1} = 0.61803\,39887\ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, '''&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;''' can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = \varphi -1 = 1.61803\,39887\ldots -1 = 0.61803\,39887\ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

This illustrates the unique property of the golden ratio among positive numbers, that

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \varphi} = \varphi - 1,&lt;/math&gt;

or its inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \Phi} = \Phi + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This means 0.61803...:1 = 1:1.61803....

The formula {{math|''φ''}} = 1 + 1/{{math|''φ''}} can be expanded recursively to obtain a [[continued fraction]] for the golden ratio:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Concrete Abstractions: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Scheme

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = [1; 1, 1, 1, \dots] = 1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \ddots}}}&lt;/math&gt;

and its reciprocal:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1} = [0; 1, 1, 1, \dots] = 0 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \ddots}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Convergent (continued fraction)|convergent]]s of these continued fractions (1/1, 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, 8/5, 13/8, ..., or 1/1, 1/2, 2/3, 3/5, 5/8, 8/13, ...) are ratios of successive [[Fibonacci numbers]].

The equation {{math|''φ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 + {{math|''φ''}} likewise produces the [[Nested radical|continued square root]], or infinite surd, form:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \cdots}}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

An infinite series can be derived to express phi:&lt;ref&gt;Brian Roselle, [http://sites.google.com/site/goldenmeanseries/ "Golden Mean Series"]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi=\frac{13}{8}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{(n+1)}(2n+1)!}{(n+2)!n!4^{(2n+3)}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = 1+2\sin(\pi/10) = 1 + 2\sin 18^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = {1 \over 2}\csc(\pi/10) = {1 \over 2}\csc 18^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = 2\cos(\pi/5)=2\cos 36^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \varphi = 2\sin(3\pi/10)=2\sin 54^\circ. &lt;/math&gt;

These correspond to the fact that the length of the diagonal of a regular pentagon is {{math|''φ''}} times the length of its side, and similar relations in a [[pentagram]].

Overlapping portions appear &lt;span style="color:olive;"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;. The length of the side of one square divided by that of the next smaller square is the golden ratio.]]
The number {{math|''φ''}} turns up frequently in [[geometry]], particularly in figures with pentagonal [[symmetry]].
The length of a regular [[pentagon]]'s [[diagonal]] is {{math|''φ''}} times its side.
The vertices of a regular [[icosahedron]] are those of [[3|three]] mutually [[orthogonal]] golden rectangles.

There is no known general [[algorithm]] to arrange a given number of nodes evenly on a sphere, for any of several definitions of even distribution (see, for example, ''[[Thomson problem]]''). However, a useful approximation results from dividing the sphere into parallel bands of equal [[surface area]] and placing one node in each band at longitudes spaced by a golden section of the circle, i.e. 360°/{{math|''φ''}} ≅ 222.5°. This method was used to arrange the 1500 mirrors of the student-participatory [[artificial satellite|satellite]] [[STARSHINE|Starshine-3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast09oct_1/ |title=A Disco Ball in Space |publisher=NASA |date=2001-10-09 |accessdate=2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Golden triangle, pentagon and pentagram====
[[File:Golden triangle (math).svg|right|thumb|[[Golden triangle (mathematics)|Golden triangle]]. The double-red-arched angle is 36 degrees, or &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{5}&lt;/math&gt; radians.]]

=====Golden triangle=====
The [[Golden triangle (mathematics)|golden triangle]] can be characterized as an [[isosceles triangle]] ABC with the property that [[bisection|bisecting]] the angle C produces a new [[triangle]] CXB which is a [[similar triangle]] to the original.

If angle BCX = α, then XCA = α because of the bisection, and CAB = α because of the similar triangles; ABC = 2α from the original isosceles symmetry, and BXC = 2α by similarity. The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so 5α = 180, giving α = 36°. So the angles of the golden triangle are thus 36°-72°-72°. The angles of the remaining obtuse isosceles triangle AXC (sometimes called the golden gnomon) are 36°-36°-108°.

Suppose XB has length 1, and we call BC length {{math|''φ''}}. Because of the isosceles triangles XC=XA and BC=XC, so these are also length&amp;nbsp;φ. Length AC&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;AB, therefore equals {{math|''φ''}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. But triangle ABC is similar to triangle CXB, so AC/BC&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;BC/BX, AC/{{math|''φ''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;φ/1, and so AC also equals {{math|''φ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus {{math|''φ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, confirming that {{math|''φ''}} is indeed the golden ratio.

Similarly, the ratio of the area of the larger triangle AXC to the smaller CXB is equal to {{math|''φ''}}, while the [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse]] ratio is&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

=====Pentagon=====
In a [[pentagon#Regular pentagons|regular pentagon]] the ratio of a diagonal to a side is the golden ratio, while intersecting diagonals section each other in the golden ratio.&lt;ref name = "Pacioli"/&gt;

=====Odom's construction=====
[[File:Odom.svg|thumb|218 px|Let A and B be midpoints of the sides EF and ED of an equilateral triangle DEF. Extend AB to meet the circumcircle of DEF at C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{|AB|}{|BC|}=\tfrac{|AC|}{|AB|}=\phi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[George Phillips Odom, Jr|George Odom]] has given a remarkably simple construction for {{φ}} involving an equilateral triangle: if an equilateral triangle is inscribed in a circle and the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides is produced to intersect the circle in either of two points, then these three points are in golden proportion. This result is a straightforward consequence of the [[intersecting chords theorem]] and can be used to construct a regular pentagon, a construction that attracted the attention of the noted Canadian geometer [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M. Coxeter]] who published it in Odom's name as a diagram in the ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' accompanied by the single word "Behold!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quandaries and Queries|url=http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/qq/database/QQ.09.02/mary1.html|publisher=Math Central|accessdate=23 October 2011|author=Chris and Penny}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pentagram=====
The golden ratio plays an important role in the geometry of [[pentagram]]s. Each intersection of edges sections other edges in the golden ratio. Also, the ratio of the length of the shorter segment to the segment bounded by the two intersecting edges (a side of the pentagon in the pentagram's center) is {{φ}}, as the four-color illustration shows.

The pentagram includes ten [[isosceles triangle]]s: five [[acute triangle|acute]] and five [[obtuse triangle|obtuse]] isosceles triangles. In all of them, the ratio of the longer side to the shorter side is {{φ}}. The acute triangles are golden triangles. The obtuse isosceles triangles are golden gnomons.

=====Ptolemy's theorem=====
[[File:Ptolemy Pentagon.svg|thumb|The golden ratio in a regular pentagon can be computed using [[Ptolemy's theorem]].]]

The golden ratio properties of a regular pentagon can be confirmed by applying [[Ptolemy's theorem]] to the quadrilateral formed by removing one of its vertices. If the quadrilateral's long edge and diagonals are ''b'', and short edges are ''a'', then Ptolemy's theorem gives ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ab'' which yields

:&lt;math&gt;{b \over a}={{1+\sqrt{5}}\over 2}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Scalenity of triangles====
Consider a [[triangle]] with sides of lengths ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' in decreasing order. Define the "scalenity" of the triangle to be the smaller of the two ratios ''a''/''b'' and ''b''/''c''. The scalenity is always less than {{φ}} and can be made as close as desired to {{φ}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;49–50, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Triangle whose sides form a geometric progression====
If the side lengths of a triangle form a [[geometric progression]] and are in the ratio 1 : ''r'' : ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''r'' is the common ratio, then ''r'' must lie in the range {{φ}}−1 &lt; ''r'' &lt; {{φ}}, which is a consequence of the [[triangle inequality]] (the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be strictly bigger than the length of the third side). If ''r'' = {{φ}} then the shorter two sides are 1 and {{φ}} but their sum is {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, thus ''r'' &lt; {{φ}}. A similar calculation shows that ''r'' &gt; {{φ}}−1. A triangle whose sides are in the ratio 1 : {{radic|{{φ}}}} : {{φ}} is a right triangle (because 1 + {{φ}} = {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) known as a [[Kepler triangle]].&lt;ref name=herz/&gt;

====Golden triangle, rhombus, and rhombic triacontahedron====
[[File:GoldenRhombus.svg|thumb|One of the rhombic triacontahedron's rhombi]]

[[File:Rhombictriacontahedron.svg|thumb|All of the faces of the rhombic triacontahedron are golden rhombi]]

A [[golden rhombus]] is a [[rhombus]] whose diagonals are in the golden ratio. The [[rhombic triacontahedron]] is a [[convex polytope]] that has a very special property: all of its faces are golden rhombi.  In the [[rhombic triacontahedron]] the [[dihedral angle]] between any two adjacent rhombi is 144°, which is twice the isosceles angle of a golden triangle and four times its most acute angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Catalan solids derived from three-dimensional-root systems and quaternions|first1=Mehmet|last1=Koca|first2=Nazife Ozdes|last2=Koca|first3=Ramazan|last3=Koç|journal=	Journal of Mathematical Physics|volume=51|year=2010|page=043501|doi=10.1063/1.3356985|arxiv=0908.3272|bibcode=2010JMP....51d3501K}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to Fibonacci sequence===
The mathematics of the golden ratio and of the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]] are intimately interconnected. The Fibonacci sequence is:

:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, ...

A [[closed-form expression]] for the Fibonacci sequence involves the golden ratio:

:&lt;math&gt;F\left(n\right)
 = {{\varphi^n-(1-\varphi)^n} \over {\sqrt 5}}
 = {{\varphi^n-(-\varphi)^{-n}} \over {\sqrt 5}}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Golden Square fractal with T-branching 8.svg|thumb|Golden squares with [[T-square (fractal)|T-branching]]]]
[[File:Golden Square fractal 6.svg|thumb|Golden square fractal]]

The golden ratio is the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the ratios of successive terms of the Fibonacci sequence (or any Fibonacci-like sequence), as originally shown by [[Kepler]]:&lt;ref name="tatt"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}=\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if a Fibonacci number is divided by its immediate predecessor in the sequence, the quotient approximates {{φ}}; e.g., 987/610&amp;nbsp;{{math|≈}}&amp;nbsp;1.6180327868852. These approximations are alternately lower and higher than {{φ}}, and converge to {{φ}} as the Fibonacci numbers increase, and:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|F_n\varphi-F_{n+1}|

= \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F_{n+a}}{F_n} = \varphi^a,&lt;/math&gt;

where above, the ratios of consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence, is a case when &lt;math&gt;a = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the successive powers of {{φ}} obey the Fibonacci [[recurrence relation|recurrence]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^{n+1} = \varphi^n + \varphi^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This identity allows any polynomial in {{φ}} to be reduced to a linear expression. For example:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
3\varphi^3 - 5\varphi^2 + 4 &amp; = 3(\varphi^2 + \varphi) - 5\varphi^2 + 4 \\
&amp; = 3[(\varphi + 1) + \varphi] - 5(\varphi + 1) + 4 \\
&amp; = \varphi + 2 \approx 3.618.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The reduction to a linear expression can be accomplished in one step by using the relationship
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^k=F_k \varphi +F_{k-1},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F_k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k''th Fibonacci number.

However, this is no special property of {{φ}}, because polynomials in any solution ''x'' to a [[quadratic equation]] can be reduced in an analogous manner, by applying:
:&lt;math&gt;x^2=ax+b&lt;/math&gt;
for given coefficients ''a'', ''b'' such that ''x'' satisfies the equation. Even more generally, any [[rational function]] (with rational coefficients) of the root of an irreducible ''n''th-degree polynomial over the rationals can be reduced to a polynomial of degree {{nowrap|''n'' ‒ 1.}}  Phrased in terms of [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], if α is a root of an irreducible ''n''th-degree polynomial, then &lt;math&gt;\Q(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; has degree ''n'' over &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt;, with basis &lt;math&gt;\{1, \alpha, \dots, \alpha^{n-1}\}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Symmetries===
The golden ratio and inverse golden ratio &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\pm = (1\pm \sqrt{5})/2&lt;/math&gt; have a set of symmetries that preserve and interrelate them. They are both preserved by the [[fractional linear transformation]]s &lt;math&gt;x, 1/(1-x), (x-1)/x,&lt;/math&gt; – this fact corresponds to the identity and the definition quadratic equation.
Further, they are interchanged by the three maps &lt;math&gt;1/x, 1-x, x/(x-1)&lt;/math&gt; – they are reciprocals, symmetric about &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;, and (projectively) symmetric about 2.

More deeply, these maps form a subgroup of the [[modular group]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}(2,\mathbf{Z})&lt;/math&gt; isomorphic to the [[symmetric group]] on 3 letters, &lt;math&gt;S_3,&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the [[stabilizer subgroup|stabilizer]] of the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1,\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; of 3 standard points on the [[projective line]], and the symmetries correspond to the quotient map &lt;math&gt;S_3 \to S_2&lt;/math&gt; – the subgroup &lt;math&gt;C_3 &lt; S_3&lt;/math&gt; consisting of the 3-cycles and the identity &lt;math&gt;() (0 1 \infty) (0 \infty 1)&lt;/math&gt; fixes the two numbers, while the 2-cycles interchange these, thus realizing the map.

===Other properties===
The golden ratio has the simplest expression (and slowest convergence) as a continued fraction expansion of any irrational number (see ''Alternate forms'' above). It is, for that reason, one of the [[continued fraction#A property of the golden ratio φ|worst cases]] of [[Lagrange's approximation theorem]] and it is an extremal case of the [[Hurwitz's theorem (number theory)|Hurwitz inequality]] for [[Diophantine approximation]]s. This may be why angles close to the golden ratio often show up in [[phyllotaxis]] (the growth of plants).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat2.html Fibonacci Numbers and Nature – Part 2 : Why is the Golden section the "best" arrangement?], from [http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/ Dr. Ron Knott's] [http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/ Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Section], retrieved 2012-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining quadratic polynomial and the conjugate relationship lead to decimal values that have their fractional part in common with {{φ}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^2 = \varphi + 1 = 2.618\dots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \varphi} = \varphi - 1 = 0.618\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

The sequence of powers of {{φ}} contains these values 0.618..., 1.0, 1.618..., 2.618...; more generally,
any power of {{φ}} is equal to the sum of the two immediately preceding powers:

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi^n = \varphi^{n-1} + \varphi^{n-2} = \varphi \cdot \operatorname{F}_n + \operatorname{F}_{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

As a result, one can easily decompose any power of {{φ}} into a multiple of {{φ}} and a constant. The multiple and the constant are always adjacent Fibonacci numbers. This leads to another property of the positive powers of {{φ}}:

If &lt;math&gt; \lfloor n/2 - 1 \rfloor = m &lt;/math&gt;, then:

:&lt;math&gt; \!\ \varphi^n = \varphi^{n-1} + \varphi^{n-3} + \cdots + \varphi^{n-1-2m} + \varphi^{n-2-2m} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \!\ \varphi^n - \varphi^{n-1} = \varphi^{n-2} . &lt;/math&gt;

When the golden ratio is used as the base of a [[numeral system]] (see [[Golden ratio base]], sometimes dubbed ''phinary'' or {{φ}}''-nary''), every integer has a terminating representation, despite {{φ}} being irrational, but every fraction has a non-terminating representation.

The golden ratio is a [[Fundamental unit (number theory)|fundamental unit]] of the [[algebraic number field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})&lt;/math&gt; and is a [[Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=PisotNumber |title=Pisot Number}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\varphi^n = {{L_n + F_n \sqrt{5}} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L_n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th [[Lucas number]].

The golden ratio also appears in [[hyperbolic geometry]], as the maximum distance from a point on one side of an [[ideal triangle]] to the closer of the other two sides: this distance, the side length of the [[equilateral triangle]] formed by the points of tangency of a circle inscribed within the ideal triangle, is &lt;math&gt;4\log(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabri.net/abracadabri/GeoNonE/GeoHyper/KBModele/Biss3KB.html Horocycles exinscrits : une propriété hyperbolique remarquable], cabri.net, retrieved 2009-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decimal expansion===
The golden ratio's decimal expansion can be calculated directly from the expression
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = {1+\sqrt{5} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;

with {{radic|5}} ≈ 2.2360679774997896964 {{OEIS2C|id=A002163}}. The [[square root of 5]] can be calculated with the [[Babylonian method]], starting with an initial estimate such as ''x''{{φ}} = 2 and [[iterative method|iterating]]

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{(x_n + 5/x_n)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ..., until the difference between ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; becomes zero, to the desired number of digits.

The Babylonian algorithm for {{radic|5}} is equivalent to [[Newton's method]] for solving the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;5 = 0. In its more general form, Newton's method can be applied directly to any [[algebraic equation]], including the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 = 0 that defines the golden ratio. This gives an iteration that converges to the golden ratio itself,

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2 + 1}{2x_n - 1},&lt;/math&gt;

for an appropriate initial estimate ''x''{{φ}} such as ''x''{{φ}} = 1. A slightly faster method is to rewrite the equation as ''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1/''x'' = 0, in which case the Newton iteration becomes

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2 + 2x_n}{x_n^2 + 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

These iterations all [[quadratic convergence|converge quadratically]]; that is, each step roughly doubles the number of correct digits. The golden ratio is therefore relatively easy to compute with [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic|arbitrary precision]]. The time needed to compute ''n'' digits of the golden ratio is proportional to the time needed to divide two ''n''-digit numbers. This is considerably faster than known algorithms for the [[transcendental number]]s '''[[pi|{{pi}}]]''' and [[e (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|'''e'''}}]].

An easily programmed alternative using only integer arithmetic is to calculate two large consecutive Fibonacci numbers and divide them. The ratio of Fibonacci numbers ''F'' &lt;sub&gt;25001&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F'' &lt;sub&gt;25000&lt;/sub&gt;, each over 5000 digits, yields over 10,000 significant digits of the golden ratio.

The decimal expansion of the golden ratio {{φ}}&lt;ref name="a001622"/&gt; has been calculated to an accuracy of two trillion ({{val|2|e=12}} = 2,000,000,000,000) digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.numberworld.org/digits/GoldenRatio/ |title=Golden Ratio |first= Alexander J. |last=Yee |date=17 August 2015 |website=numberword.org}}  Independent computations done by Ron Watkins and Dustin Kirkland.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of art sidebar}}

The '''history of art''' focuses on objects made by humans in visual form for [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] purposes. [[Visual art]] [[art#Forms, genres, media and styles|can be classified in diverse ways]], such as separating [[fine art]]s from [[applied arts]]; inclusively focusing on human creativity; or focusing on different media such as [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[film]], [[photography]], and [[graphic arts]].  In recent years, technological advances have led to [[video]] art, [[Digital art|computer art]], [[Performance art]], [[animation]], [[television]], and [[Video game|videogames]].

The history of art is often told as a chronology of [[masterpiece]]s created during each [[civilization]]. It can thus be framed as a story of [[high culture]], epitomized by the [[Wonders of the World]]. On the other hand, [[vernacular]] art expressions can also be integrated into art historical narratives, referred to as [[folk arts]] or [[craft]]. The more closely that an art historian engages with these latter forms of [[low culture]], the more likely it is that they will identify their work as examining [[visual culture]] or [[material culture]], or as contributing to fields related to art history, such as [[anthropology]] or [[archaeology]]. In the latter cases art objects may be referred to as [[Artifact (archaeology)|archeological artifacts]].

{{Main|Prehistoric art}}

The oldest human art that has been found dates to the [[Stone Age]], when the first creative works were made from shell, stone, and paint. During the Paleolithic (25,000–8,000&amp;nbsp;BCE), humans practiced [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] and lived in [[cave]]s, where [[cave painting]] was developed.{{sfn|Gardner|Kleiner|2009|p=2}} During the Neolithic period (6000–3000&amp;nbsp;BCE), the production of [[handicrafts]] commenced.

The earliest human artifacts showing evidence of workmanship with an artistic purpose are the subject of some debate. It is clear that such workmanship  existed by 40,000 years ago in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era, although it is quite possible that it began earlier. Engraved shells created by [[homo erectus]] dating as far back as 500,000 years ago have been found, although experts disagree on whether these engravings can be properly classified as ‘art’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429983.200-shell-art-made-300000-years-before-humans-evolved.html |title=Shell 'art' made 300,000 years before humans evolved |journal=[[New Scientist]] |first=Catherine |last=Brahic |date=3 December 2014 |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:F07 0054.Ma.JPG|thumb|''[[Bison Licking Insect Bite]]'', in carved [[antler]], Museum of Prehistory, [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]]]]
The [[Paleolithic]] had its first artistic manifestation in 25,000&amp;nbsp;BCE, reaching its peak in the [[Magdalenian]] period (±15,000–8,000&amp;nbsp;BCE). Surviving art from this period includes small carvings in stone or bone and [[cave painting]]. The first traces of human-made objects appeared in southern [[Africa]], the [[Western Mediterranean]], [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] ([[Adriatic Sea]]), [[Siberia]] ([[Baikal Lake]]), India and Australia. These first traces are generally worked stone ([[flint]], [[obsidian]]), wood or [[bone]] tools. To [[painting|paint]] in [[red]], [[iron oxide]] was used.  Cave paintings have been found in the [[Franco-Cantabrian region]]. There are pictures that are [[Abstract art|abstract]] as well as pictures that are [[naturalism (visual art)|naturalistic]].  Animals were painted in the caves of [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]], [[Trois Frères]], [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] and [[Lascaux]]. [[Sculpture]] is represented by the so-called ''[[Venus figurines]]'', feminine figures which may have been used in [[fertility cult]]s, such as the ''[[Venus of Willendorf]]''.{{sfn|Gardner|Kleiner|2009|p=3-4}} There is a theory that these figures may have been made by women as expressions of their own body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCoid|first1=Catherine Hodge|last2=McDermott|first2=Leroy D.|date=1996|title=Toward Decolonizing Gender: Female Vision in the Upper Paleolithic|jstor=682890|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=98|issue=2|pages=319–326|doi=10.1525/aa.1996.98.2.02a00080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other representative works of this period are the ''Man from [[Brno]]''&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=A World History of Art|author1=Honour, H.|author2=Fleming, J.|date=2005|publisher=Laurence King|isbn=9781856694513|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qGb4pyoseH4C&amp;pg=PT38|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Venus of Brassempouy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Honour-Fleming (2002), p. 36-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesolithic===
{{Hatnote|Main article: [[Mesolithic]]}}

In Old World archaeology, Mesolithic ([[Ancient Greek language|Greek]]: μέσος, ''mesos'' "middle"; λίθος, ''lithos'' "stone") is the period between
the [[Upper Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]]. The term [[Epipaleolithic]] is often used synonymously, especially for outside [[northern Europe]], and for the corresponding period in [[Epipaleolithic Near East|the Levant]] and [[Epipaleolithic Caucasus|Caucasus]].
The Mesolithic has different time spans in different parts of Eurasia.
It refers to the final period of [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures in Europe and West Asia, between the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] and the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. In Europe it spans roughly 15,000 to 5,000&amp;nbsp;BP, in Southwest Asia (the [[Epipalaeolithic Near East]]) roughly 20,000 to 8,000&amp;nbsp;BP.
The term is less used of areas further east, and not all beyond Eurasia and North Africa.

The Neolithic period began in about 8,000 BCE. The [[rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]]—dated between the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras—contained small, schematic paintings of human figures, with notable examples in [[Roca dels Moros|El Cogul]], Valltorta, [[Alpera]] and Minateda.

Neolithic painting is similar to paintings found in northern Africa ([[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]], Sahara) and in the area of modern Zimbabwe. Neolithic painting is often schematic, made with basic strokes (men in the form of a [[cross]] and women in a [[triangle|triangular]] shape). There are also cave paintings in [[Pinturas River]] in [[Argentina]], especially the [[Cueva de las Manos]]. In [[portable art]], a style called [[Cardium Pottery]] was produced, decorated with imprints of [[seashell]]s. New materials were used in art, such as [[amber]], [[crystal]], and [[jasper]]. In this period, the first traces of urban planning appeared, such as the remains in [[Jericho#Tell es-Sultan|Tell as-Sultan]] ([[Jericho]]), [[Jarmo]] (Iraq) and [[Çatalhöyük]] ([[Anatolia]]).{{sfn|Onians|2004|p=20-25}} In South-Eastern Europe appeared many cultures, such as the [[Cucuteni-Trypillia culture]] and the [[Hamangia culture]], from [[Romania]], [[Republic of Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]]. Another region with many cultures is China most notable being the [[Yangshao culture]] and the [[Longshan culture]].

===Metal Age===

The last prehistoric phase is the Metal Age (or [[Three-age system]]), during which the use of [[copper]], [[bronze]] and [[iron]] transformed ancient societies. When humans could smelt metal and forge metal implements could make new tools, weapons, and art.

In the [[Chalcolithic]] (Copper Age) [[megalith]]s emerged. Examples include the [[dolmen]] and [[menhir]] and the [[England|English]] [[wikt:cromlech|cromlech]], as can be seen in the complexes at [[Newgrange]] and [[Stonehenge]].{{sfn|Gardner|Kleiner|2009|p=12}} In Spain the [[Los Millares]] culture was formed which was characterized by the [[Beaker culture]]. In [[Malta]], the [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|temple complexes]] of [[Ħaġar Qim]], [[Mnajdra]], [[Tarxien Temples|Tarxien]] and [[Ġgantija]] were built. In the [[Balearic Islands]] notable megalithic cultures developed, with different types of monuments: the ''[[naveta]]'', a tomb shaped like a truncated [[pyramid]], with an elongated burial chamber; the ''[[taula]]'', two large stones, one put vertically and the other horizontally above each other; and the ''[[talaiot]]'', a tower with a covered chamber and a false [[dome]].&lt;ref&gt;Azcárate (1983), pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Iron Age]] the cultures of [[Hallstatt]] (Austria) and [[La Tene]] ([[Switzerland]]) emerged in Europe. The first was developed between the 7th and 5th century BCE by the [[List of necropoleis|necropoleis]] with tumular tombs and a wooden burial chamber in the form of a house, often accompanied by a four-wheeled cart. The pottery was [[Polychrome|polychromic]], with [[geometry|geometric]] decorations and applications of metallic ornaments. La Tene was developed between the 5th and 4th century BCE, and is more popularly known as early [[Celtic art]]. It produced many iron objects such as [[sword]]s and [[spear]]s, which have not survived well to the 2000s due to rust.

The [[Bronze Age]] refers to the period when bronze was the best material available.  Bronze was used for highly decorated [[shield]]s, [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulas]], and other objects, with different stages of evolution of the style. Decoration was influenced by [[Art in Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] and [[Scythian art]].{{sfn|Onians|2004|p=30-31}}

In the first period of recorded history, art coincided with [[writing]]. The great civilizations of the [[Near East]]: [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]] arose. Globally, during this period the first great cities appeared near major rivers: the [[Nile]], [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]], [[Indus]] and [[Yellow River|Yellow]] Rivers.

One of the great advances of this period was writing, which was developed from the tradition of communication using pictures. The first form of writing were the [[Jiahu symbols]] from neolithic China, but the first true writing was [[cuneiform script]], which emerged in Mesopotamia c. 3500&amp;nbsp;BCE, written on [[clay]] tablets. It was based on [[Pictogram|pictographic]] and [[Ideogram|ideographic]] elements, while later Sumerians developed [[syllable]]s for writing, reflecting the [[phonology]] and [[syntax]] of the [[Sumerian language]]. In Egypt [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] was developed using pictures as well, appearing on art such as the [[Narmer Palette]] (3,100&amp;nbsp;BCE). The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] sculpted seals with short texts and decorated with representations of animals and people. Meanwhile, the [[Olmecs]] sculpted [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]] and decorated other sculptures with [[Olmecs#Writing|their own hierglyphs]].

[[Mesopotamian art]] was developed in the area between [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] Rivers in modern day Syria and Iraq, where since the 4th millennium BCE many different cultures existed such as [[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Amorite]] and [[Chaldea]]. [[Architecture of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian architecture]] was characterized by the use of [[brick]]s, [[lintel (architecture)|lintels]], and [[cone mosaic]]. Notable are the [[ziggurat]]s, large [[temple]]s in the form of [[step pyramid]]s. The tomb was a chamber covered with a false [[dome]], as in some examples found at [[Ur]]. There were also [[palace]]s walled with a terrace in the form of a ziggurat, where gardens were an important feature. The [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].

[[Relief]] sculpture was developed in [[wood carving|wood]] and [[stone]]. Sculpture depicted religious, military, and hunting scenes, including both human and animal figures. In the [[Sumer]]ian period, small statues of people were produced. These statues had an angular form and were produced from colored stone. The figures typically had bald head with hands folded on the chest. In the Akkadian period, statues depicted figures with long hair and beards, such as the [[stele]] of [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]]. In the Amorite period (or Neosumerian), statues represented kings from [[Gudea]] of [[Lagash]], with their mantle and a turban on their heads and their hands on their chests. During Babylonian rule, the stele of [[Hammurabi]] was important, as it depicted the great king Hammurabi above a written copy of the laws that he introduced. Assyrian sculpture is notable for its [[anthropomorphism]] of cattle and the [[winged genie]], which is depicted flying in many reliefs depicting war and hunting scenes, such as in the [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III|Black Obelisk]] of [[Shalmaneser III]].&lt;ref&gt;Azcárate (1983), pp. 36–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===

The mummy mask of [[Tutankhamun]] is perhaps the most iconic object to suvive from ancient Egypt]]
One of the first great civilizations arose in [[Egypt]], which had elaborate and complex works of art produced by professional artists and craftspeople. Egypt's art was religious and symbolic. Given that the culture had a highly centralized power structure and hierarchy, a great deal of art was created to honour the [[pharaoh]], including great monuments. Egyptian art and culture emphasized the religious concept of immortality. Later Egyptian art includes [[Coptic art|Coptic]] and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] art.

The [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|architecture]] is characterized by monumental structures, built with large stone blocks, lintels, and solid [[column]]s. Funerary monuments included [[mastaba]], tombs of rectangular form; [[pyramid]]s, which included step pyramids ([[Saqqarah]]) or smooth-sided pyramids ([[Giza]]); and the [[hypogeum]], underground tombs ([[Valley of the Kings]]). Other great buildings were the [[temple]], which tended to be monumental complexes preceded by an avenue of [[sphinx]]es and [[obelisk]]s. Temples used [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] and [[trapezoid]] walls with [[hypaethros]] and [[hypostyle]] halls and [[shrine]]s. The temples of [[Karnak]], [[Luxor]], [[Philae]] and [[Edfu]] are good examples. Another type of temple is the [[rock temple]], in the form of a [[hypogeum]], found in [[Abu Simbel]] and [[Deir el-Bahari]].

Painting of the Egyptian era used a juxtaposition of overlapping planes. The images were represented hierarchically, i.e., the Pharaoh is larger than the common subjects or enemies depicted at his side. Egyptians painted the outline of the head and limbs in profile, while the torso, hands, and eyes were painted from the front. [[Applied arts]] were developed in Egypt, in particular [[Cabinet making|woodwork]] and [[Goldsmith|metalwork]]. There are superb examples such as [[cedrus|cedar]] furniture [[Inlay|inlaid]] with [[ebony]] and [[ivory]] which can be seen in the tombs at the [[Egyptian Museum]].

Discovered long after the contemporary civilizations of [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Egypt]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] or Harappan civilization (circa 2400–1900 BC) is now recognized as extraordinaly advansed, comparable in many ways with those cultures.

Various sculptures, seals, bronze vessels [[Indian Pottery|pottery]], gold jewellery, and anatomically detailed figurines in [[terracotta]], bronze, and steatite have been found at excavation sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC|first=Jane|last=McIntosh|page=248|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of gold, terracotta and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some dance form. These terracotta figurines included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs. The animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified. Part bull, part zebra, with a majestic horn, it has been a source of speculation. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultic significance, but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the IVC are religious symbols.&lt;ref name="Keay, John 2000"&gt;Keay, John, India, a History.  New York: Grove Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Marshall (archaeologist)|Sir John Marshall]] reacted with surprise when he saw the famous Indus bronze statuette of a slender-limbed [[Dancing Girl (sculpture)|dancing girl]] in Mohenjo-daro:

{{quote|When I first saw them I found it difficult to believe that they were prehistoric; they seemed to completely upset all established ideas about early art, and culture. Modeling such as this was unknown in the ancient world up to the Hellenistic age of Greece, and I thought, therefore, that some mistake must surely have been made; that these figures had found their way into levels some 3000 years older than those to which they properly belonged&amp;nbsp;.... Now, in these statuettes, it is just this anatomical truth which is so startling; that makes us wonder whether, in this all-important matter, Greek artistry could possibly have been anticipated by the sculptors of a far-off age on the banks of the Indus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India discovered|page=172|publisher=Collins|author=John Keay|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Seals have been found at [[Mohenjo-daro]] depicting a figure standing on its head, and another sitting cross-legged in what some call a [[yoga]]-like pose (see image, the so-called ''Pashupati'', below).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} This figure, sometimes known as a [[Pashupati seal|Pashupati]], has been variously identified.

[[Greek art|Greek]] and [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] artists built on the artistic foundations of Egypt, further developing the arts of sculpture, painting, architecture, and ceramics. Greek art started as smaller and simpler than Egyptian art, and the influence of Egyptian art on the Greeks started in the Cycladic islands between 3300–3200 BCE. [[Cycladic art|Cycladic]] statues were simple, lacking facial features except for the nose.

Greek art eventually included life-sized statues, such as [[Kouros]] figures. The standing Kouros of Attica is typical of early Greek sculpture and dates from 600 BCE. From this early stage, the art of Greece moved into the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Period]]. Sculpture from this time period includes the characteristic [[Archaic smile]]. This distinctive smile may have conveyed that the subject of the sculpture had been alive or that the subject had been blessed by the gods and was well.

Phoenician art lacks unique characteristics that might distinguish it from its contemporaries. This is due to its being highly influenced by foreign artistic cultures: primarily [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], Greece and [[Assyria]]. Phoenicians who were taught on the banks of the [[Nile]] and the [[Euphrates]] gained a wide artistic experience and finally came to create their own art, which was an amalgam of foreign models and perspectives. Even so, Phoenician influenced other styles, inclusive [[Iberian sculpture]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1879/01/05/81740354.pdf|title=Phoenician Art|format=PDF|work = The New York Times |accessdate=2008-06-20 | date=1879-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article from ''[[The New York Times]]'' published on January 5, 1879, Phoenician art was described by the following:

{{bquote|He entered into other men's labors and made most of his heritage. The [[Sphinx]] of Egypt became [[Asian people|Asiatic]], and its new form was transplanted to [[Nineveh]] on the one side and to Greece on the other. The rosettes and other patterns of the [[Babylonia]]n cylinders were introduced into the handiwork of Phoenicia, and so passed on to the West, while the hero of the ancient [[Chaldea]]n epic became first the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] [[Melkart]]h, and then the [[Herakles]] of Hellas.}}

=== Etruscan ===

[[Etruscan art]] was produced by the [[Etruscan civilization]] in [[central Italy]] between the 9th and 2nd centuries BCE. From around 600 BCE it was heavily influenced by [[Greek art]], which was imported by the Etruscans, but always retained distinct characteristics.  Particularly strong in this tradition were figurative sculpture in terracotta (especially life-size on [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] or temples), wall-painting and [[metalworking]] especially in bronze. Jewellery and [[engraved gem]]s of high quality were produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |last=Boardman |first=John |author-link=John Boardman (art historian) |title=The Oxford History of Classical Art |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1993 |pages=350–351 |isbn=0198143869 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=pcDpAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etruscan sculpture in cast bronze was famous and widely exported, but relatively few large examples have survived (the material was too valuable, and recycled later).  In contrast to terracotta and bronze, there was relatively little Etruscan sculpture in stone, despite the Etruscans controlling fine sources of marble, including [[Carrara marble]], which seems not to have been exploited until the Romans.

The great majority of survivals came from tombs, which were typically crammed with [[sarcophagi]] and [[grave goods]], and terracotta fragments of architectural sculpture, mostly around temples.  Tombs have produced all the [[fresco]] wall-paintings, which show scenes of feasting and some narrative mythological subjects.

[[Dacian art]] is the art associated with the peoples known as [[Dacians]] or ''North [[Thracians]]''; The Dacians created an art style in which the influences of [[Scythians]] and the Greeks can be seen. They were highly skilled in gold and silver working and in pottery making. Pottery was white with red decorations in flolral, geometric, and stylized animal motifs. Similar decorations were worked in metal, especially the figure of a horse, which was common on Dacian coins.{{sfn| Waldman| Mason |2006|p=208}} Today, a big collection of Dacic masterpieces is in the [[National Museum of Romanian History]] ([[Bucharest]]), one of the most famous being the [[Helmet of Coțofenești]].

The Geto-Dacians lived in a very large territory, stretching from the [[Balkans]] to the northern [[Carpathians]] and from the [[Black Sea]] and the river [[Tyras]] to the [[Tisza|Tisa]] plain, sometimes even to the [[Middle Danube]].{{sfn|MacKenzie|1986|p=25}} Between 15th-12th century, the Dacian-Getae culture was influenced by the Bronze Age Tumulus-Urnfield warriors.{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59}}

Pre-Roman Iberian art refers to the styles developed by the [[Iberians]] from the [[Bronze age]] up to the [[Roman conquest of Hispania|Roman conquest]].  For this reason it is sometimes described as "Iberian art".

Almost all extant works of Iberian sculpture visibly reflect [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Phoenicia]]n influences, and [[Assyria]]n, [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Egypt]]ian influences from which those derived; yet they have their own unique character. Within this complex stylistic heritage, individual works can be placed within a spectrum of influences- some of more obvious Phoenician derivation, and some so similar to Greek works that they could have been directly imported from that region. Overall the degree of influence is correlated to the work's region of origin, and hence they are classified into groups on that basis.

=== Hittite ===
{{main|Hittite art}}
[[File:IvrizRelief.JPG|thumb|left|The ''[[İvriz relief]]'', king [[Warpalawas]] (right) before the god [[Tarhunzas]]]]
Hittite art was produced by the [[Hittites|Hittite civilization]] in ancient [[Anatolia]], in modern-day [[Turkey]], and also stretching into [[Syria]] during the second millennium BCE from the nineteenth century up until the twelfth century BCE. This period falls under the Anatolian [[Bronze Age]]. It is characterized by a long tradition of canonized images and motifs rearranged, while still being recognizable, by artists to convey meaning to a largely illiterate population. &lt;blockquote&gt;“Owing to the limited vocabulary of figural types [and motifs], invention for the Hittite artist usually was a matter of combining and manipulating the units to form more complex compositions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sculpture and Sculptors of Yazılıkaya|last=Alexander|first=Robert L.|publisher=University of Delaware Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Newark|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Many of these recurring images revolve around the depiction of [[Hittite mythology and religion|Hittite deities and ritual practices]]. There is also a prevalence of hunting scenes in Hittite relief and representational animal forms. Much of the art comes from settlements like [[Alaca Höyük]], or the Hittite capital of [[Hattusa]] near modern-day [[Boğazkale]]. Scholars do have difficulty dating a large portion of Hittite art, citing the fact that there is a lack of inscription and much of the found material, especially from burial sites, was moved from their original locations and distributed among museums during the nineteenth century.

The Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex is the modern archaeological designation for a [[Bronze Age]] [[civilization]] of [[Central Asia]], dated to c. 2300–1700 BCE, located in present-day northern [[Afghanistan]], eastern [[Turkmenistan]], southern [[Uzbekistan]] and western [[Tajikistan]], centred on the upper [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus River). Its sites were discovered and named by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] archaeologist [[Viktor Sarianidi]] (1976).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

BMAC materials have been found in the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], on the [[Iranian Plateau]], and in the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name="LambergKarlovskyArchaeology"&gt;C.C. Lamberg-Karlovsky, "Archaeology and Language: The Indo-Iranians", ''Current Anthropology'', vol. 43, no. 1 (Feb.  2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Finds within BMAC sites provide further evidence of trade and cultural contacts. They include an Elamite-type cylinder seal and a [[Harappa]]n seal stamped with an elephant and Indus script found at Gonur-depe.{{sfn|Kohl|2007|pp=196–199}} The relationship between Altyn-Depe and the Indus Valley seems to have been particularly strong. Among the finds there were two [[Harappa]]n seals and ivory objects. The Harappan settlement of [[Shortugai]] in Northern Afghanistan on the banks of the [[Amu Darya]] probably served as a trading station.&lt;ref name="MassonThe"&gt;V. M. Masson, "The Bronze Age in Khorasan and Transoxiana," chapter 10 in A.H. Dani and Vadim Mikhaĭlovich Masson (eds.), ''History of civilizations of Central Asia'', volume 1: ''The dawn of civilization: earliest times to 700 BCE'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous type of Bactrian artworks are the "Bactrian pricesses". Wearing large stylized dresses with puffed sleeves, as well as headdresses that merge with the hair, they embody the ranking goddess, character of the central Asian mythology that plays a regulatory role, pacifying the untamed forces.

=== Celtic ===
{{main|Celtic art}}

Celtic art is associated with the peoples known as [[Celts]]; those who spoke the [[Celtic languages]] in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period. It also refers to the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.

Celtic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the [[Bronze Age]], and indeed the preceding [[Neolithic age]]; however archaeologists generally use "Celtic" to refer to the culture of the [[European Iron Age]] from around 1000 BCE onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about "Celtic art" only from the [[La Tène]] period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BCE) onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, for example; see their introductory section, where they explain the situation &amp; that their article will only cover the La Tène period.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Celtic art is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/project_archive/technologies_of_enchantment.aspx |title=Technologies of Enchantment: Early Celtic Art in Britain |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804214909/http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/project_archive/technologies_of_enchantment.aspx |archive-date=2012-08-04 |publisher=[[British Museum]]}} It is also used by Jacobsthal; however the equivalent "Late Celtic art" for Early Medieval work is much rarer, and "Late Celtic art" can also mean the later part of the prehistoric period.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Early Medieval]] art of Britain and Ireland, which produced the [[Book of Kells]] and other masterpieces, and is what "Celtic art" evokes for much of the general public in the English-speaking world, is called [[Insular art]] in art history.  This is the best-known part, but not the whole of, the Celtic art of the Early Middle Ages, which also includes the Pictish art of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Laings, 6–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Achaemenid art includes [[frieze]] reliefs, metalwork, decoration of palaces, glazed brick masonry, fine craftsmanship (masonry, carpentry, etc.), and gardening. Most survivals of court art are monumental sculpture, above all the [[relief]]s, double animal-headed [[Persian column]] capitals and other sculptures of [[Persepolis]] (see below for the few but impressive Achaemenid rock reliefs).&lt;ref name="Cotterell, 161–162"&gt;Cotterell, 161–162&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Persians took artists, with their styles and techniques, from all corners of their empire, they produced not simply a combination of styles, but a synthesis of a new unique Persian style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Edward Lipiński, Karel van Lerberghe, Antoon Schoors|author2=Karel Van Lerberghe|author3=Antoon Schoors| title = Immigration and emigration within the ancient Near East| url = https://books.google.com/?id=thIxCmwfNoMC| year = 1995| publisher = Peeters Publishers| isbn = 978-90-6831-727-5| page = 119 }}; Cotterell, 162&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus the Great in fact had an extensive ancient Iranian heritage behind him; the rich Achaemenid gold work, which inscriptions suggest may have been a specialty of the Medes, was for instance in the tradition of earlier sites.

There are a number of very fine pieces of jewellery or inlay in precious metal, also mostly featuring animals, and the  [[Oxus Treasure]] has a wide selection of types.  Small pieces, typically in gold, were sewn to clothing by the elite, and a number of gold [[torc]]s have survived.&lt;ref name="Cotterell, 161–162"/&gt;

[[Roman art]] is sometimes viewed as derived from Greek precedents, but also has its own distinguishing features. Roman sculpture is often less idealized than the Greek precedents, being very realistic. Roman architecture often used [[concrete]], and features such as the round [[arch]] and [[dome]] were invented.

Roman artwork was influenced by the nation-state's interaction with other people's, such as ancient [[Judea]]. A major monument is the Arch of Titus, which was erected by the Emperor Titus. Scenes of Romans looting the Jewish temple in Jerusalem are depicted in low-relief sculptures around the arch's perimeter.

[[Ancient Roman pottery]] was not a luxury product, but a vast production of "fine wares" in ''[[terra sigillata]]'' were decorated with reliefs that reflected the latest taste, and provided a large group in society with stylish objects at what was evidently an affordable price. [[Roman coins]] were an important means of propaganda, and have survived in enormous numbers.

In Byzantine and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] art of the [[Middle Ages]], the dominance of the church resulted in a large amount of religious art.  There was extensive use of gold in paintings, which presented figures in simplified forms.

Anglo-Saxon art covers art produced within the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] period of English history, beginning with the [[Migration period art|Migration period]] style that the Anglo-Saxons brought with them from the continent in the 5th century, and ending in 1066 with the [[Norman Conquest]] of a large Anglo-Saxon nation-state whose sophisticated art was influential in much of northern Europe.  The two periods of outstanding achievement were the 7th and 8th centuries, with the metalwork and jewellery from [[Sutton Hoo]] and a series of magnificent illuminated manuscripts, and the final period after about 950, when there was a revival of English culture after the end of the [[Viking]] invasions.  By the time of the Conquest the move to the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style is nearly complete.  The important artistic centres, in so far as these can be established, were concentrated in the extremities of England, in [[Northumbria]], especially in the early period, and [[Wessex]] and [[Kent]] near the south coast.

====Ottonian art====
{{main|Ottonian art}}
[[File:Kreuzmitdengroßen Senkschmelzen.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The ''[[Essen cross with large enamels]]''; part of the [[Essen Cathedral Treasury]]]]
Ottonian art is a [[style (visual arts)|style]] in [[Pre-Romanesque art|pre-romanesque]] [[German art]], covering also some works from the [[Low Countries]], northern Italy and eastern France. It was named by the art historian [[Hubert Janitschek]] after the [[Ottonian dynasty]] which ruled Germany and northern Italy between 919 and 1024 under the kings [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]], [[Otto I]], [[Otto II]], [[Otto III]] and [[Emperor Henry II|Henry II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://arthistorians.info/janitschekh |title=Dictionary of Art Historians: Janitschek, Hubert |access-date=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Ottonian architecture]], it is a key component of the [[Ottonian Renaissance]] (circa 951–1024).  However, the style neither began nor ended to neatly coincide with the rule of the dynasty.  It emerged some decades into their rule and persisted past the Ottonian emperors into the reigns of the early [[Salian dynasty]], which lacks an artistic "style label" of its own.&lt;ref name="Suckale-Redlefsen, 524"&gt;Suckale-Redlefsen, 524&lt;/ref&gt;  In the traditional scheme of art history, Ottonian art follows [[Carolingian art]] and precedes [[Romanesque art]], though the transitions at both ends of the period are gradual rather than sudden.  Like the former and unlike the latter, it was very largely a style restricted to a few of the small cities of the period, and important [[monastery|monasteries]], as well as the court circles of the emperor and his leading [[vassal]]s.

====Viking art====
{{main|Viking art}}
Viking art, also known commonly as Norse art, is a term widely accepted for the [[art]] of [[Scandinavia]]n [[Norsemen]] and [[Vikings|Viking]] settlements further afield—particularly in the [[British Isles]] and [[Iceland]]—during the [[Viking Age]] of the 8th-11th centuries CE. Viking art has many design elements in common with [[Celtic Art|Celtic]], [[Migration Period art|Germanic]], the later [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and Eastern European art, sharing many influences with each of these traditions.&lt;ref&gt;*Maurizio Tani, ''Le origini mediterranee ed eurasiatiche dell’arte vichinga.

{{main|Culture of ancient Rus}}
Slavic architecure is a mix of [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and Pagan architecture. Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers. Most iconic buildings are the [[Russian architecture|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian culture#Architecture|Ukrainian]] cathedrals. These cathedrals are well known for their unsusual [[onion domes]], which are decorated with geometric and colorful patterns. It is not completely clear when and why onion domes became a typical feature of [[Russian architecture]]. [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine churches]] and the [[architecture of Kievan Rus]] were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which is lined with sheet iron or tiles. Russian architecture used the dome shape not only for churches but also for other buildings.

[[South Slavs|South Slavic]] art was highly influenced by Byzantine art and architecture, more than the [[East Slavs]]. They were also influenced by Greek culture, but not really much.

The use and making of icons entered [[Kievan Rus']] following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman ([[Byzantine]]) Empire in 988 AD. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians—notably [[Andrei Rublev]] and [[Dionisius]]—widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the seventeenth century, when [[Simon Ushakov]]'s painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.

===Renaissance and Baroque===

The [[Renaissance]] is the return to a valuation of the material world, and this paradigm shift is reflected in art forms, which show the corporeality of the human body, and the three-dimensional reality of [[landscape]]s. Art historians often [[Art periods|periodize]] Renaissance art by century, especially with [[Italian art]]. [[Italian Renaissance]] and [[Baroque art]] is traditionally referred to by centuries: [[trecento]] for the fourteenth century, [[quattrocento]] for the fifteenth, [[cinquecento]] for the sixteenth, and [[seicento]] for the seventeenth.

The art of [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] is related to that of neighbouring cultures. Pre-Islamic [[Yemen]] produced stylized [[alabaster]] heads of great aesthetic and historic charm.  Most of the pre-Islamic sculptures are made of [[alabaster]].

[[Archaeology]] has revealed some early settled civilizations in [[Saudi Arabia]]: the [[Dilmun]] civilization on the east of the Arabian Peninsula, [[Thamud]] north of the [[Hejaz]], and [[Kindah]] kingdom and [[Al-Magar]] civilization in the central of Arabian Peninsula.
The earliest known events in Arabian history are migrations from the peninsula into neighbouring areas.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Khuri Hitti (2002), History of the Arabs, Revised: 10th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; In antiquity, the role of [[South Arabia]]n societies such as Saba ([[Sheba]]) in the production and trade of aromatics not only brought such kigdoms wealth but also tied the [[Arabian peninsula]] into trade networks, resulting in far-ranging artistic influences.

It seems probable that before around 4000 BCE the Arabian climate was somewhat wetter that today, benefitting from a monsoon system that has since moved south.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} During the late fourth millennium BCE permanent settlements began to appear, and inhabitants adjusted to the emerging dryer conditions. In south-west Arabia (modern [[Yemen]]) a moister climate supported several kingdoms during the second and first millennia BCE. The most famos of these is [[Sheba]], the kingdom of the biblical [[Queen of Sheba]]. These societies used a combination of trade in spices and the natural resources of the region, including aromatics such as frankincense and myrrh, to build wealthy kingdoms. [[Ma'rib#Ancient|Mārib]], the [[Sabaeans|Sabaean]] capital, was well positioned to tap into Mediterranean as well as Near Eastern trade, and in kingdoms to the east, in what is today [[Oman]], trading links with [[Mesopotamia]], [[Persia]] and even India were possible. The area was never a part of the [[Assyria]]n or [[Persian empire]]s, and even [[Babylon]]ian control of north-west Arabia seems to have been relatively short-lived. Later Roman attempts to control the region's lucrative trade foundered. This impenetrability to foreign armies doubtless augmented ancient rulers' bargaining power in the spice and incense trade.

Although subject to external  influences, south Arabia retained characteristics particular to itself. The human figure is typically based on strong, square shapes, the fine modeling of detail contrastingwith a stylized simplicity of form.

Some branches of Islam [[Aniconism in Islam|forbid depictions of people]] and other sentient beings, as they may be misused as idols. Religious ideas are thus often represented through geometric designs and [[calligraphy]]. However, there are many Islamic paintings which display religious themes and scenes of stories common among the three Abrahamic [[monotheistic]] faiths of [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], and [[Judaism]].

The influence of [[Chinese ceramics]] has to be viewed in the broader context of the considerable importance of Chinese culture on [[Islamic art]]s in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/press/exhibitions/2012/chinese-ceramics-on-great-hall-balcony |first=Denise Patry |last=Leidy |title=Evolution of Chinese Ceramics and Their Global Influence are Theme of Entirely New Installation on Metropolitan Museum's Great Hall Balcony |work=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |date=14 September 2012 |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[İznik pottery]] (named after [[İznik]], a city from [[Turkey]]) is one of the best well-known types of Islamic pottery.

The art of the Eskimo people from Siberia is in the same style as the [[Inuit art]] from [[Alaska]] and north Canada. This is because the Native Americans traveled through Siberia to Alaska, and later to the rest of the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Including the [[Russian Far East]], the population of [[Siberia]] numbers just above 40 million people. As a result of the 17th-to-19th-century [[Russian conquest of Siberia]] and the subsequent [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|population movements during the Soviet era]], the [[demographics of Siberia]] today is dominated by native speakers of [[Russian language|Russian]]. There remain a considerable number of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] groups, between them accounting for below 10% of total Siberian population, which are also genetically related to [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas]].

At a height of {{cvt|11|in|cm|0|order=flip}}, it is one of the largest jade objects ever found in Mesoamerica, [[American Museum of Natural History]]]]
The history of art in the Americas begins in [[Pre-Columbian art|pre-Columbian]] times with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous cultures]]. Art historians have focused particularly closely on [[Mesoamerica]] during this early era, because a series of stratified cultures arose there that erected grand architecture and produced [[Mesoamerica#Political and religious art|objects of fine workmanship]] that are comparable to the arts of Western Europe.

===Preclassic===
The art-making tradition of Mesoamerican people begins with the [[Olmec#Art|Olmec]] around 1400&amp;nbsp;BCE, during the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Preclassic era]]. These people are best known for making [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]] but also carved [[jade]], erected monumental architecture, made small-scale sculpture, and designed mosaic floors. Two of the most well-studied sites artistically are [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] and [[La Venta]]. After the Olmec culture declined, the [[Maya civilization]] became prominent in the region. Sometimes a transitional [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]] period is described, which is a hybrid of Olmec and Maya. A particularly well-studied Epi-Olmec site is [[La Mojarra]], which includes hieroglyphic carvings that have been partially deciphered.

===Classic===
[[File:Mascara Dios Murcielago.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] mosaic mask that represents a Bat god, made of 25 pieces of jade, with yellow eyes made of shell. It was found in a tomb at [[Monte Alban]]]]
By the late pre-Classic era, beginning around 400&amp;nbsp;BCE, the Olmec culture had declined but both Central Mexican and Maya peoples were thriving. Throughout much of the Classic period in Central Mexico, the city of [[Teotihuacan]] was thriving, as were [[Xochicalco]] and [[El Tajin]]. These sites boasted grand sculpture and architecture. Other Central Mexican peoples included the [[Mixtec#Language, codices, and artwork|Mixtecs]], the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]], and people in the [[Valley of Oaxaca]]. [[Maya art]] was at its height during the “Classic” period—a name that mirrors that of [[Classical antiquity|Classical European antiquity]]—and which began around 200 CE. Major Maya sites from this era include [[Copan]], where numerous stelae were carved, and [[Quirigua]] where the largest stelae of Mesoamerica are located along with [[zoomorphic]] altars. A complex [[writing system]] was developed, and [[Maya codices|Maya illuminated manuscripts]] were produced in large numbers on paper made from [[Bark (botany)|tree bark]]. Many sites [[Maya collapse|”collapsed”]] around 1000 CE.

===Postclassic===
At the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] during the 16th and 17th centuries, the Maya were still powerful, but many communities were paying tribute to [[Aztec society]]. The latter culture was thriving, and it included [[Aztec#Arts|arts]] such as sculpture, painting, and feather mosaics. Perhaps the most well-known work of Aztec art is the [[Aztec sun stone|calendar stone]], which became a national symbol of the state of [[Mexico]]. During the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], many of these artistic objects were sent to Europe, where they were placed in [[cabinets of curiosities]], and later redistributed to Western art museums. The Aztec empire was based in the city of [[Tenochtitlan]] which was largely destroyed during the colonial era. What remains of it was buried beneath [[Mexico City]]. A few buildings, such as the foundation of the [[Templo Mayor]] have since been unearthed by archaeologists, but they are in poor condition.

===Art in the Americas===
Art in the Americas since the conquest is characterized by a mixture of indigenous and foreign traditions, including those of European, African, and Asian settlers. Numerous indigenous traditions thrived after the conquest. For example, the [[Plains Indians]] created [[quillwork]], [[beadwork]], [[winter count]]s, [[ledger art]], and [[tipi]]s in the pre-reservation era, and afterwards became assimilated into the world of Modern and Contemporary art through institutions such as the [[Santa Fe Indian School]] which encouraged students to develop a unique Native American style. Many paintings from that school, now called the Studio Style, were exhibited at the [[Philbrook Museum of Art]] during its Indian annual held from 1946 to 1979.

Arising from the humblest beginnings as a nomadic group of "uncivilizated" wanderers, the Aztecs created the largets empire in Mesoamerican history, lasting from 1427/1428 to 1521. Tribute from conquered states provided the economic and artistic resources to tranform their capital [[Tenochtitlan]] (0ld [[Mexico City]]) into one of the wonders of the world. Artists from throught mesoamerica creted stunning artworks for their new maters, fashioning delicate golden objects of personal adornment and formidable sculptures of firece gods.

The Aztecs entered the Valley of Mexico (the area of modern [[Mexico City]]) in 1325 and within a centry had taken control of this lush  region brimming with powerful city-states.

Ancient Maya art refers to the material arts of the [[Maya civilization]], an eastern and south-eastern [[Mesoamerica]]n culture that took shape in the course of the later [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic Period]] (500 BCE to 200 CE). Its greatest artistic flowering occurred during the seven centuries of the {{C|Mayan Classic Period|Classic Period}} (c. 200 to 900 CE). Ancient Maya art then went through an extended Post-Classic phase before the upheavals of the sixteenth century destroyed courtly culture and put an end to the Mayan artistic tradition. Many regional styles existed, not always coinciding with the changing boundaries of Maya polities. [[Olmec]]s, [[Teotihuacan]] and [[Toltec]]s have all influenced Maya art. Traditional art forms have mainly survived in weaving and the design of peasant houses.

=== Costa Rica &amp; Panama ===
[[File:Panama, conte, pettorale in oro, 400-900 dc.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Pectoral from [[Panama]]; 400–900 CE; [[gold]]; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], US)]]
Long considered a backwater of culture and aesthetic expression, Central America's dynamic societies are now recognized as robust and innovative contribuitors to the arts of ancient Americas. The people of pre-Columbian Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama developed their own distinctive styles in spite of the region being a crossroads for millennia. Its peoples were not subsumed by outside influences but instead created, adopted and adapted al manner of ideas and technologies to suit their needs and temperaments. The region's isiosyncratic cultural traditions, religious beliefs and sociopolitical systems are reflected in unique artworks. A fundamental spiritual tenet was shamanism, the central principle of which decreedthat in a trance state, transformed into one's spirit companion form, a person could enter the supranatural realm and garner special power to affect worldly affairs. Central American artists devised ingenious ways to portray this transformation by merging into one figure human and animal characteristics; the [[jaguar]], [[Snake|serpent]] and avian raport (falcon, eagle or vulture) were the main spirit forms.

[[Gold]] — the perpetually brilliant metal of status, wealth and power — inspired the Spanish to explore the globe and was an essential accoutrement of prestige, authority and religious ideology among the people of Central America and Colombia.

In Colombia, gold was important for it's relationship to thedivine force of the sun. It was part of a complex ideology of universal binary oppositions: male-female, light-dark, the earth and spirit worlds. Gold body adornments were cast in complex forms, their iconography communicating social, political and spiritual potency through portrayals of powerful shaman-rulers, lineage totems and supranatural protector spirits.

The tropical climate of the Caraibbean islands and the Amazonian rainforest is not favorable to the preservation of artefacts made from wood and other materials. What survived reveals complex societies whose people created art rich in mythological and spiritual meaning.

The [[Taino people]], who occupied the Caraibbean islands when the Spanish arrived, were agriculturalists whose society was centred on hereditary chiefs called ''[[cacique]]s''. Their towns included impressively constructed ceremonial plazas in which ball games were played and religious rituals carried on, linking their culture to that of the Maya from the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. Much of Taino art was associated with shamanic rituals and religion, including a ritual in which a shaman or a ''cacique'' enters into a hypnotic state by inhaling the hallucinogetic ''[[cohoba]]'' powder. Sculptures representing the creator god Yocahu often depict a nude male figure in a squatting position with a slightly concave dish on top of his head, to hold the ''cohoba'' powder. Other figures (always male) stand rigidly frontal, the ostentatious display of their genitals apparently to the importance of fertility. The prupose of these rituals was communication with the ancestors and the spirit world. Chiefs and shamans (often the same person) sometimes interceded with spirit beings from a sculpted stool, or ''duho''.

Meanwhile, the [[Marajoara culture]] flourished on [[Marajó|Marajó island]] at the mouth of the [[Amazon River]], in Brazil. Archeologists have found sophisticated [[pottery]] in their excavations on the island. These pieces are large, and elaborately painted and incised with representations of plants and animals. These provided the first evidence that a complex society had existed on Marajó. Evidence of [[mound building]] further suggests that well-populated, complex and sophisticated settlements developed on this island, as only such settlements were believed capable of such extended projects as major earthworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grann|first=David|title=The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon|page=315|year=2009|isbn=978-0-385-51353-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery that they made is decorated with abastract lines and spirals, suggesting that they probably consumed hallucinogetic plants. The Marajoara culture produced many kinds of vessels including urns, jars, bottles, cups, bowls, plates and dishes.

Inuit art refers to [[Work of art|artwork]] produced by [[Inuit]] people, that is, the people of the Arctic previously known as [[Eskimo]]s, a term that is now often considered offensive outside [[Alaska]]. Historically, their preferred medium was [[walrus ivory]], but since the establishment of southern markets for Inuit art in 1945, [[Printmaking|prints]] and figurative works carved in relatively soft stone such as [[soapstone]], [[serpentinite]], or [[argillite]] have also become popular. The range of colors is cold, most encountered being: black, brown, grays, white and gray-blue.

[[Eastern world|Eastern civilization]] broadly includes Asia, and it also includes a complex tradition of art making. One approach to [[Eastern art history]] divides the field by nation, with foci on [[Indian art]], [[Chinese art]], and [[Japanese art]]. Due to the size of the continent, the distinction between Eastern Asia and Southern Asia in the context of arts can be clearly seen. In most of Asia, pottery was a prevalent form of art. The pottery is often decorated with geometric patterns or abstract representations of animals, people or plants. Another very widespread form of art was, and is, sculpture.

=== Central Asia ===
{{main|Central Asia#Arts|Scythian art}}[[File:Ceremonial hanging IMA 50671.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremonial hanging (suzani); late 1700s; cotton; 92 x 63{{fraction|1|4}} in.; from [[Uzbekistan]]; [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (USA)]]
Superb samples of [[Steppes art]] – mostly golden jewellery and trappings for horse – are found over vast expanses of land stretching from [[Hungary]] to [[Mongolia]]. Dating from the period between the 7th and 3rd centuries BCE, the objects are usually diminutive, as may be expected from nomadic people always on the move. Art of the steppes is primarily an [[animal style|animal art]], i.e., combat scenes involving several animals (real or imaginary) or single animal figures (such as golden stags) predominate. The best known of the various peoples involved are the [[Scythians]], at the European end of the steppe, who were especially likely to bury gold items.

Among the most famous finds was made in 1947, when the Soviet archaeologist [[Sergei Rudenko]] discovered a royal burial at [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk]], [[Altay Mountains]], which featured – among many other important objects – the most ancient extant [[pile rug]], probably made in Persia.  Unusually for prehistoric burials, those in the northern parts of the area may preserve organic materials such as wood and textiles that normally would decay.  Steppes people both gave and took influences from neighbouring cultures from Europe to China, and later Scythian pieces are heavily influenced by ancient Greek style, and probably often made by Greeks in Scythia.

The [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] made anthropomorphic figures. Most famous are the ''[[Dancing Girl (sculpture)|Dancing Girl]]'' and the ''[[Priest-King (figure)|Priest-King]]''. This civilisation made also many [[clay]] pots, most of them decorated with geometric patterns. They made seals decorated with animals, anthropomorphic figures and [[indus script|their script]]. The Indus script (also known as the Harappan script) is a corpus of symbols produced by the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] during the [[Kot Diji]] and [[Mature Harappan]] periods between 3500 and 1900 BCE. Most inscriptions containing these symbols are extremely short, making it difficult to judge whether or not  these symbols constituted a [[Writing system|script]] used to record a language, or even symbolise a [[writing system]].&lt;ref name="Locklear"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Mallory |last1=Locklear |quote="After a century of failing to crack an ancient script, linguists turn to machines." |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14371450/indus-valley-civilization-ancient-seals-symbols-language-algorithms-ai |title=Science: Machine learning could finally crack the 4,000-year-old Indus script |work=[[The Verge]] |location=Manhattan, New York |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of many attempts,&lt;ref&gt;(Possehl, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; the "script" has not yet been deciphered, but efforts are ongoing. There is no known [[bilingual inscription]] to help decipher the script, nor does the script show any significant changes over time.  However, some of the syntax (if that is what it may be termed) varies depending upon location.&lt;ref name="Locklear"/&gt;

Early [[Buddhists]] in India developed symbols related to [[Buddha]]. Bhutanese painted "[[thangkas]]" that shows Buddhist iconography. The major survivals of Buddhist art begin in the period after the Mauryans, from which good quantities of sculpture survives from some key sites such as [[Sanchi]], [[Bharhut]] and [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati]], some of which remain ''in situ'', with others in museums in India or around the world.  Stupas were surrounded by ceremonial fences with four profusely carved [[torana]]s or ornamental gateways facing the cardinal directions. These are in stone, though clearly adopting forms developed in wood. They and the walls of the stupa itself can be heavily decorated with reliefs, mostly illustrating the lives of the Buddha. Gradually life-size figures were sculpted, initially in deep relief, but then free-standing.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 26–47, 105–117&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Mathura]] was the most important centre in this development, which applied to Hindu and Jain art as well as Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 59–70&lt;/ref&gt;  The facades and interiors of rock-cut ''[[chaitya]]'' prayer halls and monastic ''[[vihara]]s'' have survived better than similar free-standing structures elsewhere, which were for long mostly in wood. The caves at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], [[Karla Caves|Karle]], [[Bhaja Caves|Bhaja]] and elsewhere contain early sculpture, often outnumbered by later works such as iconic figures of the Buddha and [[bodhisattva]]s, which are not found before 100 CE at the least.

=== Nepalese, Bhutanese &amp; Tibetan ===
{{Main|Nepalese art|Bhutanese art|Tibetan art}}

For more than a thousand years, [[Tibetan art]]ists have played a key role in the cultural life of Tibet. From designs for painted furniture to elaborate murals in religious buildings, their efforts have permeated virtually every facet of life on the [[Tibetan plateau]]. The vast majority of surviving artworks created before the mid-20th century are dedicated to the depiction of religious subjects, with the main forms being [[thangka]], [[distemper (paint)|distemper]] paintings on cloth, [[Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings]], and small statues in bronze, or large ones in clay, [[stucco]] or wood. They were commissioned by religious establishments or by pious individuals for use within the practice of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and were manufactured in large workshops by monks and lay artists, who are mostly unknown.

The art of Tibet may be studied in terms of influences which have contributed to it over the centuries, from other [[Chinese art|Chinese]], [[Newa art|Nepalese]], [[Indian art|Indian]], and [[sacred art|sacred]] styles. Many bronzes in Tibet that suggest [[Pala Empire|Pala]] influence, are thought to have been either crafted by Indian sculptors or brought from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://himalayanbuddhistart.wordpress.com/2016/10/16/pala-india-maitreya-standing/ |title=Pala India, Maitreya – standing |date=October 16, 2016 |access-date=29 September 2018 |work=Himalayanbuddhistart |publisher=[[WordPress.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhutanese art]] is similar to the [[art of Tibet]]. Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], with its pantheon of divine beings. The major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu|Kagyu School]] and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment). The Nyingma order is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]], who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century. According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find. The [[Terton|treasure finders]] ([[Terton|''tertön'']]) are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.

In Eastern Asia, painting was derived from the practice of calligraphy, and portraits and landscapes were painted on silk cloth. Most of the paintings represent landscapes or portraits. The  most spectacular sculptures are the [[Chinese ritual bronzes|ritual bronzes]] and the bronze sculptures from [[Sanxingdui]]. A very well-known example of Chinese art is the ''[[Terracotta Army]]'', depicting the armies of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first Emperor of China. It is a form of [[funerary art]] buried with the emperor in 210–209 BCE whose purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife.

Chinese art is one of the oldest continuous traditional arts in the world, and is marked by an unusual degree of continuity within, and consciousness of, that tradition, lacking an equivalent to the Western collapse and gradual recovery of classical styles. The media that have usually been classified in the West since the [[Renaissance]] as the [[decorative arts]] are extremely important in Chinese art, and much of the finest work was produced in large workshops or factories by essentially unknown artists, especially in [[Chinese ceramics]].

===Japanese===
{{main|Japanese art}}[[File:Kitagawa Utamaro - Toji san bijin (Three Beauties of the Present Day)From Bijin-ga (Pictures of Beautiful Women), published by Tsutaya Juzaburo - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Three Beauties of the Present Day]]'' (japanese: 当時三美人); by [[Kitagawa Utamaro]] c. 1793; height: 3.87 cm (15.23 in), width: 2.62 cm (10.31 in); [[Toledo Museum of Art]] ([[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Ohio]])]]
[[Japanese art]] covers a wide range of art styles and media, including [[Jōmon Pottery|ancient pottery]], [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]], [[Ink wash painting|ink painting]] and [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]] on silk and paper, ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' paintings and [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]], ceramics, [[origami]], and more recently [[manga]]—modern Japanese [[cartoon]]ing and comics—along with a myriad of other types. It has a long history, ranging from the beginnings of human habitation in Japan, sometime in the 10th millennium BCE, to the present.

The first settlers of Japan, the [[Jōmon]] people (c. 11,000–300 BCE). They crafted [[Jomon pottery|lavishly decorated pottery storage vessels]], clay figurines called ''[[dogū]]''. Japan has been subject to sudden invasions of new ideas followed by long periods of minimal contact with the outside world. Over time the Japanese developed the ability to absorb, imitate, and finally assimilate those elements of foreign culture that complemented their aesthetic preferences. The earliest complex art in Japan was produced in the 7th and 8th centuries in connection with [[Buddhism]]. In the 9th century, as the Japanese began to turn away from China and develop indigenous forms of expression, the secular arts became increasingly important; until the late 15th century, both religious and secular arts flourished. After the [[Ōnin War]] (1467–1477), Japan entered a period of political, social, and economic disruption that lasted for over a century. In the state that emerged under the leadership of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], organized religion played a much less important role in people's lives, and the arts that survived were primarily secular.

[[Korean art]]s include traditions in &lt;!--(alphabetical:)--&gt;calligraphy, music, painting and pottery, often marked by the use of natural forms, surface decoration and bold colors or sounds.

The earliest examples of Korean art consist of [[stone age]] works dating from 3000 BCE. These mainly consist of [[votive offering|votive sculptures]] and more recently, [[petroglyph]]s, which were rediscovered.

This early period was followed by the art styles of various Korean kingdoms and dynasties. Korean artists sometimes modified [[Chinese art|Chinese traditions]] with a native preference for simple elegance, spontaneity, and an appreciation for purity of nature.

The [[Goryeo]] Dynasty (918–1392) was one of the most prolific periods for a wide range of disciplines, especially pottery.

The Korean art market is concentrated in the [[Insadong]] district of [[Seoul]] where over 50 small galleries exhibit and occasional fine arts auctions. Galleries are cooperatively run, small and often with curated and finely designed exhibits. In every town there are smaller regional galleries, with local artists showing in traditional and contemporary media. Art galleries usually have a mix of media. Attempts at bringing Western conceptual art into the foreground have usually had their best success outside of Korea in New York, San Francisco, London and Paris.

=== Vietnamese ===
{{main|Vietnamese art}}[[File:ThienMuPagoda.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pagoda of the Celestial Lady]] ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: ''Chùa Thiên Mụ''; also called ''Linh Mụ Pagoda'') in [[Huế]], built in 1601]]
Vietnamese art has a long and rich history, the earliest examples of which date back as far as the [[Stone Age]] around 8,000 [[BCE]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

With the millennium of [[History of Vietnam|Chinese domination]] starting in the 2nd century BCE, Vietnamese art undoubtedly absorbed many Chinese influences, which would continue even following independence from China in the 10th century CE.  However, Vietnamese art has always retained many distinctively Vietnamese characteristics.

By the 19th century, the influence of [[French art]] took hold in Vietnam, having a large hand in the birth of modern Vietnamese art.

=== Thai ===
{{main|Thai art}}
[[File:WatPhraKeaw Ramayana Chariot.JPG|450px|thumb|[[Hanuman]] on his chariot, a scene from the [[Ramakien]] in [[Wat Phra Kaew]] ([[Bangkok]])]]

Traditional Thai art is primarily composed of [[Buddhist art]] and scenes from the Indian epics. Traditional Thai [[sculpture]] almost exclusively depicts [[Buddha image|images of the Buddha]], being very similar with the other styles from [[Southeast Asia]], such as [[Cambodian art|Khmer]]. Traditional Thai [[painting]]s usually consist of book illustrations, and painted ornamentation of buildings such as [[palace]]s and [[temple]]s. Over time, thai art was influenced by the other Asian styles, most by [[Indian art|Indian]] and [[Cambodian art|Khmer]]. Thai sculpture and painting, and the royal courts provided patronage, erecting temples and other religious shrines as acts of merit or to commemorate important events.

The history of Cambodian art stretches back centuries to ancient times, but the most famous period is undoubtedly the Khmer art of the [[Khmer Empire]] (802–1431), especially in the area around [[Angkor]] and the mainly 12th-century temple-complex of [[Angkor Wat]], initially [[Hindu]] and subsequently [[Buddhist]]. After the collapse of the empire these and other sites were abandoned and overgrown, allowing much of the era's stone carving and architecture to survive to the present day. Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include [[textiles]], non-textile [[weaving]], [[silversmithing]], [[stone carving]], [[lacquerware]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wat]] [[murals]], and [[kite]]-making.

Beginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs, and foreign tourists.

In pre-colonial Cambodia, art and crafts were generally produced either by rural non-specialists for practical use or by skilled artists producing works for the Royal Palace. In modern Cambodia, many artistic traditions entered a period of decline or even ceased to be practiced, but the country has experienced a recent artistic revival as the tourist market has increased and governments and NGOs have contributed to the preservation of Cambodian culture.

Indonesia also has experienced a long [[History of Indonesia|history]], with each period leaves a distinctive arts. From [[Prehistoric Indonesia|prehistoric]] cave paintings and [[megalithic]] ancestral statues of Central Sulawesi, tribal wooden carving traditions of [[Toraja]] and [[Asmat people]], graceful Hindu-Buddhist art of classical Javanese civilization which produced [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]], vivid [[Balinese Painting|Balinese paintings]] and [[Balinese dance|performing arts]], [[Islamic art]]s of [[Aceh]], to contemporary arts of modern Indonesian artists. Both Indonesian diversity and history add to complexity on defining and identifying what is Indonesian art.

Most famous Indonesian artworks are the puppets for [[Wayang]], is a form of [[puppet theatre]] art &lt;span lang="ur" dir="rtl"&gt;found&lt;/span&gt; in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia,&lt;ref name=brandon143/&gt; wherein a dramatic story is told through shadows thrown by puppets and sometimes combined with human characters.

African art includes both [[African sculpture|sculpture]], typified by the brass castings of the [[Benin art|Benin people]], as well as [[African folk art|folk art]]. Concurrent with the European Middle Ages, in the eleventh century CE a nation that made grand architecture, gold sculpture, and intricate jewelry was founded in [[Great Zimbabwe]]. Impressive sculpture was concurrently being cast from brass by the [[Yoruba art|Yoruba people]] of what is now Nigeria. Such a culture grew and was ultimately transformed to become the [[Benin art|Benin Kingdom]], where elegant altar tusks, brass heads, plaques of brass, and palatial architecture was created. The Benin Kingdom was ended by the British in 1897, and little of the culture's art now remains in Nigeria. Today, the most significant arts venue in Africa is the [[Johannesburg Biennale]].

Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by a high density of cultures. Notable are the, [[Edo people|Edo]], [[yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]] people anthe [[Nok civilization]] from Nigeria; [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] and [[Luba people]] from Central Africa; [[Ashanti people]] from Ghana; [[Zulu people]] from [[Southern Africa]]; and [[Fang people]] from [[Equatorial Guinea]] (85%), Cameroon and Gabon; the [[Sao civilization]] people from Chad; [[Kwele people]] from eastern Gabon, [[Republic of the Congo]] and Cameroon.

The Art of Oceania includes the geographic areas of [[Micronesia]], [[Polynesia]], Australia, New Zealand, and [[Melanesia]]. One approach treats the area thematically, with foci on [[ancestry]], warfare, the body, gender, trade, religion, and [[tourism]]. Unfortunately, little ancient art survives from Oceania. Scholars believe that this is likely because artists used perishable materials, such as wood and feathers, which did not survive in the tropical climate, and there are no historical records to refer to most of this material. The understanding of Oceania's artistic cultures thus begins with the documentation of it by Westerners, such as Captain [[James Cook]], in the eighteenth century. At the turn of the twentieth century the French artist [[Paul Gauguin]] spent significant amounts of time in Tahiti, living with local people and making modern art—a fact that has become intertwined with Tahitian visual culture to the present day.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} The indigenous [[Australian art|art of Australia]] often looks like abstract modern art, but it has deep roots in local culture.

The art of [[Oceania]] is the last great tradition of art to be appreciated by the world at large. Despite being one of the longest continuous traditions of art in the world, dating back at leasf fifty millennia, it remained relatively unknown until the second half of the 20th century.

The often ephemeral materials of Aboriginal art of Australia makes it difficult to determine the antiquity of the majority of the forms of art practised today. The most durable forms are the multitudes of rock engravings and rock paintings which are found across the continent. In the Arnhem Land escarpment, evidence suggests that paintings were being made fifty thousand years ago, antedating the Palaeolithic rock paintings of [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]] &amp; [[Lascaux]] in Europe.

===Origins===

Art historians disagree when [[Modern art]] began, some tracing it as far back as [[Francisco Goya]] in the [[Napoleonic]] period, the mid-19th century with the [[industrial revolution]] or the late 19th century with the advent of [[Impressionism]]. The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 gave rise to further revolutions in thought. In the arts, these included a new self-consciousness about artistic styles and individuality.&lt;ref&gt;Ozenfant, A. (1952). ''Foundations of Modern Art''. New York: Dover Publications. pp. 2–5. {{OCLC|536109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[H. Harvard Arnason]] says "a gradual metamorphosis took place in the course of a hundred years", marked by significant events such as the completion in 1784 of [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s painting ''[[The Oath of the Horatii]]''; the exhibition of [[Gustave Courbet]]'s painting ''[[The Artist's Studio]]'' in 1855; and the exhibition of [[Édouard Manet]]'s painting ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' in the ''[[Salon des Refusés]]'' in Paris in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Arnason, H. Harvard (1998). ''History of Modern Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, Photography''. Fourth Edition. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc. p. 17. {{ISBN|0-8109-3439-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] tendency of early modern artists such as [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] was succeeded by newer art movements: [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]],  [[Impressionism]], [[post-Impressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], and other movements. Western artists were influenced by Eastern decorative arts, especially [[Japonism|Japanese prints]].

The Impressionists sought to convey movement, spontaneity, and transient effects of light in their work. Their style was adopted by artists in many countries, alongside national movements such as the [[Hudson River School]] and the [[Ashcan School]] in the US.

The history of [[20th-century art]] is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. The art movements of [[Fauvism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], [[abstract art]], [[Dada]]ism and [[Surrealism]] led to further explorations of new creative styles and manners of expression. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art, such as [[Pablo Picasso]] being influenced by [[Iberian sculpture]], [[African art|African sculpture]] and [[Primitivism]]. [[Japonism]], and Japanese [[woodcut]]s (which had themselves been influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on Impressionism and subsequent artistic developments. The influential example set by [[Paul Gauguin]]'s interest in [[Oceanic art]] and the sudden popularity among the [[Connoisseur|cognoscenti]] in early 20th century Paris of newly discovered African fetish sculptures and other works from non-European cultures were taken up by Picasso, [[Henri Matisse]], and many of their colleagues. Later in the 20th century, [[Pop Art]] and [[Abstract Expressionism]] came to prominence.

Rapid advances in science and technology led to the late Modern and [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] period. In these periods, the art and cultures of the world went through many changes, and there was a great deal of intermixture between cultures, as new [[mass media|communications technologies]] facilitated the national and even global dissemination of music, art and style. The separation of regional cultures that had marked the 19th century was replaced by a global culture. Postmodernism describes a broad movement that developed in the mid- to late-20th century across philosophy, the arts, architecture, and criticism which marked a departure from modernism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/postmodernism |title=Postmodernism |work=[[Oxford Dictionaries]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |first=Ruth |last=Reichl |author-link=Ruth Reichl |date=1989 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html |dictionary=[[American Heritage Dictionary]] |title=postmodern |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209075319/http://www.bartleby.com/61/26/P0472600.html |archive-date=9 December 2008 |access-date=29 September 2018 |edition=4th |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=The Symbolic Function of Transmodernity |journal=Language and Psychoanalysis |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=68–87 |url=https://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |doi=10.7565/landp.2012.0005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008211951/http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |archive-date=8 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Art_(blue).jpg|thumb|[[Genco Gulan]], Art (Blue) (2013)]]

'''Idea art''', is an [[art]] form in which small individual [[idea]](s) and not the grand [[concept]](s) or ideologies involved in the work take precedence over generic [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], material and disciplinary concerns.
Works of idea art may be in text, [[found object]], 2d, 3d, moving images, sound, performance, digital, interactive media and/ or as installations. This method was fundamental to Turkish artist [[Genco Gulan]]'s definition of idea art, one of the first to appear online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openspaceistanbul.co.uk/genco-gulan/|title=Idea art definition by Genco Gulan| archivedate=June 2016|publisher=Open Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In idea art the idea is the most important aspect of the art work. It may be start a project and/ or maybe attached to it later, after he or she finishes the production. In this way, the artist not only works like and [[architect]] or an engineer, as in the case of [[conceptual art]] but also works like a [[curator]] and/ or an art writer.

Idea art should not be confused with idealism or in other words, perfectualism. Individual ideas for art should not be perfect or beautiful but appropriate.

The '''Joint Institute for Nuclear Research''' ('''JINR''', {{lang-ru|Объединённый институт ядерных исследований, ОИЯИ}}), in [[Dubna]], [[Moscow Oblast]] (110&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Moscow]]), [[Russia]], is an international research center for [[Nuclear Science|nuclear sciences]], with 5500 staff members, 1200 [[researcher]]s including 1000 [[Ph.D]]s from eighteen member states (including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus and Kazakhstan). Most scientists, however, are eminent [[Russian scientists]].

The Institute has seven laboratories, each with its own specialisation: [[theoretical physics]], [[high energy physics]] (particle physics), [[heavy ion]] physics, condensed matter physics, nuclear reactions, [[neutron]] physics, and [[information technology]]. The institute has a division to study radiation and radiobiological research and other ad hoc experimental physics experiments.

Principal research instruments include a nuclotron superconductive [[particle accelerator]] (particle [[energy]]: 7 [[GeV]]), three isochronic cyclotrons (120, 145, 650 MeV), a phasotron (680 MeV) and a [[synchrophasotron]] (4 GeV). The site has a [[neutron]] fast-pulse [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] (1500MW pulse) with nineteen associated instruments receiving neutron beams.

==Founding==
The Joint Institute for Nuclear Research was established on the basis of an agreement signed on March 26, 1956 in [[Moscow]] by representatives of the governments of the eleven founding countries, with a view to combining their scientific and material potential. The USSR contributed 50 percent, the People's Republic of China 20 percent. On February 1, 1957, JINR was registered by the [[United Nations]]. The Institute is located in [[Dubna]], 120 km north of [[Moscow]].

At the time of the creation of JINR, the Institute of Nuclear Problems (INP) of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR already existed at the site of the future Dubna since the late 1940s, and it launched a program of fundamental and applied research at the [[synchrocyclotron]]. The Electrophysics Laboratory of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (EFLAN) was established, and under the guidance of Academician [[Vladimir Veksler]], work began to create a new accelerator - a proton synchrophasotron - with a record energy of 10 GeV at that time.

By the mid-1950s, there was a worldwide consensus that nuclear science should be accessible and that only broad cooperation could ensure the progressive development of this research, as well as the peaceful use of atomic energy. Thus, in 1954, near CERN, CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) was established. At about the same time, the countries that belonged to the socialist community decided to establish a Joint Institute for Nuclear Research on the basis of the INP and EFLAN.

The first director of the United Institute was Professor D. I. Blokhintsev, who just completed the creation of [[Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant]] the world's first nuclear power plant in [[Obninsk]]. The first vice-directors of JINR were professors [[Marian Danysz]] (Poland) and V. Votruba (Czechoslovakia).

The history of the formation of the United Institute is connected with the names of such prominent scientists and leaders of science as [[Nikolay Bogolyubov]], [[Leopold Infeld]], [[Igor Kurchatov]] , G. Nevodnichansky, AM Petrosyants, E. Slavsky, [[Igor Tamm]], A. V. Topchiev, H. Hulubey, L. Janos and others.

In the formation of the main scientific directions and the development of the Institute, outstanding physicists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newuc.jinr.ru/img_sections/file/pract08/30.06/JINR-eng-2008.pdf |format=PDF |title=International Intergovermental Organization Joint Institute for Nuclear Research |publisher=[[Laboratory of High Energies of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] |date=July 18, 2008 |accessdate=August 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823061058/http://newuc.jinr.ru/img_sections/file/pract08/30.06/JINR-eng-2008.pdf |archivedate=August 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;:

'''Mach tuck''' is an [[aerodynamic]] effect whereby the nose of an [[aircraft]] tends to [[Pitch (flight)|pitch]] downward as the airflow around the wing reaches [[supersonic]] speeds; the aircraft will first experience this effect at significantly below [[Mach number|Mach]] 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Transonic flow patterns.svg|thumb|right|Shock wave above wing moves rearwards as aircraft speed approaches Mach 1]]

==Causes==
Mach tuck is usually caused by two things, a rearward movement of the [[center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|centre of pressure]] of the wing and a decrease in wing downwash velocity at the tailplane both of which cause a nose down pitching moment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ce560xl.com/files/High_Altitude_Aerodynamics.pdf critical aspects of mach flight e.&lt;/ref&gt; For a particular aircraft design only one of these may be significant in causing a tendency to dive, delta-winged aircraft with no foreplane or tailplane in the first case and, for example, the [[Lockheed P-38]]&lt;ref&gt;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930092690.pdf p.4&lt;/ref&gt; in the second case. Alternatively, a particular design may have no significant tendency, for example the [[Fokker F28 Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;http://rahauav.com/Library/Aerodynamic/Aerodynamic_design_of_transport_aircraft_www.rahaUAV.com.pdf p.379&lt;/ref&gt;

As an aerofoil generating lift moves through the air, the air flowing over the top surface accelerates to a higher local speed than the air flowing over the bottom surface. When the aircraft speed reaches its [[critical Mach number]] the accelerated airflow locally reaches the speed of sound and creates a small shock wave, even though the aircraft is still travelling below the speed of sound.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J. (1975) ''Aerodynamics'', section 11.10, Pitman Publishing Limited, London. {{ISBN|0 273 01120 0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region in front of the shock wave generates high lift. As the aircraft itself flies faster, the shock wave over the wing gets stronger and moves rearwards, creating high lift further back along the wing. This rearward movement of lift causes the aircraft to tuck or pitch nose-down.

The severity of Mach tuck on any given design is affected by the thickness of the aerofoil, the sweep angle of the wing, and the location of the tailplane relative to the main wing.{{explain|date=October 2016}}

A tailplane which is positioned further aft can provide a larger stabilizing pitch-up moment.

The [[Camber (aerodynamics)|camber]] and thickness of the aerofoil affect the critical Mach number, with a more highly curved upper surface causing a lower critical Mach number.

On a swept wing the shock wave typically forms first at the [[wing root]], especially if it is more cambered than the [[wing tip]]. As speed increases, the shock wave and associated lift extend outwards and, because the wing is swept, backwards.

The changing airflow over the wing can reduce the [[downwash]] over a conventional tailplane, promoting a stronger nose-down pitching moment.

Another problem with a separate horizontal stabiliser is that it can itself achieve local supersonic flow with its own shock wave. This can affect the operation of a conventional elevator control surface.

Aircraft without enough elevator authority to maintain trim and fly level can enter a steep, sometimes unrecoverable dive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the aircraft is supersonic, the faster top shock wave can reduce the authority of the elevator and horizontal stabilizers.&lt;ref name="selkirk"&gt;[http://selair.selkirk.bc.ca/aerodynamics1/High-Speed/Page2e.html Transonic Aircraft Design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614103204/http://selair.selkirk.bc.ca/aerodynamics1/High-Speed/Page2e.html |date=2007-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All transonic and supersonic aircraft experience Mach tuck.

==Recovery==
Recovery is sometimes impossible in subsonic aircraft; however, as an aircraft descends into lower, warmer, denser air, [[control authority]] may return because drag tends to slow the aircraft while the speed of sound and control authority both increase.

To prevent Mach stall from progressing, the pilot should keep the airspeed below the type's critical Mach number by reducing [[throttle]], extending [[air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]], and if possible, extending the [[landing gear]].

==Design features==

A number of design techniques are used to counter the effects of Mach tuck.

On both conventional tailplane and [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] foreplane configurations, the horizontal stabiliser may be made large and powerful enough to correct the large trim changes associated with Mach tuck. In place of the conventional elevator control surface, the whole stabiliser may be made moveable or "all-flying", sometimes called a [[stabilator]]. This both increases the authority of the stabilizer over a wider range of aircraft pitch, but also avoids the controllability issues associated with a separate elevator.&lt;ref name="selkirk" /&gt;

Aircraft that fly supersonic for long periods, such as [[Concorde]], may compensate for Mach tuck by moving fuel between tanks in the fuselage to change the position of the [[centre of mass]] to match  the changing location of the centre of pressure, thereby minimize the amount of aerodynamic trim required.

A Mach trimmer is a device which varies the pitch trim automatically as a function of Mach number to oppose Mach tuck and maintain level flight.

==History==
[[File:Lockheed P-38H Lightning - 1.jpg|thumb|The [[P-38 Lightning]] gave [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] engineers a great deal of initial design trouble because it was so fast that it was the first American aircraft to experience [[Compressibility#Aeronautical dynamics|compressibility]] and Mach tuck.]] The fastest [[Air warfare of World War II|World War II fighters]] were the first aircraft to experience Mach tuck.   Their wings were not designed to counter Mach tuck because research on supersonic airfoils was just beginning; areas of supersonic flow, together with shock waves and flow separation,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John D. Jr. ''Introduction to Flight'', Third Edition, McGraw Hill Book Company, {{ISBN|0-07-001641-0}}, Figure 5.17 point c and Figure 5.20&lt;/ref&gt; were present on the wing. This condition was known at the time as compressibility burble and was known to exist on propeller tips at high aircraft speeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1935/naca-tn-543.pdf NACA Report]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[P-38 Lightning|P-38]] was the first 400&amp;nbsp;mph fighter, and it suffered more than the usual teething troubles.&lt;ref name=Bodie&gt;Bodie, Warren M. ''The Lockheed P-38 Lightning: The Definitive Story of Lockheed's P-38 Fighter''. Hayesville, North Carolina: Widewing Publications, 2001, 1991. {{ISBN|0-9629359-5-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a thick, high-lift wing,  distinctive [[twin boom]]s and a single, central [[nacelle]] containing the cockpit and armament.  It quickly accelerated to terminal velocity in a dive. The short stubby fuselage had a detrimental effect in reducing the critical Mach number of the 15% thick wing center section with high velocities over the canopy adding to those on the upper surface of the wing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1947/naca-rm-a7c24.pdf NACA Report] p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Mach tuck occurred at speeds above Mach&amp;nbsp;0.65;&lt;ref name=erickson&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a800790.pdf Erickson report] p.3&lt;/ref&gt; the air flow over the wing center section became [[Transonic speed|transonic]], causing a loss of lift. The resultant change in downwash at the tail caused a nose-down pitching moment and the dive to steepen (Mach tuck). The aircraft was very stable in this condition&lt;ref name=erickson
/&gt; making recovery from the dive very difficult. Dive recovery (auxiliary)&lt;ref&gt;Abzug and Larrabee, ''Airplane Stability and Control'', Cambridge University Press 2002, {{ISBN|0-521-02128-6}}, p.165&lt;/ref&gt; flaps were added to the underside of the wing (P-38J-LO) to increase the wing lift and downwash at the tail to allow recovery from transonic dives.

For example, a manual override in [[photography]] refers to the ability for the human photographer to turn off the automatic [[aperture]] sizing, [[automatic focus]]ing, or any other automated system on the camera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambitions4.com/Glossary-Pub-View-Topic-Details.asp?GlossaryID=339&amp;strChar=M Manual override] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060513202632/http://www.ambitions4.com/Glossary-Pub-View-Topic-Details.asp?GlossaryID=339&amp;strChar=M |date=2006-05-13 }}, Ambitions Photography Academy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some manual overrides can be used to veto an automated system's judgment when the system is in error. An example of this is a [[Printer (computing)|printer's]] ink level detection: in one case, a researcher found that when he overrode the system, up to 38% more pages could be printed at good quality by the printer than the automated system would have allowed.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3035500.stm 'Raw deal' on printer ink], ''[[BBC]]'', 3 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Automated systems are becoming increasingly common and integrated into everyday objects such as [[automobile]]s and [[domestic appliance]]s.  This development of [[ubiquitous computing]] raises general issues of policy and law about the need for manual overrides for matters of great importance such as life-threatening situations and major economic decisions.  The loyalty of such autonomous devices then becomes an issue.  If they follow rules installed by the manufacturer or required by law and refuse to cede control in some situations then the owners of the devices may feel disempowered, alienated and lacking true ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jjbohn.com/papers/langhein_aswemaylive_2002.pdf |title=As we may live – Real-world implications of ubiquitous computing |author1=Marc Langheinrich |author2=Vlad Coroama |author3=Jurgen Bohn |author4=Michael Rohs  |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Institute of Information Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major incidents==
[[China Airlines Flight 140]] crashed, causing many deaths, due to a misunderstanding about the manual overrides for the [[autopilot]].  The Take-Off/Go Around system had been activated to abort a landing.  It was programmed to ignore manual controls in this situation but the human pilots tried to continue the landing.  The conflicting control signals from the pilots and autopilot then resulted in the aircraft stalling and crashing.  The autopilot for this aircraft type was then reprogrammed so that it would never ignore a manual override.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SG07muS_S2EC |page=151 |year=2004 |title=Taming HAL: designing interfaces beyond 2001 |isbn=978-0-312-29574-5 |author=Asaf Degani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''most probable number''' method, otherwise known as the method of [[Poisson process|Poisson]] zeroes, is a method of getting quantitative data on concentrations of discrete items from positive/negative (incidence) data.

There are many discrete entities that are easily detected but difficult to count.  Any sort of amplification reaction or [[catalyst|catalysis]] reaction obliterates easy quantification but allows presence to be detected very sensitively.  Common examples include [[bacterial growth|microorganism growth]], [[enzyme]] action, or catalytic chemistry.  The MPN method involves taking the original solution or sample, and subdividing it by orders of magnitude (frequently 10&amp;times; or 2&amp;times;), and assessing presence/absence in multiple subdivisions.  

The degree of dilution at which absence begins to appear indicates that the items have been diluted so much that there are many subsamples in which none appear.  A suite of replicates at any given concentration allow finer resolution, to use the number of positive and negative samples to estimate the original concentration within the appropriate order of magnitude.

In microbiology, the cultures are incubated and assessed by eye, bypassing tedious colony counting or expensive and tedious microscopic counts. Presumptive, Confirmative and Completed tests are a part of MPN

In molecular biology, a common application involves [[DNA]] templates diluted into [[polymerase chain reaction]]s (PCR).  Reactions only proceed when a template is present, allowing for a form of quantitative PCR, to assess the original concentration of template molecules.  Another application involves diluting enzyme stocks into solution containing a chromogenic substrate, or diluting antigens into solutions for [[ELISA]] (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) or some other antibody cascade detection reaction, to measure the original concentration of the enzyme or antigen.

The major weakness of MPN methods is the need for large numbers of replicates at the appropriate dilution to narrow the confidence intervals.  However, it is a very important method for counts when the appropriate order of magnitude is unknown ''a priori'' and sampling is necessarily destructive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5975">'''Nanophytoplankton''' are particularly small [[phytoplankton]] with sizes between 2 and 20&amp;nbsp;µm. They are the [[autotrophic]] part of [[nanoplankton]]. Like other phytoplankton, nanophytoplankton are microscopic organisms that obtain energy through the process of photosynthesis and must therefore live in the upper sunlit layer of ocean or other bodies of water. These microscopic free-floating organisms, including [[algae]], and [[cyanobacteria]], fix large amounts of [[carbon]] which would otherwise be released as [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/phytoplankton phytoplankton] Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nanophytoplankton in the ecosystem==
Phytoplankton form the beginning of the food chain for aquatic animals.  [[Zooplankton]] and [[krill]] feed on nanophytoplankton, which are then eaten by whales, seals, birds, fish, squid, and other organisms.&lt;ref name = "four"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s735612.htm|title=News in Science - Phytoplankton implicated in global warming - 27/11/2002|author=|date=|website=www.abc.net.au|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle==
Populations are low in the winter, when nutrients are high, and then the populations increase as the nanophytoplankton consume nearly all of the nutrients, reach their [[carrying capacity]], and decline in number at the end of the summer, beginning the cycle again in the winter.  However, nanophytoplankton have different seasonal cycles depending on which oceanic biome of the world they live in.&lt;ref name = "four"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "five"&gt;Stonehouse, B. ''Polar Ecology''. New York: Chapman and Hall, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrient uptake==
Phytoplanktons’ density (1.02 g/cm^3) is higher than that of sea water (1.00 g/cm^3).  Therefore, they sink in the ocean, unless there is an upward movement of water.  However, nanophytoplankton, with as small as a 1&amp;nbsp;µm radius, can swim in the ocean, but at a very slow rate, like “a human swimming in molasses.”  In either case, movement of water past the organism is created, allowing it to grab nutrients passing by.  To supply nutrients through their boundary layer, nanophytoplankton employ diffusion more effectively than swimming, however.&lt;ref name = "four"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "five"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mann, K. H. and Lazier, J.R.N. ''Dynamics of Marine Ecosystems III''. Australia: Blackwell Publishing, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antarctic nanophytoplankton==
In the [[Southern Ocean]] in the Antarctic zone, nanophytoplankton are the most abundant type of plankton in terms of number, but not volume.  Antarctic marine flora consists almost entirely of algae, with phytoplankton, and therefore nanophytoplankton, being the most numerous type, as having great importance.  Nanophytoplankton growth has been seen in pack-ice, covering nearly 73% of the Southern Ocean by the end of the winter.  They even grow on icebergs.  Nanophytoplankton production is affected by light intensity and duration, ice, surface water stability, and currents.  Also, availability of silicates, a nutrient for the organism, can affect photosynthetic efficiency and cell composition.&lt;ref&gt;Laws, R. M. ''Antarctic Ecology''. Orlando: Academic Press Inc., 1984&lt;/ref&gt;  Nanophytoplankton also require vitamins.  They thrive in areas of shallow water where there is upwelling and mixing.  Although optimal growth for the species occurs in water 5-7&amp;nbsp;°C, growth still occurs in Antarctic waters, which can reach as low as -2&amp;nbsp;°C.  Limitation of light intensity and duration is another factor for survival.  In Antarctica, the sun’s lower position above the horizon reduces light due to increased reflection, and the stormy seas reduce transmission of light due to bubble formations.  However, some Antarctic nanophytoplankton seem to be adapted to low light levels.  Most phytoplankton exist in warmer, equatorial waters.  For example, in the northwestern [[Philippine Sea]], the average number of nanophytoplankton was 1x10^4/l.  It is the nanophytoplankton in particular that seem to survive better under the conditions provided by the oceans of the Antarctic.  A physiological change in the cells must have occurred to allow this phenomenon.  Low [[salinity]] is desirable for survival, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, Waldo and Llano, George. ''Biology of the Antarctic Seas XI''. Washington D.C.: American Geophysical Union, 1971.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on global warming==
Continued global warming will significantly alter the food chain on Earth.  With nanophytoplankton and phytoplankton at the base of the food chain, their decreased productivity from increased [[Ultraviolet|UV-B]] radiation from ozone depletion will provide less food for krill and subsequent organisms in the food chain.  Antarctica has experienced up to 50% [[ozone depletion]], harming nanophytoplankton located here the most.  Through carbon fixation, nanophytoplankton absorb carbon from the atmosphere, and with depleting populations, more carbon is left in the air, contributing to more global warming and ozone depletion.  The cycle then continues.  However, some scientists believe that existence of nanophytoplankton contributes to further progression of global warming, because they absorb the sun’s radiation that would otherwise be reflected back into space.  Despite the controversy, it is evident that nanophytoplankton, albeit their minimal size and apparent irrelevance because they are hardly visible, are an integral part of sustaining life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ess-home.com/news/global-warming/ozone-depletion.asp|title=Global Warming and Ozone Depletion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=ess-home.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9309">'''Nuclear art''' was an artistic tendency developed  by some artists and painters, after the bombings of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].

==Conception and origins==
In the days, weeks and years following the atomic bombing of Japan, trained and untrained artists who survived the bombings began documenting their experiences in artworks.&lt;ref name="MIT Ground Zero"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. occupation authorities controlled the release of photographs and film footage of these events, while photographers and artists on the ground continued to produce visual representations of the effects of nuclear warfare. Photographer [[Yōsuke Yamahata]] began taking photographs of Nagasaki on August 10, 1945 (the day after the bombing), however his photographs were not released to the public until 1952 when the magazine ''[[Asahi Gurafu]]'' published them.&lt;ref name="Unforgettable Fire" &gt;{{cite book

===Historical nuclear art in Italy===
In 1948, the artistic movement of [[Eaismo]], published a manifesto illustrating some aspects of the [[atomic age]] and, at the same time, criticizing the industrial use of [[nuclear power]].&lt;ref &gt;G.Favati, V.Fontani, M.Landi, A.Neri, A.S.Pellegrini, Manifesto dell'Eaismo, Società Editrice Italiana, [[Livorno]], 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a movement of poetry and painting, founded by the Italian artist [[Voltolino Fontani]], aiming to balance the role of men in a society upset by  the danger  of [[nuclear radiation]].&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web
  |first=Maria  |last=Grandinetti

  |accessdate=1 April 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic group was strengthened by the poet [[Marcello Landi]] and by the literary critic Guido Favati. In 1948 Voltolino Fontani depicted the disintegration and fragmentation of an [[atom]] on canvas, by creating the artwork: ''Dinamica di assestamento e mancata stasi''.

In 1951 the painters [[Enrico Baj]] and Sergio Dangelo created the {{illm|Arte nucleare movement|it}},  criticizing and putting the repetitiveness of painting (as an artistic and commercial phenomenon) in discussion.&lt;ref &gt;Luciano Caramel, Arte in Italia, 1945-1960, Vita e Pensiero, [[Milano]] 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
Plenty of Italian artists, in [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and foreigners like [[Yves Klein]], [[Asger Jorn]], [[Arman]], [[Antonio Saura]] joined the movement. The main representative of the arte nucleare movement was [[Piero Manzoni]], who in this context, for the first time in his life, put  his talent in evidence.&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.pieromanzoni.org/biografia_1933-57.htm, ''link read in April 2011'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Eaismo, recommending artists to pursue painting values (and poetry),&lt;ref &gt;G.Favati, V.Fontani, M.Landi, A.Neri, A.S.Pellegrini, Manifesto dell'Eaismo, Società Editrice Italiana, [[Livorno]], 1948&lt;/ref&gt; the arte nucleare movement tried to promote a new form of art in which painting was marginalized.&lt;ref &gt;[http://digilander.libero.it/contemporarea/AAI/ant38, Arman, Baj, Bemporad, Bertini, Colonne, Chapmans, Colucci, Dangelo, De Miceli, D'Haese, Hoeboer, Hundertwasser, Klein, Koenig, Manzoni, Nando, Noiret, A. e G.

===Historical nuclear art in Spain=== 
In the meantime, Spanish painter [[Salvador Dalì]] published the [[Mystical manifesto]] (1951), putting catholic mysticism and nuclear themes together.
In this period Dalì created artworks like [[Idillio atomico]] (1945) and [[Leda Atomica]] (1949).

===Historical nuclear art in France===

In 1949  the French artist [[Bernard Lorjou]] started to paint his monumental artwork “l’age atomique”  (The atomic age). The painting was concluded after one year and is now located in the [[Centre Pompidou]].

===Historical nuclear art in the United States===

The painter and photographer [[Eugene Von Bruenchenhein]] painted the artwork “Atomic age” in 1955,&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.ktfineart.com/past/?object_id=86&amp;show=project_images&amp;heading_id=&amp;project_id=90&amp;detail_id=602, link read in 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and other apocalyptical and post apocalyptical paintings up to 1965.

The British sculptor, [[Henry Moore]], created a bronze public sculpture, entitled, [[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)]] (1967) that depicted both the fatality of nuclear weapons as well as celebrated the invention of nuclear energy for use as electrical power. The sculpture is located on the grounds of the University of Chicago, where the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction was produced at the [[Chicago Pile-1]], under the oversight of the Manhattan Project and Enrico Fermi. The sculpture is in the form of a hybrid [[mushroom cloud]] and human skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Contemporary approaches to nuclear art==

===Japan===
After the March 2011 accident that caused three nuclear reactors to melt down at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan, there have been numerous responses by contemporary Japanese artists, including Shigenobu Yoshida, [[Tatsuo Miyajima]], [[Shimpei Takeda]], [[Fuyuki Yamakawa]], Iri and Toshi Maruki, and Hiroshima bomb survivor, Tadasi Tonoshiki.&lt;ref name="WEAD Atomic Legacy Art"&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Pokeberries.png|thumb|right|200px|Long, magenta peduncles on an [[Phytolacca americana|American pokeweed]], each supporting many small [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]].]]

[[File:Cyperus scapes IMG 5322p.JPG|thumb|''Cyperus'' scapes. Contrast with peduncle of ''Agave'']]
In [[botany]], a '''peduncle''' is a stem supporting an [[inflorescence]], or after [[fecundation]], an [[infructescence]].&lt;ref name= "ShastriV"&gt;Shashtri, Varun. Dictionary of Botany. Publisher: Isha Books 2005. {{ISBN|978-8182052253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peduncle is a [[Plant stem|stem]], usually green, though some peduncles are more or less florally colored or neutral in color, having no particular pigmentation. In some species, peduncles are leafless, though others bear small leaves, or even [[cataphyll]]s, at nodes; such leaves generally may be regarded as [[bract]]s.  The peduncle is the inflorescence base without flowers. When an unbranched peduncle has no obvious nodes, rises directly from a bulb or stem, and especially if it rises apparently directly from the ground, it commonly is referred to as a [[Scape (botany)|scape]].&lt;ref name= "ShastriV"/&gt;

The [[acorn]]s of the [[pedunculate oak]] are borne on a long peduncle, hence the name of the tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8166">A '''periodic sentence ''' is a [[stylistic device]] employed at the sentence level, described as one that is not complete grammatically or semantically before the final clause or phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cicero|first=Marcus Tullius|authorlink=Cicero|editor=Stephen Ciraolo|title=Pro Caelio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=huar3SdjthAC&amp;pg=PA3|edition=2|year=1999|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|isbn=978-0-86516-461-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The periodic sentence emphasizes its main idea by placing it at the end, following all the [[subordinate clauses]] and other [[Grammatical modifier|modifiers]] that support the principal idea.&lt;ref name="Baldwin1909"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=Charles Sears|title=Composition, Oral and Written|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3BLAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA122|accessdate=7 July 2011|year=1909|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|page=122}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence unfolds gradually, so that the thought contained in the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]/[[verb]] group only emerges at the sentence's conclusion.&lt;ref name=harmon/&gt; Obviously artificial, it is used mostly in what in [[Eloquence|oratory]] is called the grand style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cicero|first=Marcus Tullius|authorlink=Cicero|editor=Harold C. Gotoff|title=Cicero's Caesarian speeches: a stylistic commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAokWH3m1aEC&amp;pg=PA279|year=1993|publisher=UNC Press|isbn=978-0-8078-4407-6|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the opposite of the [[loose sentence]], also continuous or running style, where the subject and verb are introduced at the beginning of the sentence.&lt;ref name=harmon&gt;{{cite book|last=Harmon|first=William|title=A handbook to literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nyrzAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22periodic+sentence%22+snowflakes&amp;dq=%22periodic+sentence%22+snowflakes|edition=10|year=2006|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-134442-6|page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Periodic sentences often rely on [[hypotaxis]], whereas running sentences are typified by [[parataxis]].&lt;ref name=routledge&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Ronald Carter (linguist)|last1=Carter|first1=Ronald|last2=McRae|first2=John|title=The Routledge history of literature in English: Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRR7nR8qOAMC&amp;pg=PA475|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-24317-9|page=475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cicero]] is generally considered to be the master of the periodic sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chevalier|first=Tracy|title=Encyclopedia of the essay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJtz0iWO4O4C&amp;pg=PA179|year=1997|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-884964-30-5|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
In English literature, the decline of the periodic sentence's popularity goes hand in hand with the development toward a less formal style, which some authors date to the beginning of the Romantic period, specifically the 1798 publication of the ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', and the prevalence in twentieth-century literature of spoken language over written language.&lt;ref name=routledge/&gt; In American literature, scholars note the explicit rejection by [[Henry David Thoreau]] of the formal style of his time, of which the periodic sentence was characteristic; in his journal, Thoreau criticized those sentences as the "weak and flowing periods of the politician and scholar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillman|first=Richard H.|editor=Richard Fleming, Michael Payne|title=New interpretations of American literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=llypsBvOimUC&amp;pg=PA93|year=1988|publisher=Bucknell UP|isbn=978-0-8387-5127-5|page=93|chapter=Thoreau's Philosophy of Style}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical and literary usage==
According to [[William Harmon]], the periodic sentence is used "to arouse interest and curiosity, to hold an idea in suspense before its final revelation."&lt;ref name=harmon/&gt; In the words of [[William Minto]], "the effect...is to keep the mind in a state of uniform or increasing tension until the ''dénouement''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minto|first=William|authorlink=William Minto|title=A manual of English prose literature: biographical and critical, designed mainly to show characteristics of style|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DiYXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA5|year=1895|publisher=Ginn|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his ''Handbook to Literature'', Harmon offers an early example in American literature found in [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]’s "Snowflakes":&lt;ref name=harmon/&gt;

:Out of the bosom of the Air,
:Out of the cloud-folds of her garment shaken,
:Over the woodlands brown and bare, 
:Over the harvest-fields forsaken,
:Silent and soft, and slow,
:Descends the snow.

Starting with a succession of parallel adverbial phrases ("Out of the bosom," "Out of the cloud-folds," "Over the woodlands," "Over the harvest-fields"), each followed by parallel modification ("of the air," "of her garment shaken," "brown and bare," "forsaken"), the sentence is left grammatically incomplete until the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]/[[verb]] group "Descends the snow".&lt;ref name=harmon/&gt; Other American examples cited include the opening lines of [[William Cullen Bryant]]'s "[[A Forest Hymn]]" and lines 9-16 of his "[[Thanatopsis]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blount|first=Alma|title=Intensive studies in American literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcMpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA39|year=1914|publisher=Macmillan|pages=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly long example is the opening stanza (lines 1-22) of [[Walt Whitman]]'s "[[Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blount|first=Alma|title=Intensive studies in American literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcMpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA277|year=1914|publisher=Macmillan|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "now-famous periodic sentence" occurs in [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s short story "[[The Overcoat]]":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFarlin|first=Harold A.|year=1979|title='The Overcoat' As a Civil Service Episode|journal=[[Canadian-American Slavic Studies]]|volume=13|issue=3|pages=235–53|doi=10.1163/221023979X00096}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Even at those hours when the gray Petersburg sky is completely overcast and the whole population of clerks have dined and eaten their fill, each as best he can, according to the salary he receives and his personal tastes; when they are all resting after the scratching of pens and bustle of the office, their own necessary work and other people's, and all the tasks that an overzealous man voluntarily sets himself even beyond what is necessary; when the clerks are hastening to devote what is left of their time to pleasure; some more enterprising are flying to the theater, others to the street to spend their leisure staring at women's hats, some to spend the evening paying compliments to some attractive girl, the star of a little official circle, while some—and this is the most frequent of all—go simply to a fellow clerk's apartment on the third or fourth story, two little rooms with a hall or a kitchen, with some pretensions to style, with a lamp or some such article that has cost many sacrifices of dinners and excursions—at the time when all the clerks are scattered about the apartments of their friends, playing a stormy game of whist, sipping tea out of glasses, eating cheap biscuits, sucking in smoke from long pipes, telling, as the cards are dealt, some scandal that has floated down from higher circles, a pleasure which the Russian do never by any possibility deny himself, or, when there is nothing better to talk about, repeating the everlasting anecdote of the commanding officer who was told that the tail had been cut off the horse on the Falconet monument—in short, even when everyone, was eagerly seeking entertainment, Akaky Akakievich did not indulge in any amusement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Sarah Lawall|title=The Norton Anthology of Western Literature|edition=8|volume=2|year=2006|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-92616-3|pages=1008–33|chapter=Nikolai Gogol: "The Overcoat"|display-editors=etal}} Quote on pp. 1016-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10417">[[File:Amore e Psiche,Canova (1757-1822), Retro.JPG|thumb|right|Rear view of the [[Louvre]]'s prime version of [[Antonio Canova]]'s ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]'', 1793]]
In the [[art world]], if an artwork exists in several versions, the one known or believed to be the earliest is called the '''prime version'''.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (2001), 21&lt;/ref&gt;   Many artworks produced in media such as [[painting]] or carved [[sculpture]] which create unique objects are in fact repeated by their artists, often several times.  It is regarded as a matter of some importance both by [[art historian]]s and the art market to establish which version has "priority", that is to say was the original work.  The presumption usually is that the prime version is the finest, and perhaps the most carefully done, though some later versions can be argued to improve on the originals.  

In many periods the later "repetitions" were often produced by the workshop of the master, with varying degrees of supervision and direct attention from him.  This was especially the case with official portraits of monarchs and politicians, which in the Early Modern period were often ordered in large numbers of versions from the court artist as [[diplomatic gift]]s.  Sometimes "reduced versions" that are considerably smaller than the prime one are made. 

==Contexts==
[[File:Pope Julius II.jpg|thumb|left|The London version of ''[[Portrait of Pope Julius II (Raphael)|Portrait of Pope Julius II]]'' by [[Raphael]], 1511–12, recognized since 1970 as the prime version]]

In the case of official portraits the later creation of replica versions was likely to have been anticipated from the start, as in other types of art such as [[printmaking]], but in other types of painting, especially [[history painting]], the normal presumption, in the past as today, was that each work was a unique creation.  This was a matter of some importance to the owner, and there was evidently in some periods a general understanding that a work should not be replicated or copied without the permission of the owner of the prime version, which needed to be asked for carefully and was not always given.  In many periods "replicas were the direct product of collecting, as collectors have always preferred recognizable masterpieces to what is offbeat".&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (2001), 21&lt;/ref&gt;  

This was true of 17th century Rome, where artists such as [[Orazio Gentileschi]] and [[Bernardo Strozzi]] routinely made replicas, and others such as [[Guercino]] and [[Guido Reni]] sometimes did,&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (2001), 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; as of Victorian London, where artists such as [[William Powell Frith]] often painted one or more replica versions of their successes.  In Frith's case the replicas were painted many years after his first versions, when his newer work was achieving less success.  The French painter {{Interlanguage link multi|Charles Landelle|fr}} recorded no fewer than 32 versions of his ''Femme Fellah'', an [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] hit at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Pieces of sculpture made by [[casting]] processes that allow the original model to be reproduced several times are rather different; though the first in an edition (today often kept by the artist) has some added prestige, it is expected that a number of versions will be made.

[[File:Aeneas' Flight from Troy by Federico Barocci.jpg|thumb|''Aeneas' Flight from Troy by [[Federico Barocci]]'', image of the replica version in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/47.100.1023|title=Agostino Carracci after Federico Barocci: Aeneas and His Family Fleeing Troy (47.100.1023) - Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History - The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An example of a work now only known from a replica (in the [[Galleria Borghese]] in Rome) and studies is ''[[Aeneas]] and his Family Fleeing Troy'', the only secular [[history painting]] by [[Federico Barocci]]. The prime version was given in 1586 by [[Francesco Maria II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino|Francesco Maria II]], the last [[Duke of Urbino]], to [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in Prague, and was later looted by the Swedes. It was taken to Rome by Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], passed to the [[Orleans collection]] in Paris, and finally sold at auction in London for 14 guineas in 1800 (the price probably reflecting the poor condition some sources mention), since when its whereabouts are unknown.  The Rome version was painted in 1598, presumably for Cardinal [[Scipio Borghese]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Nicholas, ''Federico Barocci'', 2000, Vilo (109)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judging the prime version==
In some cases it is evident which version of a work is prime, especially if there is a full [[provenance]] including a contract or other documentation of the original commission; a contract for a copy will normally make that clear.  Otherwise experts will look both at the overall quality of the work, and also technical elements such as detailed [[underdrawing]] and [[pentimenti]] (changes of mind) that indicate that the artist was finalizing his idea of the work as he proceeded. [[Infrared]] and [[X-ray]] photography are among the scientific techniques that may help in discovering these technical issues.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1986), 436-438, and 432, provide examples of such discussions, relating to various paintings by Caravaggio&lt;/ref&gt;  Close comparison with the evolving style of other works by the artist and the comparison, ideally physically side by side, between two rival versions will often lead to a clear conclusion,&lt;ref&gt;Millar&lt;/ref&gt; but sometimes arguments between experts may take decades to reach a conclusion, as with other issues of attribution.  

One of the most dramatic reassessments in recent decades, of a very important work, came  in 1970 when a new assessment of a version of the ''[[Portrait of Pope Julius II (Raphael)|Portrait of Pope Julius II]]'' by [[Raphael]] drew on a combination of new scientific research and archival knowledge, as x-rays revealed an inventory number from 1693, as well as a background that Raphael had repainted.  The version in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]], previously considered prime, was replaced by the version in the [[National Gallery, London]], previously considered a replica.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkerton and Roy, 757-759, which reports further testing modifying the earlier conclusions of Gould, 208-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*[[Leonardo da Vinci]], ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]''; prime [[Louvre]], second version [[National Gallery, London]]
*[[Antonio Canova]], ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]''; prime Louvre (completed 1793), other versions [[Hermitage Museum]] (1796) and elsewhere. An example of a relatively recent work where documentary evidence means that the prime version has never been in dispute. 
*[[William Powell Frith]], ''[[The Derby Day]]''; prime (1858) [[Tate Britain]], second version (1893–94) [[Manchester City Art Gallery]], plus a much smaller but highly finished "original study", sold at [[Christie's]] for £505,250 in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16216133 Re-discovered William Powell Frith sells at auction], BBC News, 16 December 2011; [http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5521063 Sale of study], Christie's, lot details 15 December 2011, Frith ''Derby Day''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ary Scheffer]], ''[[Francesca da Rimini and Paolo Malatesta Appraised by Dante and Virgil]]'' (and variant titles).  Probably his best-known work; over 15 years after the original he produced several smaller versions.  The prime version, from 1835, measures {{convert|166.5|by|234|cm}}; now [[Wallace Collection]] in London. The second version (1854), measuring {{convert|51.7|by|81.3|cm}}, is in the [[Hamburger Kunsthalle]]. The third version (1855) is now in the [[Louvre]]. Another version from 1851 measuring {{convert|24.7|by|33.2|cm}} is in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1980.40 |publisher=Cleveland Museum of Art |accessdate=11 September 2015 |title=Dante and Virgil Meeting the Shades of Francesca da Rimini and Paolo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Carnegie Museum of Art]] in [[Pittsburgh]] has another version.&lt;ref&gt;[https://museumnetwork.sothebys.com/museum/carnegie-museum-of-art/exhibition/visions-of-order-and-chaos-the-enlightened-eye Ary Scheffer, ''Dante and Virgil Encountering the Shades of Francesca da Rimini and Paolo Malatesta in the Underworld'', (detail) 1851, oil on canvas, Heinz Family Fund and Anonymous gift, CMOA]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scientific literature''' comprises scholarly [[publication]]s that report original [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] and [[theoretical]] work in the [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s, and within an academic field, often abbreviated as '''the literature'''.  [[Academic publishing]] is the process of contributing the results of one's [[research]] into the literature, which often requires a peer-review process. Original [[scientific research]] published for the first time in [[scientific journal]]s is called the [[primary literature]]. Patents and [[technical report]]s, for minor research results and engineering and design work (including computer software), can also be considered primary literature. [[Secondary source]]s include review articles (which summarize the findings of published studies to highlight advances and new lines of research) and [[book]]s (for large projects or broad arguments, including compilations of articles). [[Tertiary source]]s might include [[encyclopedia]]s and similar works intended for broad public consumption.

== Types of scientific publications ==

Scientific literature can include the following kinds of publications:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Öchsner|first=Andreas|title=Types of Scientific Publications|date=2013|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38646-6_3|work=Introduction to Scientific Publishing|pages=9–21|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38646-6_3|isbn=9783642386459|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* scientific articles published in [[Scientific journal|scientific journals]]
* [[Patent|patents]] specialized for science and technology (for example, [[Biological patent|biological patents]] and [[Chemical patent|chemical patents]])
* [[Book|books]] wholly written by one or a small number of co-[[Author|authors]]
* [[Edited volume|edited volumes]], where each [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] is the responsibility of a different author or set of authors, while the [[Editing|editor]] is responsible for determining the scope of the project, keeping the work on schedule, and ensuring consistency of style and content
* presentations at [[Academic conference|academic conferences]], especially those organized by [[Learned society|learned societies]]
* [[government]] reports such as a [[forensic investigation]] conducted by a government agency such as the [[NTSB]]
* scientific publications on the [[World Wide Web]]
* books, [[Technical report|technical reports]], [[Pamphlet|pamphlets]], and [[Working paper|working papers]] issued by individual researchers or research organizations on their own initiative; these are sometimes organised into a series
* [[blogs]] and science forums

Literature may also be published in areas considered to be "[[Grey literature|grey]]", as they are published outside of traditional channels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This material is traditionally not indexed by major databases and can include manuals, theses and dissertations, or newsletters and bulletins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The significance of different types of the scientific publications can vary between disciplines and change over time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} According to James G. Speight and Russell Foote, peer-reviewed journals are the most prominent and prestigious form of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ORgP4AwPtQC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;lpg=PA241&amp;dq=peer-reviewed+journal+articles+remain+the+predominant+publication+type,+and+have+the+highest+prestige.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ssTqWvQvWE&amp;sig=nLzMKCNc2qRGt3auPXHrH7TXh54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjSwLGLpqLeAhXEzlMKHc9xDUcQ6AEwAXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=peer-reviewed%20journal%20articles%20remain%20the%20predominant%20publication%20type,%20and%20have%20the%20highest%20prestige.&amp;f=false|title=Ethics in Science and Engineering|last=Speight|first=James G.|last2=Foote|first2=Russell|date=2011-04-27|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9781118104842|location=|pages=241|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally books published by university presses are usually considered more prestigious than those published by commercial presses.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The status of working papers and [[conference proceeding]]s depends on the discipline; they are typically more important in the [[applied sciences]]. The value of publication as a [[preprint]] or scientific report on the web has in the past been low, but in some subjects, such as [[mathematics]] or [[high energy physics]], it is now an accepted alternative.{{citationneeded|date=October 2018}}

=== Scientific papers and articles ===
There are ten different types of scientific papers. Eight of these carry specific objectives, while the other two can vary depending on the style and the intended goal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peh|first=Wilfred|date=2008|title=Basic structure and types of scientific papers|url=|journal=Effective Medical Writing|volume=|pages=|via=Singapore Medical Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papers that carry specific objectives are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

* '''The original article''' provides new information from original research usually supported by statistics.
* '''case reports''' are unique events that researchers look at to gain information on what they are researching.
* '''technical notes''' this is a description of a technique or piece of equipment that has been modified from an existing one to be new and more effective.
* '''[[pictorial essay]]''' are a series of images high in quality that's goal is to teach what the pictures are of.
* '''[[Review article|review]]''' is a detailed analysis of recent developments on a topic.
* '''commentary''' is a short summery of an author's personal experience.
* '''[[Editorial|editorials]]''' are short reviews or critiques of original articles.
* '''letters to the editor''', these are comments directed to the editor of an article to ask questions and provide constructive criticism.

These two have varying types of scientific classifications and can range from historical articles to speeches:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''other.''' Other types of papers not listed under non scientific material or any of the 8 above types of scientific publications are put into this category and vary depending on the objective and style of the article.
* '''nonscientific material.''' This type of material comes from the result of an article being published. it does not advance an article scientifically but instead contributes to its reputation as a scientific article.

===Preparation===
The actual day-to-day records of scientific information are kept in research notebooks or logbooks. These are usually kept indefinitely as the basic evidence of the work, and are often kept in duplicate, signed, notarized, and archived. The purpose is to preserve the evidence for scientific priority, and in particular for priority for obtaining patents. They have also been used in scientific disputes.  Since the availability of computers, the notebooks in some data-intensive fields have been kept as database records, and appropriate software is commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

The work on a project is typically published as one or more technical reports, or articles. In some fields both are used, with preliminary reports, working papers, or [[preprint]]s followed by a formal article. Articles are usually prepared at the end of a project, or at the end of components of a particularly large one. In preparing such an article vigorous rules for [[scientific writing]] have to be followed.

===Language===
{{see also|Impact factor|Copy editing}} 

Often, career advancement depends upon publishing in high-impact journals, which, especially in hard and applied sciences, are usually published in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | title=MEDLINE Fact Sheet | publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] | location=Washington DC | accessdate=October 15, 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016122141/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | archivedate=October 16, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, scientists with poor English writing skills are at a disadvantage when trying to publish in these journals, regardless of the quality of the scientific study itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pan, Z|title=Crossing the language limitations|journal=PLOS Medicine |volume=3|pages=E410|year=2006|pmid=17002510|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030410|last2=Gao|first2=J|issue=9|pmc=1576334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet many{{which|date=August 2018}} international universities require publication in these high-impact journals by both their students and faculty. One way that some international authors are beginning to overcome this problem is by contracting with freelance medical copy editors who are native speakers of English and specialize in ESL (English as a second language) editing to polish their manuscripts' English to a level that high-impact journals will accept.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===Structure and style===
{{main|IMRAD}}
A scientific article has a standardized structure, which varies only slightly in different subjects. Although the IMRAD structure emphasizes the organization of content and in scientific journal articles, each section (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) has unique conventions for scientific writing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.routledge.com/Scientific-And-Medical-Communication-A-Guide-For-Effective-Practice/Mogull/p/book/9781138842557|title=Scientific And Medical Communication: A Guide For Effective Practice|last=Mogull|first=Scott A.|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781138842557|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, it is not the format that is important, but what lies behind it--the content. However, several key formatting requirements need to be met:

#The title attracts readers' attention and informs them about the contents of the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langdon-Neuner|first=Elise|title=Titles in medical articles: What do we know about them?|journal=The Write Stuff|year=2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=158–160|url=http://www.emwa.org/members/indevelopment/neuner.pd|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Titles are distinguished into three main types: declarative titles (state the main conclusion), descriptive titles (describe a paper's content), and interrogative titles (challenge readers with a question that is answered in the text).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vasilev|first=Martin|title=How to write a good title for journal articles|url=http://jeps.efpsa.org/blog/2012/09/01/how-to-write-a-good-title-for-journal-articles/|work=JEPS Bulletin|publisher=European Federation of Psychology Students’ Associations|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some journals indicate, in their instructions to authors, the type (and length) of permitted titles.
#The names and affiliations of all authors are given. In the wake of some [[scientific misconduct]] cases, publishers often require that all co-authors know and agree on the content of the article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scientific fraud#Responsibility of authors and of coauthors]]&lt;/ref&gt;
#An [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] summarizes the work (in a single paragraph or in several short paragraphs) and is intended to represent the article in bibliographic databases and to furnish [[subject metadata]] for indexing services.
# The context of previous scientific investigations should be presented, by citation relevant documents in the existing literature, usually in a section called an "Introduction".
# Empirical techniques, laid out in a section usually called "Materials and Methods", should be described in such a way that a subsequent scientist, with appropriate knowledge of and experience in the relevant field, should be able to repeat the observations and know whether he or she has obtained the same result. This naturally varies between subjects, and does not apply to mathematics and related subjects.
#Similarly, the results of the investigation, in a section usually called "Results", data should be presented in tabular or graphic form ([[image]], [[chart]], [[schematic]], [[diagram]] or [[drawing]]). These display elements should be accompanied by a caption and discussed in the text of the article.
# Interpretation of the meaning of the results is usually addressed in a "Discussion" or "Conclusions" section. The conclusions drawn should be based on the new empirical results while taking established knowledge into consideration, in such a way that any reader with knowledge of the field can follow the argument and confirm that the conclusions are sound.  That is, acceptance of the conclusions must not depend on personal [[appeal to authority|authority]], [[rhetoric|rhetorical skill]], or [[faith]].
# Finally, a "References" or "Literature Cited" section lists the sources cited by the authors.

== Peer review ==
{{main|Scholarly peer review}}
Though peer review and the learned journal format are not themselves an essential part of scientific literature, they are both convenient ways of ensuring that the above fundamental criteria are met. They are essentially a means of [[quality control]], a term which also encompasses other means towards the same goal.

The "quality" being referred to here is the scientific one, which consists of transparency and repeatability of the research for independent verification, the validity of the conclusions and interpretations drawn from the reported data, overall importance for advance within a given field of knowledge, novelty, and in certain fields applicability as well. The lack of peer review is what makes most [[technical report]]s and World Wide Web publications unacceptable as contributions to the literature. The relatively weak peer review often applied to books and chapters in edited books means that their status is also second-tier, unless an author's personal standing is so high that prior achievement and a continued stake in one's reputation within the scientific community signals a clear expectation of quality.

The emergence of institutional digital repositories where scholars can post their work as it is submitted to a print-based journal has taken formal peer review into a state of flux. Though publicizing a preprint online does not prevent it from being peer reviewed, it does allow an unreviewed copy to be widely circulated. On the positive side this change has led to faster dissemination of novel work within the scientific community; on the negative it has made it more difficult to discern a valid scientific contribution from the unmeritorious.

Increasing reliance on [[Indexing and abstracting service|abstracting service]]s, especially on those available electronically, means that the effective criterion for whether a publication format forms part of the established, trusted literature is whether it is covered by these services; in particular, by the specialised service for the discipline concerned such as [[Chemical Abstracts Service]], and by the major interdisciplinary services such as those marketed by the [[Institute for Scientific Information]].

==Ethics==
The transfer of [[copyright]] from author to publisher, used by some journals, can be controversial because many authors want to propagate their ideas more widely and re-use their material elsewhere without the need for permission. Usually an author or authors circumvent that problem by rewriting an article and using other pictures. Some publishers may also want publicity for their journal so will approve [[facsimile]] [[reproduction]] unconditionally; other publishers are more resistant. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In terms of research publications, a number of key issues include and are not restricted to:&lt;ref name="Chanson2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson]] |title=Digital Publishing, Ethics and Hydraulic Engineering: The Elusive or "Boring" Bore?  |url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159099 |publisher=In: Stefano Pagliara 2nd International Junior Researcher and Engineer Workshop on Hydraulic Structures (IJREW'08), Pisa, Italy, Keynote, pp. 3-13, 30 July-1 August 2008 |year=2008 |isbn=978-88-8492-568-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Honesty. Honesty and integrity is a duty of each author and person, expert-reviewer and member of journal editorial boards.
* Review process.

**Authors Disputes. The authorship of an article is simply the author of the article. The ethical issue with this is when there are two people that believe to be the author, but there is only one true author. There are guidelines to help pick which get authorship of the writing.

[[Ray Solomonoff]]'s theory of universal '''inductive inference''' is a theory of prediction based on logical observations, such as predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. The only assumption that the theory makes is that the environment follows some unknown but [[Computable function|computable]] [[probability distribution]]. It is a mathematical formalization of [[Occam's razor]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;JJ McCall. Induction: From Kolmogorov and Solomonoff to De Finetti and Back to Kolmogorov – Metroeconomica, 2004 – Wiley Online Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;D Stork.

On the existence and convergence of computable universal priors [https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0305052 arxiv.org] – Algorithmic Learning Theory, 2003 – Springer&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Principle of Multiple Explanations]].&lt;ref name="Paul Vitanyi p 339"&gt;Ming Li and Paul Vitanyi, ''An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications.''  Springer-Verlag, N.Y., 2008p 339 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prediction is done using a completely [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] framework. The [[universal prior]] is calculated for all computable sequences—this is the universal a priori probability distribution;
no computable hypothesis will have a [[zero probability]]. This means that Bayes rule of causation can be used in predicting the continuation of any particular computable sequence.

==Origin==

===Philosophical===
The theory is based in philosophical foundations, and was founded by [[Ray Solomonoff]] around 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Rathmanner and [[Marcus Hutter]]. A philosophical treatise of universal induction. Entropy, 13(6):1076–1136, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is a mathematically formalized combination of [[Occam's razor]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hernandez.1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutter.2003"/&gt; and the [[Principle of Multiple Explanations]].&lt;ref name="Paul Vitanyi p 339"/&gt;
All [[computable]] theories which perfectly describe previous observations are used to calculate the probability of the next observation, with more weight put on the shorter computable theories. Marcus Hutter's [[universal artificial intelligence]] builds upon this to calculate the [[expected value]] of an action.

===Mathematical===
The proof of the "razor" is based on the known mathematical properties of a probability distribution over a [[Countable set|countable]] set. These properties are relevant because the infinite set of all programs is a denumerable set. The sum S of the probabilities of all programs must be exactly equal to one (as per the definition of [[probability]]) thus the probabilities must roughly decrease as we enumerate the infinite set of all programs, otherwise S will be strictly greater than one.  To be more precise, for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 0, there is some length ''l'' such that the probability of all programs longer than ''l'' is at most &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  This does not, however, preclude very long programs from having very high probability.

Fundamental ingredients of the theory are the concepts of [[algorithmic probability]]  and [[Kolmogorov complexity]]. The universal [[prior probability]] of any prefix ''p'' of a computable sequence ''x'' is the sum of the probabilities of all programs (for a [[universal computer]]) that compute something starting with ''p''. Given some ''p'' and any computable but unknown probability distribution from which ''x'' is sampled, the universal prior and [[Bayes' theorem]] can be used to predict the yet unseen parts of ''x'' in optimal fashion.

==Modern applications==

===Artificial intelligence===
Though Solomonoff's inductive inference is not [[computable]], several [[AIXI]]-derived algorithms approximate it in order to make it run on a modern computer. The more computing power they are given, the closer their predictions are to the predictions of inductive inference (their mathematical [[limit (math)|limit]] is Solomonoff's inductive inference).&lt;ref&gt;J. Veness, K.S. Ng, M. Hutter, W. Uther, D. Silver. "A Monte Carlo AIXI Approximation" – [https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0801 Arxiv preprint], 2009 arxiv.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Veness, K.S. Ng, M. Hutter, D. Silver. "Reinforcement Learning via AIXI Approximation" [https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2049 Arxiv preprint], 2010 – aaai.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Pankov. A computational approximation to the AIXI model from agiri.org – Artificial general intelligence, 2008: proceedings of …, 2008 – books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Another direction of inductive inference is based on [[E. Mark Gold]]'s model of [[Language identification in the limit|learning in the limit]] from 1967 and has developed since then more and more models of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gold | first1 = E. Mark | year = 1967 | title = Language identification in the limit | journal = Information and Control | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 447–474 | publisher =  | jstor =  | doi = 10.1016/S0019-9958(67)91165-5 | url=http://web.mit.edu/~6.863/www/spring2009/readings/gold67limit.pdf | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general scenario is the following: Given a class ''S'' of computable functions, is there a learner (that is, recursive functional) which for any input of the form (''f''(0),''f''(1),...,''f''(''n'')) outputs a hypothesis (an index ''e'' with respect to a previously agreed on acceptable numbering of all computable functions; the indexed function may be required consistent with the given values of ''f''). A learner ''M'' learns a function ''f'' if almost all its hypotheses are the same index ''e'', which generates the function ''f''; ''M'' learns ''S'' if ''M'' learns every ''f'' in ''S''. Basic results are that all recursively enumerable classes of functions are learnable while the class REC of all computable functions is not learnable. 
{{citation needed|reason=The previously cited paper (Gold 1967) is only about learning of a language, i.e. (a description of) a set of strings, from a sequence of member strings. Another reference is needed for the more general scenario about learning functions from sample values, in particular about the basic results.|date=January 2014}}
Many related models have been considered and also the learning of classes of recursively enumerable sets from positive data is a topic studied from Gold's pioneering paper in 1967 onwards. A far reaching extension of the Gold’s approach is developed by Schmidhuber's theory of generalized Kolmogorov complexities,&lt;ref name=GenKolm&gt;{{cite journal| author=J. Schmidhuber | title=Hierarchies of generalized Kolmogorov complexities and nonenumerable universal measures computable in the limit | journal=International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science | volume=13 | issue=4 | pages=587–612 | year=2002 | url=ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/ijfcspreprint.pdf| doi=10.1142/S0129054102001291}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are kinds of [[super-recursive algorithm]]s.

===Turing machines===

{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}

The third mathematically based direction of inductive inference makes use of the theory of automata and computation. In this context, the process of inductive inference is performed by an abstract automaton called an inductive [[Turing machine]] (Burgin, 2005).
''Inductive Turing machines'' represent the next step in the development of computer science providing better models for contemporary computers and computer networks (Burgin, 2001) and forming an important class of super-recursive algorithms as they satisfy all conditions in the definition of [[algorithm]]. Namely, each inductive Turing machines is a type of effective method in which a definite list of well-defined instructions for completing a task, when given an initial state, will proceed through a well-defined series of successive states, eventually terminating in an end-state. The difference between an inductive Turing machine and a [[Turing machine]] is that to produce the result a Turing machine has to stop, while in some cases an inductive Turing machine can do this without stopping. [[Stephen Kleene]] called procedures that could run forever without stopping by the name ''calculation procedure or algorithm'' (Kleene 1952:137). Kleene also demanded that such an algorithm must eventually exhibit "some object" (Kleene 1952:137). This condition is satisfied by inductive Turing machines, as their results are exhibited after a finite number of steps, but inductive Turing machines do not always tell at which step the result has been obtained.

Simple inductive Turing machines are equivalent to other models of computation. More advanced inductive Turing machines are much more powerful. It is proved (Burgin, 2005) that limiting partial recursive functions, trial and error predicates, general Turing machines, and simple inductive Turing machines are equivalent models of computation. However, simple inductive Turing machines and general Turing machines give direct constructions of computing automata, which are thoroughly grounded in physical machines. In contrast, trial and error predicates, limiting recursive functions and limiting partial recursive functions present syntactic systems of symbols with formal rules for their manipulation. Simple inductive Turing machines and general Turing machines are related to limiting partial recursive functions and trial and error predicates as Turing machines are related to partial recursive functions and lambda-calculus.

Note that only simple inductive Turing machines have the same structure (but different functioning semantics of the output mode) as Turing machines. Other types of inductive Turing machines have an essentially more advanced structure due to the structured memory and more powerful instructions. Their utilization for inference and learning allows achieving higher efficiency and better reflects learning of people (Burgin and Klinger, 2004).

Some researchers confuse computations of inductive Turing machines with non-stopping computations or with infinite time computations. First, some of computations of inductive Turing machines halt. As in the case of conventional Turing machines, some halting computations give the result, while others do not give. Second, some non-stopping computations of inductive Turing machines give results, while others do not give. Rules of inductive Turing machines determine when a computation (stopping or non-stopping) gives a result. Namely, an inductive Turing machine produces output from time to time and once this output stops changing, it is considered the result of the computation. It is necessary to know that descriptions of this rule in some papers are incorrect. For instance, Davis (2006: 128) formulates the rule when result is obtained without stopping as "… once the correct output has been produced any subsequent output will simply repeat this correct result." Third, in contrast to the widespread misconception, inductive Turing machines give results (when it happens) always after a finite number of steps (in finite time) in contrast to infinite and infinite-time computations.
There are two main distinctions between conventional Turing machines and simple inductive Turing machines. The first distinction is that even simple inductive Turing machines can do much more than conventional Turing machines. The second distinction is that a conventional Turing machine always informs (by halting or by coming to a final state) when the result is obtained, while a simple inductive Turing machine in some cases does inform about reaching the result, while in other cases (where the conventional Turing machine is helpless), it does not inform. People have an illusion that a computer always itself informs (by halting or by other means) when the result is obtained. In contrast to this, users themselves have to decide in many cases whether the computed result is what they need or it is necessary to continue computations. Indeed, everyday desktop computer applications like word processors and spreadsheets spend most of their time waiting in [[event loop]]s, and do not terminate until directed to do so by users.

====Evolutionary inductive Turing machines====
Evolutionary approach to inductive inference is accomplished by another class of automata called evolutionary inductive Turing machines (Burgin and Eberbach, 2009; 2012). An ‘’’evolutionary inductive Turing machine’’’ is a (possibly infinite) sequence ''E'' = {''A''[''t'']; ''t'' = 1, 2, 3, ... } of inductive Turing machines ''A''[''t''] each working on generations X[t] which are coded as words in the alphabet of the machines ''A''[''t'']. The goal is to build a “population” ''Z'' satisfying the inference condition. The automaton ''A''[''t''] called a component, or a level automaton, of E represents (encodes) a one-level evolutionary algorithm that works with input generations ''X''[''i''] of the population by applying the variation operators v and selection operator s. The first generation ''X''[0] is given as input to ''E'' and is processed by the automaton ''A''[1], which generates/produces the first generation ''X''[1] as its transfer output, which goes to the automaton ''A''[2]. For all ''t'' =&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;..., the automaton ''A''[''t''] receives the generation ''X''[''t''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1] as its input from ''A''[''t''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1] and then applies the variation operator v and selection operator ''s'', producing the generation ''X''[''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1] and sending it to ''A''[''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1] to continue evolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27316">The environmental '''[[sustainability]]''' problem has proven difficult to solve. The modern [[environmental movement]] has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways. But little progress has been made, as shown by severe [[ecological footprint]] overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the [[climate change]] problem. Something within the human system is preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior. That system trait is '''systemic change resistance'''. Change resistance is also known as organizational resistance, barriers to change, or policy resistance.&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, "Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, 2000, pp 5-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of resistance to solving the sustainability problem==

While environmentalism had long been a minor force in political change, the movement strengthened significantly in the 1970s with the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970, in which over 20 million people participated, with publication of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in 1972, and with the first [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in Stockholm in 1972. Early expectations the problem could be solved ran high. 114 out of 132 members of the United Nations attended the Stockholm conference. The conference was widely seen at the time as a harbinger of success:&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Encyclopedia, Second Edition, W. P. Cunningham et al., editors, 1998, page 1054.&lt;/ref&gt;

: "Many believe the most important result of the conference was the precedent it set for international cooperation in addressing environmental degradation. The nations attending agreed they shared responsibility for the quality of the environment, particularly the oceans and the atmosphere, and they signed a declaration of principles, after extensive negotiations, concerning their obligations. The conference also approved an environmental fund and an ‘action program,’ which involved 200 specific recommendations for addressing such problems as global climate change, [[marine pollution]], population growth, the dumping of toxic wastes, and the preservation of biodiversity. A permanent environment unit was established for coordinating these and other international efforts. [This later became] the United Nations Environmental Program [which was] was formally approved by the General Assembly later that same year and its base established in Nairobi, Kenya. This organization not only coordinated action but monitored research, collecting and disseminating information, and it has played an ongoing role in international negotiations about environmental issues.

:"The conference in Stockholm accomplished almost everything the preparatory committed had planned. It was widely considered successful, and many observers were almost euphoric about the extent of agreement."

However, despite the work of a worldwide [[environmental movement]], many national environmental protection agencies, creation of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]], and many international environmental treaties, the sustainability problem continues to grow worse. The latest [[ecological footprint]] data shows the world’s footprint increased from about 50% ''undershoot'' in 1961 to 50% ''overshoot'' in 2007, the last year data is available.&lt;ref&gt;John Talbert et al., The Genuine Progress Indicator 2006, A Tool for Sustainable Development, Redefining Progress, The Nature of Economics, 2006, available at [http://www.rprogress.org/publications/2007/GPI%202006.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 the first edition of ''The Limits to Growth'' analyzed the environmental sustainability problem using a [[system dynamics]] model. The widely influential book predicted that:&lt;ref&gt;"The Limits to Growth", Meadows et al., 1972, p23.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"If the present trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years. The most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity some time in the 21st century."

Yet thirty-two years later in 2004 the third edition reported that:&lt;ref&gt;"Limits to Growth", Meadows et al., 2004, p xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"[The second edition of Limits to Growth] was published in 1992, the year of the global summit on environment and development in Rio de Janeiro. The advent of the summit seemed to prove that global society had decided to deal seriously with the important environmental problems. But we now know that humanity failed to achieve the goals of Rio. The Rio plus 10 conference in Johannesburg in 2002 produced even less; it was almost paralyzed by a variety of ideological and economic disputes, [due to] the efforts of those pursuing their narrow national, corporate, or individual self-interests.

:"...humanity has largely squandered the past 30 years."

Change resistance runs so high that the world’s top two greenhouse gas emitters, [[China]] and the [[United States]], have never adopted the [[Kyoto Protocol]] treaty. In the US resistance was so strong that in 1999 the US Senate voted 95 to zero against the treaty by passing the [[Byrd–Hagel Resolution]], despite the fact [[Al Gore]] was vice-president at the time. Not a single senator could be persuaded to support the treaty, which has not been brought back to the floor since.

Due to prolonged change resistance, the climate change problem has escalated to the climate change crisis. [[Greenhouse gas]] emissions are rising much faster than [[IPCC]] models expected: “The growth rate of [fossil fuel] emissions was 3.5% per year for 2000-2007, an almost four fold increase from 0.9% per year in 1990-1999. … This makes current trends in emissions higher than the worst case IPCC-SRES scenario.” &lt;ref&gt;"Emissions rising faster this decade than last", CISIRO Media Release, September 25, 2008, available at [http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/Press%20Release_CSIRO_Australia_final.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Copenhagen Climate Summit]] of December 2009 ended in failure.&lt;ref name="Hartwell"&gt;"The Hartwell Paper", Prins, Gwrn et al., May 2010, available at [http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27939/1/HartwellPaper_English_version.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; No agreement on binding targets was reached. The [[Cancun climate summit|Cancun Climate Summit]] in December 2010 did not break the deadlock. The best it could do was another non-binding agreement:&lt;ref&gt;Outcome of the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention, 2010, available at [http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_16/application/pdf/cop16_lca.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:“Recognizing that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet, and thus requires to be urgently addressed by all Parties.”

This indicates no progress at all since 1992, when the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] was created at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The 2010 Cancun agreement was the functional equivalent of what the 1992 agreement said:&lt;ref&gt;''United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change'', United Nations, 1992, p2-4, available at [http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/conveng.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The Parties to this Convention... [acknowledge] that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response.... [thus the parties recognize] that States should enact effective environmental legislation... [to] protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind...."

Negotiations have bogged down so pervasively that: “Climate policy is gridlocked, and there’s virtually no chance of a breakthrough.” &lt;ref&gt;“Disaster at the Top of the World”, Thomas Homer-Dixon, New York Times, August 22, 2010, available at [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/opinion/23homer-dixon.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all].&lt;/ref&gt; “Climate policy, as it has been understood and practised by many governments of the world under the Kyoto Protocol approach, has failed to produce any discernible real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years.” &lt;ref name="Hartwell" /&gt;

These events suggest that change resistance to solving the sustainability problem is so high the problem is currently unsolvable.

==The change resistance and proper coupling subproblems==

Understanding change resistance requires seeing it as a distinct and separate part of the sustainability problem. Tanya Markvart’s 2009 thesis on ''Understanding Institutional Change and Resistance to Change Towards Sustainability'' stated that:&lt;ref name="Markvart"&gt;Tanya I. Markvart, ''Understanding Institutional Change and Resistance to Change Towards Sustainability: An Interdisciplinary Theoretical Framework and Illustrative Application to Provincial-Municipal Aggregates Policy'', 2009, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, pages 4, iii, and 157. Available at [http://www.environment.uwaterloo.ca/research/biosphere/Documents/Markvart_Tanya_000.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:"It has also been demonstrated that ecologically destructive and inequitable institutional systems can be highly resilient and resistant to change, even in the face of social-ecological degradation and/or collapse (e.g., Berkes &amp; Folke, 2002; Allison &amp; Hobbs, 2004; Brown, 2005; Runnalls, 2008; Finley, 2009; Walker et al., 2009)."

The thesis focuses specifically on developing “an interdisciplinary theoretical framework for understanding institutional change and resistance to change towards sustainability.”

Jack Harich's 2010 paper on ''Change Resistance as the Crux of the Environmental Sustainability Problem'' argues there are two separate problems to solve.&lt;ref name="Harich"&gt;Jack Harich, [http://www.thwink.org/sustain/articles/009/ChangeResistanceAsCrux.htm “Change Resistance as the Crux of the Environmental Sustainability Problem”], ''System Dynamics Review'', January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[root cause analysis]] and a [[system dynamics]] model were used to explain how:

:"...difficult social problems [like sustainability must be decomposed] into two sequential subproblems: (1) ''How to overcome change resistance'' and then (2) ''How to achieve proper coupling''. This is the timeless strategy of divide and conquer. By cleaving one big problem into two, the problem becomes an order of magnitude easier to solve, because we can approach the two subproblems differently and much more appropriately. We are no longer unknowingly attempting to solve two very different problems simultaneously."

The paper discussed the two subproblems:

: "''Change resistance'' is the tendency for a system to continue its current behavior, despite the application of force to change that behavior.

: "''Proper coupling'' occurs when the behavior of one system affects the behavior of other systems in a desirable manner, using the appropriate [[feedback loops]], so the systems work together in harmony in accordance with design objectives. … In the environmental sustainability problem the human system has become improperly coupled to the greater system it lives within: the environment.

:"Change resistance versus proper coupling allows a crucial distinction. Society is aware of the proper practices required to live sustainably and the need to do so. But society has a strong aversion to adopting these practices. As a result, problem solvers have created thousands of effective (and often ingenious) proper practices. But they are stymied in their attempts to have them taken up by enough of the system to solve the problem because an 'implicit system goal' is causing insurmountable change resistance. ''Therefore systemic change resistance is the crux of the problem and must be solved first.''"
 
The proper coupling subproblem is what most people consider as “the” problem to solve. It is called [[Decoupling (organizational studies)|decoupling]] in economic and environmental fields, where the term refers to economic growth without additional environmental degradation. Solving the proper coupling problem is the goal of environmentalism and in particular [[ecological economics]]: “Ecological economics is the study of the interactions and co-evolution in time and space of human economies and the ecosystems in which human economies are embedded.” &lt;ref&gt;The New Pelgrave Dictionary of Economics Online, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000221&amp;edition=current&amp;q=ecological%20economics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1/ abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;

Change resistance is also called barriers to change. Hoffman and Bazerman, in a chapter on “Understanding and overcoming the organizational and psychological barriers to action,” concluded that:&lt;ref&gt;"Organizations and the Sustainability Mosaic: Crafting Long-Term Ecological and Societal Solutions", Sharma, S. et al., (Ed), 2007. Chapter 4, Hoffman, A. J., and Bazerman, M. H., "Changing practice on sustainability: Understanding and overcoming the organizational and psychological barriers to action," p85.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In this chapter, we argue that the change in thinking required of the sustainability agenda will never come to fruition within practical domains unless proper attention is given to the sources of individual and social resistance to such change. The implementation of wise management practices cannot be accomplished without a concurrent set of strategies for surmounting these barriers."

[[John Sterman]], current leader of the system dynamics school of thought, came to the same conclusion:&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, 2008. "Risk Communication on Climate Change: Mental Models and Mass Balance." ''Science'', October 2008, vol. 322, no. 5901, pp 532-533.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The civil rights movement provides a better analogy for the climate challenge. Then, as now, entrenched special interests vigorously opposed change. … Of course, we need more research and technical innovation—money and genius are always in short supply. But there is no purely technical solution for climate change. For public policy to be grounded in the hard-won results of climate science, we must now turn our attention to the dynamics of social and political change."

These findings indicate there are at least two subproblems to be solved: change resistance and proper coupling. Given the human system’s long history of unsuccessful attempts to self-correct to a sustainable mode, it appears that high change resistance is preventing proper coupling. This may be expressed as an emerging principle: systemic change resistance is the crux of the sustainability problem and must be solved first, before the human system can be properly coupled to the greater system it lives within, the environment.

==Systemic versus individual change resistance==

Systemic change resistance differs significantly from individual change resistance. “Systemic means originating from the system in such a manner as to affect the behavior of most or all social agents of certain types, as opposed to originating from individual agents.” &lt;ref name="Harich" /&gt; Individual change resistance originates from individual people and organizations. How the two differ may be seen in this passage:&lt;ref&gt;Dent, Eric and Goldberg, Susan. 1999. ''Challenging Resistance to Change'', The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, Vol. 35, No. 1, 25-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The notion of resistance to change is credited to Kurt Lewin. His conceptualization of the phrase, however, is very different from today’s usage. [which treats resistance to change as a psychological concept, where resistance or support of change comes from values, habits, mental models, and so on residing within the individual] For Lewin, resistance to change could occur, but that resistance could be anywhere in the system. As Kotter (1995) found, ''it is possible for the resistance to be sited within the individual, but it is much more likely to be found elsewhere in the system. ''

:"Systems of social roles, with their associated patterns of attitudes, expectations, and behavior norms, share with biological systems the characteristic of homeostasis—i.e., tendencies to resist change, to restore the previous state after a disturbance.

:"Lewin had been working on this idea, that the status quo represented an equilibrium between the barriers to change and the forces favoring change, since 1928 as part of his field theory. He believed that some difference in these forces—weakening of the barriers or strengthening of the driving forces—was required to produce the unfreezing that began a change."

If sources of systemic change resistance are present, they are the principal cause of individual change resistance. According to the [[fundamental attribution error]] it is crucial to address systemic change resistance when present and avoid assuming that change resistance can be overcome by bargaining, reasoning, inspirational appeals, and so on. This is because:&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, "Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, 2000, p28.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"A fundamental principle of system dynamics states that the structure of the system gives rise to its behavior. However, people have a strong tendency to attribute the behavior of others to dispositional rather than situational factors, that is, to character and especially character flaws rather than the system in which these people are acting. The tendency to blame the person rather than the system is so strong psychologists call it the 'fundamental attribution error.' "

[[Peter Senge]], a thought leader of [[systems thinking]] for the business world, describes the structural source of systemic change resistance as being due to an “implicit system goal:” &lt;ref&gt;Peter Senge, ''The Fifth Discipline'', 1990, p88.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In general, balancing loops are more difficult to see than reinforcing loops because it often looks like nothing is happening. There’s no dramatic growth of sales and marketing expenditures, or nuclear arms, or lily pads. Instead, the balancing process maintains the status quo, even when all participants want change. The feeling, as Lewis Carroll’s Queen of Hearts put it, of needing ‘all the running you can do to keep in the same place’ is a clue that a balancing loop may exist nearby.

:"Leaders who attempt organizational change often find themselves unwittingly caught in balancing processes. To the leaders, it looks as though their efforts are clashing with sudden resistance that seems to come from nowhere. In fact, as my friend found when he tried to reduce burnout, the resistance is a response by the system, trying to maintain an ''implicit system goal''. Until this goal is recognized, the change effort is ''doomed to failure.''"

Senge’s insight applies to the sustainability problem. Until the “implicit system goal” causing systemic change resistance is found and resolved, change efforts to solve the proper coupling part of the sustainability problem may be, as Senge argues, “doomed to failure.”

==The current focus is on proper coupling==

Presently environmentalism is focused on solving the proper coupling subproblem. For example, the following are all proper coupling solutions. They attempt to solve the direct cause of the sustainability problem’s symptoms:
* The [[Kyoto Protocol]]
* The [[Waste hierarchy|Three Rs]] of reduce, reuse, recycle
* More use of [[renewable energy]]
* Better [[pollution control]] of many kinds
* Collective management of [[common-pool resources]]
* Certification programs to reduce deforestation such as [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification|PEFC]] and [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]]
* [[Contour farming]] to reduce soil erosion
* The [[green revolution]]
* [[Zero population growth]]

The direct cause of environmental impact is the three factors on the right side of the [[I PAT|I=PAT equation]] where '''I'''mpact equals '''P'''opulation times '''A'''ffluence (consumption per person) times '''T'''echnology (environmental impact per unit of consumption). It is these three factors that solutions like those listed above seek to reduce.

The top environmental organization in the world, the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP), focuses exclusively on proper coupling solutions:&lt;ref&gt;UNEP 2010 Annual Report, p8, Available at [http://www.unep.org/annualreport/2010/pdfs/UNEP-AR-2010-FULL-REPORT.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:"2010 marked the beginning of a period of new, strategic and transformational direction for UNEP as it began implementing its Medium Term Strategy (MTS) for 2010-2013 across six areas: Climate change; Disasters and conflicts; Ecosystem management; Environmental governance; Harmful substances and hazardous waste; Resource efficiency, Sustainable consumption and production."

The six areas are all direct practices to reduce the three factors of the I=PAT equation.
 
[[Al Gore]]s' 2006 documentary film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' described the climate change problem and the urgency of solving it. The film concluded with Gore saying:

:"Each one of us is a cause of global warming, but each one of us can make choices to change that with the things we buy, the electricity we use, the cars we drive; we can make choices to bring our individual carbon emissions to zero. The solutions are in our hands, ''we just have to have the determination to make it happen. We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions, everything but political will. '' But in America, the will to act is a renewable resource."

The four solutions Gore mentions are proper coupling practices. There is, however, a hint of acknowledgement that overcoming systemic change resistance is the real challenge, when Gore says “...we just have to have the determination to make it happen. We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions, everything but political will.”

The twenty-seven solutions that appear during the film’s closing credits are mostly proper coupling solutions. The first nine are:&lt;ref&gt;''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'': Closing Credits, available at [http://www.folklib.net/index/wi/ait_closing_credits.shtml].&lt;/ref&gt;

* Go to [http://www.climatecrisis.net www.climatecrisis.net]
* You can reduce your carbon emissions. In fact, you can even reduce your carbon emissions to zero.
* Buy energy efficient appliances &amp; light bulbs.
* Change your thermostat (and use clock thermostats) to reduce energy for heating &amp; cooling.
* Weatherize your house, increase insulation, get an energy audit.
* Recycle.
* If you can, buy a hybrid car.
* When you can, walk or ride a bicycle.
* Where you can, use light rail &amp; mass transit.

Some solutions are attempts to overcome individual change resistance, such as:

* Tell your parents not to ruin the world that you will live in.
* If you are a parent, join with your children to save the world they will live in.
* Vote for leaders who pledge to solve this crisis.
* Write to congress. If they don’t listen, run for congress.
* Speak up in your community.

However none of the twenty-seven solutions deal with overcoming systemic change resistance.

==Overcoming systemic change resistance==

Efforts here are sparse because environmentalism is currently not oriented toward treating systemic change resistance as a distinct and separate problem to solve.

On how to specifically overcome the change resistance subproblem, Markvart examined two leading theories that seemed to offer insight into change resistance, [[Panarchy]] theory and [[New institutionalism|New Institutionalism]], and concluded that:&lt;ref name="Markvart" /&gt;

:"...neither theory devotes significant attention to understanding the dynamics of resilient and resistant but inefficient and/or unproductive institutional and ecological systems. Overall, more research is required...."

Taking a [[root cause analysis]] and [[system dynamics]] modeling approach, Harich carefully defined the three characteristics of a [[root cause]] and then found a main systemic root cause for both the change resistance and proper coupling subproblems.&lt;ref name="Harich" /&gt; Several sample solution elements for resolving the root causes were suggested. The point was made that the exact solution policies chosen do not matter nearly as much as finding the correct systemic root causes. Once these are found, how to resolve them is relatively obvious because once a root cause is found by structural modeling, the high leverage point for resolving it follows easily. Solutions may then push on specific structural points in the social system, which due to careful modeling will have fairly predictable effects.

This reaffirms the work of [[Donella Meadows]], as expressed in her classic essay on [[Twelve leverage points|Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System]]. The final page stated that:

:"The higher the leverage point, the more the system will resist changing it."

Here Meadows refers to the leverage point for resolving the proper coupling subproblem rather than the leverage point for overcoming change resistance. This is because the current focus of environmentalism is on proper coupling.

However, if the leverage points associated with the root causes of change resistance exist and can be found, the system will not resist changing them. This is an important principle of social system behavior.

For example, Harich found the main root cause of successful systemic change resistance to be high "deception effectiveness." The source was special interests, particularly large for-profit corporations. The high leverage point was raising "general ability to detect manipulative deception." This can be done with a variety of solution elements, such as "The Truth Test." This effectively increases truth literacy, just as conventional education raises reading and writing [[literacy]]. Few citizens resist literacy education because its benefits have become so obvious.

Promotion of [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) has been used to try to overcome change resistance to solving social problems, including environmental sustainability. This solution strategy has not worked well because it is voluntary and does not resolve root causes. [[Milton Friedman]] explained why CSR fails: "The social responsibility of business is to increase profits." &lt;ref&gt;"The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits", Milton Friedman, September 13, 1970, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', available at [http://www.colorado.edu/studentgroups/libertarians/issues/friedman-soc-resp-business.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Business cannot be responsible to society. It can only be responsible to its shareholders.

'''TRIUMF''' is [[Canada]]'s national [[Particle Accelerator|particle accelerator]] centre. It is considered Canada's premier [[physics]] laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2015 Budget, Chapter 3.1 – Supporting the Manufacturing Sector and Investing in Advanced Research|url=http://www.budget.gc.ca/2015/docs/plan/ch3-1-eng.html|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is consistently regarded as one of the leading [[subatomic]] physics research centers on the international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An inside look at TRIUMF, the world’s biggest cyclotron|url=http://www.macleans.ca/society/science/an-inside-look-at-triumf-the-worlds-biggest-cyclotron/ |website=Maclean's magazine|publisher=Maclean's magazine|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owned and operated by a consortium of universities as a joint venture, TRIUMF is located on the south campus of one of its founding members – the [[University of British Columbia]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. TRIUMF houses the world's largest [[cyclotron]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-7000/largest-cyclotron/&lt;/ref&gt; a source of 520 MeV protons, which was named an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:List_of_IEEE_Milestones |title=List of IEEE Milestones |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; TRIUMF's accelerator-focused activities involve particle physics, nuclear physics, [[nuclear medicine]], [[materials science]], and detector and accelerator development.

There are over 500 scientists, engineers, technicians, tradespeople, administrative staff, postdoctoral fellows, and students on the TRIUMF site. The lab attracts over 1000 national and international researchers every year and has generated over $1B in economic impact activity over the last decade.

TRIUMF scientists and university-based physicists develop and implement [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council]]'s (NSERC) long-range plan for subatomic physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perspectives on Subatomic Physics in Canada 2006–2016|url=http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/_doc/Reports-Rapports/LRP_Report_eng.pdf|website=NSERC|publisher=NSERC|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TRIUMF uses these plans to develop its own priorities.  TRIUMF has over 50 international agreements for collaborative scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Partnerships|url=http://www.triumf.ca/home/about-triumf/partners/international-partners|website=TRIUMF|publisher=TRIUMF|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asteroid [[14959 TRIUMF]] is named in honour of the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asteroid (14959) TRIUMF|url=http://www.rasc.ca/asteroids/asteroid-14959-triumf|website=Royal Astronomical Society of Canada|publisher=Royal Astronomical Society of Canada|accessdate=February 28, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306100242/http://www.rasc.ca/asteroids/asteroid-14959-triumf|archivedate=March 6, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

TRIUMF was founded in 1968 by [[Simon Fraser University]], the University of British Columbia, and the [[University of Victoria]] in order to meet research needs that no single university could provide. The original acronym, stemming from the name TRI University Meson Facility, was dropped and is no longer used to reflect TRIUMF's current state as a consortium of 19 universities. TRIUMF currently has 19 member and associate universities from across [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.triumf.ca/home/about-triumf/history|website=TRIUMF: Canada's national lab for particle and nuclear physics|publisher=TRIUMF|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Triumf Front Signboard.jpg|thumb|TRIUMF entrance]]

Since its inception as a local university facility, TRIUMF has evolved into a national laboratory while still maintaining strong ties to the research programs of Canadian universities. The science program has expanded from nuclear physics to include particle physics, molecular and materials science, nuclear medicine, and accelerator research and development.

TRIUMF's 520 MeV cyclotron was officially commissioned on February 9, 1976 by [[Pierre Trudeau]], the 15th's [[Prime Minister of Canada]]. At the commissioning ceremony, he said "I don't really know what a cyclotron is, but I am certainly very happy Canada has one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Particle physics lab TRIUMF invites artists to connect science to society|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/triumf-artist-residence-40-years-1.3440572|website=CBC.ca |publisher=CBC |accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Riken]] SRC (superconducting ring cyclotron) was built, TRIUMF was the world's largest cyclotron in terms of weight and beam or magnetic field radius.  The Riken SRC is now heavier than the TRIUMF cyclotron, but TRIUMF has the largest beam radius and the largest vacuum tank. The Riken magnetic field covers from 3.5 m to 5.5 m radius with the maximum beam radius of about {{convert|5|m|in}}. The TRIUMF field goes from 0 to about 320 inches radius with the maximum beam radius of 310 inches. This is because it requires a lower magnetic field to reduce EM stripping.

===Laboratory directors===

==Organizational structure==
The facility is organized into four divisions that focus on varying aspects of research and operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organizational Structure|url=http://www.triumf.ca/home/about-triumf/governance-organization/organizational-structure |publisher=TRIUMF|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accelerator Division===
The Accelerator Division has operational, maintenance, and required upgrade responsibility for all of the 520 MeV Cyclotron, ISAC, and TR-13 facilities. The division also has responsibility for the design, construction, and commissioning of future accelerators on-site, and it provides support for external accelerator projects.

===Engineering Division===
The Engineering Division has general responsibilities for the engineering, design and fabrication of mechanical, structural and electronic components.  The division also has responsibility for electrical and mechanical services and site maintenance.

===Physical Sciences Division===
The Physical Sciences Division is responsible for scheduling experiments approved by the Experimental Evaluation Committee (EEC).  The division is also responsibility for the design, installation, operation and maintenance of components, systems and subsystems for all experimental operations at the TRIUMF site.  Lastly, it is also responsible for the coordination of infrastructure support for external programs.

===Life Sciences Division===
The Life Sciences Division is responsible for the support of projects approved by the Life Science Projects Evaluation Committee (LSPEC) and provides support for collaborations with the Pacific Parkinson's Research Centre (PPRC), [[BC Cancer Agency]] (BCCA), [[Nordion]] and other university faculties relying on radio-tracers from TRIUMF for their research.  This division is also responsible for the design, installation, operation and maintenance of components, systems and subsystems for the radioisotope production and processing facilities for tracers to be used in research projects both at TRIUMF and at other laboratories. TRIUMF's nuclear medicine department is part of this division.

===Office of the Director===
The Director, supported by the Deputy Director, has general oversight responsibilities for the following administrative departments: accounting and finance; environmental health and safety; general administration and security; human resources; procurement; quality assurance; strategic planning; communications and outreach; and supply chain management.  Additional oversight is given to the Applied Technology Group consisting of several work teams including Isotope Production, Cyclotron Operations, and Technical Support.  This group focuses on the production of radioactive isotopes for use by Nordion, a global life sciences company that provides products and services that are used in the development of drugs and diagnosis and treatment of disease.

===TRIUMF Innovations===
[https://www.triumfinnovations.ca/ TRIUMF Innovations] is the commercialization arm of TRIUMF, linking the laboratories activities with tangible business and commercialization opportunies. TRIUMF Innovations [http://www.newswise.com/articles/from-research-to-reality-triumf-innovations-to-unleash-canada-s-world-leading-capabilities-in-the-physical-sciences was established in 2017], replacing Advanced Applied Physics Solutions, Inc. (AAPS), TRIUMF's previous commercialization entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aapsinc.com/about-aaps/company-profile/ |title = About AAPS |publisher = AAPS, Inc. |accessdate = 9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==
TRIUMF selectively applies its expertise to other areas of research and to the generation of entrepreneurial opportunities. Thus, the core program of nuclear, particle, and accelerator physics has expanded to cover key niche areas in life sciences and molecular and materials science.

===Main cyclotron and proton beam lines===
At the heart of TRIUMF is the 500 MeV cyclotron that produces the primary proton beams. A large fraction of the TRIUMF program relies on these beams, including the ISAC, the Centre for Molecular and Materials Science programs in μSR and β-NMR, and the Proton Treatment Facility. The operation of the main cyclotron has enabled TRIUMF to acquire the expertise to operate the three medical cyclotrons for Nordion and the TR-13 medical cyclotron used to produce medical isotopes, and assist companies to exploit commercial opportunities for the sale of cyclotron and other accelerator technologies.

====The 520 MeV cyclotron====
TRIUMF produces negatively charged hydrogen ions (H⁻: 1 proton, 2 electrons) from an ion source. The ions are transported through an evacuated electrostatic beam line containing elements to focus and steer the beam over 60m to the cyclotron. The 520 MeV (million electron volts) variable energy cyclotron accelerates these ions with a high frequency alternating electric field and uses a massive six-sector magnet to confine the beam in an outward spiral trajectory. Inserting a very thin graphite extraction foil strips, or removes, the electrons from the H⁻ ion while allowing the proton to pass through. The proton, because it is a positively charged particle, is deflected in the outward direction due to the magnetic field and is directed to a proton beam line.

The accelerating process takes approximately 0.3 ms before the proton achieves three-quarters the speed of light. The success of TRIUMF's programs depends on the ability to deliver protons from the cyclotron reliably. Typically, the cyclotron, although over 35 years old, averages an up-time of greater than 90% (2000–2007), with the 15-year average just under 90%. Typically the beam is delivered for about 5,000 hours per year with one major (three month) and one minor (one month) maintenance periods. The cyclotron beam properties and capabilities have improved over the years as a result of systems upgrades and the fundamental infrastructure providing the magnetic and electrical fields and the RF [[resonator]]s as well as the vacuum vessel will serve TRIUMF for many more years.

====The Four Proton Beamlines====
TRIUMF has four independent extraction probes with various sizes of foils to provide protons simultaneously to up to four beam lines. Because of the high energy of the proton beam, these [[beamline]]s use magnetic rather than electrostatic focusing and steering elements.

;Beamline 1A (BL1A) : can deliver 180 to 500 MeV protons to two target systems. The beam power ranges from 50 to 75&amp;nbsp;kW. The first target, T1, services three experimental channels. The second target, T2, services two μSR experimental channels. Downstream of T2 is a 500 MeV facility used to produce strontium isotopes for medical-imaging generators as well as the Thermal Neutron Facility (TNF).

;Beamline 1B : separates off BL1 at the edge of the cyclotron vault and provides international users with the Proton Irradiation Facility (PIF) that is used for radiation testing of electronic circuits, for example, mimicking space radiation for testing computer chips.

;Beamline 2A (BL2A) : capable of providing 475 to 500 MeV proton beams at up to 50&amp;nbsp;kW to the ISAC target facility that produces rare-isotope ion beams for a host of Canadian and international experiments.

;Beamline 2C (BL2C) : used for the Proton Therapy Program to treat choroidal melanomas (eye tumours) and proton irradiation to produce strontium isotopes, which are chemically processed and then used for medical imaging generators. This beam line also has the flexibility to provide protons of lower energy for PIF users. The energy range for this line is 70 to 120 MeV.

;Beamline 4 North (BL4N) : (expected completion 2017), will be a new 500 MeV beamline used for the proposed expansion of ISAC with a specialized actinide target.

===ISAC facilities for rare-isotope beams===
The ISAC facility produces and uses heavy ion beams to produce short-lived isotopes for study. A proton beam from the main accelerator is used to produce beams of exotic [[isotopes]] which are further accelerated using [[linear accelerators]]. Several experiments study the properties and structure of these exotic isotopes along with their [[nucleosynthesis]].  Between ISAC-I and ISAC-II, many experiments can be completed.

====ISAC-I facility====
In the ISAC-I facility, 500 MeV protons at up to 100 μA can be steered onto one of two production targets to produce radioactive isotopes. The isotopes pass through a heated tube to a source where they are ionized, accelerated off the source's high-voltage platform at up to 60 kV and sent through a mass separator to select the ion beam of choice. The beam is transported in the low-energy beam transport (LEBT) electrostatic beam line and sent via a switch-yard to either the low-energy experimental area or to a series of room-temperature accelerating structures to the ISAC-I medium-energy experimental area. Experiments at ISAC-I include:

=====8π spectrometer=====
A microscope used to examine the behaviour of atomic nuclear produced, which are collected at the centre of 8pi where they undergo radioactive decay.  The main component of the 8π spectrometer are the Hyper-pure Germanium detectors used to observe gamma rays emitted from excited states of daughter nuclei. [http://www.triumf.info/wiki/tigwiki/index.php/8pi]

=====DRAGON=====
The Detector of Recoils And Gammas Of Nuclear Reactions (DRAGON) is an apparatus designed to measure the rates of nuclear reactions important in astrophysics, particularly nucleosynthesis reactions which occur in the explosives environments of nova, supernova, and x-ray bursters.

=====Laser spectroscopy=====
The Collinear Fast-Beam Laser Spectroscopy (CFBS) experiment at TRIUMF is designed to exploit the high beam-intensity and radioisotope-production capability of TRIUMF's ISAC facility, as well as modern ion-trap beam-cooling techniques, in order to measure the hyperfine energy levels and isotope shifts of short-lived isotopes using laser spectroscopy. [http://www.triumf.ca/laser-spectroscopy]

=====TITAN=====
TRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear Science (TITAN) measures the mass of short-lived isotopes with high precision.  Radioactive isotopes from ISAC are sent to TITAN to undergo cooling, charge-breeding and trapping.  The entire process occurs in about 10 milliseconds, allowing radioactive isotopes with short half lives to be studied. [http://titan.triumf.ca/]

=====TRINAT=====
TRINAT, TRIUMF's Neutral Atom Trap, holds a cluster of neutral atoms suspended in a very small space, in high vacuum, allowing for the study of decay products of radioactive atoms. [http://trshare.triumf.ca/~trinat/website/trinat_exp]

====ISAC-II facility====

The rare-isotope beams produced in the ISAC-II facility are transported in the low-energy beam transport (LEBT) electrostatic beam line and sent via a switch-yard to either the low-energy experimental area or to a series of room-temperature accelerating structures in the ISAC-I medium-energy experimental area. For high-energy delivery, the drift tube linac (DTL) beam is deflected north along an S-bend transfer line to the ISAC-II superconducting linear accelerator (SC-linac) for acceleration above the Coulomb barrier (5–11 MeV/u). TRIUMF began developing superconducting accelerator technology in 2001 and is now a leader in the field with a demonstrated accelerating gradient (at low beta) significantly above other operating facilities. Experiments at ISAC-II include:

=====EMMA=====
The ElectroMagnetic Mass Analyzer (EMMA) (completion date 2016) is a recoil mass spectrometer for TRIUMF's ISAC-II facility. ISAC-II will provide intense beams of radioactive ions with masses up to 150 atomic mass units to international scientists studying nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics. The energies of these beams will depend on the specific nuclei being accelerated, but typical top speeds will range from 10–20% of the speed of light. [http://davids.triumf.ca/emma.htm]

=====HERACLES=====
Formerly known as the Chalk River/Laval array, HERACLES consists of 150 scintillators detectors covering almost 4-pi. It was used in over a dozen of experiments in the last ten years for multi-fragmentation studies at intermediate energies (10 to 100 MeV/A). [http://legacyweb.triumf.ca/tug/agm2000/HERACLES.html]

=====TIGRESS=====
The TRIUMF-ISAC Gamma-Ray Escape Suppressed Spectrometer (TIGRESS) is a state-of-the art new gamma-ray spectrometer designed for a broad program of nuclear physics research with the accelerated radioactive ion beams provided by the ISAC-II superconducting linear accelerator. [http://tigress.triumf.ca/]

====ISAC-I/II====
The experiments listed below utilize both facilities.

=====TUDA=====
A general purpose facility for studying nuclear reactions of astrophysical significance with [[semiconductor detector|solid state detectors]].[http://tuda.triumf.ca]

=====TACTIC=====
An [[Particle detector|ionization chamber]] with full track reconstruction capabilities for studying reactions of astrophysical importance.[http://tactic.triumf.ca]

=====DSL=====
TRIUMF's [[Doppler Shift]] Lifetimes facility, which is an experimental setup for the measurement of the lifetimes of excited states of nuclei.[http://davids.triumf.ca/dsl.htm]

===ATLAS Canadian Tier-1 Data Centre===
The [[ATLAS experiment]] at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) at [[CERN]] uses proton-proton collisions at the highest energy ever achieved in the laboratory to look for the [[Higgs Boson]], the particle central to the current model of how subatomic particles attain mass. ATLAS will also search for phenomena "beyond the standard model" of particle physics such as [[supersymmetry]], extra dimensions, and quark compositeness. The ATLAS detector will observe the particles emerging from the roughly 900 million proton-proton collisions per second and, although fast electronics will filter the events so that only those most likely to be of interest will be recorded, ATLAS will produce 3.5–5.0 petabytes of data per year (one petabyte is one million gigabytes). In addition, secondary data sets will be produced that could double the amount of data produced.

In order to analyze this enormous amount of information, CERN is coordinating an international network of large high-performance computing centres that are linked by [[grid computing]] tools so that they act as one huge system. This network is called the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG). The Canadian Tier-1 Data Centre, located at TRIUMF, works with nine of the other ATLAS Tier-1 centres in the world to process the raw data produced by the experiment. In addition, Tier-2 centres located in universities, both in Canada and abroad, are used to further process the results of the Tier-1 analysis and extract groundbreaking physics results from the data. The Tier-2 centres will also be the primary sites for computer simulations of ATLAS, which is an integral part of the data analysis.

===Centre for Molecular and Materials Science===
TRIUMF uses subatomic particles as probes of materials structure at the Centre for Molecular and Materials Science (CMMS).  The chief techniques are μSR and β-NMR.

====μSR====
TRIUMF utilizes a technique called μSR, a powerful probe into materials like semiconductors, magnets and superconductors. Beams of positive [[muon]]s are created with their spins lined up in the same direction. When these beams are shot into a material, the muons' spins precess (wobble like a top) around the local magnetic fields in the material. The unstable muons soon decay into positrons; since these [[positron|antielectrons]] tend to be emitted in the direction of the muons' spin, μSR scientists can examine how the internal magnetic fields of different materials have affected the muons' spins by observing the directions in which the positrons are emitted.

====β-NMR====
β detected NMR is an exotic form of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) in which the nuclear spin precession signal is detected through the beta decay of a radioactive nucleus. The central question to be studied is how the local electronic and magnetic properties near an interface or surface of new materials (e.g.,. a high Tc superconductor) differ from those of the bulk.

===Laboratory for Advanced Detector Development===
TRIUMF uses its expertise gained from the development of detectors for particle and nuclear physics, in collaboration with Canadian universities, to support advanced detector development for molecular and materials sciences and nuclear medicine.  TRIUMF's detector group designs and constructs electronic signal processing systems needed to handle the large volumes of data from modern detectors.

===Nuclear Medicine Laboratories===
The core of the TRIUMF nuclear medicine program is [[Positron Emission Tomography]] or PET imaging, a technique whereby tiny amounts of radioactive nuclei known as radioisotopes are combined with certain bio-molecules and injected into the body. The biomolecules can be “traced” by imaging the decay products (two photons produced by the decay of the radioactive nucleus via the emission of a positron) outside the body. PET allows the concentration of positron-labeled compounds to be determined quantitatively in space and time within the living body. PET is more sensitive than any other human imaging method, such as [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] or [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]], especially for the detection of cancer.

The PET program facilities at TRIUMF include cyclotron systems for the production of radioisotopes, chemistry labs for the synthesis of radiopharmaceuticals and quality control labs. TRIUMF currently uses the TR-13 medical cyclotron and target systems for the production of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C, and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N. Radiopharmaceutical production facilities include the small modular clean room at the cyclotron for the synthesis of [[Fludeoxyglucose|&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).]] for BCCA as well as three chemistry annex labs for production and development of radiopharmaceuticals used in brain research and other programs at UBC.

Pacific Parkinson's Research Centre (PPRC) is a joint TRIUMF/UBC program studying central nervous system disorders. Approximately 80% of the studies are related to [[Parkinson's disease]], and the remainder are related to mood disorders and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The program has explored the origins, progression, and therapies of the disease as well as the complications arising from therapy using molecular imaging as the primary tool.

The Functional Imaging Program at the BCCA is a collaboration among the agency, TRIUMF, UBC, and the [[BC Children's Hospital]]. Capital acquired through the BC Provincial Health Services Authority Emerging Technologies Fund allowed purchase of the province's first hybrid PET/CT scanner in 2004. The clinical PET/CT program, located at BCCA's Vancouver Centre, was enabled by TRIUMF supplying &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F, the positron emitting radionuclide used in production of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). FDG, as a marker of glucose metabolism, is the tracer used in oncologic PET imaging, a diagnostic study which has become a standard of care in the management of many cancer types.

===Proton and Neutron Irradiation Facilities===
Beginning in 1995, TRIUMF has built up several beamlines that provide low-intensity, energetic proton and neutron beams to simulate radiation exposures either in space or terrestrial environments. Even at low intensity, several minutes of exposure in these beams can correspond to years of operation in space, air, or ground so that accelerated testing of electronics can be carried out.

These TRIUMF facilities, PIF &amp; NIF, have since become recognized as premier test sites for space-radiation effects using protons and, with the capability of using these protons to produce a neutron-energy spectrum similar to that found at aircraft altitudes and at ground level, testing with neutrons is also possible. A large fraction of the proton users are Canadian space-related companies such as [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates|MDA Corporation]], while neutron use is primarily by international companies for avionics, microelectronics and communications equipment, such as [[Boeing|The Boeing Company]] or [[Cisco Systems|Cisco Systems, Inc]].

Additionally, one of the beamlines is used for the cancer treatment of [[Uveal melanoma|ocular melanoma]] at the Proton Therapy Centre which is operated in conjunction with the BC Cancer Agency and the UBC Department of Ophthalmology. Before proton treatment became available, the most common course of action was removal of the eye. Other possible treatments included surgical removal of the tumour (which has severe limitations), or implanting a radioactive disk on the wall of the eye under the tumour for some days. These alternatives were unsuitable for large tumours, and could damage sensitive parts of the eye, often resulting in loss of vision. After proton therapy, however, patients can retain useful vision. The protons enter the eye at a carefully controlled energy, and come to rest at a precise, predictable distance inside. They deposit their energy of motion (kinetic energy) in a very narrow layer, destroying living cells in that layer. Because the beam of protons is so concentrated and deposits its energy so predictably, we can successfully destroy a tumour while better preserving the other nearby parts of the eye.

==External scientific collaborations==
TRIUMF is also involved in the development and construction of detectors and equipment for larger particle physics experiments located all over the world.

===ALPHA===
The international [[ALPHA Collaboration]], focused on trapping [[antihydrogen]] with experiments based at [[CERN]], includes members from TRIUMF.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collaboration|url=http://alpha.web.cern.ch/collaboration|publisher=CERN|accessdate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ALPHA-Canada team, led by TRIUMF research scientist Dr. Makoto C. Fujiwara, was recognized with the 2013 [[NSERC]] John C. Polanyi Award for their work with the ALPHA team at CERN in understanding [[antimatter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Members Of ALPHA Win NSERC John C. Polanyi Award|url=http://alpha.web.cern.ch/node/263|publisher=CERN|accessdate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Canadian team included over a dozen scientists and students working in [[Plasma Physics|plasma]], [[Atomic physics|atomic]], [[Condensed matter physics|condensed matter]], [[Particle physics|particle]], [[Particle detector|detector]], and [[accelerator physics]], from the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC), [[Simon Fraser University]] (SFU), the [[University of Calgary]], [[York University]], and TRIUMF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 NSERC NSERC John C.

===KEK===
TRIUMF has a longstanding collaborative relationship with Japan's [[KEK]], which was further enhanced in December, 2015 when it was announced that each organization would be establishing branch offices at the other's respective institution to facilitate the advancement of their physics research activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada and Japan strengthen partnership to advance physics research|url=http://www.interactions.org/cms/?pid=1035361|publisher=Interactions.org|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Large Hadron Collider===
TRIUMF accelerator physicists, engineers, and technical personnel have unique expertise for the design and construction of critical parts of the accelerator, such as assembling the liquid [[argon]] end cap [[calorimeter]]s for the [[ATLAS detector]]. As well, TRIUMF was involved in the construction and procurement of several magnets and power supplies for the LHC itself. The resulting accelerator contributions were a necessary part of the Canadian investment in the project. TRIUMF is also home to the ATLAS-Canada Tier-1 Data Centre, funded by the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]]. This centre will pre-process the raw data from the experiment prior to analysis by Canadian and foreign researchers. It will also provide domestic detector experts access to raw data for detailed calibration and monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ATLAS-Canada Tier-1 Data Centre at TRIUMF|url=http://grid.triumf.ca/public/|publisher=TRIUMF|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SNO===
TRIUMF first became actively involved in the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO) when the project needed engineering help. TRIUMF's Design Office and Machine Shop built key components of the detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reflections on the Nobel Prize in Physics|url=http://www.triumf.ca/awards-honours/reflections-nobel-prize-physics|website=TRIUMF|publisher=TRIUMF|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, TRIUMF scientists were involved in the project which was honored with the 2015 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] and the 2016 [[Fundamental Physics Prize]] for the discovery of [[neutrino oscillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2015|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2015/|website=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laureates|url=https://breakthroughprize.org/Laureates/1/L151|website=breakthroughprize.org|publisher=Breakthrough Prize|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SNOLAB===
TRIUMF is involved with a number of projects at [[SNOLAB]]. Notable examples include the [[Helium and Lead Observatory]] (HALO) [[supernova]] [[neutrino]] detector which is part of the [[Supernova Early Warning System|SuperNova Early Warning System (SNEWS)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HALO: Detector of Opportunity|url=http://www.triumf.ca/current-events/halo-detector-opportunity|publisher=TRIUMF|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dark Matter Experiment using Argon Pulse-shape discrimination]] (DEAP) the most sensitive [[weakly interacting massive particle]] (WIMP) detector to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The DEAP-3600 Experiment|url=http://deap3600.ca|publisher=DEAP|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===T2K===
TRIUMF is part of the [[T2K]] ([[Tokai, Ibaraki|Tokai]]-to-[[Kamioka Observatory|Kamioka]]) [[neutrino]] oscillation experiment in [[Japan]]. TRIUMF is involved in constructing a [[time projection chamber]] and fine-grained detectors composed of plastic scintillators for the T2K ''near detector'', to measure the properties of the neutrino beam at its production site in Tokai before it travels 295&amp;nbsp;km to Kamioka, over which distance neutrino oscillations are expected to take place.

==TRIUMF Users' Group==
The TRIUMF Users Group (TUG) is an international community of scientists and engineers with a special interest in the use of the TRIUMF facility. Its purpose is:
* to provide a formal means for exchange of information relating to the development and use of the facility;
* to advise members of the entire TRIUMF organization of projects and facilities available;
* to provide an entity responsive to the representations of its members for offering advice and counsel to the TRIUMF management on operating policy and facilities.
Any qualified scientist can join the users group. The group's interests are looked after by an elected committee (TRIUMF Users' Executive Committee or TUEC). Part of TUEC's responsibilities is to organize meetings on behalf of the membership were necessary. At least one meeting, the annual general meeting (AGM), is held each year near the beginning of December. A link to the TUG website is listed in the external links below.

{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2018}}

In [[literary criticism]] and [[rhetoric]], a '''tautology''' is a statement which repeats the same idea, using near-synonymous morphemes, words, or phrases, that is, "saying the same thing twice".&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tautology and [[pleonasm]] are not consistently differentiated in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan Szymanek, "Remarks on Tautology in Word-Formation" in Laurie Bauer, ''et al.'', ''Semantics of Complex Words'', ''Studies in Morphology'' '''3''', 2015, {{isbn|3319141023}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLkPBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146 p. 142]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[pleonasm]], it is often considered a fault of [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]] when unintentional. On the other hand, an intentional repetition may be an effective way to emphasize a thought, or help the listener or reader understand a point.&lt;ref name="bascom"&gt;John Bascom, ''Philosophy of Rhetoric'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y54CAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA241 p. 241]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sometimes [[tautology (logic)|logical tautologies]] like "Boys will be boys" are conflated with language tautologies, but in general, a rhetorical tautology is not inherently true.&lt;ref name="bascom"/&gt;

==Etymology==

The word was coined in Hellenistic Greek from ταὐτός ("the same") plus λόγος ("word/idea"), and transmitted through 3rd-century Latin ''tautologia'' and French ''tautologie''. It first appears in English in the 16th century. The use in the term [[tautology (logic)|logical tautology]] was introduced in English by [[Wittgenstein]] in 1919, perhaps following [[Auguste Comte]]'s usage in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition, 2014, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/198205 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* "With malice toward none, with charity for all," from [[Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Ament, "Glossary of Rhetorical Terms" [https://mcl.as.uky.edu/glossary-rhetorical-terms]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
Intentional repetition of meaning intends to amplify or emphasize a particular, usually significant, fact about what is being discussed. For example, a [[gift]] is, by definition, free of charge; using the phrase "free gift" might emphasize that there are no hidden conditions or [[fine print]], be it the expectation of money or reciprocation, or that the gift is being given by [[volition (psychology)|volition]].

This is related to the [[rhetoric]]al device of [[hendiadys]], where one concept is expressed through the use of two descriptive words or phrases.  For example, "goblets and gold" meaning wealth, or "this day and age" meaning the present time. Superficially these expressions may seem tautological, but they are stylistically sound because the repeated meaning is just a way to emphasize the same idea.

The use of tautologies is, however, usually unintentional. For example, the phrases "mental telepathy", "planned conspiracies", and "small dwarfs" imply that there are such things as "physical telepathy, spontaneous conspiracies, and giant dwarfs."&lt;ref name=Kallan&gt;{{cite book|last=Kallan|first=Richard|title=Armed Gunmen, True Facts, and Other Ridiculous Nonsense: A Compiled Compendium of Repetitive Redundancies|year=2005|publisher=Pantheon Books|isbn=0-375-42352-4|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Parallelism (rhetoric)|Parallelism]] is not tautology, but rather a particular stylistic device. Much [[Old Testament]] [[poetry]] is based on [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]: the same thing said twice, but in slightly different ways (Fowler&lt;ref name="Fowler"/&gt; puts it as [[pleonasm]]). However, modern biblical study emphasizes that there are subtle distinctions and developments between the two lines, such that they are usually not truly the "same thing." Parallelism can be found wherever there is poetry in the Bible: [[Psalms]], the [[Books of the Prophets]], and in other areas as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6353">The '''Virtual Global University''' ('''VGU''') is a [[virtual university]] offering online [[distance education]] or [[virtual education]] on the [[Internet]].

==Organization==

The Virtual Global University (VGU) is a private organization founded in 2001 by 17 professors of [[Business Informatics]] from 14 different universities in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. The VGU brings together the knowledge and experience of people from different universities in one [[virtual business|virtual organization]]. At the same time it is a real organization, according to German civil law under the name "VGU Private Virtual Global University GmbH".

Within the Virtual Global University, the School of Business Informatics (SBI) is the organizational unit that offers online courses and an online study program.

==Studies==

The focus of VGU's study offerings is [[information technology]] (IT) and [[management]]—or [[Business Informatics]] as it is called in Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, B., J. Valacich, R. Watson, R. Zmud and et al., What Every Business Student Needs to Know About Information Systems, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, (9:30) December, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doukidis, G.: et al. (Ed.): Proceedings of the 3rd European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS '95). Athens 1995, pp.1295–1297&lt;/ref&gt; Students of [[Business Informatics]] (BI) are taught how to use IT effectively to develop business solutions for global challenges.

All courses offered by the VGU are based on the Internet as well as on commonly available information and communication technology and are given entirely, or are substantially supported, by means of electronic media. The MBI can be conducted either in English or in German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Annette |last=Bauer |title=Neuer Wirtschaftsinformatik-Master für Berufstätige startet |url=http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news317473 |work=Abteilung Presse- und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit Europa-Universität Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder)|date=2009-05-28 |accessdate = 2009-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MBI program===

The VGU offers a master's program leading to the degree of an "International [[Master of Business Informatics]]" (MBI). The creation of the MBI was supported by the German "Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung" (federal ministry of education and research) within the program "New Media in Education". The program is accredited by government as well as by [[ACQUIN]]. The [[master's degree]] is awarded by the [[European University Viadrina]] (EUV) in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany in cooperation with the VGU. While the latter one provides expertise and teaching for the program, EUV is responsible for ensuring that the academic and educational standards of the program are maintained at an appropriate level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medien-bildung.net&lt;/ref&gt;

===Certificate courses===

Independent certificate courses on a number of IT and [[management]] topics are offered in addition to the master program MBI.

==Faculty and management==

===Head===

'''WiRED International''' is a 501(c)(3)non-profit, volunteer-driven organization that has been delivering medical and health information to war-affected and underserved regions since 1997. WiRED International’s goal is to address the severe global inequality of health knowledge.

WiRED International provides health information to underdeveloped areas by delivering programs, equipment and coordinated health education. Over the years, the organization has opened facilities in 15 countries, while NGOs, medical schools and hospitals in many additional countries have adopted its programs for community health education. The organization serves remote regions and, when appropriate, supplies laptops, projectors, solar equipment and complete health education libraries.

All WiRED International’s resources online and on portable media are cost-free to users.

WiRED International’s educational programs are technology-based. Starting in the 1990s, the organization stored programs on floppy disks and CD-ROMS and today relies on the Internet and flash drives. With this technology, people can put hundreds of training programs in their pockets, to take beyond the grid. These programs can be run on portable laptops and projectors for group presentations.

In 2009, the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health awarded WiRED International its Organizational Public Health Hero Award. WiRED earned the award “for its achievements in using information technology to provide up-to-date health education and medical information in developing, post-conflict, and isolated regions of the world.”

== History ==
San Francisco State University professor, Gary Selnow, Ph.D., founded WiRED International in 1997 while on a Fulbright Fellowship as a visiting professor at the [[University of Zagreb]] in Croatia right after the [[Yugoslav War]]. Selnow said, “UNICEF had donated computers to a high school in [[Vukovar]], Croatia, but they were sitting in boxes. We connected them to the Internet.”

Within two years, after formally registering as an NGO, WiRED International had established technology-based programs in six of the former Yugoslav countries. The U.S. Department of State engaged WiRED International’s services in Bosnia and then in Kosovo, where the organization’s volunteers set up community-access Internet centers to help people find family members who fled during the conflict with Serbia. Dr. Selnow noted that physicians made up “the largest group visiting the centers in Kosovo.”

As a small and flexible organization, WiRED International can respond quickly to community needs. While most of its work deals with health education, occasionally the organization comes across circumstances that merit special attention. One example took place in Kosovo in 1999, where a number of children had been unable to receive adequate treatment for life-threatening illnesses because of a war-damaged health care system.

Selnow was traveling by van from [[Pristina|Prishtina]] (Priština), Kosovo, to [[Skopje]], Macedonia, which, at the time, had the nearest operational airport. In the van was a five-year-old boy and a nurse. The nurse explained that [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]] was funding the boy’s travel to France for heart surgery, but that budgets couldn’t pay for his parents to go along. “Will you go with him?” Selnow asked. “No, I’ll drop him off and someone from the hospital will meet him at [[de Gaulle Airport]].”

“So, this boy will undergo open-heart surgery without anyone to hold his hand and tell him in his Albanian language that he’ll be fine?” The nurse said, “That’s how it is, I’m sorry.”

Soon afterwards, WiRED International set up a program it called “Video Visit,” where a computer in [[Prishtina]] (Priština), where the parents remained, and a computer in the host country, where the children were being treated, could connect via the Internet. The connections allowed the parents and the children to speak on a regular basis and stay in touch during the children’s often extended treatments. WiRED International’s Video Visit wasn’t set up in time for the boy in the van, but it operated for many other children set off in the months that followed.

WiRED International’s mission became focused on medical and health education as a result of the clear needs evident in Kosovo. A year later, with a National Institutes of Health developmental grant, WiRED began HIV/AIDS education programs across Kenya and then in Sierra Leone. The work expanded to all medical and health concerns, and today through partnerships, WiRED programs are in several African countries and in parts of China, Central and South America, the Middle East, Melanesia and Eurasia.
 
In spring 2003 the State Department asked Selnow to travel to Baghdad with a representative of its U.S. Global Technology Corps to explore how WiRED could most effectively deliver medical training programs to Iraqi doctors. In June 2003, after reviewing field conditions and talking with U.S officials, Iraqi physicians and medical educators, WiRED launched the first technology-based medical training program in the country, starting with the opening of a facility in Iraq’s Medical City Center. Within 18 months the organization had set up 39 centers around Iraq. Several years later WiRED launched the country’s first telemedicine program. Technical problems with satellite availability in the war zone made that program difficult, and it never fully matured. WiRED’s work in Iraq ended in 2010, as the U.S. commitment was winding down.
 
In 2011, as WiRED’s ground programs expanded elsewhere, it began development of its own educational training materials. The program evolved, in 2013, into the Center for the Development and Distribution of Health Education Programs. This resource supplies medical and health education modules via the Internet and portable storage media. It allows partners or any interested NGO to store training modules on thumb drives and laptops and sync them to acquire updates. The result has been a broad distribution of health education programs, even in the most remote areas.
 
In 2014, WiRED has evolved into a health education hub operating in remote and resource-starved regions globally. WiRED collects intellectual content from physicians, nurses and medical educators from around the world. WiRED packages and translates it, when appropriate, and distributes it widely. This clearinghouse model has enabled many medical professionals to contribute to the program, and it has provided a source of health content for people in places isolated and often ignored.

== WiRED International’s Center for the Development and Distribution of Health Information ==
In 2011, WiRED International launched a virtual [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net Center] which draws intellectual content and resources from regions of abundance, processes it for new audiences and distributes that information to regions of scarcity. This project is funded in large part by [http://philanthropy.medtronic.com/ Medtronic Philanthropy].

The WiRED International e-library of more than 300 medical and health education modules enables physicians and nurses, patients, health workers and communities to address the prevention and treatment of both infectious and non-communicable disease in developing areas of the world. The more than 300 topics as diverse as maternal health and hand washing, rheumatic heart disease and Ebola, clean water strategies and home caregiver training.

In 2014 WiRED International expanded the global reach of its programs by creating a “Filling Station.” This is a tool that provides file synchronization (or syncing), whereby a person’s computer can upload data from a master file in an automatic process that adds new or changed material. Thus, the Filling Station allows instant updating of the entire community health education (CHE) e-library from any Internet access point in the world.

With these interactive training programs, communities and medical professionals alike can educate themselves through the material released on this website and also distributed on portable media for communities off the grid.

These training modules are developed by WiRED International’s team of physicians, medical editors, imagers and technicians along with a host of other medical experts. The team continually updates the existing material and creates new modules to provide a rich source of health information.

== Rapid Response Modules ==

When a community health crisis occurs, WiRED International speeds the creation of a rapid response module and translates it into appropriate languages. Examples include: 
* [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/mod-ebola.html Ebola] (translated into [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/presentations/58-fr/story.html French])
* [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/mod-malnutrition.html Severe Malnutrition] (translated into [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/presentations/121-ab/story.html Arabic])
* [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/mod-polio.html Polio] (translated into [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/presentations/117-ab/story.html Arabic] and [http://www.wiredhealthresources.net/presentations/117-ar/story.html Armenian])
